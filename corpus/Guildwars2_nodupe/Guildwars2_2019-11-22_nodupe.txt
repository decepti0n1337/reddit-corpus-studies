This is the same PR team that thought it was a good idea to rent out an entire theater (Something that has only been done for something as massive as the game's first expansion before) and hype up an entire announcement a week ahead just to sell us funko pops and hot topic tshirts.

I actually don't mind FF marketboard at all, the only thing that genuinely pisses me off is the cunts that are undercutting me all of the time, but the nice thing about FF is that *listing* doesn't cost any fees, so I'm not suffering any penalties for merely attempting to sell something.

You expect GW2 players who are the casual players of pretty much all MMOs to press hotkeys?
---
And who made you the authority of what does and what doesn't belong into an MMO?
---
At this point Im not sure if breathing isnt too much for them
---
Where's the squirrel image from?
---
Ehh, I never took the saga being "better than the seasons" to mean that every release would be bigger, especially since they specifically said that the plan was to release content more frequently, but not necessarily in one big contained map like in previous seasons. This could mean expansions on current maps, content that builds upon itself, and expansion level content. That may mean that one month we may not get a new episode at all, but instead get something "expansion level" such as a new playable race (Kodan?), new elite specs, a new class, etc. 
---
I agree that this episode was quite short, but that doesn't mean that all releases in the entire saga will follow the same formula (since a formulaic approach was something they specifically said they wanted to get away from), or that we won't get expac level content in future releases.
---
Yes, of course, but this holds true nevertheless. The reason is irrelevant, but its a fact that the sub loses active members.
---
Should have been more like triple trouble. Get it to appear around the map, attack out of nowhere. Then also have it be a world boss to with quite a few telegraphed attacks.
---
Meta chain leading up to it, maybe something like protecting a few camps from it, then following its tracks and tracking it down with a couple of vigil from multiple camps, leading to a world boss.
---
yes, though they have a visible despawn timer buff now
---
Those two "unknown" strikes will be different bosses in the same arena.

I wish it didn't have like a weird built in beard. I don't know if that's what it is but that's what it looks like
---
I don't think it directly benefits your guild, but it lets people pick up an additional 5 supply from camps and lets you "slot" consumable tactics from your guild into the structures Tactivators.
---
For the milionth time, it's not free. Its locked behind a paid expansion and in a few months time you'll have to pay extra beside PoF.
---
Free is free and because not everyone can play the "content" it means it's not free. It might be "free" for you since you bought the expansion but ask Bob who just started with GW2 last Thursday. Bob will have to pay to play said "free" content.
---
Please, don't remind me of GoT. I still have Vietnam flashbacks from this disaster.
---
Nice moving the goalposts there.
---
If the prologue was s5e1 wouldn't it come after the expansion?
---
Yeah sure sure, whatever you imagine. ;)
---
There are blind defenders as well. And just because those two camps of people exist it doesn't mean we can't try to understand why people are feeling the way they feel because it's not for no reason. There's problems that need to be addressed with the game.
---
Ok, lots of things going on in your post (including your gaming issues).
---
You probably need to find better things to do in the game. There are other options apart from doing hearts and the same repetitive events. 
---
* **Change what you play.** You could try dungeons; some people still run those (even better if you have friends or guildmates to join you). Those are instanced content for 5 people, which your hardware should handle. Or maybe a bit of PvP/WvW.
---
* **Do some crafting with the materials you gathered.** Crafting also gives experience for leveling, and you may even make money from selling to the TP, after a while.
---
* **Just walk around and explore the maps.** Immerse yourself in the gorgeous world of Tyria, do jumping puzzles, find nice places for screenshots. Exploration gives experience and it scales somewhat with your level, and with such a vast world, you have tons of potential XP.
---
* **Have some greater objective.** Whether it's gathering mats for crafting, doing achievements, completing collections etc, it's good to make you more motivated.
---
* **Test different builds.** Don't chain yourself to MetaBattle builds and SnowCrows rotations; find your style and experiment with new skills and traits.
---
* **Have breaks from leveling.** Whether it's just chatting with random people in Lion's Arch (some of the funniest conversations I've read lol), helping other people out, or even leaving the game for other hobbies.  Don't treat it as a job, we all have our greater responsibilities and obligations, and GW2 shouldn't be one of those.
---
Also, for your gaming rant (yes I did read it :P), gaming may ultimately be unproductive, but what does it matter? It's just a hobby, after all. The only thing you need to be productive at is your job (counting studying as a job if you're still in school or college). That "always productive" mindset might eventually turn your hobby into a second job, and you'll dread your enjoyment. As long as you don't neglect your personal life - including personal health, family, friends, career, and finances (roughly in that order) - gaming is a fine hobby. 
---
Also, consider that there are a lot of people you can connect with (including yours truly lol) and form a new friend circle. Heck, I consider some people that I met around Reddit as friends, even though we never met each other and don't even know their real names!
---
Truthfully, they never said. As usual they opted to be vague.
---
That's why I said "some of us."
---
&gt; (wrongly each time)
---
There is no wrong (or right) question. At the end of the maze you get a buff and since there is an achievement that shows that there are several different buffs, I think you get a different buff depending on your answers.
---
"I haven't tried it in the seven years" dafuq? Troll or retarded?
---
Tbh most people don't know what the fuck the difference is just tend to associate leshens with wendigos.
---
There's a big difference between "lower difficulty" and "free." That's what everything has been in the open world lately.  What's the point of building up a big baddy and kicking it in the shins and calling it a boss? Get real buddy.
---
&gt; And let's not even talk about debuting in Verdant Brink until you have gliding !
---
What about VB? The ground level is all reachable via walking and they won't let you get on a chopper without gliding.
---
You are also not a new player. Most people are not in the habit of jumping off cliffs and those who do probably don't live long enough to be playing games for long.
---
My biggest problem with this meme is that corvids are my favorite type of bird and I feel it unfairly stereotypes them. =)
---
The boneskinner is a theme park. I never said it wasnt. Every open world is, and when it wasnt (hot) people didnt like it.
---
Teach people to play, make traitlines not stupid imbalanced, give them Marauder instead of soldier, and even hot would be a theme park.
---
&gt;I keep asking but I get nothing but insults and snarky responses but why is it so important for the people that stay mad at the game to bitch at everybody that enjoys the game?
---
It's not important, the people who do that are assholes/trolls, as are those that bitch at people trying to give constructive feedback or politely express their dissatisfaction. There are plenty of people who are mad or at least disappointed with the game and its direction who don't bitch at people who enjoy the game, just how there are plenty of people who enjoy the game who don't bitch at people who are disappointed with it. In fact, most people who are mad/disappointed actually do love the game and just want it to get better. More importantly, I'd say that the assholes on both sides are each just extremely loud minorites, so while they're most of what you see due to how much they post and downvote actually reasonable posts, they're not representative of either "side," nor of the community as a whole.
---
Hell, I may be somewhat disappointed in how the game and communication have been handled recently and where the little bit of direction we see seems to be going, but I'm really happy for any and everyone who still enjoys it (heck, I still do, just less than I used to, and the incessant arguing between two camps of trolls doesn't help). There's still years of content for new players to go through, most of which hasn't been touched by poor decisions other than abandoning certain content/features and (imo) changing certain elite specs (Chrono and Scourge) to make them clunky and annoying to play (I don't care about their numbers or dps or anything, I just want them to be fun to play), although I'm sure people could and do still have plenty of fun with them.
---
Okay, but the episode is NOT just the story. Why does everyone judge the content simply on the length of the story chapter alone? There are achievements, rotating strikes...easily stuff to do for the next month or so.
---
So because we've got a long list of notable kills, you want us to just button mash our way through every boss, every obstacle we encounter now?  That makes for really uninteresting gameplay and storytelling.  "We're OP, so we'll always win!"  If that's the case, we should just roll through everything in one-shot-easy-mode since we're so powerful now.  Great idea!
---
Yes I have played it, and it's a boring, static pinata fight as myself and others have noted on this subreddit.  After Anet hyped up the Boneskinner as this unrelenting nightmarish menace, what is presented currently is nothing of the sort.  Clearly they wanted to inject some creepy and horror vibes into the game with this release, and all we're doing here is giving some suggestions of how it could or should of been.

---
&gt;  should have MORE features then season episodes
---
You misunderstand. SAGA it is because they don't want to strictly stick to epizodes. They want to release half of epizode now, and second half 2 months later, instead of single wait of 4 months. They want to release also stuff in between epizodes (yet to be seen). They want to destroy the "now release then 4 months wait" schedule. 
---
It is obvious that with this they will give us small pieces. IF the momentum will be as it looks like (aka bigger chunks every 2 months and maybe something in between), then this amount of content is quite justified. Let's see if the reality will be really like that though.
---
Well as I and others have said when the content starts narrowing content creators will start leaving the game.
---
It's a joke y'all.
---
Does that boss have any attacks? It feels so underwhelming fighting it
---
PvP is super fun for me too. I really have to stop staying up until 3 AM playing it though.
---
So, you basically want an open world dynamic event to be harder than Balthazar?
---
Duh?
---
I'll quote myself again: "You can be wrong without being a liar at the same time dude."
---
He did not necessarily imply you to be lying, just was correcting you.
---
You're not wrong. I had to set my UltraWide to black-bar the wide zones and get myself back down to 16:9 to play normally.
---
Turns out I still suck at StarCraft though.
---
Using the right terms really makes this obvious; thanks for the addition!  
---
Somehow I never came across the proper names for these, despite using the Alienware AW3418DW.  This should make it easier to explain what I'm talking about next time :D
---
I just read your whole post op.
---
If stuff were like that, the boner would have WAY too much weight in the map; it's just a random dragon minion from a dynamic event (not even a meta). 
---
You just like the thing a lot and wanted more of it, but it's just a filler (again, it's a dynamic event).
---
They have their own arena
---
hehe.  i want a combat tonic
---
Thank you very much!!!! &lt;3
---
No, the new placement is better
---
yes, we tap it so it lives.
---
if it ever happens, I assume it won't be until a good while tho, what I think Anet is doing right now with Icebrood is to test the water with a new Expansion-Lite kind of system to see if they can achieve their original vision that they had back in 2012, which was free Living world updates only, but they realized it wasn't enough so they eventually made expacs. But what I feel like the Saga format actually is, is kind of an hybrid system between and actual expac and living world updates, combining both system to make the format they originally planned more "viable", The prologue being a pretty good example of the potential length that these could have.  
---
at least that's how I see it
---
Thanks for the reply and honestly as a mesmer main I like the changes to chronomancer and what they did before for phantasms. I like active play, not just getting 3 phantasms and spamming auto attack between other CDs. I also like the shatter changes because elites were originally billed as being a change in how to play an old class instead of just a flat out bonus (like Mirage is rn) but I understand some people don't like them.
---
And I'm sorry but Scourge needed to be brought in line. It was too powerful in competitive modes. Big persistent AoE circles in a game mode focused around standing inside little circles was not a good design choice when if you tried to just take out the necro they could just spam tons of condi in a big radius around them. OP shit like that needs to be brought in line because this game has had too much powercreep since HoT.
---
I personally love it, keep it up! :)
---
I case you can't tell I'm talking about the random person that fell out of the sky

Not true:

---
\&gt; But there is a legitimate argument that the first episode of this SAGA  (which should have MORE features then season episodes) has equal amount  of content as the "worst" release of S4 - Long Live the Lich.
---
They never said each episode would have more content, but rather that they'd be releasing content and features not just during the "bigger" episode drops, but also in between with smaller feature patches. They have done that... doesn't mean that players have/haven't enjoyed what's come so far, but much of what you talk about is largely subjective. Of course new masteries are only usable in the saga. With the exception of mount and glider masteries, they'd have to completely limit what they are able to create for masteries if it has to be usable in all content, new or old.,
---
God forbid fictional characters actually be attractive. Someone call the morality police.
---
It is a nice wee system any chance it could be used outside of Icebrood like for festivals or current events.
---
I think we need to wait for the SM version of the boneskinner before we make judgments. The Open World will always have limits of it having to be accessible for all players, not just vets. The new Strike Mission so far has been amazing and I can't wait to see what they do with the Svanir boss and the Boneskinner boss.
---
I've been saying this for years and getting the same response. Thankfully,  it seems the majority of the playerbase does agree with me finally
---
Now all I can think of is the Broodmother from Dragon Age... man if only ANet had the balls to go THAT level of creepy.
---
Ohh makes sense
---
I was sort of disappointed as well, not seeing the thing as a part of the story at all. And after all that hype! Even the Boneskinner tonics and minis I saw at the vendor before venturing out deeper into the story made me think this guy is going to be a *big* deal. I absolutely could not wait to walk in that quiet, eerie dark forest knowing *that* thing is watching my every step. Honestly, without all the talk and the hype I would have considered it a normal group-event boss just like anything else (albeit very unique-looking) and not think about it twice.
---
I'm still kinda hoping it will be included in the future story as Jormag's creepy-ass lieutenant or something, but given the fact that they are actually originally Kodans  and there are/can be several of them instead of it being a unique creature, I don't really see it happening. And it wouldn't feel the same anyway.
---
Sooooo...I haven’t played in a while and I guess now isn’t the time to come back?

---
&gt;Finding enjoyment in the distress of others is an asshole move. 
---
I take no enjoyment in the distress of others. What would give you that idea?
---
&gt;This game is more than just open world, and it needs emergent gameplay mechanics in order to maintain replayability.
---
And yet most GW2 players do not engage in those "emergent mechanics" at all, so how could that be true? *Some* people enjoy those modes, just not many, and it is better to employ resources to improve the portions of the game that most people play than to continue throwing good money after bad trying to make fetch happen. Fetch isn't going to happen.

---
If I had any confidence in my own ability I'd offer to run with you and help but as stated I'm very new and learning these things intuitively. The only advice I can offer is to try to focus on your own performance and maximize your individual impact to the match. Personally, I even enjoyed losing when the match was close. Shutouts aren't fun obviously, and I had one match where I legit felt like it was me vs other team. In one game, we lost all three points initially and could retake them. I rushed across the field and disabled the enemy Treb, then died and mounted our own Treb. Even with that advantage, my team wasn't fighting on the points so I could effectively use the Treb. Eventually the enemy team got bored and rushed our Treb for sport. I actually managed to score a rampage on them and topped out Damage and Kills for my team for the match. Idk how I could man a Treb ineffectively for 3 minutes and still manage to top out Dmg and Kills in the last 60 seconds of the match. But with random ques, you're going to get potatoes eventually.
---
it should give the sense of Game of Throne ss8 when  White Walker attacked Winterfell. But in this case, it's too easy and has 0 excitement. 
---
Anet's too scared to create any difficult things in this game, what a waste potential.
---
It's... not that I "like the thing a lot and wanted more of it". Nor is it "just filler". Developer quotes from the Icebrood Saga announcement stream describing the Boneskinner and what we should expect:
---
"So not only in his model, but also in his game mechanics as well and then in episode one, back to Lovecraftian horror that you were speaking to Jason, we're going to introduce this thing called a "boneskinner" and this thing is terrifying. It's going to haunt you. It's going to set traps, it's going to ambush you, it's going to throw it's voice to trick you. It is going to be a force of nature in this map so you're going to be constantly looking over your shoulder to see where this thing is."
---
Source: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
The *developers* said that the Boneskinner would be more prevalent than it is. The *developers* set my expectations. The *developers* failed to meet it. At no point did the developers say "It's just a random dragon minion that has no impact."
---
Super secret hidden jumping puzzle.
---
What are you, 5? Clearly what they promised is either in the strike or nowhere to be found.
---
You know what else the devs didnt deliver on? 
---
Build templates for starters. That they charged up to 9 USD per character. Also theres no new raids. Theres no new fractals. Theres no Swiss. Theres no alliances...
---
Yeah bro, it was clear they were just smoking some good shit and let their imagination fly....
---
I mean... Throw it's voice to trick You? You know it's a top down rpg not a 1st person game right? You could tell that wasnt gonna happen the moment you read it. Unless it has a skill called like that?
---
Sets traps? Yeah sure, just like a dragonhunter. Ambushes? Yeah sure, the thing teleports. You had wildly unrealistic expectations friend!
---
That's because saying cool ideas and actually making them are wildly different processes. "Easier said than done" applies well here.
---
But does she deserve this?
---
Thanks! I will definitely give it a read.
---
I like all these people constantly protesting that it's free content and we should shut up and be happy about it. Free for them, maybe. Where do these people think the money to develop these things comes from in a FTP game? Whales, dude. It comes from people like me who actually drop significant chunks of cash into the game because we're enjoying it and want to see more.
---
This content wasn't free, it was just paid for by other people who weren't you.
---
I liked a lot of the mechanics in this expansion, and the map was gorgeous. But the sudden horror slant on the storytelling was legit the first moment I've had since picking up the game years ago where I just went, "ugh, these guys don't get another dime from me until this changes." I know I'm probably a minority opinion on that, and I'm not giving up on the game because it's genuinely my favorite MMO and I want it to keep going for years. But I really, deeply hope this entire saga is not horror themed. It just does nothing for me. I play games to relax, and GW2 has always been the fun/heroic/science fantasy/chill game I could enjoy with friends and my guild.
---
I don't want to make horrible choices or do evil things to NPC's like The Hunger achievement with no option to save them, I don't care about the constant Enya whispers in my ear that are going to be annoying as hell the 400th time I hear them, and as others have said, this all feels like the dev team played too much Witcher 3 before making it. I'm not saying there isn't a market for the horror genre, there definitely is, but I don't think GW2's core audience is going to embrace it like Anet is hoping.
---
When turning the sound off entirely makes the map less annoying, there's a problem there. When it's day 3 of the content being out and I'm completely turned off playing any further with it, that's another big problem. When it makes me stop dropping money on the game for the first time in years... I mean, I dunno, maybe this is the best thing ever and Anet will make tons of money and release more stuff with it and I'm just a moron that hates horror games. :P Totally possible.
---
My first blob got wiped but my 2nd got trough super easily, I guess it's cause we had a druid and the boss just don't do enough damage to get trough minimal heals, I was barely dodging prioritizing my rotation since I was taking so little damage..
---
Depends on what you normally play/how long ago you stopped! Honestly, this reddit is a toxic cesspool, so form your own opinion about the game first. Shit's started because veterans are angry at the lack of hardcore content, but if you aren't into those or you haven't touched any of the expansions, you'll never run out of things to do for a long time.
---
That was probably better than salvaging it
---
Can confirm, one healer make the fight a farce, you can ignore AoE and just go ham.
---
Though my first group without one got wiped mid way through.

---
I mean you might be right, but it kills any interest I had on taking the game seriously outside of the LW updates
---
You're right. This mob is anti-consumer. Someone call Jim Sterling!
---
I think it was sort of middle of the road, to be honest. They did a good job of having it popping up around ambiently but the fight is really anticlimactic. Hell, I don't even think thematically it should be a thing we CAN fight if we're going for the creepy eldritch horror vibe in this season. I'd love to have a thing out there that doesn't just walk over an die for us. It's not about wanting GW2 to be a horror game, I just think that, as a one-off, would be a cool idea. Just like I'd like to see us do more things that SEEM good but end up being bad (for example, the kodan achievement in this release would have been so much better for me if we realize at the end that he's STILL a monster and we realize we've actually been helping him fall deeper into madness).
---
And to some of your other points, I do kind of like the idea of IBS as a whole shutting down our mounts. I love the idea of Jormag's power being so great that the weather is too much for even just the flying mounts (icing up the wings ,etc.). I don't want people to be miserable, but I do miss some things that mounts take away from epic environments like a proper sense of scale and the ability to pack a lot of small details into an area.
---
Damn, I've just been opening all the dyes and adding to my collection. Didn't realise they could be sold.
---
Also I have added a bunch of cosmetics to collections (?) to make room in my inventory, how do I access these on my low level guy?
---
abandoned because there's no map tiles in the api after vabbi
---
Love it, imo the whole achievements (including collection) system is such a neat way of delivering - and logging - quests, way superior to any other quest-tracking system Ive seen so far in other MMORPGs.
---
With the tiered rewards the achievements - and therefore quests - dont have to broken up into smaller parts anymore, which is better for immersion.
---
What Id love even more, would be repeatable reward-achievements like the dungeoneering achievement for all endcontent.
---
So what's the point of the bombers
---
I was gunna say Rox is the least popular but I forgot she's not really a character lol
---
 I just wanted to draw some fanart for the new episode \^\^ Features my Sylvari berserker and the Primal Spirit Jackal skin.
---
[\[ArtStation Post\]](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9e0eZa)
---
Drawn on ProCreate on the iPad.
---
God I wish the Primal Spirit actually looked like that. The horns are a bit much atm. I wish they'd tone it down to be a more realistic antler.
---
I appreciate this, but... could you make it so that people can't *stand* on her? That was... a bit frustrating.
---
About GW2 playerbase, there's nothing to fear in PvE since the game uses a megaserver system. You'll be playing with people from everywhere in the world.
---
You could try joining a newbie guild. There are some that help newer players (though I can't check which now).
---
Basic crafting (Weaponsmith, Armorsmith, Huntsman, Leatherworker, Artificer and Tailor) is really simple:
---
* Refine raw materials 
---
* Make item components (usually 2 different components and a insignia for armors or inscription for weapons) 
---
* Join them together in discovery of you never did the item before, or select from your known recipes.
---
Most of the information on crafting - and in general as well - can be checked in the official wiki. You can find almost everything there: locations, map information, quests, story, characters, monsters, equipment, mechanics, crafting recipes and much more. 
---
As for efficiency, don't worry too much about it. Find a playstyle you like (which is may be different from the best). Open World leveling is for trying out. Ditch your Necromancer minions, go full close-range with Ranger, use a main element with Elementalist. Experiment with the classes.
---
As you seem to point talking about Thief, it seems like you prefer either a more supportive/tankier role, instead of full DPS. You did well in choosing Guardian, it can do a bit of all this. Ranger can as well, but it seems you're feeling too safe with it. I think Warrior, as cliché as you might think, also has this mixed role with banners.
---
Did you ?
---
Awesome job!
---
From the minimal it looks like you are almost directly underneath the DR hangout area where a bunch of people afk flex, dance, transform into quaggans, or muck around. Every now and then someone might jump off for some reason. Once I jumped off because someone insulted my armor dyes and I was pretending to suicide.
---
GET ON THE POINTS!!!!
---
A photo with a play/pause button...
---
I might simply have expected too much. :)
---
In the early days - when I still ran around collecting all the Ambrite weapons - you were lucky to get a T4 map and I think it was due to optimized routes not being well known yet. With the release of HoT and build-your-own-legendaries T6 finally became commonplace. I'm really happy to hear people still do that and it may be that Dry Top has become much better over time - but (again, to me) on release it felt a bit of a letdown. Still, the "Great. I'm a unit of measurement" dialogue was a comedic high point! :)
---
It will.
---
dialogue important for any game? Except online shooters, puzzle games, sport games, most simulator games and so on.
---
Yeah, you took a single line out of 20 and pulled it out of the context of the image that it is in. Then tried to say that those few words out of the whole thing is what the whole thing is about lmao. If you have to zoom in on one little part of the image and crop everything else out, it's probably not the point that the whole thing was about.
---
By that logic my last comment is about the launcher post, because you can quote "the launcher post" out of it without context. Therefore, that is what my comment is about. 
---
Clearly this post is about buying gems:

I mean, there's clearly no context that those snippets are taken from. It couldn't be that those are just elements of a whole that is making a separate point. Nahhhhh. I showed cropped images. That means those are what it is about.
---
Maybe instead of trying to dishonestly cherrypick little pieces, we should look at the [https://imgur.com/bmfwHfJ](https://imgur.com/bmfwHfJ)

You CANNOT sell the dyes you get from birthday dye packs. They're just saying to look and find the most expensive and choose that one. You can use the wiki or something like Immortius' wardrobe unlock analyzer.
---
Now I have to rewatch the video. Again.
---
Taco can probably do everything it does but better tbh
---
Where may I acquire this fine pitchfork of the human? Would definitely assist me well in my rioting endaevours.
---
Even if you were exaggerating and saying you beat the whole thing in 20 minutes, that means you're drinking your beer slow lol. 
---
People around here exaggerate that episodes are "only an hour of content". If you didn't finish your beer in even half that time, that just means you need to drink faster... I've finished playing 3 episodes in a row before finishing my coffee before. Sure it was cold by the time I was done, but I still hadn't finished it!!!
---
So even if you log off and come back it forces you back in the strike mission? What if you switch to a different character and back?
---
taco has grown over time, especially with the recent addition of markers appearing on the map and minimap.
---
taco does require marker packs to be downloaded, however, while gw2timer already has all of the information ready to go for the user. and in browser format.
---
Thank you! That actually was what I had in mind when I drew it! GW2's art has always been a big inspiration to me growing up, so I'm happy to hear that my art is able to capture the spirit of the official artwork. ^^
---
That's normal for a game which doesn't get updates yes, but for games which are getting good updates you should be seeing a rise in numbers and sub activity. See the Destiny 2, WoW and FF14 subs.
---
Well it doesn't have all the information judging by OPs post lol
---
i use the navi, too. its really useful, especially for getting waypoint links. its a straight MVP when doing guild missions. also the custom checklists and notepad is great, too.
---
i was able to continue making 2D maps for players who don't use addons by using the new minimap marker display on taco, but i still like how gw2timer makes all the information readily available to players without having to download any addons or feature packs.
---
Pray tell, why would you think it would be sarcasm?
---
Yes, I don't like the idea of the removal.
---
I liked the possibility to glide high above a group of enemies and then fall in the middle of them, launching them all just before greeting them with a whirlwind-axe. I#m not sure how much of this feature is left now, but it generally feels like some kind of 'power' is missing when gliding down.
---
It's like James Bond using seat belts.
---
Hot damn
---
Feels like something Anet would put out themselves
---
I recently started dabbling in pvp also after never considering it, you know what?
---
I loved it too and I’ve had good games and bad games but mostly good, I ran into a duo who were harassing me the other day and I was against them 3 games in a row and I nearly cried xd 
---
But then they invited me to their team and discord and we’ve been doing all sorts together since pvp and pve alike
---
If they are talking about it, it means they are gearing the community to expect it. There is no way that they would say "hey guys, we are going to give you less maps" unless they were preemptively setting expectations. They would say nothing otherwise. 
---
Anet struggling with their own approach is not really the community's responsibility. A lot of their content issues were how content was presented anyway, it was not designed to be replayable, again, not the community's fault. 
---
I never said you didn't have a right to your opinion, I am stating that dismissing the values of others because they do (which is what you were doing) is wrong. 
---
I am actually anti grind myself, or rather I am anti equipment/gold grind. However that has nothing to do with anything I said.
---
Reddit should let me pay an equivalent amount of money to take gold away from gilded posts. Mega-upvote needs a mega-downvote.

---
All of the HoT elite spec collections require you to get the corresponding Mystic weapon and to craft any of them you need 1 Eldricht Scroll, 5 times the 2 components usually needed to craft that kind of weapon in exotic and 30 Mystic Coins. The MCs are where the bulk of the price is (it's like 34-36g out for 36-38g total) and this is the case for all HoT elite weapons unfortunately.
---
In comparison PoF collections require you to get a specific Named exotic weapon that you can get from identifying unid gear and while they were pricey at the start of PoF (look at the [graph at the bottom for the Sword](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/82115-Libehs-Truthteller)) their price have started to fall quite a lot because supply increased while demand lowered progressively.
---
Those exotics are not used for any other collection or anything. For HoT the price is tied to the price of MCs which is used in a looot of other places and has a rather low-ish supply for its demand. So it's more HoT collections in general that are pricey that Tempest in particular.
---
Are they? Are there any worthwhile drops for the new strike mission? The first clear of each raid counter per week gives 2g straight up (in addition to the few unids, the decent karma, the chance of ascended drops, etc.).
---
That fact that this is the solution is abysmal design.
---
&gt; The problem is when players […] play off in Narnia with lone-wolf mentalities and die alone in an inconvenient revival location

Sooo bear bows?
---
It might be a controversial thing to say on this sub, but GW2's story is garbage and always has been. Sure it has some good moments here and there, like this episode, but overall it's pretty bad.
---
Every time someone praises the story I think they're just caught up in how good one specific moment was (compared to the rest of GW2's story), or have just never played the many games with fantastic stories (which is quite sad if they like interactive storytelling so much).
---
The red circles don't do any damage at all. They just immobilize. Once I realized this, I just happily stand in them as long as I'm in melee range of the boss.

---
&gt; People spent a lot of time asking for more non-human flavour to be added to the game
---
Just a pity they **still** fall back on "trials" as their excuse for non-combat/quirky combat content. Just when I hoped we had finally rid ourselves of Glint and her obsession of testing everyone three times every little step along the way.
---
Couldn't they at least have made it 2 or 4 side chambers instead of this near-linear "maze" that feels like a FNAF reskin of Glint's Lair?
---
Will that be implemented in older achievements as well?
---
There are several big and long running ones that are not *up to date* and do have several unrewarding steps.
---
Not all need it, if course, but it would be nice to see these getting weaved into older ones, making them more valuable, as well as motivating for players to do.
---
Maybe introducing new ones (like a tiered for the slayer achievements. Oh you completed 2, 4, 6 of these, have something cool)
---
grothmar wardowns sounds way cooler than grothmar valley tbh. are you playing in another language, by chance?
---
I'm talking about Huntsman 500 to Craft Zojja's Ascended Warhorn, not Mystic Caller. I want to have 500 in every discipline anyway.
---
If you do not notice where the dishonestly is, then you do not quite understand my comment.
---
Like I said in another comment, I have 0 legendaries, but the fact that making one is an option for me if I choose so enriches the release.
---
1 Do you actually think the chunks we're getting of this map are at all comparable to the tiny chunks of Dry Top's expansion...? Of course these will take longer than those.
---
2 They said current season will be more like 2 months per release. Last release to this release was 2 months almost to the day.
---
When I first glanced at this post, I read ‘testicles’ instead of ‘tactics’.
---
I would say to go for the Mystic Caller anyway, Huntsman 400-500 is 60g which is already more expensive than the Mystic Caller and you need to add around 35-40g of materials (same price as the Mystic Caller and you don't get the new skin). So for your first one probably not worth going for crafting when other methods exist.
---
If you have some currencies around (like from Fractals relics and pages in the future it is usually more interesting to use [Grandmaster's marks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Huntsman%27s_Mark) to get weapons that directly crafting them as can be seen [on this price table](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Weapon_crafting_and_vending).
---
Mythic plus, raids, and dailies are the definition of replayable...
---
Ehh there are so many ways to ppt in PvP.
---
You can also do the 3man rush... (2 near 3 far)
---
Gives up center (but they lose at far so you take it with 3v1 basically instantly)
---
Home is a 2v1 and you immediately win that node as well
---
So it send their 3-4 man mid group to an empty space which forces them to recommit OR to split which causes undue confusion while they decide who goes where to defend what.
---
Then you just roam every node 2man groups. Pvp is about back up and even if you are a 1v1 god you are wasting time if you don’t kill in 10-20sec. So pvp is a +1 to the party thing so you get fast kills. (I.e rarely if ever go off alone..)
---
We did it a lot in early rounds of AT/mAT.. you won’t catch real teams that way but random/pug teams can’t cope with team tactics.
---
Oh Welcome and enjoy your ascension!! (With this level of enthusiasm and “fun” it’s a done deal you’ll get it easy)
---
Lol you played Randomway and get what you deserve.
---
Real pvp in this game is NOT ranked (randomway) it’s the Automated Tournament and the Monthly.
---
That’s real pvp the rest is pve pip farmers (randomway can be great fun but it’s not organized pvp lol)
---
For tournament you need real pvp tools like ts3/discord and some understanding of team comps and strategy.
---
You will enjoy the real pvp but it’s a very steep learning curve
---
Everyone has 70-80% winrate and loves PvP until they don't.
---
Thet hardly take time and can give the shoulders and shit. Raids on the other hand only give the gold and maybe a doubloon from qadim/largos/sabir which is honestly so damn rare that ive seen it once.
---
Presumably, episode 2 will release between Wintersday and Lunar New Year. Based on the last couple years, there's about 3 weeks between those two.
---
Plus, releases *can* overlap with festivals. They've done it before at least.
---
Ok, I might get this totally wrong, but why is nobody talking about the wording Jormag used in the final cutscene?
---
He said that the danger is "just on the horizon". I know that the word "horizon" can be used in any context, but it is often used in open seas and oceans. So was he really saying "the danger is on the horizon" meaning "the danger will come from the horizon, from the sea"?
---
I interpreted that as clear evidence of Deep Sea Dragon being the "danger" Jormag was talking about. Or did I totally missed the point?
---
You are committed to the game but you don't want to leave. Take a break, experience something new and return when you'll understand that gw2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other mmos
---
EXACTLY THIS. Every damn time, after all these years, when I see one of those furry fucks I feel the urge to go to Divinity's Reach and Ebonhawk, group together an army and take back our Ascalon from them. Can't believe we're fighting some stupid dragons instead of them.
---

---
Where are you getting "4 months" from? They said it's every 2 months, and they hit that almost to the day between Bound By Blood and Whisper in the Dark.
---
Oh well that's cool, thanks I will check it out. The point overall stands though, one jumping puzzle in the last 8 living story maps. Clearly it has been getting sacrificed.
---
No ***I'm*** Dirty Dan!
---
Can you link a source to that statement? I've only heard them say that we will get half the map in episode 1 and half the map in episode 2 (in 2 months).
---
Stop complaining its only the 2nd episode
---
Oh but of course, like nearly everywhere you can go around and walk instead of jumping. But VB is designed in 3D, it has more than any other maps, without going into canopy (which afaik is not possible without gliding, even the non-chopper ways require either updraft of mushroom, the latter being locked behind gliding). When going around as a new player (or new account in my case), you easily want to jump down in a few places.
---
reading is hard
---
The people who are the most agitated are harder core players. It's a good game for casual players and always has been. I've been playing for seven years, pretty much without a break. I still get everything I want to done. The only thing in the game I don't do at all is raid.
---
To be quite frank with you, I stopped giving a shit about gw2s story a long time ago. I love some ideas, I love some parts of it, but overall... nope. That is part one. Part two is that I'll also admit it was an oversimplified thought, because this is reddit and not a university - and I don't even study anything remotely close to storytelling, I just read a lot of stories. But as simplified as the thought is, I don't want to see it interpreted as anti-SJW or anti-PC culture or bullshit like that.
---
Here is my main argument:
---
- The game is PG-13. Why? To sell more, probably. But that also means some things cant be depicted or explored or need to be dumbed down. 
---
- The game needs to be marketable. That means it needs to be as non-confrontational as possible. (compare that to magic - the gathering; their writers have openly stated no character of theirs can have a personality the company does not endorse. No racists, murderers, idiots, ...?)
---
- The people working at gw2, especially in the art and story department, don't strike me as people who want to tackle issues by exploring them.
---
The last point is probably the most important. They have a holier than thou attitude than just talks down to people with a different attitude. They don't engage in dialogue - so why would their characters? They also think depiction is representation, so why would they depict characters with problematic attitudes? That actively prevents them from destroying said characters and exposing their flawed logic. My head hurts explaining the following, because I'm not a native speaker and I usually don't do this (because it feels like a waste of time, nobody listens), so pls bear with me and be cooperative to work out the central points with meand don't pick it apart too much.
---
Let me give you an example:
---
In your story, you want to talk about racism. Here is how gw2 would do it, and why: 
---
They show you a faction. This faction is racist. You go and beat them up. You have now won the rights to call them idiots because you are stronger than them.
---
Here is how a sensible story tackles the problem:
---
They show you a person, this person is nice to you. You gain good stuff and an easier life because of this. You notice that this person is not as nice to others and figure out why: They don't share your skin color or culture. Do you say something and risk your privileged position or your life, or do you not care? What if it turns out (later?) the persons discriminated against are really criminals? What if they are morally ambiguous (rebels, for example?). 
---
A more sensible story would engage in this and would solve this via dialogue. The ideals would clash in dialogue and in action, and just because one party wins one or both... does that proof their superior morality? Or just their rhetoric or physical prowess?
---
GW2 writers can't have racists be actually dangerous, because they think that would represent them and give their ideas power. It would somehow *proof them right*.
---
And that's why imho they fail so terribly as story tellers. In reality, some ideologies are precisely so dangerous because those who uphold them *are* powerful. And the challenge is to oppose them still, in words and actions. And that is simply not the ground anet workers tread on, they surround themselves with people of their own opinion and suppress problematic ideas instead of engaging them. They fight these ideas by building a wall around themselves and letting only people in who proof that they have the same mindset. Their idea of "clashing ideas" is a one-sided beatdown of moral, rhetorical and physical superiority with a huge supporting cast behind them. And here is where you absolutely must not get me wrong: I can totally understand why they do it and I don't want this interpreted as "you, Spike, are an incel and hate sjw culture". No, I understand them. The world is full of shit and it is absolutely your right to have your safe space in which you want to have nothing to do with all that bullshit.
---
#But.
---
They reflect that safe space onto their games. And it shows in the dialogue. It is devoid of conflict. And if they write conflict (Braham leaving the party? Joko being a dictator?), it is awkward because anet cant really write them as characters who really hold their own opinion if that opinion is not one anet holds itself. 
---
They can not go into the mindset of those people, because for them it would mean they represent those people and fight for that mindset, or that they somehow endorse it. That's why their stories and dialogue fail so much. Either their characters all have the same opinion and whine together about an outside force (Asura Council, Flame Legion, Nightmare Court, ...) that is terribly explored because of a lack of empathy for morally wrong ideologies (again, not that they should think they are okay, but understand why characters have them!!). Or they just overcome that without any problems. Or both.
---
Same goes for dialogue. There is no conflict. 
---
Conflict would mean both parties in a dialogue stand behind their ideals. Resolving that conflict may or may not happen in many ways.
---
But anet cant resolve anything. There is nothing to resolve because there is no conflict. Because they don't write genuine characters convinced of their own ideals.
---
I hope I got my message across. I really don't know how to put this into words. I feel like I lack something here, some expression or thought to get my point across the finish line.
---
It's just... this shit shows every time we have an antagonist. Every time there is "conflict" it isn't real. Nothing is at stake and "good" can't triumph over "evil", because there isn't any "evil". There can't be, because anet would think they'd be representing "evil" and therefore giving power to those ideas. Instead of showing and dismantling them.
---
I wouldn't say that it's *inherently* better, but I prefer it if it is delivered well. 
---
My hope is that this means we get fewer maps, but each map gets more attention, polish, and playtime, since the next release will still be part of the same map. It makes a map more meaningful when it isn't just one and done and we're off to a new map straight away.
---
Now, this is just my hope of a best case scenario. So we'll have to wait to see if things work out that way in practice.
---
DED GAEM
---
Interesting. Did you consider phasing for that cave?
---
So not worth playing, I might login play the saga then leave again
---
This is a common thing I keep seeing people mention, but it stems from the incorrect assumption that "prologue" has anything to do with length. A prologue just means a leading setup/introduction section to a story that isn't directly part of the main story arc. The prologue of a book can be just as long as any other chapter in that book. For example the prologue section in the first LotR movie is like 8 minutes long before the story really starts in the shire. 
---
Everyone jumped on the term "prologue" and kept incorrectly assuming and stating that that implies "small/smaller than a normal episode", which it doesn't. People were always saying things like "and this is *just* the *prologue*" about Bound by Blood. I kept trying to correct that every time someone said it to keep people from inflating expectations, but it seems like a LOT of people held that misconception.
---
I've played for years and been on a break after POF the new saga seems to get alot of negative views but was hoping the player base would increase after, seems not :/
---
blue name = party therefore not a random person
---
who are you trying to fool here?
---
If you're hinting at the "kill 1000 Achieves" in Dragonfall I guess all my concern would be dissolved by counting eventmobs.
---
Tbh, as a former AP-Hunter it's enough for me to hear the jingle of completing a tier. I've been conditioned to that for too long now ._.
---
I didn't expect the prologue to be shorter than episode 1, but i did expect them to be of roughly the same length
---
Well you did better than me. I think I lost the first 20 pvp matches I played. Over 4k games later though I am still playing. It is still a load of fun to me.
---
I thought of a sloth, but he hedgehog works aswell.
---
when bob started last thursday this episode is still free.
---
tyvm for this easy one guide
---
not even close
---
People keep comparing it to the Witcher, but it sounds a lot like the Mordremoth battle music to me. 
---
Great music either way.
---
Imagine they would restructure to pvp and please the 3% :D
---
This game is for casual players who want to see a secound world in the evening, for them the basic story is enough.
---
100% correct it isn't close, GW2 is far far worse.
---
&gt; until you release new episode everyone will forget what actually happened.
---
not "everyone" has an attention span of a fruit fly.
---
&gt; And won't care anymore
---
stop speaking for everyone.
---
Casual players are busy and need new story once per week otherwise they will forget what happened.
---
Generally speaking, MMOs are not as good at stories over all as decent single player games. It's a lot harder to write a story when one person can't change the world in the first place. At the end of the day, the story is a vehicle to drive action. It gives characters purpose and motivation. It's not supposed to be Shakespeare.
---
That is the right choice.
---
hohoho, now you showed me!
---
ESOs shop still is worse. alone the fact that you have to sub every month to be a somewhat productive gatherer/crafter is a disgrace.
---
How do you define "normal" people :D ?
---
This, please.
---
Its not. He didnt BUY PoF and he cant access it, its locked behind a purchase. Stop spreading bullshit.
---
OK boomer.
---
I liked the story,  and am still enjoying the map.
---
Its nice to see Anet is moving away from frustratingly long instances.
---
I agree, story is better in witcher, also in dragon age. But why so angry?
---
You also see a black-geen ray from the center of the ritual to your character, just run around until the clone spawns, then you can complete the event.
---
Not true at all for fractals.  Raids are dead ( tx to the seven Gods) and let's hope they will be changed in strikes soon ( single strike for each boss would be perfect).
---
There are lots of players. If I do not raid game is still amazing
---
I would like to remind you that most popular online games are pvp oriented...
---
People that spend 1-2 hours daily or every 2 days in it. As someone who wants to play something for 5-6 hours daily, you might get bored.
---
SWTOR exceeds a lot of single player games in the story department and ESO has one that is good for an MMO and better than some singleplayer games, not a lot but some, it plays it very safe.
---
That response does not work any more and is actually just sad.
---
No. Once per week ? Do you have a work? A family ?  Once epr 2 months sometimes is barely bearable.
---
Take it easy
---
Sure and it's a WoW clone with a single player story tacked onto it that doesn't change the world at all. When I play Skyrim my choices change the world. SWToR is really two games, a story and WoW in the Star Wars Universe. That's why my post said generally speaking. Doesn't change a word I've said.
---
&gt; Plus who cares about LNY? It's easily the lamest festival imo.
---
It's one of the most profitable.  Made over 15k gold last year lol
---
If we apply that same argument to GW2, the story doesn't change the world either, it's just worse than a lot of mmo stories in the writing department. I agree, SWTOR is great to play as a story only game, just as GW2 is great to play for open world and not much else
---
Right but I didn't say Guild Wars 2 did I said Sky Rim did. It's one of the reasons MMO stories will always be weaker than single player games at least potentially, that's my point.  You can't change a world everyone is playing in.
---
nobody wants to work on a dead game get used to it this company will become using only new graduated developers and they will leave too after they get some experience.
---
It basically \_is\_ a variation of a wendigo really. It has a wendigo story and looks.
---
Not that I'm complaining. I like wendigo folklore. :D
---
But none of the examples you provided are mmos, mmos are more then pvp.
---
*Doubt*
---
Thats your oppionion and i respect it, but most people don't play to "adapt and improve", they play to have fun.
---
It's the games job to make people grow as a player, and the game does a REALLY bad job at that.
---
I played a lot of aion and this simply didnt happen. Also you didnt do 20% of a meta build DPS just because you didnt have bis gear or didnt do a perfect rotation...
---
Dying is a different concept than the maxmium number of players. Dying is a process. It means the player base goes towards a critical minimum. That minimum can be far away from the maximum.
---
In other words: just because one genre has a high player number than others (which, one always has), the others aren't dying. There is room for a lot of different genres. You also wouldn't claim just because crime novels have a higher number of readers, romance novels are dying out (which might also be the other way around, but that wouldn't matter for the argument).
---
Is any of the titles you wrote an mmo?
---
Exactly, pvp is fun if you don't take it too seriously. Once you start trying to be competitive the flaws/balancing issues start rearing their head.
---
You'll also find similar music in GW2 from years ago. It sounds a lot like the Mordremoth battle music. The Witcher didn't invent that style of music lol. And to be honest, the models aren't really very similar at all aside from the fact that they both have deer-like skull shapes. Which is hardly unique to the Witcher as far as monster design goes lol (not to say that's a knock on the Witcher, I love that game too). If they didn't both have a deer-shaped skull, you wouldn't even be comparing the two. 
---
The Boneskinner is a wendigo. The Leshen is a bipedal forest spirit made of wood with a humanoid body and tree branch hands. The Boneskinner is a skeletal quadruped monster born from cannibalism, with muscle tissue and bones sticking out, a more animal body, and clawed feet...
---
I mean, honestly when you look at them side by side they're not really close, let alone "literally the same". Even the heads are very different. The Boneskinner has a large head with sharp teeth, a big mouth, glowing eyes, and big thick horn-like antlers. While the Lesher has a small head with deer antlers, no eyes, no teeth, and not even a bottom jaw. 
---
The Leshen is closer to a big male Skyrim sprigan with a deer skull. The Boneskinner is basically a wendigo from folklore, both in look and story. I mean you can even just google image search "wendigo" and get a bunch of stuff that looks just like the Boneskinner lol.
---
Nah, its cooler to not make false praise for a shitty game
---
How could a genre "move on" towards a different genre?
---
Why would *we* be able to go where mounts can't? Makes little sense...
---
Btw we know how to make thaw elixirs...
---
Like, again... Noone forces you to mount. You can totally 100% play without riding; you just don't want to and pretend you would enjoy it if the game forced you too.
---
Thing is, i paid a lot of gold and gems for my mounts... Why? Because i seriously enjoy them a lot, and it feels lame not being able to ride.
---
With my solution we can both be happy (i'll just go with my skyscale why you walk), while your solution makes you happy and screws me over. I seriously don't understand what's the upside of forcing *me* to walk. Noone forces you to ride.
---
arena net is funny example. When pve was a thing arena net was focusing on pvp (guild wars 1). When pvp is a thing (fortine, apex, league ... ) arena net is focusing on pve which is dying. 200 iq.
---
You compare different genres (BR, MOBA, FPS; all listed exclusively PvP) with another genre (MMO**RPG**, which is almost always more PvE oriented, at the same time all offer PvP mode, but not exclusively). Doesn't make sense.
---
Of course casuals are a majority of the game when anet has made sure that everyone who cares about any challenging or competitive content left the game.
---
Sorry, we forgot everyone has 10 families and 15 jobs and plays 30 minutes per month
---
For any given difficulty, there exists a subset of gw2 players that will wipe repeatedly.
---
Do these give the same raid rewards? As a pretty casual player I never got into the raids properly and wouldn't mind getting some of the gear still
---
I would suggest making the achievement requirement items account bound. Being able to buy Boreal weapons off of TP allows one to fast-track the achievements
---
if you mean the puzzle in southern mountains, the starting shrine is waaaay up on one of the highest hills. there already is a vid on youtube https://youtu.be/nzBQOISKIpQ
---
Oh well, I mixed up then
---
Your artwork is stunning! And I have a Sylvati berserker too! :P
---
I want to get the Primal Spirit skin but I already have Shrine Jackal so I'm torn D:
---
Talking about family in times when people have less children (or not at all) than in the past. You must still live in 1900. Are you some kind of amish or what?
---
Does not matter, because gw2 players do not play pvp enough so the game shifted to pve without hard endgame.
---
Post this on the official forum so they can see it! ;)
---
WatchmenHBO eps was releasing once per 3/4 months?
---
It's amazing how he believes their story is good. Anyway, getting lectures from a company which kills Aurene in one episode, makes conference about how killing important characters impacts viewers and resurrects her at the beginning of next episode.
---
No thanks.
---
&gt;This kind of story (with 2h of content) should be released once per 2 weeks...
---
Imagine caring **only** about wvw. 
---
**652+ Days since the WvW Restructuring announcement. **
---
(number taken from a thread a couple weeks ago)
---
Yeah well I could make a bunch of money working the corner at night, but that doesn't mean I want to lol.
---
652+ Days since the WvW Restructuring announcement.
---
In that time, hard-core wvw people have left, server populations are dying.
---
Yikes
---
It’s really amazing that he chose put something out there like that.  He’s totally right, from a philosophical and moral point of view.  I don’t know if that philosophy applies very well to GW2, but it’s a great life lesson and it makes me glad that someone of good intention and intelligence is on the GW2 team.  
---
I wish him well in the flame war to come.
---
I'll use this topic to rehash some points. I've said it before and I'll say it again. It is not like Anet does everything wrong they just have the wrong priorities now. That also goes in contrast to how they used to develop GW2.
---
The game is an MMO. The #1 thing of importance is the world. You aim to make the maps good. It is not wrong to have a single player story but let the map have the bulk of the story and use the single-player missions to enhance the map. That is how GW2 was originally made but now they work in the opposite. They focus on the single-player missions and use the maps to enhance that. That doesn't work!
---
The same goes for the monetization. I think most of us players are aware that Anet needs to monetize their game somehow. Free games are never truly free as employees need salaries and companies need profit. The problem is that if you aim to be a computer game studio you should put your product first and monetization second. If you have a good product people will play and when they play investedly, there are many things you can sell to them to monetize your B2P model. If you put your gem store first and your game second, people will feel exploited and I believe that Anet are losing tons of money from sending that signal to their players.
---
It can be seen in the reversal between world/maps and instanced story. It can be seen in how they put more time into updating and talking about the store than they do into updating the game (just look at the news feed, it is more about the store than the game). It can be seen how they value items where the original game had legendaries at their top tier cosmetics but then there was a ton of recipes that has as nice- or nicer skins than the gem store as a second tier whereas the gem store items firmly rested on a third tier. Items like the Foefire weapons were, arguably, flashier than the gem store items and that gave people something to work towards that wasn't a full blown legendary. That provided content. That entire layer of content is gone now. There is only the odd legendary and the gem store now while the gem store items are leaps and bounds above whatever items are provided as specialist vendor or adventure weapons (just look at the store axe vs. Boreal with this patch). The boreal weapons are blue-green tier trash compared to the gem axe. I don't mind them selling the axe, I mind them betraying their vision and balance between game and gems.
---
If you look at any recent update that has drawn the ire of the community, these issues are being reproduced time and time again. Some people say that the community is unthankful or so unhappy with everything that they can not be pleased. I think that is a load of croak. It is bullshit. The community in this game is extremely loyal and patient given what it has to put up with. The reason they are unhappy is that they keep getting exploited over and over. The community has critisized the LW release model for these very reasons for quite a long time now. Most of LW s4 was met with critique of the replay value of the maps. The critique was already there with LW s3, just not as widespread. I'm pretty sure that's why Anet rebranded s5 a Saga. However, it is the same content in the same pakage with a different label. It isn't even a different pakage. If you assume that something like that will silence your mob of players, you only show that you think that your mob is stupid.
---
If the developer keeps exploiting their players and does things that suggests the players to be stupid, of course there will continue to be backlash.
---
If they stopped exploiting the community, got their priorities back on track (game over store, multiplayer content over single player content etc.) and stopped treating the community as stupid peasants, I'm pretty sure that they could win the players back and turn the finances back around. GW2 is still a game with potential in a market that isn't saturated with good MMO.
---
Straight up lies? Maybe you should wake up amd stop shilling. Build templates was the most wanted feature since the launch of the game and it cost over 350$ to unlock across all 9 characters. And about the new boring map, everyone is losing their mind over some whispers you get while playing. I couldn't care less if the plan to expand it, the point is that we waited 3 months for a 2h story and a absolutely boring af map with no replayability whatsoever. As for raids you can effectively find a grp only on Mondays evenings if you are lucky. Even on weekends it's hard to find any raid grp.
---
I dabbled with it around the launch of the game but hadn't touched it again until a couple of weeks ago. I kept hearing about how toxic the players could be and always assumed it was only the die-hard elitists left playing. One day I really didn't feel like doing most of the PvE dailies so I thought I'd try my luck with the PvP ones, and was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had. I'm still mostly sticking to 1-2 matches a day for dailies but it's good to know that I have something to fall back on when I need a break from other parts of the game.
---
It kind of depends on what you want to do in the future. Raids, Fractals, WvW. If you want to do a damage role you are good to go with berserker (For min maxing you will need some assassin's pieces: https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/)
---
If you wanna go for a support role a berserker/diviner mix would be good and should still do enough damage for open world stuff https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/. Note those are raid builds, but you can easily play them in Fractals however they aren't min maxed for it. If you want to go for WvW you might want a marauder/berserker mix so you have some sustainability.
---
Well, the game tried to make people grow as players, but said players refused to grow and instead complained about HoT's level of challenge. 
---
I do agree that there is quite a lot of information missing in the game, but in all honesty, it wouldn't change much (if at all), because as you say, people play for fun and the issue with that is that they define fun as a sightseeing tour. They literally can't be bothered to grow as players.
---
Thus, if players don't seek missing information for themselves outside the game, they likely wouldn't make use of that information even if it was presented ingame.
---
This is but a part of the ongoing war between those who play with passion because it is their hobby, and those who play to burn time. These two types of players don't fit together. That is a very rough, basic description as there are a lot more subgroups and overlaps inbetween them. But the verdict stays the same: one group ruins a game for another (this goes all ways, not just one direction), and one group ruins gaming as a whole for another (this goes only one way because capitalism, as one group sadly is muuuch bigger than the other).
---
Exactly. Game always had a lot of potential but Im afraid its too late. Too much players got enough after 7 years and they probably won't believe arena net anymore.
---
Then do the daily fractals like everyone else. You'll still level up
---
What do you mean, exploit? Aren't the AP you're getting by switching map the one you previously lost?
---
I guess I forgot where I said "Anet has great marketing". Can you link me a source on that?
---
I was referring to this
---
&gt;Look at their marketing, oh wait, there is none.
---
To which I responded by pointing out examples of marketing that exists. Which you acknowledge exists, so I think my point was made.
---
I believe you're the one that needs to be introduced to personalized ads, since you apparently don't know how they work... You wouldn't get served a GW2 ad only if you search for GW2 specifically. You'd get served it because you browse video games in general, or *maybe* as specific as just MMO's at the most focused. Hence why I get ads for guitars/guitar stores/guitar parts that I've never even heard of just because I search and browse guitar stuff in general. Same with games I've never heard of, movies I've never heard of, etc etc etc. What you said is just wrong.
---
If they were that hyper-focused in their ad targeting, you'd only be showing it to people that are already looking at it as you said. That would make the whole concept of personalized advertising completely pointless. It's like you not only don't know what you're talking about, but didn't even think that through before you said it.
---
I found it, too, I THINK it might be near where you get the book up there? (I found the book the first time, and this much later) It's toward the back middle, I think? You have to stand in EXACTLY the right spot to get the special action button to show
---
You can't deny Aurene's death was impactful both for the players and the characters. Even though we knew she would probably come back in one way or another it still hit most of the players very hard especially because of how they made us experience her death.
---
Aurene's death also contributed a lot to the character development of several NPCs especially those featured in the short stories between ep 5 and 6.
---
The fact they revived her next episode doesn't change any of this.
---
You get an extra level if you play a ractal above your level. When you are level 30 and want to get more, do the fractals 31-100.
---
&gt;Where are you getting "4 months" from? They said it's every 2 months, and they hit that almost to the day between Bound By Blood and Whisper in the Dark.
---
Every single other release they've ever made. Anet has massive trouble keeping a consistent scedule.
---
&gt;They said it's every 2 months,
---
They also said we'd get "expansion worthy content", but we're still waiting for that.
---
Even assuming next episode comes out in 2 months, if its as dry, minimal and barebones as this one (which, considering they said fractals and legendaries are shelved for now, it probably will) then it doesn't really do much good.
---
even as a casual it won't take long to gear three builds just doing daily fractals and some trinket gathering. if you spvp you can get the experience tomes to level a toon pretty fast. i just came back to the game after the chronomancer nerfs and i can say that fractals are easily doable as a dps chronomancer, even as a full on minstrels heal/support. not every pick up group is looking for the perfect setup and often what happens is your group will have a sup guardian but no rev so in those cases you can gear in zerker with ~3 pieces minstrel+ concentration food as a dps with decent utility and give alac and pull off big focus pulls. 
---
you can also gear an ascended minstrels or exotic givers chrono to tank for raids. i personally dont do wvw but i play spvp in platinum mainly as a mirage so i get a good mix of fractals, raids and pvp in different roles as a mesmer, which i enjoy.
---
Sorry, at work now. Will try to post when I get back home
---
First dulfy, now this. Whyyy....
---
Ye do stupid from me
---
The feature regardless of its issues (it has many and people have rightly criticized them) is completely free across your characters. Lying about features doesn't help anyone. I have no issues finding a raid group any day of the week so from my personal experience you can find a group ant day of the week. The story is largely person preference if we're being honest. Like I said in my comment I enjoyed it, but I do see why people might not enjoy the story/map. Resorting to lies and hyperbole helps no one here, it's fine if you have issues with the game and you should criticize anet for thier failings but honestly comments like these are just as bad as the ones claiming the game is perfectly fine and has no issues.
---
Have you been able to reproduce it afterwards?
---
Wow!  That’s beautiful!  And really captures the game style!
---
I absolutely love the colour composition! Hoping you'll share more of your art. :)
---
Nothing is getting fixed or changed. That is why people are angry. The game has turned terrible and Arenanet is dead silent. 
---
\&gt; is not an excuse to be nasty to the people themselves. 
---
I was not nasty to 'people themselves', this was targetted towards the company in whole. This is not attack on personal attack. 
---
Whiteknighting does nothing but let them continue on their path. Online game is already at its lowest point, we have to do something, even if that something is snarky reddit threads.
---
Since you don't have even a full trait line unlocked in chrono I would suggest just holding off on it, you could be getting 3 more major traits instead. For now I'd suggest running Illusions with something like 1 (or 2), 2, 1 for traits. Also you don't really need signet of inspiration for solo/open world play when you're not even giving out boons, I'd go for another skill to replace it like mantra of pain or even a more defensive option, up to you. Sword/sword + greatsword is good, having the option for a focus offhand is nice too to pull enemies together and provide a little more AoE. For now I wouldn't worry too much about gear, you can look into [builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) and [gearing guides](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) later but it seems like you're pretty much set for now though I would try to get a full rune set, even a cheap one is fine till you can decide what you're working to. The diviner gear you mentioned is specifically for boon builds (which chrono can do very well) but for open world and story you don't need to worry yet.
---
Yeeeeeeah. A lot of emotions... ZzZzz...
---
Hi Clayton! Is there a fix for the achivement "Ice-bound" soon? I can't finish my masteries because I'm missing that achivement that give mastery point :(
---
You cannot assume ppl have same life as seven years ago. If u spent seven years and still live live seven years ago with no additional issue in real life ... Well suppose we got different priorities.
---
Yes, I cam deny this. Aurene's death was meaningless. She was ressurected right after death, characters never had to deal with events without her. Just because some overly emotional crybabies were overwhelmed by this, it doesnt make her arc good. Aurene's resurrection wasnt earned in the story. Anet has bad writers.
---
Imagine world boss with raid mechanics with increasing difficutly with 10 man limit with no ress if I die
---
Only one member of your fractal party has to be "high level". Because that member can open any fractal then if their personal level is 100.
---
You gain one fractal lecel yourself whenever you finish a fractal that's at leadt one level above your personal fractal level. So if you're lvl 36, you can run fractals from 1-37. But you will only level up if you play lvl 37 fractal.
---
But, again, usually you would just join lfg and someone will already be in the group with high enough personal fractal level to open any fractals.
---
I thought youtubers made 1-2 videos per week to keep their viewers interested?
---
You might be on to something...
---
That's what I thought too. His points are not *wrong* but they don't serve GW2 very well. Aurene's death worked **only** because we had to wait months and read out-of-game blog posts, if nothing else we need timestamps at the beginning of each episode because otherwise her "death" followed by her immediate revival despite everyone being all doom and gloom becomes jarring. 
---
Eir's death was pitiful not for its place in the story but its presentation, both with the moving cage/us suddenly forgetting how to glide (despite gliding being a canonical component of these missions!) and because the lack of dignity never really paid off. Braham's arc from LS3E3 to LS4E1 or whenever wasn't a bad concept either but the way they pulled it off, the moment-to-moment screenplay during A Crack in the Ice was absolutely horrendous! 
---
Belinda was stuffed in the fridge, we all saw that "defeated NPC" icon the moment she was introduced, and now they made the inverse mistake of having a really well-written individual scene portraying grief and loss only it's a cheap mind-trick torture with no narrative weight behind it. They could just as easily have written that scene the exact same way with Seimur seeing images of his beloved Bloodstone cuisine being ruined.
---
And while it is true we don't know the post-mortem conclusion of Almorra's story yet we have enough precedents to keep hopes down. Sure some other writers could turn her into a recurring anti-villain or the next Kalla Scorchrazor but do we really trust ANet to do that justice even *if* they attempt it? Or is it far more likely they just killed off yet another "old guard" character whose main arc was done in their eyes and they needed a few bodies to raise the stakes?
---
If gw2 had a competent story this would totally make sense. Shame :/
---
My fractal level is too low to search for higher tiers
---
;c
---
Well I did cry when tybalt died, still do 😢
---
her resurrection was immediately and accurately predicted, immediately nullifying the effect on attentive players.
---
&gt; The fact they revived her next episode doesn't change any of this.
---
now imagine, or better yet ask someone playing these episodes back to back. it doesn't even take 5 minutes for her to come back to life, and the short stories are rather irrelevant as there is no in-game indication that they exist or that one should read them before continuing with war eternal.
---
If you play a mmo and you can't find a few evenings a week a few hours to play, you're playing the wrong genre and the game shouldn't be made to cater to people like you
---
Yes, but after hyping the boneskinner, it won't change the fact that what we currently have is garbage.
---
I was expecting something like the Battle of the Wall from A song of ice and fire, where the enemy will try to overrun the defenders with numbers in a desperate battle. Even something like actually losing a waypoint and the keep if they succeed and have to retake it.
---
Instead we got this.
---
I think we will get some flashback cutscene (less likely but one can hope) or long winded dialog exposition how Banger stabs Almora and Ryland berried her after.
---
What an ignorant, distasteful comment.
---
I ressed him through the gate. Take that, risen bastards.
---
So he wants people to excuse their shit storytelling by saying "it's episodic, it's not complete".
---
I'm sorry, but this is NOT how you make a story in an MMO and using the garbage "it's LS, it's episodic" when anyone with ANY experience with MMORPGs know LS is merely a fancy title for content patches is ridiculous.
---
That's funny I actually made an observation like this a long time ago too:
---
&gt;There is no conflict in tyria, no actual strugle inbetween anyone. All the factions seem to be getting alone fine both internally and externally with no real mass upheaval, and no one appears to distrust anyone. The only villains ever just so happen to be random traitors here and there, as if the current structures are just perfect and only the bad guys would want them gone.
---
&gt;All the factions get along just fine. There's some charr-human rebels but that's the full extent of any nuanced conflict and its never explored beyond "rebels bad, state good".
---
&gt;In season 2 we saw that the asura used to capture and experiment on sylvari, that was intresting, whatever happened to that? Oh, I guess they kinda stopped and are good buddies now?
---
&gt;Like no asura remain that still view sylvari as golems? No sylvari remain that distrust asura? No old wounds or old scars?
---
&gt;That intresting aspect is never seen and never explored in the main story and is forgotten immediately after its introduced, despite the fact that it basically happened about 30 years ago, and most of the people who suffered under it (and everyone who perpetuated it) are still alive.
---
&gt;HoT (Even its trailer) was supposed to be all about how now everyone distrusts the sylvari, mordrem or not, resulting in innocent sylvari getting the short end of the stick by their friends. But that aspect is also never actually explored in HoT or its aftermaths and never brought up again once.
---
&gt;Everytime the story comes close to getting intresting or having some grey area or nuance, it seems that just immediately forget about it, or try to get it over with as soon as possible so we can move to fighting more dragons while holding hands.
---
&gt;everyone seems to be getting along just fine in a perfect egalitarian world. There is no racism or sexism, or classism, or any sort of class struggle, or national conflict.
---
&gt;The thing about politics in videogames is that its insanely easy to do it without pissing everyone off: Don't be hamfisted about it. If both sides are represented fairly, nobody is going to be pissed. People don't dislike politics, they dislike propaganda.
---
&gt;People dislike politics in videogames because 99% of the time they are introduced as hamfisted soapboxing by hack writers who want to make propaganda for their side.
---
&gt;Nobody would mind if they actually showed both aspects of a refugee crisis affecting LA, both those who suffer within and without, because everyone would actually feel vindicated by it, and at the same time, it would make for nuanced/quality storytelling.
---
&gt;But again, they don't even have to touch controvertial subjects. The asura sylvari experimentation was a good subject to cover. The charr-human relations where a good subject to cover. The sylvari hivemind is a good subject to cover.
---
&gt;I mean fucking hell, we spent an entire expansion and an entire season in an area occupied by the theocratic cult of joko and just as things were picking up with his return, anet killed the whole plotline by having aurene eat him 5 minutes before the end.
---
&gt;And naturally afterwards, there was no power vacuum in elona. All the factions of elona just happily got along holding hands under a rainbow and joined us in the fight for dragons.
---
&gt;The biggest crime however, is class conflict.
---
&gt;We have a dictatorship, a technocracy, a military junta, a theocracy and whatever crazy ancap shit the Norn are up to.
---
&gt;There's a million and one intresting stories you can explore regarding class conflict under various different regimes in the living world. How would the poor in destiny reach react for example to the queen constantly shelling out forces to fight the dragons while they suffer? What about asura who want to remain neutral instead of sharing their tech with potential future enemies? The norn have no government, what happens when they decide they don't want to fight anymore? You can't force them.
---
&gt;Speaking of the the norn, they are a complete meme. Can you recall the last time they did ANYTHING in the story before living saga?
---
&gt;All the races of tyria have been whitewashing to the point of being practically interchangable. The only thing unique about them is that once in a while, the charr will donate a tank or two, and once in a while, the asura will provide a mcguffin that solves whatever dead end the writers wrote themselves into this week.
---

You do dailies in your tier, in start of a tier your frac lvl goes up quickky, slower how longer u are in the tier cause less dailies above your lvl

At some point u will be able to join rally group 1 tier higher

&gt; Aurene's resurrection wasnt earned in the story.
---
That much makes sense and isn't necessarily bad writing. It was a "prophecy/chessmaster" story in which we saw preordained events play out with the "characters" as pawns rather than individual agents.
---
I'd really like to know the in-universe explanation as to why no one ever picked up on the fact Aurene, despite being a weaker, less experienced and probably less gifted prophet, could see her own death clearly throughout many possible futures while Glint saw only a haze and only *guessed* she might die from her inability to actually see the truth. (And yes I am entirely aware of the narrative/out-of-universe reasons such as spoiling the "surprise" or the emotional weight for us consumers)
---
How come you always stop responding the instant I bring up the actual wikipedia definition of whitewashing and how it applies?
---
Do sources make your righteousness vanish or what?
---
Yeah, they're probably exaggerating, but I myself have had a character stuck in the instance for ten minutes because we had a druid who refused to gg.
---
So we're just going to call him a liar when there's still at least one other boneskinner that we haven't even fought yet? I say "at least one" because there's also dialogue stating that anyone can become a boneskinner through cannibalism (because it's basically a wendigo), and you also basically assist in creating one in an achievement that may or may not be a thing later.
---
Nice useless post, welcome to the discussion.
---
Life is not gaming 24/7 . Get a life m8 or you will be too old and alone and you could have been using your player time to learn Chinese or something.
---
Seriously do what you like but real life &gt; game always.
---
dead game? lol um there is always someone online when I play everyday and always groups to get into, that doesn't seem dead to me.. but coming from a person who has their reddit score hidden, I guess this is the type of post to expect from that person. lol
---
&gt;I'm cool with them removing a common MMO new player progression feature if it means they sell more copies of Path of Fire that way. 
---
"let's remove a feature and it'll magically make people buy more copies of our expansion!!"
---
what?
---
surprisingly yet still underwhelmingly they help with champ CC bars, as the special action usually becomes available with their CC phase.
---
Avoid reddit. The game is fine.
---
&gt;So we're just going to call him a liar when there's still at least one other boneskinner that we haven't even fought yet?
---
Yes, because there being more than one does not change the fact they promised one thing and, so far, they delivered none of it.
---
You people excuse ANet's mistakes way too much and then end up wondering how the game went downhill.
---
3 strike missions are size of regular fractal or raid. That's repeatable content for me right there...
---
For starters i thought i'm simply going with a DPS build for open world, stories and story dungeons.
---
I don't know if i want to do fractals/raids/WvW/etc later, but i do know that i want a supporter build at some point. I always liked the supporter roles in MMOs :)
---
But it's good that i'm good to go for now for stories and some dungeons.
---
Crafting is a good point, too. I leveled Tailoring from 0-400 yesterday (and leveled myself from 72-80...kinda felt like cheating to get so much xp :D) and weaponsmith is at 20 or so, which i want to get to 400 when i have the gold for it.
---
Thanks for the tips and links! :)
---
\&gt;&gt;  as stupid and blind as Jessica Price 
---
That is a gross exaggeration and you know it.
---
This at best is a mild jab at people unsatisfied with the short episode but it made reference to no one in particular.
---
Jessica Price blew up in a simple twitter Q&amp;A, name and shame a content creator "ass hat" while setting her twitter followers on him, then continue to doubled down on a non-existent sexism narrative until she and a fellow co-worker got fired. Then she cried about on how her boss firing her because he is a man and she is a woman.
---
I don't think the episode is great either, but this kind of personnel attack is not warranted.
---
1. asked in map chat, no answer there. 2. I didn't even know about anyone creating guides or videos for this since Dulfy left. So thanos for your attitude.
---
Since they are new ppl are still doing them,
---
The writing has never been great, but the acting and line delivery is top notch. I think the voice actors deserve some credit for their work even if we're missing half the formula that makes a good story experience.
---
Even with alll this it will take years before they shut down, so i am fine, even with current state they have like 5 to 10 years before they go bankrupt
---
Notice how all you did was focus on that comment and didn't even bother to try to argue everything else. Well done.
---
Didn't we  literally *just* have a thread urging community to STOP stalking developer social media?
---
He didn't mention GW2, there for this is unrelated.
---
I kind of enjoyed that he kind of acted as a test for us from Jormag just like the rest of the instance was a test from raven and was also used as jormags mouth to speak to us directly to say something other than the usual "me dragon me exist for long time and can't be defeated! Me angry me crush puny commander!". Or maybe that's just me who thought it was pretty cool that Jormag seems to not want a direct conflict with the person who's killed 3 dragons and a former god, and thier elder dragon buddy....you know...like any being with a brain and a hint of self preservation would want.....
---
just do fractals daily you will build up a ton and I mean a ton of +1 AR (i have about 7k in my bank right now sitting there...) and upgrade yourself to 150 AR, then you can join any T4 daily group you want.  Problem solved..
---
Uhhh, did you actually read their comments on this sub? They were sad that the new map was small, criticized the subway promotion rewards, and said GW2 “missed the mark on everything ffxi got right”. You’re correct that the account is new, but I see no other evidence that the account is spam.
---
Know the fucking diference, mom!
---
Worlds shittiest conspiracy theorist
---
The attempt to build Belinda's death as a huge dramatic moment was doomed from the start. From the moment she was introduced she might as well have had a red armor and a sign over her head that said WARNING! REDSHIRT SISTER DEATH IMMINENT IN NEXT CHAPTER!
---
And then she's dangling there like a puppet with two Kasmeers in the shot.
---
Don't give them ideas. Those clowns are so obsessed with the gemstore milking that this could be a thing.
---
I'm thinking it kinda sucks that we have the masteries now and no use for it. But inevitably they will be required in the next map. And it'd suck *way* more to farm masteries on a map you need those masteries for to navigate.
---
I dont think he will take all that long
---
I felt much more compelled to get new skins that I wouldn't use, just to get that juicy tiered reward
---
He is right about immediate gratification, but it just doesn't hold up on GW2 schedule and storytelling as of now. When you reach episodic content like this you better have some good content and story to fill each episode, not simply go "you need to wait until it's all done".
---
Oh no I'm ready! :)
---
I was saying that the positive reaction helps reinforce that design decision. We can now generate data to say "Hey this meets our goals AND players really like it. We should include it in X release."
---
I was already skeptical after reading the blog post, but after playing with the mastery my initial impressions were definitely right.
---
Usefulness aside, the way you stack and maintain these buffs is incredibly inconvenient. There's little organization to the events on the map outside of the meta, so it's difficult to plan for any particular event by stacking up the appropriate buff in advance - especially since you (typically) need to travel to a different part of the map to find the right enemy type, and then you only get 15 minutes to play with the full charge. Timing this narrow window to make full use of the buff is just too much trouble to make me go out of my way for it.
---
I've definitely noticed that the typical mobs on the new map are more of a challenge than almost anywhere else in the game, and I welcome that because it's tedious going around the place feeling like it's some PoE-style farm. 
---
The champs are really poor, though. I'm far from an elite player and even I feel I could solo most of them. Boneskinner is perhaps the most disappointing of all.
---
I bet Tom Abernathy is a homosexual. There is no other way he could be the narrative director at ArenaNet.
---
Prove me wrong.
---
Gw2 deaths are a fucking pointless joke with the only exception of our Mentor death at Claw Island that was actually nicely done and was emotional impactful. The fun part is that Almora's death was such a joke and so bad written that even the Commander didn't give a single fuck. His lines along with Jhavi's were so lazy ass written that I actually laughed. Also, is quite insulting comparing a tv show (1h long episode per week) with gw2 episodes which are 2h long (max) every 3-4 months. Most of the players don't know/don't remember/don't care about what happened in the previous episode which was 3 months ago.  
---
PS: I would have told him my thoughts @twitter but he has blocked me. Maybe for calling Arenanet devs a bunch of untalented clowns.
---
Liches have been a thing since GW1, it's a kind of necromantic magic, pretty sure people must have known more about it by GW2's time. The reason why no one seemed to voice any concern is because Joko is known to be a bit of a liar, so it seems it was assumed he lied about it.
---
I think they decided that they business model works even without expansions
---
Most players on Reddit that are protesting the game are those vets who have finished absolutely everything on the game and are starving for more and more new content. For newish players such as yourself there is easily at least a couple of years' worth of content if you play at an average pace of a couple of hours each day. You're fine.
---
Phasing, like instances? Yea it did come up. That is absolutely an option and in hindsight may have been the better approach. However, at the time we didn't want to create a flow where the player gets to a loading screen interacts for a very short sequence then gets to another loading screen so quickly.
---
&gt;I think we will get some flashback cutscene (less likely but one can hope) or long winded dialog exposition how Banger stabs Almora and Ryland berried her after.
---
So why didn't we get it in this Episode?
---
You know, the same Episode that introduces the Raven Lents which shows us what happened to her and Jhavi till we conveniently stop using it.
---
The characters certainly took her death harder than I did. 
---
Because I knew it wouldn't stick. Too much build-up, and too many fan theories about how eating Joko gave her Lich Energy so she could revive herself.
---
Noted! Thanks for the feedback :)
---
Woo! Thank you! I'll pass it along to the team.
---
No one is asking you to feel sorry for his poor writing. But a slightly defensive tweet doesn't make him blind, stupid, or a raging sexist like Jessica Price.
---
That makes him, at worst, incompetent at his job.
---
There is no need to dial from 0 to 10 in an instant.
---
So a minimum amount of content while keeping the gem store asal the main part of content updates. That's called maintenance mode, friend
---
What he fails to grasp is that the dis-satisfaction of this death doesn't stand alone. A-net has a history of killing off beloved characters to further the plot. In fact it's so bad you could turn it into a drinking game. And some of us are tired of it. It doesn't trigger the feels emotion any longer for us, instead it just causes disappointment in their narative team. If i was to compare the story of gw1 and the story of gw2, the story in gw1 is better simply because it doesn't do this Whedon like trope as much.
---
Well, if if you're personally disappointed by the devs and their promises over and over again, and don't think their content in worth the wait, by all means move on to something different.
---
Personally for me it's not a big deal, and I enjoyed the episode and its content even the episode was smaller-scale than usual. I still enjoy the game very much, and it has plenty of existing content for me to tackle as I wait for new stuff.
---
I honestly don't understand all the rage and complaining reddit is always full of. Sure, devs not living up to expectations or releasing buggy/broken/lackluster features *is* a good reason to share discussion and even lash out in anger. That obviously means players care about the game and its future. But I see these same users posting after every single patch and complaining about everything, and they don't seem to be happy with *anything* Anet does, ever. The game certainly doesn't seem to cater to their wants and needs at all, and if a game keeps letting you down and disappointing you time and time again, wouldn't it just be better to move on for good? What good does the endless complaining do when things are obviously not going to change?
---
That's just my two cents, as I'm honestly very tired of the constant negativity. If it's not a too short, 'no-content' patch, it's useless masteries, or too grindy collections, or WvW/PvP/raids/fractals being forgotten and dead content, or whatever happens to be the main topic for complaints that time. If I was a new player scouting out reddit before downloading the game, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.
---
This guy is way too up his own ass
---
Because i'm sure the mastery was added to stop bots :/
---
Haha. I understand :). I think it's a balance. I used the vanity item example because it was a clearer picture, but the fact is true in any MMO regardless of the business model. In WoW I remember waiting in line to kill specific "unique" creature bosses. That breaks immersion just inherently, and its because the way MMOs are built. We've gotten better over the years with new tech but that is still really expensive to make and usually requires making it from the start of the project.
---
You're not a nob! Legit question! I didn't mean to blame any player but rather the inherent nature of MMOs. I wouldn't blame the seller either :)
---
Well, the open world is the place for those who burn time and gib money to eanet.
---
For the rest of the players theres raids, fractals, mid tier+ pvp and wvw.
---
Strikes are the middle ground i guess? (Grothmar one is for open worlders).
---
It would be disingenous to ask anet to alienate their customer base. They won't kill their cash cow (they are milking it to death instead).
---
Aren't you tired...
---
Rest...
---
I wouldn't disregard 2 out of the 3 major game modes just like that. Besides, not even all PvE is getting updates, just de LS. Dungeons and guild missions where abandoned long ago and fractals and raids might follow the same path
---
i'm pretty sure i'll lose my job if they find me sleeping
---
Or ask the Wildstar Crowd for that matter.
---
you're a dumb dumb for listening to reddit drama
---
The strike mission hasn't hit the rotation yet... Wtf are you talking about? 
---
&gt;so far, they have delivered none of it.
---
I don't think you know how lying works lol. If someone says "I'm going to do X on friday", they're not just a liar by default until friday... They're a liar if it's saturday and they didn't do X like they said they would. You have to at least wait until saturday to call them a liar though.
---
If someone says they'll give you a ride home, do you just sit there saying "liar liar liar liar liar liar liar" for the whole ride until you're home? lmao
---
I'm not excusing ANet for anything, because there's no lie until we have the boneskinner strike mission to be able to even say if it was or wasn't a lie. How do you not understand this? I'm not some fanboy that's going to defend it if the boss isn't what was described, but it's absurd to just call someone a liar because "well it's not here yet". You have to at least have the thing you're saying was lied about ffs.
---
i guess you're good then, but lots of maps you encounter will be devoid of people, since the population decreased and we have much more maps than at release
---
Death of Blish hit me more than Tybalt's death I think.
---
That's fair criticism! In order for us to make players not stand on her we'd have to create invisible collision, which always felt really odd because we haven't done that historically. Even Glint in Episode 5 of last season, people could stand on her.
---
And an instance may reduce the chance you see people stand on her but you always run the risk of playing the instance with people who end up standing on her or doing something silly. I agree though, an instance might have been more appropriate. Thank you for the feedback!
---
Basically this. A lot of people here are just getting mad because of some examples of character deaths in the past that people didn't feel were well written. The point still stands that you don't know the purpose of narrative development that comes from a death until you actually see it. It's fine to have low expectations of how they'll handle it based on the past, but immediately insisting it's "shock value" (when it wasn't shocking) is dumb. 
---
In general though as much as I feel frequently perplexed and disappointed at Anet's narrative choices, the complaints I see on this sub regularly about character death (this thread included) are hot garbage to me. Some of ya'll really think death has to be deeply meaningful and ceremonious and we have to experience every ounce of closure for it to be valid. People ate up Tybalt/Forgal/Sieran because it was a heroic death even though it didn't really make sense that they would have to hold the risen back, not to mention issues with how all 3 of them would do this canonically. 
---
Basically, some of you will die to something completely senseless like a brick flying through your windshield right after getting a promotion and the people who knew you but not very well will get over it in a week. Death is shit and Tyria being a magical universe doesn't change that.
---
Lol imagine comparing watchmenhbo to gw2 plain story
---
Oh awesome! I'm so glad you liked the rewards structure and the masteries. I loved running around collecting orbs with burst of speed and then getting to use the Essence blasts. It was all super satisfying.
---
This comment made me check your last few posts.
---
Almost all of them targeting tpot, Nike and a few other players in particular and veterans in general.
---
Pretty entertaining. Textbook example of a toxic casual.
---
If you're a dumb dumb you'll love gw2 tbh. Its very good at appealing to the lowest common denominator.
---
I had the same thought as you that it should randomly appear and down you. Another interesting mechanic would be if it is more likely to attack if you're alone, ex out of a certain range away from at least one other player. Imagine exploring the map, getting a debuff that says you are being hunted, and realizing how alone you are. 
---
I really love the design of the boneskinner but it's pathetic how non-threatening it is.
---
They are like releasing the episodes earlier  rather than releasing faster. Like 4 months content separated into 2 months and 2 months.
---
Some of the best TV shows I've ever watched had mostly self contained episodic plots that also drove the series or season narrative. If GW2 did that they could have had a great episode 1 while setting the tone of LS5.
---
Instead here we are, blaming the consumer for being impatient instead of delivering something that can stand on its own merit like the prologue did.
---
Dumb dumb like instant gratification. Dumb dumb like shiny swords
---
How is that addictive, are you dumb? That's the amount of time you invest in a regular hobby (e.g. Working out a few times a week) or watching a few films per week like most parents/adults I know often do
---
&gt;tl; dr
---
I mean, if a handful of sentences is too long for you, I think that says more about you than me lol.
---
&gt;you just want to bitch about semantics.
---
You're literally the one that started the argument of "that's not a schedule" lmfao. I was pointing out that they have been on schedule for the last 2 years. That's not an argument of semantics. You not only don't know what a schedule is, but you also don't know what a semantic argument is...
---
&gt;Oh wow, they managed to release on time once in 7 years?
---
No, they were on time for the last 2 years of living world, by *your own* words*.*
---
&gt;So, you don't care if the releases are dry and content starved and released sparsly and you only want to argue semantics?
---
I do care. I said there's no point in arguing about it because it's a subjective topic, so there's no way for us to say the other is wrong about content opinions. I also didn't even say that I disagree with you about if it's good or bad. You're just making that assumption because you want to steer the conversation away from what we were talking about because you've been wrong on it several times now.
---
Also, again you were the one arguing semantics. I was addressing the objective facts of if they have been releasing on schedule or not. Which your own description says that they have been.
---
&gt;Correction, whether or not you like the update is subjective.
---
Yes, whether I like it or not is also subjective. I never implied otherwise. That's a topic of the enjoyment art and entertainment, which is almost completely subjective. I guess I shouldn't have assumed that I was talking to a rational adult that knows that.
---
&gt;The fact that the update was shitty and bad is objective.
---
I guess we'll add "Objective" to the list of things you don't understand... I still haven't even disagreed with your opinion that it's bad, but it would be subjective either way. 
---
&gt;You're free to be subjectively entertained by having keys shaken in front of you, that doesn't make it high quality.
---
I haven't said a word about thinking the update was good or entertaining. You're the one that keeps asserting what my opinion is on the content. I never disagreed with you on that. I only pointed out that you're factually incorrect about their stated release schedule and how consistently they have released on schedule. 
---
Which come to think of it, your point on that is made *even more* inaccurate by the fact that you say that they didn't have a schedule. You can't argue that "they didn't release on time *AND* that they didn't have a schedule. There has to be a schedule to even measure if they were on time or not... Hahahahah you're really good at contradictions!
---
&gt; Remember Stavemaster's black hole spell?
---
Refresh my memory?
---
And those players are playing those games, and will not play GW2 no matter how better its competitive modes get, since they already got the game they liked.  
---
For example, look at the progression of the top steam games since 2012:
---
https://youtu.be/_XNQZjdm3LQ
---
It took ages for a game to appear and surpass Dota 2 since it passed TF2. And that didn't last, Dota 2 came back up again.
---
Unless Stronghold was reworked into something more like a moba, with items and temporary gearing and leveling and the like, I really doubt it'll get even a drop from those markets.
---
E X P A N S I O N  W O R T H Y  C O N T E N T
---
Yes. The new story was added to stop players and the new mastery was added to stop bots. This way they need less servers and maintenance.
---
They constantly make millions from the cash shop for 7 years now. So it works quite well for them
---
Whatever . Relax .I just supposed  You have too much time to be a functional adult if u think " fee evening a week few hours each time " is the available time to play. I really envy you. 
---
That's why I said you are a kid.
---
This is why mmos are a dying genre. Competitive players and the vast market of actually casual players play different games.
---
The genre runs on nostalgia, potential and carebears that think "hardcore casual" isnt a contradiction. I suppose using it as euphemism is apt.
---
Er. I got that patch on the 19th.
---
Except that Svanir champ berserker, he claps even small groups.

---
It is scrapped expansion into living world. The strike missions are a giveaway it is a new type of feature like the bounties, a selling point someone might say.
---
We would never impose a hard limit, that would be elitist. 
---
Instead as a friendly community we will nicely suggest they fuck off while we race eachother to the bottom.
---
In a non competitive way of racing of course, competition leads to toxicity after all.
---
Thanks for the feedback!  
---
I'll reiterate what some have said here in that this was made for the player who isn't particularly well versed with boon/condition play or cc damage. This is for the player who may not be running the meta build and/or the player who wants an extra boost in strike missions. The main purpose of the blog post was to help communicate what this system is about as it does have a lot of moving parts. At the end of the day it is a mastery, not the reinvention of the system as a whole.  
---
It's important to call out that a shared open world is going to have a vast gradient of player skill. Even in this thread you can read people's thoughts on difficulty of mobs in ep 1, hot, and pof. Pleasing everyone is near impossible and so we made the design decision to focus on a specific demographic of our players which met our current goals of strike missions and introducing players to raids.  
---
Admittedly, the Boneskinner and the Icedaddy are too easy :) We are working of a fix and I apologize for that! The fact that so many of you have shared your thoughts constructively with an open mind to the future is very encouraging. You all care and so thank you for sharing that feedback! :)
---
You can join groups in that tier (1-25, 26-50, 51-75, 76-100) and by doing the dailies you'll open up the higher tiers which will push your personal level higher. If you do a level at or higher than your current personal level it will increase by 1. Say you are level 99 personal, if you do 99 or 100 only will it go to 100.

As opposed to a toxic elitist like yourself, Teapot and Nike?
---
If you hate the game so much then play something else, you'll obviously not find what you're looking for here.
---
But that's not what this is about right? Otherwise you'd be playing FF14 or WoW Classic like every other elitist treadmill lover who shouted so much that ArenaNet shifted focus from what actually matters to cater to you and now that they realized they've been alienating 99% of their players by making their anti-MMO yet another WoW clone and rectified their way, people like you come crawling out of the woodworks to cry wolf once again.
---
no I dont. I expose idiots with their BS "arguments". I dont speak for "everyone". thats what you morons are doing.

;)

&gt; I do find it amusing, however, how those same people believe they could write anything even remotely as good as GW2's story.

Well, but Anets story telling is pretty damn bad, or atleast not engaging. You always group up with your allies, listen to hours of scripted dialog until you kill a couple of mobs that pose zero thread just to listen to the next dialog.
---
They sadly dont really release that much instanced content, but the content they release often is not good - to be fair i was pleasently surprised about just how much better the strike mission was compared to the first and if the difference between the current and the next strikes is similar then we might have some good content there in a couple months.
---
Where does he state anything about the Guild Wars 2 story? Or speak in any sort of official capacity?
---
The amount of lies and twisting by posters on this sub is unbelievable at times.
---
I agree, it was so powerful and raw. Her screaming ...I just wanted to stop and say "There, there"!! Overall this episode had awesome voice acting and I loved every new chara!!
---
make a defense feel hopeless - let there be literal hordes of really low level icebrood! just to look scary but when you use your greatsword and whirl through them they all die, this way you atleast add some feeling!
---
could you imagine how much fun it would be if you could not break yourself out? and instead just slowly die over 20ish seconds or so unless a player breaks you out. Traversing the zone would feel engaging, you would be constantly on the lookout for a bonfire or a cave where the cold doesn't get you
---
I really hope not.
---
Only an idiot would want to get enslaved to a job that's best described as basically "eternal cosmic civil servant". A job that you can only quit if someone kills you and takes your place.
---
Even when the gods left Tyria they left to set shop somewhere else and had to leave people in charge behind. So it wasn't quitting, it was restructuring.
---
I prefer open ends in which the character gets to keep on adventuring.
---
Just saying, I think if it was similar to Auric weapon collections it would require everyone to play the map. Components of the weapons could be sold in TP maybe so those who participate after finishing the collection can still make gold.
---
That was amazing work. I guessed as much that no-one else could see the story NPCs, but it's not so in-your-face and as such went beautifully with the flow. I really enjoyed it.
---
With phasing I didn't mean instances, though, but to the technique of having a certain area look different to different characters. Like a village being burned down on one player's screen, but it still being prestine on another player's screen who didn't progress as far in the story. In this particular case it would've just phased out other players, not the surroundings, making it effectively a single player instance but without the loading screen and everything that comes with it and breaks the immersion.

I'm more interested in "why" than "who".
---
Bringing up the fact that he was a racist is pretty irrelevant here.
---
TL;DR Dismiss the 24/7 internet rage fest.
---
Why should we care about bots? I just don't like the way these masteries work.
---
Of course you did. Predictable hater.
---
The game is great. There's tons of stuff to do and you're not forced to grind 25/8 like in every other MMO.
---
Speaking of grinding 25/8, all these complaints you're seeing come from people who went into GW2 wanting to do exactly that despite GW2 having always been advertised as not having any of that outside of cosmetics.
---
Pay these doomposters no mind, honestly. They don't even know what they want or why they're complaining.
---
Ask yourself, would you complain about a game you don't play anymore? Or if you do play it, would you complain for years about something that's not going to change? Only if you've got psychological issues.
---
You can never salvage a Berserker's Inscription. The only ones that come from salvage are Cavalier's, Dire, Magi's, Rabid, Shaman's, and Soldier's as far as I know.
---
Sends out a small rolling orb that sucks in players and orbits them around it as it travels. Until it either times out or goes off a cliff with your commander.
---
&gt; I mean, if a handful of sentences is too long for you, I think that says more about you than me lol.
---
The ironic thing is that literally a single sentence was too long for you as you failed to read it. I was summing up your comment. Not asking for a tl; dr.
---
But I guess that was too much for you to read eh?
---
&gt;No, they were on time for the last 2 years of living world, by your own words.
---
No they weren't? They never gave proper release dates.
---
&gt;I do care. I said there's no point in arguing about it because it's a subjective topic, so there's no way for us to say the other is wrong about content opinions. I also didn't even say that I disagree with you about if it's good or bad. You're just making that assumption because you want to steer the conversation away from what we were talking about because you've been wrong on it several times now.
---
Except the content is shit. That's not an opinnion.
---
&gt;Also, again you were the one arguing semantics. I was addressing the objective facts of if they have been releasing on schedule or not. Which your own description says that they have been.
---
It says a lot that the best argument you can muster to defend your argument is just more semantics.
---
&gt;I guess we'll add "Objective" to the list of things you don't understand... 
---
It really is ironic how whenever someone takes an indefensible position they just start pretending that literally everything is subjective. I see this partically everywhere.
---
I can make dozens of arguments why the current state of the game is garbage, dead fractals, dead dungeons, no more legendaries, abandoned raids, dead pvp, dead wvw, abandonment of guilds ect ect.
---
Meanwhile the only argument you can make is "But i like having keys dangled in front of me, so its high quality entertainment"
---
Again, feel free to watch paint dry, but don't try to pretend that its high quality content.
---
&gt;I still haven't even disagreed with your opinion that it's bad, but it would be subjective either way.
---
Its not subjective, and the quality of the patch is just as important as the frequency in which we get them.
---
&gt;I haven't said a word about thinking the update was good or entertaining. You're the one that keeps asserting what my opinion is on the content. I never disagreed with you on that. I only pointed out that you're factually incorrect about their stated release schedule and how consistently they have released on schedule.
---
Except they haven't. "From now to 4 months maybe" is not a scedule. "We plan to release something whenever its ready, and after that, we also plan to release something whenever sometime in the future when its ready as well".
---
So you're saying that the Leshen is just a copy of a wendigo? I disagree, I think the Leshen is distinct enough from a wendigo in design.
---
Plus, if you're going to go as broad with the description as "live in forest. ugly. eats people.", they're both also the same as a bear lol.
---
Ah yeah, I haven't thought about that. It is indeed be more flexible for players this way, and it actually allows those who craft to save some gold for their trouble.
---
Though another concern I have is that players are able to finish the collection without actually playing in the map. I was able to unlock the collection, but I have no idea how and I only played the new episode on release day. And now, I would technically be able to finish the collection if I wanted to without playing any more of the episode.
---
Imagine watching a TV series and a new episode is coming out every 2-4 months instead of every week. 
---
GW2s story (just the actual plot, not the release cadence, voice acting etc.) was pretty okay for an MMO until they killed Joko. Joko was a great antagonist. He had a personality, a history and a motive behind his actions. Then they decided to replace him with Kralkatorrik, an elder dragon who had basically 0 voice lines until he was close to dying. And then you have the commander, the protagonist, who is incredibly shallow. It's fine to keep the protagonist's character as neutral as possible in an MMORPG like this but when both the protagonist and antagonist  have 0 personality your story is already set up for failure. Oh yeah, they had Aurene. Another dragon who was basically a child until she ascended to an Elder Dragon. She didn't speak until LS4EP5 and a lot about her was kept a secret.
---
And now we have LS5. The prologue looked promising introducing Ryland and Bangar, however we didn't get to interact with any of them in EP1, only Jhavi, the fraenir and Jormag. The former showing basically 0 personality, only history and the latter being another Elder Dragon who seems to be a "lite" version of Mordremoth.
---
Anet, you need to get your playerbase excited with this story, not keep everything a mystery until 6 months from now.
---
I mean, I'm probably one of the harshest and most thorough critics of GW2 design out there, [to the point I even call the storyline a walking simulator.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dzcdp9/reddit/f86tfn4/?context=3). But even I just say "ANET" instead of singling out developers or posting their personal media....
---
I would like to politely ask u/MichramGW2 to delete this thread.
---
* Advantages:
---
 * The objective gets the aura and other passive your guild has unlocked, like the +5/+10 supply grabbed by allies, so they can carry more supply to attack enemy objectives. 
---
 * If you have permissions, you can use consumables and tactics your guild has unlocked and crafted. 
---
* Disadvantages:
---
 * If you do not ask first, you may give a location less upgrades than someone else could. 
---
Long story short, if you have at least +5 supply, always claim at least camps. If you don't have much more aura upgrades than that, ask if there's someone else nearby with better upgrades so they can claim instead.  
---
In each map, overall try to keep the best upgrades closer to your home base, as getting people to defend those is faster and thus they can use a better advantage than a farther point that will often get captured before anyone can get there to defend it and thus no one really gains benefit from the aura there.
---
Shhhh!
---
In any case, I hope we will get soundtrack soon cause that Boneskinner theme is beautiful
---
Someone tell him GW2 is an MMO and not a single player game. It'll blow his r/iamverysmart mind.
---
Yes, gw2 is an mmo, than why do they focus on story and not on gameplay and group content? The Iamverysmart in this case fits not me but Anet.
---
Yeah, I'm not against criticism of Arenanet and there is a lot that we can criticise and note as being implemented poorly from sPvP updates to fractal releases through to build templates and story length.
---
There are a whole host of things that we can discuss and be reasonably negative about (ideally without the vitriol and hyperbole). 
---
But dredging someone's personal Twitter for comments unrelated to the game and then posting them here without any context is just asking for drama and harassment which is something that has been happening to Anet devs more recently.
---
It's not a great thing to do.
---
Half of fanfic writers on AO3 do a better job of cliffhanging and character deaths than Anet's narrative department.
---
Yeah, they didn't feel too impactful, but it might be the case that they intend to ease us in to them and for them to be much more needed in episode 2 and beyond
---
an *actual* hint for you: most of the ppl who got fired were working on non gw2 related projects.
---
and another one for free: gw2 kept a studio of around 400 ppl and 3 unannounced projects alive for nearly 7 years.
---
but yeah, gw2 made and makes no money....
---
GW2 endgame: opening launcher watching loading screen and repeat.
---
Also those Fallen enemies in the forest, in the "close the portal" events? They can swarm *hard.*
---
spyware to detect empty file and banwave for it, haha can you imagine if this happened?
---
&gt; The special is good for breakbars but it's actually a DPS loss for competent characters.
---
The one that gives a ton of Quickness should always be a DPS gain.  If your excuse for it not being a DPS gain is that you've already got maximum Quickness from other sources, then you're trying to apply fractal/raid group setups to the open world and that's something that never ends well.  Or you're playing an actual Quickness-generating character like Deadeye or Firebrand, in which case this might be a situation to change into Daredevil or Dragonhunter like they said you might want to.
---
If the map doesn't cap half the time then how is the cap of 100 to small? Genuinely confused reading your comment.
---
We get it, you don't like this game.
---
I really would have liked if the Norn from Auric Basic who was trying to befriend and have a vinetooth as his pet was here again. It would be a nice callback if he was still shirtless and just as ready to adopt the bone skinner in the new map
---
No i know about those from achievement . Ty for teaching me something . I'll stop using blc tool to dis exotic when they have this stats.
---
No sarcasm
---
Btw I crafted just enough skins to reach tier 2 of renowned weapons to unlock the scepter. I do not like other rewards. Helm is ugly and I do not need bag. 
---
Not sure about mastery point but since I unlocked  all the current masteries  I suppose they will add new points when they will release level 3
---
It's totally worth it. I have both, but I haven't looked back since buying the Primal Spirit. The dye channels are pretty good, you could probably get some really unique combinations.
---
I've never had a problem getting groups for lower tier fractals tbh, if you post yourself it generally fills quickly and if you bring dps/know what you're doing its pretty easy to just carry the group through at lower levels.
---
The breakbar on the channelling warden isn't really intended to be broken, it's a rather strong one.  It's just intended to keep the fight lasting long enough for all of Rytlock and Crecia's dialogue to play out.
---
you could have used the energy you wasted in the last day to make 5 threads to shit on the game and stir up drama, to go and actually play one of these "real" mmos and spare us your presence.
---
Still better than supporting China goverment.
---
By removing access to fall damage reduction, players are *slightly* more likely to buy the expansion for access to gliding and mounts for faster world navigation and less deaths from falling.
---
do you know why we don't have cantha ?
---
This doesn't really work when it's being compared to TV series that, before binging, came out with a new episode weekly.
---
Because ANet hate China. /s
---
More organized players do ten times the damage of less organized players. That is a nightmare to build a game around. Pretty sure the "trust me, you'll need the extra power" was directed more towards people with a less optimized playstyle.
---
Plus, it is actually a nice extra, because some of these events throw a TON of shit at you, that can easily overwhelm even glass cannons.
---
&gt; Also I uninstalled it
---
then go away
---
So tell me another good MMORPG,with no pay to win (or pay-to-anything) nowadays? There is not.  
---
That genre is almost dying.
---
becuase there are still server (language), friendslist and guild stats taken into account when the game creates overflows.
---
If you never played the game before the 30 bucks you will spend on the expansion is a lot of content.  Depending how deep you dive into everything these is to do, it can take you months to complete.
---
Living stories will cost you more but come with new maps, masteries, and abilities.  I'd say LS4 is the best value for the mounts.
---
That being said.  The living story maps are kind of dead.  They did not have any replay value beyond completion.  End game in all 3 modes is kind of in a stale state and isn't likely to change anytime soon.
---
The game is kind of being developed in minimalist mode.  This recent episode offered about 8-12 hours of play time in about 2-3 months of development.  End game content development has likely been shelved according to a recent developer interview  However there will be a festival in between each episode, great filler if you haven't done them in previous years.
---
Great buy for new players, just not such good news for long term players.
---
To me it felt like more of an optional bonus objective as the channel *does* kill the prisoners, maybe also a scaling bug. I would assume breaking him saves the prisoners and possibly prevents the second phase where he turns Icebrood.
---
Not directly, no, he doesn't specifically say "Guild Wars 2". However, you're incredibly dense if you think the storytelling philosophies of the ***Narrative Director*** of GW2 doesn't impact the game's story. So I'd argue you're incorrect to say it has nothing to do with Guild Wars 2.
---
I do play other games, I don't play gw2 much anymore. I'd like to play gw2 more, unfortunately its riddled with toxic casuals telling us to gtfo.
---
I don't see why youd think I want a treadmill or would go to wow or ffxiv. I enjoy competitive or challenging/ fun gameplay. 
---
Grinding gear or grinding fashion isnt what I consider gameplay.
---
It is different. Don't you see the name change and a different icon for TP?
---
It's a classic PR move. Give it a new name so it sounds like a fancy new thing. Old wine in new skins
---
&gt; server (language)
---
NA. The only languages we have are English, Spanish, and a minority of french. Also, we don't have servers for languages on NA.
---
&gt;friendslist and guild stats taken into account when the game creates overflows.
---
Which isn't working properly because if there's room to combine both maps, they really should.
---
They should clarify that in their official posts like:
---
"If you are new player, you will need this extra power" 
---
Just like with "two free build templates" was a lie, they have been going towards really slippery slope slide where they keep lying to community.
---
Game still has a very solid playerbase.
---
You can play for free with some restrictions, when you buy the expansions the restrictions will be gone. I recommend trying free for some time and upgrade later if you like it.
---
There is no pay 2 win in the game, all store items are mostly cosmetic or quality of life, you can also convert in-game gold to gems.
---
Am I the only one how our patience was rewarded when aurene died for 5 minutes of playtime?
---
People that bring up politics for no apparent reason are the worst people you can find on the internet. Nobody cares about your (the person I'm replying to) political ideals when discussing story themes in an mmo. There is a place and time to do that.
---
Going to the ol' hitler switcheroo is an overused trick by politically minded individuals to make it seem like something it's relevant when it's clearly not.
---
Maybe I should be careful on how I’ve used free. I just know that I’ve paid for 2 ultimate editions of xpacs and was very satisfied with the breadth of things to do, yet all of these free injections leaving me wanting.. I’d prefer buying more ultimate editions than getting the next type of glowy antlers with no guarantee of content.
---
It's free CC with a cool aesthetic effect.  It may be a "DPS-Loss" for more competent players, but it isn't really designed for us.  It's an RGB strobe-light laser that does great break-bar damage and it's likely designed to teach break-bar value.  It's true that there's not much chance to use it outside of meta-events, but it is starting to shine in the meta as more and more people unlock the new mastery.
---
Love it. I sadly dont have time to grind like I used to.
---
scam
---
6 tits or I walk..
---
This. Good points on wrong hands.
---
There is a hidden achievement tied to this. &lt;3 Do you feel sleepy?
---
Good one, hope to see it used more in the future.
---
I know People meme About it but thats (a part of, still hoping for some of them sweet elite specs) what I understand under "Expansion Content". 
---
Theres so many small qol and engine changes in this update the longer i Play it the more i like it
---
Uhmmm, I think it's banked and not wasted...
---
Yeah, I saw that. It makes things hazey when you show us a support build and then don't tell us what gear stats, sigils, or even foods to us.
---
Most of us already know what the traits and stuff do. I was curious most about the PS build in terms of might duration and strength runes, food, etc.
---
I mean that movie predates this by 18 years though and presumably popularized that design as long ago. If something looks like the common pop culture version of X, I think it's fine to just say "it looks like X". I don't think we have to get into the historical accuracy if the "wrong" one is so common. If you google image search "wendigos", you see a lot of things that look like the boneskinner lol. So I think it's fair.
---
Interesting video though!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Praising ANet isn't very welcome around here. Especially when it comes to their story which apparently everyone could have written better.
---
You don't need to be a veteran chef to complain about burnt food.
---
Common sense:-P
---
Wasn't the Renegade healing? They were using Ventari and some kind of power weapon.
---
It's still cool to see people 3 manning it. I enjoy the new strike mission.
---
Thx, I will add it to my list:-)
---
Emotion is pointless if it comes out of nowhere, like happens most of the time. It's cheap, and sad, but for the wrong reasons.
---
&gt;It wasn't impactful at all
---
In the time between those episodes there were plenty of posts about how it affected people and people drew art and comics about it so it may not have been impactful on you but the evdience on this subreddit says differently.
---
Screw Raven. It's like a Moa on crack.
---
Takes way too long to stack. Make it faster to get, but also do less damage.
---
10 Slot Bag is an exotic so it's a nice "rare" item to keep even though you won't use it.
---
There are enough mp to ignore that as a whole but two weapons are cheap since most of the materials came from other achievements .
---
Back is really ugly too
---
Yea i presumed so. But I meant specifically in your case: trying to leave the group to join the guild run. Can’t you leave the group in that case too?
---
Some is definitely banked, but don't know if all of it.
---
Anyways, exp is really plentiful thing to get, so should not hurt that much. Until you need thousands of spirit shards.
---
When did that happen? I don't remember.
---
Highly disagree.
---
Or you could look on snowcrows at builds which are already min-maxed for 10 man content
---
The extra power does like 10k dmg? I think my burn stacks do twice that much each second.
---
Ah, classic!  The old: “dunt liek dunt play gaem LUL”.  What a super non-toxic way to address valid criticism and opinions.
---
The people who will kill the game (other than Anet management) are folks like you who want to silence everyone who doesn’t agree with you in every way.
---
If you’re tired of “cOnStAnT nEgAtIvItY” I recommend the official forums where you can discuss your favorite quaggan or praise doing the bare minimum.
---
&gt; Personally for me it's not a big deal, and I enjoyed the episode and its content even the episode was smaller-scale than usual. I still enjoy the game very much, and it has plenty of existing content for me to tackle as I wait for new stuff.
---
There it is.  Because *you* think there is nothing wrong and *you* are “satisfied” with the update everyone else is wrong and should “stop being negative”.
---
Why are you commenting on these critique posts and coming back to these “negative” forums if you don’t like it?
---
I once heard from a wise man, “if you don’t like the content of this subreddit, move on to something different”.
---
I wrote the very first paragraph of this post just for you.
---
Besides having wings, a staff, 2 legs and 2 arms. How exactly are you matching?
---
Did aurene tank a hit from kralk? I don't remember.
---
Shell shock is probably one of the best personal quests in the game. It was really good and i personally liked how lot of choices came with their own kicks in the side, aside from Tonn's wife who's just an annoying, miserable grouch with misplaced feelings of resentment, that doesn't go away as she calls us "commander of death" for trying to prevent an elder dragon from turning everyone into salad people.   
---
Some other plotline deaths were rather bad, such as human PC sister being sad about a guy that got killed by cutscene power.
---
You want to win GW2 PvE?
---
Play a guardian.
---
Buff, heal, support, DPS all at the same time and faceroll through everything.
---
Right. But how did that "shock" anybody? Her death falls in line with a common trope that she completed her main goal so was good for the chopping block. The hinted at her death a bit too. I can't be the only person who expected it, which makes it less shocking and doesn't seem like it was meant to be. 
---
I think for the most part this can go two ways: (1) it's just used to pivot towards developing Jhavi as the Vigil lead or sorts, and (2) Almorrah ends up being brought back as Icebrood or used by Jormag to taunt or convince us to be on her side. Or they put in some other kind of twist, or all of the above. Who knows. I doubt they will literally do nothing with it at all.
---
"well the guy was a racist but this is a video game so lets not talk about it" there was no racism involved, nothing to see here, move along
---
100% true.
---
The running around and collecting of the energy balls is kind of annoying and tedious. Sometimes they are even hard to see as they don't stick out very well in some environments. It's almost 2020, drops like that should be auto-collected, they should magnetize to the player when he gets within a larger range of them. We should feel rewarded after grinding out a mastery, not feel like we have to work even more after killing mobs just to charge up a bar (that takes way too long) for a randomly timed special skill blast.
---
GGGs model only works cause they have
---
1. a bunch of fanboys that spend money on buggy garbage
---
2. pump out buggy garbage every 3 month so they can make money the first week, then abandon the buggy garbage to produce more buggy garbage for the next league
---
Now tell me how is this relevant to the message you replied.
---
its insane how easily people fall for pr.
---
&gt; Right. But how did that "shock" anybody? 
---
She's been an important character for 7 years. You don't think suddently killing such a long term character unceremoniously is shocking?
---
&gt; I can't be the only person who expected it, which makes it less shocking and doesn't seem like it was meant to be.
---
Everyone expected it the instant we heard her act wonky on the coms. 
---
The shock is that anet decided to kill such a long term in this way.
---
For real, do you not see why a character who has been around since the books dying offscreen all of a sudden might be "shocking"?
---
As a new player, it is really a steal. 
---
There is a ton of story, maps, exploration, mini-quests, etc to do. The Hardcore itch for a new player can be covered by raids and Fractals. At least for a while. Definitely $30 worth. 
---
As much as I grumble as a vet, it really is a great deal for new players that aren't interested in the competitive side.
---
Burnt food would be an accurate way to describe how they ended season 3. This would be more like raw cookie dough icecream, gross and stupid to some people but others actually really like the experience.
---
Agree with all your points. The execution of the story is more often than not wanting, and it's always a big case of: '*it's not what they say it's how they say it*' being the issue. We all knew Aurene wasn't dead but them basically saying that because "everyone" knew it they should just drop the pretense of that event, and bring her back right at the start of the next episode, rather than actually *crafting* actual story beats that build up from hopelessness to a "triumphant return" at the eleventh hour, came off as not even trying. Not their intention I'm sure, but it certainly felt like it playing through those episodes again recently.
---
And you know sure, they laid the groundwork with Joko's lich magic being the reason for Aurene's return earlier in the season, but what does that say about Joko himself? What about his character? His character is wasted. The entire first three episodes of season 5 were there, not to actually say anything about Palawa Joko; or the state of Elona; or even the Commander's effect on greater world at large, but simply to place a chess piece on the board that they needed to perform a cheap fake out, with no real time to follow up on its consequences properly, because how could you follow up on it when you've got just one episode left with limited story budget left to tell it.
---
Also speaking of things dying and returning, I don't think they're quite done yet with Almorra either, since her spirit appears in the new open world map occasionally after her death, so I wonder if the threat Jormag is making a fuss about has something to do with the damage done to the Mists. If that's the actual case, then I'm just wondering whether it'd have been better to have had Almorra go down fighting in the final confrontation with Kralkatorrik proper, since that's where her story legitimately ends, rather than use her force ghost to inform us of potential issues with the Mists caused by that dragon. Still, it'd be nice if "spent" characters didn't have to die all the time though.
---
Okay. I rambled.
---
That definitely looks like an AT-AT, a battery and turret from Hoth.
---
Either it'll be a reference or these are just placeholders.
---
But why was he not playing condi if he was playing DPS?
---
This is a nice post and thanks for sharing! I'll only comment on the Thief suggestion to note that you can switch out Deadly Arts for Trickery. You'll get some extra boon share this way while you don't get two stolen skills from Deadeye's Mark you do get a reduced CD on the Mark.
---
and never forget how they neglected veteran players to cater to newer ones, who never even reach the game yet
---
they gave for free hot, an expansion most of us payed 25 to 50 bucks, some players even more, and what do they give us back to the ones who bought it? one of the ugliest gliders they could come up with
---
birth day gifts are so crappy it's unbelivable, i got my 5th gift right before i quitted, and i was just laughing at it, a xp scroll for a 5 year time player... got enough books i don't know wtf ill do with them now and they give me a xp scroll.... a random dye, a few tp to a friend, and karma, wtf karma works for in a 5 year old account?
---
most veterans went for the legendary armor as a endgame farm, templeates ruined those too
---
most veterans grew tired of living story and open world maps, moved into pvp/wvw/raids/fractals, all of them completely neglected
---
and the complete disaster of the balancing team, making specs we used to love (for example i played chrono since it was released till late pof) completely useless in several game modes, just to try to fix a strictly raiding problem...
---
or the addition of warclaw to wvw driving most veteran players mad and forcing them to quit the game mode because of how lazy the release was, just adding a mount without even thinking the impact it would have
---
most of my veteran friends, and me that i've been playing non stop for 5 years, felt insulted by all of this, specially the ones who don't even play living story or give a shit about it, for example i only liked wvw, and pvp was my afterburn for when i got bored, now i can't play neither of those modes because i simply can't enjoy current meta, pof specs design and this dumbed down combat we have, designed for monkeys, and a complete wow clone with a stupid trinity, where the healer is also the freaking tank, they couldn't even do well a system they copied from every other mmo
---
1. Sure, you can like or dislike whatever, but that's not the issue with this community. Or at least I don't think it works like that. It's more polarized, and doesn't even focus on whether content was good or not. It's the specifics of the reddit, you don't see people who just like the game on here. There are two factions, people who want this game to improve (I'm one of them, so this will be most probably biased as fuck) so we bitch about bad quality of storytelling, no proper raids, the fact that the last fractal was released a year ago and we've just heard that raids and fractals are supposedly not anywhere near the top of the priority list, not to mention the fact that we haven't had a CM fractal in July 2017. That's over two years without any significant upgrade to 5 man endgame content. The last raid wing we got was boring for veterans, and still impossible to beat for casuals (because \*everything's great in 5 man content, 5 man content, nanna\* and raids suck because those are too elitist), we basically see the game dying in front of us, Anet focusing on the bottom line who will be happy to log in once in two weeks to check out new skins in gemstore (because they won't even read patchnotes and then wonder what's happening) and are more or less content with the game. I am not saying it's bad per se, but out of those people stem our beloved white knights, who will defend Anet not matter what. I admit, I don't see any value to their arguments, primarly because I think the game is in such a bad state that if you're happy with it, you don't harbor feelings strong enough as to go to reddit and argue about it with other people. If you like gw2 you just play it two hours a week and are content. 
---
2. Here I think that actually my side of the conflict is at fault. Casuals are happy that they have something  to do, hardcore players woe that there has been no changes to wvw (not counting gliders and warclaw, but actual big changes) in years, and people have been waiting for the alliance rework (and here correct me if I'm wrong) at least 3 years. In pvp it's similar, but not exactly the same. In pvp you have had broken rank system for a long while, there are bots, there's wintrading, there are matches where 3 ppl from top 100 can be matched with people from low gold. But at least you're getting new maps, which I can't elaborate about because I don't play pvp, just not my cup of tea. Finally you have hardcore players, who, as I said in point 1, haven't seen any meaningful changes in years, the last truly good and positively received additions being W5 and 100CM. On the other side you have casuals, who are happy that they've got half a map (a quite pretty half a map, but that's not the point here), and that there are new sounds and whatnot, the map is simply good if you want to just walk around searching for spots where you can take a screenshot. But the thing is that they have two teams working on LS releases, and yet those end up underwhelming. And even though they have two teams they have so few people working exclusively on wvw, pvp, and endgame pve that a Vietnam vet who lost his hands to a grenade would be able to count them on his fingers. 
---
3. There's also one more point you didn't mention. There's an utter lack of communication from Anet. The last two posts we've got from them (the ones about wvw and pvp balance feedback) were the first posts this year they actually communicated. On streams valid questions are ignored while they answer who's their favorite quaggan. Forums are heavily moderated so that you can get a warn/ban for saying something is shit or is in a dire need of improvement, I think the most prominent example of that was when ascended armor was released, any critique towards it would be deleted because 'we want to keep the discussion positive' (or it wasn't ascended armor? I'm not sure, again, correct me if I'm wrong). 
---
So, basically, we have this schizm because there are people who are the bottom lane and are happy with just about anything, and who have white knights defending new content with great arguments like "mate, it's free, stop bitching and be happy it's free" or "who cares build templates are broken as fuck and there's no communication about those beyond "we hear you and we will consider your feedback ^(but we'll ignore it, as fixing it would take too much resources from coding new skins for gemstore and our bottom lane uses one build anyway,') you wanted it for so many years, so stop crying," and people who genuely want some fucking change for their respective gamemodes, because if you're in endgame and you play gw2 the way an mmo is supposed to be played - as one of your main hobbies, not a game you play on the side, the game is stale.   
---
So we have people who want change and blame those who don't for giving Anet a reason to act the way they do now, and casuals who are more or less vocal about their appreciation for the game (Which is a truly good game, with thousands of hours of content, the problem is that most of the 'for change' people, just like me, have those thousands of hours of playtime under their belts.)

Point, counterpoint. Point, counterpoint. That's a discussion. The way most people on this sub talk is more like 'I hated/liked this thing' with a response like 'You are wrong for hating/liking that thing and are killing the game.' And then the name calling starts. And then people get angry.
---
Not healthy.
---
Denouncing racists is only irrelevant to racists ... Go back to stormfront ...
---
it appears so. hyperbole is easier to defend as ignorance and/or stupidity than outright lies about how the story isn't trash
---
Doesn't the 15min timer reset every time you pick up another matching orb
---
Oh shit now I see the similarity, been a while since I watched Star Wars and they looked different in my head.
---
Can't wait for the crossover episode.
---
&gt;  and a character's death has to completely match their level of heroism or accomplishments in life and be a real send-off.
---
You mean if we expect anet to have even the slightest modicum of competent writing?
---
You do realize this is supposed to be an engaging story and not real life right? Writing conventions like characters having sendoffs exist because they work toward making a more engaging and intresting story. Character arcs, introductions and sendofs exist because they make for better stories. 
---
"Its how it happens in real life".
---
Ok. So? This is not real life, this is supposed to be a story that's created by writers. Real life is not attempting to tell an engaging story for the benefit of its watchers. Anet is.
---
It wasn't creepy, dark or depressing though, it was just stupid. Unceremoniously killing off characters for no other reason other than to pretend stakes exist doesn't create atmosphere, and neither do "creepy whispers" (which are the most cliche thing ever) and doubly so when we all know who they're coming from, triply so when even the characters in the story do.
---
&gt; I was hoping that the boneskinner would tie in as a really haunting and deadly foe but that didn't happen which was a shame and wasted potential.
---
There's still a Strike Mission Boneskinner coming up, at least
---
God I hope not, beyond being questionably good they’re tedious to charge up. They should have been everything you kill charges you and gives you a buff but if you want the big BIG buff get all to 30 stacks that way everything happens naturally rather than constantly having to go out of your way to find specific mobs.
---
if it's egg free then it isn't raw cookie dough, it's imitation raw cookie dough.
---
Now I see it too)
---
Thanks for the feedback. Only time I play thief is rifle kiting at Qadim1, so I am not that into the synergies. I see that it works better with the other traits, especially Quick Pockets fit double pistol better. I will change the build.
---
Ranger feels like there's no real ability rotation. You want do damage one person more? Rapid Fire. You want to damage a whole bunch of people? Barrage. There's no other damage method really. You in danger? *Delete* aggro by stealthing. You want to cancel something? Knock them back. Just such a shallow playstyle imo.
---
Warrior just doesn't work for me. I can't help but feel like the absolute lunatic overly toxic masculine eyes bulging screaming at the top of his lungs madlad flailing his sword at someone to kill them. It doesn't matter what I do or how I play, just the colors of my abilities being red/orange/yellow, more or less the colors representing straight up violence is either too edgy, cliche or comical for me to take seriously.
---
Which is probably why I'm able to adopt the Guardian so well. They're more loyal/faithful soldiers who fight for others but can still hold themselves alone well. You're the frontline protector who is always willing to put yourselves in harms way for your allies/teammates. I mean, this is pretty much the role I mained in every single other game I've ever played.
---
Besides, putting down banners remind me of a champion from League of Legends, Jarvan IV who has an ability that plants down a flag with a minor attack speed buff. I have nothing against him, but he is absolutely the pompous stoic warrior cliche.
---
I just hit the training dummy with a 16k Weakening Charge on my daredevil and a 39k Spirit Nova, it looks like really good DPS to me. Plus, it activates my Sigil of Impact after.
---
I main as a norn and at the very end of the second mission you say a line that's both poignant and REALLY relevant to their race. Humans and Sylvari (and probably Charr and Asura too, haven't tried yet) get a much more generic one. That detail is super nice - and there are other smaller race-relevant touches too. The writing for this ep was excellent, even if the overall content is...debatable. :)
---
Pocket Boneskinners
---
Its just the flavor and texure, not actual batter/dough.
---
It's not just the lead-up to PoF that I thought they fudged up. It was how they handled the shining blade, mursaat and our much awaited character's return, Livia. All things people were excited about that really fell flat.
---
But my suspicion is that this is the result of fan-service to vocal whiners. They very likely wanted to deliver this stuff in their raid story arch and then crammed it into the living world poorly after people cried that White Mantle had to be a main story thread.
---
To remind us that arenanet does not think things through sometimes
---
&gt;Anet does a good job at conveying grief and emotion
---
I do agree. I'm sure we're all familiar with the feelings we get when playing against Condi Thief.
---
Hard to do when the nearest is at least a 3h drive away. We used to have one closer but it closed 5 or 10 years ago.
---
I think someone else is more like Jessica Price than Tom
---
Thank you for your earnest reply.  I do want to, briefly, address the fact that there are people who like to troll others and “neg” them.  These people are ones who cannot be reasoned with and it serves no purpose engaging with them in any way, shape, or form.  Once you do, they’ve won (and it’s why I’m usually hesitant to make a thoughtful, meaningful comment when someone poses a question).  It’s also the price we pay for being so connected globally, all voices, kind or cruel, are amplified.  It’s the unfortunate state of things that they have the freedom to express sentiments, regardless of how shitty it is to someone else personally.  For my part, I try to ignore individuals like that (and in my case that also applies to 80% of my extended family, THANK YOU VERY MUCH AUNT KAREN).
---
We are the product of our times.  There is so much anxiety and depression exhibited by people today because the future we were promised, one of success and wealth, was shown to be a lie, an illusion.  And we are suffering because of this.  Told we are being lazy, selfish, or undeserving.  Of course that’s going to affect our mental health and how we interact with others.  We have groups and organizations that tell us to “believe” them and not to think for ourselves.  They’ll do it for us.  Many don’t realize that these people, orgs, and groups don’t have our best interests at heart.  
---
The crazy thing is that we, *generally* as people in society, prefer to hold on to the familiar and safe.  We want to be right.  What has happened is that people have, again *generally*, retreated to “echo chambers” or are divided starkly by group lines, e.g. supporters or defenders of something and those who are extremely critical.  
---
Which is exactly what we’re discussing here about a video game/entertainment product.
---
Instead of engaging in meaningful conversation people look for “zingers” and sound bites.  They want to “win” arguments instead of improve the topic being discussed.  It’s poisoned discourse in society to the point where even trying to have the conversation and result in violence, physical or mental.
---
Which I maintain is the result of hyper-consumerism being ingrained as a belief and value system.
---
Those who have been told to parse every facet of life as *value extraction* will view the world through this lens.
---
The reality is I will agree with you on some things and disagree on others.  This is natural, normal.  Our unique experiences are what shapes the way we make decisions.
---
What is missing today, in my opinion, is the power of empathy and looking beyond oneself.  Various influences are at play, including the ever widening wealth disparity, and society, in general, has retreated into tribalism.  Winning at all costs.  A kind of social-survival acting as an extension of basic survival.
---
I’m glad I could help you in seeing different ways in which we can interact with others.  I hope more people are able to do this in the future.  I, too, make mistakes but endeavor to *be better*.  Everyone has bad days.  I will snap at others and be passive aggressive.  Other days I will be extremely kind and understanding.  It’s important to acknowledge these things.  
---
Admitting mistakes is not a weakness, it’s called *growth*.
---
I want to supporter my fellow laborers and workers, people like me trying to get by and not succeeding at the exploitation or suffering of another.  You will see me call for unionization a lot in my posts!
---
This is very abstracted from the actual discussion of GW2 (and even games in general).  But if you look you can see these same forces at play just about anywhere, on the surface of any topic.
---
We all feel passionately and strongly about various things, especially things that bring us joy.  GW2 has brought me joy in the past and I wish it continued to do so.  This could be like trying to reconcile with an ex who never really changed and it’s only the comfort of routine familiarity that keeps us together.
---
Ignore those who just want to be cruel to others.  They should not be engaged and don’t actually care about the topic (or if they do they certainly could learn some tact).  Do your best to recognize when someone is trying to express and opinion in earnest but lacks the eloquence others may have.  Most of all, remember that people who take the time to levy criticism, even against something you enjoy or brings you joy, are doing so because they *care* and want to feel the same joy/happiness/contented-ness you do.  
---
A thousand people will have a thousand differing opinions, but many times a middle ground can be reached that will please everyone involved.  If not, time will end up healing wounds.  People will move on to other hobbies and experiences.
---
Everyone has their own emotional journey and I try to keep this in mind in any interaction I have.
---
Also good for WvW and decent in SPvP. Guardians can’t go wrong.
---
Learn what exactly? It has no use outside opening chests...
---
Glad you enjoy it. Based on feedback I changed a traitline for even more boons and better initiative management. Refresh the page.
---
Yeah, the shining blade stuff really deserved its own episode where it isn't rushed and contrived because they are the deus ex machina to find Balthazar in a hurry.
---
If you go the the OFFICIAL release page, it even says "s5e1" in the title.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/the-game/releases/november-19-2019/
---
So yeah, same old.
---
&gt;I once heard from a wise man, “if you don’t like the \[content of this subreddit\], move on to something different”.
---
How saying "if you don't like the \[content of this game\], move on to something different" any different?
---
And they start with engage skills.
---
Luckily for us, they do not have the masteries, or they'll end a player in 3 hits.
---
Honestly, I don't like the italics either (wow, that sounds wrong). I removed it.
---
If youre looking for hardcore content you should keep in mind that this is a game where release dates between raid wings are about once a year on average and fractals ( which are about the equivalent of dungeons) are released about 2-3 times a year if that
---
Anet tries to make everyone happy. Never turned out great.
---
Nah, quickness beam's still useful on Reaper.  Even if you could camp shroud again (which you *can't*) for quickness, it's still useful for blasting a line of mobs when Death Spiral's on cooldown.
---
Another sissy whine thread. How amusing /facepalm
---
It's just an attempt to get away from the stigma around season episodes. Things like "yay wait 3 months for 1 hour of content" that are just not true, but are associated with season releases.
---
Ultimately, everything comes down to communication and expectations.  That's the main bottleneck.  Every so often ArenaNet will say something and for one reason or another it gets cut.  It may have been an awesome idea, but certain constraints; whether we're talking time, resources, QA vs. bugs (eg; open world Boneskinner) break the hype &amp; excitement. 
---
"Content for everyone," tends to prioritize casual, open-world/story and achievement focused players.  People that do more competitive or skill-demanding content whether we're talking PvP/WvW or Fractals/Raids ... feel abandoned.  Y'know I finished Fractal God about ~ 6 months ago, and I genuinely feel like ArenaNet considers Fractals &amp; Raids a "finished product."
---
They seem to think that they'll be unable to top 99cm &amp; 100cm so they don't bother trying.  They're willing to innovate and to work on merging communities such as with Strike Missions, but then they also consider things like challenge motes, which That_Shaman has data_mined, and rule them out because they're afraid of backlash from other player audiences.
---
"Content for everyone isn't content for me," because ArenaNet prioritizes the "global" experience over the experiences and challenges that forge better teamwork, new friends and new communities.  The game isn't dying, but it *is* slowly bleeding in certain communities and as a result the game has become increasingly insular as the average skill level drops.  
---
I don't necessarily dislike achievements, but ArenaNet isn't really carving out a sufficient niche for players that value skill-progression and teamwork in their "content for everyone," such as Strike Missions.  They *could* introduce challenge motes with some unique rewards or currency (eg; cosmic essences) that incentivize and motivate players to care, but they don't? 
---
Whether it's out of insecurity, apathy, spite or an "unwillingness to divide the community," (something they've already done with the sheer introduction of competitive content, fractals and raids in their game) it feels like they've carved out this niche for skill-progression and competitiveness in GW2 and a lot of us feel like an after thought.  
---
* **"We'll add a new Fractal or a Raid into the game *when* we can,"** 
---
#VS 
---
* *"We'll add a new story chapter, new achievements and a new living story map into the game every 2-3 months. 
---
It's increasingly difficult to take people seriously when they're disproportionately receiving consistent, higher quality content that meets their expectations and gives them long-term goals such as the Reforged Boreal Weapons set.
---
Then when our communities start breaking down (something casual players often don't see) when our AT Statics, WvW raids, Fractal Groups &amp; Raid Statics start falling apart we get told not to be frustrated because there ***is*** CONTENT.
---
I ask thee a question: ***What is "content" when you have no one that you want to play it with?***   
---
Lots of long-term players don't really want to suffer through socialization characterized by clunky ineptitude.  Like, I'm sorry, but trying to do normal T4 Fractals for me now? For example, last night I did them with some friendly pug folks and I played Healbrand, but I almost immediately regretted it because their damage required that I heal for what felt like ***eons***.
---
I can make excuses for people that I'm friendly or have guild relationships with, sure.  However, when I'm pugging content like Fractals or ~~Raids~~  seeing that people don't value my time enough to put some "after-thought" ^/s into their rotation? 
---
It just feels terrible.  So, while I'll suffer through the rest of the run and they'll compliment everyone on completing a "smooth" run I'll feel like hanging myself; and that's why people move to games like Path of Exile, Final Fantasy XIV or other such single-player or co-op games.
---
When using the roller beetle if there where trees, with the fog it felt like a horror movie drive in the woods
---
Back in the early raiding days, before Guardian greatsword got buffed to the levels it is nowadays, I started raiding on sword/scepter + shield DH. The DPS was not that great but you could easily reach around 14/15k on VG/Gorse and the shield utility was amazing to push back seekers, protect from Sloth slublings and overall provide clutch aegis.   
---
It's an easy build to play for this Strike mission and will make a party's life much easier so I can only upvote it!
---
&gt; TP watch scripts
---
That's called the official GW2 API, developed by arenanet. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main
---
Yesyes, blame the TP barons, because they actually learnt to use it for its intended purpose.
---
Lt. Daaaaaan
---
I also don’t want to be negative about them adding new mechanics like this, because sometimes they are interesting. I like, for example, using reactive abilities on some bosses in older releases (can’t remember when they introduced that), but these abilities/buffs seem a lot like the buffs from Siren’s Landing. After a very short while, I just don’t care to bother with them. 
---
On the other hand, the raven shield/buffs on the level work fine. They seem a little less obscure, because they are a less tedious mechanic.
---
There is an enraged cook in one of the camps. Defeat him.
---
Technically it's the raw flour that has the salmonella risk.
---
Explore more of the first instance before leaving.
---
hahaha holy shit, your attempts at getting attention from them by constantly pinging them for *months* is pathetic
---
your entire reddit history is being some racist gamer obsessed with trans people
---
and unlike ben shapiro you're not even getting paid for all of this, you're literally wasting countless hours of your time posting dozens of paragraphs on reddit every day while whimpering "d-debate me" at other people who have much better ways to spend their limited time on earth
---
defeat the enraged cook, he appears in one of the svanir camp
---
Is this going to be the next level of mount racing? Would be nice players vs npc in mount racing haha
---
Kill a chef in one of the open world camp events.
---
Thanks for the response! I can understand narratively why putting that part in the open world makes sense. You don't really expect something like that to happen outside of an instance, so there's moment of "wait, what? No..." that worked really well. So I just wanted to compliment you all on that idea, I *do* think it worked.
---
But unfortunately what followed wasn't very immersive, and that was frustrating because she is one of my favorite characters.
---
Any reason why youre taking kindled zeal over zealous blade for DH
---
No thats Raven's Lens Scholar.
---
That's interesting, I'd have to look into that. I'm sure whatever they use to create those edible "raw" cookie dough things are supposed to be safe for consumption. 
---
Either way the point I was trying to make is that there's a difference between something being bad by any set of reasonable standards and something not being a person's taste. Treating a character death with fanfare and spectacle vs. unceremonious harshness is a matter of what kind of story you want to tell, and both can be executed poorly or well depending on how the rest of the story elements are approached.
---
No, but im 1/64th black and i know what discrimination feels like because other black people consider me white and they discriminate against me.
---
Destroy food supplies (bunch of boxes) in one of the Svanir camps, it'll spawn the veteran cook you need to defeat.
---
Some form of combat mastery after character fully dies. It should provide less effective combat skills (and with time limits) than player would normally have,  but it should be useful nonetheless. Obviously only for group events. 
---
**Tier 1** Reinforced Soul. - You can fight as a spirit after death.
---
**Tier 2** Soul Calibur - You gain new utility skills in your spirit form. Your stuns and dazes deals 200% more damage to breakbars but exaust your soul energy.
---
** Tier 3** Dark Soul - You can enter spirit form without being fully defeated. Gain elite skill.
---
I just see them as extra toys/tools. One of the best items in the game is the Xera portal, this one item adds a ton to the game just by allowing for interesting portal strats, new ones being found out all the time. In most cases, it doesnt really add much (similar to mounts, who ultimately cares if they get somewhere quicker, they werent going to stop and smell the roses anyway), but it now creates new trick to the game (ex. Spring launching or skyscale.)
---
Why didn't you just say that in the thread? xd
---
Creature specific sigils are, honestly, worthless and never should have been a thing to begin with.
---
I mean we had a way to carry casual players -- chaos Chrono with distort sharing and initial version of signet of inspiration 😁 
---
But NPCs throwing up rgb land of bauble babbels is the thing we get :(  cause otherwise raids become strike missions
---
Cute lil' Charr
---
I can say with certainty, if you gain xp if your xp bar is maxed out it will automatically give xp to other unlocked XP-bars of other masteries of the same type (tyria xp will only work for tyria masteries), so lets say you have 0 tyria masteries and you are currently on fractal mastery, you will gain xp until your xp bar of pact commander, fractals and legendary crafting is full even if you dont switch which mastery you are training. All xp gained after that is wasted
---
&gt;there were plenty of posts about how it affected people. 
---
And there were plenty of posts mentioning how bad it was that she died and theorizing she would resurrect immediately.  
---
Funny how you tried to conveniently ignore that to push a fake narrative that this subreddit was impacted by it.
---
The very reason we wont get them is because Anet is not working on them at all.
---
On the NA raid discord someone theorycrafted a Harrier Deadeye build using sword/dagger x/pistol. Shadow Arts, Deadly Arts, Deadeye. It works surprisingly well because you heal everytime you use sword 2 and you can give a lot of boons with multiple stolen skills.
---
Yes. they're just rebranding living story. Nothing has changed.
---
Yeah, I've seen it. Was a wow moment for me. Sadly, there was a zerg all over it..
---
if they had any intention they'd find a way. but especially after what they delivered on tuesday nobody should have any hopes in that regard anymore. not that there was much hope in the first place, especially after their "it's on the table" comment regarding specs.
---
Its on the table.
---
They did that back in season 2, how is that experimenting?
---
I mean you may not care, but if they seal it up so people can't do it, they miss out lol
---
Honestly the Prplouge was good to me, well since, fairly expansive and neat...Episode 1 within 2 months, half the map, I do feel like they are splitting the difference between Season 2 and 3/4 Where we will be getting smaller maps and story fragments but a bit faster. I'm not thrilled at the moment but I do feel like it will depend on how they work on the general release cadence and the luje.
---
I’m afraid it’s a forgone conclusion we won’t get elites this season/saga. 
---
I hope I’m proven wrong.
---
&gt; hahaha holy shit, your attempts at getting attention from them by constantly pinging them for months is pathetic
---
No, I just want a response for their support whitewashing. He seemed so righteous right up until I brought sources in.
---
 But where's all that righterousness gone now?
---
&gt;your entire reddit history is being some racist gamer obsessed with trans people
---
&gt;and unlike ben shapiro you're not even getting paid for all of this, you're literally wasting countless hours of your time posting dozens of paragraphs on reddit every day while whimpering "d-debate me" at other people who have much better ways to spend their limited time on earth
---
\&gt;unironically posts in chapo trap house
---
Lemme guess, you use reddit as an outlet for your rage against people with jobs?
---
They could put elite specs unlocks behind strike missions for example. Plenty of ways to do it.
---
My fear is they scrapped them, and recycled the assets and into skill balance updates. Don't forget the ridiculously flashy effects they added to Thief traps for seemingly no reason. Why? 
---
It's a waste of developer resources to create an entire new skill type and new animation systems just to rework thief traps. As it is, ArenaNet makes a big god damn deal about fixing legendary armor that they still haven't done it after four years. So imagine how difficulty it must've been to create the traps rework, unless they had some purpose in mind that went scrapped.
---
Leave the cooks alone!!!! Haven't you done enough already? ;;
---
Look whats next. White ball moves into raids.
---
Yeah, more people is actually bad in my experience so far because not enough people CC during that phase.  So far I've only seen it killed once before nabbing people, with a much smaller group.
---
Thank you for this....makes it so much easier to remember!  RGB
---
That's called the internet or really life in general *looks at both congressional parties*
---
Try harder if you want to keep responding. Goal is to entertain me.
---
Thx
---
Yeah I'm sure one day we'll have an epiphany about why miss Beetlerun died in a cutscene. It's certainly part of a greater scheme and will resonate through the very fabric of a future episode. It certainly wasn't a case of "well I've no idea what to do with her if her dad's dead, and we didn't know how to use her in any plot before anyway".
---
Can't wait for more death in a cutscene, it's a wonderful trope.
---
I've mentioned both shutting down and sell multiple times. My comments have been about alternative options that the company has compared to listening to constant complaints. Not one vs the other. 
---
In terms of "who would buy a 7 year old mmorpg?" I again point you to Jagex and runescape being sold almost a decade after it was created. So clearly a market there.
---
It's not smarter to start your own game because of the mass amount or resources required to start up. The company's that would buy this arent interested in maintaining or making the game better, they would be in it to make a quick buck by milking the consumer for as much as they can then liquidating the company. (They could even move money out of the company into personal funds and declare bankruptcy to clear their debt, a shady tactic used in the US all the time unfortunately) 
---
In terms of indemnizations (which my phone is not convinced is not a word, but I know what your talking about), that is really just dependent on the employee contracts. Couldn't really tell you. What I do know is that if Anet is sold the contracts could be upheld for a period of time. (And again, declaring bankruptcy is a way out to mitigate this too) 
---
In terms of my english comments, I am sorry about that. I did not recall reading anything in this thread about english as your second language, and you're right the insults are unnecessary, however they came from both sides so let's just call that a wash. 
---
It's clear we can't find some common ground on this so let's just end it here. Well just see what happens to Anet in the future. Only time will tell.
---
and just who is your target audience? People who not aware of gravity? "I died last time I jumped off a cliff, maybe it won't happen this time"
---
What about Minstrel Mesmer with Monk runes and heal food? Shits out a ton of heal while stacking all the alacrity and quickness a group needs.
---
I'm going to be honest: This release was not impressive at all. It's humiliating.
---
Skinning the launcher but not character select looks *bad*. Like it were rushed out the door, or developers simply didn't give a shit. (It may vary depending on the dev you ask.)
---
This would not fly in other games. But we in the GW2 community have grown accustomed to mediocrity. For example: the devs desperately try to imitate quests through collections, but fail horribly with an obtuse interface mess that don't even afford them unique NPC dialogue as you progress, but just an inventory checklist buried in UI. That shit would not fly in any other game, it wouldn't even be acceptable in GW1. But we in GW2 have accepted that as the norm.
---
This may sound like a negative take on the state of GW2, but it's important to frame things in the greater context of things. Their refusal to just do things the way a normal game is supposed to do make people outside our community think: "Hah, GW2! OMEGALUL"  and "GW2 is still alive???"
---
The lack of new elite specs and lack of new character select is just one more example of things outside our community that the rest of them laugh at us for.
---
Of course, I'm not going to hold it personally against ArenaNet. They *are* just recovering from layoffs. But that's not a consideration for anyone outside our community. GW2 remains a joke to others.
---
Hello telemarketer, this is AT&amp;T. Please get off Reddit and pay your late phone bill immediately.
---
Money does not care about "we found it cool".
---
Think in terms of investment and profits. How many hours were spent making those effects? Testing them?  
---
How much did it truly cost? How much did ArenaNet get out of it?
---
Someone has not ever played a Norn.
---
*breathes* 
---
Ok so Aesgir Dragonrender is a famous Norn warrior who confronted Jormag after it awoke and tried to fight it. He wasn't the first Norn to try but he was the first to succeed in some way. We know he used an ancient fire ritual to enchant his weapon to give himself a fighting chance, and in that fight he broke a tooth from Jormag's mouth. This spot must have been where that fight happened. Aesgir then returned to the Norn and, with the guidance of the spirits of the wild, led the Norn south and established the great lodge of Hoelbrak. 
---
Legend says that if another warrior comes along and breaks the tooth, they will be the one to lead the Norn to battle against Jormag again, triumph, and return the Norn to their ancestral homeland.
---
This map reveals additional details, but that is the short version.
---
I have to agree, maybe I expected to much but hey made it sound like it would be part of the story.
---
I was semi afk up a tree earlier in the forest, a good 30 feet or so up, and next minute the boneskinner is yeeting me out of the tree, it was terrifying. I don't know who was more alarmed though, me or the zerg below who saw a norn fall out of said tree and die. So yeah, TIL boneskinners can climb trees. Freaky little buggers.
---
Man u don't know racism until you are a white german-italian with 1/64th black.
---
Not a mastery/mechanic exactly but i would want a QoL feature that allowed me to autocollect everything from my home instance. Just for my home instance map. With more and more nodes being added it's becoming quite a chore. Maybe it could be an auto-mail that was delivered to me when i go into my homs instance or something along those lines.
---
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
---
You said there's no marketing, which this game has actually had issues with in the past. 
---
To which I then (completely rationally, to me) thought "Oh maybe he hasn't seen any of the ads that they've been putting out lately". Which I thought was understandable because a lot of people use adblockers (myself included). So I informed you you about some ads that I've seen lately for the game.
---
To which you condescendingly implied that I don't know that personalized ads exist while describing it incorrectly. 
---
To which I explained that it doesn't work like that, because it doesn't. 
---
Then you respond with that absurd, wandering ramble and end it by asserting that *I'm* the pedant in this...?
---
Are you taking crazy pills? One of us is definitely taking crazy pills, and I can only be certain of the conclusion that *I'm* not taking any.
---
There were plenty of both posts. The existence of one doesn't negate the existence of the other. I didn't try to deny the existence of theory posts, I just didn't bring them up but I should have because they only go further to prove my point that it did have an impact on the community. The fact that people were theorizing meant it was impactful enough to make them theorize and post those theories. You say it had no impact but the evidence clearly says differently. 
---
Nice strawman you got there. Be a shame if somebody ignored it and just stuck to the actual argument.
---
Well, thanks for being frank about your intentions, at least.
---
At some point, you have to teach players to apply the game's existing mechanics well, instead of short-circuiting the mechanics; otherwise, you will hit a plateau of viable content, and people who need more variety and challenge as time goes on will simply leave.
---
The only issue I have with the map is that it has jack for rewards. Sitting in the meta for 20 min only to get EXP for 1 out of 10 mobs and maybe a roll for a random T5 mat on the bomber is really underwhelming. Once I got my Masteries, I just left the map to let it pile up in snow while I find something else to do.
---
Give me a reason to stay on your map.
---
Patience may be a virtue but I don't many people in this community trait for virtues :p
---
Works too of course. My thought was someone that has a minstrel gear will propably not need this post, so I did not focus on builds like harrier druid, minstrel fb, minstrel chrono.
---
They only use them when following you which I consider just a gameplay thing(they need to keep up with the player character) as opposed to,  actually acknowledging that they exist in the GW2 universe. Like you never see Braham or Rytlock name their raptors or even acknowledge that they have one. None of the NPCs in Lions Arch or any major city use them either. Outside of a very few areas in PoF, mounts are never referenced. Which is weird to me considering they spent so much time on developing plotlines for gameplay mechanics, like waypoints.
---
Hey friend,thanks for the answer,but i got a little bit lost here.
---
so,i download the (free) game,if i want,i buy the expansions later,and even so,after that i still have this Living World expansions? What are those?
---
Great to see stuff like this popping up for the new releases!
---
Maybe you wanna consider collaborating with the people from [gw2fans.net](http://www.gw2fans.net), who are also trying to fill the void dulfy left in the guide landscape :)
---
Yeah during the snowstorm getting close made him disappear but after during clear skies he didn’t go away.
---
I wouldn't want to be pulling a thing that big and pointy downhill, on ice, behind me...
---
Well with mounts Anet lost the ability to create horrifieng open world areas, not that they ever have done that before
---
I meaaaan ... Even CM or not super micro intensive. It's just pattern recognition. That's a tad harder in PvP imo. Although it does play a role too.
---
Highly depends on your internet speed and character build you play. But as a full DPS it took me an hour or so to complete the new story. Most of that was, sadly, a silly follow-12-map-markers parts with a bunch of roleplaying exposition
---
which they rushed to make it, didn't even bother changing the buttons and progress bar
---
I've already started to remember that Abberant is Green, Svanir is Blue, and Fallen is Red. I have no idea what the associated names are for those masteries. I think Valor is green. The biggest takeaway I have is that, for the sake of efficient communication, absolutely no one will use their RP names to list them just like how no one uses Zojja or Yassith or any of the other ascended prefixes. 
---
Is it not possible to just fill up on your 15 minutes for each color by using the pedestals at the keep? If so then it almost feels trivial to have 30 stacks pretty frequently. Even then I don't find myself using them except for breakbars.
---
&gt; Giving a release date a week ahead after a 4 month wait is not a "scedule". Its a heads up.
---
I never said that those dates are what constitutes a schedule. That was addressing your factually incorrect claim "They never gave proper release dates".
---
The thing that constitutes a schedule is "every 3-4 months". 
---
&gt; You're saying "They gave us a headsup a week ahead after 4 months of silence, that counts as a scedule 
---
technically." and you get pissy when accused of semantics?
---
There you go saying things I didn't say again. I also haven't got "pissy" this whole time, so I don't know what you're talking about with that. I just keep having to correct you when you keep dismissing things as "semantics" when they aren't. I'm not angry about it or anything. Sorry if it came across that way.
---
No, that's not what counts as a schedule, nor did I say that it does. What counts as a release schedule is "every 3-4 months". That means a minimum of 90 days, to a maximum of 120 days.
---
&gt; And I called the measurable quality of content objective... because it is.
---
Oh. I didn't realize you were talking about if it functions correctly as intended. I thought you were taking about if the content was enjoyable and satisfactory as a player and worthy of time and attention. You kept talking about "objective quality" but also bringing up things like if the content was good and worth it in regards to things like content quantity and length. Sorry for my confusion, I didn't realize that you weren't saying those as the same thing. 
---
&gt; You've used the word "subjective" about 50 different times whenever I bring up the fact that this is a low quality patch.
---
That's not at all what I asked for you to quote me on. You keep saying that I'm defending the content, when I haven't, and quoted me as saying "But i like having keys dangled in front of me, so its high quality entertainment". Those are the things I was asking you to proved a source for.
---
As for that other part I addressed above. It was a misunderstanding. You talked about objective quality and following up about the content being "shit" or too short etc. So I thought you were conflating the objectively measurable aspects with whether or not the content itself satisfactory.
---
&gt; "Whether we like it or not, is subjective." No, its not. 
---
Wait, what are you talking about? We already agreed on this. You literally just said this 2 posts ago:
---
&gt; whether or not you like the update is subjective.
---
What am I misunderstanding here?
---
&gt; ​"My scedule is from tommorow 5 years" Is also technically a scedule because it has a deadline.
---
See this is why its obvious you don't want to have a genuine discussion and you just want to harp on words.
---
What do you mean? This whole disagreement about "did they have a deadline" was started by you saying "that's not a schedule", and ever since then you keep saying that I'm the one that wants to make it about semantics. 
---
Here, so if we just drop the word "schedule" we'll agree then if that's just "semantics".
---
We can just put it like this then so that there's no confusion about the term "schedule":
---
1 You said that they haven't been on time with releases
---
2 They have openly had a recurring deadline of 4 months per episode for the past season consistently
---
3 The dates of releasing the episodes is within the 4 month recurring deadline for all episodes for the last 2 years aside from one which was 5 days past the 4 month deadline. Most of those were before the 4 month (120 day) deadline.
---
4 You were factually incorrect in your claim that they haven't been on time with releases
---
So we're good there? That was the entire point. Unless you have another semantic issue with "recurring deadline" or something.
---
&gt; See? More semantic bullshit. 
---
That is not semantics. Semantics would be arguing over word choice. That point is about logical consistency. You are claiming two things that are in direct contradiction with each other. They cannot both be true at once. You are claiming something that is false, and not in word choice and meaning. Then when I point that out, you keep incorrectly claiming that I'm arguing semantics to avoid just admitting that you were wrong. I don't understand why. It's not as if you're going to be harmed by it. I did it just fine by taking correction and fixing it when I realized I was incorrectly thinking that you were conflating objective functional quality with the subjective aspects satisfaction and worth when you said it was "shitty".
---
&gt; Meanwhile back on reality they still have no ability to actually maintain a proper release rate, but hey, semantic technicallities are gonna suddently make the content drought not exist, so congrats you fixed the game.
---
We both agree that they have consistently released content every 4 months, predictably, last season. You said it yourself at the start of this conversation. How is that not a maintained proper release rate? And now they stated that the new release rate will be every 2 months, which they have so far, albeit only one episode. However, we both agree that they have consistently hit recurring deadlines for the past 2 years, so I see no reason to believe that they won't hit this new one with the smaller content releases that they have announced.
---
How is a consistent, planned, release rate (by your own words and mine) with a recurring deadline a content drought? A content drought is when there is 0 content released or announced for long stretches of time. The last time that happened was between HoT and Season 3 when we had no idea when LW was coming back. Since then we have pretty much always had upcoming releases that were known to be coming through S3 which ended with the PoF teaser, which ended with the S4 teaser, which was followed by the tease of the announcement of Icebrood Saga, which began shortly after as they said. Now we just got a new release, and we know there is another episode coming in 2 months according to their stated recurring release date.
---
I don't know why you think I fixed the game... I haven't even discussed the many issues in the game, because that wasn't part of my disagreement and correction of your false claim. You kept going off the rails of the discussion on tangents about whether or not the content is good etc, and started a semantic argument about the word "schedule" I didn't bring any of that up. 
---
I have a suspicion that you're still somehow going to assert that I defended the content being good somehow though, just based on how this has gone thus far.
---
Hey there quick question:
---
Are the rewards for strike missions weekly or daily ? I Know they rotate weekly. 
---
Thanks !
---
&gt;I hope Anet hasn't already given up.  They need to turn around and realize that they can't have the reputation of a good and healthy game when it's most dedicated fans are so unsatisfied.
---
They just made separate teams to address PvE, PvP and WvW. That is direct evidence that they are not giving up. Also, the fans that are dissatisfied with the game aren't the only dedicated longterm players. I have played this game since launch and know many others who have that are very happy with the game. Don't make the mistake that the people who are dissatisfied are the only true fans.
---
Oh.. RIP
---
They got nothing out of it, they don't give a shit at this point and even thinking that ArenaNet scrapped new elites and just repurposed them is beyond wishful thinking.
---
It'll be in perfect position to hit fractals next
---
This is entirely Arenanet's fault. Doesn't matter what game you look at, this kind of attitude isn't really found anywhere else because pretty much every other mmo or live service game knows exactly what it wants to be and communicates this to their fans in addition to actually delivering content for their entire playerbase. 
---
Arenanet are the ones who caused this divide and they don't even seem to be aware that they have done it. They are the most out of touch company I have ever seen.
---
If they manage to stick to 2 months then it will be about the same as season 4. If they take longer than 2 months, it will be even worse, since you are basically getting half of what we used to get.
---
Every Thief Trap now has a unique symbol associated with itself on the ground.
---
You don't think the symbols had anything to do with anything? Just generic cool images?
---
What are you even talking about ?
---
Based on how they handled all metas post HoT, don't have high hopes for it.
---
"His bigotry and race-inflected narratives can’t be wished away, cherry-picked, or swept under the rug in favor of his more widely known literary techniques and accomplishments—especially as hell-bent right-wing insurgents proudly claim him as a true elaborator of reactionary horrors."
---
I don't need anymore political speak in my life. Stopped reading there. Sorry friend but some people just find politics disgusting. Stop insisting with this.
---
Or use the new mastery special abilities to blast off armor and make him vulnerable to the chains.
---
&gt;"something between dungeon and raid"
---
huh? its significantly less than a single dungeon, theyre simple boss fights that can easily be low manned
---
Strike missions (allegedly) are supposed to teach pleb how to work together in a group enviroment, *communicate* and form effective group compositions. Instead these builds are all about locking up in your own autistic shell, but still benefitting the people around you, even if involuntarely.
---
Nice effort, but this is so wrong tbh. And it isn't like those people are going to read this guide anyway.
---
Yeah, if they keep the cadence of 2 months I'd be ok with it, that's why I'm more waiting to see .
---
Now what would have been amazing is if we had to use the skyscale/griffin to take the chains and turn around his legs to make him fall!
---
You know it is a mount skin right?
---
The next a dps complains that I didn't stab or aegis the Gorseval smash I will tell him to leave his autistic shell.
---
the reason is simple: their resource management is so bad that they might be better off if it didn't exist in the first place.
---
Exactly. The worst part is the you rarely see any solutions offered, just vitriol. I have over the past few years have actually git the devs to change things by offering evidence and solutions. People just doing their best Gordon Ramsey impressions has never fixed anything.
---
Why dont you leave this sub then?
---
How does it remove the ability to cc when any class can do it
---
&gt;Also, all we got out of the entire episode was knowing where Balthazar went. Which was useless since we sat on our ass and did nothing about it until the elonian refugees hit LA.
---
Haha, that is totally true isn't it? We knew where he was but didn't do anything until it was Captain Kiel's problem and she lent us her airship.
---
Yeah, that's totally fair. I was worried about the player reaction to ep1 not being much/any longer than the prologue. I didn't even think about how bad the reaction would be if it were *shorter*.
---
The neck is too long for boneskinner
---
but my point is they dont have to add more hp's to the new maps. pof includes hot now so there is a total of 890 hp's to be found and another 14 in pvp/wvw
---
This engi build is TERRIBLE for instanced content. Flamethrower is a terrible weapon outside of tagging. You dropped the strongest modifier, modified ammunition, for some might. Scrapper trait + juggernaut don't even cap might. Just play strength sigil + runes for 16stacks of might + modified ammunition. 
---
Also just to spread how terrible flamethrower really is: Bombs with 0might do almost as much damage as flamethrower with 25 but if you take modified ammunition which is a 20+%mod bombs win hard or you could use hammer instead which is slightly less dmg than bombs but easier to play. But please dont bring a juggernaut build into instanced content ever.
---
AFAIK the only expansion exclusive content is e-specs.
---
Everything else we got in xpacs we also got in ls chapters.
---
2 years of waiting. No content in meantime means people are unhappy. So delivering stuff by smaller parts but over time looks like good compromise. This is not a game that would require you 4 months of **grinding** same content to actually finish it.
---
Writing isn't amazing but it's much better than most RPGs.
---
I mean if you only consider western rpgs its up there.
---
I'm talking about recently though, replayed a bit of season 2 recently and cringed a bunch.
---
[they can even hover](https://imgur.com/a/D19Yi94)
---
I first bought this game on physical dis  all the way back in 2012. I've been playing and loving Swtor but it lacks good end game content. I know I like this game but how is end game right now and is it worth getting into from Zero? I've seen a ton of negative comments about the current direction of the game so I'm unsure.
---
Thank you very much for this!!!
---
You are awesome and literally one of the few that keeps the game alive.
---
No content creators = dead game.
---
Keep up the good work my friend!!!
---
There’s so many examples of mounted NPCs, though. The asura who set up the mirrors in the dragonfall meta use springers. The Ohlmakan commonly use skimmmers. Some Cavaliers in Amnoon are riding around on raptors. That’s just three examples out of dozens. And even outside of PoF, there’s even a Mist Warrior in LA who rides a Warclaw.
---
Core Story gets awkward fast when you find out how many fully dead, otherwise unrezzable NPCs you can revive with revive skills like Warrior Banner
---
I noticed that too! Thought it was a nice little addition.
---
I mean well see? Anet pretty much always give weight to every deaths (when the characters stay truly dead..), just this release we still see the repercussions of Eir and Belinda's death.
---
Thank you for this!!! I Main guardian and if i may i would recommend scepter instead of sword for DH because it's easier to play!!!
---
&gt; The next time a dps complains that I don't stab or aegis the Gorseval smash  I will tell him to leave his autistic shell. 
---
No, you won't, because you have communicated with him (or at least it is implied in better groups) that you are going to give aegis and he is going to do better dps rotations, resulting in overall higher group perfomance.  This is the point of a group content, isn't it? Division of labour.  Shouldn't "stepping stones to raids" teach this? 
---
Instead yet again we going the way of minimizing player interaction. Again. Sigh.
---
That sounds like a joke that was fitting for those times where people were more ignorant of these problems you are speaking about. And read the prior article some more, but the writing style isn't for me tho.
---
But anyways, I understand where you are comming form, even tho I don't agree with your methods of busting out fun facts like these which are so unrelated to the subject that was discussed. I won't like to continue this chain any further, hope you will have an wonderful weekend!
---
There was just no way to leave for me. There was no leave instance button, since I was neither in a party nor in a squad, I couldn't leave those either. I couldnt respawn to leave trough the portal since the group was in combat and relogging didn't work either. Completly stuck until the boss was dead or the group wiped and didn't immediatly restart.
---
Whoa there buddy. Reasonable posts with rationale ideas aren't allowed here in these parts. That'll get ya downvoted in the public square faster than a tobacco chewer can spit.
---
Did the Caithe backstory mission and I was so mad at everything happening.
---
[Superior Sigil of Demon Summoning](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Demons) is what it was called, but was changed in the November 2018 rune and sigil overhaul to the Superior Sigil of Demons. The functionality of many such runes/sigils were changed.
---
I love your response! apologies accepted, and i also im sorry for insulting you in any way, it wasn't intended
---
i strongly agree with the last bit, but i must say you gave some very interesting arguments, like declaring bankruptcy, didn't thought about that
---
and also the runescape example was really good, even tho i belive you can't compare both games in terms of financial posibilites, because of the membership system, life span and playerbase, it's a good piece of evidence that the market is alive, i must agree that it may be possible that some gaming company buys the game just to put it in maintenance mode and profit from it
---
on the other hand i belive thats what anet is currently doing, with minimal updates and focus on monetization, thats why i wouldn't expect them to sell until they finish this process
---
anyway, i love when heated arguments change into an actual exchange of ideas, thank you for that! and have a good day sir!
---
Yes, unless they actively say otherwise.
---
So.....why the hell did it allow us to see Almorra AT ALL?
---
Maybe they havd started. This season will be 1 or 2 big, hopefully very complete maps, long lasting open world endgame. Then support mostly wvw/pvp and go for gw3.
---
In a sense, yes.  The idea is that this is basically an expansion released as a saga and its done more over time instead of all at once.  What it really looks like though is LS episodes with a few expansion-like features (ascended cooking and build templates) added in.  I'm not sure why they took this route instead of just making another expansion but my guess would be money.  Hype up and market the saga over a year or so versus 5ish months for an expansion.  The problem is that so far, it looks like the only additions for the saga will be living story and PvE related which really hurts the competitive side of the game or at least what's left of it.
---
When back to old season recently and my character was just destroying everything in 2-3 auto attacks. Holy hell it's like a different game.
---
Uuuh.. yeah that doesn't sound good. As mentioned, I wasn't happy with the build. I changed the build accordingly. Thanks for the feedback.
---
&gt;I have been playing and part of this community off and on since months after launch, I really like this game but going after people for not playing the same way you do, just does not help anybody. 
---
And yet it is perfectly understandable and normal. Just try to flip your PoV. People are annoyed and staying silent does nothing to alleviate that.
---
Which is true, but obviously the vast majority of the player base did not. Then there’s the other part of the player base who did catch that announcement but yet still felt disappointed. It’s not they don’t announce anything it’s just how they go about it. PR has never been their strong suit.
---
For example they could have updated the world map like the image from ThatShaman with text saying coming soon... or coming episode 2.. or even better including the month they are expecting to release it.
---
Are we ignoring the dolyak calf in the back?
---
It seems like it would be so much better if it just appeared in the distance, looking at you, and then disappeared, like the leyline anomaly thing. It just feels awkward when it slaps you and then goes away.
---
You cant use pedestals in keep. However you can use single pedestal in strike mission.
---
This system reminds me of the the secret world aegis system...in not a great way. A not clever system only there to exist to be a road block. If part 2 has mobs that can only be attacked by a color the 'crossover' will be complete.
---
Have a great weekend bro!
---
I had tons of fun discussing with u!!!
---
Me too!
---
Ohh so when you lose the credit for the ap being complete you lose the ap too. So you never go up it is just a battle of trying to keep it. Now im with you
---
That makes no sense, lore-wise.
---
Why raise and train cold-blooded creatures for use in winter climates? Wouldn’t warclaw or even jackals be better?
---
I haven't gotten to that yet, I think I'm in the middle of the first episode after the prologue. Honestly the main thing that seems really cringy so far is the two lesbians relationship. Now I have absolutely nothing against that in the slightest, it is just so fucking sappy and stupid for no reason and it isn't done with other couples in a relationship in the game. Both myself and my SO were just like "holy hell can you two shut the hell up so we can continue with this story?" It just completely killed any pacing.
---
**Path of Fire was officially announced around a month before it was released** and there were some "leaks" around 2 months before that, most of which anet DMCAed from youtube.   
---
That said I seriously doubt that they'll say, leak, mention or whatever anything about a possible expansion until the final stages of icebrood saga. **They haven't denied any future expansions**, quoting their words "**their focus right now is icebrood saga**"   
---
**Something they also said when bloodstone fen was released in 2016 and maintained until  flashpoint** (over 9 months). Where mounts were "leaked"   
---
Why they did it like that is beyond me, I can only speculate. So, just let it rest? **I'm not defending anet's marketing strategy, neither am I able to understand it, but We don't know if there's going to be an expansion or not.**   
---
Sadly, milking strategies like DLC-locked content, expansions, season passes and the like are mainstream in the western market thanks to the likes of EA and activi$ion, and I'm pretty sure that a billion $ company like ncsoft is aware of that, so don't discard a possible expansion just yet :P  
---
**Personally, I believe that anet is trying to apply a "new coke" on us, or a "sonic movie redesign" going by a more modern example.**   
---
"*we didn't plan to do anything, but our fans forced our hands and we're glad to comply!*"
---
I love how they like to reinforce and prove how right the comments are that this place is toxic via a stream of downvotes instead of...you know, NOT downvoting you and leaving you at 1 point instead to prove you wrong.
---
So tell me, do u believe that it was good story telling to murder Aurene, have entire missions dedicated to grieving her, and then just immediately bring her back the next ep. It literally killed any real significance that death has in this game. Are u actually trying to tell me that Aurenes death and immediate reincarnation was well done? It was almost laughably bad. Anet’s strong suit has never been writing or story lmaoooooooo.
---
Thanks for your map it looks great!
---
My main problem with them is the visual noise. All the enemies look ugly as sin (in a bad way) because of this awful mastery.
---
You are welcome :)

I think running adds is totally acceptable. All of us are benefiting from your hard work for free after all
---
Thank you. I would love to add in future some contests or lotteries or giveaways.

MIGHT not see? Well thats optimistic

Thank you for noticing. I will add it.

Ok I will add it tomorrow with pictures. I promise!

Lets say I play wvw, pvp and open world, and i have only 1 build for each game mode, before the release, we got a free hidden template for each game mode, thats why when i enter pvp lobby or a wvw map my build automatically changes (in wvw case only the traits ofc)
---
so now those hidden templates are gone, so i have to use my "free" templates, one for each game mode
---
that leaves me with no free template, im at the same spot i was before, so to actually have 1 template, i have to buy it, do you get it now?
---
It was a complete scam, because they never said wvw and pvp default templates would be deleted, players figured out themselves that, and im sure it was on porpouse because after templates release one of the bigges complains was this fact. So i'd bet they thought already about all of this.
---
Not sure if this belongs here but on the general note of creepiness, obvously this is done a lot who the sound. And it blows my mind watching those guild chats for the sound designers and what work they do with every day objects. However, i always find the sounds ingame conflicting with eachother.  
---
two issues ive found:  
---
\- Combat dialogue overwhelms other subtle effects that are on the same volume slider.
---
\- Critical story VA or NPCs that tell you a story that have been initated by the player, are drowned out by other NPCs in the area. Yes i love the dynamic event system but when youre in the moment trying to do your story, i think hushing all other nearby dialogue would be wonderful. though...i appreciate this might be an incredible amount of work to configure all previous content.
---
Talking about binge culture keeping us from waiting for the entire story is a real fucking joke considering the shitshow of a cliffhanger in season 4. All or Nothing was entirely pointless and nullified within the first 10 minutes of War Eternal is saying people should be more patient with how they read a story.
---
Guess what, Tom. The only reason people liked All or Nothing was BECAUSE they were being patient and thought this would lead to good storytelling, and it ultimately ended up being an extremely cheap attempt to tug the audience's heart strings when viewed in context with the full story.
---
This narrative team has absolutely no clue.
---
It’s insane how low people’s standards are for GW2 story. Ur literally saying  this episode had a lot of grief and emotion because of one voice line from Marjory. Think about how shallow that is lmao.
---
&gt; there hasn't been much difference in the content in HoT/PoF vs LWS3/4 other than length
---
PoF maybe. But HoT maps vs Living World? Really?
---
you must be mega bored,sadly the ppl which need this guide most,dont visit reedit.
---
Ignore the guy. He has been a miserable, salty pile of pettiness for years and will never have anything better to do than haunt the subreddits of games he hates just to shit on them on every occasion.
---
Errr... in HoT they certainly use mounts.
---
They have looked at the numbers and seen that the LS keeps enough of the community active... its a business decision...  Look at it like this... 
---
They can keep x% of the community engaged and do small content releases... aka the LS episodes all while adding gem store stuff and QoL to the game and keep it profitable enough to keep it going until it isnt.  And they have more time for balance and smaller changes to be made... they can much more easily address point issues within the game modes and focus on other game modes...  
---
Or
---
They can push and push and push to release content in big mainly PVE releases... aka expansions... that add more in the way of armor and weapon sets and elite specs but not really much more than a full season of living story other than it all being dumped at once... and watch the community bum rush it for 3 months and then lose y%  of the community because there is no fresh content...  All the while, they have to have twice the staff working on the expansion and a still have to have staff working on the episodes just to avoid the content drought.  Compound that with the fact that the expansions are massive and new elite specs makes for serious balance issues which we have all experienced...  So now you are playing catchup to fix the balance... and trying to add other QoL things become a lost cause...  timelines... business... marketing for the expansions is much more expensive...  So it doesnt really make business sense if the prior option is viable.  
---
So
---
We are already conditioned to not get elite specs in a LS... and even if they added them across the saga it would be much easier to balance since its one new one and then 2 or 3 months and would keep a huge part of the population playing because they are waiting for their new Elite spec to come for their favorite class... sux to be the 9th one though!
---
If Anet was smart they would tell us they are doing exactly that... even if its 2 per... or 3 per... they could extend the release timelines for each episode because "elite specs" and still have us on the hook for 1.5 more years...  rise repeat.
---
Those dino riding dudes in HoT zones also.
---
You can do the sanctum once per day per character that has finished the story, to get a new blessing i'm pretty sure your old one needs to have run out (correct me if wrong there).
---
sequence for invocation of midday is the options save the healer, get the book of dragons and save the queen.
---
supplication of midday sequence is save the warrior, get the book of tyria's past, save the prince.
---
Thank you for your support in this.
---
Thank you for noticing. It was fixed in guide.
---
and they even say that if feels like mordemoth :D
---
You are welcome I am glad to help.
---
Thank you!
---
You are welcome!

You must be new!

Asgir's been dead for a while. He led the Norn south to escape Jormag's corruption and bitter frost. In Season 3 Braham enchants his mother's bow with the same fire enchantment and cracks the tooth in Hoelbrak. He leads a guild of Norn north to fight Jormag, but our tampering with Omad's Machine in Draconis Mons sends Jormag into a slumber under a mountain of ice. Because Braham couldn't kill Jormag as was prophesied, he abandoned his guild and left. The tooth of jormag, known as the fang of the serpent, is still in Hoelbrak.
---
Aye aye captain!
---
Fun fact:capping a node goes faster by the amount of people so 2ppl cap faster than 1 ,BUT never ever is it worth to allocate 2 people for an uncontested node
---
You are welcome Ferril :3
---
You realize you get 10 points per HP in HOT and POF verse just 1 in core tyria right... so they could just change the formula...    
---
Mind BLOWN!
---
I fucking hope so!  I dont wanna carry 9 fucking scrolls when a tome can hold them...
---
IMO, the overall lore is great, and playing with the Elder Dragons as such an immediate and cataclysmic threat kind of limits where you can take the immediate story. I wish they fleshed out the Mists more, rather than using it as some Deus Ex Machina to tie up loose ends every now and then (especially since it doesn't really work and just leads to more plot holes).
---
You can also do every combination on one day if you replay the story instance eight times. Just relog after getting the achievement update and it'll put you in front of the story marker again.
---
I think it's more like the raptors were taken by Jormag just like their riders.
---
&gt; The next time a dps complains that I don't stab or aegis the Gorseval smash I will tell him to leave his autistic shell. 
---
woo press a button to an attack which has an animation of a lifespan save the world
---
When people like you play support all they do is spamming all their "useful" skills off cooldown, even when the group benefits nothing from it, and when the group needs it, the cooldown is still there. Try playing a dps class with a bunch of "supports" like you to see how it well works from the third person view.
---
&gt;It's a shame these finer nuances are lost to so many, though.
---
You people have NEVER read books or played other games, have you?
---
ew ew the wings...
---
Not at all, but many aspects of that episode in particular draw inspiration from the game.
---
Didn't Jormag absorb Mordremoth's powers?
---
...that's a gameplay perspective, the comment I was responding to was a lore perspective.
---
Amazing job, keep it up!
---
I think they did good job with LW3 after initial HoT  problems.
---
I feel like there are off the mark completely.
---
I appreciate the dark atmosphere and lores, but we're talking about the pact commander who slain one god and 3 dragons. 
---
They could potentially do better with some other themes.
---
I wish.
---
pack
---
&gt;I mean, I'm probably one of the harshest and most thorough critics of GW2 design out there
---
Hehe, such a funny guy.
---
Whats the context for his remarks?
---
Same could be said about dragons. They are related to reptiles, so cold-blooded as well. 
---
Why some Players try to apply rules from our world to different one.
---
Sup.
---
Your "matemathically" deduction can easily bypassed by anet if they wanted. They would just need to make the hero challenges of LS5 give more than 10 hero points or something completely different like having new specializations require less hero points. You have to think "out of the box" for these kind of things.
---
In any case i'm surprised that you took so much to realize that new specializations are not going to come on LS5. It's simply too much work, not only to design but also to balance. A new set of specializations is something really worth of being part of expansion release. Sure they could try to go little by little releasing an specialization for a class on each episode until all 9 got a new one, but that would be very unfair.
---
i know!! made my little sylvari heart so happy
---
Hey I was thinking, maybe it would be easier to play with the mastery if instead of just a buff we could get a visual of what essence we have charged. Thinj like Chieftan And Svanir floating badges in Forest of Niflhel, like the character would get a similar floaty badge for each essence that glows stronger the more we charge it, and maybe flashes when the skill is available to use. It's really distracting to keep looking at the buff bar trying to see what and how much of essence I have.
---
i'm pretty sure they did!
---
Is this the man who decided to kill Aurene, make articles about how character death is important, and then decided to revive her in the second scene of the last episode? What a joke...
---
There a no exclusive rewards from the strike missions if you mean that
---
He's not a dev tho, he's one of those freshmen hired by Anet into important positions becausr they can afford to pay them less.
---
Thanks for taking your time for replying. I think the ideal would be to find the middle ground. Just like the strike mission got harder, add that thought to open world as well. The objective would be to make those players you mention keep feeling the difficulty ramp up until it starts to reach the middle and hardcore players. One way to do that would be to add easy and hard content on the same map. Let some of these areas be a dangerous zone some players are scared to go while others will enjoy the challenge.
---
Yes, the lower skill players will complain, but it's good to teach those who are stubborn while teaching others that not everything in the game is made for them. There are all kinds of content, if you are not ready to learn, just play what you can.
---
I will give an example: I'm more of a middle ground player. Sometimes I reach specific stuff I'm bad at and that can frustrate me. Ultimately, as those things are there anyways, I either have to practice until I manage them or I have to ask for help and in the last case scenario, I let it be until I feel like tackling them again. Is it frustrating? Yes it can be. But many times it was also a great learning experience and helped me to improve as a player. If you worry too much about low lvl players all the time, not only will you lose the other parts of the community cause the content will keep disappointing but you will also have more and more difficulty to use ur creativity when developing stuff. We all know how too many limitations can hinder the potential of any creative mind.
---
Hope anything I said helps out. We players can whine a lot but we really love this game and want to see it shining.
---
Yea I can't quite figure out the incentives of going for gold vs silver.
---
Likely more resources for not much net increase in revenues compared to maintenance mode and gem store sales.
---
I don't have any control over the SoundCloud anymore, unfortunately, and only contributed one piece of music across the two releases. The rest of it would have to come from the studio. You can try tweeting at them, maybe.

If the night king can turn a Dragon why not the sons of svanir?
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Are you alright? Not sure makes you think that I waste my cooldowns but ok. Hope you feel better tomorrow.
---
why cant you make fun of gw2 without being"obsessed"
---
This is seemingly really buggy for me.  I really hate achievements like this where playing a low mobility class gets punished for no reason.
---
Okay! Thanks again!
---
The implementation of Guild Halls, a completely new concept of progression (HoT: mastery system), a new profession, the introduction of game changing, universal masteries like Gliding, Mounts.
---
The Living World could only build upon these systems because __expansions__ implemented them earlier. 
---
Season 1 or 2 didn't have a mastery system or a new profession, Season 4 could only add new mounts because the mount system was developed for PoF. 
---
Imagine what the Living World looked like without expansions.
---
Pre HoT Anet earned ~20bn won each quarter. After HoT it was 15bn won. You'd normally expect an expansion to increase earnings also on the long run. HoT didn't. Numbers dropped by 25%, that's a lot. LS managed to stabilize these numbers and prevented them from collapsing I'd say.
---
Pre PoF earnings have further degraded to ~14bn won each quarter. They are now (after also some bit of erosion) at ~15-16bn won. Pof has increased earnings also on the long run. (probably bc mountskins).
---
Google for "gw2 dx12"... Though I am not sure if it works for Mac as well
---
We now have lense to look at "old snapshot", so I presume we will have a ton of flashback in the next episodes, including who/how killed her (my bet is on someone significant for her succumbing to whispers, and then a quest to convince that character to join us for revenge).
---
I don't wanna be that guy but, stop hope, play the game as it is if you enjoy or stop play, you will be happier if you stop care about it because in the end, nothing will change, gw2 will only give you living world/saga, wvw almost 3 years for alliances inc ?, pvp super stale ..
---
I like most of the stuff but I think tempest should be pure heal. Earth line for protection on auras and water for better sustain
---
Also it would feel more natural. Now we have some flashy skills exploring mechanics that never existed in the world before, and probably will be never used outside of this map and it's expansion
---
what makes you think its the ram...
---
&gt;and there were some "leaks" around 2 months before that, most of which anet DMCAed from youtube.
---
Anet said in late 2015/early 2016 that they are working on a second expansion. Name and details were unknown, but we knew they are working on a new expansion. I can't give you a source of the annoucement, but as example in this ama summary on dulfy (march 2016) http://dulfy.net/2016/03/05/gw2-reddit-developer-ama-summary/ you'll find them speaking about "expansion pack" or "expansion 2".
---
buy a proper PC :)
---
TeaAndDevils does have a point. You could directly respond to the tweets and start a discussion that might improve the game. Yelling into an echo chamber has never solved anything.
---
This
---
Please don’t make it too hard though. In a few months time when the maps aren’t as populated, if you scale too hard then it’ll be tough to solo / small-group clear them.
---
If you want more of the same living story without the cool mount masteries and raids/fractals
---
Apparently the new helm is but idk for sure.
---
I have no clue what server you are on i was talking in general. 
---
Having Kazo of all guilds as an example  that would prove your point shows that you don't know much about what really went down and you seem to have only heard their side. 
---
There is a very valid reason to why Gandara would never follow Kazo. Not even if they took the moon down to us. 
---
I guess Kazo forgot to mentiion that part. 
---
Sometimes a story is not as simple as it may sound like when not checking both sides.
---
Anyway Etheri the rest of the post is just full of rude talk and you make it really hard wanting to respond to it because it feel like we would argue on a very low level. A few of your points are valid but they kind of drown in everything else.
---
I'd suggest using https://gw2crafts.net/ for crafting, it expects that you never get bonus exp but it automatically designs the cheapest path to 400/500 crafting level. For sure start DPS is open world and transition later to boons if you want though boon chrono is only a meta thing in raids where it is hybrid DPS + boons (quickness + alacrity). I have my (WIP) [raid guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Raid_Guide#Builds) set up with a list of all the raid builds and what category they fall into.
---
You are making the fundamental mistake that this was an either/or proposition. Competently managed businesses sustain their successful products while developing new ones.
---
You want to move your best people to developing new games? Fine. You need good, not great people to put out a quality expansion that delivers more of what you have already. The economics of it aren't terribly complicated, and given the standing of GW2 in the wake of the PoF release a 3rd expansion was a low risk, moderate reward project that should have been the obvious thing to do.
---
A.Net had at least three well staffed, forward looking projects in development when NCSoft pulled the plug. You absolutely do that, or at least two of them, alongside maintaining your cash cow. That way you have a long term pipeline to sustain your company as your existing games gracefully age out.
---
But for whatever reason A.Net likes to cut their existing products off hard, leaving tons of money on the table, to hard pivot to their next game. They did this with GW1 as well, and it's just so surprising they are unable to manage a portfolio of games at different stages of their lifetime in a basic manner.
---
Which MapViewer, please ?
---
Expansions are very expensive to develop. Depending on player numbers it might not be worth it anymore.
---
As example: if you develop a new expansion with 100 devs in 2 years: this could easily be 20 million $. How much does Anet earn per sold copy? 10$? So 2 million sold copies required. 
---
Or from another perspective: PoF earned in the three strong quarters 20, 35 and 24 bn won (total 79). Compared to ~14 each quarter before. Difference is then 37 bn won or ~31 million $. This includes the (very likely) much higher gemshop sales. Keep in mind that mountkins are VERY popular and VERY expensive. Garden plots, increased inventory was afaik also at that time. PoF was very likely earning Anet lots of money. But now? Playerbase has shrinked further. It might simply be to expensive to develop another expansion. If they do they are probably just having a small team for it (which does not necessarily need to result in low amounts of content. You can develop lots of content fast, if done efficiently).
---
You know it will, tho.
---
I'd say you can get roughly 1000 hours worth of good gameplay out of this game. 
---
If I had to choose again now, as a hardcore player, I'd pass on this game to be honest. It's very mismanaged by the developer and is going in a very casual direction content wise.
---
it is absolutely normal for a hardcore player to deal 5 - 10 times the amount of DPS than a normal casual player, it is not a surprise at all. also we could have possibly gone bellow 5 min. but I fucked up the CC on the 2nd break bar phase
---
Thanks for the info and the link! I'm way behind on content, but I've been enjoying PoF video tutorials. There are some awesome ones, and Ayin Maider is amazing.
---
So you basically say "I nothing, but the story" and *then* complain about "not enough content"? 
---
Sure, if you ignore 90% of the content for whatever reason, ofcourse it's "too short", but hey.
---
Seems like a bad decision from anet. Why do this slightly harder strike mission if there are literally no good drops from it (aside from the ingots, which are easily obtained from other sources)
---
this type of player is never going to get better at the game if you just baby them and allow them to succeed without learning the combat system.
---
Well, even if it sounds a bit harsh, most of the price of your machine went into the Apple logo rather than its hardware.
---
Go look up your system specs (-&gt; About my mac) and post them here, so we can better estimate if 20-30fps is realistic for you.
---
I had a key on my first map, then i went afk, dced, and when i logged in back, i got rerolled and lost the key, got trans instead :(
---
Condi Scourge, with its cleanses and Epidemic, makes the current strike duo bosses pretty much cake.
---
so?
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply! :D
---
I agree with you, there should be more areas of the ge where skill plays an important role. Currently in this episode the most challenging thing to do is the Ice try achievement which is just rng hide and seek
---
or actually good dps builds make them quite easy
---
Not unlimited, you can only buy 3 per day (totals to 30 map currency for 75 eternal ice shards).
---
Jackals aren't exactly common. They're fragments of torment demons bound into stone and sand by djinns. You can't just go to a ranch and order a dozen.
---
No, I don't need fanfare and lack of realism a every corner. I need a story to attempt to follow basic writing conventions like a three act structure, half decent dialogue, having actual characters, not being so predictable even the rocks in the room can guess what's going to happen next and actual escelating stakes that make sense and we can understand.
---
Guild wars 2 does none of these things and every time it attempts to do these things, it falls completely flat on its face. From both a realistic and a fantasy perspective. Its shit storytelling all around.
---
 Its not "different" storytelling. Its just shit storytelling.
---
What's shamefuly idiotic is comparing guild wars 2 to pearl harbor, dunkirk and saving private ryan. 
---
Try to get closer to the level of dora the fucking explorer first and then you can actually start aiming for dunkirk.
---
At least dora the explorer has actual stated and consistent stakes in the story.
---
It was cheap and poorly executed, my point was that anet tried to raise the stakes by killing a long term character because they can't figure out another way.
---
From 23 map comps, my guildie recieved 7 keys total. Just unlucky streak. Happens.
---
i am guessing they don't want people datamining the episode count of the Saga via the tome so they're not releasing it yet.
---
&gt; it's even confirmed it was Jormag, not the Spirits of the Wild, that told Asgeir Dragonrender to flee South, 
---
Didn't the norn flee south specifically because of the threat jormag presented?
---
I already said that Anet isn’t delivering Dunkirk by any means, but go off I guess.
---
Great, i'm not doing it ever again :)
---
Except for the one thing you chose to quote?
---
3 out of 9 here. Got the springer :&gt;
---
I completely agree with the spirit of this. I waited almost 18 years for a favorite TV show to get a decent remake based on the comics it was pulled from, so yeah, I'm totally willing to wait for quality content that tells a great story.
---
That being said, the comparison falls apart there, because imagine reading a science fantasy series of books that come out once every couple of years, then they change to magazines once every 4 months, then they change from science fantasy to doing horror stories.
---
I, the reader, am confused. And not sure if I want to keep buying these books/magazines/whatever they are now.
---
^(I just want my science fantasy books back like please don't make this whole saga horror themed I'm begging you Anet ugh...)
---
You also spouted bullshit like pretending the only reason I take issue with the story is because I want lack of realism and fanfare at every corner when gw2 story fails both from a fantasy and a realism perspective as a story for all the reasons already stated, lack of stakes, lack of arcs, lack of forshadowing, extremely predictable story, bad dialogue, no actual conflict, bland characters, ect ect.
---
I was gonna say "add a table of contents" but then I saw the button, pressed it, and I was impressed with the UI. Very cool.
---
Daybreak is making planetside 3...
---
Hey, that's completely fine. Don't succumb to feel like you're missing out just because you can't grind as much as others or anything.
---
Playing to have fun is the best possible way to go about it, especially in such a casual friendly game as GW2.
---
Enjoy your time!
---
Yeah and they said they are working on another EQ. They aren't abandoning their other titles though.
---
The problem isn't making something new. It's making something new at the cost of killing off the other title first.
---
Though to be fair, the points made by most can only come from ”true” fans but I’d rather call them dedicated. I mean someone who has only managed to gear and level one character won’t complain about the Build Template update. The complaints will be coming from people who has multiple builds and multiple characters, aka those who dedicate a good chunk of their time in the game. The radio silence from Arena net won’t really bother who’s currently trying to catch up on the content, but it will bother those who’s already done it and are having worries about the games well being. Sure, not every complaint is from a die-hard fan but logically the majority of them *has* to some extent be long-term players.
---
Looks like feathers
