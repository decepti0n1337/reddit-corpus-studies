I farm home instances every day and even though I'm only getting a bit at a time, it adds up and I have all those currencies. With how valuable home instances are I'm surprised more people to farm full ones daily. Particularly because it often gives you one of your dailies anyway and there are always people offering. It means a lot less farming when you need them.

GW2 was my first MMORPG and I accidentally bought PoF before even HoT so I was even more confused than missing just season 1
---
Pls do, I was bummed out when I saw on that dev stream how basically everything but flying was the same.   
---
Also I really hate his face, looks dumb af. I like the idea of him curling his neck and tail like a snake, but then you see that absolute unit stance with his legs. He is like a bulldog-snake with stolen animations.
---
I'm almost there, hopefully i can completed this in 2 more days.
---
I miss dungeons =\
---
after Tiiiiiiiime
---
Not so much after this episode tbf ü§î
---
Taimi was really helpful in ls3
---
Just farm Istan or Riba then, back in the day when Griffon was released Istan was still fully functional, a good group could hop maps and clear Palawadan up to 2-3 times per event and get Great Hall done in the downtime.
---

---
Its harder nowadays but I started with PoF release and it was really easy to make gold then, just dont waste your time doing whatever! Farm gold the fast way and not the slow one.
---
Servers only matter for WvWvW.
---
As long as both of you are on either NA servers or EU servers, you can play together.
---
But if you want to play WvWvW with your friend you both have to be on the same server.
---
Only if you want to play WvW together will you have to change servers. Everything else is on a mega server
---
It's Mermay in the art community, everyone's drawing mermaids. Nice Trahearne fanart though.
---
Yes. Playing HoT as a Sylvari is definitely worth it.
---
What‚Äôs to miss? They‚Äôre still there.
---
No, timegates after timegates just to learn i have to grind 250 map currencies in each map, holy shit i wanted to kill myself. congrats to anet for making me not touch these living story maps ever again
---
Same :( I wish they'd get an update
---
Like a hard mode, etc
---
Not working i have try ls4 ridings and other 0/5
---
It would be noobish.
---
I miss them being more active. My old dungeon group, myself included are more or less done with GW2. Still somewhat bitter they just left dungeons to rot
---
Anything to actually make people want to do them. I remember vanilla, is that what we call it now?, Gw2 and how easy it was to run everything outside of Arah. Now even COF is a pain to get groups for
---
Yep I'm posting here to find like minded players: Players who want a top meta build that dish out crazy dps or support and won't accept repeated mistakes from themselves or others. I'm definitely not here to give training boots for dungeons, but won't mind training the right person if they have potential :)
---
If time is money and you have neither, do you just turn into a black hole and accept the End?
---
I only got it 'fixed' once by killing everything in a LARGE sphere around the NPC. 
---
But looks like sometimes something spawns inside the walls that nobody can kill.
---
Same by me 
---
Why anet not fixing

Grind the meta events in auric basin, tangled depths and dragons stand. The exp will come quickly.

I saw that servers are linked. Does that mean if he plays on a server that‚Äôs linked with me we can play wvwvw together?

The only thing that worked for me to avoid cinematic disconnects was closing other applications in the backgorund like browsers, then playing with minimum settings.

As a Reaper, I welcome all non-summoned minions into My ranks as well. You don't even have to die to join My cause! Praise My benevolence. Joko was but an imposter and heretic to My cause. Join with Me, your Goddess of Death!

Hmmm that could work. Thanks for the idea
---
I didn't even know Guild Wars 2 existed back then. I don't know what this aggressive comment here is all about.
---
Been there, seen that. An unfortunate day for collecting indeed.
---
hoping for a primeval pack
---
Yes, but links get shuffled every 2 months, so you're not guaranteed to play with your linked buddies forever.
---
&gt; Mainly RP tbh.
---
I knew I forgot to add something! Well if you ever have a character you're going to RP that involves a dragon..I know that's what one of my friends is doing.
---
I was about to post the Video, but than i saw your post.
---
So if I play my level 80 charr, what would I do in a given day? If I want to start over and experience leveling from a different perspective, what class / race is really good right now?
---
Also Griffon: OHHH NOOOOO
---
The idea of spending months of development time for content that would only be in front of players for two weeks then gone forever was never great, it was always a huge waste.
---
Ya get rid of downstate and ensure that nobody ever wants to play anything but deadeye and burst mesmer that nuke people before they have the chance to react then vanish into stealth with no counter play.
---
Long time lurker here, I was wondering if it's still possible to get the Dragon Emblem Clothing Outfit from the Alienware Game Vault promotion. I just returned to the game and would hate to miss out on this outfit.
---
Griffon, especially when going across maps with ease, compared to the other mounts.
---
Yeah just remove like 2 of the ‚Äúi‚Äùs in time.
---
Cinematic wise 8 is better but nobody really gives two shits about ff8. Its ff7 that was revolutionary being having 3d models albeit poor blocky ones but it was a more easily enjoyable game to get into and play than 8. I mean seriously you using your fucking magic to gain stats which makes using magic a hindrance.
---
Does it continue if you hang on a wall again, or does that also reset it like landing does?
---
"Time gating"? How about repeating a couple dozen map collections 3 times over, maxing out literally every LWS4 map resource, completing a couple dozen different jumping puzzles, visiting 28 zones to close rifts, etc.... I think the "time" being eaten is supposed to be personal time.
---
It's probably not a cooldown and more a problem with the specific instances. I waited over 2,5 hours in one instance and switched between that and another one. In both of them, lots of people where waiting there and nothing happened. I eventually killed it on another instance.
---
If you want to use the free treat you can get, probably save it for this one or do it early.
---
Griffon: Your wannabe spyro ain't impressing me :P
---
As it stands in game guard does not tank.
---
It can heal, power dps or condi dps but not tank anywhere near as effectively as mesmer or now scourge (due to the former simply avoiding most damage and the later having so much barrier to prevent it)
---
Don't be a drama king.
---
Also, I clearly said why are they JUST remaking FF7, not "why FF7?"
---
Gaw, tired of this stuff.
---
Since you unlock abilities and traits piece by piece you'll generally have a good idea of what each class' kit is capable of. You'll also unlock more areas and way points to get to places more conveniently when you need to in the future.  
---
A lot of people boost to 80,look at a guide or raid build and try it out with abysmal results and then write the class off. Leveling naturally will give you a better idea of how a class plays instead of the instant gratification
---
Unfortunately Skyscale's height limit is set to your original launch point (i.e. last place you were in a "land" state), so you hit the height limit stupid fast via Oakheart or Thermal Tube.
---
Griffon controls like a hot knife through butter, skyscale controls like a butter knife through a rock covered in molasses.
---
I only know Rox and Braham. never played the rest.
---
Path of exile did just announce a new league that looks great. I also burned out from this collection and decided to take a couple of months break to play some PoE once the league drops. It's either gonna reinvigorate my passion for GW2 or have me drop it completely, honestly at this point I'm fine with either.
---
I had no idea the commander left the Pact, I just thought he was in a meeting so he was not able to join the fleet that attacked the HoT maps.
---
I didn't realize the GS auto was bad, cause I definitely do a good bit of it,will try the combo and avoid auto attacking, thanks for the tips!!!!
---
I have a friend who completely disagrees on the point of being less clunky.
---
For them, Skyscale is the one less clunky. 
---
* When you first get Griffon, you can't hold S to land. 
---
* You're constantly drifting
---
* Drifting at high speeds was a thing that just didn't click with them
---
* They *haaate* the griffon expert/master courses.
---
* Skyscale movement is steady while hovering. It doesn't move unless you want it to move.
---
* You can use the Mount Ability 2 key to land, this is available by default.
---
* The only clunkiness with Skyscale is how easily it sticks to nearby walls but you gradually learn to just avoid walls to work around this, just like how you eventually learn how to hit walls (most of the time) with Griffon and Roller Beetle to avoid losing speed.
---
i understand what youre saying, i did farm my fair share of gold, but my playtime is limited now and i dont wanna spend all of it on gold farm, thats no fun to me :/
---
this game truly is amazing for filthy casuals and i love it!
---
And that's not how it is nowadays anyways? Pew pew zero ranger *leaps away over 5000 clicks with 3 skills then mount dodge dodge dodge another 2500*
---
Think he meant that the main story of core game is not on par with other games. And i can\`t say i\`m not agreeing with him. However I don\`t feel like it\`s fair to look only at the story mode to declare a game to be unfit for new players. The game\`s aestetics, the gameplay, the extremely large explorable world all account in my book to say that GW2 is an amazing game regardless of its earlier (and some current) flaws. Also as far as story goes, it only gets better imo. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cheers!
---
Literally *the entire fucking point* of my comment is that you shouldn't have to choose one. Whether a goal is long term or can be done quickly should depend on how much effort and time one person can put into it, that's why time gates are shit.
---
Using a VPN solved the issue permanently for me. This may ir may not work in your case, but it's worth a try, I'd say.
---
That specific promotion ended May 3rd. You can the other ways it's been given out [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Emblem_Clothing_Outfit) vut you'll need to wait till the next time they give it out (or get a code from someone).
---
I would have constant issues with this with both my desktop and a laptop on my home network, but never with my laptop at hotels or friends' houses. It turned out to be related to my router/modem combo. Almost anything with a cutscene or even long scripted dialog would cause DCs. I ended up switching out the router/modem my ISP rented me for a new good modem and new decent router and haven't had issues.
---
Saving Skyscales - Blood and Life are Skyscale egg collections! First go to Sunpear's Refuge, talk to Gorrik you can find him by the small diamond icon on the map. Take the egg. In either order: go to Command Waypoint at Dragonfall and talk to General Almorra to unlock the Skyscale Blood collection. Go to Dwayna waypoint in Divinity's Reach and talk to speedboosting Priestess of Dwayna to unlock the Skyscale of Life collection. Then just do the first step in the sub-collections going to the waypoints in the guide and talking to the npc‚Äôs to unlock the collections before completing them. This is so that you can complete these collections while doing the others. Leave The Grove omphalos chamber instance so you can see the waypoints.
---
Thanks for the compliment. :3
---
AANNNDDDD.... TIIIIIIMMMMMEEEEE AGAAAAIIINNN
---
ugh not worth my time sadly (thanks god i stopped doing it)  , wondering what will hapen in 3-4 months (or 1 year+ ) , when new players arrive to this point....by that time items will be cheaper tho ...but still huge grind
---
Here's my issue with the skyscale collection but more specifically the map currency farming as it is now:
---
\-250 per map is just completely insane considering how little you get doing the event/my own appraisal of the new mount. GW2 is supposed to be my little escape from the stress of day to day but this whole skyscale collection has left me feeling more upset that I'm not using my time as efficiently as possible than anything else I have going on in my life right now.
---
\-Most people are suggesting using alt chars to speed up the currency farm and while I do have 6 chars only one of them has access to all the ls maps. She is my first character and I am intentionally taking my time. The way I like to play the game is to run through large chunks of a characters story so that it feels more like I am actually building their character. This collection wholly discourages that. At that rate of play I won't be done for weeks, long after everyone has already gotten their scales or given up on their collections entirely.
---
\-I'm already exhausted by the grind. Aside from the skyscale collection I've been running the Thunderhead Peak meta so that I can build my first Dragonsblood weapon but taking a break from one grind for another is just too much and they even share some of the same resources.
---
\-I'm just tired of it. Every day it feels like there's another 3+ hour grind added to the list of work needed to be done and while I've seen a lot of people already have the mount and there is in fact an end, I am still days of active work behind and totally burnt out.
---
I think I'm gonna step away from GW for a while as much as it pains me to even say that. I guess I'll just wait until Anet inevitably releases a Crystal Desert Currency Exchange voucher so that I don't have to deal with hours of headache. Makes me a little bitter even thinking this was their intention all along. Frustrate us with hours of work only to allow us to pay our way past the grind.  Sad how they are choosing to revitalize these maps for what will probably only be a month before everyone has gotten what they needed and the resentment for the grind keeps people away. Sorry to add to the already massive list of complaints surrounding this mount but I am just so frustrated I needed to vent.
---
Wish more people thought this way. She's part of the shit writing for so many seasons.  Anet is getting away with it due to the skilled voice actress it seems. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Just a quick add to this, if you try to gather "one flax" and gather the, lets say: 6 of them together, with the Karma tools it will consume 6 at once.
---
To be clear, harvesting one node doesn't mean tha will consume only one use from the gathering tool.
---
The problem with this, IMO, isn't so much that asura are smart - the problem is the writers only seem willing - or perhaps are only capable - of delivering main storyline exposition in the most ham-fisted, narrator-esque way possible.
---
IMO, relying solely on an 'expert in the subject' NPC delivering a line of pure exposition is lazy - whether it's a charr legionnaire or an asura scientist. Asura get this treatment most obviously, partly because the 'fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants' worldbuilding of ANet's writers has recklessly pushed asura technology so far ahead of every other race combined it's genuinely absurd. As a result, asura characters with any story relevance are often reduced entirely to motiveless exposition machines.
---
I want actual asura characters - not pseudo-narrators for the writers to be lazy with. Taimi has been moving in a good direction on that front, but in LS3 and a lot of PoF's story she was definitely still being written like an excuse to put a third-person-omniscient narrator in a first person story.
---
It's an ok set, but i've got a few gripes with some of the design choices - like the fact that YET AGAIN all 3 weights of the non-female versions have the sex appeal of a nun habit while their counterparts include thigh slits and crop tops - but it's a nice aesthetic over all and a really cheap set of exotic diviner gear, and much more attainable than requiem was
---
The charr voices used to be really cool, now they're just bland and the new female charr voice just sounds like a black woman, cause its voiced by a black woman.. It's so jarring and bland, incredibly bland.. Depressingly bland...
---
Dank
---
I really wish they'd release a mid-version of it with the fancy new parts added without the crystals.
---
It's not worth it, the Griffin is still the best / most fun and the most pleasant controls. The skyscale wall sticky gets annoying fast.
---
&gt; Is there anything that tells us where the skyscales all go
---
Nope. They vanish and it is left unexplained. I was expecting them to be around the nest area as well but nothing.
---
I'd give you gold if I wasn't in the minus right now.
---

---
Don't forget to use dashes. Up to 4, with vigor. 
---
With them, it has short burst speed similar to raptor's, but IN SPAAACE. At least in air.  Because of that, it actually outperforms griffon on short distances, even if it is a cliff to gain speed. Tbh if there are no cliffs (or clear way to your target! Don't blame the catbird for you hitting branches and losing all momentum), griffon is pretty worthless. 
---
Skyscale has some clunky moments (inability to fly down, climbing that cannot be rebound to something else than forward movement), but it completely takes over rough terrain mobility role.
---
Anyway, people obviously need time to actually learn how to use skyscale, get it's second mastery (yeah, I'd like to see someone judging griffon for it's masterless versions) and get over timegate butthurt/meme.
---
just posted a pic myself im there!
---
Everyone is here \\o/
---
Not played GW2 properly for years now, but season 1 was so fun. Always something new.
---
It's been 20 years. Over the years, I've noticed more nostalgia and praise, and less stress put on the junction system and art design. The various sales charts (at certain points in history; not overall), crit ratings, fan polls and such put the game as a serious contender to FF7. 
---
Story-wise, and this is impossible to qualify, I believe the games to be equal. 
---
Gameplay-wise -- the most important thing -- I never had a problem with the junctions, and played in such a way as to not rely on GFs around late disc 1.
---
We're in the middle of 2019. I'm 32. This isn't 1999, or 2005, or 2010. I really don't think I need to keep playing skeptic to people's cynicism or dissidence or even their own skepticism. I like them all equally, with partiality to XII, but TBH many of them are literally incomparable. That should be the rule of day.
---
Why is this even being discussed at length? Rhetorical question.
---
Good day to you.
---
On my guard i run Harriers for healing/support. But honestly, doing celestial is just as good now that it adds boon duration not meta but gives you well rounded enough especially if you do torch off hand.
---
This Guild Halls is perfect for the roleplayers. It's the only with real house and rooms if is full. My guild have a tiny community of roleplayers inside and pur guild halls it's like a real town, and I love this.
---
The other two are good, but not enough for build a real city.
---
Which one is the best then?
---
I don't know if you are being a troll or just plain blind... but that's an screenshot...
---
If you're saying this because i didn't hid the hud, the Tags vanish if i hid the hud...
---
Sounds like an interesting journey to me. I was going to be playing the game anyway, so why not play these parts? I like having a big goal other than "idk, more gold?" to work toward.
---
I know you cant hide hud but its so small it looks like phone pic. Lol
---
thanks very helpful! ill look into that.
---
Useful info, thanks i agree after trying dps out earlier.
---
Totally agree i'm running condi/dps now, its working well!
---
FYI: Griffon can skip most of the Buried Archives JP, the wiki even has a picture of flight path on the page. You will end up hitting a no-mount zone when you are almost there, but you can use Bond of Faith to cover rest of the distance.
---
[here is the paper i did before the release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AwutpQwKTyprFj9BBciBGQ9ZnJzE9hDHL3Yv7TSaMg0/edit?usp=sharing). that will mostly be the same except i'll record better footage of the skyscale myself instead of using trailer footage, and in addition i will write a second part which dives into why (in my opinion) it's a mechanical failure
---
I was arou d for season 1, but when I got to season 2 I had no idea who the npcs were. I mean I remembered meeting them, but didnt care I guess. 
---
It wasnt until Taimi almost gets murdered that I started paying attention.
---
ty OP.
---
Got my Skyscale.
---
Other than the mandatory saddle parts, I've spent 0g.
---
Dracarys!! :)
---
Cue in "Thriller" by Michael Jackson
---
I'll be happier if I could do the world boss and jps simultaneously while doing the feeding phase. These days, I just log off after feeding the Skyscale and play another game. 
---
No matter how much I love the lore, I like efficiency more.
---
I only play solo in this game outside of open world meta events/world bosses (inherently group content). I've rarely done fractals or raids, or wvw or pvp, so I can only comment on those with what little I know. I've been doing this for years now, and I always come back.
---
The game is VERY solo friendly and you can do everything yourself -- all crafting, leveling, etc, and even some of the guild stuff. If you get good enough you can even solo dungeons (and even fractals), and there are plenty of videos of people doing that. Your gear and levels will pretty much never be obsolete -- neither will your class/specialization. That being said, this game is meant to be played at the max level. You'll have to hit 80, and then you'll have quite a bit of content to do after that. It may be a bit overwhelming for you as a solo player if you go for both expacs at once (and you really should do them, especially if this last living world episode is indicative of the future -- it combined a lot of elements from both expansions into one map, and before they were not doing that). 
---
I dabbled in ESO not too long ago and found that it was far too grindy and not much was explained, and that there was simply too much stuff to do with little direction. That game was also really trying to get you to subscribe, while this game is buy to play. All the cash shop items can be bought with gold via gold to gems (cash shop currency) so your hard work pays off. The tutorials could use some work in this game, but you can literally /wiki anything and you will find almost all the relevant information for it. There are also a lot of clear cut goals, and the quest hearts (replacements for quests like in WoW/ESO) are easy to follow. The community is also VERY very helpful, especially in major cities. 
---
Honestly, 9.5/10 game.
---
Majestic asf
---
is it a good idea? yes, creating content for more dedicated players while putting in minimal extra effort? what could go wrong? i tell you what. ppl struggle with even the normal mode of the ex pac fights, they do, to this day you can find ppl on lfg asking for help. people would whine and complain ‚Äúwhy does my precious open world have require me to have a brain‚Äù. if it was me who decided i tell fuck off and do the stroy CM but its not me, and its not you, 95% if not more are complete casuals that click their skills...
---
I do p2 pretty often and I haven't had belka bug in a loooong time. They changed some of her behavior to make it bug less
---
I took advantage of my dragon, now what kind of shots can you take?
---
As opposed to... time spent standing around bullshitting in LA?
---
I am not sure if anyone else is having this issue but I just did the heart at Champion's Dawn, and did not get the kralkatite ore. may be you cannot get it any more as repeat attempts?
---
Like I said, a little bit of rework so players won't feel its necessary to use this method.  I'm not saying to give it a dramatic improvement, but if the mount reached that high to begin with I doubt anyone would be complaining about how they keep getting stuck on walls since they could easily just land on top of them 5 times out of 10.
---
Old reddit post that shows the shortcut https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8od5bi/goemms_lab_shortcut/  it's super handy :D
---
Are there achievements for the armour set?  I only have the pieces from story and map unlocks, but didn't see any unlocks for an armour collection ding.
---
What happens on the 28th? I guess I'm out of the loop.
---
"What? Taimi? It eats Taimi?"
---
Agree, they could update the old textures to match the quality standart that we have now...something like a overhaul patch for the core game, which could upgrade armor and weapon sets textures, dungeons update, story mode reworked(give Zhaitan a fight worth of a Elder Dragon) etc...i would be willing to pay for something like that.
---
I do daily sandswept node farm, and I usually net 40+ just from the nodes each day. Tekkit has a great route for tacO. You can farm extra Istan currency for volatile magic. You get 75 per character from the hearts and consuming them gives 3-5 volatile magic, so on average you can get 300 volatile per character per day.
---
Probably out doing normal skyscale stuff and breeding. Gorrik kept them to save them, not kept them for pets. And besides, did you not see all the dirty looks the griffons were giving them? It's their house. :P
---
https://imgur.com/a/zlv4yo3
---
It's rough, remember you can use the treats to bypass that unlock.
---
Yep. I have 8 characters but indeed the point is that it's just not fun.
---
I hope they don't fix this üòÅ
---
Much more than griffon if you account for the gold value of the map currencies
---
Also with Mordremoth in the 2nd raid wing which takes place after HoT there are huge vines all over the place and if you interact with some of them it tells you that they are lifeless and devoid of magic.
---
Thanks a bunch!!!
---
Also if anyone is interested in doing some scrims pm me in game: TheSun.4321
---
We would really appreciate the practice
---
This mount is more like a rock climber.
---
Percentile and percent are different. Being part of the 99th percentile is not the same as being par of the 99 percent. The first makes you part of the 1% while the other makes you part of the 99%.
---
If that's what you mean.
---
The temple teleports in Siren's Landing required you to buy access for 10 pearls each. The mastery had nothing to do with it.
---
And also [Arkk](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arkk)
---
It also uses griffon animations
---
&gt; The vast majority of your healing is in a legend you're only spending half your time in (and that comes down to using Natural Harmony), the orbs heal very little, you have no regen which is extremely essential for mitigating the 'chip' damage people will inevitably take, and because of legend-swapping and energy you cannot always react well to what is happening. 
---
You're playing it wrong. Most of your healing is in Kalla. If you're getting more healing out of Ventari, then you're either underestimating what you get in Kalla (which it sounds like you are), positioning your spirits wrong, or your group is simply horrible at avoiding damage forcing you to heal more in Ventari than anyone should have to. (ventari spam is what takes Ren heal from a 10-12k HPS ceiling to its 16-17k max)
---
&gt; Soulcleave also heals people for much less than people want to give it credit for if your DPS isn't literally 99% percentile 
---
It's based on hit rate, not damage, and it is responsible for 2k-6k HPS *by itself*, depending on that hit rate. That's one of the highest healing single skills in the game.
---
&gt; it will not save them if they are taking damage
---
Actually, Kalla Elite plus Kalla Heal is enough to *solo* remove the damage from a green circle explosion on VG, including aura and tank autos, with no one dropping.
---
&gt; It being so limited to a single, small space absolutely kills it because the actual healing value of the tablet is actually absolute garbage - seriously, you should look at it
---
This is why most of your healing is... in Kalla. Ventari is great, but it's overkill in most cases, and the limitations are annoying.
---
&gt; It's less than regen on most healing builds
---
What... is your fixation with regen? Yes, Ren is the only major healer without it. It's also the only healer that really doesn't need it. Staff orbs function very similarly with better control, and the general healing output is just so high that it doesn't matter unless people are spread entirely to the four winds.
---
&gt; The staff changes are nice, but they only provide orbs, which heal for such a small amount they're not worth it. Your only heal skills worth using are the 4 and 2, and you're already so constrained on energy that you want to minimise your use of weapon skills, especially if you are also providing might. I have also never seen these orbs save people from death. 
---
I've never seen regen save people from death. The orbs are functionally the same.
---
Don't press anything in staff other than 4 and 5. 4 for an emergency cleanse, 5 for the CC. 3 is a decent enough block if you need it. Don't need it.
---
&gt; Additionally, you really want to hit 100% boon duration on support Ren builds. 78%-80% is theoretically enough but not does not take into account phases or human delay. 
---
It's not going to hurt you either way. More boon duration certainly helps, especially when providing might.
---
&gt; Heal ren sucks as your main primary healer if your groups are not fast, or they take tons of damage. That is the truth.
---
It's not. It's what you've experienced, but it's not what others who play the class more effectively have experienced.
---
&gt; There is a reason lower KP pugs look for a heal firebrand instead of a heal ren in fractals. Because a heal FB does have higher, more consistent heals than Druid, better defensive boon application, allows the Ren to provide stability and boonrip with their second legend choices if so desired, and overall often leads to a smoother than if the Renegade heals, as it is also better at pressing the "oh shit i need to save everyone" button. 
---
The reason is because heal firebrand is *easier* and you're more likely to find a passable one. Heal ren's skill floor is a lot higher, and you're much more likely to find a terrible one.
---
&gt; It absolutely sucks in pug runs, and is absolutely murdered by high movement fights or fights with lots of incoming damage
---
It's actually very good at both of those scenarios (particularly the latter, though also the former). You're simply... not playing it correctly.
---
I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you, but you're wrong. Your experiences with the class are based on using it sub-optimally. You're certainly welcome to your opinions, but they are not shared by those who play the class correctly, or by their groups.
---
you don't just "lose" assets.
---
They lost the assets for the HoT Mistward weapons and yet they came back at one point. In software development, you are working with a versioning software that saves your progress in a repository which you can always go back to. This is even more important when you work with multiple people on a project because it makes a lot of things easier like merging things and finding conflicts.
---
Just by that, it would be impossible to lose those things unless they don't add those assets to the versioning as well which would be pretty stupid if you wouldn't.
---
Too bad sometimes mounting up in mid air gives you red bar and you just fall instead of hover
---
I hate Trahearne but love Taimi :( I just found Trahearne so incredibly boring and impossible to feel any kind of emotions towards, he was incredibly bland, one dimensional and just boring all around. Taimi at least has a wide range of emotions, interesting dialogue and she's your companion rather than someone who just pops out of nowhere and takes the spotlight in the original story.

You actually didn't miss too much with Rytlock's appearance in HoT. Short version is he went missing in S2 and then he just pops up as a Rev in HoT and no one knows how or why and he is tightlipped about it. So knowing how he went missing shouldn't change the reaction too much.

I pretty much downvote any thread that says Anet pls. If you have a suggestion why not indicate what it's about in the title of the thread so the rest of us can judge whether or not the thread is relevant to us.

In this case, the thread is relevant in that I think it's a bad idea.  I just don't get why people have trouble putting their topic of discussion as the topic of discussion.
---
It's literally just a case of running around in a circle, doing the hearts, every single day (and if you have alts, on each alt too). There's nothing fun in that, just busy work. I'm only around 80-100ish on them and it's already mind-numbingly painful.

Makes sense though, I'm glad that particular meal of hers ended up being relevant.

That is great.

It's not too long, you can have ridiculously long titles on reddit posts. This isn't the official forums. But you know, it MIGHT have been a decent idea.  There was that chance.
---
They worked on other projects *like every other studio in existence that lasts longer than 10 years*. Blizzard works on many projects, it doesn't mean that WoW isn't important or that WoW suffers because OW is in development.
---
To what extent (if any) the other projects impacted on GW2's development is a complete mystery to the community. Josh Foreman said GW2 might benefit from a renewed focus on GW2, but he didn't say GW2 suffered because they were working on something else, the idea that a studio would work on something else is normal and health both for the studio and GW2. ArenaNet was hiring a lot of people too. It's not like HoT was built by 300 people, then they moved 100 off onto other projects and GW2 was being maintained by 200 people.
---
The conclusion that GW2's development was noticably worse because of other irons in the fire is not supported by any evidence - the existence of other projects or a movement of staff between projects doesn't indicate this either. If you look at season 4, it contains two mounts, two full armor sets, one partial armor set, two weapon sets and six maps. Many people claim the story was better than in the past (I personally disagree) and many of the maps are played more than in the past.
---
Guild Wars 2's development was just fine during Season 4. People love ripping on the game or running with damaging narratives started by a manipulative ex-employee because it supports their personal complaints about the game, but its absurd to treat JP as anything close to a reliable source, nor does any known facts strictly support her assertions (while several conflict with them).
---
Only if we get to mount it in combat so we can get a moa on a moa
---
Huh, my Skyscale must be a different one then because i sure do find plenty of use cases where it is the more efficient / more convenient pick than Springer, Griffon or a combination of the two. Plus, it acts as a better primer for the Griffon than the Springer and allows it to be used in much flatter terrain with full dive boost - if ypu use your Skyscale to full potential. It enables so many new options of travel.
---
Did you know you ascend quite fast if you actually aim the camera (as in right click aimed or action cam mode) where you want to go, so, up, instead of just pressing and holding spacebar? Its not Springer fast, that is unless you also use the endurance fed dash ability for ascension. You can use that angular.
---
And did you know you can use the dash to exceed the maximum height quite a bit by timing it near the depletion of your fuel gauge from ascension to make jumps to even higher ledges possible without sticking to a wall first?
---
I'd be much more okay with them if you could actually get them at decent pace from the events of the area. But the most efficient way is the hearts and they're just completely and utterly boring with zero challenge or variation. As you said, it's basically just running around in circles for certain time.
---
Enjoy it. Being under level 80 for the first time is a once-in-a-life-time experience.
---
BLSK has higher chance at dropping insignias/inscriptions so those salvages are worth it on the weapons/armor relevant for those.
---
I did not see a difference while using this, I think I stay with d912pxy, there is no big difference either but at least is makes the camera movement smooth and you can use it with the mound radial.

Anet has a very hard time doing things half way.  
---
Who ever made both these sets (pretty sure the same person based on design elements) did a great job with the base but then anet comes in and dials "muh shiny glowey asymmetry" to 11 rather than just letting us have a version with a bit more detail.
---
Apart from the bridge requirement, which can be a bit *too* tedious...

There is a huge difference between being asked to go back to maps for a one-time task (that is basically just gather runs and alt camping) that only bring temporary activity to the map and making the maps worthwhile overall.

dungeons start at level 30, where they're 5 man instances. 
---
We play this game because it doesn't feel like a lot of other MMOs. It's largely because this game values a lot of personal exploration and freedom of choice. You never feel like you're obligated to do one thing or the other, and you never really feel like you're just on a track going from quest to quest to quest.
---
Also, you never really feel like you're forced to play all the time to keep yourself competitive, which is a big plus for a lot of people who don't have the time to maintain that.
---
But I do understand, a lot of the game feels like a solo-player game with social elements. That feeling does get alleviated more as you start doing the large scale meta events and end game content, but I can see why it feels weird at the start
---
The crystals have VERY jarring asymmetry to them in a way that most people aren't going to like.  
---
I'm not sure what Anet thought they were doing tbh because it's been abundantly clear from past outfit releases that people don't go for the whole "random shit sticking out everywhere look"  
---
The ~~monster~~ bounty hunter armor from PoF is a perfect example of this.
---
Hearts are kinda a mixed bag, and a lot of people hate them for the reasons you stated and others. They're mostly there to fill up the world in lieu of traditional fetch quests or bear-ass collection, but they aren't actually very important. The best way to level is to ignore them and focus on events  where everyone helps work together a bit more (as a bonus, most events will count towards heart progress for the area too).
---
That said, as you progress, the game gets more dynamic (events more frequent and hearts more interesting ‚Äì many early hearts were dumbed down to make things easier to learn), and in addition you'll unlock story chapters you can play together for progression (within limits, the exact details of playing the earlier story together merit another post entirely) as well as dungeons and other group content.
---
Quit your current story by starting another story chapter, the go back to Victory or Death.
---
Since I finished my Skyscale today I figured I might as well comment again on the whole collection.
---
Worst offender personally was still the first three collections.  Too similar and being stuck in the same map is pretty draining.  I understand wanting to show a sense of steps taken to save the Skyscales but I just wonder if their could of been a more fluid and natural way of doing this.
---
The feeding step, while annoying initially, I kind of welcomed the days where I didn't have to do anything but feed it.  
---
The Charged Quartz has always been a issue for some players every time it comes up in game since not long after Dry Top existed.  Personally had no huge qualms with it, since you get it passively in a couple ways (home node, wintersday gifts).
---
Currency farming was a pain, but doable.  And was kind of glad to go back to old maps for a bit.  Though I still hate the whole sometimes I get not even a single currency material from a mining node.  
---
All the exploration steps were fine to me personally.  More in line with all the other collections to get you out and doing random stuff.  Flying training collection was pretty straightforward and simple.
---
Also, I appreciate the icons showing up on the map now to help show steps.  Though the one in Divinities Reach being misplaced confused me for a bit.  :P
---
Another random soul just glad that nothing terrible happened to her.
---
Thank you! I can't believe I missed that they added this set...
---
You can swap between individual nodes just fine, even hit up a different node time while the pretty lengthy extra strike buff lasts and get *additional* extra strikes using a gathering tool which doesn't have the glyph slotted.
---
The "lost strikes" bug is specific to "node farms", in that if you hit the maximum number of **different node entities** the entire farm will despawn until reset. As long as you just avoid touching any one flax node you can zigzag around Kodama's crop circle and get all the bonus strikes, but if you go in a circle hitting every node once all extra strikes will vanish the instant you hit the final plant.
---
I believe none of the wood farms actually use "node farm" logic, but the paired winterberry bushes do for example.
---
&gt;makes me wonder if ArenaNet tries to convince me to buy skyscale skins ASAP
---
  
---
lol bro, it's a guaranteed that Anet has a skin pack on deck for the skyscale  
---
The only reason they didn't release it on day one is because they know it's going to take most players weeks to complete the thing, if they even do.
---
I wonder if maybe it could be changed for future releases that you get the mount earlier, then instead of levelling it's mastery with XP, do so with collections/achievements.
---
+1 for a key mule
---
It is funny that after completing another Gatescale collection two days ago I was like "I have nothing to do in GW2, lets check PoE)". Just to log in 40 min before expansion announcement witch drops in a week.

I am like "man this game at least evolve". Was cleaning my standard storage yesterday.
---
Yea explains the lack of boobage.

With how quickly enemies in dungeons die, it's THEM who need tank stats!

Lots of things bothered me in this release- Kralkatorrik is no longer a huge metaphysical brandstorm, 2 hes much much smaller all of a sudden. and 3 now aurene is fucking op despite being 1/100th of his size and fires rocket league balls at him to take his wing off? 
---
And then somehow after eating domains of melandru, fissure of woe, underworld he gets stuck under them? It's ridiculous really. Might as well have a foreword by ANET- elder dragons are bad villains and we really wanna rush to kill them off in the worst way possible(we did this with joko too!) - ok thank you.
---
Thanks.
---
Grinding a new map that also has a very rewarding meta &gt;&gt;&gt; grinding a map I already ground the living fuck out of to get another, previous armor set that I don't even use anymore.
---
It's okay. I used the preview when by the cultural armor vendor. It seems okay. Didn't see any clipping with the normal body size. Thanks anyway   =)
---
I'm the same. Tried to grind some of the mats in Sandswept/Kourna/Jahai today and realised I really would rather be doing anything else than the same hearts over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I really really want to enjoy this, and I really want to just suck it up and do it, but I just can't trick myself into having any fun with this whatsoever.
---
For me it's not even about the time. I'd just like to do something that isn't completely braindead (going around the same map three times to press F on objects, going around other maps to press F to complete hearts).
---
or they could even reuse raid instances for solo content, for example.
---
I am not impressed at all. Took me 2 days to get it. Most of the achievements are easy and fun... some are incredibly dumb. I mean 25 bridge... what the hell Anet... stupiest boring tedious achievement ever. But my real disappointment was how the armor looks. Crystals sticking in the face of the commander? Crystals all over, huge ones. How anyone will fight with that. It breaks the fantasy setting for me. Base armor is very nice. Upgraded one sucks. So I am back to my Requiem armor. Now that is good looking, functional armor, not like this crystals sticking into butt crap...
---
So I guess "Thank you Anet for Requiem Armor".
---
&gt;this episode
---
I think you mean this mount. And specifically the mount, not even the mount unlock journey.  
---
Pretty much everything else was knocked out of the park. The Skyscale stands out because it's so incredibly mediocre compared to everything else. Actually, it's worse. It's simply not fun.
---
Ahh I love his work, really cool he played gw2
---
I agree, tbh. 10 or 15 of these events would have been enough.
---
Upgrade extractor doesn't drop those at all.
---
Zhed is major power, minor precision and minor ferocity. It is equivalent to the Berserker attribute type. Rune of the Eagle also increase ferocity and precision. Which means you are completely focusing on offensive and power stats so just with that you should do a lot of damage. However, depending on your weapons, you might focus on a different type of damage.
---
For example, since you are focusing on direct damage with your gear, you also should use direct damage weapons like the Staff or scepter/warhorn (tempest).
---
Your traits also need to support your gear because if you focus on increasing condition damage you will not be able to do as much damage as you could do.
---
Then there are other factors that can impact the difference between you and other players. They could have buffs like Might or fury and quickness on them which will increase their power, critical hit and attack speed.
---
In the end, there can be many things wrong just by your won playstyle with the profession that I can't say something about because we would have to see how you play to judge what mistakes you make.
---
You are also not a pixel mount for others to ride you for their amusement, now are you?
---
&gt; from the griffin animations
---
Why would they not copy those when the mounts share a skeleton?
---
Change to similar level zones of other races for additional experience, buy food and  sharpening stones or oils or crystals for additional experience, buy the cheap ones just for experience bonus.
---
Right, forgot about those.  Thanks.
---
To be honest, I'd rather that they just put this shine on older armors. It's an adequately metallic one, whereas previous attempts looked kind of plastic-y.
---
Did gorrik say that? Like are all those other hatchlings female?
---
If you can only play on a strict schedule, I could see the other bosses being worth skipping too.
---
But I think the same basic principles apply. Use food to skip things you can't do, not things you can't be arsed to do.
---
Let's not forget that a skyscale has much higher vertical reach than a springer, which allows it to scale cliffs otherwise impossible with just the springer. It's also a beast at collecting magic in Jahai Bluffs.
---
Dying happens.   On my mesmer there are some classes I never seem able to beat (Guardians and Engineers).   There are others I can easily take (Thieves and Necromancers).   If I can pick my fights I do.   If they pick me, I'll do my best and then res up when I fall.  WvW isn't balanced for 1v1 and shouldn't be.  It's a team mode regardless of the fact that many of us enjoy roaming.
---
The point remains though.  The mount isn't what is beating you.  Asking for nerfs to it isn't going to change the fact that the first player downed you.   Or that the second player would've turned the tide against you anyways. 
---
What will help though is learning to play better and accepting the fact that in WvW you will die.  Everybody does.   Even those hard asses making videos at levels most of us won't reach.
---
Generally to achieve some speed in combat, you need somewhat glassy builds, a build built for burst , and knowledge of enemy to avoid knockdowns and interrupts, and last a rotation that maintains damage.
---
The other option is to play in groups, many other builds enhance players nearby to speed combats, or protect other players to help combat.
---
The game is not centered on gear grind, so all players are fairly balanced, almost top level gear is fairly easy to get, and top level gear is only like 5% better, not a huge difference. Almost top level gear is character based, top gear is more grindy, but will always remain top gear and is account based. 
---
If you level slowly, you should get the gold for more character slots, I just wait for sales and buy gems. Pays for the game servers.
---
The actual picture...where did you get it?  Seems really dangerous for both kids
---
&gt;After finishing your Skyscale collection, you may think to yourself "I sure can't wait to use it in Dragonfall!"  
---
Literally targeting me, personally.
---
Neat post!   
---
What a way to get people to help out :DD
---
it does some damage, and projectile finisher, and used in the opener (after that for cc i would guess), discord them, too many questions, i would not answer without testing first.
---
PvP is broken depending on your point of view. There are 9 classes in the game with different build options but only like 5 distinct builds are played because they are superior in terms of everything. This makes it not fun for me because they're easy to play and repetitive.
---
No because like with most things regarding this mount, it's subpar to what we are used to. (I'm looking at you glitchy, griffon copy-paste anims)
---
He's harsh but right. Between myself playing Daredevil and seeing other people who play Daredevil well, I've seen respectable numbers on literally every boss except Largos twins (because no one plays anything other than mirage there lmao).
---
For quite a while now we've had very good balance for power builds and their viability across all of the encounters. Mirage makes condi balance questionable on some bosses but honestly the dps role overall has been in a fantastic spot in terms of variety for quite a while now.
---
bruh.. there's nothing small about that rez
---
Just because there is no feedback doesn't mean they "don't care". A lot of changes to profession actually happen because of PvP.
---
But what would you consider to be fixed? Why do you think it is broken?
---
&gt; Requiem is the shiny version of Elegy. Both are from Jahai Bluffs.
---
Elegy is behind a really nice collection, and Requiem is its continuation. I never made it past Elegy, but that was so good I nearly completed it just to see how it progressed.
---
Legit? I think this is blatant af the only difference is when it's flying/idling midair. Everything else is exactly like griffon

I didn't think the books were available in e book format..... If they are please point me to where I can grab copies for kindle. Been hoping for them to put them out in e book for years
---
imo i think we have enough mounts... the UI is bonkers as is and i fail to see a reason for a new one. we already have mastery tracks for each mount. ls5 could instead focus on upgrading the current mounts. Skimmer is obvious- make it so it can dive and swim underwater. Raptor could get a stronger engage or slight speed boost. Jackal gets a 4th dodge. springer can gets a skill that instead of jumping burrows underground unmounting you and giving a second or 2 invulv. griffon could get a stronger regular flap. idk about the other 3 since i havent really made it that far yet. i do achievments in order (almost at ls4)
---
The thing is though it's just a first release of the mount to the public. It'd be easy enough to tweak following all the feedback they've had since its release. A variable here, a coefficient there and the mount behaves differently. 
---
I remember they did a number of tweaks after PoF was released, making the skimmer faster on water, raptor not get hung on slight inclines so much etc. I'm sure they will Do something similar here. 
---
Personally I'd just be happy to have it and know that I can use it if I wanted to for those unique cases where it's the best option.
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah I meant that I wouldn't have minded if they made the cost of the armour require some sort of special drop. It seemed very easy and cheap this time around
---
Most ele builds revolve around fire/air/arcane plus the elite spec, so I guess you can work something out of the firs three.
---

I read similar explanations to this fairly often, but after reflecting again I noticed this is not that helpfull nor true at all. Nobody stops boosted charas from playing the base game + story and the defensive exotic gear may make the encounters a bit easier, but oftentimes it still requieres you to use the game mechanics to overcome the challange.
---
What you really miss on:
---
\- Not getting low level gear / drops (= hard to level up your craftings, if you only get high tier crafting drops)
---
\- Not ever beeing underleveled or undergeared in core maps (no gear threadmill, less inventory managmement, no need to level up before you can do next story mission, ect.)
---
\- Not having to unlock all the core skills &amp; abillities (=You can craft your own build right from the bat)
---
\- Having to run around without any mounts to speed things up (if you Boost to 80 and do the first PoF mission)
---
\- EXP for core Masteries (you get them after hitting lvl80, you need them to use mastery points for buffs like auto AoE loot and unlocking legendary crafting stuff, ect.)
---
\---------------------
---
My conclusion:
---
I'd suggest to:
---
\- Boost your character, but still play through the core story / game, if you don't care about crafting too much. (is needed for best tier EQ / a little bit of Gold farming and  [https://gw2crafts.net/](https://gw2crafts.net/)  will close the crafting gap fairly quickly)
---
\- don't boost your first character, if you like to explore crafting on your own and generally like the level up process and the pleasure of finding new nice looking gear for your new level, ect.
---
So you have 5 options to balance the party, you have tournaments to make it competitive, and after a while strategies become repetitive. What makes it easy to play? You getting used to better classes at best strategies - How to make it harder? Play different classes and try different strategies.
---
Mode variety sux, and that is on anet, everything else is on you. If you can not outplay an ez to win at build, there is a space to grow. Once you find there is no other way... and feel like there is no skill involved anymore, and other build i just better no matter what, it will become boring again. But hey how long are you going to play computer video games.
---
Arena-net cares, you can see. As you enter instance, the server is running ;) .
---
As a heads up, you don't need to do the race to get that PoI. There's a gate due west of the PoI that will unlock the PoI if you go rub your face against it.
---
I would love for you to show me specific clips of where you think the Skyscale shines. Where you have found it to be optimal and not just acceptable. I've read up on the threads doing unit speed calculations and tips/tricks for it, yet I still feel the way I do about it after a day of playing with it.
---
Every time I've used it in Melandru's section, I find myself wall latching to branches or just on the edge of a cliff. In the Underworld, full of small hills and tall cliffs, I find myself stressing the height gauge very quickly. In the Burning Forest I can get around much faster between the Thermal Tubes and Griffon up above or Jackal/Roller Beetle/Raptor down below and climb much more reliably with the Springer.
---
I've tried using it on the post-meta champ clean up, but it's just so much slower. I've tried using it for the meta, for lane defense, etc. The only time it actually felt alright was during lane escorts where the NPC mount speed is at about 80% of a player's.
---
It's not a *terrible* mount, but it does feel both clunky and inefficient as it is right now.
---
You took "UP THE TREE, QUICKLY" a little too far
---
I don't see the problem tbh. I love the way the skyscale looks.
---
It could just autoscale. If you're playing with five people in a party, the content should be more "challenging" than when you're playing alone in the first place.
---
I would love to give Gw2 a try again after all this time, the only issue I have is that I don't have any other character slot available.... Having bought the base game and the HoT expansion it kinda boggles my mind that I have to pay extra money for an extra character slot just to get back into the game. I feel like it is kinda silly and also will also prevent me from buying the next update if I actually enjoy and want to get back to it.
---
So my two options are either delete a lvl 80 character which I dont really want to or move to another game. Am I being irrational?
---
This is such bs answer. We're all going to die anyway so why bother with anything, right?
---
Skitt's Ships.
---
Name checks out
---
Go find it in Google Books store
---
&gt; You can Assimilate a culture into another without destroying or removing a culture and keeping it intact. Why is it so hard for you to understand that?
---
Why do you still insist on using the wrong word? It just doesn't mean what you claim it means. Integration is what you are apparently looking for. There is a reason why the Borg tried to assimilate. And the Federation tried to integrate.
---
&gt; The Asura would not be the only major race of judged by that criteria. Their technology is not enough to even come close to defeating the other races if power or technology were the deciding factor.
---
Yes, it would be. Easily actually. Golems are insanely powerful technology. Nothing the other races have comes close. Add the mobility the gate technology gives you. And you get magic as the only thing that might give others a chance. Except Asura have that as well. This becomes quite apparent in the GW2 books by the way. Although that is a different discussion. And wouldn't really be much fun in a game if they played it out reasonably.
---
&gt; I don't know what twisted moral mess you have going on in your head, but a lesser race across all forms of fiction, especially in GW2 just means they're less advanced in many different ways and not just technology or power.
---
Ok, let's have a look at your original comment. Your original claims.
---
"You can't tell me that looking at the Black Citadel / Rata Sum and then look at the Grawl, Ogre, Centaur, etc. You can't objectively tell me they're not inferior in every way. Their treatment is one thing, but the way the lesser races behave at times is such a primitive and barbaric way that we have no choice but to fight them."
---
You are by now so far removed from your original position, that indeed. You have reached a reasonable one.
---
THAT'S SO CUTE
---
I can already see Taimi writting a new thesis on Skyscales about that.
---
if they didn't care, they wouldn't be constantly fucking up PvE to try to fix PvP.
---
Is that your argument? Unexpected. 
---
What part of text are you even replying to?
---
Pls don't patch it or leave a backdoor.
---
Literally all the most efficient open world farms are Meta events.
---
Silverwastes, Istan, the new map, HoT Metas, and so on. And tehy are easy and never fail because players have done them over and over and over.
---
I don't get that feeling since that huge tail moves like it's made of silk and while landing there's 0 mass impact. Even the lightweight griffon has it, the skyscale literally just doesn't have that animation. 
---
I would completely forgive them for copy-pasting griffon if they atleast did it properly, he straight up has anims missing. Too little work has been put into this mount
---
No. I only wanted that dank 295 mastery number. The problem is that every map in existance except the newest one, Dragonfall, was not made with this mount in account. There is nothing I can't do and nowhere I can't go by simply using my gryphion/springer. Its too slow and the ascend energy bar runs out too fast. 3/10 imo regarding usefulness and overally quality of life.
---
Yeah well, she has proven to be manipulative and not exactly coherent with reality. If polite disagreement can be considered an attack, then I can also imagine she's been stewing in resentment since then.
---
 Lol, it took me 5mins to find that subtle skyscale joke...
---
I recall that it was always supposed to do that. But somewhere along the lines they gave up.
---
Not sure where though.
---
At this stage, I don't want to buy another slot. Maybe when it goes on sale.
---
Personally I run Berserker/Viper everything always, survivability comes with getting better playing the game being squishy and learning monster attack patterns, at most sacrifice damage using your utility skills in open world. Ele does a lot of damage so in a lot of circumstances you can just kill stuff before it kills you.
---
Weaver is one of the more complicated elementalist specializations, maybe try Tempest with Staff, even just sitting in Fire attunment auto attacking and using your F1, 2, 5 abilities on CD will pump out damage.
---
Try estimating by rewards, https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Special:RunQuery/Map_bonus_rewards_query&amp;Map_bonus_reward_query%5Bzone%5D=Fireheart%20Rise&amp;wpRunQuery=true for example if you just got 5 Thick Leather Section you are either at 3 or 5 k, remember what you got just before, you could pinpoint, im sure.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. I was considering making a post myself, actually. I finally updated the look of my Daredevil after many years of looking plain as all hell. The Mist Shard armorset is one of very few armor sets that actually look really good on medium armor.
---
I spent a few hours playing in the wardrobe and came up with [this (bonus character select screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/3TCGM8R).
---
I'm still questioning why you are writing homestuck but it isn't homestuck. Try something more original.
---
Ueugh why
---
Yeah. I think I'll just do everything except the currency stuff, come back later in a month and see if they changed it. If not, maybe I'll grind them eventually. But the Skyscale is quite disappointing anyway and I already have the Griffon.
---
Well Kralk had already been around for a while before The Pale Tree was even grown. The Pale Tree is also a seed of the jungle dragon, so the connection is *very* slim
---
Ok
---
This is only true for group content, open world it doesn't matter. In fact quite often the builds on snowcrows or godsofpvp are not good at all in the open world becuase those builds are optimised for the buffs that you get in group content.
---
My Weaver was geared for WvW roaming to mimic the pvp sage weaver in a lot of ways, it is what I also use for story/open world.
---
And then, there's Jimmy.
---
the respawn at malchor's is 2h though. farms respawn only after reset.
---
* Why not play an existing character?
---
* Why not salvage some of your stuff, scrape some items from your storage sell everything on TP, and get the slot from gold-gem conversion?
---
* things cost, that's just the way it is.
---
* yes, yes you are.
---
Thanks for that... I will never be able to play my Charr character again...
---
I wonder how she's doing. We haven't seen her in years.
---
&gt; there are 9 classes in the game with different build options but only like 5 distinct builds are played
---
Heavy armor: 1v1 spellbreaker, teamfight berserker, support firebrand, condition firebrand, core guardian, trap dragonhunter, power herald, (this one is cheese) condi renegade.  
---
Medium armor: core thief, staff daredevil, rifle deadeye, boon soulbeast, bunker druid, power core ranger/soulbeast, bunker scrapper, teamfight holosmith  
---
Light armor: condi mirage, power chrono, bunker weaver, fresh air weaver, support tempest, condi scourge, power reaper, and trollish condi minionmaster core necro.
---
You can say a lot, but definitely not that the current meta in ranked is stale and not diverse. Hell, there are viable builds for each core spec.
---
"Oh lord" is applicable to those 2 as well as OP. Jimmy is the only sane one here.
---
I am not a lesbian, you ignorant weeb.
---
Exactly this.  Your first character should be raised the traditional way to learn the class mechanics and skills, game combat and movement, etc.  You'll still be in for a shock with expansion content at 80 but you'll have a much easier time of it if you have a firm knowledge of the fundamentals.
---
Boosts are great for alts, or for taking the character the "last mile" and getting them an initial set of gear (though the stats aren't great at all).
---
Now thats a quality build.
---
#DON'T FORGET I EXIST.
---
Can someone explain?
---
so did you buy a 2nd perma sickle from the gem store to slot a reaper glyph in your logging axe or are you using the karma tools for your woodfarming?
---
That is not how balancing works.
---
You are nerfing/buffing skills and not builds. The effect on builds are the result of changes to those skills and those changes can throw certain builds completely out of the window or create completely new builds that didn't work before but now are working great.
---
Those builds are played because they work, why would you play a build that doesn't or only works in certain situations that probably never really happen?!
---
So buffing skills just for a build doesn't work or will most likely not result in what you want it to happen.
---
You can't look just at the builds but need to look at the skills and what changes mean to the game because you wouldn't want to create a synergy that is so OP just because you wanted to make a buff to a certain build.
---
Tie me up = Taimi, up. (as in Taimi, look up)
---
Small balance patches are fine as long as they are not insignificant. I agree on your point of view on not drawing competitive players but lately, PVP community is like extremely toxic and arrogant at the same time. If you try to play something not meta, for example a fresh air ele or condi core engi, people just cry at you with creative curse words. So I think, there is something wrong with Anet's peaceful attitude.
---
They mean their own game. Not Anet‚Äôs.
---
If you expect some miracle one click tool that will give you 60 FPS in clumped up fights then I got bad news for you since game isn't optimised in that regard, but on other hand you can disable extra character models in options which will significantly increase your performance
---
Yeah, it's pretty trash. Too limited, should probably just infinite flight.
---
also the dream must have always be there, because Mordremoth was controlling this sphere of magic. So mind magic is represented by the only outspring of Mordremoth - The Pale Tree.
---
Firebrand tome cooldown.
---
yeah, thats about the only application where this glyph on a chopping axe is viable for a cost of around 350g. I wouldnt even recommend using the karma tools for this since one rotation with 20 alts will cost you around 150k karma.
---
How self-sufficient are staff/sword alacrity renegades using zerker armor and diviner accessories in T4 fractals? Having a decent time on my Quickbrand which shares most of the same gear setup but find that I'm relying heavily on party mates for putting up reflects/stability, and especially healing as we blow our heal for quickness uptime.
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised they focussed on Aurene/Vlast and ignored the fact that the pale tree is essentially the uncorrupted child of an elder dragon like Glint.
---
I think it may also be since you still think in the way of "I got dmg stats so my dmg should be fine now I can build in more defense/healing" but in gw2 you got some options you either go full dmg and try to avoid dmg with dodge etc or you go dmg and get mobility out of your traits like fresh air with the superspeed trait making you incredibly fast when in combat and pretty bursty or you can play a generalist for example sword/dagger or dagger/dagger or even sword/focus with gear and traits giving you something of everything and doing mostly a rotation.
---
1. Mount. I have to purchase the game to acquire one of these yes? What level do I have to be after purchasing?
---
2. When levelling I have done the level appropriate zone to 100 percent then moved on. In the beginning my levels matched nicely with the completion rate. Now I am 39 and getting close to completing zone 35 to 45 even tho I am spamming events and such. What do I do when my next heart is lvl let's say 44 and I am 40? Where do I get xp apart from events.
---
3. If I go to a lower lvl zone I get scaled down. Doing hearts and bounties here gives me same xp as if I was in a zone appropriate for my true level? Yes or no?
---
Do the meta over and over since there doesnt seem to be a cap on it. You can hop maps for the meta, especially now since the map is crowded.
---
Map completion isnt worth it. It awards 5 shards, which is less then the meta.
---
Looks like a fractured skimmer skeleton.
---
Very good summary, thank you for writing it down.
---
how does this work. I dont see an increased range for gathering.
---
Completely agree with you. I have no qualms with the collections being timegated, but it feels that we are rewarded unequally with a subpar mount whose functions have been fulfilled by the other mounts.
---
I feel like this episode has a lot more ups than downs and the new mount is at the bottom most of that spectrum. It feels like a very well-planned collection with a mount that is not well thought out, and I'm disappointed with that honestly.
---
My suggestions for the buffs are:
---
- Latching needs to be reworked
---
- Flying speed should increase after using dash
---
- 3 endurance bars
---
I'd avoid tampering with the flight juice for now because I feel it will kill the Springer entirely if we tune it up too much.
---
Also we should sound out during the upcoming stream. It's probably the best channel to vent our frustrations with the mount.
---
&gt; Inscribed shards, you get **5** from **1** vendor. 
---
Also only 5 shards from map completion, but 25 on the other maps as far as I've seen.
---
I will probably never understand why people are acting like as if losing a competitive match is a matter of life and death. I understand anger and destructive criticism such as "You suck", yeah I mean I can suck, I might play bad, but "hope you get cancer" is something else...
---
No, but they can make it so the skyscale is the easiest (or second easiest, behind griffon) way from one point to another by way of flight paths containing volatile magic, while still giving a normal path for those who only have the basic four mounts.
---
Really struggling today with this. Kept wanting to land so I could charge energy and jump, but then he latched on. I *Know* the griffon would have just landed there too :(
---
Make me unsee what I see in my head now
---
Champ rest pass comes from mAT so it has nothing to do with current rate/rank since they are different types of PvP 
---
AT/mAT = real PvP with team comp and voice 
---
Ranked = pip farm randomway mode 
---
Champ rest comes from real PvP
---
Off the top of my head, you could:
---
Fly up to skybox on infinite SkyScale near a JP but outside mount restriction zone.
---
Switch to griffon by jumping off skyscale, glide then mount griffon
---
Use griffon until close to restricted zone and use the #8 skill to leap forward. 
---
Fall to end of JP
---
use revive orb to res up
---
HOWEVER
---
I do think that freedom of trueflight is worth the risk of people cheesing a few more JP which can't already be cheesed with mounts...
---
cant you also get a 2 week pass by being top 15 in ranked queue or something though?
---
People cant see sarcasm from text. I know that more then enough from my time on reddit and all those downvotes. Dont worry about it. Its just karma and nothing more. 
---
Guildes are ment for reddit and other web pages like dulfy and others . Wiki is there because its linked right into the game itself. While trying /wiki [&amp;AgGIYQEA] 
---
You will find that there is incomplete page. Ofcorse its something new but that is why we are trying to write it all down. 
---
The only problem is that you can find ID of achievements. This achievement is 4668 in the list. If you will look at it you can see that there are 28 "items" marked as part of the collection . But when you will try to look at these items you wil only get "  "text": "no such id"  ". That means we cant get any informations about the item from the API. The only way is from game itself. But for that we would need the access to it. We are no Anet admins . We dont have any cheat codes . We are players like you who just spend some time to help others by updating the wiki. We cant update it for others when we dont know what we should write there. So that is why Im asking others for help.
---
Thank you. I if understand well what "neat" means. xD
---
I don't need it myself. Just like Serpents' Ire, it's a thing I keep thinking about from time to time. It was hard for me to gather people, so I assume it can be a hard time for some people... Conclusion, I try to gather adventurers to help them. (-:
---
And to share a good moment.
---
That sounds disappointing. Thank you for your report.

Stroke on your font is hard to apply dude /s
---
&gt; For one, at least half the time gate is feeding your dragon.
---
I don't think the complains are regarding those timegates (though, they are often bundled with the real issue) as it is more a lockout (you are only locked after you fed it at least a few times) and this one is pretty well integrated.
---
Moreover, proper lockouts (cooldowns) are already a feature of many other collections and game aspects.
---
The criticism started day 1 and were about the timegate between collections.
---
what is this? a skyscale for ants? the head has to be at least three times bigger than this!
---
I got a Logitech mouse with 6 additional buttons on the top surface it's a huge help and no weird thumb buttons.
---
From the wiki 'Two week passes are earned through top four placement in Monthly Automated Tournaments or through top 25 **placement in a PvP League.'**
---
Also consider investing in buying Karmic Retribution in any enemy-populated maps. It helped me to boost my karma very fast. I in particular like Sandswept Isles karmic retribution due to large number of mobs during pre-meta event. Also I can see this working out well in Domain of Istan.
---
Hey Shiny girl. What is that 'restricted archives' at the title? Can't find anything about it and would like to shine just as bright as you do! Enlight me please.
---
Looks awesome by the way!
---
I'll try to dig something up or see if i can make one myself.
---
I am with you on the clunkiness of trying to land instead of sticking to a surface. Skyscale's a little bit too magnetic for wall clinging.
---
Lets see if i can explain better (not really my best set of skills):
---
You don't use the Skyscale when you want to travel far, given enough airspace for the Griffon or sufficient flat terrain for the Beetle. But you also wouldn't use any other mount in this situation. They're not the optimal pick.
---
You don't use the Skyscale to scale flat, easy cliffs that have been designed for the Springer. If the Skyscale would be the better pick in Springer's home turf, there'd be something wrong.
---
But! Whenever the conditions are not ideal like this, the Skyscale provides a new way of overcoming them, offering more convenient and / or faster travel.
---
All situations in which the Griffon is only used as a better glider without dive boost - Skyscale is faster and offers more precision.
---
Situations in which scaling something with the Springer gets really tricky because of small landing surfaces, stuff in your jump path blocking you, higher jumps required than the Springer can manage, or because more horizontal movement is required than the Springer can cross. The Skyscale opens up more climbing paths this way and can be faster and / or more precise in existing ones, e.g. preventing you from slipping because you missed by two millimeters.
---
Situations in which you find yourself constantly swithing between Springer and Griffon to diminish each of the mount's downsides. These situations are typically a mix of the previously mentioned. You save Bond of Faith for other uses and are less reliant on it.
---
And regarding the LS3 map masteries... if you actually had a mount that moves faster than the thermal tubes launch you or can easily climb vertically faster than oakheart essences launch you, it'd be outright broken. Any of these outclass any of the mounts - oakheart essences make the Springer just as obsolete as the Skyscale for pure vertical gain. Thus i wouldn't count them, i'd only compare within the eight mounts.
---
I love getting where i want when i want and the way i want. Sure, the Springer might be better used a good few units further around this cliff, but the Skyscale allows me to really live out my fetish for bruteforcing my way somewhere instead of going the intended route.

---
I remember that there was an add-on for gw2 that provides smoother fps by using a different setting, anyone has any idea which one it is? Also is anyone getting random fps crashes in dragonfall?
---
For core maps (+LS2) you get the starter zone waypoints (like any character) plus [3 Waypoints](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Level_80_Waypoints_Unlocked). Since using a level 80 boost get you to the Silverwastes I think you also get this map "for free".
---
Since you're in the Silverwastes you can get to HoT pretty easily and then have to walk through the maps by yourself. You can also use a HoT guild hall to go to VB or AB by exiting through the front door of the hall.
---
For LS3/LS4 you can buy Portal Scrolls on each map (1k LS3/LS4 magic + 50s, account bound, unlimited use) that can port any of you character: [Bllodstone Fen Portal Scroll](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Fen_Portal_Scroll) for example. You can also buy a [LS3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_3_Portal_Tome)/[LS4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_4_Portal_Tome) Tome to store all the Scrolls of a season that you have in a single object (your bank will thank you).
---
For PoF you need to either do the 1st instance of the story to get to the Crystal Oasis or use the PoF Guild Hall to end up in Vabbi. This Guild Hall technique is very useful for PoF because getting on a map automatically unlocks the 1st waypoint of said map: you can do Exit Guild hall --&gt; port to Vabbi 1st WP --&gt; walk 5 meters to get to Desolation --&gt; port to Desolation 1st WP --&gt; etc until Crystal Oasis (you'll still have to do the Crystal Oasis --&gt; Desert Highland by foot).
---
r/thingsforants
---
Good, I will have 2, mail to Mistlock Sanctuary, please.
---
&gt; The Sylvari are also Minions of Mordremoth.
---
Technically not true, the Mordrem Guard are his minions proper. Sylvari are the free-willed spawn of a *cleansed* dragon minion/champion though which is close enough in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt; The Dream is the unconscious mind of all Sylvari, you could view it some form of pool of the pale tree which stores all of the memories of all sylvari that have ever lived and every new born sylvari gets a portion of this pool.
---
The Dream seems to supersede the Pale Tree considering Mordremoth was also proficient in using it. I presume it to be a manifestation of the Domain of Mind, possibly Mordremoth's hivemind or something similar to Kralk's "shared resonance" with his minions. This is *worse* news for OP though, because the Pale Tree does not even control the Dream.
---
&gt; Omadds Machine does show a Tree in the middle but such a depiction is a widespread thing in mythologies and used as a tree of life.
---
Since the Pale Tree also has prophetic visions (A Light in the Darkness) and her status as a cleansed dragon champion is similar to Glint's (plants biologically reproduce via seeds so the Pale Tree could even be Mordy's actual daughter) that vision might also have been a different version of Glint's Legacy, the Pale Tree's desire to break the ED cycle with herself filling the role of Crystal Dragon Jesus Aurene.
---
Or the vision was tuned to Scarlet who probably *did* see the Pale Tree as "the centre of the world" whether she approved of that at the time or not.
---
I can already break several jp with griffon and bond of faith.
---
We get empty artsy set-pieces marketed as content
---
I hope Anet addresses this in the upcoming days. The Skyscale stream that is happening tomorrow sounds like the perfect chance for them to do that.
---
Not trying to sound like a whiner but going around six total maps to gather 250 of every currency is just not fun. It feels like a chore and people are getting burned out from it.
---
 A reduction, like I said, would be a fantastic change. As I said before 100-150 currency would be the sweetspot imo. Hell even 50 would be passable. The beetle required 50 of Kourna‚Äôs currency so why not the Skyscale? No, Skyscale isn‚Äôt a legendary item/mount by any means but Anet is trying to pass it off as one.
---
Oh, maybe skyscale will make it easier to enter the dunngeon even if it‚Äôs contested
---
Yes this helps a lot . Thank you . And if you can make one for Riding Skyscales as well then that would be awesome. Just the descriptions are missing only.
---
&gt;the endurance fed dash ability for ascension. You can use that angular.
---
Good point. Thanks for the tip!
---
About as bad as people only dyeing their gear with exclusive dyes.
---
Guess I learn something new everyday (the AP doesn‚Äôt show it and I‚Äôve never been top 25 to actually know)
---
I do know about getting pass from tourney tho
---
Your character isn't *that* ugly.
---
If it exists, r/de will "translate" it. For the better or worse.
---
Like the G300? I have the G700 currently, but that only has 3 buttons with easy reach on the top and the back one is hard to press consistently. The G300 setup seems better in this regard.
---
2nd ability on griffon is actually dive.
---
You can check /r/GuildRecruitment. Alternatively you regularly have (at least in EU) LFGs of guilds trying to start raid roasters looking for people of various experience (so they will probably be chill).
---
If you are rather new to GW2 raiding you may also want to start by big raid communities that can teach people like [those communities](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) (link has NA and EU communities). Those ones are mostly English-speaking but it very possible to find similar structures if you'd prefer another language. Communities may help you meet like-minded people with whom you may want to start a roaster of your own.
---
The Skyscale doesn't like those, to stay polite.
---
Like the Griffon, it shares the issue of being unable to use its abilities downwards. Griffon cant dive and with the Skyscale you are pretty much locked on your current height level.
---
But it gets worse. The fuel calculations don't care for gravity, only for your starting point, so if you take off, you float up, reach your height limit, fuel gets drained and gravitational pull increases, ultimately keeping you stuck in one height because you can't go up or down.
---
Avoid low grav areas like the ones you mentioned or the brand tornado. Also avoid being forcibly moved any direction, the Skyscale doesn't like that. Mount the Griffon instead for these situations.
---
It begins!
---
My guild in NA does raids every Friday/Saturday, and we're definitely not uh... Hardcore. I think some of us would like to raid more often but we need more people interested in regularly raiding to do so.
---
Isn't berserker considered a condi class with low burst but high DPS? I am getting old am i not?
---
*makes sure to flex on dem newbies*
---
I think you are thinking of [d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy), if you have never installed/used it I would recommend that you read the full readme before jumping to the installation instructions so that you are aware of what it is doing.
---
Not sure if this helps with your OCD, but if you bind keys for your frequently used mounts, you don't have to use the menu.

Some people are like that, most aren't luckily, we just can't expect everyone to be a balanced human being.
---
6 years is definitely not a newbie...
---
This will depress a lot of new players.
---
Indeed if you are solo only power Chrono can do more, ofc if you run a very specific build warrior or guardian can also do nice damage but without the survivability.
---
How lovely, going to have to check it out with my character. At least it's a tasteful use of infusion rather than 30 of them stacked just for the sake of it.
---
It will also depress certain players who have been playing for 6 years, 3 months, who still haven't gotten around to crafting a single legendary and has yet to finish an ascended set and that person is DEF not me üòÇ

It awards 25 the wiki is wrong there
---
Wow, that's new! I really haven't played in a while. It says guaranteed, but also "random", so I'm assuming I can't just pick the outfit I want?
---
Elder scrolls has dead gods becoming celestial bodies... It's not an exclusive concept to wow and I'm sure other fantasy properties have played around with the idea.
---
I'd like to see it go a bit faster than the griffon's base speed by default. The griffon should outpace it after a dive, but it could stand to be a tiny bit faster maintaining a consistent pace.
---
Killing the rats is a much faster way to complete that heart, talk to the heart dude to get a warhorn and use the skills when targeting a nest, sometimes the rats spawn underground and are invulnerable, but not untargetable, so you can spam the skill on the same mob without it dying. Easy heart.
---
&gt; Sylvari are the free-willed spawn of a cleansed dragon minion/champion though which is close enough in the grand scheme of things.
---
In season 2 this is clearly stated from Wynne at the end of Point of no return:
---
&gt; "We come from the jungle dragon. We belong to it. We're meant to serve it." [Source](https://youtu.be/GP0WsOMed-o?t=63)
---
So Sylvari originate from Mordremoth and the Mordrem are twisted and corrupted Plantlike Minions of Mordremoth.
---
&gt; The Dream seems to supersede the Pale Tree considering Mordremoth was also proficient in using it.
---
Since the Sylvari originate from Mordremoth this pretty much explains itself. Whatever the dream is, mordremoth, as originator of the Sylvari could tap into it and influence the Sylvari.
---
&gt; her status as a cleansed dragon champion
---
Do you have any source for that because while the comparison makes sense I don't think this applies here.
---
Almost 6 years for one legendary? ... Filthy casual, nothing more.
---
I pray for jimmy
---
Exactly. It randomly chooses one of the skins you do not have unlocked yet.
---
You also can get their with the griffon and you can get to the chair in Champions Rest pass Right above the brawl arena just with the springer however move one inch further than the chair and you get kicked out, same with the exclusive brawl arena you can get there however if you try to enter the champions rest you‚Äòll eventually get kicked there as well
---
Woah boy, ok, that's a 1/1000 chance then. Jeez. I'm all for grinding, but that might actually take me until Halloween to do.
---
I mean it could be pretty obvious. Her egg was fostered in an environment where the laylines were wild and zhaitans essence was exposed. The world had different properties, not to mention the fact that she is the a 2nd generation purified elder dragon so her relationship with life is different. She could just have extreme willpower... And anime friendships also = power. Lol
---
Hey thanks
---
It's good to see them add in more armor  types that you actually  play content  to get rather than throwing more dev work towards outfits, I mean the arguement  can be made that you can grind for outfits through content  but it just doesnt have that same feeling of targeting  certain  events and playing specific  pieces  of content  and  having that feeling  of satisfaction  when you unlock it. I hope that they do more of this in the next content  releases
---
You can force this "bug" by standing behind a object as casting, it has the same effect ;)
---
Wait isn't that the light legendary Pants?
---
Returning player here after almost 4years, are [my gear](https://imgur.com/RxkRkqA) still relevant(All my gear are zojja)? I left sometime after HoT release so Im kinda confused on what I should do as of now. Should I make a new character and replay the game?
---
Yeah I get that but I also am a bit miffed about how getting legendarys isnt prestigious and can be done by everyone except f2ps I mere seconds :(
---
It depresses me, somebody who's been playing since launch and still doesn't have a legendary.
---
Damn short necros.
---
I like to be on declining canopy to hatch on 45 degree surface and... be like ok... dismount then.
---
Also Skyscale wing flight animation is such a rubber. Its pure trash if you compare it to Griffon.
---
Excellent first choice, too! Congrats!
---
/r/guildrecruitment is pretty dead and there doesn't seem to be any good active raid training guilds. Try the following:
---
1. Join the raid training discords on https://www.snowcrows.com/raids/training/ applicable to your mega server, then just network from there.   
---
2. Look in LFG, there seems to always be some people recruiting for a static.
---
It is fun trying to play a Where's Waldo and find yourself in this pic. That was possibly the fastest I've ever killed Mark II before.
---
You can work on getting your character to 80 and play with other looks until then! Halloween will be here before you know it!
---
I'm so far from triggered it's not even funny. I enjoy banter, sorry to tell you.
---
Never, EVER use a guaranteed wardrobe unlock until you've acquired all the cheap skins, dyes and other unlockables that can be obtained easily from drops, renown hearts and repeatable rewards, or chances are it'll go to waste unlocking something like an iron mace or privateer coat.
---
I watched summary of LS1 before playing LS2 to have continuity of the story and since the start I have so mixed feeling about her. Her condotion seems so forced way to feel sorry for her, on the other hand her relationship with Phlunt and other asuras like him in LS2/HoT was the thing that made me symphatise her. Still, I hate she's the genius that can solve everything that requires thinking, and I know I would hate it even more if my main was an asura.
---
She has her funny moments and irritating moments, but story wise I hope her worsening condition is not fake drama that will be miracoulusly solved but real drama and letting her go.
---
Accounts were wiped at launch and between betas.
---
If you enjoy it then why complain about it? Doesn't seem to make sense.
---
I still don't get it, maybe I'll try tomorrow..
---
I am playing since beta, I have 450li+ lvl 100 fractal completion with cm's. I don't mean to brag, but I think I have enough experience with the game. I struggle and work hard for legendary stuff, since I enjoy the game rather than farm :D
---
those.. were always there..
---
I'm with you. Crafting stuff is so boring to me.
---
&gt;handholding
---
lewd!
---
Mesmer portals, the raid portal and tp to friend are there too.
---
When I did the JP part of the collection I don't think I did a single JP properly. I abused mounts and gliding on half of them and the rest mesmers helped with portals.
---
:3
---
Seriously? If you're not scared of dying, then why argue against permanent no down state? Unless you're scared of dying. Or unless you think you won't beat the enemy..
---
Same here, though I was captured by her voice actress more than anything :D
---
Also Canach grew on me over time, he's so well written. Finally a tart sylvari.
---
Owo
---
That is why Armistice Bastion is superior lounge now. No PvE mounts.
---
How tf do i get a legendary in 2 weeks?  Ive played for a while , never aimed at legrndary but never had the gold either
---
For some like me the desire to have something is the urge. Either I get it soon or burn out and feel bad for not having what I want. Some of us are just illogical *shrug
---
Excuse me?
---
That's a misconception. She wasn't in the center of the vision in Omadd's Machine. She was the 'gateway' to the vision with the 8 orbs in The All. 
---
What's the cinematic again, carefully:   
---
https://youtu.be/OQGGytoNXk8
---
You can see the commander doesn't stay with the tree for long, and the 'branches' of the tree stay behind when the commander enters that 'tunnel' of sorts and gets launched forward.  
---
This hints that the tree is a representation of the Dream, and the machine makes the commander go through the Dream to see The All. 
---
If you look at the 8 orbs in the cinematic, the central one is a white orb the same size as the other 6 colored orbs, but it's inside a larger orb with lots of bright specks scattered all over it.  
---
If Kralkatorrik and the other dragons had the same Mother and he was not referring to the 6th water dragon, his 'mother 'was likely the central white orb inside the translucent orb.   
---
What is that exactly? I suspect 1 of two possibiilities: 
---
 * "Mother" is a very ancient dragon sleeping somewhere in the Depths of Tyria.
---
 * Tyria itself being a dragon that over the years has been covered with debris from the mists until she became a planet, but Leylines are still her blood vessels, ley energy her blood, and leystone her flesh, and we'll have to figure out a way to keep her sleeping, or something like [this](https://youtu.be/pHOnGSFzd3Y) could happen to the world.
---
Time AND wallets
---
Dude.
---
***WHY WOULD YOU SHARE THIS? NOW IT'S GOING TO BE PATCHED.***
---
I personally think that they should let people interact with the TPS you can't use. That's anets problem though.
---
Your problem is posting player names on the sub, wouldn't recommend that.
---
people really should be comparing the skyscale to the springer instead of the griffon, since "going up" is what it excels at
---
Still need my skyscale because time-gate
---
Delete this pls
---
2nd generation like Glint.
---
Aurene is 3rd generation
---
I guess we'll need a Sylvari to turn into a dragon.
---
If you're talking about map completion, I only got 5, not 25
---
Did you just assume my state of calm? I'm as calm as a python doing his python things.
---
I'm really curious about Anet's design there. Not a single person is going to go out and harvest that much wood, whether by cutting down trees or salvaging loot. The only reasonable way to get that much wood is to buy it.
---
I actually love the idea for the dismount! Maybe make it an area of affect skill so you can control where the dragon is attacking (no buffs to the range, think of yourself as a circle and the aoe is another circle that is linked to you and can go 360 around but not outwards)
---
That is was I said, if it did not have radial support I would not use it, but it does.
---
You can already go from A to B on a Griffon. Distance or height isnt an issue. Griffin and Springer combo with crystal champion masteries make skyscale obsolete with the exception of wall climbing. Beyond that, it's just a glorified glider. They might as well made climbing an actual glider skill which would have been better than skyscale in it's current state as taking updrafts then mounting skyscale does not reset red flight meter penalty and sends you plummeting vs just using a griffon for more height or even a plain glider.
---
Skyscale needs a rework. There are too many things wrong with the flight meter that make it more cumbersome than liberating as all mounts up until now have been.
---
Playing for 2 years and I have 5 legendary.  There is literally nothing else to do besides craft them.
---
Map completion for Kourna only gives you 5 shards.
---
https://i.imgur.com/hoEESCn.jpg
---
is more like, i logged in for the first time X years ago.
---
$400 is going to buy me at least 4th place at the mAT?
---
That sounds like pretty much every update, ever, honestly.
---
People complain, talk about how they can't wait to move on to something else, etc. And then in a year or two, when there's brand new content to hate on, they suddenly start talking about the old content as if it was great stuff that they really miss.
---
Nobody is asking for WoW style mounts. Those are boring.
---
This comment is just like all the ones saying we want skyscale for free when everyone wants to just work for it instead of wait kinda like wow player do with gearscore based progression instead of actually playing the game.
---
Come back next week so you can get your next gear drop. Your ilvl is too low for this discussion.
---
Nope, not in sPvP.
---
Brrooooo, agreed 200%! I just can't get into MMOs anymore because of things like this. GW 2 is the last one I really put time into.
---
From far away, it almost looks like that player on the raptor is sitting backwards while reading a book üòÇ
---
It takes multiple years to get a legendary in this game? I just started playing, using F2P version to see if I like it, and that sounds pretty un-fun.
---
There will always be a best spec, you can play any spec you want.
---
Now this makes me want to get the skydoggo
---
It doesn't, op is just either extremely casual or didn't have knowledge about what to do. I've played less than a year, granted I play quite a lot, and I've crafted 2 legendary weapons, 1 armor set and a backpack.
---
Apart from the 25 shard nodes you can find on the map per day, there's hidden chests behind beetle walls and in the Inquest lab for example.
---
&gt;Some of the minions that had more of Zhaitan's juice inside them still act as if Zhaitan was alive, and control other unbound risen, so those likely had at least some basic instructions like "Guard this spot" or "Patrol the area", and are stuck doing that.
---
Referring to Tequatl the Sunless with this right?
---
Nope, got 5 yesterday.
---
Is it me or after getting your first legendary, the following ones seem easier to get?
---
That sounds actually pretty chill :p
---
No. As an established player I could probably churn out couple of months if I played a lot, or even wanted to make so many.
---
My rule of thumb is 500 hours for your first, which is a lot, then maybe half or a third of that for subsequent ones.
---
The OP either wasn't working on it the whole time (Most likely) or plays a couple hours a week.
---
badmouthing things, wont make them better or worse
---
Yeah but it's a pain to hit the enter button before you get booted out. If there's a sweet spot to hover and get the dialog without being teleported, that's really convenient.
---
&gt; Complete the minigame. You have to go sequentially 3 times, you cannot just jump to hard. You can set the Adolescent Skyscale as a target with default keybindings Ctrl+T to make it easier to find (commander tag markers do not work). The Skyscale stays within the event field marked on your minimap and there is no time limit.
---
As an addition. I found that if you just select it once, then the skyscale will be deselected once it goes to hide again. So, what you want to do is untarget the skyscale (There are other creatures you can target) and then *re-target* the skyscale just before you run up and trigger the "Found you!".
---
It runs better. Its honestly not even close. I did this last night.
---
A guild vs guild open world pvp toggle or mode could be cool I think a pvp mode in the open world would be awesome they could set it up like a meta event on different  maps within the world and give people a reason  to go back to older content, you could incentivize it with loot bags or rare 
---
Gathering  nodes or double resources  from gathering  while your guild controls the map
---
Set small goals that all lead to the legendary, and work on those. Once you've met a couple of them, the rest goes quicker.
---
The beetle truly is *amazing*. Zipping around just about anywhere is wonderful!
---
Delet dis
---
It‚Äôs intentional, it‚Äôs their whole business model. It‚Äôs actually quite clever, in the face of subscription MMOs and MMOs with rampant pay to win micro transactions (which admittedly Anet has a little bit of but you need a significant amount of money to really gain any proper advantage.) Anet creates gear that would take somebody a very long time and great effort to obtain without buying gems to convert into gold, but is still obtainable through gameplay without paying any real world currency nonetheless. Meanwhile you could easily just put in a few extra hours at your real world job, buy a couple hundred dollars worth of gems, convert that into gold, and either buy the legendary itself, or purchase the materials to make one.
---
If that‚Äôs not a solid business strategy, then I don‚Äôt know what is. The supply and demand is there. People fall to the temptation all the time. I personally know plenty of people in game who have dropped a good chunk of change on legendaries, so many in fact that I hardly ever actually believe anybody when they say that they crafted one, I just assume that they bought it and are lying for attention.
---
This is in Jahai, not Kourna.
---
https://i.imgur.com/zbMi10r.jpg
---
It doesn't really! I've played since launch and thought the same- that it would take years and years so I didn't have any legendaries at all until late last year when I actually "wanted" them. .....and right now I have a complete legendary armor, Bolt, Warbringer and Aurora. And I'm halfway done Nevermore. and this is from 2-3 hours a day of playing the past couple of months.
---
Mostly to [Kingpins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Unchained_Kingpin), but also Tequatl, yes.
---
My understanding is that the developer's concern has little to do with breaking the game in the sense of making things exploitable and much, much more to do with breaking the game as an experience.
---
You can always add an invisible wall or a mounts-prohibited zone or some other such thing to address people using the mount to break jumping puzzles or gain an advantage of some kind. That's easy.
---
What's you can't really address is everyone flying around all the time so that they never experience the maps, so that zones feel empty unless you point your camera up, so that nobody is doing most of the content on a map but only flying between major objectives. 
---
In other words, true flight would mean essentially bypassing, not every aspect of the game, but significant portions of the game. It would be almost like *removing content*, not in the strict sense since it would still be there for people to do if they ever decided to, but in the practical sense that very few people would ever actually do any of it anymore.
---
but that's the thing. The Skyscale is already made obsolete by the Griffon and Springer - I literally do not see a reason to ever use the Skyscale over the springer or griffon in any scenario, especially because of the extremely overzealous restrictions it has.
---
I took the skyscale with full masteries and closed the rift, took every magic orb and made it to the other rift. The mastery text for Rift Repair mentions a treasure at the end, but I don't see anything. 
---
[Here is me at the end of the magic trail, the rift is not that visible, but I am right at it](https://imgur.com/a/yjfqjUi)
---
What am suppposed to do?
---
????? WAT????
---
man the level of salt on poor people is so high
---
Bless your soul.
---
TIL!
---
Still worth it.
---
I think people had higher expectations because of the long collection. Not saying they‚Äôre right but I can understand their frustration
---
no let it stay cursed &gt;:(
---
So you're saying, you're giving this joke a NO.
---
I absolutely agree, let people cheese it if they want. Reward creativity!
---
JP are great fun sometimes, but the rewards are not worth holding back the potential of the skyscape for.
---
Even then it'll still be relevant after the 28th since the saddle collection is a headache and a half.
---
No more than doubling the flight meter. I have no issues personally with how it is now though.
---
I mean I made Kudzu beck when you needed to mystic forge the thing and I still use it daily. I love that skin.
---
It's basically like doing the older legendaries lolz.
---
I'm kinda used to it by now.
---
It's a glorified glider with wall climbing.
---
Griffon + Springer + Crystal Champion masteries make skyscale obsolete outside of wall climbing.
---
Basically what I think when I see comments like this, it won‚Äôt hurt you to be nice to someone lol.
---
That's kinda like complaining that Iron Man or Shuri can come up with solutions to complex problems that stump other people. 
---
Or, hell, that our characters can literally kill a God while it takes entire armies to fight off some zombies or Branded. 
---
Taimi is repeatedly described as being smart beyond her years. She has been working on dragon magic for longer than anyone alive, at this point. We learned that she wrote a thesis on dragon biology, and it's the preeminent work on dragons at this point in time. She is literally the **best** in the world at what she does, and this world literally has magic infused technology. It is not at all surprising, or unbelievable *in the world the story has built over the course of 5 years* that Taimi can whip up a gadget that (still, only partially) solves a dragon-related energy problem.
---
&gt;250 shards
---
doubting that amount
---
This is the perfect mount for collecting volatile/unbound magic clusters in maps where they may be too difficult with the griffon. They've even made it a point to illustrate it with the achievements. I look forward to visiting maps where this was too time consuming to do once I get the mount. You can also essentially keep your progress in flight paths if you need to look something up.
---
Yes, using several masteries from the springer, griffon, and bond of faith, which require more micromanagement and mastery investment, can be an alternative for many occasions. But if you have to move up within a winding fissure where you have no room to fly without losing momentum and no nearby ledges, this will be the solution.
---
Berserker is still best for Thief/Daredevil/Deadeye, yes. Raids might be after you stopped playing, I'm not sure, but it's 10-man instances that you fight through. The first raid wing has Vale Guardian, Spirit Run, Gorseval, and Sabetha.
---
By making sure that the Skyscale will not overshadow the Griffon &amp; Springer, they ended up gimping the Skyscale instead. So yeah, I hope they will rework it.
---
&gt;mastered the mobile phone game thing where you get sucked into playing every day even though you don't like it
---
This is probably the most accurate way I've heard it described in terms of how it feels. Even now after I have had my spirit crushed by this grind I am still thinking about the mount and how I am pretty close to being done with it all considering how much work I already had to put in. 
---
It's like they knew by the time everyone really wanted to quit this collection it would be too late because of the time/resources they had already invested.
---
Yeah, I just got to that part yesterday. It really is like a legendary but in mount form. 250 of each map currency really rustled my jimmies.
---
Isn‚Äôt it light? The eyes are obvious.
---
But then it's kinda your own fault I think.
---
All those Gifts aren't for nothing!
---
You can do hearts repeatedly on different characters.  For zones with easy hearts (Kourna, Jahai) that's a very good source of the currencies.  In Jahai, the first-time rift event rewards of 5 Mistonium each are also character-based, so if you rotate several characters through you can get a lot of Mistonium in a single day.
---
Exord.
---
The Griffon is far easier to obtain though, even if it "costs" more in gold. This is far more frustrating to get, even when the time gates are lowered, so it'll most likely cause people to not even bother or even stop mid way through when they see the requirements. Just like how we don't see thousands of Aurora users running around. Things like the Chalice jumping puzzle and the fact that it's a "Legendary" put people off of getting that. Ascended accessories are easier to obtain so they pay the map currency to get an Ascended Trinket instead rather than go through the process to get Aurora. The Griffon is easier to get than the Skyscale so we'll always see more Griffons.
---
And I was SO RELIEVED that Dragonfall had no hearts, repeatable or otherwise! Of course it would mean that we'd be forced to go back to do OLD repeatable hearts! Argh!
---
There is a laziness factor to it as well, but for me, I'd also rather be doing something else entirely than messing with crafting. Standing around and feeding things into a blender is just not to my general gaming tastes.
---
Poor Tiami
---
Skyscale for sure not, I'm also quite sure about Griffon and I have no idea for beetle. But I'd expect you don't need any of those to get spirit shards.
---
Yep, all of the stuff is still in gw2.dat. Every voice acting, music, maps, textures, models. Everything.
---
Why would maps in season 5 have volatile magic, when that was created by kralk, and that's unlikely to be a problem now?
---
last time i Played gw2 was in 2015 before HoT came out.  HoT never interested me but PoF does.  Can someone skip HoT and play Pof? would storyline make sense?
---
I think I have stopped playing before that. But thanks for the info :)
---
Same problem here
---
Skyscale has precision, can go higher than springer + griffon without depending on diving or bond abilities (which have a long cooldown), and will probably have more use cases in future maps.
---
Going to be honest, after seeing the full on break down on what's required...i kinda wish this was for a legendary amulet, trinket, or ring.  Kinda lame this is just for another mount.  But hey i guess mounts sell skins soooo....
---
Ah I see...Looks like I have a lot of catching up to do XD
---
Yep, was only a matter of time until someone tried it
---
I'm gonna be honest: I bought it just to be able to gather faster in objectives during WvW zerging, without the commander pressing on without me :)
---
Send me your ingame name, I'll add you tonight :)
---
At least the rabbit can stand on small edges, the skyscale just latches on /gg
---
\&gt; then I actually saw what goes into making a legendary and I learned the real problem is I'm a lazy lil potato oops. 
---
GASP I had NO idea! üòÖ
---
Most of the gold value you are farming while the game comes in crafting materials, so there is a good chance that you just deposit a good chunk of your daily earnings into your material storage. So it might be worth checking out the value of your whole material storage by logging into apps like gw2efficiency.com or gw2bltc.com with an API key.
---
Uhh I do this with griff as it stands anyway
---
I made 3 legends in 6 months, playing 2-3 hours a day
---
Daily T4 fractals go a long way for a short time investment (once you're good at them). Meta runs on profitable maps like Auric Basin can be farmed.
---
Youtube a goldmaking guide, there's a ton of them already.
---
*que smash bros theme*
---
That's a bug it can take days to go away unless you contact support. I've had it numerous times
---
Whaaaat? Tempest is still my go-to for open world content. Sure, reaper does more damage faster without dying, but it gets a bit boring after a while and GS is so slow. Tempest feels much more satisfying, but each to their own.
---
It's not that the dash is draining your FJ, it's the fact that you are traversing outside your current flight zone. If you dash down then you will hardly lose any flight juice. I don't think you quite understand how it works.
---
If you don't feel the need to use it, then don't use it. Mounts in GW2 are not supposed to be better than each other, but provide a different use than each other.
---
The ONLY thing they should address is how base elevation is set, because currently it's set the moment you leave the ground, regardless of if you are mounted or not. I can see why they did it this way - to prevent sky box abuse due to some updrafts, leylines, lava tubes, etc; but, it still feels bad.
---
I haven't spent tons of time in the skyscale saddle, but am left wondering at the utility of wall grappling? What is it good for?
---
&gt; instead of its sole use being an AFK helicopter?
---
You‚Äôve been using it wrong if that‚Äôs the only use you saw. The skyscale is extremely flexible to move around, it gives more control than what people think.
---
Unfortunately you won't get good advice here or mostly anywhere online simply because: if I tell you how to make bank in a day, everyone will do it, saturating the market and now I can't make bank in a day anymore.
---
I mean... that sounds like something a French noble would have said during the revolution.
---
I've crafted 4 of the 14 I have. The others I bought outright. At least _some_ real money went in to purchasing more than a few of them, but not all of them. And I've never spent even half of what's necessary to flat out buy a Legendary, which I believe is a couple hundred (Canadian) or maybe some where around 150$?  
---
But yeah I'd say you're very right. I think a lot of people just buy them as it's a lot easier if you have the money or gold to do so.
---
There is a god awful amount of misinformation and baseless bias spread, its actually unbelievable.
---
Do i really need to go around and record clips as hard evidence how the Skyscale trumps Springer and Griffon in those areas it was designed for?
---
Buffing the Skyscale would actually drive out the Springer even in its home turf of flat, easy to jump on cliffs.
---
Yep but that no longer matters
---
I plead the fifth.
---
Well i mean do the daily and you gain 60 gold each month only from that. Fractals (make sure to get the masteries for it) will give you a lot of gold too. So if you had not started yet then you have 100 levels to grind there.
---
Gathering do give easy money. Look at what materials that is on demand on the trading post and gather them. There are many guides out there to get a goot route. You can gain a lot of gold just by doing this.
---
And then there are the Silver Waste map, the HoT maps, Istan and the last map that will give you a lot of loot in which you salvage and sell the materials. There is a huge pile of sience behind how to do it exactly right so look up a guide or two on youtube so you get the most out of it.
---
Then there is the trading post flipping but for that you need a bit of gold first and you need to have knowledge to flip the right things. But if you get that, a lot of gold can be gained if done right.
---
You could always get Diviner's from Bitterfrost
---
At some point a while back they quietly reset the ascended stat selectable gear from PvP season 8, and it took me like 2 weeks to realize that most of my gear had lost its stats.
---
ah yeah, you just need to have both expansions unlocked...
---
While the wall clinging is a little bit too agressive and could use tweaking in the form of an extra button to hold, just a little bit of thought and better control of your Skyscale alow it to land and stand on the same small ledges just fine.
---
There is no need for it. 
---
The jump from gw1 to 2 was because their engine  had fundamental limitations restricting the content they had in mind. 
---
This was addressed in gw2, they made the engine far more extensible and can add any future features they have in mind.
---
After reading through all the comments, thanks for all the responses! Will definitely arrange a night for this :) excited to dive back into this game...hope my friends like it too üòÇ
---
You can complete  [Goemm's Lab, Metrica Province](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Goemm%27s_Lab)  by using mounts.  Starting on top of the crafting station use your griffon then Bond of Faith toward the cliff and hug the cliff.  I'm happy to show anyone how to complete it.
---
Exactly. The skyscale is borderline breaking maps already.
---
With the rise of identity politics and peoples' genders/sexualities becoming okay to shove into peoples' faces whether they care about it or not, and with the rise of sentiment against straight/cisgender people... I sort of understand why there'd be backlash.
---
&gt;Also the life steal is subject to all of the heal multipliers that Renegade gets. This is part of why it's so brokenly good.
---
Lifesteal is subject to healing modifiers? TIL 
---
&gt;My group ran Renegade solo healing no-greens VG when PoF dropped (in other words, before the staff buffs; it would be vastly easier today). It worked out a lot better than Druid. A lot better. Nothing will do better than scourge for solo healing the greens, but Renegade is extremely good at it once you get the timing down. The timing is very tricky, but this is pretty thematic with Heal Renegade: the skill floor is very very high. If you do it wrong, you are completely unviably sucktastic. If you do it right, you're the most potent healer in the game and it isn't close
---
In my experience, Renegade struggles to outheal greens - the delay on the tablet is terrible because you need to know precisely when the green will explode, and use Natural harmony a second before that, on top of wanting to have staff 4 off cooldown and with energy to use it. 
---
&gt;And this is exactly what I mean by "if you do it wrong". Kalla is your primary healing legend. Ventari is for when shit has gone to ass. You still swap on CD for energy, but most of the time you really shouldn't be using any of the Ventari skills unless something has gone wrong or there's a particular mechanical need for it (such as out-healing greens, or projectile absorb, etc).
---
&gt;If you believe that Kalla has no healing, then it explains a lot about why you think the build is potato. You are simply, objectively and testably, wrong.
---
If you need a healer, I do not believe Kalla will be enough. It has not been enough in my experience so far - Soulcleave does not give enough lifesteal for people outside of their bursts, and Breakrazor's bastion isn't immediate enough much of the time - same as the tablet. 
---
&gt;As they‚Ä¶ wander around for no reason? I'll grant you that if you have a group which scatters to the four winds like they're playing under OG Social Awkwardness and it's an autokill, then yes, heal ren isn't going to work. Literally nothing is going to work at that point, except maybe heal tempest.
---
Artsaariiv splits. Arkk blooms. MAMA adds. Siax splits. VG splits. Gorseval splits (no damage here though). Deimos greens. CA sword/shield collecting.  If you can upkeep regen, people are significantly less likely to die during the splits. Before it got removed, I ran with the trait to make the orbs from staff give regen so I was always giving some sustain no matter which legend. 
---
&gt;The orbs, by themselves, can maintain around 4-5k HPS in my group's testing. Like literally, no other healing output, just staff autoing to generate orbs. For the record, that's more healing than a GotL Warhorn Druid can do in total (excluding Water Spirit, which pushes them up to more like 7k in a full squad). Rather than thinking of them as something you need to pick up, just think of them like a weird sort of healing aura. No they don't go everywhere. But yes they are perfectly excellent healing as long as people can stack‚Ä¶ which they need to do anyway for boons.
---
The orbs, individually, heal 10 times less than that at most. I do not know where these numbers come form, but I am confident a GoTL Druid's warhorn regen is stronger than the orbs.
---
&gt;You're going to have a Firebrand anyway if you run a Renegade. Renegade/Chrono compositions are really strange, particularly for fractals. It's just a question of who heals, and the Renegade has considerably stronger and more versatile healing while maintaining higher group DPS.
---
Yes, you will have a firebrand anyway. If the Ren is healing, it cannot boonstrip or provide stability, the latter of which is amazing for pug fractals. I also do truly believe the Firebrand has significantly more versatile heals, and does not need to choose between legends or utility - it always has its tomes, no matter what. (There are also Firebrand/Chrono groups, and ever since Druid lost its easy access to stability from nature spirit and GoE, I do believe a Radiance Firebrand (for perfect inscriptions and bane signet) is the superior healer for such groups as long as they take staff for might). 
---
&gt;Ironically, Matthias is one of Ren's easiest bosses to heal, since the spirits cover the whole central area (where you should pretty much always be except when you have bombs), and Tablet is one of the best "heal them while they run to the well" skills in the game. I've seen this boss healed with just a Ren and a Harrier Thief (mostly providing regen) in a very not-clean run where people were making tons of mistakes, and it was generally quite smooth.
---
"Regen isn't important" "mostly providing regen." Do you see the contradiction in your implied statement from earlier? You know you need regen. And Matthias isn't really the best for Renegade. Too much movement, again, and the tablet does not have enough range. There are a few bosses where Ren works quite well as a second healer, but I would never say it works best as a solo healer for the vast majority of groups. Especially on Matthias, where you have Mirages, who move a lot as part of their skills and thus will be out of the tablet's range very frequently. 
---
&gt;My group has been doing this since PoF. We've Renegade healed every fight (with multiple players, so it's not just one super-dude who has discovered the font of wisdom). Since the staff changes and the Draconic Echo rework, we're even running Renegade as the solo healer and most things (basically, for bosses where we don't feel like being particularly safe; we aren't a speedclear group). It works. It works insanely well. People, including the people you have been speaking to, are all playing it wrong.
---
Draconic echo is a herald skill. I agree with you that Herald is a strong - it provides regen, which makes its healing far safer and far more reliable, and shield 4 is no joke either. 
---
The only times I've seen Ren solo heal successfully are in the speedclear records groups like SC set and post to youtube and/or the gw2 speedrun page, which really don't need that much healing to begin with, i.e.e they're doing so much DPS that they don't need a truly dedicated healer.
---
No. All these precisely calculated restrictions and thought-out edge-case scenarios are there to ensure the *other 6 mounts*, each of which offers unique and fun ways to move, are not made obsolete.
---
Bloodstone Fen. All the unbound magic adds up fairly quick, as do the events.  The other LS3 maps are also better than the main maps.
---
Wait, so we don't have to farm Pearls for a Minstrel armor now??
---
This is amazing news for me. Im currently farming a new set, but a reset makes me save so much time! Yay
---
I don't get why ANet always has to murder ways to have fun. I didn't mind the time gate (even if I could do without it) but using the skyscale just feels off. The flight bar drains way too quickly, so you don't really get a "dragon" experience, more like a glorified glider. I felt that way while testing it in Dragonfall while doing the collection but I thought that once I got the mastery that allows the skyscale to climb walls at least I could fly, hop on a wall to rebuild the blue bar and then jump off to resume flying. And I honestly loved that idea, felt like a very engaging concept. Nope, not only it consumes stamina so doing that is limited, it builds the red bar on top. The skyscale being so limited is so sad cause I expected better from the griffon which also feels like a glorified glider to me.
---
It's been two weeks now since I returned from a two year absence, the reasons why I left the game to begin with which I had forgotten are creeping back in, ANet is literally obsessed with limiting things and killing fun and the toxic fanboys that enable those practices aren't helping either. Meh.
---
I'll bet you 50g it doesn't. They've already done updates that reset all gear prefixes on stat selectable equipment and nothing catastrophic happened. Worst cast scenario they forget to add something where it should be.
---
;o; Best joke I heard today!
---
I have a rarely used character with such gear. And it's already been twice that my stats were reset, and there was no UI indication to that.
---
They‚Äôve done this in the past before without destroying anything.
---
I mean its the new zone, a few collections tied to the same new zone should be expected.
---
So does that mean I can use my piles of mistborn motes on Viper's gear now? Sweet!
---
Nope. GW2 is basically printing money at this point. As long as it's heavily profitable, they won't make GW3.
---
Oh for sure! I'm working on twilight, im just slow lol!!
---
I'd definitely like another game in the franchise, but I think that hope died off thanks to NCSoft. I think Guild Wars 2 will be their focus for the next 4-5 years, but maybe its "replacement" will be announced by then. I think it would be as much of a change in gameplay as GW2 was for GW1.
---
Actually I think that kind of thing would be very useful for people. I have my skyscale and I will admit that I am struggling a bit to find out how best to use it.
---
This has been a fun little series while it lasted. Best of luck in whatever comes next :D
---
Quickbrand is the one that should be producing stability and can have the option to take reflects. You can take hallowed ground or use tome f3 for stab, and wall of reflection or f3 for reflects. These are one of the roles of firebrand, so it is your responsibility to learn and use them, not other party members. Atm qbrand is the one of the best sources of stab, and is flexible enough to bring reflects.
---
Don‚Äôt blame bad teammates until you understand your class throughly, and have no more options to save them. If you keep this in mind, you‚Äôll grow quickly, and get better and better at the game, pushing the limits of your class. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
---
Alacrigade will not help your situation, it is all about understanding your class and your role.
---
Also, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for specific roles. Don‚Äôt just lfg for daily t4‚Äôs, but also add the roles you need: dps, booms, or heals. If you have 3 dps already, lfg for booms or heals. Kick anyone who joins without following your request. Don‚Äôt be afraid of kicking people. It is YOUR responsibility to find a good group with a good composition, it‚Äôs just a matter of using your power to do so.
---
Nice to see the change but I find it strange they‚Äôre still keeping limitations on raid loot of all things instead of replacing them with stat selectable of any type gear.
---
&gt;could use tweaking in the form of an extra button to hold, just a little bit of thought and better control of your Skyscale
---
I like this lot. Griffon can dive and climb. Skyscale could dash and cling to walls.
---
&gt; With the next release,
---
[May 28th](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/)?
---
First day I was on a map where he was bugged over night. So the fail timer is way longer than 30 minutes (if one exists at all).
---
Holy shit. This is a big QoL change. Old LS3 maps are going to be extremely useful.
---
&gt; Exceptions include the following:
---
&gt; Elite specialization collection armor and weapon rewards
---
Oh... Does that mean I won‚Äôt have access to all stat combos on my Warpblade? :-|
---
Flame trap was tested as more dps than viper.
---
One wolf pack means every hit hits twice, so double the condis (I think, not an expert). If that‚Äôs the case, you can time it with bursts so you and your teammates get double the condis for a short time
---
I think the biggest problem for the skyscale is other mounts exist and gw2 doesn't want to take away from other mounts. It kind of makes sense, if the skyscale got faster it would easily trivialize both raptor and the skimmer. It would also hurt jackal a little but it'd still have portals. And a height increase would start to encroach upon springer's domain. So what can we do? I say give the skyscale a boost in horizontal speed. Forget the raptor, it's the first mount and the easiest to get. Why bother protecting that niche? Are we saying 0 effort and cost means it needs to be considered special? And as for the skimmer give the poor thing a speed boost for water. I can't think of a reason the skimmer shouldn't be as fast a rollerbeetle. Just give it a harder time maneuvering.
---
Simplified pros and cons of leveling normally.
---
Pros: Slow access to skills and traits to learn what playstyle you enjoy. Gradual reveal of things to do in the endgame (dungeons, fractals, raids, high level maps).
---
Cons: Slower than boosting. Pros are irrelevant to someone with a degree of patience/interest.
---
Bottom line: If you boost and just click through all the reward messages without reading them, you'll be lost and confused and really only have yourself to blame.
---
Sure, it will be released with Wing 8.
---
I doubt there will be a GW3 until there is a fundamental change in the way we play games. As long as it is keyboard and mouse based input systems there‚Äôs no point in developing a completely new game, the current system is already expandable. Similar to how there has not been a completely new WoW, just expansions.
---
Not gonna lie I have no clue what this means.
---
I think an easy fix would be adjusting the descend button. If it's latch on a surface the griffon would be able to land on press descend while latched to land it on the surface.
---
nah this is my main toon, been using this one for days in many meta
---
Around 60 for everything but branded mass which was 100~ or so.  Had a full stack of Kralk ore.  No home node for Diflourite or Inscribed Shards, which was probably the worst of the two imo.  So I didn't have to start from 0 fortunately.  
---
I did move all my gathering alts (5) to Jahai with the Sun's Refuge scroll.  So I could farm that one easy heart with them cause mistonium was what I needed the most of.
---
Its definitely tedious though and I totally understand most people not wanting to do the currency grind.  Its just something I can stand in games and felt I could do at my own pace somewhat.  So it wasn't high on my list.
---
I'm inclined to agree. I know it's pure fantasy but griffon at least has some thought put behind its flight capabilities, especially with some skins that give it a big tail like a bird. The Skyscale feels like it wouldn't be able to fly at all, the huge bulky tail would drag it down, and the wings aren't connected to it's body full length - there is no way it would stay aloft for more than 2 seconds. It looks like it's struggling and just paddling mid-air. 
---
Personal preference, but I like when animators and artists put some thought behind the fantasy animal in how it would move and use it's body plan to do so. It's why the roller beetle or raptor make a lot of sense, because they feel "realistic", in that regard. Like obviously you don't need 100% scientific accuracy but I can BUY that griffon is flight-capable and I simply don't get that with skyscale. 
---
Rule of cool, I suppose. But I wish the animations reflected it better. This is the second mount that recycles the griffon animations (Warclaw uses same ones too). I guess it's easier and cheaper, but I wish they'd stop doing that for any future mount editions. 
---
At least you can argue that there's some adjustments to the animations so it's not complete copy/paste and the sounds as well.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here not even done with the first episode of LW3, let alone any of PoF aside from the first mission or any of LW4 aside from the beetle itself.
---
tyty
---
I hear that, it really burnt my bagels.
---
Edge-case, and I'm probably misreading this so please correct me, but if I (for example) just bought a full set of healers trinkets because I wanted Nomad stats, does this mean that's now wasted currency and I should go buy a new set?
---
Honey, $400 will you get 1st place! 
---
Alternatively it will cost you a chak egg sac. &lt;3
---
Dang, you are good.
---
Cuff him bois, we got him.
---
Map completion, rifts.
---
f
---
When it works, tbh. It crashes on my setup immediately and we haven't been able to troubleshoot it. Besides, Vulkan has a slightly better potential if I remember correctly.
---
Not every ascended armor and weapon piece let you select every stat. It was mostly limited per item which came from a specific expansion. For example, ascended trinkets from LS S3 episodes do not have the PoF stats and S4 stats selectable (Grieving, Marshal's, Diviner's, Harrier), so if you wanted trinkets with those stats, you previously would have to farm S4 maps, or do the appropriate achievements that directly gave you trinkets with those stats.  
---
When this change goes live, the expectation is you will be able to select ALL stats you have access to per your expansion unlocks (if you own HoT only, you won't have access to PoF stats unless you buy PoF, and likewise). No more "if this trinket is from s3 then you can't choose PoF stats". There are still exceptions, but for the most part, ascended gear is being normalized across the board which is great for new people who might have gotten confused before.
---
Go for it! I'm interested to see what other people think of it's design.
---
Did you know that you can bind a key to mount a specific mount?
---
For example, I got:
---
Z = Bunny
---
Shift+Z = skimmer
---
Ctrl+Z = jackal
---
X = Raptor
---
Shift+X = griffon
---
Ctrl+X = roller beetle
---
It's a lot faster than the radial menu. Lets you swap mount in 1-2 seconds
---
The changes I would like to see... doubt they'll ever be implemented though...
---
- If you cling to a wall and still have flight juice left, you should be able to expend flight juice to scamper up the wall instead of awkwardly sticking to it.
---
- Increase vertical flight speed, make the flight canopy steeper so that flight juice drains faster when moving horizontally, but slower when moving vertically. This is clearly a vertical mount... you shouldn't be running out of flight juice before you can even get as high as a springer jump. The griffon eclipses the skyscale for horizontal movement.
---
Can someone please explain the joke?
---
Sweet, this means I don't have to have farm a stack of 250 diflourite and 325 mistborn motes after skyscale collection needs!
---
So what happens if i have bought  "Malicious" gear and selected  "Marshal‚Äôs"?
---
I'll get hit by the reset and can only choose other stats? I think this  will fuck some of my gear....
---
Could be or with the raid.
---
If you have the Sun's Refuge scroll from the achievement you can move any 80 alts to the map and do the easy hearts that require no combat (you can avoid combat on all of them really).  Most notably the one right beside the refuge that you can throw the branded shards at the target dummies.
---
If you have any gathering increase boosters they are worth using before you starting your gathering runs too.
---
WvW or PvP reward tracks.
---
If the jump between gw1 and gw2 was because of the engine, they wouldn't had developed a game that was drasticly different from the previous one.
---
its the cave of wonders!
---
&gt; It should've had infinite flight as it was first described as, albeit slow.
---
Your post adds nothing of value to the subreddit and has been downvoted accordingly. Infinite flight is absolutely absolutely, completely, and irredeemably bad idea for GW2.
---
I'm looking for suggestions on how to gear my character for WvW.   
---
I have a Warrior that I didn't touch from before HoT, and he only has Warrior core specs and one third of Berserker training done.   
---
I have around 300 gold but just 400 Hero badges.   
---
It seems that atm my priority should be the Warclaw reward track (currently at 9k points).   
---
For gear, I have full Exotic Knight gear and Berserker Weapons (GS, GH, WH, Sw).   
---
What's the best way to acquire Marauder equipment, both exo or ascended?  
---
Also, is it worth it to exchange proof of heroics for hero points?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúhuh‚Äù to. 
---
They state they are keeping the prefix limitations yet non raid selectable gear is being updated to remove limitations.
---
You can mystic forge it to change stats.
---
just make it an option for those who want/need that.  I love it how it is.
---
Hm.. Do Spinal Backpacks count as crafted (I figure they mainly mean the discipline backpacks)?
---
It was the only reason. They opted to change other things AFTER they made the decision. 
---
In fact the gw2 combat system is nothing at all like the one they pitched during development.
---
I mean, look at the weird gawkish neck and body proportions full sized kralk ended up having.
---
IT could anyway. Cause stat swapping in the forge.
---
We're free! We're finally free!
---
... Actually, skyscale (even warclaw) should not exist but one or two masteries/skill, just see how Bond of Faith and Bond of Vigor opens so much possibility already to current mounts. 
---
But to be fair, as a developer, there are more benefits of releasing new mount than enhancing old ones... skins, more contents, etc.
---
Quite a few items, most notably Ascended Backs, didn't have 'default' stats; you had to click on them, and choose a prefix (Berserker's, Viper's, Carrion) from a pull-down menu. Problem was, for the most part, you had to use a 'HoT' Back to get HoT stats (Viper's, etc.) or a 'PoF' Back to get PoF stats (Grieving, etc.). 
---
The new system will be account dependent, not source-of-item dependent. So, in the process of applying all the possible stats to selectable gear, they're setting them all to an 'unselected' state (since most can't be changed later (or not cheaply...). 
---
It's similar to when they took 'Magic Find' off the stats you could gear for (hoo, boy, did *that' stat cause... friction in Dungeons and such...); all your previously-Magic-Find gear became stat-selectable.
---
No, you will be able to re-select post-update. They aren't wasted.
---
Bitterfrost frontier is now the undisputed god amongst mere maps
---
Yall just hit the buttons until things happen.
---
It's what I've been doing for years as a dev and it usually works out.
---
I've just spent 300 pristine fractal relics for them o_o
---
Altoholic who equips all alts raid ready
---
Omg That's going to be me. I recently found one of my characters with a back piece with no stats selected... Not my main but still!
---
How about time spent doing what I want in the way I scheduled, rather than the game making the schedule for me?
---
Just happened to me 2 days ago. I tried clearing the cache, didn't help. So I put in a ticket. HOWEVER, just logging out overnight worked for me as when I logged in the next day it was fixed. I've read that a few people found logging out for 2+ hrs fixed it. So see if that helps!
---
You can also post here:  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/9645/report-stuck-in-queue/p1](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/9645/report-stuck-in-queue/p1) 
---
They have that set up since it's an ongoing issue.
---
Meanwhile I started 6 months ago and I have leggy raid armor, ad inf, Aurora, eternity..
---
1.) Have you already Mystic Forged for the correct stats you want? If yes, that sword won't be losing its current stats.
---
2.) If you haven't, why? In less than a day you can either farm the gold to buy the required inscription (they really are not that costly, like at all), or could farm the materials yourself (with some luck for the rarer ones). Then see point 1 when you stat change.
---
3.) The specialization weapons have never been categorized in the same way as things like LW map Ascended trinkets or raid armor boxes, why would they be now? They have always had a short list of selectable stats that didn't even range the entire gambit of stats available in base game iirc.
---
This QoL update is fantastic, I don't know why people are trying to pick at the most infinitesimally small "issues" to detract from it.
---
Few  weeks
---
Is it hard to get? Like the look so mich
---
right but nomad is being removed from healers trinkets and the guy said he bought healers trinkets.  And Anet said they are going to be stat reset....
---
Well said. 
---
The Skyscale does not replace either of them but does similar jobs to both and in some cases will be better, and in other cases worse.
---
And someone got to the top of the huge tree stump at the end of Dragon's Stand in 7 minutes using the Skyscale. It's pretty legit, they posted a video somewhere on the reddit here.
---
are you implying someone would read that :O
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
I mean, they're confirmed to be coming, so... yes?
---
What?
---
The question is, will your nomad's be reset to healers, or into defenders.  No idea, wait and see I'd say.
---
What's this?
---
He listed 4core specs
---
Done but still crashing.
---
My biggest frustration with the skyscales based on those found in the new map is that the dash's speed ends immediately after the dash itself.
---
I will be wildly more enthusiastic about the skyscale if there's at least *some* preservation of momentum from the dash. In the same way people have complained about skimmers losing all extra speed when going over a tiny island in a swamp, I think it's purely disheartening to use a dash and then immediately halt.
---
Even a slow deceleration over the course of a couple seconds would feel better than the dead stop it has now.
---
I could be completely wrong, but your marshal's gear shouldn't be reset.
---
When you select Marshal's from the Malicious chest, the gear become Marshal gear. This is a little different from say ls trinkets, which are still the same trinket (i.e. Black Ice Earring), but display with different stats.
---
the minmaxing with AR comes from the fact that the fractal potions give extra stats depending on your AR, so you can get extra precision and reach crit cap by stacking more than 150
---
Are you alright?
---
Too late!
---
This is really welcomed change:-)
---
+1
---
Don't forget about raid trinkets, currently you have to go to wiki to see what stats each trinket supports.
---
Also, will pieces of armor in my bank also reset ? or do I have to move them into a character inventory ?
---
&gt; Yeah I get that but I also am a bit miffed about how getting legendarys isnt prestigious and can be done by everyone except f2ps in mere seconds :(
---
It depends on the legendary. Legendary weapons can be outright traded for gold, for example, so it is true that someone with enough gold can just buy them.
---
However, achievement-based legendaries like this one, Aurora, and quite a few others are unable to be bought with gold. Their precursors are account-bound and only obtainable through achievements, and while crafting them does require a significant amount of gold, no amount of gold will magically make you be able to get them.
---
For example, Aurora takes a minimum of 16 days to complete if you're being as efficient as possible. I'm unsure about what's required for Ad Infinitum, but I think the Gift of Infinity requires doing a lot of fractal stuff.
---
It's already supposed to do that, but we have some holes to fill in it now, apparently!
---
It‚Äôs especially strange considering living world currency items will be getting better functionality than raid stuff.
---
Would be great to see them with the skins you chose.
---
It mostly just feels slower because it's bulkier than griffon.
---
lws trinkets didnt have any categories anyway. So you think all the used raid equip wont be reset? Its just the way i read the patchnotes, I could be wrong too.
---
&gt; To everyone who protects legal multi-boxing 
---
The silliness of this is that multiboxing is possible without third party tools like Launchbuddy to handle. You just need a few shitty PC's and you have the same effect. If multiboxing does anything it's level the playing field between those with a single computer, and those with multiples.
---
The second botting comes into play, yes there is a huge problem. But that has nothing to do with multiboxing. You can bot on one account instead of ten, and it would likely be easier to do.
---
There is no rational solution to this problem that isnt already in place: Don't allow bots.
---
I feel like one good thing they can add is an increase in speed the longer you fly. Think beetle vs raptor on the ground.
---
I smell a fix patch incoming
---
This is a good update.  It future proofs a lot of existing content.  Not thrilled I'll have to go check gear on 20-30 builds, but w/e its not like I update them every patch anyways.  Good incentive to check em over.
---
go ahead and play at your own pace. Most of the stuff in PoF can be done in a small group or solo, outside of a few things like bounties, which you should have generally a few more, 5-10 people on average, so I wouldn't worry too much about being left behind. 
---
That being said, PoF maps are never super populated, because they don't give a lot of reason to be super crowded all the time.

Considering most months include at least one member of the winning team using someone else's account, this is probably a reasonable estimate

I have no idea how, but I've seen the rev and necro PvP NPCs floating around in the pvp lobby before. I feel like the skyscale is breaking a lot of things...

Please let us stack the ascended chests from fractals/raids.

Few more mounts and we will end with LGBT flag:-P

I think they would rather pretend crafting doesn't exist.
---
Are you really blaming me for asking why weapons locked behind sometime exhausting grinds (HoT) are being left out from the possibility of selecting all stats and thus, resorting me to use the classic way?
---
The blog didn‚Äôt say ascended backpacks from PoF‚Äôs collection are an exception, yet elite spec weapons are. If anything it oppose what they‚Äôre aiming for, consistency.
---
&gt; 3.) The specialization weapons have never been categorized in the same way as things like LW map Ascended trinkets or raid armor boxes, why would they be now?
---
For the same reason LS3 trinkets are obtaining LS4 stats?
---
And why wouldn‚Äôt they be?
---
This seems like a great idea, should really help new players to get the kind of gear they want, plus it's better rewards for the rest of us if we don't have to stuff all the Gronk's toughness, precision and healing power gear down the mystic toilet before it's worth using.
---
Heal thief human female, heal thief human male
---
Just wanted to point out that regarding the wyvern treat, a group of us did the legendary Matriarch in VB and none of us got a treat out of it. I don't think she can drop it, or at least it's a low chance because at least 7 of us were there for that specifically.
---
It's not just gear - chrono in general had changed quite a bit.
---
Optimizing your gear is up to you, though commander does cost you a fair bit of damage. At a minimum I would suggest the swap to Pack runes, as FB runes do not work well with current chrono.
---
I'm happy to answer any specific questions you may have as to why builds are set up the way they are.
---
Alright, I'll swap out sword of justice for hallowed ground more often in fractals where we want to stack amidst waves of CC (like the Cove bosses) and Bane Signet for wall of reflect when even more defense is needed. Lose out on some damage but don't do damage when the party keeps going down
---
With the announcment to reset all stat select gear and make all attributes available after reset, switching to diviners and getting diviners trinkets should now be way easier.
---
I wish they'd do away with types of ascended boxes and just put make every ascended item access all stats your account can. Stat swapping isn't that hard, so why make us do it at all on a fresh drop? Just make every item choose whatever stats your account can.
---
What is the benefit of grieving over viper's if you have the option to choose either? I only use grieving because it's cheaper and easier to craft.
---
Who doesnt? Commander Cauliflower saved Tyria and its economy plenty of times.
---
&gt;	oddly No-Man‚Äôs-Sky at that too, Promised the sun, delivered a Lava lamp
---
Off-topic, but, when was the last time you played? I think a lot of people would agree that HG has now fulfilled their promise, and then some.
---
This is actually bad for future maps and their incentives. Obtaining specific stats is a big appeal of new living world maps and their rewards will never be able to compete with Winterberrys. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Winterberry nerf because of this.
---
Until this causes a nerf to Winterberry farm.
---
Its 6, ROYGBP. So take out griffon and jackal and you'll have the flag.
---
I hope so.
---
A few months back I went out of my way to complete *all* the HoT ascended backpack collection items. The 3 guilds + Auric. Much to my dismay, you could only get a very limited set of stats from them. It wasn't even all of core Tyria stats, but also a complete lack of HoT stats. I threw them on a bank character and figured "Well, at least I can make more berserker backs on demand I guess."
---
I am really excited at the chance that these suddenly become worth it. I also completed the LS3E6 mechanism collection so I have a bunch of those I can now play with for PoF stats.
---
More importantly, this might mean **LS3 MAPS CAN NOW BE USED TO GET PoF STATS ON ASCENDED RINGS, ACCESSORIES, BACKS, AND AQUA BREATHERS!** That was one of my biggest gripes with LS4 ‚Äî no reliable way to gear out on PoF stats which forced you into using Mist items or magnetite shard. LS4E6 kind of solved that problem aside from the lack of a repeatable PoF back item and aquabreather.
---
No but it helps cap might for the rest of the group. And the alternatives in that same line are crap for power warrior.
---
*More burning projectiles, yay /s*
---
My group runs firebrigade and we do fine with might. I have issues finding reason behind your poorly presented PSA.
---
yeah, it is something to squeeze every ounce dps as you possibly can if you want to. but you don't NEED it to run the build for regular or pug clears. you can also get by fine with your commander gear if you get enough boon duration from it so there is no rush to swap to diviners all at once, you will just deal slightly less damage while getting through the swap (but you should consider swapping to it eventually since the toughness on commander doesn't really do much for you and those stat points can be better used elsewhere)
---
This really seems like it‚Äôs in preparation of build templates. I expect we‚Äôll see a few more QoL changes to gear and stats down the line to get us ready.
---
As a straight man, it's hard for me to even get out of bed with all the discrimination leveled against me. Like that time I wanted to get the last sprinkle donut and a gay person took it instead. Or that time a character on TV was trans. Or like how I can't wear a rainbow shirt now because I'm afraid people will think I'm gay. No one has ever felt oppression like I have. 
---
And why do they have to keep shoving it in my face, by existing? I can't think of any examples where gay and trans people are ever exposed to straight people or culture. It's so unfair. Hey, who else here loves sniffing glue?
---
I thought something was fishy when I noticed Diviner's on LW3 Trinkets! Thaaaankkk yoooou Anet Love You!
---
The first shot has some guy's head and mouth ripped open by a spike with blood gushing out
---
Phalanx Strength Core Warrior is a legit good build for short team fights, but personally I‚Äôm in love with Berserker and there‚Äôs no way to fit the Tactics line without losing the damage buffs from Discipline. Sad times. :(
---
So, am I wrong, or is this *fucking huge*? Because there's a lot of pretty easily obtainable exotic gear with selectable stats, isn't there?
---
Even for people who already have fully geared builds, this is going to make trying something new so easy, and not all that painful if it doesn't work out.
---
Aw shit, here we go again. *Parks 8 alts at the Berry farm WP*
---
I'm sorry, lol, so many time visiting gw2 subreddit that I just confuse it!
---
You are right, sorry!
---
How dare you forget about our lord and saviour, the heal scrapper :(
---
Could be. Though I am not expecting a nerf until they start LS5 in an attempt to make new maps more rewarding.
---
Swapping runes is no problem of course, but changing the whole ascended gear, getting new trinkets and extracting infusions does cost quite a bit of time and gold. 
---
I feel like chrono damage is negligible in most cases anyways, so I'd just like to be able to bring the full utility when there can't be a chrono found on lfg.
---
Are the Pack runes better than Eagle runes (i can see they actually have boon duration in them) for "casual" players? 
---
How Much Boon Duration do i need, as a target?
---
You‚Äôre actually not the first person I‚Äôve seen make this mistake, surprisingly, which kind of goes to show how lack luster and irrelevant the siren mastery was to Siren‚Äôs landing as a map.
---
What announcement? And when will this reset be?
---
You are right, I'm sorry.
---
I think that highlights the best part of this game: You can play at your own pace! No subscription fee FTW.
---
Why should they let people break the game?  Aren't they well within their right to control where people can and can't go?  Especially if it somehow bypasses other restrictions or controls that are in place?
---
Use Glyph of Bounty if you weren't using it already.
---
Yes but it doesn't mean this will be. Next release could mean raids. Makes sense introduce it will the next content that gives you ascended stuff.
---
AIN'T NOTHIN GONNA BREAK'A MY STRIDE, AINNOBODDYGONNASLOOOW ME DOWN
---
OH NOO
---
I GOT TA KEEP ON MOVINNN!
---
(why do I keep replying with this to these posts? Pls save me!)
---
You're going to see a lot of different amounts of boon duration recommended. The bottom line is that it varies heavily with the skill of the chrono and the group. For less optimal groups, you still want a lot, I recommend 80-85% with food/util active.
---
Eagle runes are better lower bd setups, but Pack is excellent for more general setups. It's also not just the boon duration - the fury from the proc is very helpful in raids for the non druid sub and fractal comps without a druid, especially since warrior banners can't be used to start fury anymore. Its not always needed, but if you want one set for everything go with the Pack runes.
---
You can already get more than 5 harrier backpacks though. Backpacks from raids can choose it as a stat.
---
This is great.  I bought a few trinkets before that didn't have the stats I needed, it was really frustrating and wasteful.  I think I have two in my bank now that are still ready to select stats.
---
But if said breaking of the game allows people access to paid content without paying for said content, then I think Anet has a very obvious right to restrict that.
---
It's good on some professions in places like WvW where condi cleanses are abundant, and it's about getting damage out fast rather than having them stack up over time.
---
&gt; I can understand why those weapons/armours are exceptions - they have their attribute options curated to direct players towards the playstyles the specs are designed towards, so giving players total freedom would somewhat defeat the purpose.
---
That‚Äôs an explanation I can understand. üëçüèª
---
i didn't know i needed this UI fix until today and now can't see the normal arrangement without feeling dissatisfied =(
---
It's only 250 currency for that particular reward track then. Every other is 50.
---
And yes, you can do reward tracks "overnight", 6 hours or so.
---
I'm super excited too! I'm curious to see how Anet actually implements it what with spaghetti code and all. I'm sure this isn't an easy task for them at all so I definitely appreciate them going for it!
---
Wait, I get a reset for free? Awesome.
---
Skyscale niches:
---
* Higher and more precise ascension than Springer (Flies higher, doesn't need to charge before leaping, can wall jump to reposition if needed instead of falling all the way back down, just tapping a landing refills juice entirely, don't need to find solid footing to relaunch when climbing)
---
* More controlled and precise diagonal movement through space than the Griffon (Doesn't keep moving forward, has on-demand vertical movement)
---
* Better at crossing wide gaps than the Raptor and Griffon (2 mid-air long range dashes, can be extended to 4 with Bond of Vigor, more precise landing positioning. Doesn't have to worry about ground obstacles or terrain height like the Raptor. As long as you have dashes, it's faster and more general than the Griffon since you don't have to find room to dive for speed.)
---
* Can be used as a springboard for Skyscale -&gt; Griffon shenanigans for longer range Griffon travel.
---
Room for improvement:
---
* General air movement speed. That's about it. But even then, if you have your dashes up, its movement speed over medium distances horizontally is really good. And its ascension rate is already extremely close to Springer, if not better, to the point where I've unbound my hotkey for it.
---
Run metas in Dragonfall? Yes please.
---
Farm Bitterfrost? Yes please.
---
Receive entire trinket set? Yes please.
---
Yeah I see no downsides other than other maps are going to see an even steeper decline in playership.
---
How can you set up those buttons like WASD and M etc? I can't find options like this.
---
Originally it also featured a pink stripe, but that was removed with later versions.
---
Champions rest? Wtf is that?
---
In-game is the perfect place to ask people! :)  
---
(also you need to specify which server you're on, EU/NA)
---
Hey! I suffer from the same issue and have sent in a support ticket about it. I will just copy paste what their response to my ticket was below:
---
Hey Hoxworth
---
I understand that Almorra's Directive has not expired from your character. Typically, this will be removed once this achievement: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_of_Blood has been completed. It does appear that you have completed it... 
---
As such, I would like for you to try and remove all your character's armor and then teleport to a different location, place the armor back on and see if the buff is still there.
---
Alternatively, the following steps have helped some other players resolve similar issues. Can you please try the following and let us know if this fixes your issue also:
---
Completely close the game
---
Go to temp folder by going to start/run, type in %temp% and hit enter
---
Browse to the folder gw2cache-(guid). Example: ‚Äúgw2cache-(50641E0B-3AD4-1601-081E-6450D43A0116)‚Äù4.. Delete the whole gw2cache folder
---
Restart the game and see if this resolved your issue.
---
Please let us know if the buff still has not expired. 
---
Regards,

Let me know if it works for you
---
The skyscale was good for exploring and maneuvering around the map while looking for eggs and not getting attacked.
---
The gear will still be split into four categories, but if you've already selected the stats of a piece of gear it won't be reset to the selectable version, presumably to avoid cases precisely like this where someone buys a piece of gear for a stat set that it would no longer give them after the update.
---
Yep. Bitterfrost + Dragonfall will get you a complete set of all 6 trinkets. Bitterfrost has a backpiece, Dragonfall has an amulet, and they both have a ring and accessory that can be paired with the other one.
---
I expect these two maps will become "meta" for all trinket needs.
---
I used level 10 alts also
---
Oh no, we will all be in the poorhouse because we can't bathe in the financial nirvana expounded by renowned gw2 gold guru dank_galv.  I'd better go back to eating only peanut butter and potato sandwiches to conserve what meager resources I have.
---
Poverty, you vile beast!
---
werking as indonted
---
Yeah. Take raptor and griffon. Both can be used to cross a canyon, but the griffon will take longer to get to the other side without a lot of height for boosting, so getting there with griffon will take longer than just jumping with the raptor right on that moment.
---
Anyone can use a shovel to do the job of a hoe, but the hoe will do it better.

Did this image really need to be 3.7mb?
---
You'll be fine in tier 1, just give it a shot!
---
Oh shit. That's fucking awesome then. Glad they fixed it.
---
Group might. Add some diviner gear with strength runes and you can easily hit 100%
---
She grew without the influence of an elder dragon as did Vlast/Aurene, I'd say that counts as not being corrupted.
---
Glint required a complete magical ritual to be cleansed so it seems less likely being raised by someone "nice" does the same thing.
---
Im down to 5k now, given away a shit tonne of skins anet probably hate ne. Generally people are really happy, obvs a few addhats who dont even send a thanks but overall its fun doing this, whoever just got the Equinox sword skin you seemed really friendly!
---
Are you saying run the standard banner build on discretize? Or the might sharing variant? Afaik if you are pugging you have a healer so thats either a chrono/druid comp or a fb/ren comp and in both of those the might is taken care of by the supports, weird build not withstanding. PS is still the best option for warrior because you dont gain a whole lot from double combo finishers but there is a big difference between running PS and a might stacking PS.
---
I fear completely changing layout of a terrain for a group of players is far more complex than removing/adding one NPC.
---
I saw another player in fractals with a moon hovering around him. Does anyone know what item causes that?
---
Chrono DPS isn't so negligible anymore, pulling an extra 6k on some bosses in Diviner's can certainly help a lot. Additionally, Commander's provides toughness where Diviner's does not. If you don't plan on tanking then it'll be much easier on your tank, as they can then run their low toughness gear.
---
I'm very much an exception here. Generally speaking, raiding gives you tons of ascended drops over time if you stick with it - just not so many backpacks.
---
However, it will be nice to not have an impending functional limit on how many PoF backpacks can be reasonably acquired.
---
Ad Infinitum took me a long time to get around doing (two years) just because I couldn't get the people for it. Which is an odd thing for me to say considering I was able to get a set of legendary armor from raids before that.
---
# Challanging content
---
It took me two days to get all of the currencies on every map. Keep an eye out for nodes, compete hearts on all of your alts to buy the mistonium there, and complete rift events. You can easily do 100 in a day
---
Well trinkets have the same stat choices, but don't all have the prefixes in their name.
---
I hate trying to remember which ring is which when buying
---
Actually this is going to make the blood ruby gear just as good as fractal/pvp stuff, since it has selectable stats at any time. Oof time to start getting rubies, this is gonna nice!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if OP is running a fb/ren comp and is constantly missing 10 might and blaming the warrior. Having PS and being a might stacking PS warrior are 2 very different things.
---
I'd go with 
---
&gt; # Creating Consistency
---
It's great that we'd be able to re-select stats, and that the system will warn us.
---
And it's important to remind people of that.
---
But ANet mentioning they are aiming to have more consistency? We can't never have enough of that.
---
there will be mobile devices capable of playing gw2 for an entire day straight before gw3 comes out
---
The problem was that each collection had to be done in order, and kept rehashing the same or nearly the same spots. I felt frustrated by that.
---
Hopefully they'll add an icon similar to the 'armor broken' icon, or an effect that allies can see so they get reminded.
---
Oh, yes that's a great one
---
I think the major problem is that automatic wall sticking, sometimes drives me nuts :-)
---
But Viper's also has Precision. And if you are going power why would you use Grieving over Berserker's?
---
No, contrast and irregularity is useful in UIs. Plus the original acquisition order is more logical.
---
...that said, I'm not against more UI elements being more customizable. Not all default setting will be the best for *all* people even if they're best for *most*.
---
Which is probably why they didn't bring it back for Dragonfall, despite having the opportunity to use Dirge of Balthazar, Grenth and Melandru in the 3 zones. It just wasn't worth it. The temple teleports are the more practical nod to s03e06.
---
I'd really like a guarantee from ANet on this piece. My biggest concern is that my stat selectable equipment isn't reverted after it's been mystic forged. Example - Opened a Defenders Coat, and forged it into Vipers. 
---
I couldn't even begin to tell you how screwed all my gear sets would be and how much of a gold loss that would be.
---
Makes sense. I haven't experienced that yet because I haven't been back to the game for very long (played briefly around launch, then quit and came back earlier this year after leaving WoW for good). Currently only have two characters with ascended anything; one with trinkets and backpack, one with armor, weapons on both.
---
Could be as soon as the 28th
---
[That Shaman's Patch Countdown App](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/)
---
Super-categories is probably a good way to phrase it. It's basically a compromise between raid gear dropping with a specific combination (which would be *way* too grindy, assuming any combination could drop) and that gear just letting you pick whatever combination you wanted (which probably wouldn't be grindy *enough*). I would compare it to how things work in FFXIV (and Wow, presumably), where there are different versions of most armours for each sub-role rather than for each class.
---
I just hit my 5 year mark on my warrior a few weeks ago I decided to take the gold I've accumulated and start my 2nd and 3rd legendaries hopefully in the next week or so I can get the last two things I need for the shining blade and bolt.

So accurate it physically hurts.

Honestly gz though it looks dope ;)

And when you fly over any water sources, it splashes water.

---
Ah nice, will try whenever I need more gifts of exploration :D.
---
We do not know.
---
Many people assume it's currency for the next raid.
---
I'm guessing it's the S5 cross-map currency, and that it slipped into the live version by accident, but we can't see the name and description because they are tagged 'dev-only'.
---
I got the home node early; im sitting on a couple stacks of that stuff right now.
---
Heal necro, heal warrior, etc? :D
---
because those things are a normal part of PvP. PvPers don't care about getting banned because they don't lose anything that can't be quickly and easily gained back by making a new account and botting, afking, win trading, on-purpose DCing, etc.
---
No thanks. Please don't try to tell me what to take.
---
Bloodstone Trinkets wins again! &lt;3
---
Yeah, I did like 3 raid boss clears on my dps Renegade before realizing I didn't have trinkets on. 
---
Luckily it was a guild run because I was quite a deadweight.
---
Core war is all you should be running in fracts.  If you aren't running core war, then you should be running a dps class instead.  Spellbreaker/berserker is selfish and not as good as a dh, sb or weaver.
---
Yep. I went to all the effort of typing two short paragraphs with obvious jokes making fun of your absurd point.
---
...
---
... sorry, do you think that's some sort of criticism? "You typed more words than me! Burn!" Your comebacks are just as well reasoned as your bigotry.
---
It is indeed like that, just checked on the wiki. As to the reward track completion times seems to me that not everyone is willing to farm pvp that hard xD
---
Or, you know, just color spectrum.
---
Well, you keep angrily responding to people, so kinda seems like you do champ.
---
Are Grieving and Diviner stats going to be available in the ascended chests too? :O
---
Pfff fractals xD

I now know why the [Sand Swell screams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b0ihyx/the_sand_swell/).

Gonna be honest I never even thought about it enough to bother me and........it still doesn't bother me.
---
Also the No Man's Sky comparison really doesn't hold water.
---
It's possible that it was one of the representation buttons and OP just didn't get a good look at it, but Aurora is more likely.  Only other thing I can think of is the function gyro for Scrapper.
---
So being tired of hearing about the culture war every day, everywhere I go on the internet, makes me a bigot. Lovely to see that this is what we've descended to. I don't give a shit what people are, and I think everyone should be treated fairly, but because I'm tired of hearing about it every single day, I'm bigoted. Gigantic yikes.
---
Is there any way to hide the information that shows up on the corner of the screen?
---
From what I've read and experienced the rifts are bugged currently. Sometimes they don't reveal a path, sometimes there's no functional end, and they don't currently contribute to the Ruler of the Skies achievement.
---
I guess hold off on exploring them for now.
---
Rainbows make more sense with 6 strips, anyways, to evenly divide a color wheel since color it's a spectrum and any division we make will be arbitrary.

Kill everyone in your home town.
---
Just have an idea of what you're doing, and don't join groups that ask for killproof/exp and try to fake it.  Most of the people getting treated like shit are because they fake kp for high kp groups and are shit and then get flamed.  If you're going to waste someones time and lie, expect to get flamed.  If you just join a t1 group and work up, you'll be fine.
---
Things to consider longer term.  Look at discretize website.  It's for endgame, but it gives you an idea what is good, where boons and buffs come from, and what works best where.  Also, read/ask/wiki anything you're unsure of to get a better understanding.  Be able to multi class is huge for end game fracts and knowing your burst and how those classes work is big!  If you want any more info, just ask me!

It does matter, unfortunately. EU and NA servers can't play with each other.

All of the HoT maps are designed around gliding, but you can still eventually get almost everywhere without it (it's just the most effective way to get some places, less so after the addition of mounts).
---
That's besides the point, anyways - the post you originally replied to was imagining a map that the skyscale could really shine in, not one specifically designed for it and it alone.
---
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Tyria! My name is Gorrik! People call me the Skyscale Prof!
---
Oh boy all those birthday boosters fam
---
I don't really think this has a direct link to the build templates, since ascended equipment can generally have its stats selected only once, so any build template system will still need to work with different items.
---
I imagine it's just something they noticed while making the build template system and thought "why on earth is it all so complicated"?
---
most likely dragonfall. The meta is pure value atm especially on maps with keyfarm during the prephase.
---
I'm guessing he means Dragonfall

This is the very edge of the map, Harathi Hinterlands.

Thanks for the heads up, cause I sure as hell would miss that and spend  most of my adventures in PoF going WHY AM I DYING.
---
Help me brother!
---
Long live the king!
---
In addition to that, the overwhelming majority of people don't create support specs for their alts. Most people focus on more offensive builds which typically consist of Core or HoT stats - this bypasses the PoF backpack problem. The two PoF stats that are relevant in PvE are both support-focused (Harrier's and Marshal's), so most people don't run into this issue.
---
(There's technically Grieving too, but that's super niche.)

Is that griffon smoking a pipe down there??

It's fine by me as well. I want to play the game, not grind the stats I need to play the game.
---
I'll be here when you start missing events just as they finish.
---
Maybe I'm not made of pixels, but others do ride me for their amusement.
---
^^^^just ^^^^kidding ^^^^I'm ^^^^so ^^^^lonely
---
Hmm I see. All I've seen from the show is the cherry eating bit. Very bizarre
---
Well, the biggest problem for me is the skyscale keeps losing altitude, even after it's out of fuel and beyond than the height you started at, It should stop descending at a certain point (maybe a little bit lower than what you started at, for anti-exploit reasons, if that's a problem). If you manage your griffon dive and pull-up mechanics, you can maintain much more altitude, especially over a greater distance. I think the griffon should excel in 'air movement speed', but now if you need to reach something high (like a floating island or whatever) I CAN make it with the griffon, but not with the skyscale, although it feels like it should be the other way around..
---
Wait. People save him? But he's not helpful at all. Just ask Snaff.
---
Maybe he was just bad, Weaver doing 6k on cairn the other day.  Also, just jokes about your friend.
---
&gt;We can't never have enough of that.

Eh only 3 characters. Should get some nice dyes to play Fashion Wars 2 with though.
---
Jump!
---
Did...did you read the part where I specifically said "particularly shines?"  Apparently not.
---
The first time in lion‚Äòs arch will be weird. Ive come back after a long time and im pretty sure one of my favorite JP is gone
---
At the moment, ArcDPS Build Templates (admittedly soon to be futile) doesn't support the radial menu because the radial mount dev doesn't "trust" Arc build templates. Which is why I don't use the radial menu.
---
Its not so bad if you can figure out a route for the wood. Managed to farm just about 900 planks in an ~Hour but thats with Griffon + rewinder + lws3 and lws4 maps.
---
I also did one in Caledon Forest and had the same result. Followed the  trail to the end and then nothing happened.
---
Or a sign of covenant between God and Noah
---
You made it beautiful, which is a huge plus for UI. I hope Anet sees your direction and takes it!
---
I wouldn't worry about that because that is exactly what people do already XD. However if I read this properly it means Hot + PoF gear stat one anothers stats so this will help both LWS3 + 4 maps out in population climb. Some of the maps are more of a chore to get the trinkets than others in both LWS's so I think it should balance out nicely enough.
---
That is what my main looks like when my daughters get a hold of my account

Ya cause its a short simple guide not some long ass benchmark video you want that ask digital foundry or do it your self stop trying to force me to get it done when its not my job i dont do wvw or whatever i play the game the end of the convo move on you got a video to make or someone does.
---
This was always the case.
---
Diviners is a core prefix, but was unavailable in PvE until LS4.
---
As soon as we got access to it in PvE, it was available, as intended, from LS3 selectable menus.
---
Mobile is back baby. Cash grab for Anet
---
Ahh, yeah that makes more sense. :D
---
u look like the professor im failing subject from, idk how to feelw
---
OP in 5 minutes: 2 channels Shadow Abyss, 2 channels Permafrost.
---
There is an GvG Arena in the Edge of the Mists. And if this is full guilds normally go in the Obisdian Sanctum or in the middle of Edge of the Mists for organized GvGs. Sometimes though a guild does a GvG in Alpine Borderlands but when they do it is normally away from the Garrison on a an open field.
---
Are you just guessing on that?
---
&gt; I've heard nothing but bad things in terms of how people treat newbies...
---
I cant speak for everyone but when you put in the effort and make an attempt to communicate with your party (doesnt matter if they dont respond) you put yourself ahead of most of the player base and people respond better when they know that you are a newbie. Having been a newbie once myself and encountered many since, being upfront about that makes a world of difference. Same goes for communication, saying "hey im new/struggling with this boss do you have any advice/tips for me?" stuff like that does wonders with how people interact with you. Assholes exist and will be asshole regardless of what you do, you can safely ignore those people. Focus on you and what you can do.
---
More like a Spacetimegate, but yeah
---
That's true and I've never bought any with shards myself but surely you've had them drop for you? I myself have 2-3 spare in the bank.
---
Taimi, Rytlock and Canach are the only members of the Commander's posse that I care for. But that _might_ be because they get shit done on a regular basis.
---
Is there suggestions in SIrens landing That the Risen are somewhat gaining  a sense of self? Like they are not controlled by Zhaitan but arent mindless anymore either. SOmwhat being half what they where in life and half something new and even there where suggestions of Joko perhaps trying to Harvest or assimilate the Risen into his awakened with little success.
---
If I'm not missing something, won't this change make the Bloodstone Ruby Band, Pendant and Backpack much more desirable than any of the other LS3-4 and for most players because stat-resetting is very cheaply done through the  [Bloodstone Capacitor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Capacitor) ?
---
Its like a burned Forest, It grows back, slowly but it does. SO we may see  in a new map eventually some Crystallization , Branded area that is no longer purple and  with no electric effect, symbolizing the  chaos magic of Kralk is goine from it and only a crystal remains now
---
Its because she's a not-quite-adult Charr. You can replicate the appearance in the character creation menus.
---
SOME Unbound Risen  gained sentience of their own. Not becoming who they where alive but something inbetween. The lore and side quests of sirens landing points at it.
---
That's what I thought, too.
---
Thank you for the feedback. We recognize that people have a lot of different reactions to the material in our study, and, if you qualify, we invite you to take the survey and share your thoughts with us!
---
It is something like Mistlock but gettable not by gems, but by being good at pvp.
---
No, one currently doesn't exist. That's why he's suggesting one be made.
---
I have some awful luck with backpieces. I think I've only had 2 drop ever (one from Xera and one from Sab), and only one was able to stat select into Harrier's. I've been consistently clearing 1-4 each week for well over a year now. (I don't always get to 5/6, but they also don't have any extra chances for backpack drops.)
---
Mind you that there are only three total raid backpacks, each one only drops from a single boss, and even then you still have to get lucky with the stat type.
---
As there are a lot of wonderfull answers that alreadg tackle every aspect of traditional leveling, I will instead give an analogy which might put things into perspective if using MaxLvL Boost.
---
Would you like at birth to press a button and to skill straight to age of 50, with around 100$ in your pocket and some random clothes on you. W/o any ideea where are you, who is around you. W/o even knowing who your relatives are or how you are supposed to make money, cause guess what, You just skipped the most wonderful time of your life, when you collect memories and make bonds.
---
All that said and joke analogy aside, nobody forbids you to return to starter zones as a buffed up lvl80 player who joined the game 20min ago. As long as you have a friend to help you out, go for it. 
---
But of course, experiencing the vanilla game ia just a different story in it's own. Myself I am returning each week for Farm and each time that I can just to wonder around!
---
Queer is no longer strictly offensive though. Calling things LGBT^(+)\-related just gay (e.g. gay pride, gay culture) is erasure for the LBT+, and so recently there's been a push for replacing gay (in this sense, at least) with queer. 
---
Sure, if you go to someone and call them a queer, that's offensive. But referring the LGBT+ community as queer is pretty common and inoffensive.
---

Hi, Periproct!

I thought I'd stop by to offer you a robot hug, and to wish you a wonderful day!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
At this point it is only way to get affordable Ascended aqua-breather, tho. And it is like nerfing SW.
---
One huge reason the Warclaw is a separate mount is so it can be balanced for WvW without worrying about other game modes.
---
Probably a similar reason the Skyscale is separate.  Masteries like Bond of Faith/Vigor apply to all mounts and must be balanced with all 7/8 of them in mind.  Skins and content are probably larger factors, but there are design factors here as well.
---
Oh, an opinionated point! Guess everyone better shut up then, no sense questioning opinions.
---
I have no idea what you're trying to say here. That I would intentionally do something slow and inefficient because it takes finesse to accomplish? No, obviously not, if I need to bolt somewhere I'm not going to be painstakingly using a combination of two mounts to slowly and incrementally gain an infinite amount of altitude. There is no place in the game where that's going to be the fastest way to get to a piece of content, because the game is not designed for it to be a necessary (or even particularly good) method of transport. 
---
This is for fun, only. If you're trying to one-up me because it's going to be slow and methodical, you're drastically missing the point. If it were fast and obviously better than any other method, I would be against it, because people shouldn't have to be fiddly like that just to move around the map optimally.
---
yeah but does that apply to season 3 trinkets?
---
A bit of a side note but you just reminded me of this secret place I teleported into as a Mesmer 6 years ago with all these unused assets and cool temple/trap things.
---
I think it was in the Caudecus dungeon and back then I couldn‚Äôt find info of it online :0 is it old news now? Or can Mesmers even blink through walls anymore?
---
Why the heck are we upvoting this post, everybody downvote and maybe Anet won't see it.
---
griffon can do that too.
---
if you think it's not a slur, get all the bullies who shouted that word while they beat me up for being a lesbian in high school in a room together, tell them you're queer, and see what happens.
---
Every business misses customers, mmos and game companies are no different. Catering to a plethora of different interests obviously isnt easy but trying to break things also adds its own level of exploration to previously defined content.
---
I mean, come on- At least a hidden 0 ap achievement, that's just cruel.
---
LGBTQ+, the Q stands for "Queer" or "Questioning" depending on who you ask.
---
It's a "slur" we've reclaimed. It's an umbrella term, meant for inclusion of identities, and is imo a much better and inclusive term than saying everything related to LGBTQ+ communities is "gay."
---
yes, it is. some people think that just because they've personally "reclaimed" it that it's ok for them to apply it to others and remind them of the violence associated with the word.
---
That‚Äôs why I explicitly did say that it can be offensive, but context is important.
---
Stalking. People getting abused for doing what the OP is talking about, even if they might not have anything at all to do with it. There is a reason why there is a rule about not posting screenshots with visible names. 
---
&gt;Witch-hunting is trying to get someone punished for something illegal they have done without a proper proof. Currently only accepted proof is unedited video, but doesn't guarantee the post will be allowed. Moderators will asses the proof and can determine it inefficient.
---
&gt;If you do not have proper proof, remove the character and player name as well as the guild tag. If you do not follow these rules your post/comment will be removed until you have edited them to fit these rules. If the name is in the title, the post must be reposted without it.
---
&gt;in high school
---
And how old are you now? Yeah it was a derogatory term before, but you're acting like the world hasn't changed since then.
---
Some LGBTQ+ people are offended by it, and they're free to be. The word does have a nasty history, but so too does "gay."
---
So generally as long as you're not saying "you effing queer!" or something to that effect, it's perfectly fine. It all comes down to context first.
---
+1 to the wall cling problem. Perhaps they can make it a hotkey instead of automatic. 
---
Also I think the height limitations are fine. They were clearly intending to have to height limitations be overcome by your ability to wall cling and regen your green bar with energy, so that there's, ya know, skill involved. I like this.
---
I think increasing the mount speed would be a problem in that people would only use the skyscale over other mounts for most things.
---
\^this.
---
The best deals you can get rn without waiting for the anniversary sale are likely the DLgamer one. 
---
If you do buy them, don't use the max level boost until you've at least finished the core game once. Otherwise you will most likely find yourself very unprepared for end-game content, mechanics-wise. (And you get some nice rewards from leveling up, some of which can sell for quite a bit like the  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior\_Sigil\_of\_Nullification](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Nullification).)
---
That is because you gave them power over you. People calling you mames is only as powerful as you make it.
---
It was likely the assets that ended up getting used for the ls3 lake doric fight in his mansion
---
So like.... stripped nekkid, portalled around some. Still there.
---
Even popped into PvP lobby, thinking it was a different game node.  Still there.
---
Nuked my cache dir. Still there.
---
The Silverwastes are a good way for farming gold. There are always LFGs up for the silverwastes events. I'd recommend you buying at least Season 3 an 4 of the Living World in order to be up to date about whats happening. Season 2 would be good too, but not 100% needed.
---
That's... basically life everywhere. People don't get wealth by being nice, they get it by stepping on others.
---
Wait I thought the Q stood for queer
---
purplemiku has gone up there with before skyscale with the springer
---
Yeah Nas has it
---
Why? Rule of thumb, if a studio doesn't have an announced upcoming new title, assume *some* amount of development work is going into 1 or more unannounced titles. The teams may be small, but they'll certainly have something new that they are exploring. It is the rare exception that there isn't any new development going on.
---
Believe me I already have. I always downvote any post where the person's bragging about a bug involving mounts because it's annoying and lame seeing them get nerfed. 
---
The superjump nerf last year for rabbit *really* was painful.
---
In some circles people say it stands for questioning. In others it stands for queer. You're not wrong
---
I use the beetle and zoom around the map in a circuit until I see an event.
---
oh, sure, I should just magically make the physical pain and impairment I deal with everyday magically go away. I don't give them anything, and I'm not going to allow people fighting to keep what they took from me by force to think that they're not terrible people for doing so.
---
Yup, that's a neat one too.
---
Exactly. They showed us exactly what we were getting, and the fact that the quest was long doesn't somehow magically change what was advertised. It's a perfectly valid reason for someone to decide it's not worth it, but that doesn't somehow make it false advertising. ANet was perfectly clear about what the Skyscale was supposed to be.
---
not everyone who is L, G, B, or T. it doesn't stand for me.
---
Welcome back!
---
i'm sorry that you find the word offensive and upsetting to you. 
---
"queer" has been reclaimed by many lgbtq communities, social activists and academics for decades. the term is now being used by many people within these groups as a term of empowerment. 
---
i think that allowing the word hurt you, and others who might share this view, is giving oppressive power back to the aggressors, which is counterproductive to queer social movements that have occurred in the past and continue occurring in the present.
---
Weeb wars 2 .... It has begun
---
&gt;imagine using build templates and having to go through a long list of attributes
---
You mean, exactly like the legendary equipment stat selection already works?
---
Its really hard to explain. It took me a good 3 years to make Twilight, after that it was just so easy that I have Meteorlogicus, Rodgort, Incinerator, Bolt, Astralaria, The Dreamer, and Aurora. The first one felt like such a monumental accomplishment that was unimaginable through the journey and now its like... neat, I'll make X legendary next.
---
Also the legendary in question wasn't even available when OP started playing.
---
Yes.
---
Yes, use Skyscale
---
well, no but i never focused on it before, when i finally found a class that i wanted to 100% main, i started working on legendary stuff.
---
Bratty childish. Not youthful and / or naive childish.
---
They definitely seemed to have been aiming for the "cute and youthful child" concept overall.
---
Got any examples of what would actually be improved -- in terms of game experience -- by having unlimited flight?
---
Because I can't think of a single thing, unless you're just a lazy person who only wants to get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible (in which case you really shouldn't be playing an MMO in the first place).
---
well that's an MP I'll never get... thanks
---
sounds interesting, i'll take a look!
---
yeah i got legy armor but its a lot easier and doesn't count for legendary collector achievement, so it kinda doesn't count.
---
With 8 characters it is probably better to use industry
---
You can't ascend with a glider, nor can you cling to walls with it.
---
The Skyscale is exactly what it was designed to be. If you don't enjoy it, that's totally fair, but nobody's forcing you to obtain it or use it.
---
Will dungeon weapon/armor chests get more stats to select from?
---
Reason to buy PoF: MOUNTS!
---
Reason to buy HoT: LS3 ASCENDED!
---
My bad if I came across as callous but
---
&gt;why are you so insistent on still applying that word to me against my will?
---
That's not what I said and you shouldn't put words into other people's mouths.
---
All I meant was, since the world has changed since you've been in HS (again, sorry if I'm assuming things), why haven't you changed along with it? Yeah, it might seem like I'm one of those people who says, "just move on", but that's part of the healing process. You don't cling onto things just because it affected you in a negative way.
---
\&gt;When the first rare dye you get is a shade of pink
---
Technically the dash doesn't drain flight fuel, it either pushes you out within your "canopy" which in turn is what actually drains flight fuel, just like if you were to fly forward WITHOUT the dash, your flight meter also lowers.  Also, if you want it to land instead of latch... stop holding forward.
---
Is it even fixable?
---
Yea, you'd kick that concrete off all over the place.
---
What helmet skin is that?
---
I absolutely think the descending speed when you're holding the button for it should be increased.  It takes ages to descend.  I wouldn't mind the ascending speed be increased a little.  Otherwise I'm reasonably happy.
---
Every single word used for identifying as LGBT+ has been a slur. Queer is an umbrella term, and historically was reclaimed long ago during the first gay pride movements ("we're here, we're queer" slogans, etc)
---
If you personally are uncomfortable being called queer, that's perfectly fine. But saying no one is allowed to use it and that it's universally offensive is incorrect.
---
I heard  really good burn for things like this, or if someone is lame and you need a word for them.
---
Time vampire
---
Climb something that would provide a really attractive Ariel view. As opposed to just seeing clouds.
---
Hi, I qualify and I actually prefer the word queer to describe myself. There are many facets of my identity, sometimes fluctuating, and it's far easier and more comfortable to use an umbrella term like "queer" instead of a long string of terms and qualifiers.
---
T4 craptals
---
hahah.. well this is what armor was around back then, all Orr stuff that you'd get from the karma vendors. Still one of the only non-kilt heavy pants, which is sad.
---
No, it definitely doesn't defeat the purpose. All Elite Specialization weapons had very limited atribute choice, with only 3 each. The change isn't meant to affect this type of item.
---
these \*honk\* gvgers ruining \*honk\* my gamemode \*honk\* build the \*honk\* wall 
---
they're not \*honk\* sending their \*honk\* best
---
And talk like that in chat is why I very seldom ever read it. If they are in borderlands or eb then expect to have some individuals not abiding by some random groups rules. It is a mass pvp area. Shoot those cannons and arrow carts, I do. If you are not friendly then expect I am going to do something to get xp and loot.
---
This is a great suggestion that would add alot of incentive and help newly joined players or people trying to get collections done as maps flood with people looking for perks. 
---
What kinda perks for ls map metas though?
---
My scale baby is unfortunately a lil' time vampire.
---
i'm not trying to deny that you experience these feelings associated with the word. i do think it's pertinent to highlight that these are your own unique, individual experiences, which are important and valid. 
---
however, that does not prohibit others from using the word even if they are not using it with violent and oppressive intentions. 
---
additionally, when using the word in academia to refer to a specific demographic, the "queer" or "queers" should be referring to those who self-identify as queer or it is being used as an adjective (i'm not going to get into the definition right now lol). its usage, in the context of the post and survey, shouldn't be imposing an identity on people because it assumes that they people participating already accept the premise that queer is not being used as a pejorative. 
---
if you do not identify the word, you have the agency to hide the post and move on.
---
Fractals, raids and map metas mostly. The rewards from those provide a very solid income just by doing content "normally" without much grinding/farming/whatever you wanna call it.
---
straight guys 2 cents.
---
i often walk by people RP in their own way, sometimes I'll say hi but as a guy who plays a girl avatar im most likely "hit on" it's never bothered me and 99% I'll try my best to play the part and act girly or play into whatever fantasy I've accidentally walked into . 
---
and if anybody is  hesitant about trying RP my advice is just do it. and my advice to people who activity RP advertising in game more couldn't hurt.
---
 (PS role playing doesn't have to be sexy just fun)
---
One full gathering path with TacO, only doing hearts as you run across them naturally, is enough to get you 50ish easily. If you take the time to do all the hearts, and do rifts when they appear, you'll get even more.
---
So you could just do that for a few days, very chill-like. Or you could do what a lot of others are doing and park multiple alts at the easy heart (where you throw the branded shards). Hit some rifts with those, too, for more.
---
If you have enough alts and time, you could grind out all 250 in a day or two... but honestly, don't do that to yourself. There's zero reason to grind yourself into hating the zone -- the Skyscale isn't going to fly away and never come back if you take several days or weeks or even months to get your currency.
---
YES, MAKE US AN ARENA ALREADY, SO THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO TOLERATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
---
Neat. I didn't know about that spot.
---
This totally didn't answered his question.
---
Ascended is not locked to single character and you can select/change stats on them too, don't?
---
He asked IF legendary wings can change stat more than once.
---
Answer is: yes, legendary allows us to always change stats, when out of combat, for free, while ascended must be reforged, if it's a weapon or armor, or can be reset in other ways in some cases. And sometimes cannot.
---
Well all maps get a little foggy after a certain distance, to hide Level of Details.
---
But yeah, I'm working on finding other cool places.
---
The utility. The Skyscale is a mount arguably inferior to the griffon with movement abilities that the other three mounts already give you, and you still have to buy skins for it if you want extra fashion wars.
---
Legendaries are weapons that let you pick whatever stats you want on the fly, have unique auras and cosmethic effects, and ascended stats.
---
Remember you can get 5 of each currency per day from pact command, it's not great but it's something.
---
So that's 45 in a week for doing almost nothing.
---
Assuming these are the people who dont care and dont want to grind the currency out.
---
It's bad but not THAT bad as far as collections go.
---
Hell I grinded out Aurora, that thing makes this one seem like a baby walk, not to mention you need currency and hearts and shit from draconis mons or whatever it's called.
---
And the time gated druid stones as well.
---
But from the perspective of someone who hasn't done Aurora I can definately see the frustration in this.
---
This sounds fun. Is the guild recruiting?
---
applying your own identity to the entire community is speaking for the entire community. not speaking for the entire community is all I'm asking you to do.
---
Actually I haven't seen any ball actually dropped. There was one, that almost felt down, pulled by speedrunners wanting their mount instantly, but they picked it up and removed some daily gates to keep those 5 players from generating too much noise with their alt accounts army on reddit.
---
Ah yes, charizard, water charizard, and grass charizard
---
Do you have a social guild?  If not, that is probably the best way to have fun in any MMO.
---
You could look to any portions of the game you might've ignored and try them out.  Many players are afraid of PvP and/or WvW but really enjoy them once diving in.  Same could go for RPing or JPs, trying different classes/builds, etc.
---
Also, don't be afraid to take breaks.  Focus on another game, or another hobby, for a bit and GW2 will feel fresh when you come back.
---
No offense but you aren‚Äôt playing GvG. 
---
You are playing an organized ‚Äúscrimmage‚Äù at best and you are doing it in PVE spec gear (lol) and in a public space.
---
That‚Äôs like 2 gangs meeting in the city park to fight and being mad the cops or other by standards jumped in...
---
Look we get it your a gang.. you don‚Äôt own the park/wvw maps bro, sorry.
---
So if you guys want to have private bloods vs crips gang wars go to a private server and play 5v or wait for time in the arenas.
---
Stop trying to recreate something that doesn‚Äôt exist anymore... I remember real GvG in its prime and this game has absolutely nothing close to it. (And the devs want nothing with it)... 
---
Case Closed. The days of old and the build wars is dead and calling something GvG doesn‚Äôt resurrect it.. it‚Äôs basically a slap in the face for what real ladder GvG actually was.
---
Just call it scrimmages and be done with it.. zero rewards.. zero titles..  (pve gear and shit balance)
---
Yeah man GvG was never here for gw2
---
Well, in the beginning there was only void jumping and bundle abuse. Making it outside bounds took time and skill. Like, literal profession skills.
---
Then gliders came to Salma. Before that, seeing someone inside Salma was surprising. From this point forward Salma became the starting place for people searching ways to get out of the map.
---
Now we have mounts. Springer and Griffon claimed every part of any map and made any place trivial to get in. They patched every hole in the ground leading to the underground sea and placed a lot of invisible walls. But those have a height limit and our griffon does not. I guess Skyscale makes it even easier? The point I'm trying to make is that there is no point. All players enjoy getting out of bounds at least for a moment, but not everyone has the knowledge about it. Mounts allow those players to have the opportunity and 7 years have passed already. I think is their time to enjoy as well.
---
Gw2taco man
---
I think I‚Äôve used this type of thinking so far. The only thing I can think of to go after may be legendary gear.... but it seems too much out of reach
---
ME TOO!
---
I don‚Äôt. I think that‚Äôs the problem. I‚Äôve never managed to find a good guild for me in GW2, where I can make friends and have fun together. All the guilds I‚Äôve joined were shit!
---
I didn't know KC could drop Xera's backpack.
---
And yes, you should probably curb your expectations. I'm over 1k lifetime LI, which I'm thinking is a *pretty high* percentile of raiding consistency. In my experience, most people either haven't been raiding for very long or stopped raiding after a while due to a lack of content. Very few people seem to keep at it weekly for over a year outside maybe the top percentage elitist guilds.
---
Might want to make a long term and a short term goal then.
---
i.e. Long Term: Get Legendary, short term: Complete all LS achievements for War Eternal
---
Daily achievements are basically free +2.  Draconis Mons has a few more flax nodes than VB I think, so good parking spot there.  If you've got an extra character slot maybe do a key run every week.
---
I used Tekkit's TACO marker guide to farm chests and caches. And meta whenever it was up.
---
Then don‚Äôt respond to the survey. But also don‚Äôt demand people center everything around your individual biases. Queer is a widely accepted and empowering word used by people under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, which you certainly know. You are choosing to make this whole thing about you personally, and it‚Äôs not doing you any favors.
---
Why, because of the stat-reset gimmick?
---
In the time it takes you to get a Blood Ruby trinket that you can reset, I can just get multiple trinkets from Bitterfrost. I then have all of those stats permanently and can swap between them at no cost.
---
If that's your thing then go for it, but it's a hard pass from me.
---
I'm sorry, but calling people "assholes" is absolutely an attack, and you've done it twice now.
---
I'm sorry that the term symbolizes violence to you, but to many of us -- who have also been victimized, you aren't special or alone in that regard -- it symbolizes a deliberate reclaimation of power. It's fair to say that others don't speak for you or how you identify yourself or what that word means to you, but you seem entirely unable to extend the same courtesy to others when they say that this word means something different to them.
---
Clearly this is a triggering subject for you, and that's valid. I urge you -- for your own health -- to step back from the conversation. You're the only person in this entire conversation who's attacking people by resorting to name-calling and personal jabs -- everyone else has been more than fair and generous to you while debating their personal views on the subject. Step back, calm down, then come back and share your point of view with a clearer head. If it's something that upsets you too much to do that, then you probably just need to remove yourself from the conversation entirely -- for your own sake.
---
Comparing the lists of adds/drops to the current stats, I think there's a slight error in the article. Precision-main gear will also go in Assaulter's, along with any two of the three (power/precision/ferocity) being secondary stats. Otherwise, precision-main gear that *didn't* have both ferocity and power as secondary stats (Rampager's, for example) wouldn't have a home.
---
This checks out, as Rampager's gear is currently in Assaulter's gear and isn't on the list of removals.
---
Does it take alot of gold getting the skyscale, or is it mostly playtime doing achivements? I feel like it could be fun to try and get, but i am really low on gold and have alot of stuff that needs gold, which is why i never got the griffon. Also, where do i get started?
---
You can't, that's the corner of the map and the green is the last spot the game allows you to move forward. The map borders are surrounded by something that's not exactly an invisible wall, but works like an invisible wall. Like, the camera is not colliding with the wall but it's still there to block your movement. And is not like hitting a wall but a weird vortex, where you get stuck while moving forward or while jumping.
---
It's not as huge as you might expect, at least for exotic armor. A *lot* of stat-selectable exotics (LS reward armor, gear from reward tracks) was already fully selectable.
---
Still very nice, though, especially for obtaining expansion-stat trinkets.
---
First Purity of Purpose, now Creating Consistency. Nice
---
Sorry, I play Berserker.
---
If it's anything like current templates, you just make your build as desired (selecting stats in legendary gear as usual), then you save the build and reload at any time. 
---
&gt; while not make the casual user overwhelmed by the otherwise long list.
---
I doubt this is a problem for users considering the effort required to make legendaries greatly outweighs the effort to select the stats for the template once at creation.
---
My personal rules around this are very simple. if they do it around a keep/tower so that they aggro the keep (or the tower) so that i and others have to constantly run and check to make sure we do not loose a keep/tower because we thought oh it is just them doing GvG, which mean i spend a lot of time i do not like to spend on running, then i will make my point clear. I usually ask the guild on my border, something like could you please move to GvG spot instead and then explain why. More often then not they do move. 
---
If it is two enemy servers fighting, i will ask them as well to move to another spot and explain why. If they do not listen at all i make a point with the cannon and will then for sure get a wtf message and i explain my point again and they more often then not then say, fair enough and move away. 
---
Thing is i see zero reason to why i should destroy their fights. They are keeping the enemy busy, they do something together in WvW as a guild and they have fun. Why do i have the right to say you can not, you must accept that i want to be a part of this as well?
---
Imo if you comunicate and act respectful you will get respect back.If you demand to be a part of their guild acitivy then yeah you will get told off. And with rights.
---
I mean in the real life if you see people having super fun in the park playing football together, do you go there and demand to be a part of that as well and start bombing them with waterballoons and get mad if they say you should respect them, because hey it is your park too?
---
the "designated" gvg spot is the open field directly on the north of hero's lodge bridge, at least for european servers, which is nowhere close to any objective, let alone the garrison.
---
On top of that it is a given that if you are fighting near an objective, especially a garrison or a keep, siege is going to shoot at you.
---
As somebody that tends to favour guilds over random pugs, you still were in the right. It makes no sense to have a scheduled gvg close to a big objective.
---
[Birthday Boosters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Booster) give much more than xp.  I use them mostly for pvp and wvw tracks at this point.
---
Fuck. Well, I'm just gonna commit now, no ~~turning back~~ editing.
---
Metabattle has guide on gearing up as well as builds for all kinds of content.
---
&gt; Do i really need to go around and record clips as hard evidence how the Skyscale trumps Springer and Griffon in those areas it was designed for?
---
I would enjoy seeing this comparison.
---
Only for PoF and LS4 maps though.
---
ELECTRO PINK
---
It's because we both know that ANet was talking about ascended trinkets and other vendor items that have selectable atributes, and YOU are trying to extrapolate it for the elite specialization weapons
---
Are you doing the old flex in queensdale?
---
Volatile was from balth actually
---
It's all exotic and has a Superior Rune of Infiltration on each piece. Just the name of it sounds garbage to me.
---
Finish season 4 episode 4 at least up to the point when you get Sun's refuge, and you'll want to have a character with access to each map because you need 250 of each map currency from season 4
---
Raids on builds I've never tried. I still main boon chrono but I love trying DPS chrono, healscourge, Heal+alac Ren, and Hand Kite chrono.
---
Yes. You have to go to every other LS4 map, and optionally some LS3 maps make it easier to complete. If you don't want to do the story, you can Teleport to Friend to get into a map for the first time just to hit the collection task, but you'll also need a full stack of the map material from each LS4 for the final purchase.
---
&gt; we both know that ANet was talking about ascended trinkets and other vendor items that have selectable atributes
---
Is it? Because these changes affect raid/fractal ascended items and backpacks you can earn through collections in HoT and PoF. 
---
&gt; and YOU are trying to extrapolate it for the elite specialization weapons
---
Oh fuck this, I won't apologize for asking why items locked behind tedious collections are being left out from this amazing QoL system meant to unify attribute-selectable equipments.
---
Why is it over :(.
---
Well, looking forward whatever is next!
---
Ferguson's crossing represent!!
---
How long did it take to get your account
---
that aint the skybox, that is the killzone before the skybox
---
ooh, right. Hope you held on to some liquid assets at the very least, the Karka sigils, for instance, are worth a fortune. If you have them in an item, make sure you don't salvage it, cause it'll turn in to Lucent Motes.
---
Check mate, round earthers
---
Does this mean my raid gear will or will not reset? The writing was a little confusing for me; was the exception about the reset or the way the attribute options change?
---
I frequently only buy gear for my characters from raids and there are some stat combos I‚Äôd like to use now that they‚Äôre being added to the various prefixes. Just trying to balance my expectations about this change and how much it‚Äôll affect me!
---
Yeah, the good news is, you won't have to *completely* regear to catch up on story stuff.
---
The bad news is, your build is probably broken or nerfed six ways to sunday in both stats and specializations.
---
or if they do, that people figure out another way to do it. This is awesome!
---
Can someone breakdown what this means?
---
where does one get the Warclaw?
---
Im not trying to recreate that old games GvG(only played like 5), i just want to play current games GvG, that was somehow created by community and has been the cornerstone of organized WvW, even outside of GvG. It is still surprisingly popular and for the first time ever, we got a reward for GvG EU turney.
---
So please, go FUCK yourself, there is GvG in GW2.
---
&gt; This is Mistlock, it takes 5s to get there.
---
I know, I have the scroll too. It doesn't change the 2nd point -&gt; be able to buy stuff while keeping your crafting window opened. 
---
&gt; drop it 2ft further away and we can all be happy.
---
That would mean that I *can't* keep my crafting window opened while buying stuff. 
---
But on the other hand, by *not* dropping it 2tf away, *you* only have click at the crafting station to use it like always. 
---
So in the end it's a tiny bit more effort for you or a tiny bit more effort for me. And tbh, in the end we are all egoists.
---
But don't get me wrong, I don't want to "protect" this whole issue. Even if I drop them myself there, it also bothers me if somebody else drop his merchant there and I have to click on the station (plus the fact that I can't place my merchant there... ironically). 
---
I just want to explain the reasons why people are doing this and that it has nothing to do with trolling.
---
i dont mind if it makes some mounts obsolete, thats preferable. springer is what, doing a heart and paying few g and you get it. for the skyscale i went through grinding and timegating nightmare, i want it to be superior lol
---
It's 24 hours of play time on the character you use it on. It doesn't count down while offline or while playing other characters.
---
I hope Anet can't figure out how to patch it and it's left in the game
---
Birthday booster is excellent for farming WvW levels, if you want them.
---
Yeah, but the Skyscale can gain more vertical height while doing it.
---
The Skyscale is also great for doing a lot of random node farming. I was doing Ember Bay earlier and that map is a pain to get around because it's covered in lava, rocks and cliffs which neither the raptor of bunny can handle all of. High perches for a griffon are pretty spread out and once you unmount to grab a node it's not always easy to get to a new one. The mount&gt;dash&gt;dash on Skyscale covers a lot of ground really fast and can get you from node to node really quick.
---
After using it a bit I'm not really sure you could make it better without just obsoleting every other mount.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Hmmmm, I have more than 60 Ascended fractal boxes in my bank. It's nice that this change will be retroactive. Makes them a lot more useful than they were.
---
I think the rifts could have been done better... Rn as it stands it doesn't feel like youre free, youre following a path the dev made for you. Why not make it so they spawn randomly around the world and when you pick one up you can shoot volatile magic in a line and make a road for yourself?
---
Story was garbage until HoT fight me
---
The first comment I posted here noted that you can get here with a Springer.  This was just teasing at what they said in the Live Show.
---
Yeah, roofing hasn't been that keen of an idea in the old maps apparently.
---
Unity is fairly easy to make prototypes with. Depending on how strict their engine is, testing might be faster on unity
---
If you get all mounts, the rainbow will be complete, with a pot full of gold in the other side.
---
*Your wasted gold.*
---
Superior mount staying classy as fuck.
---
Considering that world bosses take 3 hours to respawn i would not call 1.5hours bugged
---
I thought mesmer was a 'mage' type character and a ranger was the 'hunter' type character?
---
Well gg I've been deleting some of my exotics :/
---
is this an achievement? which one is it?
---
Introducing new stat Super Memetrals. Can only be made with the freshest water pearls
---
Can any of you help recommend some settings for the config file? I would like to make the game use as much RAM as possible, since i have **plenty** to spare. The GPU only has 4gb, so not that great. Running at 2k and medium high settings right now.
---
I was looking at the **uploads, vstreams,** and **surface** limits - i wasn't too familiar on the valid values such as: " String formatted as: "WXXXX" in hex"
---
specs:
---
EVGA GTX 970 sc
---
16gb DDR4 
---
i5 6500
---
500gb ssd
---
Much appreciated!
---
Great work btw, seriously
---
Yeah ngl you'll probably feel some pain.
---
I can't think about a lot of animals/beasts, which can fly and cling to a wall. The only things i can think about are insects and bats. I don't want either of those.
---
How does the Samarog Raid battle, Inevitable Betrayal work?
---
The smaller dot has to be inside the other player?
---
Or can he just stay near the edge of the circle?
---
http://dulfy.net/2017/02/11/gw2-samarog-raid-boss-guide/
---
Awesome :D
---
A bat would be awesome though. They just have to make one for halloween.
---
It is bugged. I was in a group where it spawned and the second it died someone opened the chest and it spawned again. The chest isn‚Äôt working.
---
Crazy idea but ... I recall seeing another chest in that area but only one spawns the anomaly, same one required for the banner collection. Are you sure you are at the right chest?
---
The smaller green circles on the two players have to intersect.
---

---
My is will It mess up the selection of stats on the trinkets. I know I have one that I used for a harrier amulet. Harrier is being moved to Assaulter's.
---
I'm hoping that if it resets I'll be able to reapply Harriers and not be locked to the new 'Healer's' stats.
---
You‚Äôd think, but with the elite specs, they change alot. They both have dps specs too, like all classes in the game, but if you wanna get in to high end raids, a mesmer (chronomancer) will be the main tank and a ranger (druid) will be the main healer. Those have been in meta for years and will probably continue to be so until the next expansion.
---
I'm at the most north-east corner of Vabbi, near skyscale tracks.
---
We really need LWS1 back in the game somehow.
---
Read the full question mate.
---
BRING BACK THE MARIONETTE!
---
I mostly jump into some events and open bags or roam around in WvW while crying over our lack of commanders. I used to pvp a ton and run dungeons/fractals but after stopping for a couple of years, I still feel like I am warming back up to the game. 
---
I look forward to the day where I can stop playing Solowars2 and find another friendly guild or somehow find a way to convince my gf that MMOs are ‚Äòfun‚Äô (she LOVES Left4Dead2 and murdering zombies but I can‚Äôt make the early grind stuff in this game look less like a chore, it seems) xD
---
Also, I love treating this game like Dark Souls and perfecting my builds/understanding of a class
---
I see what you mean but next week is a 'release' week. Their Tuesday schedule is release week - &gt; gem store week, repeat. I took that to mean the changes would come next week but your interpretation makes sense too.
---
Just stopping in to say thanks to the OP for the work posting all this.  I got my Skyscale today and the guides were extremely helpful.
---
How about detachable capes? Edda, you call yourself a master costume designer?
---
My video didnt need any editing just obs and done took as much time as the video is long another video with what you say would require timing and than more timing and if you knew at all how gw2 works you would know world boss are all timing so ya much more effort so drop the trolling and move on and for the last time my channel is not about benchmarking of any kind so drop it
---
\o/
---
For Dhuum greens, when do you guys leave the boss to go for your green? I'm finding it hard to get in a group as a green person since I don't have the classes pugs want to green so curious.
---
Is 5 secs enough on average to get to the green or do you need much more time?
---
It's hard to come up with a creature that can fly, cling to walls, and breathe fire. An insect-type could be cool, but I would also rather see something else.
---
kids these days
---
from the github :
---
The most common use case would be combining ArcDPS, GW2Hook and this. For this instance, I heavily recommend setting things up as follows:
---
    ArcDPS is named d3d9.dll.
---
    GW2Radial is named d3d9_chainload.dll.
---
    GW2Hook is named ReShade64.dll.
---
Ah thx! the big circle always distracted me, I see how it works now
---
Thank you for answering!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Aurene or a dragon type skin be the first one out
---
Because I'm trans and this is a game sub and I'm  concerned that trans folk were the butt of the joke
---
Anet - please make those chests stackable
---
Trans gamers are the only good gamers tbh
---
That's so cool! Your cgaracter looks like the queen of the Storm Troopers.
---
Not sure I understand, how does story making you feel like garbage emotionally = no emotional investment. It sounds like you're invested enough to feel badly over past episodes, which would be the very definition of emotional involvement.
---
Wasn't the reason it was remove because it did ***too*** much damage for Condi builds and Anet wanted to remove it because of reliance on it to apply a high damage bleed.
---
well, pegasus would be one of those according to BoTW and Skyrim ;)
---
A reason why I stopped playing. The content explaining backstory was behind a paywall. Felt to disjointed for me to enjoy it. I bought the game and it's two expansions and I STILL have to pay for the whole story. I'll pass.
---
like I said in another post, just look at Skyrim and BoTW ;)
---
oh boy thats memory lane, i remember that sewer JP. i loved it so much!
---
I suggest Bladed Leggings.
---
They have stylish skulls and chains and are one of the bulkiest light armor leggings.
---
Also try Warbeast leggings.
---
Feels like another update in preparation for build templates
---
I'll pay 4k for Aurene skin.
---
And she must also speak to me.
---
Fortunately, Dragonfall is very profitable and very fun.
---
A ground target for its dismount ability... the amount of times I've misjudged where it'll breath fire in one day is stupidly high...
---
Personally I'd prefer a similar engagement skill to that you see aurene doing in the domain map against the scarabs, the cone of fire from right to left. (Mainly see it near the corsair heart) 
---
In terms of buffing it, I'd feel better if just taking off didn't take 20% of your flight juice. I agree that it is a little slow (especially after using the dash and it momentum instantly dissipates) but with its agilness whilst in the air does provide a nice niche in the current mounts. 
---
Also I feel the flight juice should start from where you mount, but some consideration should be made so that theres a cool down mechanic for maintain that height? So you can't keep using the leap skill and then remounting to keep gaining height.
---
How seriously do you take fractal scale 76?
---
Armageddon Helm.  You can purchase it with karma from vendors in Orr that show up at a temple when you purify it.
---
Better than nothing
---
Thanks!
---
But, we went to elementary school together.
---
Finally, I can experiment with a grieving holosmith without tearing my hair out
---
Huh. I have all my mounts hotkeyed, so I had completely forgotten this exists...
---
Don't delete any of these old characters OP. Just a remainder.
---
...Dennis??
