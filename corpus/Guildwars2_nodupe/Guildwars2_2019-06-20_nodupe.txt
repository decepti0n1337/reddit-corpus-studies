I think the only non-unique ascended items are weapons. Pretty sure all ascended rings and accessories are unique. 
---

---
Back pieces, amulets and armor might be, but it's not like uniqueness matters for those slots.
---
---
---
Nah it makes me sweat......... yeah I meant paltry.....
---
Go to the option and set your hotkeys I have Shift+1-7 for my mounts.
---
not every one has linked his account to efficiency, raids are far from dead content and people are even doing raids now  more than ever
---
&gt;Is there a trick to it other than manually clicking that tiny little arrow and choosing a mount there?
---
Other people mentioned setting keybinds(my favorite) and gw2radial. But also anything with that arrow, like utility skills, you can right click the full size icon rather than left clicking the tiny arrow.
---
That's the funny part, because how couldn't you.
---
Well this method is pretty op for afk Farming. Just draw your weapon and ur Good to go. Spamming 4 is sadly still possible and should be banned imo.
---
Yessss, I love this song!
---
Yeah I'd agree with your thoughts, I definitely don't fully grasp what is too strong in PvP, especially when it comes to CC.
---
Cantha :((
---
&gt; Is there a trick to it other than manually clicking that tiny little arrow and choosing a mount there?
---
Hotkeys are nice for mounts but you can also right click the mount icon instead of hitting the tiny arrow. The same works for changing your utility skills.
---
The only place we didn't really get to re-see would be the Marga Coast. Maybe a little bit more info about Dzalana or actually getting to explore the Realm of Torment would have been cool. I would have also liked if that unused portal in Fields of Ruin had been used somehow. It also would have been nice to get any more information about what the hell Razah was.  Also, anything about Arachnia or the Joko vs Thorn conflict would have been sweet. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I actually really had to wrack my brain for anything to mention! I think Anet did a really thorough job with PoF+LWS4 content. The mounts, especially, are awesome! Honestly, my biggest complaint concerning lore would have to be the inexplicable gender swap of the Giant Fallen Warrior Statue.
---
&gt; Also, the Charr were present during the Foefire event that caused both humans and Charr to go ghost and die.
---
But wasn't the ghost form tied to the curse Adelbern inflicted upon his deserting soldiers and affected therefore only humans? As far as I know, there are no ghostly Charr in Ascalon at all.
---
You can just do low level content on your lv 80 rev. It's one of the classes with somewhat poor core spec performance, but works great with elite specs.
---
I choose alts based on content so my alts are only there for certain raid bosses where my main class doesnt shine. Everywhere else I play my main. Other people probably have different strategy.
---
Of course, and I have no strong opinion either way on reskins. I was just pointing out that people can want more "boring simple skins" without wanting reskins.
---
completion rate as in kills / pulls?
---
Percentage of accounts that have a successful kill.
---
&gt; ~~2 weeks~~ 9 months later we got raid.
---
i think using a bar graph instead of a line would have shown the data better.
---
Nerf everything else down instead. There is already too much powercreep in the game.
---
I stopped raiding a few months before w5, qT stopped even before that. I wouldnt be surprised if people simply got bored of raids or didnt want to bother doing them after getting legy armor.
---
You asked for an example .\_.
---
You know I actually have been wondering if dragon bash will be like festival of 4 winds before dry top release. If you remember it wasn’t a true festival as in todays since and at the end of it it led into the new season 2. Since it’s a permanent festival now that’s not the case. However I don’t think they’ve said dragons bash will be a festival which is likely since we won’t be killing a dragon every year...so I’m thinking the end of this dragons bash may transition somewhat into season 5 much like the end of festival of the 4 winds years ago ended in the zephyrite ship crashing in drytop
---
Should probably compare them in terms of time.
---
oh fuck my bad, thought this was part of a different conversation lol
---
Oh yeah, you right
---
Christ dude
---
Really like that, give us an idea of the most regular raids player base with w7 after a week even if w7 is not really hard^^
---
Sad to see how w5-6 repel that much, maybe that's because most of pugs ask for specific kp for these wings.
---
Does it include accounts that never tried an encounter?
---
An elite spec that lets you slot minions into the f3-4 slots. Minions can no longer be equipped in utility slots. F1/2 become simple commands like attack and return on ranger f skills.  New utility skill type 'commands' for more impressive control options (a rushdown effect/ boosted attackspeed to minions etc)
---
Includes all accounts on http://gw2efficiency.com Tried or not doesnt matter. Only counts actual kills (or bought encounters)
---
Not really. This is just the percentage of accounts on gw2 efficiency that’ve gotten at least one kill of the raid boss. There are probably lots of older accounts on there that skew the results, and folks who’ve only raided once that count just as much as those who do weekly clears. This doesn’t factor in total attempts or anything actually meaningful about current activity. And there are tons of folks, including raiders, who don’t use gw2efficiency. Do we honestly believe more players have done VG compared to escort?
---
isnt a legionnaire sword also a charr thing? if its old ascalonian shouldnt it be human design not charr? I could be wrong here but when I read "old ascalonian" and see the ghostly effect I think humans not charr.
---
While I don't raid myself, raids need to be a thing even if just for the minority of players. 
---
There is a great talk about Path of Exile on YouTube where they talk about this and the reasons for making content that only caters to a tiny proportion of players. I can't find it right now though.
---
This happens when there are two marker packs that share the same point. Are you using the external pack from Reactif?
---
&gt; But all seem to want do everything fast and easy and I can understand that. That’s why this game is cool as it’s possible for everyone to enjoy.
---
I never said I want things to be easy nor did anyone else, but the fact that you typed this seems to show that you acknowledge that it is in fact *not* a good weapon. You just like it, which is perfectly fine! You can use what makes you happy and provides the most fun.
---
What I was trying to tell you in my first reply to you is that it's incredibly weak damage-wise and doesn't offer any meaningful control to justify taking it but if you aren't concerned with trying anything else to try to see if anything else is more effective, then it doesn't really matter in the end. I just have the facts over feelings mentality.
---
Thanks for making this! I've been obsessively looking at a bunch of GW2efficiency statistics recently. Apparently there are 5 players in the game that are members of 6 guilds! o.O
---
I dont have alot of great idea for minions in this game just want them to be more active and less fire and forget. Plus the ability to desummon/kill them on command... and a return to me/guard/passive command kinda like rangers. Maybe add in a modifyer where if the player isnt using enough skills or moving enough in a certain time frame (resets with combat maybe) the minions deal less dmg and/or take more dmg ie something to combat afk minion farming, but thats another topic.
---
I'd smash aurene uwu
---
Yes, I actually am. I also tried re-downloading GW2TacO and starting fresh. If this is not happening to me only, this is possibly caused in recent versions of both packs. Everything worked like a charm in the past.
---
Yea I think the external pack is the problem. Try using the All-in-one and dropping Tekkit's pack into the folder as per the instructions on his site. I think this solved the same issue for me.
---
Ah you mean compared to other weapons,
---
I usually run GS with scepter focus, or sword focus if I don’t need range. They are great. 
---
Longbow usually I do it in open world doing dailies, LWS dailies.
---
It’s all go and fun.
---
Split cooldown between both I guess.
---
Also this was rather annoying, thank you for making this post!

---
Hey guys,
---
Just picked up the game with a buddy of mine and I decided to make a Thief. Currently on one weapon set I'm running a sword and a dagger and on another I'm running 2 pistols. I tried doing a little bit of research through Google as to what a good PvE build for a thief entails, but a lot of what I'm finding is over a year old and I'd like some more current/viable input from people who are experienced and playing the game now, so here we are.
---
Anyone wanna help a newbie out? I'd like to start familiarizing myself with what will viable late game in terms of dungeons and raids.
---
The problem with any class that uses pets is that reliance on AI for damage or CC is bad for game balance and either makes things cheesy or crap.
---
The solution would be to have auto attack damage on them very small but give them more command abilities or be basically boon bots.
---
holy that's expensive to make.
---
Yeah it's trash-tier for sure. I gave up begging for buffs and I just use scepter full-time as my ranged option.
---
More or less except for the fact that guardians do not tank in GW2.
---
[Probably this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_5S55jUzk&amp;t=13s) 
---
I swear, i like everything about PoE, only thing that keeps me from playing it, is the point-click and move, i hate it.
---
??????????????????????????????? that's expensive to you?
---
Not true, the echo of Turai Ossa actually wields a proper model Eternal blade in the [Arcana Obscura)(https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcana_Obscura) story.
---
&gt;But the problem with that is casual players will complain until the new zone is nerfed, like the HoT maps :/ 
---
The solution should be very simple: Don't do it.
---
10 gold is literally doing 5 dailies.
---
You get a total of 20 mystic coins just for logging in per month. Just selling those nets you around 25 gold.
---
Nice images, I liked them. 
---
I killed this as tank and kinda had to learn it on the fly. My group had me threading those Force Lines between pillars and spawn locations, but instead of putting all towards North as you mentioned (and stressing your pylon-player), I dropped them more evenly around the ring so each pylon player ended up dealing with one at times during the fight.
---
There are a few confusing aspects though. As tank I was getting spammed with small orange circles that pretty much did nothing. What's the deal with these? 
---
Also, I would occasionally get a set of three orange circles = small orange&gt;medium orange&gt;large orange, which I basically ignored completely. In your video, I think this is the one you mention taking out, but as tank it didn't seem wise to do so. How should a tank handle this?
---
Yeah that's it, thanks.
---
Not to mention that you can also get globs of ectoplasm from salvaging exotics and rares (i think). Although if you wanna salvage am exotic, I'd make sure its one you dont need
---
It's been almost 4 years? since the first wing was released, now, i am no expert but if the content is not growing at an acceptable pace and the people playing said content is not growing at an acceptable pace either, maybe it's time to cut said content and focus on what's making the company money. 
---
I am purely talking about raids, not difficult content, you can include that anywhere. Give the people who enjoy a challenge, a challenge within content that is already accepted and enjoyed by the majority of players and focus on growing that content instead, if branching out doesn't work.
---
I probably repeated some of your points, sorry.
---
haha.  Yes I removed your name bc I figured I should try to protect privacy of ppl.  But yes, Turant was the tag for this meta
---
Its actually quite simply why Raids arent that popular in GW2. Anet does a terrible job in improving a players skill and understanding of his class. Reaching level 80 requires nothing but pressing one and dodging randomly. Dungeons are not vital part of your path during that process and teamplay is nowhere to be found.
---
Now you want to Raid and have to actually sit down and read your skills for the first time, learn to dodge  when you need to and pay attention to your surroundings.
---
Then there are the bosses themselves. None of them actually push seasoned players. You bearly ever need half of a classes potential to pass a boss. It doesnt take days of trial and error, different starts and positionings and nearly perfect execution to kill a boss. Just a week or two for even a rather casual group to kill all the new bosses and start on the cms, which are mostly also not very hard.
---
So on one side we have players that dont know how to start raiding and think its basically impossible to get into and on the other side bosses that are no challenge for statics who raid once or twice a week for two hours. Take that plus the rather spare releases of those Wings and you got a perfect combination of to hard to get into to easy to stay involved. If there wasn't my really nice raidgroup we would have long split up and play something else instead.
---
Lol I have same curse but with Dragon's Stand meta. Not too bad but like 1/5 times, my internet randomly d/c's and starts up again and always during the running circles bit. Maybe try different time of day if possible?
---
At first, this seems like a rational point of view, but having been in business, I can say with certainty it doesn't always work that way.   
---
I was in the electronics business in NYC and the company I worked for had a story on 45th street back in the day. It lost money. But everyone had a store on 45th street who was into electronics and they ALL lost money. That is to say it was a more competitive street and they couldn't really turn a profit, but having a store there meant you were more serious to electronic buyers. Having a store there meant you were in the game.
---
Too many in this genre think raiding is the de facto end game and any game without raids isn't worth even looking at. I know raiders who came here thinking to raid and stopped when they saw there were other enjoyable things to do that weren't quite so stressful or demanding. The game changed them. It doesn't happen to everyone but you have to get those people through the door (as we said in retail) before you could sell them.
---
  
---
I'm not saying this is the case, but it's certainly a possible scenario.
---
There's nothing to be done about it, there's a shit solution and ArenaNet doesn't care at all beyond that. Their UI is a complete mess (they said so themselves) and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have anyone left that was involved in it's creation and we all know how ArenaNet hate polishing "old" parts of their game.
---
Help me to decide if should play ele or chrono?
---
Links don't contribute to host population. Many times on NA there have been VH links with Medium hosts. It's probably just bandwagon players logging in to blob people down.
---
For leveling don't worry about builds. Unlock utilities called Signet, pick the ones that makes you run 25% faster and increase Power.      
---
For meta builds check the website Metabattle
---
same problem very annoying
---
There's currently two of these: 
---
World Boss Portal Device - covers world bosses in core tyria only. 
---
Maguuma Pact Operation Portal Device - covers HoT + SW/DryTop. 
---
I've heard people swear by them, but honestly, I don't see the value in them. Opening up necessary waypoints for these things doesn't take long at all. It does have the advantage of teleporting you to a contested waypoint if it's contested at the time, but it's a mild conveniece feature as there's usually another WP like 20 seconds away. So eh. If you really really don't like traveling and have gems to burn, sure, go nuts. But there's probably better things you can do with your gems.
---
I mean is it? As it stands now, they attack anything that hits you, and attack anything you try to attack. A simple macro that spams 1 will have them chase anything you auto attack.
---
Minions are also super weak. If you replaced all utilities to just AFK farm and went for full minions, in a lvl 80 zone they would do maybe 1k DPS. They die super easy, so when one dies, you lose more DPS.
---
There are better classes for AFK farming.
---
They skill-split Herald's Chaotic Release from 45 seconds in all modes to 20 seconds in PvE. They can do the exact same with DH's Longbow 5 (massively lower the cooldown in PvE, keep the same cooldown in PvP/WvW).
---
If this is from the introduction of raids, I would guess it shows more the gradual loss of interest because of the long wait between each wing up to 6. I say this because wing 7 is too new to draw any conclusion about it right now.
---
Also got busier myself + ArenaNet and other companies have added to do more in games (sort of) despite longer times between releases.
---
I'm in the top 1000 AP players but I haven't cleared any of the bosses after Dhuum :(
---
It doesn't seem to work with the royal ascalonian sword (dungeon weapon)
---
Its your monitor
---
Check the [wiki page on it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_secrets). You need to be by Miller *by the mystic forge* and donate to the event that resets every 5 minutes. The community just unlocked the second weapon so you'll need to wait for the next collection to start (should be tomorrow if they are going weekly now).
---
thats only 5 days of dailys
---
9 Months between new Raids is not a nice rate, but also not an unusual one. FF, SWToR and ESO have an equally big hole in between. But none of them release Raids that are so easily done that you are done with them after a couple of hours.
---
It took my group three days two hours each to kill the new wing and do the first cm. Better groups were doing the whole thing in cm in half the time.
---
That's what makes those downtimes that long. If you actually would take a couple of month for a decent group to kill the hardest difficulty the waiting time wouldn't be that horrendous.
---
wow... I can't believe they gave you a week for that. 
---
Personally I would have given you 6 months :)
---
Plus it’s a friggin game.   Yeah, games can be frustrating, and it’s ok to get mad.  But people need to keep themselves in check.  It’s ok to express general frustration, but to direct it at someone that stepped up to take a leadership role is out of line.  That person is probably already concerned about not disappointing everyone, and that is just worst case scenario.
---
yea it's a big deal
---
its a racist slur, in any context its not appropriate to call others that no matter how cranky you are about a video game
---
*Facepalms and shakes head*
---
Frivolous use of the N-word in pop culture and on the internet does not give you an excuse to use it yourself. There is precisely ***ONE*** context where that word is not racist, and your context is not it.
---
Anyone know where Guild Wars 2 stores the keybindings you use for a game?, wanna port/copy,paste my Guild wars 2 settings/keybindings from my main account to my side account
---
Pof really isn't much harder than core. OP should just take invigorating precision and become immortal
---
I thought the whole idea of roleplaying was pretending to be a character inside the game so why does it matter if they’re lgbtq or not?
---
If you can, logging in daily gets you a daily reward. There's a few drops, especially the mystic coins, that are pretty valuable, and the rewards you get are on a predictable 28-day schedule.
---
You can get a bit more of an advantage by doing daily quests. Completing 3 of the 12 daily assignments will get you 2G, as well as some free achievement points towards your next achievement reward.
---
These are, of course, totally optional. But they can definitely help a less-hardcore player earn a few extra gold pretty easily!
---
U don’t have to comment on every comment I have to others. You already have your own comment chain dude. I didn’t use it as a racial slur directed at the relevant audience.
---
how would you know that?
---
Clown isn't profanity. It's not racist. It really is black and white in most cases.
---
Good dude, you deserved it. Don't use that word, ever, learn and avoid the problem in the future.
---
Well I’ll be using “clowns” passive aggressively in pvp next time then. And no pun intended on your part?
---
First   the Queen's Jubliee/ Four winds and now the Dragon bash..  looks like all the events are here!
---
Yeah I doubt I will anymore. And it should be censored in the game too if it’s deemed a useless and inappropriate word in every situation.
---
Thanks for the response. I might still redo my rev cause I want to do the levelling process. I have a feeling I may still stick with my main 90% of the time.
---
I don’t. It’s the intention which is the point
---
[removed]
---
Yep, no pun intended. lol
---
You deserve your ban. Probably should’ve been banned for longer using a slur like that in chat. It’s not a benign word.
---
And they should censor it if it’s never going to be used productively.
---
just the first Tutorial instance
---
I believe the starting area waypoints are unlocked for everyone from the start so you should be able to meet up quite easily.
---
you can do stuff together immediately.  One of you would need to go to the others starting area, which is via a portal in their home city.  That portal will take you to Lion's Arch central portal hub, which you then take a second portal to the others home city.  Then you just go around doing stuff together.
---
Personal Story Missions unlock every 10 levels now, which you'd have to go back and forth to do each others, but i think they converge around level 30 or so.
---
I cant upvote this video enough
---
That's not their job. It's your job not to say it. Even if it were to get censored, you deserve a ban just for typing it into the chat box, even if nobody sees it. That's how taboo it is.
---
Damn dude, you really just can't take personally responsibility here can you?
---
I'm normally not okay with censorship of any kind, but this shit makes the entire gaming community look bad. You let people get away with it, and then edgy little fucks start spamming the word whenever they can.
---
There's games with voice chat that I couldn't play in public or with people around me without disabling voice chat because of how bad this issue has become. This one word I'm perfectly fine with every developer taking the "scorched Earth" approach with, because it's gone too far.
---
Take the L. Learn from it. And stop fucking pretending you didn't know it was a bad word with any context.
---
I’m not saying I’m not in the wrong. But is there any point in leaving it uncensored in the chat?
---
That PvP image does look like the Hall of Heroes.
---
I just want to be able to use them in parties/fractals/dungeons
---
A lot of old timers like myself are waiting for the alliances. Hoping, waiting and maybe one day !!!!
---
My suggestion is find a steady wvw guild. And your buying time and friends to play with. If that's not working, you could go for a EU server.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Mksic.gif](spaghett) code
---
Can I get HoT or PoF mastery experience by leveling crafting in those respective areas?
---
As a fellow Kaineng player—there was a big jump to a linked server a few months ago which basically killed the alliance discord and caused a loss of a bunch of guilds
---
Buddy - the censor doesn't censor it for everyone. Almost everyone disables the censor. Beyond that - the censor is not for 'ban-able' words. Words used for hate-speech such as these ones, are beyond the censor. You just never say them in public. Hate speech is ban-able, just read the ToS. Swearing is mostly not actionable from the ToS.
---
So -- please stop asking them to censor it, it's nothing to do with hate-speech.
---
Basically, in that they're a primarily melee class that focuses on both melee attacking and magical effects, and can bring some healing and protection to the table (but isn't the best at either).
---
fbm with my 24k magnetite shards
---
Some people say it’s the taboo word, and then you say otherwise. People don’t really know what they’re talking about I guess.
---
In the general game options is a profanity filter with three settings, "none," "normal," and "maximum." In this case, "none" is a true "none" that other people choose in order to experience raw unfiltered human anonymity... and/or to ERP, I guess. Anyone who leaves it on "normal" or "maximum" would have the n-word censored.
---
In other words, only the people who switched off the profanity filter would have seen it in chat. But remember, even though those players made a choice to be potentially exposed to harsh language, it doesn't mean that ArenaNet thinks harsh language is acceptable.
---
I know less about holo, what you describe is close to the kitless holo build. For raids would recommend force+impact sigils over blood+accuracy, and scholar runes (not sure what runes you have tho).
---
For most raids you will be stacked with group and some of the buffs/boons provided by supports (and food+utility) will help you reach crit cap. 
---
For reference in most raids your group should be able to maintain quickness, alacrity, regen, swiftness, fury, 25 stacks of might, and vigor. There will also almost always be a warrior bringing Banner of Strength (+100 power, +100 condi dmg) and Banner of Discipline (+100 Precision, +100 Ferocity) and usually least one druid (depends on the group comp, sometimes there may not be a druid). If you are in a subgroup with a druid they will also be providing you with the buff Spotter (another +100 precision). The expensive food to run is Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup and the utility can be Tin of Fruitcake or Superior Sharpening Stone. Cheaper alternatives to the food can be stuff like Plate or Truffle Steak or Can/Plate of Steak and Asparagus
---
Your utilities would be:
---
Healing Turret (or AED)
---
Photon Wall
---
Rifle Turret
---
Laser Disk
---
Prime Light Beam
---
I believe the traits for kitless are:
---
Tools 1-3-1
---
Firearms 3-3-2
---
Holosmith 3-2-3
---
(those traits are for bringing rifle turret instead of the grenade kit - if you were bringing a kit I think the traits might be different but I'm not 100%). 
---
Hmm that wound up being more than I meant to type. But! If you're interested in learning more about holosmith we have a form on the server where you can sign up to have a 1 on 1 session with a mentor who is more familiar with the class and can answer build/gearing questions.
---
Where is your basic moral compass? Why do you need a game corporation to give you a basic sense of what is appropriate when communicating with another person?
---
but at the time of the incident, you didnt know that they would investigate the situation but you didnt report them for verbal abuse.
---
Not on EU :&gt;
---
It's a shame that this (alleged) side project was shut down. GW2 is much better off now, but if the studio can't branch out, then its long term health doesn't look good. I enjoy mobile games, so I'd probably spend time and money on a GW2 related mobile app. I'd also be willing to try an unrelated mobile title made by ArenaNet. Maybe sometime in the future they'll hit a home run with an expansion, and have enough money to hire a mobile team without pulling anyone from GW2.
---
They should be able to see what the other guy typed after reviewing the match. And they definitely did review the chat log to see what I typed.
---
Just got into GW2 a month or two ago, playing a boosted Reaper and trying to gear up. I have a raptor and a springer but getting around Dragonfall to do events seems really difficult. Do I need gliding/flying to get around properly?
---
Only other idea is a pathing issue with your pet if it is fine on other proffs.
---
Basic moral compass? For saying a word I didn’t even mean? You are making this a bigger deal than it really is.
---
Leveling in open world and dungeons are very easy. Open world is catered towards everybody, so difficulty is easy. Dungeons were abandoned in 2013 or something, so the power creep from expansions make it trivial. Anything can pass in either content. For beginners, uses pistol pistol and spamming 3 works amazing. Use the assassin on cd, leave sigil of agility on passive, and the shadow’s refuge on top of hero points to channel them without wasting time on enemies. Daggerstorm for emergencies or thieves guild for a lil more dps. Pick traits carefully as they are powerful.
---
The best endgame thief build for raids and fractals (the 2 hardest pve content) will require the expansions.  The most notable thief build is [power staff daredevil](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/), which will require HoT expansion. It has one of the most simple rotations in the game, while still having one of the best dps. 
---
I recommend you check the website [snowcrows.com](snowcrows.com) for the meta raid builds. They can easily be applied to open world and fractals (unless you want to tryhard and optimize). The website will have every viable build for you. If you want a quick summary the here are the best options for each role:
---
Power dps: weaver, soulbeast, dragonhunter, daredevil
---
Condi dps: mirage, renegade
---
Support: renegade, firebrand, druid, chrono, warrior
---
These are the most typical options for each, but every class can fill each role to some extent. However, those listed above will usually have better dps, and supports in this game require specific compositions to supply crucial boons, heals and unique buffs.
---
So if you didn't mean it, you shouldn't have said it. Yeah, sometimes it's really that simple.

I personally have my rise / dive set to Q and E.  Easy to press while flying  
---
You can flap at around 80% of the bar being full  
---
The lighthouse in LA is great to practice flying!  
---
Hope this helps a bit!
---
I like it, but I won't buy outfits. Release these as actual armor, anet!
---
It's a Charr skin but named as an Old Ascalon sword? What?
---
The PoF mobs concentration seems decreased(at least I've seen in Crystal Oasis). Is that mentioned in any of the Patch Notes?
---
I do the same i have all 7 mounts and i started as 1 for raptor. 2 for bunny. 3 for skimmer. 4 for Jack. 5 griffon. 6 bettle. 7 skyscale in the order i got them so i dont. Get confused
---
it's not dead yet but it is dying. the warclaw caused a brief spike in players but that was only until they actually got the mount, they left again after that. the old WvW people probably moved to other games, ESO has a mode that is very similar and I wouldn't be surprised if that's where a lot of people have gone, of course this is just the pure WvW players, PvE, PvE &amp; WvW players have probably just stopped playing WvW and moved onto whatever other mode they like.
---
Use [GW2radial](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial). Much faster and easier to use than having to dig in your inventory for an item.
---
I can understand *why* they did it - having all your eggs in one basket is a risky proposition, and Anet has always been a generally creative studio that tries to focus on new ideas (for better or for worse). It makes sense that they'd invest in something that would have helped them branch out and keep a secure future while also flexing their creative muscles. 
---
It's just that they always seem to put the cart before the horse, wanting to move on to bigger or bolder things outside their means before they're ready. In this case the facade really didn't hold up. Players could really tell that it didn't seem like their heart was in the game. Release cadences got longer, new maps became more barren, QoL updates became more infrequent. It was obvious to anyone who's been playing the game for a while that they clearly were not putting effort into maintaining it at the level that users expected, and I don't know why they tried to pretend nothing was simmering in the background. 
---
Now that the focus is back on GW2 it's immediately apparent. New festivals and QoL improvements are coming out rapid-fire and communication is reaching levels we haven't seen in years. I only wish Anet could have done this, maintained *this* level of attention on GW2, before doing their other projects. Nobody would have complained, and perhaps not even noticed, if this was the bar that was set before GW2 was left to languish. Instead we got a year+ of inconsistent release quality and we have a dead project that might have been really cool. 
---
But as a GW1 player I guess I'm not unused to Anet absconding from their proven products to work on things they can't afford to maintain.
---
reaping doesnt have a tradeable version yet
---
Sending a new player to the pvp zone isn't simple because 1. Depending upon their free or paid player status, it may not be unlocked and 2. They'd have to do the PvP tutorial thing.
---
Just set up key bindings in a way that makes it convenient for you? You don't have to use the left side of the keyboard if you don't want to.
---
sickles only have one harvest per node, so the VM glyph may be better used on a pickaxe or logging axe, which usually have 3.
---
glyph of bounty is a good choice for a sickle or the newish glyph of the reaper, if you play wvw and harvest resource nodes in the objectives often.
---
  I have an apple keyboard without the side keypad so the issue I'm running into with that is the arrow keys and the way they are positioned, they jut sit there, with their only purpose being movement 😂 Ishouldjustgetakeyboardwithanumberpad
---
So you would suggest taking industry again, over leatherwork which gives mats?
---
You don't strictly need to use the arrow keys for movement though? Or the numberpad for skills? You can customize it however you want, like maybe get movement on IJKL and put your skills around that?
---
Atleast give us a croc mini!
---
Ah, only reason why I put vm on sickle, because in wvw there is a lot more sickle node 
---
Why bounty good for sickle if I may ask? Cos more chance for extra stuff when harvesting in wvw?
---
That was my idea, but you posted it before. Yep, start from zero, with just a few skills and actions, and take your time. Don't hesitate to remap for more convenience (we all have our preferences for healing skill, elite, Fx ...).
---
Dude if you have too much dragonite do the lions arch exterminator collection/achievement thingy and get the Karka that just eats it as the reward! I love that thing!
---
It does make a world of difference on that map.
---
Few more months?  
---
There are a lot of gold methods on youtube, Do fractals if you want fast daily gold, I do them and get like 20g a day.
---
You buy keys then farm boxes, You get so much for money from opening the boxes than spending 20s for keys.
---
You mean you are left handed using the mouse? 
---
Btw I am left handed but use the mouse right-handed.
---
Bounty with sickles is really great for harvesting Winterberries and Mistborn Motes. After a gathering run I end up with about ~50% more of them than without the Bounty. The glyph can roll up to 3 extra free harvests per node.
---
Yeah I literally and right handed in everything else except gaming, I use my mouse with my left hand 😭
---
It is alive, but every PvE event takes people away, even if only temporarily, and the current world boss event being two weeks long makes it all the more visible.
---
I guess what we would need is some more WvW events that are also interesting for otherwise non-WvW or not-so-much WvW players. A lack of ideas shouldn't be the problem I guess.
---
Thank you

In [this .gif](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/017/629/439/original/eric-dagley-volcano-timelapse.gif?1556745237), down in the grassy area at the bottom, you can see a character. I'm not sure if it's just a scale model or a possible playable character, but it looks like a chibi human female.
---
Did you try it at the mystic forge in LA? Wiki says it has to be La
---
i think its yours if you cant see it.
---
And could be a great gateway into GW2.
---
Matthias and xera are some of my favourites because they don't offload all mechanics to a select few players, but they are clearly the least favourite bosses in HoT. PoF bosses (except for CA) follow the same principle of shared responsibility instead of having a few players carry the rest. 
---
I think that's the reason I like them yet many people dislike them, though obviously that's just my interpretation based on my preferences and experiences.
---
Revenant tanks mob gangs with [Draft Stances Vengeful Hammers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vengeful_Hammers).
---
Yes officers, this comment over here.
---
Making a mobile title was the right decision. Neglecting your primary source of income to the point that players actively felt the cutbacks, while not announcing you were working on other projects, was not. At least before EotN came out Anet announced they were working on GW2. Then when most of the elite armor in that expac were reskins people didn't go "Wtf, why?"
---
You're welcome and good luck!
---
“The” bug? Now I’m intrigued. I’ve been talking about what I figured what an isolated incident...and also trying to poke fun at my inability to beat a dungeon after so many tries.
---
Unique design of the playable races is the reason GW2 becomes my ultimate MMOrpg. 
---
I feel I'm so spoiled by the playable character design of GW2 it is making me to refuse playing other MMOrpgs.
---
for the sake of economy, i hope no
---
Oh yeah I agree for instanced stuff, more of it too please!
---
This is one complaint I have about the game. You are forced to use certain weapons because they are the 'meta'.
---
I'd love to use my longbow. I got absolutely slated for using it during fractals. Forced to switch to scepter which just isn't as fun.
---
Sheer training. Muscle memory will link new over time
---
for a simple exotic sword? yes it is. Check out the tp for exotic swords and you will see what the average price for an exotic level 80 berserker sword is. Sure, there are "deluxe" skins that are made deliberately expensive. It's even cheap if you compare it to Black Lion skins but i honestly don't consider this sword to be "special".
---
So they try very hard to increase the ecto price. My 2k ectos like this.
---
Norms? Idk they’re tall? They lost all their land to some dragon.

---
Oh Norn cool I didn’t know their history lol.
---
Once again, using gw2efficiency for these kind of statictics is biased, because gw2effciency gives their result based on the total of registered accounts when it should give it based on the number of active accounts.
---
A good statistic would be something like "rate of completion of the raid by active accounts in the first X weeks since the wing was released". Of course gw2efficency can't give you info about inactive accounts but they could implement their own method like counting as active accounts that have accesed the site in the last X months or something along those lines.
---
Yea a dragon kicked them out of their homeland.
---
LA is unlocked after 35 level  I believe so they probably couldn't pass even if they got to PVP zone.
---
that makes me think.... are these prop's coded so they are always there but they just switch it invisible?
---
It's kind of a proof that the ad we saw a couple of months ago was really a mobile ad rebranded gw2.
---
The markers can be placed either by your cursor on the mini map + keybind or by putting cursor on terrain + keybind
---
I feel bad for thinking "oh thank god" upon reading this title.  
---
It looks nice!
---
I used to think the same way as you but then they are raid seller probably they will run with their guild exclusively and I never see them putting up another lfg other than for advertisement as well.
---
Can't see it ever happening, but I'd be really interested to hear Anet's take on these cancelled projects. We know they existed, they know we know they existed, so why not do a Guild Chat or a blog post talking about them, what their ideas were, if/how these titles were related to GW2 (as this concept art clearly seems to be), and so on.
---
Well they are working on new side projects. As much was said, when the layoffs happened. People like to pretend the layoffs were great because now 400 Anetdefs are working on gw2, when this is simply not the case. There are much fewer devs in total now and they are still split between gw2 and multiple new projects, only that the old projects were much further along the way.
---
Personally I would have loved to see anets take on a mobile game and hope to see one of the new projects come to fruition eventually.
---
Give her some pants first tho
---
That sounds like something Scarlet would have done.
---
doing a few days of daily plus some dungeons/fractals will easily give u more than enough to get 120 ectos. Heck. even open world farming silverwastes will give u enough. doing HoT meta events will give you enough.
---
I'm same with gw2 in general.  I used to do a lot of things solo, then found static for raids which I did for 2 years (kinda got pissed off because people were doing same mistakes over and over again with barely any improvement) and then completely stopped with pve outside of those few hours of LS episodes. 
---
Wvw was a breathe of fresh air and I started it with completely different mentality - cant get disappointed if you don't expect anything from people. Over time I met a lot of people and made a lot of friends so I play the game mostly because of that (if I even play it because discord is my main gw2 content nowadays lol).
---
It's 68
---
I know how to place them but I dont have enough keybinding for all the markers.. reason why a item would make it easier to place the markers and I dont have to remember which key binding was attached to which marker..
---
its a rpg sub after all...
---
yeah pretty much why I dont raid, Ive even managed to clear some of the wings pretty much flawlessly but that was only when my commander friend with legendary armor still played and brought me along, even then there were times we'd join a squad and Id get kicked immediately even after filling the requirements just because I don't play the top meta classes. I never got to get enough KP or LI to ever get into those groups and honestly KP and LI demands are what is killing raids as it makes raids seems hostile and unwelcoming not even to mention the fact some of the most toxic people in the game make up the raiding community. Like even in training raids people shit talk each other over one not doing max dps. Basically it feels like you got to either find a raiding group willing to let you come along, have enough friends interested or its going to be a nightmare breaking into raids.
---
I already keybinded a lot of keys, dont have any more space for all the markers...
---
What does completion rate mean?
---
Cooldown changes are included in the number tweaking, and that was your main concern, so..
---
Been doing Auric Basin event train with Sunny all week and I have 4 or 5 stacks of 250 rare unidentified gear.
---
This
---
please, no
---
They should rather compare the raid data to completion of the LS episode that was released at the same time (give or take a few weeks). The picture will be quite different, because all the dead efficiency accounts no longer artificially depress the completion rates of more recent content.
---
Thanks for posting this. Really interesting to see such an artstyle but that they apparently planned to have PvP and combat in general in the game. I guess we will never see what this should have become. I'm not super into smartphone games (I actually have not a single game installed on my phone) but I would have definitely checked it out and believe that if Anet ever releases a mobile game, that it will actually be good.
---
That, and also imagine you're doing a meta in tarir and one random gang of trolls decide it's fun camping in one line killing everyone that enter
---
&gt; Safe zones and PvP zones
---
Anywhere they afk farm could be a pvp zone.
---
So that's what those flashing candy corn nodes were...
---
True Shot has been crap ever since they gutted its damage. 
---
You have this huge channel animation and the shot barely feels stronger than your auto attack.
---
one time i managed to get a bug fixed... one time
---
What do you expect? Memes are stupid.
---
&gt; raids need to be a thing even if just for the minority of players.
---
I don't see why. If 80% of your playerbase does open world events(World Boss/Meta Rush Events) but raids only have 10-15% its simple math. I know people say "mah endgame" but endgame can mean so many things. Instanced raiding in GW2 goes agaisnt what GW2 is. Its something taken from others MMOs rather than have anet design something that fits GW2.
---
Getting awful Lineage 2 flashbacks from this post...
---
I'm really hoping they take advantage of the break between living world seasons (without an expansion on the horizon, yet) to do some much needed maintenance/repairs on existing content.
---
No no no no and hell no  , we have separate wvw and pvp for those who want that sort of thing
---
One of the things I like about gw2 is that the pve does not include pvp
---
Is it?
---
Probably because it's just completely false.
---
I'm not sure if you are on EU or NA but there are quite a lot of training runs to get you started in EU and 90% of them have no other requirement than "know the theory of the boss and come with a decent build" and they are filled pretty fast. Not sure about random training runs on NA but both EU and NA also have some well working training communities.
---
On a more personal opinion I think that pugging training runs is probably the worst context to actually learn raiding and it so much nicer inside dedicated training communities or through a static group that enjoys playing together. It's fine to take a couple of pugs to fill in when you can't fill your group through the community/static/friend list but a group mostly made of pugs is gonna be either a hard carry (because you may have a lot of experienced raiders joining to give a hand) or a complete nightmare (because you have people that don't really want to put in the same effort as you).
---
So if you are still for it I would encourage you either to find friends to start a static with or join one of [those communities](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) to get started and then try to find people you enjoy playing with.
---
For me it’s mostly just playing around with the wardrobe. I have a slot clear for a key farm character, so sometimes I will just play with that to see how I like characters. If I like them a lot, I consider buying another slot when they go on sale.
---
I try to vary my characters as much as possible, and many of my characters have multiple sets.
---
Often while playing I can build up a character for them depending on how they move or look, or the skills I like using with them. That helps me think of themes that I can base their outfits on.
---
Like my Sylvari Guardian, I was playing around with a Sceptre or Staff and wondered if I could make him a full spell caster look. And then I was using Caladbolg, so I though maybe I can make a look based on that.
---
Sometimes I use the same themes for several characters. Before I tried to masquerade looks for all my Sylvari and Human characters. A few of my characters have or had pirate looks.
---
Nope
---
No thanks. Im OK with duels but they need to add an option that autoamtically denies duel requests.
---
It's definitely hard to make out what the small character is, as from that distance it could either be a Chibi human or an Asura.
---
To be honest one specific area in open world with limited PvP could be interesting.
---
You can probably read the reply I just did right above (or below?) for a bit more detailed answer but basically
---
* Pug training is probably the worst place to try to start raids (and I join pug training a lot to give a hand) because not everybody is really fit to lead training runs in afriendly way
---
* Find yourself friend to start a static with or join a [training community](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) to get way more enjoyable start in raids with very nice people
---
&gt; You should be able to get back inside when you DC
---
not in that instance, it's just like home one, where you need opener to enter from same map you are in, to get the popup with ready check stuff (orange line).
---
but it isn't fun when they volunteer to join the pvp /s
---
I don't think you understand just how saturated the mobile market is. And the money is incredibly concentrated in very few highly successful titles.
---
So far, all glyphs become available on the trading post.
---
Larghos twins remind me of raid bosses in Vindictus. No gimmicks, just a straight up fight while dodging boss attacks. (As a dps player)
---
I should see what Vindictus is up to nowadays.
---
"Homestead".. "foothills", norn houses and bio mentions of "a mobile game", kinda goes without saying this was a GW2-themed mobile game. Without a doubt.
---
That item is called keyboard.
---
Thats not how it works though o.O the increments dont stay constant. Qadim the peerless wont continue to get 3% a week just like cairn isnt going to get 30% every 3 years. Take dhuum against CA as an example over its timeframe vs killrate.
---
What theyre trying to say is - a better graph would have been all raid boss kills in the timeframe of a week after release. This is nice info to see but its useless without a second constant such a time; aka its an unfair set of stats.
---
In efficiency you put an API key were you allow the website to go crawl all the info of your account however most of it is only visible by you (or you can control if other people can see what you have) but Efficiency uses this data to compute global stats for a bunch of info such has how many % of people have unlocked each achiev.
---
As with every stat/analysis done thanks to Efficiency it is indeed very much imperfect and potentially biased. I think the 2 biggest biases of Efficiency are probably:
---
* People that only tried out raids a bit (like a few easy bosses) but didn't do more are probably less likely to be on Efficiency
---
* The % of regular raiders on Efficiency is probably way higher than the % of non raiders on efficiency
---
This stat still has some interesting ideas but unfortunately the magnitude of the differences between bosses is kinda hard to guess more precisely.
---
1)Mainly is not clases its builds, and as it is build dependant is meta dependant(you can get destroyed by someone in a class you "have to beat"(asuming aproximate same skill level) because they come with a weird offmeta counterbuild designed to beat their "unfavored match")
---
2)beside some op builds it is only "favored  encounters" (on absolute equal skill you have a high percentage to win/lose depending on the side of "favored" you are)
---
That's what I'm currently doing, though the itch to craft the shinies already is real. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I am glad they are focussing on GW2 again but let's be honest: GW2 is many years old and still stable but the super successful time is over. Arenanet has to look in the future and i think a GW Mobile game could be a good idea. Mobile Gaming is the future that's a fact and no one can ignore this.
---
Has there been any information about the api getting fixed?
---
That does look beautiful.
---
&gt;Because Ascalon originally belonged to the Charr, the humans invaded them after their arrival to Tyria since at the time the humans where magically superior.
---
More accurately: Charr conquered Ascalon from grawl and dwarves, then humans conquered Ascalon from humans. It "originally belonged" to the charr for less than a generation, as it was conquered by the Khan-Ur and humanity conquered it through the infighting caused by the Khan-Ur's death.
---
Still an odd name for it though, since the legionnaire weapon design isn't centuries old. The weapon skin comes from Langmar's Estate - there's a sword, bow, and staff (bow is not among the datamined weapons likely to be coming from Mystic Forge events) where you put them into statue hands.
---
The charr in the city itself died during the Foefire blast. Those outside had nothing happen to them - though those who were just outside the city's fur turned white as they witnessed the Foefire.
---
It's explained pretty well in the Ghosts of Ascalon novel.
---
PC market making almost as much money as console games? That can't be right.
---
Guild Wars **Go**
---
We only donated stuff to the LA forge, so it makes sense its only obtainable there imo
---
to get a correct dataset, you could only compare the wings at the same total amount of tries. so lets say when the last wing has only 1k tries, you can use only the first 1k tries for the other wings. then it would be a fair comparison.
---
So ESO have organzied pug fights with 50 something players gather up with TS/Discord? If so were?
---
The hammer is under used and needs some love in general. That weapon is like an unwanted child..
---
"If playing a Danger Time.png Danger Time version, you should use full Berserker gear, except for Assassin's leggings and earrings."
---
From the metabattle build you linked.
---
&gt; Letting me pick a side is cool.
---
Uhm. I play GW2 and not WoW for a reason.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/947659#Comment_947659
---
Well, it is not simply "seeing something we have seen before" to me. It is seeing it through new eyes, both thanks to the changes in the past 250 years, but also the freedom of movement that comes from just having a z-axis, which GW1 lacked. And then add mounts to that, and it's suddenly experienced in a whole new way.
---
I'm one of those that didn't complete any of the PoF raids and only played HoT raids. there are many factors at play why this is the case.  1. I don't have the time  
---
2. I was only in the second raid group of the raid guild, those who did the raids twice a week and they went only HoT raids because they didn't buy PoF for those accounts.  
---
3. In november '18 those people started playing only once a week so I left the guild
---
4. since the balance update in december '18 I completely gave up my support mesmer because it's just trash, at least in normal PvE. and I also stopped playing Fractals.
---
Ah, yes. A very insightfull conversation indeed.
---
Same lul, since power soulbeasts dps is mediocore anyway. It only shines because of the burst potential.
---
Get to level 80 first, then decide. You don't need the expansions until then anyway.
---
Lol get your BDO filth out of GW2 go back to that scam game
---
20g to throw away on a skin presumes you have a lot more because this skin is probably not your top priority.
---
Step 1: Start the rift, then go land somewhere. Don't bother collecting anything.
---
Step 2: Wait 30 seconds or a minute until the rift appears again.
---
Step 3: Start the rift again. If you see the counter on your buff bar, you're good to go. If not, go to step 1.

For the sake of story, Heart of Thorns.

If you want those sweet, sweet mounts, Path of Fire os the way to go !
---
Wait for sale and get both for the same price.
---
Thanks, my dude!
---
Hey people who worked on this
---
I don't mean to offend you, but I'm really glad your project got sacked. Because a mobile tie-in to GW2 is the absolute last thing I would ever want or need from this series.
---
what exactly is glorious about w4
---
Also, one of the pieces described as "Final stage of a PvP championship concept" looks like GW1's Hall of Heroes
---
Either you die a hero or live long enough [become the villain](https://i.imgur.com/rQWLvTh.png).
---
That would be horrid tbh, ignoring that any meta would quickly become impossible is one thing but the amount it would dissuade new players from even accessing the expansion content would outright kill the game after getting zerged right out the door.
---
Now what would be fun is if they took 3-5 players and counted them as champions in some of the harder events putting them as enemies supporting the enemies in the metas giving them a cc bar and everything but having "boss" enemies that are fairly unpredictable in pve.
---
that explains why nothing happened earlier then
---
They've also re-hired a chunk of those who left btw, and not just big name ones. So its not as bad as people think. I don't know how many they re-hired, but there is definitely more people on GW2 now than before and its 100% apparent. Think I remember it being said it was more than just 1 project as well, and I don't understand why you don't think 100+ people would've been involved.
---
fun fact: It‘s the default female human ranger
---
Buy Path of Fire because it's 33% off from an official retailer atm (https://www.dlgamer.com/us/search?keywords=guild+wars+2).
---
Heart of Thorns gives you gliders as a mastery, which is like a permanent goblin glider you can deploy whenever you want, but it also interacts with some mechanics in the HoT maps.
---
Path of Fire gives you mounts, which will be a bigger deal than a glider if you can only have one for now. Mounts in GW2 are more robust than in WoW - we have a raptor to leap across rivers, a skimmer to travel very fast over water (like a water strider on steroids), we have a springer which leaps up tall cliffs in a single bound. They are very strong additions to your mobility in GW2, more so than mounts in WoW (aside from flying, which is unlimited in WoW but is more limited in GW2).
---
Personally I would buy Path of Fire, use the level 80 boost and do the first PoF mission to unlock the raptor mount across your entire account, even at level one. Then play wherever you want - continue with the core game story and map completion, start a new level one character with a mount, continue into Path of Fire if you like.
---
Oh really, that's cool then! Is there a discord like WvW discord for ESO to keep up with what's going on there?
---
It's either that or the Rollerbeetle's Barrier Smash for sure.
---
The amount of ppl who do this is actually very low. tbh, I only see those ppl here on reddit, and not at all ingame. Also 99% of us players dont have the gold to look like that... all these shiny and eye cancer posts are wildly exaggerated.
---
World bosses amount to nothing more than getting loads of people and spamming buttons anyway; there's no tactics.
---
Would you rather never die from falling damage again or have access to the best implemented MMO mounts in history?
---
The left hand side seems to have a few minor mistakes in the last phase. I put an overview on the "The Key of Ahdashim" page on the wiki. I think that one is correct.
---
even with the mote at the end, it's pretty dubious whether it's time well spent. I kinda think they were just running out of ideas.  
---
I feel like at the very least, the orbs should give 2-3 VM each... you know, like every other volatile orb. Getting single units of a currency only useful in the thousands or tens of thousands is one of the more mind-boggling decisions of this episode. Were they seriously worried that people would be able to farm these rifts so hard they could crash the material economy?
---
I find it the opposite. Here on Reddit people share awesome, well-planned outfits. Meanwhile in-game I see countless giant Charr characters with angel wings, pink glowing armour and infusions all over the place. It looks terrible.
---
Haha, that would be pretty funny if the Norn start going off to kill Jormag while everybody tries to stop them.
---
That was kinda my thinking with the suggestion of making it unblockable, but those are all good ideas too.
---
Yeah dude its not the super exclusive and elitist community, its the devs, what an awesome take you have.
---
You're making it for the skin. The exotic sword you also get is a bonus ecto gamble.
---
No Warclaw? D:
---
There is no need for this
---
discretize.eu offers you minmax gear based on your AR (which grants you concentration and precision), the more you have the less assassin and diviner gear you need
---
Minmaxing dungeon is a pain, moreover when you're downed to lvl 35..75 but it's mostly prestacking anyway
---
You won't raid but for your record it mostly depends on your mates (and the second Chrono) : you start with a lot of boon duration (60?) And then go lower as the group improves
---
Also, 5 men content is different from 10men content as your 5shield, SoI with inspiration trait and temporal rift are 10men, thus you will aim for more boon duration than in raid
---
I don't know about WvW
---
tl;dr check discretize.eu for fractals
---
If you are confident with your rotation, you can go low BD to maximise damage, however, if you are new to boon Chrono, you should aim for 80%-90% or even 100%. 
---
Concentration Sigil shouldn't be put on the shield but on the main-hand Sword, Impact or Paralization should be on the shield.
---
When playing Boon Chrono, your boons are more imortant than your DPS, especially if you are new. Once you are better with the class, you can go with a low BD setup to get as much DPS as possible.
---
10 gold is like an hour of playing.
---
So after the first instance. You guys can decide whether you like savannah or ice. If ice you can join your bro in wayfarers foothills and if savannah is the choice, your bro can come join u in plains of ashford
---
nope
---
i agree that these are, as they are, just stats.
---
but havign a specific mindset helps to better weight the different percentages here.
---
For example i am not surprised only 10% has done stuff after w4, nor do i think this is a bad signal. It's just that the signal is warped, and a 33% people that have done VG means less if 10% has done soulless horror.
---
Obviously it remains reasonable that more people did vg rather SH ( even if i find SH easier, and i am among those that killed VG but not SH) and i can't give a proper proportion to frame that, but it should nto surprise.
---
would be nice if they also increased the number of character slots we could buy.
---
This looks amazing! Well done :D
---
&gt; The Civil War idea as is has got to be the stupidest concept I've heard of for the GW2 story.
---
It's petty drama for the sake of drama, just like BFA in WoW was. Stupid dumb shit.
---
?? Hey man this video was never supposed to be released I am putting my family’s life in danger releasing it.
---
Not using this as a negative, just an illustration of perhaps why we see it differently. I would imagine a chef is very detail oriented. You're looking at the trees. As management, I was looking at the forest. You can sacrifice a rook in chess to win the game. There's not necessarily a directly relationship between what you do in business, and your success...or at least not an obvious one. There's a saying in retail that only 10% of your advertising actually works, but it's almost impossible to tell which 10% so you have to do it all.   If raids pull players into the game, even though they don't end up raiding, but they do end up staying, it's an investment that can't be overlooked.
---
Again,. I'm not sure that's necessarily the case, but I wouldn't discount the possibility. Raids are end game content in so many games, a game without raids might well be taken less seriously by a decent percentage of long time MMO players. If you don't get people through the door, you can't possibly show them how good your game is.
---
For me, it's usually a helm/back/shoulder/weapon that inspires me.
---
For my Druid, I wanted to make something cool out of Yggdrasil+Wayfarer's Henge.
---
For my Daredevil, I wanted to make her look like a Dervish, using Final Rest (cheapest scythe-style skin I could find).
---
For my Necro (not gotten around to it yet, he still needs better armor before I will waste transmute charges on him), I am inspired to a Tomb Lich kind of look from Banners of Dynastic Reckoning.
---
You sound unusually bitter.
---
Nerf Scourge
---
It's been proven that artificial scarcity results in higher overall sales. If you knew that character slots only go on sale twice a year, then you would more inclined to panic buy more character slots than you need at the moment. If the slots go on sale every month, a person would just say "I will just wait the next sale if I end up needing more slots".

If you are going by enjoyment of the maps, then I would say, from LS3:
---
Episode 2, Episode 5, Episode 6
---
LS4:
---
Episode 1, Episode 4, Episode 6 (but you should have that already)
---
For pure farm efficiency/importance of farms, probably.
---
LS3:
---
Episode 3, Episode 4
---
Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 5, Episode 6 (should have this one).
---
Mobile should always be an alternate platform, not a separate one.
---
Making a mobile game that won't be playable in PC or won't have any ties with a PC game will generally not be appreciate when your core audience is PC.
---
Now, if it was a cross-platform version, with different graphics, but the same content, it would have worked great, as it would allow you to play the same game elsewhere.
---
As someone who finished his path to Convenience Wars 2 quite a while ago, let me assure you, it's everything you ever dreamt of and more.
---
In GW1, I could easily imagine some Melandru-worshipping Eostra event!
---
I’ve had it work occasionally.
---
I like the rifts because at the very least, they offer a quick path to gain more altitude in some areas
---
Well. Iam not talking about a get good or leave kind of learning curve. In other MMOs getting in touch with dungeons and team play is part of the story and leveling process.  That has nothing to do with breeding hardcore raiders, just getting in touch with the game mechanics and what is the vital part of an MMO. Other players.
---
GW2 totally throw that overboard. Dungeons are dead or dreadful to get into and apart from a message you get once your first reach the level nothing points you towards dungeons, nor are they required to progress the story. So the first time you actually play your class and the game is when you reach max level and start doing fractals and raids. 
---
Ofcourse people struggle and are afraid or annoyed at the sudden difficulty increase. Its not their fault either.
---
Nope. 
---
You get like 50g a month by logging in alone without playing one second...
---
You can keybind with multiple keys I have mine as:
---
Alt+1 , Alt+2 
---
And so on. Bet you can come up with some combo yourself. Plenty on keys on your keyboard.
---
Yeah, same for me.
---
I'd put them more in the camp of melee cleric than strict paladin as they have a heavier magic focus than a paladin from most other rpgs. They're probably as close as you'll get to a paladin though. You may also like revenant if you're looking for heavily armor martial and magic classes, but the Rev doesn't really have much of a paladin aesthetic.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Hall_of_Heroes  
---
Was my thought exactly
---
It's something else to do while waiting for world bosses once you've gathered all nearby nodes, as every world boss has one nearby.
---
Yeah but necromancer is more like death Knight.
---
In some points they create air bridges that allow you to reach certain faraway points pretty fast if you can use the barrel rolls well.
---
That was some good coordination actually.  Would you mind sharing your build?
---
This game allowed me to follow my dreams. If I want to be a light bulb, I will be the brightest bulb!
---
That's kind of my big issue, it's not a "I like Longbow, so make it the best ever" but more of "I'm really sick of Scepter being my only viable ranged tool on DH"
---
Those are likely waiting until they fix the bug that prevents the counter to be applied on the first try.
---
Y'know you could just use your big brain and start a group of like-minded people, right?
---
Disliking the attitudes of "toxic elitists" is completely irrelevant you fucking moron.
---
Can't have all.
---
cool, but why color them orange instead of just removing them?  I noticed they have a nearly completed Combat Replay going already from the nice folks at dps.report (and prob collab with elite insights).  
---
Last I checked, they were just missing marks for manually placed pillars
---
If you cannot wait for the bundle with the 2 expac, definetly Hearth of Thrones
---
My game keeps needing to repair, this is the 2nd time in 10 hours that a repair was necessary. Anyone else having this issue?
---
Fuck no.
---
Just feels so sluggish and slow. I've always disliked it along with warrior LB for how slow they actually shoot, but at least the warrior's LB non auto attack skills are faster to complete. Guardian LB feels like it takes ages, the scepter/focus combo can do its whole rotation twice as fast, and has a defensive/quick cc option.
---
Kinda sucks cause it's a real pretty weapon too, with beautiful skills..
---
I'd argue that, in many MMORPGs, and from many players, they find the leveling content tedious and boring, and want to experiment the endgame asap. We see that with the people lost when using lvl 80 boost on first character.
---
But you're not wrong overall, GW2 is a sandbox, not a definite questline with tutorials every 50m.
---
Not to mention we get less and less new armor sets each patch to the point where it’s exciting when we get *one* in a patch that you can actively earn while other MMOs generally get about 5 every patch.  The excellent dye system thankfully can help use get a lot out of very little, but still it would be nice to see more new armor added in a game that’s supposed to be about cosmetics at endgame.  Unless the main way to “earn” new armor is *supposed* to be mindlessly grinding gold to buy stuff off the store.
---
That’s a bit too glowy for my taste but I do like how it matches :)
---
I saw advertisements for Guild Wars 2 all over the place, especially for the release of expansions. MMO news websites also covered it and so did at least some other gaming publications.
---
I'm pretty sure they just don't have the budget for it, or they're using it for something else?  Big Christmas bonus? 
---
They're slowly improving tho!
---
People still don't get this. It's not about raid wing being fun nor it's about raid wing being easy. It's about how many encouters there're and about release schedule. I'll tell you this: 99% of raiding community would be happy with raid wings locations being just a pile of reused assets and models if time between releases would be 4-5months and each wing would contain 5-8 bosses.
---
Dwarves/Forgotten/Grawl were there before Charr so even in that context it makes no sense. Also it's a fairly modern design.
---
Yes, they have a beatiful game in their hands, yet they managed to show it bad-looking. Heart of Thorns spec trailers and new lightsaber trailer...
---
&gt; while not announcing they were working on other projects
---
They were openly hiring developers for mobile projects, so it's hard to say that they did not announce the fact that they are working on other projects. Everyone knew they were working on something, nobody knew on how big scale.
---
/Salute @
---
I'd focus on a suboptimal gear while grinding for a leg armor and using Buildtemplate tough
---
Kakashi sensei?
---
well yeah you are right, but they try to improve that, as it looks, because after the layoffs, there were commercials on youtube and also commercials on the streets
---
HoT was announced at E3 literally the biggest showcase for any game so if you didn't know it was a thing you clearly didn't read much gaming news back then...
---
And it's in line with how foefire human ghosts look like, but the weapon is modern charr iron.. but a ghost version. Makes no sense.
---
I guess whoever made this doesn't know the lore and just needed an ecto sink.
---
XP boosters sell for 2-4 coppers on trading post. Also yellow name mobs gives more XP. Still, NEVER skip world exploration.
---
Er, are the players supposed to be LGBTQ+ or are the characters supposed to? Also, kinda interesting that  Columbia University uses LGBTQ+ as the acronym. Most universities I've seen use LGBTQIA+ or just LGBT+. I've seen LGBTQ before, but that was for like half a year maybe a decade ago? Never seen LGBTQ+ before.
---
It is pretty self-explanatory. If developers focused all their resources on what makes them money instead of what their players enjoy you'll be left with a barebones lootbox simulator. Playerbase growth is not always related to certain types of content but the game and the industry as a whole. You can't expect a seven year old MMO to suddenly see a growth just because they decide to sack a part of their game. I know people that used to enjoy dungeons back when they were the only PvE group type content and stopped playing after years of neglect. I'm not sure what kind of answer you're looking for.
---
[My female charr deadeye](https://i.imgur.com/IHmx7ho.png).
---
They spend all of their money advertising the LS which in the end is 2 hours worth of content and the only people who care about it are existing players. 
---
They need to focus more advertising in the WvW and Spvp modes. WvW especially is their most unique modes. I have friends who never even knew WvW was a thing. But in the end Anet will cater and advertise to the casual audience.
---
If you bring up how gaudy they (infusions)  look in map chat you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Literally the last 3 tweets from the GW2 account are promoting twitch streams.
---
The HoT expansion was pushed heavily and announced too early. When HoT didn't meet community expectations, it cost the game money. Today I think as many people like HoT as PoF, maybe even more, but back then, it was a fiasco. The higher you hype the expansion the higher you set the bar.
---
PoF was a better received expansion over all, with higher "marks" from both players and the media.  But it wasn't hyped and so the bar for expectations was set pretty low. 
---
That said, I did see some PoF coverage, at not only MMO and gaming sites, but also ads on places like Facebook.
---
Man she’s cool!
---
I believe the only existing way to skip the fractal title grind is to open fractal encryption keys at a rate of .3 relics per cracked encryption, for a cost of about 30.5 + 21 = 51.5s; assuming you can get both components in bulk around current sell prices.
---
The first fractal title is 25000 + (15 x 75) fractal relics, so that's 87083 cracked encryptions for an investment of about 44847.74 gold with some return, but a loss overall of varying severity depending on your source.
---
Assuming Prof. Mew has an average salvage return of ~3 relics (not including rare drops), that's only 8709 to get the first title. Prices would skyrocket as people buy titles, but they'd definitely be lower cost than encryptions without the expected gold / material return of opening them. A few early investors would buy their way to fractal god in seconds.
---
Cool idea, but I think it's a little OP :)
---
Same
---
the ren just puts on Mallyx to strip NPNG
---
Aww...I forgot those features.....
---
And this is what it's [all about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rCKMm2bDyE).
---
Why would you need to level faster. Even without every buff, it's not that hard to get a level every ten minutes or so, if you're buffing up and killing creatures with high bonus experience. With all the buffs you can get that to a level almost every five minutes, particularly if you have someone killing with you.  Seems to me you shouldn't have to go much faster than that.
---
Same time like last year probably.
---
The Reddit GW2 community has been extremely vocal in recognizing the poor marketing and simply lack of marketing for GW2 and has called on the developers many times to do a better job of it and in recent months, they have made significant improvements. They have been running ads online and physical ads in major US cities in the past few months. 
---
However, as other comments have noted this post seems to be exaggerating the problem. Even as bad as they were - and they really were - it is difficult to imagine someone spending 60 hours a week online and not having heard of PoF if they were involved with gaming, websites that concern gaming, or social media. There was certainly enough publicity in these venues for someone to have heard of it.
---
Yeah, I actually quit GW2 years ago because I was leveling and it was so goddamn boring. I came back after HoT came out, leveled up through crafting or something and actually started to enjoy the game!
---
Leveling is extremely easy in GW2. Every single activity you do gives you exp. You are literally showered in exp - all you have to do is play the game instead of standing around afking or talking to people.
---
Once you're 30, start doing daily dungeon runs. They will net you quite a lot of exp on your first clears for the day.
---
Weapon speed and clunkyness of using the skills since nearly all of them force you to stay stationary and are extremely easy to accidentally cancel during normal combat.  
---
This has been magnified even more with the mobs we face recently who both move more themselves and punish stationary targets even harder (like people performing long cast skills)  
---
Warrior's hammer still has a lot of the same issues too with pre and post cast animation lock-ups.  Ive seen this a lot with guard's hammer 2, 4 and 5 somewhat recently (last few months) when I got curious and tried them both out again as well.
---
I'd like to upvote but you're already at 69 upvotes so I physically can't
---
It has to be. This collection has been my least favorite time playing this game. I’m sure no devs have gone about trying to get this mount naturally. It’s awful.
---
Someone hasn’t been paying attention...
---
Getting high boon duration in fractals is easier than elsewhere, because you get 15% for free from the mist mobility potion (mastery gives it bonus effect that it turns AR into concentration).
---
Diviner trinkets, pack runes, sigil of concentration and proper food/utility (soul pastry, potent lucent oil) are enough to get you to 80% boon duration (95% in fractals).
---
If you are skilled enough, you should be able to achieve full quickness and alacrity uptime with boon duration as low as 60-70%, which means you can run some assassin/berserker trinkets for more damage.
---
Raptors are not good at climbing hills. Jackal imo is way better as the horizontal movement isnt as impared as with the jackal once you hit a slope. Might just be me though
---
You’re looking for WvW.
---
I am not sure regular sales lead to more profit. If more people are like me no one would buy anything during no-sales time and just wait until its price is reduced again.
---
Nope. Map currency is a mood killer. Never do this again Anet. Please
---
The mobile market is saturated with shovelware and cash grab games. There are very few "AAA" mobile games. There is a ton of space for good mobile games.
---
Same, ive not actually seen an in game dipshit load themselves up like that. thought it was an amusing anomoly for funzies for the reddit communnity
---
zerk sb lb2 seemed impactful the last time I was hit by one

live long enough and the "80's" will be back i guess.
---
Decap and run from everything. Only fight if it’s a +1. Best game mode.
---
Their idea of the Pact re-splitting along faction lines is pretty dumb, but I could actually see a variation of this working pretty well, if it was based around Aurene, and people's reactions to the end of War Eternal.
---
The Pact was formed to fight dragons, but now there's this new dragon, that's just absorbed a ton of magic.  As the commander, we have a relationship with Aurene so we are (relatively) certain she is on our side, but it'd be totally reasonable for other people to feel a little uneasy about this development. With Caithe's transformation, and the rise of the "Crystal Bloom" faction we see in Dragonfall, I could totally see a rift form in the Pact between people who support Aurene, and people who think all dragons are bad, Aurene's branding is just another form of corruption, and that the Pact should start making preparations to go after Aurene.
---
The civil war idea is a garbage fire holy shit.
---
Ah, Escort!  The one raid you took your too-casual-to-change-gear guildies so they can unlock the raid mastery track and stop complaining about locked masteries being an eye sore.
---
As for everything else... I have yet to get a Xera or Deimos kill and have too little pull experience on them to just randomly pug it.  And I haven't even attempted the other two wings.  Have the gear, just don't have the patience.
---
More likely it would have killed GW2 entirely once those mobile bucks started pouring in. It would have become the focus or maybe I'm pessimistic.
---
Personally I think they're doing decent on marketing (especially these past few months), but yeah there is areas they could definitely do more for. Like one particular thing that just seems woefully underutilized is their Twitch presence. They do streams and tweet out/host people that record content related to Guild Wars, but there's so much more they could do to better cultivate more (or strengthen current) content creators and attract more viewership to GW2 on Twitch. 
---
One thing that ESO has done that's been massively successful is adding in the ability to [link your Twitch with your ESO account and earn rewards during special event times by just watching Twitch streamers of their game](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/26399). Like if you look at the stats of these ESO streamers, it's jumped them up considerably and bumped up the viewership of ESO on Twitch when they enable them. GW2 could easily do something similar and use things as simple as the [Black Lion Statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette) as rewards.
---
The core issue is its low DPS. It does get employed in play modes where DPS is not an issue, like spvp.   
---
Honestly they should completely disperse with the notion that most ranged weapons should be penalized with low DPS to compensate for their range. It's dysfunctional in the game as it is.
---
Not quite, but it is on its last legs, I feel. At this point, I doubt the pipe dream that is Alliances can fix it.
---
Damn people downvoting you for taking away the only way they can be relevant.. ezclap scrubs, lrn2dps. Downvote me ladyboys
---
&gt;There's not necessarily a directly relationship between what you do in business, and your success
---
But there's a link between what you do *wrong* in your business and your failure to maintain it. And there are other ways to get people in through the door. I'm probably wrong but if you are a salesman you go and sell, you don't wait for a person to come buy what you are offering, specially if your product is already being sold by someone else.
---
I don't really recall what our discussion was about, just really enjoying this back and forth.
---
&gt; We just recently seem to have gotten beyond the Longbow Soulbeast meta and them spamming Longbow 2 was exhausting enough.
---
Glass cannon builds should have natural counters.   
---
Zerg blobbing should have natural counters.   
---
Not that lb rangers were effective as either since they offer nothing that combats the real issues of WvW (weak AOE, target caps, stability/missile reflect spam), but lb guardians would suffer from all of these problems in the role of ranged DPS/snipers/skirmishers, while being flat out inferior.
---
What we think happens is that whoever is closest to boss after 20% and just before the special action key becomes locked, becomes tank and first tether. But its not conclusive.
---
We just had healscourge and bs with tank bite the "tether" to keep tank alive and adds cc'ed.
---
Range definitely goes from first tethered person, so if tank stands north, then you can get pretty close on south side for range attacking.
---
&gt; I don't know what you have done or not but have you tried to gather friends and randoms to setup a progression/training group? If not what held you back? 
---
Honestly, that's probably what I'm going to have to end up doing. I was part of a guild where we were doing that a few months back but then the guild completely fell apart, and I've been too demotivated to try it again as of yet.
---
Apart from the gliders and mounts you should also look at the different specialisations that you get from each expansion. Which game modes you play and what classes you want to play will rely heavily on this.
---
Doesn't matter if your skill was turned off before it gets locked; it automatically gets forced on when the skill gets locked.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; Because it is?
---
It's like thinking that everybody who drives a car, only do that to pollute the environment. 
---
It's not wrong right? They do pollute the environment. But it's not the reason people drive car and that's the point. 
---
Also, iIrc some of these skins are already in the game, but NPC only. And for like every NPC only weapon and armor, you can find people wanting this available for players, too.
---
And now you are at a point, where you can see it as "Anet listen to players", which is a good thing; or you can see it as "They just copy paste skins, to give us something", which most people think is a bad thing.
---
I mean, Anet seems to be ok with just labeling half the weapons in their game "pvp weapons" so they don't have to balance them for two seperate modes.
---
&gt;And while NCSoft has made some shitty decisions in the past (cough killing City of Heroes) this was definitely the right move for them to refocus Arenanet on Guild Wars 2.
---
But how do we know it wasnt NCsoft that "forced" aNet to focus on mobile?
---
I mean it could very well gone like this:
---
**NCsoft:** Ok Mobile gaming is booming, pls make something cool
---
**Anet:** Ok lets do something cool (and maybe re-invent wheel to stand out)
---
**NCsoft**: Fug, wildstar failed and mmos are having problems. We heard hero shooters are the rage now. Or loot and shoots like destiny. Something for western markets. Maybe try that?
---
**NCsoft:** lol just focus on gw2 and lay-off ppl we are losing shareholders intrest we need to fix that.
---
Firstly I think that's a dumb analogy. Second - a very small part of GW2 players have a set up API on that website. Even if we decide that the percentages are accurate for all accounts it still doesn't look bad. Do you think a majority of players clear mythic raids in WoW too or Ultimate difficulty in FFXIV? Why don't you ask yourself why these other games also keep delivering content for a small part of their playerbase? It will be a nice experiment. Remove all content but open world and living story and let's see how the game will improve according to your armchair CEO advice.
---
Who remembers when Balthazar outfit dyed Abyss Black was the hip thing.
---
Could be nice.
---
Would need some glowing white or blue fire animations but that would be preferable.
---
All WvW clips that get posted here look the same. Two groups clashing against each other, sometimes stealthed and then giant pulsing scourge AoEs und spellbreaker bubbles until the enemy is dead.
---
Seriously. 20g for a shitty ghostly swap of the racial sword is not "expensive" but there's a ton of black lion weapons I could buy for less than that. It's more like it's expensive in comparison.
---
That would be the easiest fix, however it wouldn't really solve the issues of the long cast time and that stability/teleports are everywhere anymore.
---
Oh, god. pls. no.
---
Is that a revenant? Looks like some type of sand ninja
---
i really love your armor combo :D
---
Why are people downvoting this lol wtf
---
when you do those kind of massive purchases on alt accounts you must have some kind of financial gain goal not an storage problem. If you just wanted it as an storage it would be impractical because if you purchase those 4000 stacks of gossamer and then you need some item purchase fast you would need to retrieve those 4000 stacks first because you can get that item you need.
---
yeah, and my argument is that the skin in question is not any prestige skin. The price you pay to craft it is too high.
---
What about people completing the raids with different accounts? though is probably not many to justify adding it.
---
FUCK NO.
---
Well we did for one fight of one LS,  not in good form either.  I was always thinking since he is rather slow perhaps that is a long term catalyst for reverting.
---
was already posted days ago

Who made this atrocity? Why does the core count stop at an even number? Where is core 0?

I'm still in favor of making a new system with them where you can fuse copies to strengthen them and use them for mini combat.
---
In my opinion this is pne of the best GW2 arts I’ve ever seen.
---
Well I look at the fact that Blade and Soul 2 and Blade and Soul M are both being developed. NCSoft hasn't decided to dump PC gaming all together.
---
I'm only missing a few though and yest, the perma bank access is so good. I probably cannot play without it anymore lol.
---
I’ll say two words that will boost this game sp hard. Twitch drops...
---
so you are saying this game needs more dead content?
---
The feeling when people trying to make excuses whenever they do something stupid -_-
---
So a skull system like tibia? Yellow skull should be for people attacking skull players
---
His sword belongs to his dead brother, doesn't it? I don't think he'll ditch that any time soon.

If would suggest doing that. I play left handed, and having everything right there is pretty convenient.

Nice cover-up.
---
Yeah, just feels like I'm playing fuckin tennis with my enemies.

Sinister but true. :)

Though, for those waiting for sales, March (if I recall right) and August (near GW2's birthday) tend to be good times to stock up on deals. Save those pennies/gems now.

Otherwise, having "regular" sales on things would blunt the scarcity effect. Kind of similarly to how having a festival/event accessible year round would cause more players to ignore them "because they'll always be there."
---
I see you met my brother ( i look like alucard from helsing ultimate)
---
NA HoD has coverage
---
...I admit to giggling.
---
All the trinkets is 38.73% http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQBAA-jhghBAgyvQJIA-e
---
Same. I've run out of builds to experiment with and character themes to make, so what I really need is a better character-select screen.
---
Every game is fashion wars.
---
If you want a true fashion war game, Play warframe. :P
---
Yes, it does
---
&gt;Maybe if you are going for astronomical one shot numbers like this, then you have to run glass,
---
Not really.  The numbers in the spreadsheet I made, the minimum and maximum damage is only just a oneshot for classes with low hp and running glass already.  Marauder's gear makes this even more difficult to pull off.
---
&gt; Between the block, evades, GS leap, snow owl leap, stone signet, you can survive a lot. Plus it can outrange anything.
---
So if I roll daredevil thief with agility signet, endurance heal, shadowstep, bandit's defense, and marauder's gear, I'm now a tank because I can disengage to reset due to having a fair few dodges. 
---
&gt;So it has massive damage buffs, incredible mobility, unmatched range, and decent defenses. It's way too strong as a roamer.
---
Find cover behind a tree.  Axe requires they're within 900 range.  Greatsword requires them to be in melee.  Line of sight is this build's greatest enemy.  There are also builds that directly counter it.  Off the top of my head, there's an ele roaming build that uses earth and denies enemy critical hits.  This really stops all the oneshots.
---
With the advent of raids, support-centric class builds have become a very real thing. New stat sets such as Harrier (Power/Healing/Concentration) and Diviner (Power/Concentration/Precision/Ferocity) have made support builds easier to gear up too. Some common builds include:
---
* Druid - popular healing class that also provides large amounts of might and ranger buffs such as Spotter and the elemental spirits.
---
* Chronomancer - boon support class capable of handing out both quickness and alacrity.
---
* Firebrand - thanks to the new Diviner gear set, it’s able to upkeep permanent group quickness while also providing adequate dps. Or can use Harrier or Minstrel stats to become a main healer while still providing quickness.
---
* Renegade - the counterpart to Firebrand, able to keep up permanent alacrity while also providing adequate dps. Like Firebrand, it also has a main healer variant using Harrier stats.
---
* Tempest - probably unmatched as far as raw group healing goes, but with less offensive buffs compared to other support classes.
---
* Scourge - instead of healing, it can focus on granting massive barriers to mitigate damage, giving it an interesting niche in raids.
---
um it's called the keyboard?

"Ranked arenas require the account to reach PvP Rank 20 and above before participating."
---
Before you rant remember there is a minimum in unranked you have to go through before you are allowed to que for ranked.  Yeah it doesnt test skill but you are mad at people for being ignorant while being ignorant.
---
The only reason the Kodan left their original home was because of Jormag they didn't do it just to have a change scenery. The Kodan wouldn't move unless Jormag started making trouble for them again.
---
Reaching a certain rank is still trivial and doesn't attest to skill. Stricter entry requirement is mandatory to ensure the unskilled stay out of league games.
---
Create a char with whatever class, go to the pvp lobby, and test it out!  You're boosted to 80 there with all of the elite specs unlocked, so you can see if you like it.  If not, delete the toon and try a different class.  Rinse and repeat until you find 2 you like!
---
The guy is mistaking 100x and 100% damage. It's easy to get +100% damage, but I'm pretty sure you can't multiply your damage 100x.
---
The base 880 damage would have to be 88k backstab. That's without armor.
---
I mean if you get matched with someone who just started pvp then maybe your rank suck ass.
---
And the ascension is by no means only for pros or whatever you want to call it, if you want an elite reward then look at titles and mt rewards.
---
PvP population is already very low (matchmaking throws golds into plat matches fairly regularly) so shrinking that population even more sounds like a bad idea. Also I'm not really sure what you think requiring a win ratio will solve if you are upset you're getting these people in the first place. They'll just drag you down with them and then you won't be able to play either.
---
To be fair, ArenaNet **did** seed in possibilities for the Pact fracturing over the past couple years. This was primarily focused around Aurene and the need to "not kill Elder Dragons", though, and it died out in a grand unsung plummet of droppings with All or Nothing and War Eternal.
---
The notion being, like with Braham's little situation, that many people within the Pact - among all the three orders - hold too great a grudge and do not trust Dragon's Watch's words of "we can't kill the ED because world death" as they're "serving" the scion of an Elder Dragon (Aurene), and rally behind Braham's reforged Destiny's Edge (which, in the theory, would include Zojja, Braham, and Rox as the core pillars) to kill the Elder Dragons.
---
Not a flawless premise, but could have held potential. And actually made sense.
---
I believe you can do the story with a friend, have your friend start the instance so even if you do disconnect they can just wait for you to get back inside and continue the story.  (doing the other way around the story instance would close) 
---
Though I guess if you already deleted her this is out of the question now.
---
If needed, you can send me a mail and I'll get one of my characters to that stage in the story, as long as you're playing on NA.
---
Or worse - like me - waiting for shared inventory limit to increase so I can buy 5 at once ON SALE to get increased savings from both the sale and the bulk purchase of 5 instead of 3 or 1. And so the waiting game continues..

Sadly, I play on EU, though you are super kind to offer!
---
Axes:
---
Inexpensive (read: not the best, maybe, but not so hard to get): Warden Axe, Corrupted Skeggox, Fractal Axe
---
Price is no object: Astralaria, Frosfang, Dreamthistle Axe
---
Pistols:
---
Inexpensive: In addition to the similar-to list of the other inexpensive axes, Super Pistol, Bloodlily. 
---
Spendy: Tempest pistol, Glittering Pistol, Glacial pistol.
---
Stories that GW2 could tell without dragons: Dozens.
---
Gaheron, Kudu, Ulgoth, Caudecus, Lazarus, Joko, Dhuum, Menzies, Faolain / Cadeyrn, the Separatists, Renegades, Bangar Ruinbringer, Mai Trin and the mysterious unspoken leaders of the Molten Alliance...
---
These were all villains that could have played major roles. Instead, they either got swept under the rug in 0.5 seconds screentime, or get so ignored I bet people don't know half the names I mentioned.
---
Stories that GW2 *will* tell without dragons: None.
---
For whatever reason, ArenaNet plants seeds for good, interesting plots, and then goes nowhere with them. The sylvari hatred in HoT, the division between Dragon's Watch and Destiny's Edge and "saving the dragons" versus "killing the dragons", hatred and fear of Aurene, Lazarus, Menzies, even Joko really, were all things that could have had lasting, true plots to them, but ArenaNet glossed over. Joko got the most attention, and that was "stretching too much" by ArenaNet's view.
---
* Here's the best shiny legendary mount skin in the core game.
---
* Remove it from the core game preemptively and instead make it only unlockable by reaching rank 1000 in the mobile game.
---
* To unlock it in the mobile game, you need to either do mindbogglingly repetitive boring mobile game screen tappings for 1 hour for 1 year daily, or spend 300-500 USD on RNG chests that boost your experience.
---
* ...and now make 50 more items like that and call it "rewarding the loyal playerbase"!
---
Praise the Mother of Kralkatorik! You heard it from me first.
---
The second build slots hit the gem store, arc would get a cease and desist on that feature from ANET's lawyers...
---
Im sorry but your system is just idiotic. 
---
First of all why are newer players not allowed in ranked? We all sucked at one point and if you dont know what youre doing after rank 20 then you wont play pvp for long before you ask yourself "okay what am i doing wrong"
---
Second, as a plat 1 player i have many friends who queue with me and end up with less then 50% win ratio, yet have way higher rating then other people with a 60+ win ratio. Simply cause they play agianst higher rated opponents. 
---
How will a winratio in UNranked (or rather anything for that matter) qualify for anything? If you happen to go unranked vs some guild of good/top tier players since they cant do ranked with 3 or more, youre very much screwed.
---
To me you just lost a match with an unskilled player and are frustrated about it. If you play a couple hundred more this season im sure youll play agianst some unskilled ones and win a match. Your score will even itself out anyway..
---
And 2 seasons ago i started with 8 losses and 2 wins as placement. So in your eyes i shouldnt be allowed to compete anymore, yet i ended in a decent plat level. Only lost cause i was goofing around on builds i dont master.
---
So im sorry but your system seems completely out of line to me.
---
I just thought that they were a way for you to get super high on your skyscale, land high, and then be able to soar wherever you want. I kind of like it, since I actually feel like I'm truly flying.
---
Grinding new gear for all your characters also results in new skins.
---
It's also something that just sorta happens as you play---If you play the game and do the content, you'll get the gear you need.
---
For some of us, it's the entire reason we prefer GW2 over other MMOs. Obviously there are a lot of other great reasons too, but oh boy do I love that fashion baybee
---
I mean, it will.  Anet hasn’t yet skipped one going into the BLC.
---
Hey /u/Minor_Miss_Demeanor and friends! 
---
I did some poking around on the Known Issue Tracker this morning and got a really quick and dirty table whipped up that will allow us to manually track a few of our most prevalent issues. It won't be updated as often (or be nearly as pretty) as the existing tables, but hopefully it helps in the meantime!
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker
---
Enjoy! 	(´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡
---
At its core, Guild Wars has always been a story about people working together despite their differences to further a greater cause. I think that making Orcs vs. Humans-style conflict central to any of their major narratives would turn many people, myself included, off.
---
What the fuck did I just watch.
---
I never said they don't. It's just that ranked league matches are not for everyone and The Ascension is definitely not for some rando semi-afk PvE scrub.
---
While that may be true, calling the game “fashion wars” gives potential players the portrayal that it’s all there is to do.
---
As for myself I play “completion wars” if we want to keep the meme of a name going.  I work towards completing things - idgaf about my characters appearance (to the point where multiple people have told me my characters are ugly).
---
I’m all about what can I do to complete X or work towards it on a given day.
---
Going after those expensive things doesn’t necessarily have to be fashion driven.  I want them too, just to say “I completed that”
---
Here we go again with another blanket generalization about everyone being an epileptic seizure. No that’s just you selectively remembering those instances and making you think it happens more than it actually does. Infusions are very expensive and glowy things too. Only a small percentage of players have them and even a smaller fraction of actual fashion wars players would do that. Most of us plan carefully themes and tastefully add some glow to compliment a look. You also see them more because they have reached end wealth so more likely to sit in hubs all day and chatting.  The majority of people are busy grinding in Tyria and your eyes don’t see them when there’s a glowy player beside. Please try to be more unbiased because the reddit hate train is already pretty quick to jump and attack ANYTHING that has any effects or animation.
---
Amazing picture. Prismacolors on canvas?
---
Wait we use a firebrand tank on almost every encounter.
---
The first icon is an internal dev marker for "add this asset as fast as you can".
---
Yep. I blame the \[wings backpack\]([https://i.imgur.com/aMmE6Md.png](https://i.imgur.com/aMmE6Md.png)).
---
The Asuran architectural style in the teleporter puzzle is pretty clear too
---
I still say that one of the smartest things Anet could do was make a top-down isometric GW1-like. Meaning: limited skill selection from a large pool (TCG-like), multiplayer co-op w up to 8 OR use Heroes to solo. Use it to explore parts of Tyria we haven't seen (Depths of Tyria? Orr before the Fall?), put in important story beats from GW1 that GW2 players may have missed, same thing for LS1. It could have been a GREAT little game, esp with that art style. But it sounds like the classic problem of being unfocused &amp; biting off more than they could chew :(
---
Teehee your question is innocently cute. Man! It brings us back to those old MMOs I remember playing MU online and my friend would bring me to high level areas and I afk and level up really fast haha.
---
1. Yes it is but its only really used in high level fractals, raids, and WvW squads. 
---
That being said, aside from speedclear groups I can't really see anyone getting angry at your for running it.
---
2. Yes but it depends on your class.
---
3. Builds on meta battles are min maxed, but as the nature of GW2 min-maxing, it's very easy to play the build of choice without going through the extra effort.
---
4. Burn engi is really funny.
---
5. No massive changes have been made to fo that. However there is the fabled 'alliance' update on the horizon that is seeking to change that. Specifically by changing it from WvWvW, to GvGvG.
---
Hope this helps
---
Dye schemes I can at least hide by setting character model quality to lowest, even if this isn't an ideal solution.
---
There is no hiding auras.
---

---
I ReALLY hope you buy both for $30. It’s so cheap and worth it becasue both were so fun for me. If not pof sale is rarer so focus on that cuz the HoT is always on sale in third party authorized resellers.
---
Huh, mine does.
---
Build templates are already confirmed to be coming in the near future, so they've decided that they've sold enough character slots for people to put elite specializations in. There are still other advantages to buying additional character slots beyond the 9 or 10 many people have.
---
Yes indeed I like those!
---
Thank you :)
---
If you're not trying to look your best then what's the point in playing. Lol
---
I'm glad you could identify what I was literally doing, considering this is literally a bad "joke".
---
Short answer: not on your first character ;) play one to 80 and enjoy the journey, it takes MUCH less time to get a character to max level in gw2 than it takes in other mmos.. use the boost on the next character/class that you want to try out once you hit 80 "manually" once..
---
See the issue is your suggestion just makes an already dead game mode even deader.
---
It's almost like they - who do have these numbers - came to a different conclusions than you - random internet user with as little insight as the rest of us and with a not absurd, but also not very unusual notion.
---
What joke? This is very clearly blocking my progress, as I'm now stuck wondering what other icons/messages/things actually don't do anything.
---
Maybe my HP orb is actually empty. Does my character actually have skills? Am I actually moving or not? Do I have one frog in my bag or 250?
---
Maybe the game doesn't exist at all, and we are all simply imagining it.
---
Honestly you'd miss out on so much if you boosted... The things you stumble across while trying to level is just amazing. If you already have a level 80 and just doing the story it'd be a waste
---
Instead the same old 10 minute story that has no incentive to be played again I'd rather have more actual content like bigger maps and dungeons and world bosses and events and TENGU playable race :c 
---
Also if they're going to add more legendaries then I want armor, no more weapons. 
---
And more dungeons, and then even more dungeons, I don't give a shit about what people think about dungeons, they're fun repeatable content with good rewards and nice level scaling (well atleast back in the day when the game wasn't cluttered with shitty balanced elite specs) 
---
Also can we have tengu already :o
---
There is an alternative. You can get your Raptor without being level 80. All you have to do, is join a player's party as they start the 1st chapter of Path of Fire. As long as you two finish the story chapter together, you'll unlock the Raptor. You'll probably spend the chapter dead during any combat sections, but you can still get the mount.
---
For the Arena, we are going to swap the background depending on phases, the arena is not dynamic enough to warrant a full animation like for Sabir (not done yet) or W6 Qadim. The dynamic part of the arena is extremely difficult to track (which pillar went up, which fragment got destroyed by mines etc) as they are not tracked by arc. For "mechanical stuff" like attack animations, they'll come as we continue polishing W7 fights.
---
This is exactly what I hoped it would be.
---
You want a mount, ask for someone to play the first PoF mission with you. It hands you the Raptor and they can then beat the instance for you as you hang back. Boom.
---
Then, play through, mount included, from Lvl 1 to lvl 80. You miss so much by just skipping all of that, and I could almost guarantee you'd be back tomorrow saying "help, I instantly leveled to 80 and don't know what I'm doing!"
---
Faction warfare in WoW makes sense. The two factions are never truly at peace with each other. The story beats getting from working together to all out war (and fueling it) aren't as strong as they need to be, but it's a natural fit for WoW's setting.
---
One point I'd make is following real world politics you can easily see how groups can slide into conflicts easily over the words and actions of their leaders, with the support of their people. In the real world we have a 24 hour news cycle and immediate access to information, but the proliferation of propoganda and fake news combined with tribalism makes it so politicians can get away with a lot of things they wouldn't get away with if there was trusted, transparent accountability.
---
As players in BfA we have trusted, transparent accountability - we can see everything each leader is doing, we can see the events that lead up to big moments, we can see the events from the other side of the conflict. The average member of the Horde or Alliance don't see those things, so as players we have an unrealistic view of the conflicts and are more critical of story events and their realism. If you wrote the events of world politics over the last few years as a story, people wouldn't believe it.
---
Sometimes stupid, dumb petty shit is the most realistic portrayal of real people.
---
The -ista ending is used for both women and men, btw.
---
&gt; ...we are all simply imagining it.
---
I'm glad I'm not part of "we" then.
---
Would the low level player also need to select the PoF story as their active story content to get credit though?
---
&gt;Why do people think that The Ascension is for any rando player? It's a prestigious achievement for the pro PvP veteran.
---
My sides . . .
---
&gt; Looking at metabattle, builds are quite limited. Is it only for top 1% of min max build or generally harder content forces you to play a certain way
---
Most players visit this site *because* they want to min max.
---
i have 6 builds on my warrior. imagin chrono players.
---
Amazing!!
---
&gt; It's a prestigious achievement for the pro PvP veteran.
---
In 2019? I hope you are kidding o.O
---
Also: you do have to play untill you are a certain PvP level (20?) in order to paly ranked. If you get mixed with really really new players this also tends to mean that you are ranked quite low, so maybe: get better?
---
If you want something with a higher hurdle to get in: play in automated tournaments. You have create a team, so you wont be mixed in with randoms, and for the monthly tournament people need to collect qualification points in the daily ones. 
---
Also maybe change the title of the thread to "My ideas on how to kill the PvP scene for good".
---
That is probably the most unique key binding I've ever seen, the idea of using the same finger for strafe left and right is pretty neat.
---
i have a toon called new player and has the most basic skins.  worn chainmail and all that. basic greatsword and basic axe and bow. no backpack and some zenith weapons.
---
What kind of goals?
---
My karma balance is always hovering somewhere around 1 million, but even things I need to but never drop it much, or for long.
---
Usually the biggest drains are when I buy a new character slot and just get them some karma armor to get by while I figure out where I'm going with them.
---
I don't think you can start select PoF as their active story content without being level 80, so I'm going to assume you don't need to select it. I've personally never done this "mount-sharing" run but I've heard of lots of people using it before.
---
&gt; Sometimes stupid, dumb petty shit is the most realistic portrayal of real people.
---
Emulating Real Life is perhaps the worst fantasy writing out there.
---
I understand how it got there, but it doesn't mean that it logic needs to be abandoned in order to incite violence and conflict. You can just write better.
---
Power necro is what you want for large scale wvw. Should be all berserkers with maybe a couple cav trinkets if you're new to the class.
---
Grieving scourge is the old meta. Scrappers are too prevalent nowadays. You'll be lucky if your condis tick once if at all.
---
Interesting, just tried it and yeah you're right you can't select PoF story unless level 80, I guess going through the instance is enough to buy it then as long as you have PoF.
---
Tengu/Kodan and Ogres are the races i want to be playable, their models aren't so dissimilar that it would be a nightmare to port over armour and such and they all have such interesting cultures
---
As with most people, I would say experience the leveling to 80 without the boost first. That being said, I understand what it's like to be experienced in MMOs and not want to do the leveling grind and just get to the end game. I will also say that this game is a lot different! If you really must boost, do it and then check out heart of thorns if you bought it. Prepare to get your ass kicked, and then I hope you have an alt in waiting that you're willing to relearn the game with. I understand wanting a mount early on, a lot of people are saying to do the first path of fire story to get the raptor before 80, but to those people, don't you have to be 80 for a raptor? Isn't it a mastery?
---
if I'm wrong and you can get the raptor before 80 then I think that's your best compromise.
---
&gt; having all your eggs in one basket is a risky proposition
---
The problem here is they took those eggs and started throwing them against a wall.
---
I love you.
---
I liked the change to Pact Marshall just because his prior role in the story sucked (hanger on to the Queen) but I would have prefered a return to who he was before he made his identity about the Queen and trying to be his brother. Stripping him of the mantle he wore to fill his boots and serve the Queen and then finding his own path that isn't about Jennah or Dylan.
---
A combination of his loss of faith in the human gods (his conversation in Dragonfall) and his loss of dedication to Kryta could have been a really interesting way for him to transition away from being a guardian into something more like a warrior. He's not really acting like a Pact Marshall atm, he may as well be a member of Dragon's Watch for all the leading of the Pact we see him do.
---
I really wish they would figure out a coherent story for characters like Logan that makes sense with who he is instead of playing musical chairs.
---
The customer base is very different too, both might be games, but their markets have nothing to do with each other.
---
have you gotten all of the karma skins unlocked yet?
---
&gt; Without a future title people will leave.
---
Without anything to do now, people won't even be there to leave in the future.
---
I really wanted a map that connected the door just outside Ebonhawke to the Desert Highlands.
---
Karma skins and obsidian drains it man.
---
[deleted]
---
Now that's quality artwork. Very immersive, fits the GW2 aesthetic perfectly.
---
I'm sorry, but that looks EXACTLY as bad as I would expect. I can only shudder at what sort of cutesy child's picture book style they would have drawn the characters in to fit that world.
---
Not dead on YB either.
---
Return to Cantha or bust.
---
Only I n that there is absolutely nothing to be done about it at all, I’m willing to put up with it. 
---
My ultimate desire is to be able to put individual eye-offending players on an aura block list so they appear visually quiet.  This way I can continue to see the people who put more care into their visual shinies.  
---
But back in the land of reality, accepting because I have no choice.
---
I use Longbow a lot for ranging during PvE shenanigans. Just really enjoy the thematic and the sounds it makes (can't fucking stand scepter audio on auto attack). This post speaks to me pretty deeply. I definitely agree with and would support most of your suggestions going through to release. My own thoughts on the matter of shaking up the LB:
---
True Shot just... doesn't need to root you during its wind-up if it's gunna hit like a noodle. Honestly, there's no reason for it. Nothing would be negatively impacted in any way if you could just keep following something while firing it. At least they buffed the range on this skill to make following targets with it less cumbersome. Buff the damage or take off the shackles.
---
I get the Deflecting Shot is thematic with guardians and "blocking often" and whatnot but I'd honestly just throw it out for a completely different skill altogether. But maybe it'd feel better if they just made it a big cone and you didn't have to be so precise with it, but I rather like the skill shot part of it. 
---
But, again, it hits like a wet noodle, and that's the main issue overall with the weapon. I don't mind it having a bit of utility focus on a skill or two, but I think pinning people down with the 5 is enough.
---
I'd much prefer the third skill slot being taken up by something along the lines of scepter 3 or focus 4 emulated or riffed upon in some interesting way. That might sound unimaginative to some but I'd take that in a heartbeat over the practically undamaging and basically useless deflection mechanic we currently have.
---
Let the elite spec's dedicated weapon deal some competitive DPS. Make it comparably as good as scepter / focus. That is in no way whatsoever asking for too much.
---
Okay, but it turns out that in order to survive the Tengu of Cantha have evolved into penguin-themed creatures and only live underwater. They inhabit the Jade Sea and like to ride on the backs of Siege Turtles.
---
Definetly want more charr content, want to see the Blood and Ash citadels one day. We're long past due a charr/ascalonian map.
---
*Teleports Behind You* Nothing Personal, Kid.
---
Haven't heard anything yet. I'd just cut my losses at this point.
---
Bad bot, no apple cider for you.
---
How well does this compare against d912pxy?
---
How does this differ from the  d912pxy?
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy
---
Very untrue. Power Necros work in small burst/range bombs. But Grieving Necros will work best in a melee situation that you sit on top of a group. Torment is still the consistent #1 damage dealer in 90% of my fights. While still doing plenty of power damage just as much power damage as a Marauder build would do. Torment only needs to tick once for it to be worth the application since 2x damage while moving. The reapplication is so consistent plus constant strips with Axe, Scepter, Spite you will eventually out do the Scrapper. 
---
Most guilds run a more pirate ship comp so they use power builds. Stealth, pull, bomb repeat. Once the power Necro uses his wells and F5 he drops off a ton. Which is the exact spot the Grieving/Cele Necro will continue to shine.
---
4000? Oof, you could literally get better ping on the moon.
---
Hey dawg, I train different bosses every Tueday as part of my twitch stream.  I just trained w7 and got a bunch of people their first kills on two bosses.
---
Just because there is not a training group advertised the second you log in and click on the LFG, doesn't mean they don't happen.
---
Thank you, that is excellent news. I just tried it, and it seems to work :) Although I just extracted the whole d9vk runtime and configured lutris to use this. No need for chainload apparently?
---
This fixes one of my three biggest gripes while testing out GW2 on Linux in the last few weeks. The other things that remain is no Yolomouse and that the cursor does not disappear while rightclicking-to-turn-camera.
---
Do you think “hardcore” represents whether there is a natural progression of skill requirement or does it address the time requirements? (Or something else?)
---
It does matter in CM Mode if you get hit by the AoE's you will start dropping a lava just keep that in mind :)
---
Do all those builds use completely different gear? 
---
Because with templates you'd be able to load different builds with the same gear anyways.

Loadouts would be for different gear sets.
---
They listed MOBAs like DotA and LoL, battle royales like PUBG and FPS like OW.
---
Tagging u/AcaciaCelestina too I guess
---
You could always do what I did: level the profession AND buy the lamp.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I'd love to see the Woodland Cascades. I'd imagine we'd get a lot more of that Lost Domain of Melandru feel up in those woods, but with less Branded mayhem, disrupted cliffs, and fallen Charr copters littering the scenery. Maybe have some "burning forest" aspects, but with more magic flames and less destructive-looking.
---
Someone answered me with he very same image when I said they should make upgrades salvageable.
---
So it's just a fancy "/s".
---
This is the first seeing this. You have any tutorials regarding installation and such?
---
Its not just your point that challenging was a part of Anets plan from the beginning. In fact, having challenging content that not everyone could complete in GW1 was a point of pride for Anet and they absolutely wanted to have content in GW2 that was so hard that only the best could complete it.
---
Sadly they weren't able to deliver on the challenging part with vanilla due to multiple points like not having enough time to balance and playtest the dungeons and having no idea on how the combat system would play out. They weren't just unable to deliver on challenging content at release but were fumbling on it until HoT came with raids. It got to the point that people could, even today, say that GW2 has nothing to do with challenging content and that there shouldn't be any challenge there, which I find weird.
---
I agree to all your points but I want to add to the second point that even the raids are not able to fully use the combat system right now due to some system we have. ( Like the 5 man boon limit thats still around for quite a few skills or the fact that boon distribution only has a small range)
---
I was speaking about the past few months, since I haven't played before that. 
---
but yes, I admit I haven't bothered with ultimate so far and already pretty much stopped playing FFXIV again. 
---
most of the content they put out regularly is dungeons, trials, raids &amp; to a lesser degree alliance raids, and all of these can either be run unsynced or the sync level is so high it trivializes the content as soon as you can gear yourself. which happens either by beating it weekly when it's new, or a few weeks later when the next dungeon comes out just farm that for even better gear. so their main progression system is balancing stuff in a way that makes it hard to complete at release but trivial later on. 
---
this is why I can only repeat: try raid progression in gw2 with shitty gear and only upgrade tier by tier once a week and come back and tell me how easy gw2 raids are. 
---
as for this statement, I don't even know where to begin:
---
&gt;And nothing in GW2 matches to a 20 minute fight where at many points one failure by one person means the raid wipes 
---
dhuum greens, handkiter and blacks on deimos usually mean a wipe, failure to feedback matthias (i.e. FB dies), shields at CA, there are tons of situations where a single person can cause a wipe. yes, gw2 fights are a bit shorter, that's it.
---
Language evolves with usage, deal with it.
---
&gt;Those KPs show a certain level of experience and overall raiding knowledge, I’ll grant you that, 
---
&gt;but are honestly completely meaningless when it comes to new content.
---
This is a bit of a contradiction. I can guarantee pugs with 100 Dhuum KP are on average better than those without.
---
You might not like it, but you can't deny that it works - you should be able to understand why people do it. There are a lot of different experiences people are looking for when raiding, and they're all okay!
---
Yeah really odd that on some of my characters the Bitterfrost/Ember Bay trinkets were reset but on others they weren't.
---
Killing giant dragons is kinda fun too.
---
So wait your saying underwater mount? 
---
I’m in!
---
There’s a slight difference between being familiar with a game type and a life risking job that less than 0.001% of the world population are practicing.
---
Nothing that we got to see in GW1. Some place new that adds to the world and overall body of lore instead of just updating it to be current. More racial splinter groups like the Olmakhan.
---
The complete reintegration of the remnants of Flame Legion, or the creation or discovery of an entirely new, sophisticated Legion focusing on the use and practice of [magic.](#s" Some of that new era magic we just heard about.") The reunification of the charr under a single Khan-Ur, with magic users integrated in as a full-fledged quarter of their society once more.
---
Ehh if it’s Kuunavang then we make an exception
---
It only works if the mission you play together is the same story mission you need to do, in the beginning there are more choices which results in more possible missions but later it gets easier
---
i just want the ghostly shield damnit!
---
i remember farming them
---
scarab shield, ochovald shields. we really need some canthan skins
---
while this may be a bit annoying if someone is suddenly a bit higher, you can always go back to lower level maps when you play in those with higher level without "wasting" exp. you will always get the amount tailored to your level, so it doesn't matter that much if you are playing as level 60 for example on a level 10 map.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/agy5ft/what_should_i_spend_my_karma_on/
---
Agreed. They have the best support of any non pay per month MMO I've ever played.
---
&gt;   \[Are\] builds are quite limited \[because\] ... generally harder content forces you to play a certain way? 
---
From what I've seen this is correct. From a lot of those builds there is room for changing a few things, as the notes suggest, but as it is, the hardest PvE content forces players to work as a coordinated group of either 5 or 10 players. As such, the builds need to be tailored in a way that helps fill out the party's roles, and maximize their effectiveness. For open world play, however, the build is not as important as long as the equipment stats synergize with what the build is trying to accomplish, while not being useless in the damage department.
---
I could see them implementing the rifts to guide us to hidden locations that can't be accessed with other mounts, since each volatile magic node refreshes the flight bar.
---
Cantha, Isles of Janthir, or Woodland Cascades/Blood Legion Homelands. I \*really\* would like Cantha though.
---
I'm gonna do you a solid, these are chatcodes for the starting areas of all races. All new characters have them unlocked and you can find them on your own looking at the map, but here they are for your convenience.
---
Copy and paste them in the game chat. Then click on them again to see where its located. The map will open with its location, and you can then click on the waypoint to travel to it.
---
Norn [&amp;BHQBAAA=]
---
Charr [&amp;BIABAAA=]
---
Human [&amp;BO8AAAA=]
---
Silvary[&amp;BDQBAAA=]
---
Asura [&amp;BEAAAAA=]
---
So yea, you can go to Norn starting area and meet your brother from level 1. Or he can go to your starting area. Or you both could go to another race starting area. Do what you'd like, have fun.
---
The finish repair on Magdaers sister sword for the new owner - Logan.
---
it was sent off to be repaired but nothing ever finished. cleansing of Ascalon and movement into the new territory by a new establishment of human and charr, ran by both as a brotherhood and then a new legion formed of an alliance of a majority of the two. During this phase some kind of new villain comes along and logan gets some kind of weird new profession. we go to a new area that is unlocked, Aerial combat is allowed and mount combat in the new area only (first testing)
---
we start seeing new branches of elite specs but arent able to play them until the next expansion: Return of Menzies
---
Gibe adena plox

Talk about not knowing your genre
---
Ahh, there's the type of snarky and unpleasant response I've come to expect from the internet in general/reddit in particular... ;) I would have been downright disappointed and disoriented if someone hadn't sniped at me, so thanks!
---
Beautiful coloring, what medium did you use? It's hard to tell whether it's digital or painted canvas.
---
Yeah same here, 17 characters isn't enough! Maybe I'll stop at 20? (I probably won't stop at 20...)
---
Did you watch the video? It’s not about holding the buttons. It’s about holding and dragging your mouse to change the amount. Watch it again.
---
But if they sold everything on the cash shop for a penny each sales would skyrocket, and that's all profit baby!!!
---
Really? I see them *everywhere*
---
I applaud you, you are a far more patient person than I. Heck I never even considered waiting for the limit to increase in combination with the bulk purchase savings.
---
IMO, this would be extremely boring. A random, not too powerful badguy gives me no reason at all to be interested in defeating them, and so many factors that could obliterate them in an instant would need to be completely ignored, written out of the story or conveniently forgotten that it'd just feel extremely forced.
---
I get that, some pugs are super bad and some just want to leach as someone that usually does t4 and cm's daily Im well aware of this. Tbh as someone else mentioned a decent compromise to let newer people in is to add tiers to raids like fractals and also maybe imo have a raiding commander tag that lets anyone in a raid squad be a commander but I dunno about the last part. Im just rambling I agree with you why it exists and why people use it but theres got to be a better way for people that just want to casually raid and dont have the friends.
---
Yay, another elitist. Guess what? If you ended up in a team with this player, chances are your rank sucks, so hush and git gud.
---
You‘re not entitled to win. You‘re not entitled to being paird up with high elo players. This game mode is for everyone. People like you tend to ruin it for new players that could potentially become main pvp players. No wonder people are freaking put about pvp and wvw „dying out“.
---
True, I bought a character slot last march just so I had one open in case I wanted to make a new character. More frequent sales would probably have made me decide against that.
---
Oh, that guy was joking about GW2's system being better than other MMOS like WoW.
---
So I mentioned that in those games, getting better gear gets you new skins---and that getting better gear is just something that *happens* as you play the game (I.e. do the content you want to and it'll give you the gear you need for it... generally speaking)
---
Skritt expansion, duh.
---
You don't even need to hold left click tho.
---
Literally not literally
---
Trust me, play the game til 80 at least on your first character. Then use your boosts to make alts.
---
&gt; Torment is still the consistent #1 damage dealer in 90% of my fights. 
---
This just means that your damage placement/skill useage is subpar.
---
Grieving is fine against pugmanders or other unorganized groups but try bringing your grieving scourges against Wavy or KEK or DIE or ok and watch how your bomb is nearly nonexistant.
---
I think this is to show that raids are losing popularity.  Could be why they've only been doing new ones every 9 months.
---
the big problem for people like me is I guess, were interested in raids but we A) dont have the friends to make a static B) raid guilds usually ask us to play classes we arent fans of. in my experience anyway, Im a thief main and every time I mention I have an alt for every other class Id get asked to be chrono or something like that. yeah I get it but Im a damn good thief in pve most the time and getting hammered into a class Im not okay with has been a quick way for me to leave guilds C) I really do want to do raids I want to experience the content I want to see the story but Im also hesitant to lock myself to them. I hesitate to join a group play a class they demand of me and have to do it every week, and I dont have that many friends playing gw2 anymore most have either gone to FF14 which I cant stand or are two low on experience and gear to raid. but anyway those are my ramblings on it I for the most part gave up on ever really doing raids as I have a large amount of difficulty breaking out of my shell meeting new people and I enjoy playing a class that people love to shit on(seriously once got kicked instantly accompanied by "LOL thief, no"). I do thank you for the help tho duder I appreciate it and maybe I'll look at training community's again.
---
I believe that those who had the maximum amount and bought an expansion with an extra slot were allowed to have an extra.
---
Is there a way to know that its running? I think Iwas able to chainload it with GW2 radial by renaming it to 'd3d9\_mchain.dll' but I'd like to know for sure other than renaming it back and comparing the FPS.
---
Thank you for sharing this! Everyone complaining this is old news should have cashed in showcasing this and telling everyone, because clearly plenty of us didn't know this. I love learning these little things even after playing for a few years.
---
Well, it's technically in a combat role in All or Nothing and War Eternal, so I wouldn't say he'll not be in a combat role.
---
Which is humorously typically consistently inconsistent for ArenaNet, since in S3 it was stated the Pact Marshal's role will be a desk job in LA. Granted, I'm glad that they have kept Logan on the front lines, at least for Kralk, given the personal history DE has with Kralkatorrik.
---
We have come a full circle.
---
Seriously though, would be a cool occurrence if there was a game where fashion would cycle like it does in real life.  I don't think it does in guild wars, everybody is just wearing the newest and shiniest items and there is little time to appreciate anything but.
---
You visit it during the story. It even has [a POI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leyfinder_Research_Facility)
---
It is south of the big structure. The entrance is at the water level.
---
There's a story instance in the episode, that also contained Sandswept Isles, where you gotta ride ley lines to reach some buttons, that are otherwise inaccessible. I'm not sure which story step this was, but I'm pretty sure that this is what you're referring to.
---
Totally.  It's quite interesting to wonder what the mobile game could have been and if it could've had bonuses for the main game. 
---
I also wonder what kind of system they would come up with for mobile.  Anet is a pretty unique company.
---
both, make a plot point about the strain of having to manage both problems. possibly even make it a choice between who to help with consequences?
---
OMG that's it! I dunno how I didn't see it! I guess I just saw the top part and didn't realize there was an entrance near the water level. Thank you so much! \^\^
---
End game gives you millions of karma anyway, so there's no real need to save it. Though there's not much else to do with karma, so you might just hoard it anyway.
---
Obsidian shards, use said shards to make legendaries. Sell said legendaries. Boom. Karma to gold
---
Cool. Gonna try this out in pve.
---
cantha or uninstall
---
Even if it did give one than one volatile magic pr orb, you still wouldn't be able to farm it more than usual, as they are included in the global amount you can get each day. After the limit, the orbs still spawn but don't give anything but flight juice.
---
If use set enviorment variable 'DXVK_HUD' to 'fps' and you get fps on top left, than its working :)
---
Yes, the leveling in this game is painfully boring and the only things worth doing are raids and dungeons at max level
---
You are quite welcome dearest "Let me tell you all what the smartest thing &lt;foo&gt; could do is"-threat starter =)
---
Screw those people honestly.  There are so many threads hanging out there.  The magical heal everything pool,  how is that gonna be used.  Zojja is still out of action.  Hey what about Livia?  What is she upto.  Marjory is MIA iirc, I dont remember seeing her in and around Dragon Fall.
---
So much plot, so much goodness to be had.
---
There were a lot of people that played tons of other MMOs but were lost in GW2 and complained after using the boost that they have no idea what to do. The game gradually opens up with leveling your first character and you get to know what you can do and what it has to offer.
---
That's what I call laziness.
---
Always happy to hear these things, extra happy that one of our Newbies was helpful to you (they aren't even listed on the Wiki yet, because they are still gearing up).
---
Hope you'll have fun!
---
sucks, i was hoping to revamp all of my character's builds after the reset but i only had like 4 rings out of like 10 fully geared characters with multiple sets actually reset. absolute pure randomness.
---

While I dont have any problems myself I still found it weird most items on my Necro (main) got reset despite me having crafted all of it years ago. None of my alts had anything reset and those alts have nothing but stat selectable gear.
---
Agreed.
---
Great video. The only comment I have is that I'm pretty sure the starting point for the orbs isn't random. Once we had the tank stay in a particular 3rd of the arena consistently, we always had the same starting orb. I'm not 100% sure exactly what it is based on though.
---
bleh
---
It took me until *just now* to realize that the last phase platform pattern is a spiral.
---
yeah 90% pop will leave cuz most of us will troll with perma stealth deadeye /rev/mesmer
---
ROFL that's absolutely hilarious. Was this ranked? What tier? Was that a fake dT?
---
I need core Tyria is mastery points. I’ve done all insights, story, and easy fractal ones. Is buying LS2 episodes a good way to make more points available? Is there a particular episode(s) that are more worth the gems, or should I just get them all in a bundle? Besides karma exterminator, the spoon collection, and TT, what are some easier mastery points to obtain?
---
Was only an unraked game. Not sure if it's the real Discretize or not...
---
Emulating real life is the whole point of fantasy writing, because the audience is real humans and not fantasy creatures.
---
The whole point of fantasy writing is to shed light on some realities with fantastic elements added in so we can look at it from an outsider's perspective, without biases. It's also why just about every fantasy book ever written contains at least some politics, human minds just work that way.
---
Learnt?
---
From what I've seen and tried, Yolomouse isn't gonna work on Linux - the dev himself said he has no idea how he would implement a Linux version as what it does is a very Windows specific "hack".
---
The best solution I've been able to come up with so far is to enable KDE's "show effects on cursor when pressing keybind" desktop effect so I can quickly relocate the cursor.
---
Makes me sad. No Yolomouse and having to alt tab to move my cursor across to my 2nd monitor, and then having alt held down in the game until I press it again gets quite annoying some days. But overall very worth it, because Linux duh.
---
And on the forums you'd be the one banned for naming/shaming/witch-hunting.
---
Yep, I hear you. I agree in most ways - I personally play with a little of each goal in mind. I firstly prioritize maxing out my character, then make them look awesome, while completing all of the goals in the game which I think are interesting.
---
On the other hand, as much as I live gw2, I think the “fashion wars” statement is also a criticism. I like it, but I hate it also. I wish, personally, that was a more meaningful horizontal progression system. The Masteries are okay, but they add no real customization to your character (something I love to do) and are so easily attained that they aren’t much of a long term goal. If there is to be no gear grind, then there needs to be something else. 
---
Ascended and legendaries have kept us going many years, but I personally feel there needs to be some new reward systems added to keep the game attractive in the years to come.
---
Why would I waste my time on manually editing a video of a hacker? This video was recorded with shadowplay, and later trimmed. I can upload the full video if you want...
---
Yeah, it feels like even the most obvious hackers don't get banned
---
Good to know :D
---
Yeah that's a downside to it, I wish they had a no helmet option sometimes. I still enjoy the whole aesthetic of some.
---
I started putting all sellers on my blocklist. Takes some time and there are new ones from time to time but much  more convenient
---
I encountered this one in particular before, and have seen hackers in all game modes before: I don't know if it is because the game is not supposed to render that speed, or if it is actually a series of teleport and not a hyperspeed run, but that is what "speedhacking" looks like.
---
&gt; a buddy of his  
---
Something about "Banlist"?
---
Doesn't really work when you play with half of them.
---
Boost to lvl 80 and do high level stuff. The story and low level stuff suck. Necro is pretty hot become a reaper.
---
I think there's a separate sub for both character looks and cosplays , so that the posts don't completely clog up the sub.
---
[Yes](https://www.lexico.com/en/grammar/learnt-vs-learned)
---
I know it's fallen behind firebrigade in the meta, but I love playing boon chrono in fractals. It's really versatile with tons of utility and benefits a lot from knowing the encounters (and nothing is more satisfying than reflecting Arkk's stupid orbs right back in his face)
---
I mean if Anet gave me 5-8 dps golems every 4-5 months I'd be a little let down. You're right, I couldn't care less about the models or the art, but the encounter does have to be fun. Just releasing extremely bad raids doesn't keep the community occupied. So I agree with your second point, but you're just wrong on the idea that the raid doesn't have to be fun. W7 was so well received *because* the encounters were fun, especially the first 2 (qadim2 is kind of a snoozefest).
---
Never mind all that, your point isn't even related to the discussion we were having about the quality of W7.
---
Wow I thought this were behind us. Used to get this kind of hack way back then. Shame really. Time to take out my dusty pitchforks and torches
---
The devs have blatantly said they regret how it has turned out , but that it's too late to reverse it.
---
Then how does one get legendary armor from pve .\_.
---
Because anet hate Charr
---
Give that one a pat-pat.
---
Well yes but you're saying that its marketing is good because of that. I would say users of mmorpg.com are rating the game and nothing to do with marketing hype, thus it says nothing about their marketing.
---
I think their marketing is poor, like with many other things anet tries to do marketing differently because they think they know better, they don't.
---
Starting at 20% or so, Qadim was gaining booms at an alarming rate. My group was under the impression that he was stealing boons (or maybe our supports were just dropping the ball). Do you know what the deal with that is?
---
Also, I noticed that you forgot to go over the arrow attack. In any case, it was a great video. Despite already having a kill, I definitely feel like I learned a thing or two!
---
Depends on the armor weight. I still haven't found a great light or medium. But the cultural heavies look good, and the revenant mist set looks amazing on charr. Warbeast armor looks really good on them too.  There are also a few outfits that look actually better on charr , like Fallen Balthazar , Mist Stranger , Sentinel , and a few others.
---
Their social media is preaching to the converted not marketing the game to increase players or to bring players back.
---
There are a lot of gamers who don't even realise GW2 is still alive, there are many  of them on other general gaming sub reddits.
---
Well... since we have forums and we post, at least it's less spammy. But the "ladder" thing has also gotten completely ridiculous.
---
just gonna add this is probably a Mirage build for WvW
---
It's easier to model headwear without hair.  The Top Hat, Wizard's hat, Witch's hat and many more take away hair too.  That way ANET only has to model one hat for each race instead of one hat for each hairstyle they race has.  
---
At least the Swaggering Hat gives a new hairstyle when equipped, but it's the only one I now of that does this.
---
&gt; The grawl are native to Tyria, and Ascalon in particular. The earliest mention of them is found in early charr military tributes that predate the arrival of humans in the area. In these annals, the charr are always portrayed as victors with the defeated grawl pulling the charr commanders in great chariots. The charr dominated the grawl, forcing them into the Shiverpeak and Blazeridge Mountains and beyond, where they lived at a subsistence level. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Planet_of_the_Grawl
---
In regards to dwarven, never explicitly stated but heavily inferred in Edge of Destiny with an ancient dwarven town found under southern Ascalon, and in GW1 with [Kathandrax Steelsoul](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kathandrax_Steelsoul), a dwarf who fought the charr being buried in lands conquered by charr before humanity arrived.
---
The original charr homelands lie east of the Blazeridge - same general area that the Blood Citadel (capital for the Blood Legion) lies.
---
but thats just copypaste of sand jackal portal that ports high up into sand-path.
---
i would just make a different mastery like a passive boost of something - more hp for mounts, more toughness. same like other mounts have their specific passive ability and then last mastery "that ability shares across every other mount", like jackal dodging
---
While that is a possibility, I don't see thinks as pessimistically. I'm sure Anet has seen the shit storms hitting other gaming companies and their mobile versions (Nintendo, Blizzard, Bethesda, etc.) and lootbox controversies, so I assume they will make smarter moves.
---
Wait, are you serious? Omg I'm so dumb, I swear I tried to turn off helmet on the Equipment tab, I'll check again today , lmao thanks for the "heads up"
---
Yup - I'm trying to up my "farm game" and actually track how much gold I am earning (and maybe start selling my hoarded materials) so that by August, I can buy the bank tabs/character slots I want for no good reason. 
---
The way this game works, I don't even want to delete my unused character because they are like on their 3rd birthday (mains are on 6th) and serve as decent mules.   
---
I certainly wouldn't be planning to 'panic buy' this stuff in the future if I knew sales happened more often. (The gemstore cosmetics itch is starting to hit me now too so if I farm too well, maybe I'll buy skins/outfits for the first time too since they rotate unpredictably-- sigh)
---
Thought that was season 3?  Chapter 4 or 5.
---
What if true strike did all those things, but was moved to the 5 slot and got a 1 minute+ cooldown. Basicly making it an ult and the dragon slaughtering attack it always wanted to be
---
if you've already bought all the games and expansions, you probably have one slot for every character type there is.  So what's the point?
---
How its not in Lions Arch, its in Hoelbrak no where near LA. Its being brought back as far as we know because of Kralkys death. Its got nothing to do with old LA minus the moa racing.
---
&gt; Which is humorously typically consistently inconsistent for ArenaNet, since in S3 it was stated the Pact Marshal's role will be a desk job in LA.
---
At this point there were no threatened from a dragon. And while the whole PoF story, he *do* had his desk job. We heared from him again in Long live the Lich. 
---
And when we fought directly against a threat, the Marshall aka Trahearne were always on the front, fighting witht he pact. There is no inconsistents, he does what Trahearne did before, leading the pact.
---
I said on the forums, not here.
---
Where can this hair be obtained? If at all?
---
Yea, I feel you.   
---
I was hoping for an "event" that would push the story forward, globally. Like the destruction of Lion's Arch. Going back and trying to squeeze in Tengu lore alongside the already completed vanilla story probably wouldn't have worked **but** if we started the next races story \*\*after\*\* the defeat of Balthazar or Kalk/etc -- then their story could be woven in naturally.   
---
More Tengus appearing in the world, assisting, etc -- being referred to as something other than "Commander" but quickly earning the respect of the other NPCs and being involved with future guilds/etc.   
---
I think at this point though, something like that will probably only happen in Guild Wars 3.
---
Genuinely curious, how does this even work?
---
I never knew these icons were on banners in the first place.
---
Nope. There was a response on the forum thread saying that a hotfix was applied, but I have yet to see anyone say that it helped them, and many questions from people who didn't get it fixed.
---
It’s a shame how lazy assnet it.
---
I know.
---
To add to this:  some speedhacks allow players to run around a mile off the ground where no one can target them.  On everyone else's client, they appear to be constantly falling out of sky and "porting" back up over and over.  It's just how hacked movement renders.
---
Unrelated to Zhitan, but a trans ex-Svanir is a super cool concept. Shame she was deleted :(
---
The inconsistency is this:
---
General Almorra Soulkeeper: Certain Pact elements feel like Marshal Trahearne's mistake was going out into the field and getting himself killed.
---
General Almorra Soulkeeper: The new marshal would be planted safely in an office in Lion's Arch. Still leading the troops, but out of harm's way.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Research_in_Rata_Novus
---
Yeah, Logan is doing what Trahearne did. And because that got Trahearne killed, influential people pressed for his successor (Logan) to do **only** a desk job.

That happens to me all the time though. I can't tell you how many times I said I'm never doing something again, only to do it. The longer he's away from the blighting pod, the more chance he has to recover. There were things after my back surgery I said I was never going to do again that I do now.  Sometimes time is what it takes.

In books and movies and literature, people change all the time, or those formats wouldn't be interesting. And considering Logan's specific history with Kralky...I mean that's really the story of Destiny's Edge's implosion after all...I don't see him sitting by the sidelines no matter what.

# SPOILERS BELOW! GO AWAY IF YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT UP!

&gt; In season three we got the plot twist that killing dragons is actually bad for the environment, so we decided to put the ice dragon Jormag and the fire dragon Primordus to sleep by having their magical energies cancel each other out.  
---
I mean, no, that wasn't what happened. We (specifically Taimi) was attempting to figure out how to channel Jormag's energies into Primordus (and vice versa) to *kill* them. We really don't figure out fully that killing more elder dragons is definitely a problem until PoF. The Fire and Ice dragons going to sleep was a result of the backfire from Balth attempting to absorb their energies. 
---
&gt; Assuming we deal with Kralky this season, that leaves only the unnamed ocean dragon, and nobody wants an all-underwater zone.  
---
I mean, firstly, no, that does not leave only one elder dragon. Primordus and Jormag were put to *sleep*, not killed, so they are not definitively out of the picture. We even learn in ep6 that Kralk seems to like going into a semi-dormant stage to heal, so it's possible Balth's meddling really didn't agree with Primordus/Jormag, and they're just recovering.
---
Secondly, speak for yourself about not wanting an underwater zone. Maybe not fully underwater - maybe an Atlantean type "sea city" thing - but the idea of a thalassophobia-inducing Lovecraftian Deep Sea Dragon (which, considering the lack of information, seems  to be the way we're going *anyway*) is pretty darn exciting to me.

&gt; For a game with “*Guild Wars*” on the box, there are surprisingly few guilds warring with one another.  
---
Oh boy, this tired old argument. Yes, we know Charr and Humans are best buds. We know Asura think themselves (rightly) above everyone else. It's *old news*. Unless you can update that idea/content with really cool, new stuff, as PoF did for Elona, it's *not* going to be exciting.
---
&gt; The three orders that make up The Pact started out at odds with each other 
---
Eh... they started out having very different ideas of how to deal with the elder dragons. They were *not* enemies, at least not in the way this article implies.
---
I like the idea of visiting Cantha - I'd *love* to see a GW2 version of the mess that is Kaineng City - but we need a good reason for it. I don't wanna ruin the concept Cantha just because we rush into it because of "nostalgia".

&gt;Logan Thackeray: I could do this all day

because they dont unless you post them on reddit and it gets a lot of upvotes. but even then they only ban the account hack was used on and not the main account of the abuser
---
that's another, though obviously related option
