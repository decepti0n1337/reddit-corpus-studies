Thanks, [getting that fixed](https://github.com/baaron4/GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser/pull/409/files) :)

Honestly, people that have issues with others should just contact support and block them. Messages like these are bound to make the get teased even more.
---
Holosmith is a great all rounder for PvP. But every spec but renegade has meta build.

Elsweyr has less content than 1 living story release lol.
---
I heard the algorithm that sets the server status (full - very high - high - etc) heavily relies on how many people play WvW during a week. I also heard one server (WSR? Not sure) managed to get some people stop playing to lower the status from full to very high and allow some transfers. But again, it was long time ago and probably not heard from reliable source.
---
I love Vaanss for some pvp/wvw footages
---
I love noxxi for his funny content
---
l love wooden potatoes for beeing the news hero we need. 
---

---
Thanks to all of those creators for entertaining me and giving me a good time.
---
 i appreciate y'all
---
I dumped ESO to come back to GW2...and i'm tired of GW2....nothing really out there peaking my interest
---
This is really the ideal way to play gw2. Sometimes I'm super into it and work on side content and achievements for weeks at a time, sometimes I'm just in to knock out my dailies and off in less than 10m for months at a time.
---
Even larger Mmos don't have a super quick story cadence, so I don't expect it to speed up, but gw2 definitely feels designed to let you play other things too.
---
Give some other games a try is my advice, MMO or not.  Playing GW2 isn't your job (I'm assuming), it shouldn't be viewed as a commitment but as something that you do for fun.
---
Check out Grim Dawn -= it's on sale on Steam right now (July 4 sale) - pretty fun...not as crazy on the skill tree like PoE (which I have too)
---
I have! I alt-tab quite a bit, not just in the loading screen. Is there something going on with that, maybe?
---
This needs a photoshoppin' , but here's my upvote.
---
Ugly full infusion ðŸ¤®
---
If you have some Dragonhunters in your raid just put them on orb-duty.
---
They have massive ranged capabilities with Scepter / Focus and their Sword of Justice, it usually should be enough to deal with them really quick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Generally if you know your team needs a gliding phase for the last dps check you just clear all orbs on the way to the windwall and any orbs that are nearby, or those that are going to become a problem--
---
xDDD
---
But seriously having a job is nice
---
Ugly skins ðŸ¤®
---
I have a spare PoF key, let me know if you want it.
---
Shot it in the dark but have you tried running in windowed fullscreen?
---
Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Move on and maybe come back if you feel like it.
---
Also, I don't agree with your WvW summary. In my experience, it's pretty easy to dismount players if needed and find fights at any time. Not saying it is like it once was, but it's still functional and fun.
---
And yet I refuse to play those other MMOs because I don't want that purpose. That feels completely like a red herring to me. I play this game because I can choose my own goals whatever they might be. Collecting everlasting tonics or skins, if I feel like that. Making a legendary if I feel like that. Doing every JP if I feel like that.
---
Honestly, I'd rather be in control of my own goals than have a game feed them to me. It's like inflation. If your salary goes up 3% and inflation goes up 4%, you're not actually more powerful than you were, even though you're seeing higher numbers. Or you're a little more powerful, if it's the other way around. But it's just a gear grind. You're not great...you're a coat rack for greatness. I'm here because that doesn't exist here, and I'll stay here for that reason. If they added that arbitrary required grind to this game, I'd be gone.
---
Same tbh.  There are times when I grind out another legendary fast as can be, or power focus the game because I thought of a goal that I had in mind and had the will to complete... others I won't play for a couple weeks.  Once you hit hours leading in to the thousands it is hard to maintain the same verve. 
---
 I will say that one thing that has helped me from time to time is to find a new player and follow them around/explore with them/help them out as they discover all the great things the game has to offer and that I now take for granted.  It gives a kind of vicarious buzz that reminds me of how I felt the first time I picked up the game, and it feels great (plus it gives that person a really good welcome to the game and sets them up for great experiences later).
---
Are you using the in game screenshot mechanism, Shadowplay, ReLive, Fraps, etc?
---
Adding guilds to a suggestion about monthlies is almost begging for them to ignore your suggestion. We all know how little they care about guilds.
---
I want to use Reshades screenshot function so I'm able to see the reshade preset in the screenshot itself. But that's not working.
---
The ingame screenshot mechanism works but - of course - doesn't display the reshade effects.
---
I only do training runs and the amount of times our runs die made me think of cheapening on my food, So when I do manage to find a really bad group I can at least cheap myself on my food and still be viable when trying to clear the boss, ill wait for cooking 500 and hope for more healing % increase food untill then I will follow your advice
---
This is exactly what I do. I've been playing GW2 for total of 5 years but I take breaks enjoying other games when it becomes repetitive. Good thing about GW2 is that you never need to play catch-up on gear when you come back. Trying out FFXIV now and I'm enjoying it alot (incase you want to scratch that MMO itch).
---
Oh yeah forgot about new wing :)
---
This is really incredible work! I also recently picked up watercolors and everything ended up as brown muddy puddles. Got any tips? 
---
Well done!
---
Just add more time-gates to the items needed for monthlies  ...  
---
Look at how well it worked for skyscale.  The speed-freaks paid, the casual grinders made a fortune.   Win-win.
---
the expansions do add more stress to the game; Heart of Thorns has lots of 3D space (the maps are more platformer like) while Path of Fire has way longer Lines of Sight (maps are larger, open spaces) you'll be able to play the game; but you'll notice some lower frames in the HoT &amp; PoF maps; probably.
---
This isn't a relationship, no one will be disappointed or hurt if you cheat. Try another game my friend and come back when either that one bores you or you get the itch for some more GW2. 
---
I came back just about a month ago, only to find that the raid training discords are pretty much dead, like 4 trainers for the whole discord, one of them is literally dead, and it's pretty much "have a guild or make your own group and hope it fills". So until the scene gets better or I luck out and find a guild, I'll focus on fractals and gold making.
---
My point is, nothing is too important (when it comes to gaming) to not enjoy yourself.
---
Yeah OP there's a lot of us that share the same sentiments. I quit after HoT because I was already getting bored of the game, but the expansion was the nail in the coffin for me after I found out that they were nerfing dungeon rewards to try to get the community to stay away from it. I eventually came back in 2018 around when they released SAB, but it was after playing Blade &amp; Soul for rougly 2 years. I have to say I had more fun gameplay-wise on there than any other MMO ever. I unfortunately felt I had no choice but to quit because of how p2w it became. No matter how fun it was, nothing is worth having to spend real life money in order to guarantee being able to participate in endgame content. Fuck that shit.
---
So yeah, I'm back on here and just trying to play casually but it feels so much different than the game once was. I miss the old fotm, the current iteration is just pure cancer. Dungeons also had a much higher skill ceiling for minmaxing than raids do.
---
Yeah, that works, but that's the long way. 
---
Long because thanks to the weekly cap it's faster to do fractals or even to farm gold and craft your gear. Weekly cap is 150, let's say you get 200 per week thanks to some minis and stuff. A full armor set needs 1300 magnetite shards, so it takes 6,5 -&gt; 7 weeks to get a full armor.
---
I haven't checked lately, I guess it came either with one of the hotfixes or with Dragon Bash.
---
I don't know if the original cap is still there, I didn't had enough LI to check that.
---
In PvP it's not high. People have condi clears. Thing is even if they don't, you'll get cc'ed and comboed. The reason scourge and mirage are basically the 2 condi clases you'll find the most, is because of their sustain. Condi berserker is no good at teamfights/ side nodes
---
First of all i didnt mention 1shot for this build, it was mesmer builds in general. Tons of mirage and chrono running in pvp/wvw with chaotic interruption. Extremely cancer and unfun. Well i got hit by a cc guess ill die. Never liked how easy it us to land damage on others when im on a mirage. Randomly pressed magic bullet, now everyone in aoe is hard cc'd. Amazing.
---
Now dont come back with but its not meta in at's and high level plays. Its cancer and thats enough reason to get that shit removed from game. 
---
Btw i noticed that you are talking about everything other than the video in question to justify your claims. You might want to make your points on the basis of video.
---
These are really lovely! Especially your use of light (:
---
Trigger someone in 5min playtime. WvW is strong  with you ðŸ˜…
---
No offense, but I would say this is a case of facing an opponent who has no idea how holosmith works. The first trait in the standard holo 2 2 1 setup grants the ability to convert 1 condition to a boon on leaving holo state, 2 if above 50% heat. Since the damage of berserker is mostly from comes from burns and bleed , your only stun break being balanced stance, it is simply not possible for a holosmith to lose a match up unless there's a vast difference in skill.
---
Get stupidly cheap food and utility buffs with 10 or 15% xp gain - we're taking a few copper.
---
Stick to power then precision then ferocity as stats while levelling. Power scales better before 80.
---
When you stealth, either on f1 traited, dagger 5 skill or blinding powder etc etc you unlock a different attack on your 1 skill. Dagger 1 for example is a backstab, so for maximum effect you want to flank your opponent - the game never really tells you this that clearly.
---
Traits will help you a lot levelling  - it's easy where you're at at the moment so stick to damage trait lines that improve power.
---
Short bow is your events tag weapon as it hits many targets and widens your xp gain, and for getting around quick
---
These are great! I love the soft colours :)
---
i honestly thought by reading the title of the post that it would be just a picture of a landscape with the punchline being "he is in stealth"
---
i'm not sure whether to feel good about the nice artwork, or bad about the missed joke opportunity
---
Wait, why did I get downvoted?
---
Shit, that's actually a good one.
---
I have the character and the landscape on separate layers, so it wouldn't be impossible at all either.
---
I bought the expansions a year or so ago. I didn't use the free transfer like that long until I suddenly clicked transfer in the morning when I tried to guest. 
---
Was from IoJ and now in Kaineng. That is my home server fir now.
---
for nearly the same reason i logged into ESO yesterday, i have a lvl10 something, dunno what it is. i tried to do the main quest, but ended up following the wrong markers, took me 20 minuted to figure out the map and where i actually was. tried to kill a large bug and died. my inventory is full of junk, i am constantly pulling my weapon and attacking stuff just trying to walk forward. i have no idea how to use my skill bar and i keep typing wwwwwwwwwwww into the chat window. i'd delete the game if i wasnt a huge fan of their previous game and didnt buy all expacs before elsewyre
---
so i am still playing gw2
---
You should consider cycling into another game.  I don't mean in a 'so long sucker' kind of way.  
---
Keep it installed but try a new game.  Maybe try something outside of the norm, like a standalone with a famously great story or even going game free for month to just let that part of yourself refresh.  You can stay in the community, checking the reddit, checking for the next update, checking the new mount skins.  And definitely try some other MMOs, they all have their strengths.  (But so few have dodge...)   
---
I always have other games installed and always a variety pack.  Like Stardew valley, Minecraft, Civ 6, Skyrim, Knight's of the Old Republic 1 &amp; 2 and Assassin's Creed Odyssey.  Choose a game from your collection that has different mechanics.  
---
If you haven't tried it yet try the KotOR games, they are on sale on steam and can run on a potato due to age.  They have an excellent story.
---
I don't get it?
---
Quadim should have a word with Abbadon
---
Happens to almost all new posts here; it's not personal.
---
That's kind of sad. Wonder why people do that.
---
Alternatively, if you don't have the bandwidth to run a 10-hour youtube video, is to open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell and type `ping -t 8.8.8.8` then enter. This will ping Google's DNS non-stop, keeping your connection active all the time.

---
Either you set a new one (legendary armor/trinket, fractal god, stuffing and mastering a new/all characters, ...), or it's ok to do a break until you have an idea.
---
Oh nice!
---
Not sure. I could be wrong about the gap, I just don't remember it. I'll take a closer look next time I do home instance
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
You have to be very patient with watercolours and the kind of paper you are using is very important too. I do use coldpressed, heavyweight (300g/m^2 - 140 lb) watercolour paper. Start with light colours, wait for them to dry and apply darker colours. I do also use a lot of tissues to control the wetness of the brush. All in all try it out, practice and habe fun! :D
---
You have right to say loud your oppinion but making posts loke this expect to be downvoted to the oblivion.
---
Thank you! I appreciate your kind words! :)
---
Thank you &lt;3 I am glad you like them !
---
Thank you Skrool! &lt;3 ^^
---
You can either run more dungeons (for the skins) or start with fractals (high end dungeons so to speak) or try out wvw/pvp (there are quite a number of good builds for core classes without the expansion).
---
Have fun.
---
Berserker can work pretty well. But not always. Only on power. Check out vaanss on youtube, this guy is playing berseker pretty much lately.
---
I enjoyed farming them in a day and getting my reward and not having to worry about them every day. I know its stupid but I HATE dailys, I don't do them, I don't know why but I absolutely hate them.
---
Turn off shadows, turn off reflection, set character limit to low. Runs pretty good for me.
---
My favourite is Forged with Fire -&gt; Wyvern Matriarch -&gt; Pinata. Give it a try.
---
If you wanna play wvw, better level warrior. If you go there with ranger, you will be hated by everyone, kicked out of every squad and shouted about to swap to proper class. Nothing wrong with ranger, its just that class has 0 team support in gamemode where team support and teamplay is everything.
---
Truly gamebreaking.
---
Balance is objectively garbage in PvP. Autoattacks do more damage than entire burst combos at launch. They've completely ruined the combat with careless powercreeping, now it's barely playable and the barrier of entry is so huge that it scares away most new players (because they explode in 2 seconds).
---
Reached level 80 on my first character. Should i invest on leveling up crafting? (im a thief) i have 135 in weaponcrafting. But its getting expensive real fast. I have ores up until orichalcum, same with wood required.
---
Yeah im in the same boat right now, ive known that gw2 will never be the game i want it to be for years but i keep floating in and out mainly because of the excellent combat system and wvw but it will never get better its just downhill from here.
---
Cook and Becker !
---
swtor is really good in core game, i enjoyed the revan storyline but after that where the storyline is written for all classes/sith/republic as one path turned me off, and then the endgame gearing in rng crates made me uninstall
---
I am in exactly the same situiation. I have like 8k pvp matches played, and the meta has been a bit stagnant for a while. I haven't done anything in pve since finishing the last living world story.
---
I have been playing BDO a bit, and am considering giving WOW another go. 
---
I probably need to take a break from GW2. The living world, and festivals aren't really doing it for me as far as fun goes. I will deffinitely come back if an expansion is released or new elite specs.
---
To be fair I think it isn't really the fault of the game, I have just been playing a long time.
---
It's not sunken cost fallacy or burnout.
---
&gt; Wanting to play something
---
That's the key sentence. We want to play something. But everything is old and new content takes ages to be added only to be cleared in an hour at best, maybe two.
---
The pace of content release is just beyond abysmal. The game is great, there's just almost nothing to do and it's only going to get worse because their shitty living story is eating up all the resources.
---
I really enjoyed the ranger, he has Spirits and two low cd 33% protection commands with aoe regen, and aoe swiftness.. I consider that team support? oh well that sucks...
---
I also did the same thing. I extremley lost faith in Anet. Since mid 2018 i think they have no clue what to do with their game.
---
Picked up Ac odyssey and origins and having an absolut blast. I highly recommend them to anyone being bored with gw2 or anets way of developing the game.
---
Just take your gw2 keybinds over to AC and enjoy yourself without having to learn everything all over.
---
In wvw i've just learnt to judge player positions by their overhead triangles. I barely even notice player models anymore it's gotten so bad.
---
I personally think it's important to have regular breaks from any MMO. 
---
I started taking breaks back when Season 1 of Living Story was going on. The good thing is that once you make it a habit, you won't feel bad about missing ANY content. I missed the be-all and end-all boss Twisted Marionette, missed some story content that dropped with reworked Tequatl and Edge of the Mists patches, even now I just came back from another 4-month break, missing my favorite SAB festival and bunch of sweet short events. During this time period I logged in once to do story, but didn't came back to the game fully until 1,5 months later.
---
I don't regret missing anything of it. I trust my fellow GW2 players when they say the Twisted Marionette was the most awesome world-boss in GW2 ever. But at that time I needed a break, and no amount of amazing content could've fixed that. Right now I'm doing Skyscale collection without any hassle, there's WvW mount I'd like to have too, I want to get back to PvP and generally speaking I'm just enjoying the game.
---
Warrior is more used in a party compared to guardian in core classes. Core guardian is also quite strong if you get the right build but warriors wont get shunned. Check metabattle fractals build for both of em. I personally like core warrior as it has a brawler feel to it.
---
I love this, though it's missing some of the 'tavern shanty' feel of the original/official version, which i think really adds to the song.  
---
It also feels like it needs to escalate in rowdyness from one verse to the next? That's the best way i can put it into words
---
watercolors are so versatile, you always have something to discover &lt;3
---
Thx
---
Thought so. Thx.
---
So much this
---
Been there since world 2
---
Divinity Original Sin 2 - thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d recommend for a break. It helped me ;-)
---
well, then I don't have much hope for it to come to game
---
Very bad quality
---
Even if it came, without Josh it wouldn't be the same.
---
SAB is my favorite event in any game and it hurts to see info on W3/W4. If they could make W3/W4 short like W1 it would be so nice. I wish they would trim a lot of W2 and make it more streamlined. 
---
I think SAB has a lot of potential and it would be nice to see it fully realized. They could expand the rewards and monetize a lot more aspects of SAB(Mount Skins, Pass Key, etc).
---
A small tidbit: When Josh Foreman left Anet he got a lot of questions about SAB. He had all the files/info on future zones and all he needed was the green light(basically devote the time) to create them.
---
Why August? That's likely when Four Winds and Queen's Gauntlet will be on. :&gt;
---
Thats the most interesting one ðŸ˜‚
---
I also think w2 is way too long. But this sub adores SAB beyond even GW2 itself. So be careful saying anything negative about it. 
---
I think w1 length is perfect and if they ever do make more worlds (which they might with the festivals team going as far as to remake Dragon Bash), I hope they at least consider the length.
---
Vibrant and beautiful, and a lovely gift. As some others have mentioned, sometimes the scale and majesty of these images can conjure a certain...misplaced expectation, shall we say, for the in-game incarnations. Ebonhawke, the Harathi Hinterlands, even many of the Orrian zones (for me, anyway.)
---
I agree that W2 went a little overkill, specifically with the Ninja mountains. If W3 and W4 are a little less ambitious and lenghty, I won't mind much. It'd just be nice to have them there.
---
No, system and chest is under Krait Obelisk.
---
Same here. With breaks when I get bored though.
---
gw2.dat
---
I can understand. Divinity 2 has a free camera though. Itâ€™s not fixed isometric in that sense.
---
Oh thanks. Didn't notice
---
I've bounced between this and XIV for years and have only recently decided to just keep both installed and focus on the things I like in both games rather than push myself through content I'm not really into just because "this is the game I'm playing right now". So far it's great.
---
I've also found trying some different builds in WvW helps keep it fresh, I rarely run the same class for a week straight and enjoy tweaking things here and there.
---
&gt; The night before I came out to them, I had packed a bag in case it didn't go well and was prepared to live on the streets.
---
Daaamn! I have some friends and acquaintances who were afraid to come out to their family and expected that their parents wouldn't be ok with that, but none of them were in such a position.
---
&gt; so I had to have some understanding from their point of view too.
---
This is very mature of you.
---
Many people are too focused on themselves and how they feel that they don't realise how others might feel. I believe that the fact that it went well with your parents at the end has a lot to do with you being able to see their point of view as well.
---
&gt;  It's better to be open and honest and be surrounded by people who love and accept you for who you are, than to live a life where you constantly have to hide who you are and how you feel.
---
I completely agree. Having to hide who you are takes a toll on you day by day and your life can turn to shit without even realising it in time.
---
At the end of the day what matters is your happiness and well being and you can't have that when you feel oppressed by your surroundings.
---
I hope your brother will accept you too some day. I hope that he can realise that you are still the same person that you have always been regardless of your sexual preference.
---
I actually preferred the first one! Both excellent games, though.
---
Do the rifts properly work by now?
---
Znuu! I'm a big fan of your work! These are incredible, as always \^\^
---
Not a great way for people to try and complete their tequatl or aurene weapon sets.
---
Because back to school is August September
---
It's 47g for the full set. Plus 1300 shards which are ~100g. So your armor is worth ~150g while crafting armor costs around 180g, depending on the materials you already have. It's only 30g difference. 
---
And farming 180g don't take 7 weeks, I mean you already get 100g only from dailies in 7 weeks. 
---
There are much better and easier ways to get ascended gear than waiting 7 weeks. Doing the legendary armor collections for example gives you one free ascended armor set and one almost free set. Also outside of raiding fractals and crafting is way faster/easier to get ascended armors, so I wouldn't call tha magnetite shard way easy. It actually is one of the longest ways.
---
I still don't understand how they abandoned the single most interesting and original piece of content in the game, AND THEN fired the dev responsible for it. It is completely confusing.
---
If I hadn't gotten it the observed drop rate would be closer to the one it actually is. In other words, I got **very** lucky, you or me or anyone else won't get that lucky (any more), at least that is the mindset everyone should have.
---
Once you achieve your goal or you have explored enough, the game gets exposed.
---
It's an action combat MMORPG... except all the instanced group content that's PvE relies on traditional mechanics and in the open world (and the instances) the bosses and even veteran monsters become immune to half the action combat content (they can snare or displace you, you can't displace them). 
---
A living breathing world sounds cool but really... it just locks content if the event(s) have already been completed and for those who no longer have use for the content it becomes tedious to re-do it again for the experience.
---
The game feels stale. I've been on and off since alpha. Recently I've been on and grinding out the mounts. I have just started the Skyscale mount and already I'm losing my drive again.
---
I'm not here to throw shade at people enjoying the game, for sure it can be fun and engaging and motivating if you're working towards something. I just feel it's lost its shine for me years ago and it's kind of a "I'll play a few hours a few months and then I'll be gone for a year".
---
WvW and PvP were the only places I feel like action combat could work because you can actually displace other players with your skills as intended but I don't know enough about either one anymore to comment. They were pretty fun while I played them. WvW moreso than PvP (I felt capturing points was less fun and skilled than GW1 GvG or HoH).
---
Jesus 50k crates and you were lucky to get it? How low is that droprate?! What are you gonna do with the rwst of the stuff? Just sell everything?
---
Mostly yeah, though I was missing around 1k spirit shards which I now got from the champ bags. Will also be needing the mats I get from champ bag gear.
---
ANet has this very weird balance between throwing everything at your head and drowning you in it, while on the other hand sporting droprates making any chinese gacha hell look like a children's playground.
---
Pass key for permanent access or for just another all-included-zone? if it would be a permanent access pass, it would be the second fastest thing I bought on the gemstore. (first fastest will always be the shrine guardian skin)
---
This. When Josh talked about SAB facts on his stream, he said that SAB was one of the least populated festivals to date. From their statistics they saw that only a small part of the playerbase actually cared to revisit each iteration of the event whilst the bigger part just did non SAB stuff. Also not many people bought the endless coin thus making their initial effort to monetize it a bit weak. End of that story is that they pulled Josh off the SAB project. When they reinstated SAB as an annual festival they brought Josh back in as consultant to the Festival Team to teach them how to develop or alter SAB. Josh himself said tho that the current head of the Festival Team (even after the layoffs) is very interested to see SAB continued
---
Have tried multiple things but cannot seem to work. Am level 27 and fairly new. Want to make the Iron Legion armor for when I get to lvl 35 and 50.
---
Ah yeah, my favorite villain. Dragons with absolutely zero personality.
---
Srsly, Zhaitan, Jormag, Primordeus and Kralk (up until 4x6, there they randomly tried to give him some personality) might as well have been storms or whatever natural disaster of your choice. Mordremoth was the only one who was done half interestingly and he was killed instantly.
---
Joko, for example, was a WAY better villain. And people actually love Joko, i've never seen even close to that much hype for any of the dragons.
---
Can all the theives come, too?
---
That's what happens when you cater to ultra casuals that play 1 hour per week. 
---
The game is way past its prime and it feels like a waste of time to play right now. I wish it wasn't that way because I want to play the game but ANet doesn't give longtime player a reason to do so.
---
Great research, thank you.
---
Its like with every other container that Anet introduced in the past and has one or more super-valuable (infusions) items on its super-rare loot table.
---
You basically make a loss opening them compared to selling them on the tp unless you get a lucky drop, which usually spikes your average container value so hard that you got more value out of opening them.
---
But considering the amount of containers the average player farms through the course of a festival or event, I would always suggest them to sell them on the tp instead of opening.
---
&gt; Also, seems like the lag on obtaining lots of stuff is now more or less gone? Prolly best fix in the game so far.
---
Thats by far the best news in this post.
---
Remember to make a note of where you hung it, it's invisibility will make it difficult to relocate.
---
No, but the rouges are invited.
---
I'll keep that in mind. I still have a few days before I can transfer, so I'll check it thanks!
---
I totally didn't just wake up 30 mins ago I swear...
---
That's probably why that_shaman finally told us, sadly. He's normally pretty good about avoiding spoiling any fun surprises like this, so I can't help but read it as a tacit admission he's given up hope.
---
Ingots are only used in discovery for a few upgrade, bag and tonic (artificer) recipes, and no discoverable upgrade recipes use bronze ingots. 
---
If you can't discover anything with them, that means you already know them all, or that the recipe is purchased or automatic instead discovered.
---
You have not made any insignias for it. For each piece you make you also have to have a insignia to deterimined what stats you want on it. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Insignia Here is a list of them so you know what ingredients you need. There is no reason to buy any recepies for it at this level. You can buy rare recepies for karma later of if you want, but you can craft your leveling gear that is blue and green without.
---
He dont need to buy any recepies at all. You discover them at that low level.
---
That's fair :P I just love testing my skills against those of others
---
You don't need too do that at all if you just want to level crafting. You discover recepies and the reason you can not make any now is what i said above you simply need the insignias which you have not discovered yet. Check the link i sent you over what you need for those.
---
Thank you! I was quite proud of that one ;)

---
&gt; I wonder about the chak egg though, i find hard to imagine it is rarer than aurilium or the other infusions
---
You only get 1 Chak Gerent Chest after a successful meta, so only one shot at the infusion.
---
The aurillium infusions come from AB meta, where you get 5 grand exalted chests at the end, so 5 times more chances at a drop per meta. Plus, when AB multiloot was a thing, it probably flushed plenty of supply of aurilliums on the market. Considering that you can just extract those infusions and sell them on means that their supply isnt really dropping because they arent getting destroyed.
---
Putting this here for future readers:

To people wanting gift of aurene read this. If you farm Dragonfall mistborn Coffers you are guaranteed one [Gift of Aurene](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistborn_Coffer) after opening a thousand. I linked the wiki page of the chests; down below in the notes/references you can read the referenced anet quote. I can also vouch for it since I got one this way. Happy grinding.  Better than 50k of this.
---
That's not necessarily a bad thing. Josh set the standard for SAB. But once the standard is set, it it's easier for someone else to go on and finish his work.
---
What gear would you craft at lvl 28?
---
Aurilium was a recent addiction to the loot table, i think in 2 years? It didn't drop during the multi loot fiesta
---
Maybe a key to just enter the hub. And put a VIP  zone inside it.
---
That's a reality rift.
---
A trained Skyscale can use them to unleash a path of volatile magic orbs they can use to reach places much higher than they can  reach on their own. 
---
Basically a sky bridge for flying mounts.
---
The paper you use matters a lot. A rough paper doesn't have a flow or allow for mixing very well. You kinda stain it.
---
Something like vellum is very difficult to control but lets things flow well, allows you to correct mistakes. Etc.
---
You'll want two types of brushes. A normal round brush. A filbert (the rounded flat). The filbert is extremely useful. Its good at blending colors, and providing a variety of brush strokes. Those two brushes will be enough to get you through anything.
---
For painting... Make use of Varnishes.
---
This is something a lot of water color painters forget. When you layer up your water colors, you are lifting the pigments off of the medium again, which causes them to get mixed.
---
This is CRITICAL to note. As often times when you are lighting something you need to introduce hues that have contrasting pigments that helps to keep colors lively when you add white, or let the white of the paper show.
---
Having the Varnish also means you can blend two heavily contrasting colors into each other without creating an earth tone.
---
There are no banner slaves in WvW which was his long term goal
---
Nice research, also would be good if you add it to the wikis droprate research page

I would prefer now that world 3 and 4 were different styles than 1 and 2 so we could unlock and use mounts in one or 2 worlds. So we'd have a different classic game style on each level instead more of the same, and so making the new levels was easier as there would be less focus on tricky jumps and complex map designs:
---
* World 1: Platformer, straightforward with simple fights. 
---
* World 2: Metroidvania, more focus on secrets and backtracking.
---
* World 3: Beat'em up like Golden Axe and cadillacs &amp; dinosaurs, more focus on fights.
---
* World 4: Zelda style adventure rpg, with a single map containing 3 mini-dungeons and the castle of the last boss in t he center instead levels. More focus on puzzles, and can't complete all puzzles on the first try, because you have to unlock the tools required to complete later puzzles by replacing the first 3 worlds and get previously unreachable tools. 
---
* Boss castle: Use everything learned in all 4 worlds. 
---
You'd be able to unlock mounts that you'd use to move faster between the minidungeons, and to fight in the beat'em up level like with the golden axe mounts.
---
But I'd be fine with anything that meant completing SAB.
---
I wasn't around last april. Did they reintroduce the start of world 3 with the djinn and the achievement for destroying the true enemies machine, which is motos ex-krewe?
---
Not a farm but helpful:
---
Right now you should do the Dragon Bash dailies. Sell everything you earn (taffy &amp; coffers). Every 5 days of Dragon Bash dailies you get a special chest, choose "Jorbreakers" as your reward and sell those as well. 
---
Easy gold for the time committed.
---
thank you for the help!
---
After 1k its guaranteed and else is pure luck. Small note, if you get one as a lucky drop before the 1k mark I think it checks your account off of already getting one. Here is the thread regarding this in more detail in the replies from an anet person was mostly about the rare unid gear but it was brought up here. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/buqi7y/mistborn_coffers_limitation_in_getting_piece_of/epjaqds/
---
Well, SAB skins are ugly as fuck, but the gamemode is SO fun that I would never leave w3 or w4 if they ever add it.
---
People should seriously start using the search function. This question comes up too regularly.
---
They are a bit bugged, you need to do them twice for the mote.
---
If you haven't gotten one before 1000th coffer, you'll get one at 1000th. After that no more guarantees and only RNG.
---
level 80, first Path of Fire story mission.
---
Do you think the other guy would have posted if he hadn't gotten the infusion? How many other people like him are out there who opened high amounts and didn't post their "omg look i got infusion thanks anet" posts due to not getting one?
---
Guy is an idiot who doesnt understand anything, don't mind him!
---
I love it, very nice colors!!!
---
First mount you unlock is Raptor, after completing the first PoF missions, Sparking the Flame. You don't have to be level 80, but in that case you'd have to activate PoF story in your journal and accompany someone else who's doing that story instance, accepting the progression for it at the end.
---
Thanks
---
r/titlegore
---
&gt; But considering the amount of containers the average player farms through the course of a festival or event, I would always suggest them to sell them on the tp instead of opening.
---
And that's what I dislike about the way GW2 does festivals, when 90% of the time you lose out a lot by trying to actually get event stuff and instead every event devolves into the old "grind to sell for gold".
---
I dunno if I remember it correctly what Josh said but I think they already dropped the monetisation approach for the release of World 2. World 2 was basically on Joshs own time, so they only "lost" his work force for the time of the development.
---
However the projected player numbers vs actual player numbers didnt meat the quota and Anet didnt feel like its worth losing a dedicated and skilled developer/designer for a game mode that not many are playing. I think this is where Anet just fully gave up on it. We all know they only reinstated it because of the loud community. I would be interested to know if the annual festival format brings more people in now than before.
---
You had an opportunity to say "Aw. Keep trying. You'll get it eventually. And don't mind me. I only have eternity. So luxurious." And you didn't. The last time I saw such a waste of potential it was the Norn lore. Â 
---
I can tell how much love you got from your girlfriend
---
So what you're saying is, As always :   
---
Anet Festival Grab-bags are nothing Less than hot garbage and a dick slap if you want anything valuable out of them , and As Always they've gutted the entire purpose of a celebration because nobody will care about the festivities, Only grinding for that 1 Quadrillionth of a percent of a chance to get something Semi-shiny that'll just feel purchased anyway by the time someone's sunk enough gold into it to get a payout.
---
What's even the point of having them on the loot table, seriously.
---
Cant really tell if you are burned out on the game if you simply want more and the game doesnt provide that. If its the latter the taking a break and playing smth else will likely bring you hours of fun elsewhere but thats not gonna improve the game here.
---
I personally revisit the game every 4 or so months for new lw content since its the only thing that gets added to the game, tho i am also looking at the other mmos getting all their cool stuff and i feel kinda bad.
---
I dont think the op is burned out personally, i believe he just wants more content from the game which is a fair thing to ask considering how slow was the last year.
---
You can actually be a low lvl and just join the 1st PoF story mission to someone already on 80 lvl. That person do the fighting, you get the mount (raptor).
---
So what are you going to do with that infusion?
---
Isn't there a fire or volcano area before the water area? Iirc from the map
---
The current rewards are abysmally outdated, too. Congratualtions, you reached a milestone of 28,000 AP!
---
Here's a zenith weapon you disliked so much you've already chosen 18 other skins over it, along with 1% magic find and 2 laurels.
---
But wait, there's more! Here's a whole whopping 2 gold.
---
I hope you like it. See you in 500AP's time for another 2 gold!
---
I think that zhaitaffies are too cheap right now to bother, better keep them/exchange for jorbreakers.
---
What a strange looking Asura you got there.
---
this most makes me wanna login. fuck I love my soulbeast.
---
Wholesome meme
---
I dunno how to feel about the premise of a sunk cost fallacy. I avoided oldschool runescape because I didn't want to see a game get thrown back into microtransaction land.  regardless of whether or not MTX arrives I avoid the fuck out of the game because I don't trust the dev
---
criticizing GW2 development strategies is weird because they seemingly built the games existing content to last, and a significant amount of time was spent to made sure people had shit to do so that the game could sustain a playerbase between releases.
---
I honestly dont see that, esp on the content that new releases drop. U can prob complete the content of a lw update in a week (unless it has a tomegated item, that will take a week or 3 usually)
---
This isn't capes. I am disappoint.
---
Came here for this comment
---
Why is everyone in the picture arguing?
---
Asuras are not that tiny.... :O
---
It should arrive Soonâ„¢
---
So is this out of US available merch? I can't believe it
---
Check your hard drive condition
---
You won't be able to get the best armor, nor legendary weapons.
---
SAB was such a high quality addition to the game could it have been a stand alone indie game. It's a shame they abandoned it as it had a lot of potential, unfortunately this is very common with Anet.
---
I might actually be interested. I really would like some cool apparel with the Chronomancer logo.
---
Crafting doesnt matter for a while if you're starting out. Look into it once you're 80.
---
They need a way to farm that isn't 100% rng, same for the Dragonfall weapons.  Like each time the meta is done you get 1 of some new currency, and then at like say 50-100 you can go buy a skin (not the ascended wep itself).  That way completionists have an actual goal instead of 100% rng.
---
A lot of new players try to keep up with crafting while they're leveling and find it rather difficult-- cause it is. Honestly it's better to get to 80, save up a good bit of money, then do it. You WILL Eventually need it to get to higher level content like raids (debatable) and fractals. It's mostly used to get ascended gear (second highest tier, but matches highest tier for stats) which is untradeable, and will only drop at higher rates in those higher level content modes which you need the gear to get into in the first place. 
---
Unless RNJesus decides you're his favorite star and you just get random chests out in the world or in wvw or something. 7k hours and I've maybe gotten one?
---
There are other ways to get ascended weapons out there, like doing certain achievements and the whole Trahearne bit. Trinkets and backpacks are easy to get through certain living world maps you can farm, but armor you will really only get through crafting.
---
Most likely sell, I have no use for it.
---
Dragonfall has weapons?!
---
That guy needs to get laid.
---
Ikr right? Stuped as AF.
---
Thats normal, they seem to set "salvageable" flag manually to every item and there are plently of ascended items that don't have this flag for any good reason months or years after release.
---
Why'd you have to do this to me, shammy :(
---
Yes, I think the container is Gift of Aurene.
---
Well this year's SAB event was a cool addition, I really wouldn't mind having SAB always on with the festival for time-specific additional rewards.
---
It may be a trinket from PoF. Many trinkets bought with map currency can't be salvaged.
---
From a quick look, it looks like the maker of the clothes is primarily if not exclusively female wear.

---
Are .. are you talking to Reddit?
---
Oh I see, I got from drop but cannot remember where. What can I do with it then? I cannot seem to sell it either.
---
They are both really great but W1 certanly does fit better into the role of an annual gw2 event. W2 is well on its way of wanting to be a stand alone game.
---
That's not a title.
---
The fact that a non-tradeable ascended weapon container is just as rare (or possibly more rare!) than an infusion is just weird and silly. I guess it could potentially have a small impact on the economy by reducing the number of ascended weapons being made, but people really only want them for the unique skins and if you wanted ascended container drops you'd be farming T4 fractals anyway. Just seems like they made it annoyingly hard to get one for the sake of having something else to put in the super rare tier.
---
So, after playing the game for many years, my general observation is this: hold on to everything.  If you need cash at some point, you can always purge your supply of all materials to make some money.  When some day you decide to start crafting, you'll be so happy to have some kind of stockpile there to make things easier. It's not that you can't always buy materials, it's just that it's a satisfying moment to discover that you have a supply of a needed material when it is needed.  There's something about having collected it myself that I always find rewarding at those moments.
---
They have the same skin as ascended weapon with extra bling on them. They are pretty meh for how rare they are.
---
IF you don't plan on using it, you can alwys drop it in the bank, maybe hoping it becomes salvageable or useful for something in the future, or just destroy it. 
---
Since it's harrier stats, it may be useful for a healing/support build.
---
Good god. Aint nobody got time for all that. Open all, sell expensive exotics, salvage all rares with mystic salvage kit, salvage everything else with copper fed, deposit all, keep playing.
---
While out of combat.
---
I've named mine Flappy Mapbreaker.
---
So your saying thereâ€™s a chance!?!?
---
    -Lloyd Christmas
---
But it also means that even though you get all the rewards, doing event is valuable.
---
I see bigger issue that people care more about gold than about unique event rewards.
---
Ok, I will keep it for now then. Thank you!
---
In contrast to WvW where the commander is always playing the largest charr/norn with the enlargement potion from that living world map just so everyone can keep track of where they are.
---
Well I'm yet to get a reply from you so I'm assuming it's a no show ^^
---
The taffy is currently worth more than the jorbreakers.  1 jorbreaker is 1K zhaitaffy.  Zhaitaffy is roughly 1 silver a pop right now.  That's 10g vs the 6-7g you get for jorbreakers right now and the jorbreakers are trending down.
---
I agree with you but engi has less health than warrior :P but spot on with the other points
---
good for player that want to dress as their characters, since about 95% of chars are female anyway :p
---
&gt; you won't have my nooby ass ruining your ranked games
---
I don't really play anymore so I don't worry about that. I just genuinely believe this game is unenjoyable without years of experience thanks to how crazy the damage is in the game. 3 autoattacks and you're dead. There is no skill involved and new players are exploding left and right. It's not fun for them, or anyone, which means PvP can't keep new players.
---
And what's the """""balance"""""" team doing? Rolling out more damage buffs each patch. Fucking degenerates.
---
Gen 1 and some Gen 2 Legendary weapon collections are also scavenger hunts. I'm doing the first collection of each, and it's quite fun :)
---
Hello, I've added your data with your name to the wiki drop rate page, if you do not mind. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Coffer/drop_rate
---
Of course you would say that while attempting to corner the market!
---
Yeah, there is a small chance of them from the mistborn coffers. IIRC, you're guaranteed a drop after X amount of opened coffers if you haven't received one yet.
---
I think they're cheaper because most people aren't taking the holo skins and are just taking the gold bump from the hero chest.
---
Out of the 3 I listed, I play WvW the least, so my WvW estimate could be off.
---
It happens to me from time to time. 
---
No need to get stressed about it. Just do other stuff.
---
What I do when I'm bored with GW2 is to play GW1 or pick a random title from my ever growing Steam backlog. But then after a while I get back in full force.
---
And since the gear ceiling is already established, you wont lag behind if you spend some time out.
---
We have just one life, try to get the best out it.
---
you NA ppl should be happy by now as how many things was restricted to NA
---
I've done the event container openings for years.
---
Matchmaking isn't random in Survival, you need to bring your own group.  So I don't know, would your friends kick you?
---
This is a major asspull, but did you try attuning it to see if they properly coded it or if it's some delicious spaghetti and you can't salvage it only in the "base" version ?
---
Stop playing full glass cannon and whining about blowing up. Damage is maybe a little high, but you're clearly playing incorrectly.
---
How many hours do you have in the game?  Well over a thousand?  How many hours do other non sub games give you as a one time buy?  The thing is, it seems like content is coming out slowly to people like us, but the reality is since we play so much and have for so long, the new releases are grinded hard because that is the only new content in the game for us.  Go play something else for awhile.
---
Also, saying 6months per release is disingenuous.  I agree they are getting further apart, but don't exaggerate.
---
No, you won't get hurt by skipping crafting professions on your first character, but you would miss out on a few levels of easy character experience -- Each crafting level gives 1-4% character experience, depending on the level bracket of the crafting profession.
---
You do *eventually* want to get some crafting professions up, though. Probably a combination of professions that will let you do the ore/log/cloth/leather daily cooldowns -- Weaponsmithing and Tailoring together is one combination, I'm sure there's a few others.
---
First thing you need to ask yourself is what kind of game play you enjoy:
---
-Open world Pve? (events, farming, world bosses).
---
-Group oriented pve? (fractals, dungeons, raids). 
---
-Achievements hunt? 
---
-Role playing?
---
-Pvp?
---
-Large scale pvp? (Wvw)
---
Search for a guild based on that. Most of the very tight close guilds are the ones that focus on some activities and do it together, thus, they create bonds due to that.
---
My 2 main guilds follow that logic and they are the ones who I do most stuff with.
---
I partially agree that there aren't currently real meaningful long term incentives with each release, but there is still lots to do.  The issue for long term players is that they spend all their time on the new releases because that is the only new content for them.  That means it gets completed quick and then back to nothing new.  The story to me is pretty underwhelming so personally I'd rather they give us mediocre story like previously and focus more time on other things.
---
Wtf anet, common now.
---
If you're at HoT go on Emikadon's HoT run tomorrow, at least some of it. You'll meet lots of peeps and if you're cool I'd bet you could find someone to send you a guild invite. https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c965uy/na_monthly_heart_of_thorns_map_completion_train/
---
Given that the Kaiser snake and Crimson assassin were never realised as bosses (see King toad and the Storm wizard) and have had their weapons distributed through alternate means, I have a feeling that we're never going to bring the smackdown to Lord Vanquish.
---
We might get some purple SAB weapons eventually but that will probably be it.
---
&gt; If you can't discover anything with them, that means you already know them all, or that the recipe is purchased or automatic instead discovered.
---
That is only the case when they stop showing up in the discovery tab.  When materials show up in the discovery tab but are red, it means there is a recipe for you to discover still, but your crafting level isnâ€™t yet high enough to craft it.

*"Hey you, you're finally awake"**
---
They will ahve to make a new game eventually. It isn't like GW2 is going to last forever.
---
There was originally no link when it was posted and not much information in general, once they added the link it was probably "too late", or still too vague. Anything that isn't Fan Forge is interesting to me though.
---
Well, yeah. But that still means you can discover something with them. Not yet, but you can. 
---
The Discovery panel will even tell you the level at which you will be able to discover something with it.
---
Yeah. The only stupid question is "Can I ask you a question?".
---
The result is the same, sure, but removing points would piss people off.  Thatâ€™s all ;)
---
&gt; If you go there with ranger, you will be hated by everyone, kicked out of every squad and shouted about to swap to proper class. 
---
Is that really the experience one would have?
---
I don't join squads because I don't really care but ouch.
---
Material storage expansions and bank tabs are a great investment.
---
I have like 3 tabs of silk scraps ready for the Jubilee's Bazaar.
---
A new players won't  have ascended gear to do T4s with xD.
---
They also likely won't know their class well enough to do Raids or CMs.
---
So out of all you said, only WvW is an option, and its for a random drop they mau or may not use.
---
Most likely they will need to craft their first set of ascended.
---
GW2 isn't my main game, but part of my rotation of games so I'm not particularly burned out or compelled to play constantly. You're eventually have the same feeling in almost any other MMORPG you play. People with WoW do the same thing too after every expansion. FFXIV was also dipping because people were waiting for the new patch and wanted to save money on sub until then.
---
Tell this to those 40k AP people with 25k hours played lol.
---
try a different game, ff14 newest expansion shadowbringer just officially launched and holy shit the whole expansion is a mindfuck in a good way! just when you thought they couldnt fuck you enough, they just continue pounding you until both your heart and mind are turned into mush. one of the greatest adventures i have had yet! excuse me while

My entire raid static has been feeling this way for a while. We still raid weekly, but these days it seems we spend more time playing borderlands together than GW2.
---
I've seen 4 statics in other guilds I'm a part of completely leave GW2 and go to other MMOs instead.
---
I wouldn't necessarily say the game or even just raids are dying, but... Nobody can expect players to wait this long between content drops this size and still be playing the game the rest of the time.
---
While I did some of the other dungeons, I have to say Cathedral of flames is my favorite. I miss having to be good at aggro pulls in GW, that really did make things interesting.
---
You don't clearly answer the question. I'll assume it means you decided to post *before* you knew the results, which is a good thing :). So the bias we're talking about is not here. So my initial point stands : we don't know enough to claim that the rate is "way lower than 1 in 50k".

Unless you're crunching your own numbers for builds, the hardest part of Warframe is figuring out their UI. Everything else is simple

---
If you just want the achievement for killing the Eye at 20 stacks, you should be fine. It depends on HOW off-meta we're talking. If you've got totally mismatched stats, weapons that don't make sense with your gear/traits/skills, then you'll struggle. It's not hard to get to 20 stacks, but it's definitely possible to lose if you're not playing well.
---
Yes it can have a good social aspect if you join the guilds which are good for you. It can be long term fun depending on you of course xD
---
OK, I was confused reading the actual post as to whether or not this was in-game costume or IRL clothing. The responses here helped clear that up.

use GW2Hook, i ts much better. Wooden potatoes has a vid on it too and he has presets listed in his Reddit!
---
I'm not sure where it went wrong for GW2 pvp. They devoted plenty of resources to it early on and for me personally, I can't definitively say I lost interest because of Conquest. I still think its a good mode that allows different playstyles to coexist, unlike deathmatch modes or what have you

---
This is junk, right? Not salvagable but sellable? Why is the fourth most populous item *junk*??
---
This isn't a bad idea and increases your salvage value too. I've never seen that ring though, it's not a standard drop. It may be some weird PoF drop as someone has said, or tied to an achievement.
---
Still those should be salvageable though.
---
What you're describing is *how* you reached burnout, not what it is. Re:
---
&gt; Burnout is when you've been playing a game to a point where you can no longer sustain interest in it. Either you've beaten it, became frustrated with it, or otherwise feel drained by playing it.
---
I'm not going to bother with things like ambient dialogue or kill x with y weapon achievements either, but that is stuff you can do and explore in GW2. It's a highly repetitive game and the development pacing is of course slower. If all you want to do is the PvE stuff, then it's perfectly fine to just log in and do the new thing and move on. For people who want it, there are tons of long-term goals to work on in each game mode. Legendary gear, cosmetic unlocks, fractal progression (omnipots+fractal god for example), etc. GW2 is a grinding game, but instead of grinding better gear you're grinding for wealth to collect all the things you want to unlock. That's pretty much how it's been from the start with the minor exception of adding ascended gear.
---
WoW has a subscription model. Their player retention lives and dies based on how often they put out new content to keep players interested. GW2 is a box purchase game with free online. Their revenue is much lower because their only income sources are from the box sales, gem store (vanity/account upgrades, and merch. There's no way they could match the pace of a very successful sub-based game.
---
If you're staying with f2p for a while, you can still do fractals and silverwastes farming. I would highly recommend the competitive parts of the game, WvW and PvP, if you're at all interested. You can get pretty far in those even without expansions.
---
First question- Yes, Second Question- No

While gw2 does have a group, squad and guild mechanic... since the content itself to 90% doesnt force you to rely on any of those, the social aspect of gw2 has rather rapidly declined. Its not dead per se, but slowly getting there. 
---
So, finding a still very active guild in gw2 is rather difficult atm.
---
On the other hand, the game is so casual, you really can just log in for 1h each day and still get good progress. Put plainly, outside of PvP there is no "challenging" content in gw2. There's t4 fractals with CM and raids that are a bit more demanding, but in the end everything just boils down to "know your character build well and dont stop attacking". Especially raids are nothing compared to raids in other mmos, no gear treadmill, no increasing difficulty, very reactionary mechanics (when there is this, always do that kind of mechanics).
---
So, yes, gw2 is the perfect mmo for beginners and people that want to experience an mmo casually. And if you can find an active guild, theres your social aspect. On special days theres usually some form of community event (pride parade for example), but those are gettting rarer. You probably will find a WvW guild to be more active nowadays, so Id suggest for you to start looking there.
---
Okay, for a test I played like normal today without tabbing out. I played through all of Ossuary of the Unquiet dead and told Trahearne about the cauldron. So that was about 2-3 instances where it was possible to crash out (the instance where we learn Orrian funeral rites, the recon with Kekt, and then For Trinity). I then swapped characters and tried to enter Fractals and crashed immediately. That's roughly on-par with normal, so I think tabbing is not it.
---
Lib couldn't turn up to reset so they delayed it.
---
It takes so long to tab out of fullscreen that I'd hope that's not a solution. But I might try that sometime.
---
Wasnt there a Forum Post about the event? I cant find it anymore.
---
Ah that's a shame, sorry it didn't help!
---
It's worth levelling up your crafting for your armour type as well - crafting at low levels is quite cheap and nets you a *ton* of experience. 
---
Crafting is also a reliable way of getting ascended equipment, so you'll probably want to get it to 500 sooner or later on two disciplines.
---
Personally, I wouldn't salvage that. I'm farming so much to get harrier trinkets.
---
Hope not, first wvw event ever that I was actually looking forward to
---
That's a great reply haha. Thanks for your advice man. Aside of what I want, a great community with helpful people is really important for me, so that's a good point for gw2
---
you can argue about anets release schedule and speed but the amount of content needed to satisfy you is simply not feasible. or at least not financially feasible.
---
Is already attuned! I thought it cannot be salvaged because not attuned so I did it. But in the end still cannot salvage haha
---
Log into your gw1 account and it should fix itself
---
A bit off-topic, but has anyone else also gotten audio bugs when they used a custom soundtrack?
---
Back to the question though, Skyrim or Assassin's Creed 2's soundtrack might fit, give them a look.
---
What do you mean a power meta? Just for Warrior? Because the amount of scourge, FB, mesmer spam I see flooding my bar with malaria does not seem power oriented.
---
It will be probably right after Dragon Bash Festival along with new WvW/PvP Weapon Set.
---
Well, it's not NA reset yet, and WVW, so either canceled or just waiting on NA cause screw EU times, as is ANet tradition.
---
ArenaNet and their team kinda forgot about WvW and Gandara's forces
---
Everyone else has covered some basics (most PoF specs except renegade, deadeye, and maybe mirage are very strong). Other than that to your other question, base warrior and guardian have some strong builds out there.
---
[Here.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/coming-soon-wvw-core-swap-special-event/)
---
Honestly, each zone of world 2 could have been its own world. It might have needed a *bit* more content, but not much. World 1 zones are *short*, and I think world 2 zones could match that length pretty easily (especially with a mandatory detour through areas like the 2-1 hillbilly cave). They would mostly need a few more nooks and crannies to explore to keep each zone from being too linear.
---
On top of the excessive length of each zone (not taking in to account the shortcuts) they just feel wildly disconnected. World 1 is pretty cohesive: start off in the forest, which slowly gets darker and damper as you progress. Other than the token transition to the ice section at the very end of 2-2, there's not much of that feeling through world 2. The Rapids, Cliffs, and Storm Top all feel very visually disjointed, and I feel like it would have benefited from being called separate worlds.
---
They are an American company I'm sure if Arenanet were a British or European company everything they do would be based on these times. Its not screw EU.
---
I think the most social part of GW2 is in WvW, find a wvw guild and join your server community. You'll get closer to your guild over time since basically every guild activity has to be done together, and outside of the guild you can get to know the people on your server (not always in a pleasant way though). In pve there's little sense of a permanent community to form those bond imo, unless you get into a discord community related to your pve content, but then it the game doesn't even have to be an mmo to get that kind of interaction.
---
won't matter. i used to craft on new characters to get fast levels but i dont bother anymore, i almost never use crafting because most of the time it is not a whole lot cheaper to craft than it is to just buy on the TP, even when it is cheaper it's usually because of timegates (ascended gear) and you'll save maybe 5 - 10 gold or so, last time i checked.

&gt; No, I don't want content that demands social interractions 
---
&gt;So I want a MMO with a strong social aspect
---
what ?
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/coming-soon-wvw-core-swap-special-event/
---
GW2 is probably suited to your needs but I wouldn't say it is fun for the long term. I often find that I play in 2 weeks - 1 month bursts every year or so, any longer than that and the game just feels like a chore. If you are playing for 2 hours a day or less and you have friends who still play then you will probably be fine. The social aspect depends largely on how social you are, if you make an effort to talk to people and shit then you will probably enjoy the social aspect, people don't go out of their way to talk to you, though.
---
Most of these WvW events happen on Tuesday-Tuesday basis... because... that makes sense. It is because of server patches and updates but yeah its dumb.
---
&gt; as is ANet tradition.
---
Member when they would do their reddit AMAs on a workday at 1 AM GMT?
---
I always forget something, To the Aussies and New Zealand people. N.A. Friday is your Saturday, so our Saturday is your Sunday. Just be aware!
---
Reset isn't for about 5 more hours
---
Fuck D&amp;D.
---
You should try doing a comic series, instead of just random scenes now and then. Do it!
---
Same as you would on a bag opener: sell everything. For unidentified gear, last I checked it was more or less a wash between selling the gear as-is and identifying/salvaging/selling the results. Definitely don't salvage the unid directly.
---
Quadim has four arms.
---
Qad erat demonstratum.
---
It's a current event boss from a few years ago. You basically need a bunch of players to overwhelm him
---
Unfortunately that doesn't help with what I assume OP wants: the ability to eat Dragon Bash food throughout the year for, you know, food buff purposes and have it count rather than putting it all to waste.
---
that is utterly inaccurate, and it has been a long time since ANet required an actual patch to activate an event instead of flippinf a server-side switch. more over the last couple of wvw events all started, as intended, with the wvw reset of the respective region, so the events are contained within a single matchup.
---
You're still whining about that?
---
FB isn't condi xD. It's power meta because most classes are running power because it's the viable option. You're seeing FB scourge a lot because that duo is cheese and mirage because imo it's a average risk high reward class
---
Base guard has an insanely strong ranged AOE condition build of any class (burning) for WvW. But only like one in 300 people play it.
---
You can easily reach 10k DPS, sometimes up to 20k for a few seconds. (in WvW against players).
---
Because of the lucky infusion, you might have actually profited by this experiment haha
---
They are prob on par with each other but idk, i honestly would ratyer get it all at once and pay than have an expac's worth of content spoonfed over 1 and a half years.
---
True that doesnt mean u can strive for more and more consistently. Gw2 really suffers from a content release schedule.
---
&gt;From July 5 to July 12, defeating an enemy player in World vs. World 
---
&gt;From July 5 to July 12
---
Anets only consistency ;p
---
Yea, the original post didn't even say the company name. It was incredibly vague and people's mistrust was understandable. An unfortunate move on their part as I'm sure if they had made a more thoughtful post they probably would have gotten a lot of good feedback.
---
When you log into your GW1 account it can still take several hours to fix, last time it happened to me, it still took over 4 hours to correct itself, i wish Anet would do a final fix for this random bug.
---
Rough estimate but at Current Exchange Rate, it costed you $750 to conduct this experiment.
---
- 50k Coffers, round them to 25 silver each (which is 2-3silver lower) = 12,500g
---
- 12,500g through [exchange is currently](https://www.gw2spidy.com/gem) $0.06 per 1g
---
Minus all the flush you made back in gold, the value of the Infusion would be placed around the $650 mark, right?
---
I'm referring to the amount of information that hits new players in their face all at once. People gets overwhelmed with so many systems that are bad introduced (or not introduced at all). Gameplay wise it's relatively easy.
---
Yeah, they are too difficult for THIS game (Although some would say otherwise). FFXIV did it right: Auto matchmaking + easy for casuals + hard content for others, I just wish the combat was worth while.
---
It is known
---
I don't think it's bad, but I do think that this style would benefit more if it was a close-up/portrait instead.
---
They should cancel wvw tbh, what they did now made them some profit from transfers , yes, but soon we will have 4 desert maps :).
---
Reset is the same world wide
---
It's still pretty meh compared with many other builds in the game. Does it work well in PvP and I find it the most fun build to play, and in WvW it's pretty mehh and there are way more powerful options.
---
Thief is in a pretty rough spot right now.
---
Not really strange for WvW. Remember, WvW reset is on Friday.
---
Professor of Jumpamatics
---
that contradicts only one option i gave
---
We are here for you Poot Poot &lt;3
---
Usually, events are launched with every reset time (EU first, NA later), but this time.... surprise... they launch it in a totally different timing, without warning about it previously.
---
So, what happened?
---
Easy: yesterday was July 4th, National party in the States, so they literally forgot about having the event scheduled rightly in the system, and it didn't activate as expected.
---
If someone needed another hint about how Arenanet doesn't care at all about WvW, here is a new pill.
---
*Insert here a slow clap.*
---
I got so many guild banks stuffed with that crap, I'm afraid the next Bazaar will come too late for me. Tell me wife I love her.
---
I hope picking up the core swap orb
---
is optional. I am not looking forward to this event at all if they force you to replace your skills whenever you walk over a dead player.
---
What the hell are you saying?
---
So ... you cannot go high-speed like Bob Ross does ...
---
That's not true, so please stop lying. Auto attacks don't do 33% against protection.
---
Can't calculate it quite like that. Infusion is worth what people are willing to pay for it. I reckon it would sell for around 7-8k pure without tax. On RMT sites they're selling gold in various ranges, 7-8k gold is super roughly 240-300 USD. So that'd be the approximate value of the infusion as using the official money &lt;-&gt; gems &lt;-&gt; gold rates gives quite wrong answers.
---
Larx get back to your cave what are you doing out here.
---
Because reasons!
---

---
Heart* Heart of Thorns.....
---
Really depends on the class, some classes like Invigorating Precision Thief, Reaper and Chrono (argueably also Dragonhunter) can get rather ~~tanky~~ selfsustaining even if played as damage dealer in fullzerk equip.
---
Your personal dps does allways matter but its not needed to top meters, just stay within range of your team. Nobody's gonna trashtalk you if you lack like 20% of their damage but if you sit at half or a third of others dps they're clearly carrying you.
---
Just get ARCdps yourself and check your own performance in correlation to your teams DDs.
---
Also playing fullmeta is a stupid idea since it requires 2-4 group supporters if you look at raid-/fractal builds. So they assume you're running with full boons and have Stability or Aegis etc. to make that #lit deeps work! If you lack proper supporter classes like Reaper, Chronos and Soulbeasts are best since they buff themselfes a lot and you don't need to rely on others that much!
---
all the gen 1 legendaries from the base game can be crafted (or bought provided the gold) by people who dont have HoT and/or PoF
---
so youre saying if i buy 50k i can get a crystal infusion? :)
---
I thought I had it bad when it took me 15 kills big ooF I feel for you sis
---
Scourge is a great and fun condi build class to try.
---
&gt;This time I got an infusion but don't let it fool you, I got very lucky, actual infusion drop rates are way lower than 1 in 50k, we'd be flooded with the infusions if it'd be that high.
---
I wouldn't say *very* lucky. From what I've seen, "super rare" basically has a 1 in 100k chance to drop. Very few people open that many bags, I'd imagine.
---
Itâ€™s all luck like winning the lottery. My first stack of dragon coffers I open I received the Gift of Aurene and I didnâ€™t even know how rare it was until reading up on it. I did  1k more or so and nothing so yeah itâ€™s all luck.
---
Is this every month?
---
Dragon Bash and Labryinthine Cliffs both returned!!
---
The one we don't have much hope for is Old LA. There are plenty of immersive ways to bring it back (fractal and player hub being the bigger ones), but Anet seems to want nothing to do with good city design.
---
I can relate. To address this, Iâ€™m multigaming. Iâ€™ve always played one MMO at a time until I burn out. Then Iâ€™m away, come back and feel hopelessly behind. 
---
So now... When I want to relax and do story, I do ESO. When I want to work towards long term goals or just run around all smashy smashy, I come to GW2. 
---
GW2 canâ€™t be everything to me, so Iâ€™ve decided to be polygamerous. Iâ€™m a master of neither, but I got old and lost all ambition to be top tier in any mode. 
---
I have a few hours a week to play now, I canâ€™t change gw2, so I stay engaged at a slower pace.
---
Okay, when going for condi builds there are 2 usually options:
---
1) Shit out every single condition in the game the moment an enemy touches you (Scourge, Mirage)
---
2) Constantly pressure with highly damaging conditions like burning (burning Weaver, Core Guardian)
---
The reason for that is because most meta builds have a ton and a half worth of cleansing and to pass through it you need to either apply a lot of different cover conditions (option 1), or constantly reapply you damaging conditions (option 2). For exact builds I advise to check Metabattle, it gives a good idea of what's viable.
---
It doesn't matter how many an individual opens. What matters is how many of them players collectively open.
---
I get that but nothing is stopping them from running w/ you if they are not in the squad anyway lol
---
They're not bosses. They're random mobs. The orange snakes in W1Z2 and the red assassins in W2Z1+W2Z2.
---
Boss names are always mentioned in the loading text and what that shaman posted tells us there was only one boss figure left. Apparently W3 didn't have a boss but was a "collapsing Cave".
---
I answered the question why he can not craft anything of what he have. He even showed a picture. And the reason he could not craft antything of what he had was because he was missing insignias. 
---
The guy responding first tells him he have to buy recepies. And then asnwer about iron legiion. He do not have to buy recepies to craft only for that specific piece of gear. 
---
So if noone had actaully added the part of the insignia and why he could not go on, then he would still be stuck even after buying the the one recipie, no?
---
which means most of the time that selling is quicker as during the time you're opening them you are not chasing shinies
---
Raids with training discords and Fractals can be started with just trinkets from living world.
---
I guess that is why they do updates normally on tuesday at 6 in the evening on EU. But for WvW this is not possible?
---
It looks more accurate without the ears imo xD
---
Its going to be a key input to swap to the other skills, so even if you automatically pick it up, it doesn't mean it has to get used
---
You mean the horns? I donâ€˜t know why but with the horns it fits more I think.
---
No they started on EU reset on friday. Both of them.
---
Downstate event started at EU reset both times. Warklaw i am not entierly sure of since there was so many changes in time but i am fairly sure i made my warclaw on my main account on reset.
---
There's no "winners", only losers. And those are us, with Anet giving excuses when, once more, they messed it.
---
Backpieces can also be from PvP or WvW.
---
You could try the [Shrine Guardian Ears](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shrine_Guardian_Ears). They remove the horns on charr and add big ears. The crown part might take away from the aesthetic however.
---
ESO is, as everyone says, a good choice for most GW2 players. If you haven't played it, try GW1.
---
The ones I cycle through when I'm away from GW2:
---
If you like shooters and grind, I recommend Warframe. If you like the idea of playing a space flight sim, check out Elite: Dangerous (though they release less stuff at longer intervals).
---
How... how am I JUST hearing about this? Reset should be... interesting.
---
No, the first question asked by OP is in his first comment in this post. I quoted it. He posted that before anyone else replied. He doesn't care about the recipes he already has, he wanted to unlock some specific recipes which you can only get by purchasing them.
---
People have already mentioned necro and Mesmer. However I think most people are forgetting that the Weaver has a burn build that is quite strong right now. 
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver_-_Fire_Weaver
---
Basically with Glyph of Elements (next 5 attacks apply condi depending on your elemental attunement), along with Primordial Stance (pulses a condi each second for 5s also based on your attunement), and gaining Fire aura which burns enemies around you whenever you attune to fire, you can stack burns extremely quickly and consistently. Not to mention going earth stance fire stance mix with bleed is also an option
---
