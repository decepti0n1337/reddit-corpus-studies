Would still be good for me if the story goes something like: Aurene flies over to Cantha, meets Kuunavang (or offspring or Albax or offspring). Other dragon begs her to help in Cantha, Aurene gets back and we come over. Aurene and other dragon get eggs together.

This is censorship plain and simple. People who are genuinely not happy with the game they love are voicing their opinions. Writing them off as “trolls who use vote manipulation” is simple ignorant. The game is in a bad state for anybody who plays more than once a week and that’s clear to see.
---
We like people to voice their opinion. Lul

It's still gonna be cantha, sorry guys. Norn are gonna be fat, drunkard, bros and depart even further from their original concept and we're going to go to cantha in the middle of winter. They ARE gonna introduce a new norn, but he's going to be a bro douche bag and his name is going to be Chad. Season 5 is only going to be one map, and it's cantha, but it's the side of bloodstone fen, unfortunately. The reason they are doing this is so that Arena net can say "see? we did cantha, it took us 3 months, but it's done and we don't have to do it again" Anyway, can't wait
---
But for hard core casuals like me, the living world has to have some challenge too. Admittedly that fight was a clusterfuck and I didn't think it was fun, but the challenge portion of world boss in a game where that's the major update type has to be something more than just the equivalent of tank and spank. The problem is some casuals want some challenge, but not T4 Fractals levels of challenge and there's little enough of it in the game.
---
The other problem is everyone has different levels of what's difficult. The Living World bosses that are harder are a bit better for me. At least I end up remembering them. lol
---
It's my MMO and I'll HYPE if I want to. :P
---
Another wall of text full of shit that has been said 100 times before.
---
By the pale tree....
---
They're not going to get rid of it, but I agree with you, it's crap. It's a terrible mechanic. The worst part is is the dev who designed it bragged about it as a feature before Heart of Thorns was released.
---
&gt; Episode 6 did not have enough content to last +3 months

I already completed Wing 1 (all achievements), Wing 2 (almost all achievements, half Wing 3, almost all Wing 4. I'm not really a newbie. I Just have too Little time to join semihardcore and hardcore guilds. (I was into One when i starter raiding and used to run all the Wind multiple times a week) but i had ti change job and now i play more casually. And yes, the group was from the cross road inn discord too.

&gt;wow that video is good, it should be upvoted then its manipulation
---
I believe admins have generally have treated this as manipulation. Got someone banned from the site when they did it in... r/lol or r/overwatch iirc?
---
Check out the [rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-constitutes-vote-cheating-or):
---
&gt;Vote manipulation is against the Reddit rules, whether it is manual, programmatic, or otherwise. Some common forms of vote cheating are:
---
&gt;*     Using multiple accounts, voting services, or any other software to increase or decrease vote scores.
---
*    **Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.**
---
* Forming or joining a group that votes together, either on a specific post, a user's posts, posts from a domain, etc.
---
"This should be upvoted" usually counts.
---
yes, why wouldn't u?
---
Thanks so much for all the info; I'm intrigued. I play ffxiv (never really played wow), so would you say the challenging stuff is equivalent to like savage difficulty? That's my main enjoyment of the game (although I thought maybe gw2 would be to relax for a bit from ffxiv).
---
Also, is there a dps meter I can download 3rd party or that's included in the game? I'd be really interested in looking for optimizing rotations and such.
---
&gt; **for personal gain**  
---
nothing personal go gain, not against the rules. it was not his video.
---
The achievement and [chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dhuum%27s_Top-Tier_Supplies) (like you get from most CMs). Completing all achievements in Hall of Chains gets you the "Voice in the Void" title too
---
And it's like communicating with a brick wall. ArenaNet probably doesn't have the resources to change anything. But hey, it's mostly venting for me.
---
Ninja edited, this morning there were calls to upvote certain posts posted by the people on stream. Karma counts as personal gain.
---
It's like.. Anet didn't already say they're doing S5 months ago. Reddit is so dumb sometimes. Bitching for a week cause no news about something we know won't be coming for at the very least 2 more months.
---
Then anet comes with a "season 5 is really a thing" and you lose your minds.
---
That DH may have had bad gear as well and may have been kicked after you. Regardless, beating one (bad) DPS isn't exactly a clear picture of your DPS. Maybe get some more pulls and post logs in this thread or seek help in the training discords?
---
I've dialed down my play but I usually just said "I have this wing's title" and that was enough for KP. I don't think I've ever had to ping gear.
---
Isn't that what every youtuber does?

Gee a company times it's announcement to coinicide with a major convention to get more publicity, which they don't do often enough and people complain about and you're complaining that they're dong that. 
---
In the forums I've been arguing that they would make an announcement that doesn't go head to head with the FF XIV announcement, because you know, they're a business and need to do things strategically if they're going to move forward and anyone with half a brain can see they're trying to move forward. Saying it's not good enough to make a special announcement to get more eyes on the game is bad how exactly?
---
Wouldn't that be the equivalent of using blood?
---
It's almost like it's an important topic for a lot of people.
---
New elite specs impact the game way more than new mounts do.
---
The 45 minute LW5 announcement "stream" will be pre-recorded.
---
ArcDPS is a good DPS meter you can download, and I've not played FFXIV myself so I can't say. But I honestly doubt it. Many raid bosses have challenge modes that make the fight pretty cool, but the lack of reward for repeating challenge mode makes it a one and done deal for the achietvment. I'd say raids are mechanically quite simple but the difficulty tends to come from balancing your rotation with the mechanics and constant movement on some encounters. If you go to snowcrows.com (a site for meta raid builds) and scroll to the bottom of a page for a build you'll see some raid fights from that class' PoV, might give you an idea of what it's like.
---
Thank you a lot!
---
there’s a leak in the boat!
---
You forgot the new Viera race that comes from FF XII.
---
Yes there have - absolutely every gaming subreddit, for starters. Especially FFXIV.
---
Ofc:-P
---
Its not surprising at all that the mods are trying to tone this place down.  Yeah the game and the developer communication very much has its issues....  
---
But this subreddit has become both a place where enthusiasm for the game comes to die and a place where any constructive criticism is met with hard fanboy-ism that has the attitude that anything outside their comfort zone is bad.  It both complains about not enough to do and then when they add something that you know might take more than a weeks worth of play time to complete a full on rage here.  
---
I hope the devs have written this place off in terms of getting any kind of meaningful feed back here.  You have people here that stopped playing the game, months ago, wanting everything to be achievable on the day of release so they can quit again then turn around and complain there isn't enough to do. Collectively the subreddit is very bi-polar.  
---
I am glad they started sending out surveys to get better feedback and become more effective at reaching people that you know, are actually still active in the game.
---
the resident data miner on this sub mined a string that came with the last update. it read something like "you are now leaving the demo area" or something like that. iirc that was the only thing hinting at something like that
---
yeah and "valid complaint" is whatever they feel is valid at the moment. they may not like some complaint, say its not valid and ban the person.
---
I’m not saying we didn’t already know about ls5, I’m saying a lot of people in this sub were crying about how anet hadn’t said anything about it or confirmed it . Some people even being extra dramatic saying “if” ls5 happens bc they think the sky might be falling. So they should be happy that anet announced an event for the ls5 announcement
---
It's actually not that hard. As soon as you become used to the mechanics and the moments, you will become better every day.
---
I'm not complaining about their "special" announcement, I also don't care about if it buts heads with FF14. Although I do believe that ArenaNet, should properly compete against companies/games that are trying to dip into the MMO-playerbase or why would Guild Wars 2 players play a game that clearly has no care/innovation behind it?  
---
The main problem is how long it takes them to announce their "content" and how fast they get the product out to their consumers. And the players of Guild Wars 2 can clearly see that there is a huge content quantity gap between GW2 and it's competitors. Time is huge.  
---
Again, the announcement that they are doing is great to try and gain publicity for the game, and doing it at a convention may help, but it is the content in that announcement that is important. If it is just the same Living World Stuff, then it has me worried.
---
... just like these posts

Yep those are def eyes, I really think we are going to see the Far Shiverpeaks again.
---
I, for one, am glad these rules are in place. The doom and gloom was getting excessive, going in circles and full of people yapping about stuff they didnt like about the game and quit it years ago, which totally arent relevant to the current situation.
---
Its not bad having a topic about concerns of the direction of the game, but having the main page flooded with half a page of the same thing with people just repeating junk for days and days just make this into a subreddit thats downright unpleasant to visit.
---
ohhh they are re-releaasing Living World 3
---
Right because George's softdrink should go head to head with coke. Do you know anything at all about business.  I ran a shop for a long time and when the big guys ran their big specials anything my advertising said was overshadowed and that money was wasted. During big sales at other places we didn't spend the money advertising at all because it was wasted money. We wouldn't have gotten return on it. It was a bad business decision.  Anet is not stupid not to go up against a bigger IP that's available on both console and computer, that has movies out, that has XV produces in their line, that's part of a bigger company that sells even more.   It's a terrible move to go head to head against them.
---
  
---
It's a smart move to capitalise on the people who hyped it up and will inevitably be disappointed, as some people will no doubt be.
---
That was a glimpse, not a fight. He's only sleeping so it's a matter of time before we actually confront him.
---
Sorry, if the term "fanboy" was too antagonistic. It was just the best term to describe some of the die-hard fans of GW2. I've seen posts where people think that Guild Wars 2 is absolutely perfect, with zero flaws - but I always believe there is room for improvement.   
---
I think there is a difference between the content I want as I'm a WvW player. I love Guild Wars 2 WvW, but it isn't doing to good as Anet doesn't care for the mode when compared to PvE.

---
The sulfate has been chucked, it seems.
---
I see a dragon, but I don't see snow.
---
I see foamy water and waves with a dragon head rising out of the water. When you get out of the water in game, "water drying spots" appear around the border of the screen, and those dots are in both bottom corners of the image. 
---
The spraying, foamy, splashing water theme is all I can see. It's hard to envision it as snow.
---
GW2 just isn't a fun game to watch. You can't tell what's going on at a glance.
---
PvE zerging? a bunch of lights everywhere, I try to stream it for some of my friends, whenever I do a world boss they don't know whats going on.
---
When I watched people do dungeons all they did was stick in a corner and cleave things down, its laughable.
---
There's almost no visual impact for the viewer when content is being played. If I can barely see what's going on at a glance how do you expect people who don't play GW2 to?
---
The game is beautiful but you know what? no one cares because 90% of the time the person streaming has their camera pointed down so you can't even see the art.
---
Downvote all you want guys, it won't add viewers to twitch.
---
Can’t wait to hear more about it and to see how the scope may be different this season from last 2 seasons. Especially looking forward to find out if they release any expansion pack typical features during this season.
---
It's like the people excited about this and the ones complaining aren't the same and have different views...
---
Only if it agrees with my opinion though !
---
Okay,  thanks again for all of the information.  I'll most likely get into it then
---
Maybe we have skiing in our future
---
The LS teams being stretched so thin probably had a lot to do with why they kept missing deadlines in S4 tbh.
---
I don't think is announcement is for us anyway. We're already here. It's at a convention with people who don't play this game, and they're trying to get the word out that stuff is happening here. I'd be very surprised if this announcment did anything to affect us directly. They want to advertise the game to people who don't play it, not people who played it for 5000 hours.
---
I don't need to feel better about myself. This was coming from a perspective as someone who like u, thought the same stuff 2 years ago and have since gotten most stuff from raids and led countless training runs. U don't want to listen that's ok as the one thing I truly cba with is wasting time on people who don't listen. I only hope others read this and take u as an example of what not to be like if wanting to raid.
---
Have a good day.
---
They said the next story won't be about world ending stuff, so I doubt it's about jormag and primordus. They're moving away from the end of the world storyline.
---
By the eternal alchemy!
---
The background were different at LS3 and now. 
---
Before LS3 came players *wanted* to get more maps. If you look back, we got "only" two maps with LS2 and some people were disappointed that HoT had only 4 maps, even though they are very good. 
---
Their announcement that maybe not every LS3 episode will get a new map was more like "we want to do that, but maybe it's not possible" and not "we look what could be the best". To be fair, a new map per episode was the best option back then. 
---
However, players noticed and Anet noticed too, that this isn't the best way (on a long term). This way also have it's problems. 
---
Now they changed to "we look what could be the best". Bringing new maps, but not with each episode or expanding existing maps like they did with Dry Top and Silver Wastes. 
---
Tldr; They said more or less the same now and at LS3, but the context were the exact opposite.
---
Because this isn't targeting us. It's targeting people who don't play the game. It's not at a Guild Wars 2 convention it's at PAX. Why do people think everything is about the guys who are already playing. We ask them to get more players into the game and advertise, and they're doing it. This has zero to do with us.
---
hopefully the commander can afford a swimsuit, walking in undies is shameful

You forgot Cantha.
---
I am not telling people to fake kp at all, where did I say that? All I said was how easy it is to fake it and that in my case personally it took very little amount of runs before I knew exactly what I was doing, so it made sense for me to fake it.
---
He left to work at AGS
---
"I'm going to not listen to you, blame you and publicly shame you because you didn't have as good an experience as I did." 
---
Yeah, thanks.
---
Honestly, do as I did. Sit down, read every single one of your abilities, weapon skills, and traits, and understand what they do. In PvE the druid buffs with warhorn, heals with staff, and when your Celestial Avatar bar is full you can go into Celestial Avatar mode which gives you access to potent healing, crowd control, and buffing tools for as long as the bar lasts.
---
Honestly it feel 90% of people on this game don't actually know what their various traitlines and skills even *do*, and thats like 10 minutes of reading.

U 'avin' a giggle m8? Decades and centuries are named for the year they start in. The 1940s didn't start in 1941, they started in 1940. Go back 2019 years and you'll see 0 AD, not 0 BC.
---
I'll be disappointed if they decide to make it focused entirely on Braham, Taimi and/or Aurene.
---
Really this. It’s more than a standard reveal making it seem like It’s more than status quo. If it’s a nothing burger, expect people to be angry.
---
I have no idea why everyone thought LS5 was gonna be a non event. Did y'all really think they were banking the game on treading water?
---
Really wish we had daily peak and concurrently active numbers for this game like most other MMOs with at least their steam portion. It DOES feel like this game is on the swift decline though, I don't see 98% of my friends list online anymore unless it's for raids.
---
DO IT

I think there's like, one pair of light armor shorts in the game? Maybe two?

Get on it, ANet. I need my summer style.
---
So what's the consensus on the new thief Shadow Arts line/it's rework? Any good? Thinking of running my daredevil with critical strikes &amp; shadow arts since I like the boost to stealth from SA.
---
&gt; Is there evidence of a coordinated effort? It just seems like normal reddit to me where a broader change in opinion of the subreddit causes people that hold that opinion to come out of the woodwork.
---
&gt; What kind of vote manipulation? Is there evidence of this?
---
As per the Reddit rules: Asking people to vote up or down certain posts, either on Reddit itself or through social networks, messaging, etc. for personal gain.
---
As moderators we have no proof because we can't see who upvotes or downvotes, but in comments and in messages to us there was evidence that it might be going on. Additionally we have banned duplicate accounts made to troll from accounts we already banned for trolling and that is a site wide reddit rule break as well. If we are given proof or seriously think this is happening again our only course of action is to message the admins which can take up to a day to respond sometimes so we put that in there because if we feel there is enough evidence to show that is happening we could erase it. But short of having a video or image proof of someone saying hey go spam the reddit with upvotes best we can do is just message the admins and warn people.
---
&gt; You say it’s not censorship but you basically have given yourselves a broad check to remove any criticism as “complaining for the sake of it”, as well as locking the post and not allowing any changes to the updated rules WITHOUT looking for community feedback on the matter.
---
The team decided to lock the post due to what happened with our last attempt to clarify the rules which was instantly brigaded and I got some very disgustingly PMs about it. Moderators have absolute say in what goes on in their sub and we only have your trust that we will do the right thing. There is nothing I or anyone else on the team can do to prove that other than through our actions. We are giving us this broad check because after the last few days we feel that we need the ability to use it even though we hope we won't have to. We do not want to be the official forums. As everyone can see there already was a post made complaining about the state of the game shortly after this one and it has been approved even though it was heavily downvoted and even reported. As you mentioned there are legitimate reasons to complain and while the sub downvoted that post the user brings up some legitimate points hence it was allowed. But when we get 10-20 posts in a day which then leads to a dozen brand new accounts being made to spamming memes and game is dead you all suck for playing it, action had to be taken.
---
go check out the movement of the world lore on wiki.
---
&gt; Making the sub text only is something I have brought up a few times personally and been shot down both by other moderators and by a lot of users here. 
---
I remember the time it was text-only - but it was different time. Even though I dislike low-effort cutscene screenshots and direct template memes, I think that this far into the game, image/video posts make the sub a better place because
---
* most things that *could* be discussed in text have already been discussed in text ad nauseam over the years, 
---
* new things that are worth discussing in text are still mostly discussed in text anyway,
---
* some things even benefit from being presented in image format before being discussed in text.
---
not gonna even waste my time explaining how im not worried about "if i will be able to do the same". dont want tips nor critiques, i just want the name of the specific program he/she used.
---
We get 10 votes on a release about the same praise to Anet (ex story was great. Mount was awesome.) Why is criticism treated differently? 
---
Also what is to gain from threading a reddit moderator? Some people need to grow up.
---
No problem.
---
Generally the only time we'll actively remove memes is when there is a flood of them all on one subject. I think the last time we did it was 2-3 balance patches ago when there were like 20 mesmer nerfed memes and we started removing them after the first few hours of it as to not completely flood the front page.
---
People voicing their dissatisfaction for dissatisfaction.  Welcome to /r/GuildWars
---
Is (this)[https://puu.sh/DXQB9.jpg] your card?
---
Does Reddit have a bandwidth issue? If it’s low effort it will get downvoted and everyone will move on.
---
Pretty on par with the arguments to keep it as is and very good points all around.
---
It's tough to please everyone as there are many people who would love the text only sub but others who are here specifically for art, screenshots and memes.
---
Mine was more a critique of the other guy's critique. If OP's not gonna answer you, it's probably Blender, Maya, or 3dsMax in order of probability.

I’ve played GW since launch. But that doesn’t matter when you criticize it these days. The newly formed casual community treats communication as praise or downvote to hell.
---
thank you friend
---
I'd wait, engi is in a terrible spot right now.
---
That or reroll another better class.
---
The issue some people have is that 'I made my first legendary' posts get upvoted heavily but many people feel that those should be removed per the low-effort rule as it does not take any effort to take a screenshot of the game's UI and post it to the sub. It's a meme itself in the sub at this point because there are a lot of those posts.

I feel like we need a litany against hype.

 I must not become hyped. Hype is the game killer. Hype is the little death that brings total stagnation. I will face the hype. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
---
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
---
Where the hype has gone there will be nothing.

Only the truth will remain.
---
Welcome to last week I guess. Where everyone was saying they same poop. 
---
Basically 2 years of free content wasn’t satisfying we need an expansion
---
I'd settle this on pareidolia so I dont get hyped over nothing.
---
It's not like casuals will share anyway.  That's why people are leaving.  It's not like you're playing it alone, or are you? ='/ God forbid GW2 ever actually require cooperation again.
---
&gt;Also what is to gain from threading a reddit moderator? Some people need to grow up.
---
Ego. It's almost always about ego.
---
Yeah what else do we have at this point. Might as well cling to hope they announce cool stuff
---
Cause things change. Your comment about Bethesda is about games in development , not mmos currently running. Projects get scrapped or drastically changed all the time. For example, a dev at Blizzard said , something as high as 50% of projects started don't make it. And Diablo 4 is an example. At one point , they had changed it to a Dark Souls type game instead of an isometric arpg. Then they realized that was retarded , and reverted that design decision. Why announce shit that isn't finalized?
---
“I’m so cool! I threaten a Reddit mod, let me tell my friends.”
---
this reddit is over censored as it is. the fan made facebook page might be the answer after all. newbs to the game, guild recruitment, memes and screenshots and basic questions are all still allowed there.

Hearts and Minds was fun as fuck when I did the CM with some guildmates. Imagine two reapers just carrying while everyone else was downed and out. Insane self healing and sustain!
---
This is a very smart and knowledgeable comment. It's nice to see it. Business decisions and design decisions should work hand in hand not duke it out.
---
Good. I'm tired of that shit. A personal story with small stakes, about the characters, would be fucking amazing.
---
Yeah , I'm a fan of the Diablo franchise. Watching what happened there, with Diablo 3, Diablo Immortal, and the upcoming 4, is very interesting from the business vs design stand-point, although as a fan it's frustrating.
---
Would you go penguin sledding with me?
---
I'm just looking at reviews for Shadowbringers. I've never personally played FF14 as I'm afraid of jumping into another MMO, but supposedly the expansion is pretty incredible and I am just hoping GW2 can develop something great like this, but I feel like ArenaNet is either, not trying, or lacks the resources.   
---
Also, I'm mentioning the fucking ArenaNet extremists that love to praise anything that they do. They are like a cult that would get spoon-fed shit and love every bit of it. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY MY POST, it is just dumb.  
---
So fuck me for wanting to keep that kind of toxicity off this thread? People shouldn't be so defensive on the terminology of "fanboy" unless they are in fact a fanboy lol.
---
Constructive criticism here is toxic.  Don't even bother.
---
I mean......how is this shocking? GW2 has never been a very stream worthy game, even when PVP was actually cared about.
---
What happened to your main account? Did you get banned or something?

With how long Taimi has had a degenerative disease she should be dead by now.

It is funny, I tried to make that part of the post for more of a deterrent, but it worked in the opposite effect.  
---
States: "I don't want fanboys in my chat"  
---
Results: "Fanboys feel attacked thus commenting on the thread"  
---
It is strange how it works - it is like some clickbait level shit, but hey I've already had some good discussions/arguments about GW2 so you may call it tactless, but I think it was a success.   
---
You can clearly see who are passionate about GW2 and think it can improve over the droves of people who mindlessly consume whatever ArenaNet spews out.
---
Maybe you should stop talking.
---
"AfTeR siX yEaRs I fInaLlY CoMplEteD thE mAp 10O%".
---
Well, I didn't get banned for being shit at the game, that's for sure.  You *know* you're doing things wrong when even the game itself puts you in the penaltybox 4head
---
It's easy for two reasons: 
---
First of all, the "trash mobs" lack really good decision-making most times. (There are exceptions when looking at "factioned" mobs like Forged or Mordrem, so your mileage may vary.) This means you can very much spam attacks and not worry too much about it unless you pull something like 5:1 odds with Veterans/Elites in there. Even then, it's possible to win. (It's technically possible to solo even Legendary mobs, though that takes a lot of skill and effort which translates well to *nothing else*.) So what you have then is a world where the danger winds up being more in running too far into mobs and getting focused down rather than seriously being challenged . . . though LS areas/missions are potentially exempt from this. (Do not take them too lightly the first few times through.) 
---
Second? Open world being open, it's entirely possible to just zerg many things into oblivion. All old-world metaevent bosses are beaten by the tried-and-true Ascalonian method of "throw more bodies at it". Just pooling on a target spot and beating it into submission with as many players as can literally not crash the zone is practically the only strategy you need to know. Again, there are exceptions, but really most things can just get forced through this way. Given this is something which happens sometimes with FATEs on FF14 too... the saving grace is the much smoother "scale down" method GW2 uses. (I seriously, seriously, dislike the sync *method* of FF14. The idea works since it does mean you can stick high-level events in low-level zones . . . as terrible an idea as that may be . . . but forcing it to be activated rather than happening automatically is an issue.)
---
Sidenote: WvW falls very much under the same umbrella here, since "throw a bigger blob at it" will work a majority of the time. (Not 90% of the time, more like 66%, because it's far easier in WvW to outplay or outdefend.)  It's challenging because running around solo is a death sentence if you get caught, so don't do that if you can help it. 
---
Dungeons are harder than open world because it's limited to one party, thus it's a lot harder to "just bury it under bodies". Fractals are harder than Dungeons because they've got gimmicks and Agony comes into play as a ticking % degen to health over time. Raids are harder than Fractals because they layer in time limits to the major encounters on top of this, and really require knowing what the encounter wants you to do before engaging and expecting to win. The biggest difficulty in Raids is knowing what you need to do and when, then executing it . . . theoretically any player still can do Raids, as long as they've got moderately decent gear suiting their role. (There is technically no need for the highest tier equipment, it just makes the margin of failure more forgiving. *Don't try to do it in "Fine" to "Rare" gear, though*.)
---
At least, this is what my experiences have been with the game. I could be off base on some of the higher-difficulty things, especially Raids.
---
That is definitely true, Final Fantasy resonates with people much more than GW2.  
---
I'm always get asked the question by my friends and family: "What the fuck is a Guild Wars?" lol
---
Because even when GW2 was new and fresh it never had much twitch presence.
---
wonder if its tengu related the wall by kessex looks a bit different then it used to
---
She's only like 16. Depending on it's real world equivalent, she could have a good amount of time left.
---
but why. theres fractals. i think an easy mode raid that doesnt give any serious rewards until the last boss would be a better idea if you just wanted a more noob friendly raid.
---
&gt; It's obvious that ROBLOX would be more popular, people go there to do memes and bully children
---
Take notes Anet.
---
Jormag and Primordus are in lore each other's weakness. If we fight one, we cannot ignore the other.
---
Some daily achievements have variations for lower level characters and accounts without access to expansions.
---
For example, today you can only do Daily Loreclaw Expanse Jumping Puzzle if you are on a level 31-49 character which is a replacement of the Daily Chaos Crystal Cavern Jumping Puzzle daily which is in a higher level map.
---
Other than this, the progress, as already mentioned is account-wide.
---
Would it make more sense to say nothing until the hour arrives where they get up on stage so do the thing?
---
Sounds like you're making more assumptions. Of course I've played heal ren I was one of the first to gear it and try it in my static groups. Really wanted to make it work because I like the tablet mechanic, but it's a dog shit healer with brain dead boons application. Good with boon thief comp, but I don't rate it for any other fights.  
---
The comment about me raiding 5 times a week was in response to being accused of pugging, and nothing to do with skill. Here's the real take: using FB/Ren comp also doesn't make you a good raider automatically.
---
If you really didn't care then you'd not have taken the time to make a response just to insult me again. But ok.
---
Not according to the map chat I've had to sit through in the last month or so through the World Boss Rush and Dragon Bash. I just boot the game now and then, realize I missed the bus on all the content I didn't have time for last year - or earlier . . . and thus never will get anything done anymore. 
---
Except for being made to feel like I made the wrong choice clicking "login".
---
Maybe you should stop deleting your account.
---
Your fashion sense is utter shit anyways.  All you do is stack legendaries and roleplay as a christmas ornament.

Thanks!

GW2 was actually the first MMORPG PvP I ever played. I'd often heard people complain about how awful MMORPG PvP typically was, so I was really confused because GW2 really does have fantastic PvP, I played it for years!
---
....Then I tried other MMO's like WoW and FF14, and oh boy, were the naysayers right. GW2 PvP really is above and beyond.
---
I also love the pvp but I got into it sort of late. I wish there were more of us :/
---
Fractal meta is irrelevant to raid meta. Ren/FB is the better support comp for organized fractal groups, but chrono/druid is still relevant for pug fractal groups due to how hard it carries mechanics.  
---
FYI meta is determined by usage. There is no governing body that determines what is meta and what is not. Over time, the general consensus will shift towards what it best. The only people I see trying to shit on chrono/druid are the same fanboys who've been riding renegade's nuts for the last 2 years. The general population don't give a fuck.
---
Yeah I'm not going to transmute my legendary weapons and armor to please you.
---
When they start putting their wood inside lettuces....sigh
---
Been an engineer-only player since the closed beta, ain't about to break a streak now!
---
Been playing game of thrones season 8 this whole time, maybe we'll get to play game of thrones season 1.
---
I have no expectations. There'll be a vague announcement for LS5 possibly with a release date and some teaser footage.
---
And that isn't disappointing, because that's all we could have expected given we knew LS5 was coming straight after LS4.
---
NO MEMES FOR THIS MAN!!! 
---
(Sorry if you are not a man :( please just replace man with your preferred designation)

---
Its almost as if you were the OP of this thread on a freshly created alt account.
---
What's your purpose exactly?
---
The upcoming release will be Build Templates, 9 new elite specs, Season 5 will come one episode per month followed by the next expansion with a new race.
---
...c-come closer....
---
No, he didn't.  He got the name wrong. He got how you stay in the air wrong, he got how you get it wrong. He got how quickly it loses height wrong.  The skyscale isn't ANYTHING like he says, except the part about how it's a flying mount (which is literally the most generic thing you can say about a mount to hype people up.  Fuck off with your "he nailed the skyscale" bullshit.
---
Very nice post, it is true that I've never been a completionist/collector of Guild Wars 2 achievements, however I go for the earnable cosmetics that I find interesting. It is definitely a play-style that ArenaNet has targeted. I personally dislike it as a majority of that type of content bleeding as it can be extremely grindy, rather that what I perceive to be "fun".   
---
I am however, a competitive player. Sadly ArenaNet has lost interest in their competitive modes, nor have they focused on delving into a more complex combat system. I am one of those players that theory crafts and plays every single class/specialization - it is one of the things that provides me the most joy and expansions can provide specializations and classes, but LS usually does not (Maybe a mount w/mastery). 
---
I play the story and the maps/meta-events to be "wow'd" with a hope that there is, in-depth mechanics ingrained into to the fights/environment, and hoping that either ArenaNet puts forth the effort into creating new assets and presenting more grand-set pieces. Triple Threat is an example of a good, challenging open world boss.   
---
 I felt Kralkatorrik's story interactions were better than his open-world counterpart, but why would I want to experience the best set-piece ArenaNet has to offer, in a closed instance? I want to experience it with other players. I don't want to pop his zits with other players. That is the problem I have with Dragonfall, and I am almost certain that resources/budget was definitely an issue.   
---
However, I can see that the other mechanics on the map were well utilized when compared to the previous episodes. Episode 6 was definitely the best out of S4 as it should be.
---
This is speaking specifically with regards to posts such as memes, i made a legendary or other show off posts. If it is a blatant violation such as hate speech or something similar than it will be removed regardless, but posts that some consider low effort but the community as a whole upvotes it, things like that we will usually leave up.

Ah. Okay because that would be a pretty bad thing.
---
Check wiki and see if its counted as second or third.
---
Not any good.  Doesn't really provide much.  Theoretically, it might be useful for a Ninja Nurse type of build focused on defense and healing, but there just isn't enough in the Thief kit currently to make that worthwhile.
---
All the stealth boosts you can get in there are offset by simply going for more damaging traits elsewhere to boost your Backstab, assuming that's the stealth attack you're intending to use.

I wouldn't mind.

If only arenanet agrees, the pvp has a lot of potential in this game for greater things.

Same. Season 1 is what hooked me.
---
Good questions!

I really want it to be snow but some people are saying it's ocean waves looking out from a cave and now I see that too and it's driving me crazy.

---
It also helps that Shadowbringers is by far the best Final Fantasy content in ages, has been selling amazingly well, and has received amazing reviews across the board. Word-of-mouth can do much more than any advertisement.
---
Meanwhile I have been out of the loop for GW2 since the last expansion, don't have any friends who play it, and haven't seen any news or videos about new major content since.
---
They're not going to have an entire expansion devoted to underwater combat, wouldn't be too surprised to see it featured a bit more prominently than it has so far though (which is basically not at all).
---
EU
---
i reset my net too
---
Inb4 it ends like how the ffxv special livestream ended
---
All of those look absolutely terrible.
---
I had flashbacks to Sun's Refuge announcement with the amount of false hype people are building up. I won't be surprised if the disappointment is just as high.
---
They weren't. They wouldn't have the staff for it, since they were working on 2+ "non-Guild Wars 2" projects behind the scenes during the majority of Season 4, until NCSoft demanded profits now and forced ArenaNet and other companies under NCSoft West to scrap all in-development projects and layoff employees.
---
We don't know what those projects were, though one seemed to be a mobile game, but a number of employees who worked on PoF seemed to have been working on them.
---
According to Guild Chat, they didn't even have a direction to go after Season 4 until development on Ep4 began (in other words, shortly after Ep1's release). Though according to an often-bitter Jessica Price, they didn't have a plan until Episode 3's release (when they announced that Season 5 would follow Season 4).
---
Even if they had a skeleton crew working on an Cantha expansion, an expansion is not a Living World season. Nor would an expansion be worked slowly from first map and story to last necessarily, so even if they were working on an expansion but had to change it into episodic LW, that wouldn't necessarily work because the work would be largely spread out, not centered in that first release.
---
No, most likely, the S5E1 team is the same as team that did S3E1, S3E4, S4E1, and S4E4. So it would have been worked on since A Star to Guide Us released.
---
The community has never been friendly when it comes to content related issues. Both the veterans and the casuals have their own selfish agenda and the casuals just happen to have won. Now the veterans want compromise with things like raid easy mode just so they can get any difficult content, but the direction of the game is too far gone.
---
Yes, make everything babymode. Or better yet: make everything play itself.
---
Get a support ticket.
---
[Actual troll accounts](https://www.reddit.com/u/Petrillss) that unironically do nothing but spam "lol ded gaem" are not critizism, it's trolling.
---
[Literally bragging about not having played the game for two years and only being here to bash it] is also not critizism, it's a mental health issue.
---
Going "its anet so its going to be bad" isn't critizism, it's toxicity.
---
It's high time this sub grew some teeth. I know no other sub that would tolerate an account that is literally solely made to decry and bash the game as dead and bad for as long as r/GW2 did.
---
Some minimum of hate filter is a good thing. If someone can't express oneself beyond "lol ded gaem", nothing of worth is being lost.
---
Ofc it got brigaded. watch teapot's stream of that day and you will see and hear it.
---
I still jump at the opportunity to do the CM with friends/guild. Its so much fun. :)
---
But that's actually the right move for building hype... They never do that.
---
Congrats you found ol Nessie during a snow storm.
---
Poor thing, the lake froze over and she just wanted to come up for some air.
---
Ooof what a crit
---
Totally agree with you. This place was becoming an echo chamber of hate/discontent - and it was creating a distorted impression of the game, and the state it is in. You're right, there was a very real risk of it becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, it was pretty much there already. I wouldn't be surprised if there have been hundreds of people who were interested in starting GW2 (something that would only be healthy for the game), being put off by all the hate chat on this sub. A viscous cycle had begun, and I'm glad it's been stopped. I think the somewhat drastic measures are a good idea.
---
Some realities:
---
\- GW2 has some issues for hardcore players.
---
\- The recent moderation is straight up censorship - but what moderation isn't?
---
\- Censorship is a dangerous game (can lead to manipulation of the truth).
---
\- Sometimes some censorship is actually healthy (cue Americans yelling).
---
We might have to call the UN to dispose the sub as toxic waste material if this happened. Holy shit.
---
Probably mirage dodge.
---
I'm pretty sure they meant "immediately" in the sense that there wouldn't be an expansion in between LS4 and 5, not so much that LS5 would come out just a few months after 4. 
---
Assuming this announcement is for LS5, they're actually decently on track for their usual release cadence, given that the announcement is 3.5 months after LS4E6 launched, and their usual release cadence for LS4 has been every 3-4 months. I imagine that the release date for LS5 might be anywhere from September to February, likely on the earlier side.
---
Maybe it's Maybelline
---
So basically nothing is coming/happening in the next 5 weeks apart from the hat grind.
---
This exact comment is on every gw2 trailer
---
I just want to join Jormag. I've wanted to since seeing [this concept art](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/d8/Norn_svanir_female_concept_art.jpg). I'm going to be super disappointed when Jormag dies.
---
So many characters would be named Weed
---
Yeah, It wouldn't display the video thumbnail, but I guess the link still worked. For me at least, reddit seems to be finicky when it comes to showing the videos or perhaps I'm still reddit illiterate. I took the advice from a comment and posted the video in the link category/tab by using the youtube share button for reddit.  Sorry for the confusion.
---
Not punished, if you're cool like everyone else you have one of each profession. If you don't have that, don't be poor - drop ten bucks on a character slot.
---
You'd retain your primary skills and weapon skills but you'd have access to non-elite traits as well as utility skills from the other profession. Ezpz
---
I mean, that looks kind of like an in game screenshot, so presumably you could recreate the character...
---
the forum posts removal was valid. it was removed due to being non-factual or something which is true since Nike cited no sources for most of the stuff that wasn't publicly said and never said stuff was based on his speculation rather than facts
---
Playing a game you don't have fun with is not healthy but obsessive behaviour. MMOs attract people prone to addictive behaviour, including abuse, denial, lashing out and everything that goes with it.
---
"I just love that game so much!" is wife beater mentality. "She made me do it, I wouldn't have to do it is she would just listen more."
---
It's a game. If it's not fun, move on.
---
Build templates.
---
That's a good point regarding the scope of the problem, but it would be nice if something was done about it at all.
---
Comparing complaining about a game to abusive relationship. Nice.
---
If you’re talking about the class, it’s a Firebrand Guardian. If the appearance, you can recreate it with a ”total makeover kit”
---
Armour i’m not entirely sure of.
---
Wow that is really well made!
---
i did try my best to setup the automod to handle that but to not get other casualties limits it quite a bit
---
I wonder if they'll announce dyeable Weapons.
---
Yeah.. Just kidding.
---
Still going to be cool to see what it is.
---
Maybe the commander has an internal battle with schizophrenia.
---
I doubt it will be long until release unless it's something truly massive. Having a stage announcement and then dropping something immediately is pretty hot for games at the moment. I won't be surprised to see a "And you can play it....*right now!*". At the very least it's on a Friday, and wouldn't be surprised if it's released the following Tuesday.
---
Ah yes, the time where you hadn't had the /dance * command and had to sync that ALL BY YOURSELF
---
Jup the combat system has extreme potential. It just isn't being explored properly.
---
Gw3 will be set 100 years later. We lived enough to be the bad guy. You'll see
---
The plebs who keep parroting "MMORPG PvP bad" have obviously never heard of the legend of GW1 - a game that was built with PvP in mind first, and owed much of its success to an [extremely active](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/7fl3h1/how_big_was_this_games_pvp_scene_at_its_peak_how/) and [competitive PvP scene](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/8i8y77/some_very_welcome_attention_for_gw1/).
---
Weed is a *perfectly respectable* name for young, budding, male asura. Why, did you know that Weed the First was a renowned genius of his time before the asura were forced to surface by the Elder Dragon Primordus? Weed the Third, why he, he revolutionized transmogrifiers. Shame he got killed off by a renegade golem when he tried revolutionizing power cores. There was another Weed, unrelated, who spent years improving the original asura gate network.
---
Now Weeb, that's a sad little name given to the dumbest of asura children. Or those expected to be dumb, at least. I do think there was a Weeb or two who became very knowledgeable in bookah art. That, too, was before asura surfaced. Don't ask.
---
Have you tried removing that stick from your ass, or is it too deep in? :)
---
Maybe.
---
We might get to see that concept art become reality. Dragon Bash had a dialogue with a female norn who revered Jormag (and was curiously marked as a "reveler" so she was celebrating Elder Dragon defeats).
---
I really hope its not worse then arcdps.
---
You should have gearsets and skill/traitsets and then combine them freely for buildsets.
---
Rich coming from you
---
Why wouldn't I? I've been around long enough that I might as well check it out. It's 1.5 hours of no effort content for free every 4 months, not like I have to make heavy time investments or dedicate any effort to it.
---
I went to the gw2 thing in Seattle like 4 or 5 years ago for pax where they showed off tequatl, they had swag bags which included cards with codes on them to get special items in game, both mine and my wifes cards didnt work and the rest of the stuff was just junk pretty much. I dont think anyone's gonna be pushing people for them
---
Yeah I’ve never expected anything from a video game other than that it entertains me. 
---
GW2 entertains me so I like playing it.
---
Two blue and a green
---
For one thing, its up to anet to counter those claims with hard facts.
---
For another, GW2 already has the worst rep of all western mmos. 
---
And also, for some of us it really DOES feel like the game is dying. Nearly all my friends have left, Im in 3 community guilds that are inactive now and the players I meet pugging raids/fractals could just as well be bots, thats how much they communicate and interact.
---
Looking for a new guild resulted in me wanting to shoot myself, because the guilds I tried out either were just way too... I dont know how to even call it... I felt they tried to be bad on purpose to show how casual they are. Wiping in CoF1 of all dungeons :( Or they were just guilds for access to guildhalls.
---
I'm calling it: Season 5 intro + GW3 mega reveal
---
&gt; Is there evidence of a coordinated effort?
---
There are at least two people with some mental problems spilling the venom over sub for 7 years, who operate on multiaccounts and create new one if previous gets banned. There's a pattern in their activity and overall image.
---
It's actually a connection issue (from their side, most of the time). I've seen it every once in a while.
---
I remember doing this story with three others. During the final fight, the other three ended up in timeout. I managed to solo the rest of the encounter while they cheered me on. I had fun, but not sure how it felt to watch.
---
None of them have any meaningful rewards, every cool skin lands in the gemstore. That is the price we pay for LS.
---
&gt; Why wouldn't I?
---
Because
---
&gt;It's a chore
---
Games shouldn't be chores. Find something else in life to spend your time on that makes you happy dude.
---
That post wasnt true or even relevant back then, it isnt now.
---
How to make everyone happy? Silence everyone that's unhappy! That'll work!
---
I'm sure making dissatisfied customers go elsewhere and spread the word about how both the GW2 reddit and the official forum silences any criticism of the game's direction is somehow going to improve the situation. Great call mods!
---
I mean, they are very similar. It’s addiction and dependency and all that jazz. Folks are so invested, and care a lot. Maybe they care too much. When you care about something, you leave yourself vulnerable. Sometimes it’s worth it, though. I love, and it hurts, but I don’t regret that.
---
Absolutely
---
eh, it wasn't relevant back then either..and especially now because you seem to conflate the main idea of that post(grinding stuff) with an overarching concept of dissatisfaction
---
it's just a generic feel-good, "kinda makes sense right?" type of thing..while being anything but that!
---
if you scroll down past the pointless fluff of "i spent 5h admiring the pixel detail on a tree, farmers are noobs and should be ignored"  you'll find some resonable replies
---
they're mainly pertaining to some people wanting different things from others(shocker!), expectations of design choices in line with..let's say "industry standards" and back to different things in the form of "i want/enjoy X from this game but Y from the other game"
---
Imo what Gw2 pvp is really missing is something like alliance battles from gw1, with 16v16 setups made up of 4 teams of 4. They managed to create a format where zergs consistently lost to intelligent tactical /roving play, and where you could jump in a pug and be useful, but also jump in as a planned group and be much /more/ useful.
---
I would also love to see more casual asymmetrical pvp along the lines of Fort aspenwood in Gw2.
---
This is advertising and marketing too. Everything ANET has been doing recently is an answer to the communities requests.
---
I miss gw 1... Gw2 just doesnt gets me as much ...
---
Man, I miss Southsun
---
C A N T H A pls
---
or the Shiverpeaks. I'd accept that.
---
The dying sub of a dying game Kappa
---
definitely seems reptilian in nature
---
Why should it be bad that the game is really dying?
---
I Mena it'll just push anet to do their best to 'fix' it
---
How can I not overhype this upcoming announcement when my expectations are already at zero. The slight thought of them doing something is bad. So I try to think of the worst case scenario and if that doesn't happen then my expectation has been met. For example the annoncement of gwmobile, or new gem store items are where my expectations are at.
---
It doesn't help that many of the arguments are baseless. Take the whole "no new content" nonsense. In the past 3 months we've had a number of bonus events, a revamped festival, a new LS release (that was substantial in what it offered), a new raid and a balance patch. This has also been released roughly at the same cadence as other content since LS3ep1. That was 3 years ago. For it suddenly to be an issue now when some streamers are deciding to try out different games has felt *very* disingenuous.
---
Hi welcome to GW2. If you need help leveling up or anything just message me in game. 
---
OMG! ANET waited for one whole month, 30 days, to announce something. I initially thought it was going to be in four days! Screw you ANET for tricking me and making me wait! Why didn’t you announce the announcement a month ago? Then when I didn’t read the date right, I would have thought it was a month and four days out instead of two months and four days. I wish ANET releases some more unfinished content, that would be fantastic. Did I mention how dare you for making us wait in alien s for a month. Back in other peoples’ days they waited almost eight months with no announcement. It’s almost as if between every release we don’t hear from ANET for a month. It’s almost like the whole month of silence wasn’t an issue, it was just an issue for people to complain about. 
---
We’re the GW2 criticisms right to some extent, yeah. Was anything related to your comment an issue, no.
---
GW1 and GW2 are the best PvP games on the market for different reasons.
---
Anet isn't doing anything with either. It's a shame that nobody in the management cares about PvP.
---
Totally agree. This community has been a shit fest recently.
---
There's no such thing as year 0.

---
If you have a character you want to do WvW with, I'd suggest getting them to 80 and at least exotics. Most PvE content outside of Fractals and Raids doesn't really require a specialized character. So long as your build isn't junk you'll be effective. If you do plan to do Fractals at least, then it'll be worth it to level your PvE character, otherwise doing maps and story is fun and levels you pretty quickly. sPvP though, everything gets scaled to 80 anyway, so there is no point in leveling a character that you only plan to do PvP with.
---
The chain should have some kind of internal cooldown and maybe a bit of randomness but I remember it appearing fairly regularly when I went to the map.
---
It's kind of amazing that accounts like that have been tolerated for so long. They add nothing productive to the sub.
---
So you are telling me, if anet increased the release cadence of living story slowly to 9 months between episodes, only added new story instances and maybe a new openworld event on an already existing map with each episode... all while telling you its because of re-structuring and dont worry... if anet then started talking about "focusing on making esport pvp the best feature of the game"... you would just silently uninstall the game because its not fun to you anymore? No hard feelings about the time and money spend on the game, no disbelief at the 180 turn or hopeful endurance for anet to get back their senses?
---
Your comparison of someone expressing feelings of disbelief and disillusionment with a highly complex mental illness is inappropriate and derogatory. It also shows a clear lack of understanding of what you are even talking about. Do yourself a favor, and dont try to psycho-analyze ever again.
---
GW2’s great community has turned into a whiny and bitchy one really fast. 
---
I think it might be because all of the veteran players don’t see an issue with the current affairs. I think it’s mostly people who normally jump from game to game that is causing the recent toxicity. This is obviously not true for every player and my personal speculation. To go a little further, is there issues with the game, yes. Does it deserve all of this shit talking, no.
---
wrong on both counts
---
Nope, once used on a character, you cannot move the additional bag slots anymore.
---
sHOOT aight thank you bb 💜💜😭

Yeah, kind of like fusion energy. In theroy it could do so much if we could only get it done just right. In practice, however....
---
Lets hope they fit a new eye of the north system and GW3 announcement in there
---
He may of been using one of the many infusions out there to give the Charr the blue tint ?
---
You say that, but these guys are masters at disappointing even the most defeated fans.
---
Ah, sorry.
---
Of course nobody likes internet psychologists. I don't mind you mistaking me for one. I'm talking about genuine behavioural problems.
---
Since I don't study that stuff, I spent ten seconds on google. Here's a link to the .pdf to a thesis: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2872/e88f465fd2b44e8922db29b7ebb030ecb5f7.pdf  
---
Quote of its abstract:
---
&gt;Nineteen studies were included in the review and results are discussed in terms of seven broad areas; Play time, Demographic differences, Psychological wellbeing and mental health, Personality, Cognitive factors, Physiological factors and Gamer experience and motivations. 
---
And some shitty popular psychology about trolls on the internet in general: https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/your-online-secrets/201409/internet-trolls-are-narcissists-psychopaths-and-sadists
---
Both should provide you with ample links to dig deeper, should you actually be interested in the issue.
---
On a surface level we can probably agree that hanging around in a subreddit of a game you haven't played for years just to bash it on every opportunity is not healthy behaviour. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
He already knows so much! I can see it in his words!
---
Also known as moderation. Funny that.
---
How points are made can be incredibly important and there is a lot of stuff that has been on this subreddit that should have been moderated. Censorship is an outright banning of views, opinions and expressions. This isn't happening here from what I can see (note, your post is still here, being a prime example) and instead a point is being made that certain unhelpful and hostile means of delivering said views will be moderated.
---
Given how this subreddit has been recently, that's potentially a good thing.
---
It's not that simple, because this isn't a single player game. Communities like guilds and friend groups drive player retention in a massively MULTIPLAYER online game. I took a "break" 18 months ago. I basically never came back because almost all of friends were gone when things started looking up again (briefly), then surprise surprise, shit quickly went sideways again. Your entire premise is flawed.
---
After much consideration, we will now award 0.5 AP per achievement completed. That way, we can prolong GW2's lifespan for another 20 years! Hooray!
---
I mean, at this point it's more overlord than SAO then
---
This is what people don't get, I play this game because I enjoy the people I play with. And collectively we all play it because the gameplay systems are enjoyable and the content that is there is enjoyable. Now that content is getting drip fed to us at a snail's pace keeping my community together isn't a simple as just going "play something else 4head".
---
Out of my 50 person active guild I would be genuinely surprised if I could even get 10 to move over to a different game together. Everyone has separate tastes and the only thing we can agree on is GW2, but the content isn't there for us to stay around forever. MMOs are driven on communities and this mentality only serves to kill them.
---
Good luck on Xera.
---
Yeh it's pretty usefull to get huge confusion burst at the start of the fight.
---
One of the major signs of decline - authorities starting to punish people for talking that there is decline, history always repeats itself.
---
So basically what you're saying is that you have no proof but it's your belief something is happening? God I love sub mods....
---
here is a log from a pug run i did (so no optimal condition) :[https://dps.report/p96E-20190718-222314\_twins](https://dps.report/p96E-20190718-222314_twins)

I didn't even need to hit play, the thumbnail alone is pure nostalgia. Hit play anyway tho XD
---
mirror pls
---
&gt;You are really showing how strong your arguments are with that strategy!
---
There is no showing you. You are close minded like I said. Me typing to you or trying to explain anything is completely useless.
---
insults, emotional outbursts and assumptions.
---
Good job, you're excused, have a lovely day!
---
Agreed, and if it can be substantiated that that is actually happening, hopefully tthose posts will be treated in the same way and be moderated.
---
However, I'm going to guess that those sorts of posts don't actually happen all that much and instead the term "white knighting" is just wheeled out in a lazy attempt to discredit opposing opinions.
---
&gt;ten trillion hours of repeatable gameplay

Make sure to use the water gun on Lady Wisteria Whiskington. I like to see my guests going 'oh shit! oh shit!'.

Wish you good luck but please eat something while doing the chalange.
---
5 instant repair canister for your character? 
---
for real tho prolly some guildwars2 shirt/hoodie or so, maybe a mug and some ingame goodies like anet shirt or a gem card if i had to guess.
---
So it's not fine to be negative about the game because that's stopping discussion?
---
But when someone makes a constructive thread about what's wrong with the game and people brigade it with "stop being so negative", "fucking leave already", "slit your wrsist already if you're so emo" - those are fine?
---
I really hope they revise the Holo changes, this spec was so fun and fluid to play, now it plays like ass.
---
First off, neither "study" shows any indication for mmos fostering violent behaviour.
---
And did you look at those 19 referenced studies in that thesis paper? The sources, sample size, aim and results of each? Id urge you to do so if you want to feel stupid for linking that '10 second google find", if you want to die in ignorant bliss... then dont.
---
That paper also concludes only that having problems with oneself, with others, with life results in higher addiction risk. What a surprise.
---
But then, the paper you linked me only really wanted to show that there might be a problem and that further research is needed.
---
And sorry, but wtf... psychology today... thats like linking  kotaku. The referenced study itself suggests that internet trolling is a sadistic motivated behaviour limited to the trolling itself, not part of the trolls personality. Again, Im not quite sure why you linked that.
---
And as to your assumption that everybody not agreeing with you has fully quit the game years ago and just visits the subreddit to bash the game, you are actually quite wrong there. I for example am slowly drifting away, but still playing the game when I raid with my static or help out friends. Theres a handful of "trolls" on the subreddit, yes, but sorry to disappoint you there, thats maybe 10 people, and you recognize them pretty easily.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I conclude from this: your statement of mmos fostering violent behaviour or attracting people with violent behaviour issues or even mmos being especially addictive is just something happening in your brain, not actually proven by a study somewhere.
---
At that point they would either have to announce Elite Specs or to introduce different difficulty modes for raids. Otherwhise the raid-scene will be dead after the ERP.
---
Said in a post without a comment section because, sometimes, the means of delivery and the message necessitates clarity. That's pretty standard in communication. 
---
This thread is still here and your post is still here so the criticism and discussion is clearly allowed. Of course it will be a different matter if things get removed but thankfully that hasn't happened yet.
---
I imagine the comments section was locked due to allow clarity of message. This thread and your comments are still here so nothing to worry about (yet).
---
Nothing seems to be suggesting being banned for being upset, just that posts that aren't helpful because of their tone and means of delivery will be moderated. Hopefully the critical messages and negative views are still allowed. It will definitely be something to be concerned over if they aren't though.
---
&gt;so if a streamer watches a video from a known gw2 person on stream which he found on reddit and says: wow that video is good, it should be upvoted then its manipulation? 
---
Upvotes mean the post is relevant to gw2. Is Nike's video relevant to gw2? Yes.
---
Is this a sort of canary in the coal mine comment? When it is deleted or removed then we have an indication of moderation that has crossed the line to censorship?
---
Well, to be fair of the little love that Anet gives to their competitive modes PvP has it better than WvW, since you have your ATs and Ranked Seasons roll around periodically.
---
It'd be so cool if 500 chef required fishing like in RS or ESO style
---
Which I find interesting because I consider myself hardcore after playing for 6 years, thousands and thousands of hours in, and I still find plenty to do logging in. I think the game is "dying" for hardcore *raiders*, but the content Anet releases has kept me perfectly satisfied for many 5+ hour sessions a week for years. All anecdotal of course, but I have no idea where this "dead game" idea comes from tbh
---
I was hoping for Bubbles
---
Well, the changes were alright, but the traitline itself is usually being run by really specific builds with suboptimal, piss poor, or unreliable access to stealth, unless they're just trying to max out their stealth duration, but as far as those niche builds go the trait changes are fairly decent, even if most of them are just utility.
---
On behalf of 40C+ Europe: plz snow
---
People aren't 14 anymore and can't grind 8 hours a day for slow-ass mount or rare gear
---
I never understood that argument. As an adult I now have way more "me time" than I had as a child/teenager. Or am I just the minority with a good life/work balance? School back then finished at 3 or 4, and it was not unusual to spent another 2 or 3 hours with homework. Including Saturday. You had some breaks, but in my country you also get 5 weeks of paid vacation. I do not miss school at all.
---
Also we still know nothing about the DSD
---
Interesting to see the food was from starter maps and lasted one hour. Funnily enough, looks like the Charr didn’t loose any food recipe but the norn lost 2, classic norn hate.

Have fun.
---
Mine got caught by my spam filter so maybe try checking there?
---
The reason people become so negative and vocal is they have no power.  
---
A player becomes invested in the game spending thousands of hours in it, when something happens that starts impacting their enjoyment. They can see the fault, have ideas on how to address it, and on how to make the game in general better for them.  
---
But they can't do anything about it themselves.  
---
They post on forums hoping to reach the developers, but to no avail. The community may even attack them for expressing their concerns and ideas. "This game isn't for you", "If you don't find it fun play something else", "Take a break and play another game". None of that is productive, only making them feel worse than before. But they are still passionate about the game, so negativity builds up against developers and those members of the community.  
---
And when enough players feel this way about a topic, it reaches an outburst like in the recent discussions we've seen.

Welp, it has the best PvP mechanics in an MMO for sure, by a huge margin. And it used to be the best PvP action conquest game for a while
---
But, sadly, it's now basically abandonware when it comes to PvP. Random balance patches, very few valid builds, no new maps or modes, unresolved bugs and problems from 2-3 years back...
---
I'm really sorry I'm the one to say this. I wish you could have found it when it was still properly supported. Hope you still have fun and find the right people to play with!
---
Are there any games where this kind of stuff actually happens outside of cutscenes / scripted sequences? It'd be pretty cool tbh
---
SFX you mean ;)
---
its just gonna be an announcement of gw autochess
---
I just convert them to spirit shards. Cause i use them faster than im getting them. But if not, id say use them for black lion key farm. It took me only 2-3 days to level up to 80 so to use the tomes for leveling up is a waste for me
---
I'm just a few km further south ;)
---
But yeah it sucked. Quite interesting to hear your experience so that argument makes more sense to me, ty.
---
Better blind field.
---
Oh wait...
---
I just will say this...
---
... no Colin, no hype.
---
no one else of the team at the time was in any raiding guild i sure as hell didn't remove any of the kill threads that weren't after the first so could you clear this up for me?
---
Yesss I love Commander Titania's content
---
Again, just because -you- don't like them, doesn't make them any less major of a change on a design level.
---
Its because it's an online game.
---
People hope (in vain) to influence live development. 
---
Community is more important than the content of the game, you can just leave the game but if the game was more about hanging out with your friends, you're actually leaving your friends behind. A big thing in GW2 currently are the negative consequences of the 'leave and come back' culture that the game has had for a long time, because it causes chain-leaving and there's very little coming back because when you come back your friends aren't even there anymore. The band never gets back together.
---
(For me personally for example, it doesn't matter if ANet adds more fractals or raids because I wouldn't have anyone to play them with anyway. And it's very frustrating to try and find a new group of players and all you do is watch them struggle against really easy content.)
---
Zero game preservation so everyone is stuck with the latest patch, unlike singleplayer games. A patch removed something you liked or added something you don't like? Tough luck.
---
Extreme dependency on patch cadence in order to maintain or even grow the playerbase and in order to efficiently sell microtransactions. People are basically conditioned on unrealistic content expectations.
---
People in general are abrasive assholes and will post the opposite opinion just to make people angry, just look at any extreme positivity/negativity thread, it's easy to see which people are actually happy or sad and which people are just there to make others angry.
---
No problem. I'm glad I could give you some insight. :-)
---
1/2:  You can probably just buy some exotic gear on the trading post.  Depending on what stats you want will vary the cost.  Berserker's (power/precision/ferocity stats) is the pretty commonly used and is a good set to try and start with.  Might cost a few gold but should be too expensive so long as you're not looking to do fashion wars just yet.
---
3:  Legendaries are on the same level as ascended, they just have special skins and selectable stats.  You can get ascended armor and weapon boxes just from playing the game in general, with a higher chance from the 5-man level 80 content Fractals of the Mists.  Also if you've been playing and logging in consistantly for a few months you should have some laurels that you could likely use to grab a couple of ascended rings from the Laurel vendor.  For accessories i suggest finding a guild and doing guild missions to get those, as they can cost laurels + 50 globs of ectoplasm, where as with guild missions you can get them for somethign like 12 guild commendations (you can get something like 6 per week?  Haven't done these in awhile but yeah).  You can also do specialization collections in Path of fire/Heart of thorns to get some ascended weapons as well.
---
I suggest using the wiki for many things.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page.  Good luck ^_^
---
There must be something wrong with my eyes, since i still don't see anything.
---
What announcment?
---
Been looking through comments here and on the reddit in general and it has escaped me completely. When will it be made?
---
Given that the logo in the picture is both red and blue my guess (and the guess of many players) is a Primordus *and* Jormag focused season. 
---
It will possibly also integrate with a Norn and Charr focused story and thus be located in the Far Shiverpeaks and the Blood Legion homelands (plus maybe the Woodland Cascades, though that is a bit less certain).
---
It is amazing to play, but horrible to watch. That's the main reason it can't be esport. Nobody watching has a clue what is going on unless you are a high level at recognizing animations.
---
&gt; Can you see who sent the report?
---
Reports are anonymous afaik.
---
YO I DIDNT EVEN THINK OF THAT THANK YOU OH GOD 😭💜💜💜💜

You are absolutely lying to yourself if you believe what you wrote there.

5 weeks of holiday doesn't measure up against school holidays. 2 weeks christmas, 2 weeks easter, 8 weeks summer and some in between. Our school finished significantly later, but 2-3 hours of homework every day wasn't a thing. Altho i'm sure some people spent that time, you can learn to work efficiently.

---
idk, i think its rather obvious its all subjective. i dont need "in my humble opinion" "i think that..." prefixes for every opinion on the internet or irl to know someone is just saying what they think. its how ppl talk, how colloquial language works. what you're saying would apply for official styles of communication and reddit community isn't all about official language (unless its some mod/dev speaking officially ofc)
---
It's almost like you selectively read half of one sentence in the entire post.
---
Their proof comes from people's behavior where their username is displayed, as in comments and messages.
---
The mods should use their power this way, the subreddit has been a trash fire lately. It's the job of the mods to extinguish it.
---
where can i find examples of damage type death animations?
---
you can change how your toon looks and you'll like it again
---
I have been watching this subreddit for two years now and I have seen outrage before. I personally found it extremely suspicious. All of a sudden on a Tuesday because of the announcement of FoT4W? The lack of communication and content resulted to so many extremely repetitive posts that said nothing but old stories? I am personally relieved that this is not what the community has gotten to
---
Everyone saying it's dead but were still getting near instant ques......
---
This is an exception to the rule though and shouldn't be expected the vast majority of the time, it's also a lot easier for your expectations to be exceeded when you don't set them way to high.
---
It also helps that Digital Extremes were a hair away from going bankrupt when they were first developing Warframe. Digital Extremes were so close to going bankrupt that they were forced to get their hands dirty and dive into the community to figure out what Warframe needed, because if Warframe crashed, so would DE. I don't know if DE would be the same if they didn't have such a rocky launch, but it proved to them how much transparency means to a game's success. Their entire philosophy is focused around that transparency, every time I watch the devstreams or one-off streams here and there they do on periscope feels like they're actually talking to their community, it's not a prerecorded script.
---
Yup, you can only get it during Halloween. Which isn't too far away!

I have a lot of factual and on point posts that are downvoted to oblivion because people have different personal feelings of the subject. People definitely en masse downvote because they don't agree, not because it is relevant or not. Yes, they break the rules by that , but who will stop them... :(
---
Can you give a link to that? I don't really recall what you're referring to
---
mirage is more than confusion

Opps i thought you were referring to in game puzzles

The problem is that it is not "low effort" posts that get downvoted, it is posts that people don't agree with.

oh pls. Piss off really. FFXIV got a ton of immersion breaking mounts and no one bats an eye because they are literally just for fun. Most stuff turns out not even that bad as how you make it out to be through prejudice. 
---
I want them to go all out with creativity because for one improvement GW2 has over classical MMOs it comes along with 2 wrong doings. So please. Just let them give us more until we have build up more substance to look forward to as a reward.    
---
Also, look again. Isn't that asuran technology thats used on the glider....?!
---
That is not a good reason. You say clarity yet the way reddit works, the OP is at the very top, the first thing you see and read and only OP can edit it, it does not get buried through pages (which a discussion like this *could* meanwhile the sticky stays above).
---
Because their reaction is incredibly tone deaf and opening the door for heavy handed moderation.
---
Next.
---
Man...why max bag space though? It is not really needed anymore.
---
We got rune and sigil spam removed. We got unidentified gear to drop instead of normal gear. So even after hours of play you should be fine with something like 50 slots. You don't need full size inventory.
---
Even we have 32slot bags that are account bound. 5 slots x 32 = 160 slots. That's more than you will ever need unless you store every trash item ever (ye it happens over time). Just get those big bags and move them around to have them on main characters, and let 20slot bags to be on off characters. Actually clean up stuff from inventory sometimes, and you will be totally fine :)
---
Immersion breaking? SAB has an origin story. Dude pls guys can you stop using immersion so lightly.
---
SAB is literally a thing in the tyrian universe and we had a story involving it.   
---
Maybe you missed it when the first SAB launched we had a kinda backstory for it.
---
Also the inventor of SAB messes up Taimis HoT test chamber with SAB code. Where in the world is an SAB glider not originiated from the story when you literally fight an SAB hologram ape in the HoT story.

Yes the design stays in there forever, won't get much worse after washing it a lot of times. But it also won't circulate air through it and won't absorb ANY liquid. So if I wear these shirts (got two of them because I didn't knew better) I sweat like a mountain goat and it just rinse down my sides.
---
Its such a shit show.
---
When I first heard about the new T-shirt shop taking over the merch (or adding to it) I personally expected some less aggressive designs, which you can actually wear to work or around other non-geeks.
---
Something along the lines like this:

Especially after the the guy behind bangarang asked the community here on reddit what they wanted and this kind of  minimalistic/subtle stuff was requested.
---
And then we also only get women clothes. That's also a bit of a let down.
---
Why not nice designs which come close to the artsytyle of Guild Wars 2 and throw it on male and female T-shirts&amp; Tank tops and maybe some other "normal" clothes I can't think of right now.
---
But maybe I should have checked out their website and shouldn't have hopped for something nice, because it looks like they only do those kind of women clothes with "All-Over" prints on them.
---
Ok, hear me out:
---
Guild Wars 2: Fractal Citizen
---
Sorry but the mods just made a framework of vague rules that allows you to remove or ban any users posting "invalid" complaints. Especially considering the timing of this, do you really think anyone believes it won't eventually lead to abuse and selectively removing opinions that go against the grain?
---
This sub is now a moderation-enforced circlejerk to maintain the delusion that GW2 is doing amazing, just like the forums.
---
What would have happened if the stickied post wasn’t locked and the mod team decided to stand their ground and keep the rule changes? We would be stuck with an ugly controversial thread stickied on the front page unless they remove it and create a new locked clean thread. Back to square one.
---
Again, nobody like to have messy things in official posts.
---
And then the game has bugs in the system, which lead to people falling in a coma irl and unable to log out of the game.
---
A bunch of players try to save their guild mate from this mate by tackling the bug using hacked skills.
---
Elder Dragon minions will most definitely continue to fight due to them being either brainwashed or mindless.
---
If you expect it to be a continuation of the latest Living Season format and you like it, then I think it's fair to say you won't be disappointed.
---
&gt; There's a lot of wrong all around but what I'm particularly calling out is you believing the mods would remove low effort positive comments as they will with negative ones. That's fantasy level. 
---
And a statement like that doesn't require such a hostile response as the one you initially gave. That feeds into the poor environment this sub has had for a couple of weeks now. You have more convincing, and polite and respectful ways, of making the same point.
---
&gt;  There's this bias where low effort positive posts are allowed (comments &amp; threads) even while they break the rules and you can even read it in this very subreddit that the mods don't really know what to do about some of that 
---
I am aware of that. I was one of the people [heavily](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ak9nt5/mod_announcement_regarding_show_off_sunday_and/ef34vmm/?context=3) [involved](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aidi97/hello_rguildwars2_your_mod_team_is_announcing/eeogf4g/?context=3) in the [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aalz27/since_theres_now_a_wave_of_fashion_wars_posts_psa/ecv1kqt/?context=3) [surrounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aalz27/since_theres_now_a_wave_of_fashion_wars_posts_psa/ectgdap/?context=3) Show Off Sunday, and in favour of it, when we had the surge of fashion posts that were just screenshots of the character select screen. I was also involved in the discussions surrounding the low effort posts and memes because I don't think they add anything to the subreddit. That includes needless praise about the game or needlessly and poorly supported negativity. The moderation situation is definitely difficult though I firmly believe low effort posts, even if highly upvoted, should still be removed. A populist low effort post doesn't mean it isn't low effort.
---
&gt; I don't assume you to be stupid so you gotta be lying to yourself if you believe that's how things would operate as they clearly already do not. 
---
I also didn't say I **believed** any such thing that would happen. This is another issue that has been damaging discourse on this subreddit - people seeing what they want to see and then using that to make their barbed points. For example, what I actually wrote was " **hopefully** those posts will be treated in the same way and be moderated", not "those posts **will** be moderated". That is a considerable distinction and by ignoring that, what people say gets twisted and distorted unfairly. You do this again in your comment - while giving a back handed compliment that I'm not "stupid", you immediately retort with the implication that I'm dishonest. Acting like that isn't constructive to this sub being a more truthful, honest and welcoming place where we can actually discuss the game without devolving into personal remarks and incredibly polarised sides.
---
Where do the devs get meaningful feedback? I mean I really wonder. 
---
Because these selective types of moderation seen in GW2 cater to one group, and then only give the feedback of ONE part of the community... And then they're suprised the divide between players gets larger like "??? why does this happen its not how I feel!". 
---
By the sheer amount of traction the other half of gw2 has gotten here in the last weeks, it should be clear that it's more than a few players affected.
---
I'll take any bone they throw at us, but I specially like these kind of bones :D.
---
Oh so a controversial change would be a problem? Maybe it is a controversial change... You're confirming to me where you stand and it is to hide dissent. 
---
&gt;Why does it matter where you voice your discontent?
---
You were condescending in the first place

&gt;Posts complaining about forums warnings/bans or also prohibited.

&gt; FORUM
---
&gt; GAME files
---
mmmmmmhmm
---
Because they haven't straight out gone full forum-nazi immediately doesn't mean they didn't just add a framework that allows them to slowly move towards it. It's very valid criticism even if at first, these posts still stay up.
---
They obviously don't care, and yeah, I completely agree with you.
---
Other games and platforms let you change it for free whenever you want, as many times as you want, and we can't change it even once.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
Changing account name is possible, but comes with the loss (breaking) of some features for example your in game mail won't work as far as i know, if you use the search feature in both reddit and the official forum i rembember some devs explaining this.
---
I think your best bet is buying the skins with such effects because there's some pretty cheap ones.
---
And moderators believe things will get better if they just shove the embers down the carpet.
---
Spoiler: It's gonna burn faster.
---
No it’s not, thanks mate.
---
The controversy threads started days before the festival announcement.
---
&gt; Just wanted to hear your thoughts about Arena Net Account Name Changes.
---
They have stated previously that account names are so heavily coded into their systems that changing them is the absolute last resort for extreme cases. They have changed some names previously in those cases, but they absolutely cannot guarantee that the new name will be fully operational - as in, display everywhere as the new one, receive all mails and so on.
---
Not many single mechanics do, but the combination wouldn't be able to be handled by just 5 people in nearly every fight. Take the new Qadim for example. 3/5 people are already on pylons, whilst the other 2 get every other mechanic. Single down would pretty much always be instant wipe.
---
communitys do not form because people are mindless sheeps, communitys form because they have the same opinion or enjoy the same stuff.  
---
there is no undercover group action going on to manipulate reddit.  
---
social influence can be used as tool to manipulate something, but if you watch the streams the only thing you see is that there is exactly that, social influence and a topic gets more attention from a broader mass.  
---
for example i saw the video through the stream and upvoted the post, but not because of teapot, but because i think the video is pretty good with information.  
---
that doesn't mean that i think what frostball did is a good thing...the right way would have been to talk to the mods first instead of spamming the sub.  
---
manipulation would be a accusation towards teapot that he does that to his followers and fellow gamers out of spite of gw2 which one should be really careful of since that is really not the case. by simply watching what he says you will see that already.  
---
yes, a follower mass can start memeing that it becomes unbearable, teapot said often enough in his streams that people should stop going too wild and we also have the reddit mods to stop such behaviour or make a megathread ouf of a topic if it gets spammend too hard.
---
&gt;Sounds like the moderation team is going full corporate.
---
They're not going full corporate, they just stopped tolerating [actual troll accounts](https://www.reddit.com/u/Petrillss) that unironically do nothing but spam "lol ded gaem" and similiar shit, as is common in next to the entire internet since the 90's. High time this sub stopped tolerating that kind of crazy.
---
Contrary to popular opinion, yes they can and will do it.
---
I don’t even know tbh. But u could be right. Was that hinted at during the WoC quest line in GW?
---
It's not the same with all competitive games. The low player count in pvp is a direct result of the abuse; where in several waves (very much like the current unhappiness towards the game mostly by raiders, we've had mass-exodus of PvP players for example after S5.) 
---
This is quite easy to show too; in mmr based systems the population is related to the breath of MMR. We know they had to lower treshholds for legendary and such repeatedly, because the competitive population shrunk massively.
---
At this stage, if you're a plat player you simply can't find 10 other plat players most of the day, and the game is about stomping new players more than about playing people of your level. Legendary... well obviously not enough there. Gold has several bots running 24/7 doing as good as actual players. 
---
I agree these issues make the problem worse. Unfortunately gw2 is far past a point of saving for a pvp point of view. 
---
&gt; but surely there are enough of you who do take high level play seriously to organise a group instead of blaming anet because it's easier 
---
Not really, and to organise what? Balance? Elitist games where they avoid matchmaking? Pretend we didn't lose almost the entirety of our high-end scene? NA literally doesn't have 250 decent players. EU is pretty close to that point to. That's how dead it is. Compare ratings and players from S5 and see howmany you can still find now. You'll notice almost the entire top end is gone... And it's for a reason. You can blame them for "not organising enough" despite these people actually streaming, organising tournies and playing a lot... But anet ignored it and they left. This community bashed them, and they left.
---
Twitch is pretty damn accurate these days when it comes to game popularity.
---
It didn't go free to play, it's just a good trial.
---
Zealots of the game downvote everything who doesn't fall in line? No problem.
---
Dissent manages to shine out for a few days? Hell is let loose.

Isn't that the colours used when Aurene became an Elder? Same with the new GS related to her.
---
My favorite part is when they responded in other thread that screenshots of map completion/legy craft are considered low effort, but community seems to upvote them a lot, yet they make this whole censorship post because there's been 5+ "drama" posts which were all also upvoted a lot.
---
I think they might in the far and distant future, but sadly, I dont see the option coming anytime soon. You are very optimistic.
---
It's the same ingame, as soon as you bring the topic out.
---
But yeah, it's all trolls and bots from outer space, who come here to disrupt our super-friendly community with their toxic criticism.
---
only the  polayluminescent undulating Infusion, has a effect with Armor Dyes

If those things are so great, then you should be doing these great things, not lazy fetching crap.

What is this, criticism? We don't want spam! Begone, trolls!
---
*The next day*
---
Quaggan funny meme #1256.
---
&gt; just because some streamer said to vote on something, I dont vote on it.
---
that doesn't change anything.
---
a brigade happened, whether you personally participated or not
---
The problem here is the definition of "toxic", a pretty malleable word which can mean pretty much anything.
---
What, you don't like the skyscale collection because of the gold and time? That's toxic!
---
&gt; You want a LGBT soap opera
---
where did you pull this out of your ass from? All they're saying is that there's nothing wrong with this particular gay couple and that if they were straight, no one would be complaining about how "cliche" or "forced" they are.
---
Sorry you're triggered over the existence of ONE gay pair in a video game, homophobe.
---
Oh, so now he's responsible for every single human who happens to watch twitch.
---
Give me a break.
---
You're pretty much blaming gun violence on videogames at this point.
---
The medium is not responsible for whatever their watchers happen to do.
---
I really hope they manage to put out at least one batch of new Current Events between FotFW and the live event. Would also love if they wrapped up Season4 stuff into neat categories as they did with Season3 ones.
---
&gt; Their proof comes from people's behavior
---
That's exactly what I read, they basically are saying that their proof is based on their own assumption on how people behave based on the comments they make.
---
&gt; The mods should use their power this way, the subreddit has been a trash fire lately.
---
Indeed the subreddit has been a trash fire lately...
---
now on android and iOS devices!
---
Of course I feed a negative narrative. Why would I be positive? 
---
NO SHIT HARDCORE PLAYERS ARE FEELING NEGATIVE. It's not rocket science. The question is WHY are they so annoyed; and why are many of them unhappy with how the other half of the population treats them including here? 
---
And that's something you /refuse/ to acknowledge. 
---
Why would I be happy and friendly? Because of the years of non stop "fuck you wvw players, fuck you pvp players, fuck you hardcore players you're all toxic pieces of shit and this game is for casuals?". Sorry I did make constructive posts after desert bl betas and release; after PvP seasons failing miserably, ... And what are the responses? Fuck wvw, fuck pvp, go play another game, this game is for casuals and everything else is afterthought! 
---
Gee well, I wonder why these hardcore players are simply voicing negative discontent rather than fair criticism. Perhaps because we have a circlejerk of players shutting it down with our own negativity consistently... But we'll REEEEEEE the moment they become bitter after years of this bullshit. Who'd have thought? 
---
Nono, the game is doing great and you should be positive and fluffy! Because being told repeatedly to quit this game and go elsewhere by those very players makes you feel warm and good inside! 
---
This subreddit isn't a casual infested circlejerk at all! How dare you even use those words. Ok sure, the only way anything that goes against them sees the light of day on this sub is when the bucket runs over and enough people get fed up - otherwise the "positive all is fluffy attitude" wins over everything. But that's not toxic because it's what I believe and i'm all fluffy and nice and everyone with other opinions is a toxic asshole that should play another game. 
---
Yes; I'm not positive with regards to the game or this community. I have pretty good reasons for that, so do many others. That's why it's currently a pretty popular opinion.
---
&gt;I mean, people that login for a few hours every quarter to play through the LS episode and logout then continue to white knight the game here can't be taken seriously either then.
---
And they've been plaguing the subreddit for far longer, spamming mindless "everything is great" posts after every controversy.
---
Yet that's not against the rules. How fun.
---
Y’all have been holding hope out for some good challenging content for a loooong time. With how these past 2 raid wings panned out, the wait between them, and the fact that shattered observatory came out 2 years ago, Anet doesn’t give a shit about challenging content, you guys are just not going to get any. I hate to say it, but y’all just need to let go at this point and accept gw2 for what it is becoming: a casual game where the devs only cater to casuals, and if you don’t like that then leave. I know that there’s not a lot in the world of MMOs right now, especially not with gw2’s combat but ya gotta accept the direction the game is going in or let go.
---
At this point I would be happy with literally anything to be honest
---
Happy happy happy thoughts  
---
no bad thinking  
---
game is doing fine plenty of content
---
Because of situations like this where the mods would be banning people based on what they upvote / downvote.
---
Yep. So much for impartiality. Here are the rules but if you agree with us then you don't have to follow them :)
---
Tbh, I'm not hyped at all. I'm so tired of short-living maps that will turn into dead deserts after a few weeks or better said living world stuff in general. The game has aged well but I feel that they wont go for any major project inside GW2 anymore. If you see how barren the sale numbers of PoF were compared to HoT you can see that the game is on a steady decline and they are very well aware of this. The last living world story prepared basically everything for a true sequel game and I hope they really go for a new game this time.
---
So I guess we need to write a thesis every time we say something, just to prove our points.
---
Meanwhile, a moderator can claim the subreddit got brigaded by an army of trolls, but they don't need to prove it.
---
that is also not what I said...
---
I remember that,I even spoke with a dev about it. Changing ID will make your mail system not work and make some problems with whispers and guilds.
---
yeah and that mod post is such a fucking joke, it's not even funny anymore
---
If you're platinum + you're unlikely to find a game without a 300+ rating spread throughout 20 hours a day. You can have semi ok matches ONLY on EU for about 4 hours a day. 
---
Balance is BAD. Match quality compared to S5 and previous is ... genuinely depressing. The chance of having 10 players that are capable of playing the game is almost non existant. These issues continue to compound eachother making the playerbase smaller and the issues worse. 
---
The sub as a whole /hates/ pvp. Criticism isn't allowed and hasn't been for years; unless it's memes shitting on pvp. 
---
The situation is simple. Anet doesn't care about pvp. Community is very anti competitive. This has lead to almost the entire pvp community leaving this game. It will never ever be repaired or regained (both because anet won't do anything to make them want to, and because at this point pvp has regressed to a point beyond repair without serious marketting; which they don't have.) 
---
So what I said initially. I'm sure you can find games nearly instantly, we know there are several bots playing at your rating to farm gold that run 24/7... Personally I don't want to play with bots that are quite easy to outplay.
---
I don't see anything. Coudl you draw the outline of the eyes / head shape ?
---
I can’t speak for OP, but max bag slots &amp; bag spaces makes opening Unid gear super easy since I can open more than a whole stack at a time.  I’m currently doing exactly this to collect drop rate data for rare Unid gear.
---
At about ten and two O’clock, roughly where you’d draw eyes if the circle were a face. Glowing blue-green.
---
It's all speculation for now.
---
Holy fuck we losing to Metin2? I've played that for years (cause there are servers specifically dedicated to my country, so it was pretty cool) but that game is the purest form or p2w there is. Damn feels bad indeed.
---
&gt;*We're not gonna have any problems, are we?*
---
Remember that the Commander stood toe to toe with the God of War and got killed... But then got better.
---
It is not, and if you think it is, you might need to re-learn how to understand what you read.
---
They don't need  "thousands of streamers" (I assume you meant viewers) - this post, after being on front page of subreddit for 12+ hours only got roughly 220 votes. You need less than 20 upvotes to reach "hot" on new posts. That's less than 10% regular viewers of Teapot, even assuming they would vote with single account.
---
Return of the Terrormancer &lt;3
---
In WvW maps can fit 200+ people and yes the lag can get really bad.
---
Or the constant stream of "this game is great DAE love it too?" threads, which are always the same thing over and over again, with zero value, the same posters replying with the same responses all the time.
---
For the record, I would be fine if both are moderated. Unfortunately, I don't think it's humanly feasible.
---
I agree /you/ have not said those things. But you won't deny that it happened frequently and for a long period of time to the point of being the status quo on this sub. 
---
And as i've said before; sorry but a LOT of attempts have been made by a LOT of people to nicely provide criticism. At times you're even one of them. And they've been - in nice terms - told to fuck off repeatedly. 
---
You're positively critical of this game. Many of us are past that point, where we realise the community is actively trying to bully us out. I don't know how else to put it. I'm not delusional enough to think this community or the game will change direction. I do think counterweight to this circlejerk is needed, and plenty of people feel this way even if these opinions generally were hidden / burried. Eventually players get fed up - clearly evident from the past few weeks on this sub. 
---
So am I here to change the games direction? I wish but it won't ever happen. Am I here to win you over or change your opinion? I couldn't no matter how I worded it. But it'll resemble with plenty of players regardless of how aggresively toxic casuals downvote anything that goes against their circlejerk. Because no matter how desperately they try to hide it, plenty of other people -not /entirely/ you- feel the same way.
---
And I can't be fucked with dressing up my posts in nice fluffy words so toxic pieces of shit can pretend they're somehow better than everyone else. "Friendliest community" is the best meme this game has produced.
---
It sure looks like a damage control move, which makes the mod team look pretty bad, whether it's true or not.
---
It sure as heck is suspicious that you choose to comment on that specific comment tho, hell he didn't even mention you.
---
cause i was part of the moderator team back then and wasn't part of something like that nor received any message of any of the other moderators doing that so I would like to know what is he talking about. if someone was abusing their power back then I would be annoyed that i didnt notice it
---
I stopped the game because the game forced me so. It wasn't my choice
---
Indeed. They simply said it always happens, but that's not true. Just frequently.
---
Wow? Are you serious? Like its your opinion an i respect that but gw2 pvp system is not bad, its terrible, i stopped paying it because of lack of pvp, joined wow and there if you have war mode activated you can anyone from the other faction anywhere in the world..... gw 2 has 2 gardens where you can fight pvp and even those are.. meh
---
&gt; You're grasping at petty semantics at this point
---
I’d rather be safe than sorry. The reputation of the game can unfortunately be misinterpreted through what is posted here and from an outside perspective, it’s extremely off-putting to see “ded game” posts. It gives the wrong idea.
---
The sooner people learn to be constructive, the better.
---
&gt; We don't need "this message reflects my personal opinion" disclaimers on every post.
---
Tell that to internet.
---
There was already rules for the low effort ones. So why the need to update the rules? 
---
&gt; Complaining/hating for the sake of complaining/hating or just spamming the game and is dying is not content worthy of this sub. Additionally there are many accounts who exist for the only purpose of posting comments telling people to quit the game and the game sucks. These users will now be in violation of this updated rule. 
---
You really going to tell me its not a response to; I don't know, the recent state of the subreddit? And clearly this does the exact same as the official forums. Criticism is allowed as long as we deem it worthy, in vague terms. 
---
Funny how "quit the game and the game sucks" is bad, but "hardcore players should quit the game because it's not for them" has been a low-effort reply for genuine criticism for years.
---
I miss the good old forums. Reddit and modern social media are just a big attention-seeking low-effort circlejerk, where you can't even have a proper long-term discussion :(.
---
Sure, call it whatever you want, I just said you look suspicious attacking this particular comments amongst many others in this secti9ns against the mods, you work that however you want.
---
&gt; "I just love that game so much!" is wife beater mentality.
---
What the hell...
---
Like, its actually so bad, it doesnt even have the option to duel a friend... i still think you joking so i didnt fall for it
---
In this case, Teapot's actions have bred toxicity and encouraged the actions of others. He isn't responsible for the outcome of those actions but an accessory to them occurring. 
---
This is a bit of an aside but society can lead to all sorts of negative behaviours and repercussions - if you want a real world example look at what happens with measures such as austerity, unemployment reduction in social services and the impact that has on things such as knife crime. London under the current Conservative government in the UK is a good example of this. The atmosphere and the environment changed, making those negative outcomes more likely.
---
The world isn't as binary as you are painting it.
---
Amen to this post.
---
I have literally 0 expectations for anything Anet releases and yet I'm still disappointed.
---
I mean... nothing will ever beat the [Sombra ARG](https://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Sombra_ARG) from overwatch. but sure. Why not?
---
Played since beta, loved the game straight away and have always made sure to come back for every big release even though all my friends have dropped off over the years. But these past few months have had me the most scared I've ever been for the future of this game.
---
 I don't care what content we're getting, I just want to know where development is going and where we're going to end. GW2 deserves a solid conclusion to the players 8-9 year journey, and while I obviously wish it would never end, I know it will have to sooner or later. This seems like the best point to start working up to that finale while they complete the rest of the end game rewards and come into full maintenance mode.
---
you are purposefully understanding it the wrong way. when you have no arguments, shut up. I am done with you.
---
&gt; I honestly thought we were getting somewhere and might have a reasonable discussion (you see my constructive points in many other threads) but for some reason you've decided to go back to attacking me? Why?
---
&gt; maybe your access to the subreddit. 
---
That's why :o Are you suprised? 
---
&gt; Do yourself that favour. No one is going to want to try and engage constructively with you when you have an attitude like this, despite how much you claim to want it. 
---
I already clearly stated I'm past having genuine discussion with people who don't want it; and I don't think you do. I'm voicing MY OPINION which will resemble to people who feel likewise and I do not believe I will change your mind. Just like you very well know you won't change mine. 
---
I can literally state the exact same. No one is going to want to try and engage constructively with you when you have an attitude like this, despite how much you claim to want it. 
---
I mean; still refusing to discuss WHY people become bitter or negative while alluding those that are should be removed and not have opinions entirely. Then suprised nobody wants to engage with you constructively with an attitude like this; despite claiming you want it.
---
&gt; Again, we are back to personal attacks. I suggested that the new rules were to reduce toxicity - like how you are currently behaving - **not** the underlying points, criticisms and concerns. If you cannot make that distinction, that is a little worrying. It is perfectly fine to have critiques and a difference of opinions if it avoids things like; 
---
Which personal attacks? Where I say refusing to acknowledge these things lead directly to toxicity - and burrying or hiding it won't fix that in any way? Meanwhile you're directly telling me I'll likely get banned under the new rules because - according to you - toxicity is the people that portray it with no underlying reasons... Yet still refusing to acknowledge that this behavior drives it further.
---
Still fails on a lower level - which most players experience. While GW2 grants easy access (good) because you can run any build and press any buttons and you somehow succeed in open world: this is not healthy on the long run, game feels bland fast.
---
Is that realy a argument? It also works on the other side of the spectrum.
---
I wouldn't call them massive, but yeah, not something that can be done easily, as it is now.
---
Aw man :(
---
&gt;Just so I follow, which updates? The ones to the forums or the ones to the game?
---
Both but this thread is particularly towards the subreddit.
---
&gt;I'm not entirely convinced by that since the criticisms and comments have always been prevalent.
---
Prevalent but burried, not adressed and often responded to very passive-aggresively. "quit the game, fuck wvw, fuck pvp, fuck raids, shouldn't have been added to the game, ..." are also very prevalent opinions; not constructive in any way and imho toxic no matter how PC its worded. The exact reason people with these concerns have consistently felt the need to discuss them through other media because of the prevalent status quo here.
---
On the one hand you say
---
&gt; I'm just hoping that at least a few people stop generating hype out of nowhere after reading this post.
---
On the other hand you say this
---
&gt; Some people misunderstood what I wanted to say. I'm not telling you that you shouldn't be excited about the announcement or the future of Guild Wars 2.
---
???
---
To be fair, on an open world level no MMO is actually that good. I'd argue that GW2 is definitely the best of the bunch open world wise though.
---
They already do it.
---
What analogy would you use to describe people that bash the game from morning to night and, if asked why, tell you they do it because they care just oh so much, and the game basically makes them bash it by not being as good as they image it being able to.
---
I didnt get caught and I am not shifting anything, because I answered the same BS before you even posted yours.   nice try.
---
Nothing short of Cantha can bring me back to this game; every living story episode is a meh 2 hour single player experience.

---
Skill system in GW2 is weak. GW2s movement system is excellent, fast, fluid. But skills and traits are a mess and mostly do damage. Aren't situational, you don't have to choose. There are even "rotations", which indicates that you can tell before a fight in which order you activate your skills. That's not good combat design.
---
Link me a study proving MMOs *don’t* foster violent behaviour. Link me a study proving frequent raid or *elite* endgame content releases have a tendency to increase the playerbase (ever heard of wildstar?)
---
I absolutely hate the FFXIV system. It has a ton of issues. Atrocious queuetimes, people leaving as soon as they see that there's a new person, duty roulette grinding being one of the worst timegates I've experienced in an MMO, etc.
---
Most of the issues you're referring to here with the GW2 LFG can be incredibly easily solved by players making their own groups.
---
&gt;That's why :o Are you suprised?
---
Yes, somewhat actually since, to be honest, your comments are incredibly negative and filled with personal attacks. It is *exactly* the sort of thing that could end up being moderated since there aren't substantial issues being raised and they are very direct and aggressive. Of course I can't ban you but I thought it would be a fair point to try and make you see how you are coming across.
---
&gt; I already clearly stated I'm past having genuine discussion with people who don't want it; and I don't think you do. 
---
Given that I am actually [genuinely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ci9xup/regarding_the_most_recent_mod_announcement/ev5hf2y/?context=3) [responding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ci9xup/regarding_the_most_recent_mod_announcement/ev5hf2y/?context=3) to you in another thread currently, where you haven't made it personal or attacked me, that isn't true and you are incorrect.
---
&gt;  Then suprised nobody wants to engage with you constructively with an attitude like this; despite claiming you want it. 
---
See my point above. I'm happy to chat, as I am doing in another thread, if you'll tone down the needless personal attacks and aggressiveness here. You are still doing it though.
---
&gt; Which personal attacks? 
---
I'm quite tired at this stage. Re-read this thread and the other one where I'm happily talking with you and it should be quite clear what is different between them.
---
&gt; Yet still refusing to acknowledge that this behavior drives it further. 
---
What behaviour is that? Pointing out that you are being toxic and likely to draw the ire of a moderator? It is your decision to respond to my comments in the way you are doing.
---
Damn, 2 things I wanted the most promised to be looked at by the same or different devs no longer around.....
---
Search for armour for your class.  You will see either "Exalted", "Emblazoned" or "Draconic" depending on whether you are light, medium or heavy.  Those are the crafted versions.  They are expensive though so what you want to do is just check the stats and buy a cheaper armour that has the exact same stat level.  e.g. Nika's is the same as Emblazoned but is a fraction of the price.  Not all exotic gear has the same stat level so check carefully.
---
&gt; afaik aar to hw is around 150-200h of pure cancer, tho that depends if you watch cutscenes, read dialogue of how some farmer lost a chicken lmao.
---
How can anyone play this bullshit.
---
Hopefully a lot. The episode would be outside he 2-3 month cadence window (again). If it’s just a map and story, there will be lot of disappointment from a lot of people.
---
&gt; and WvW.
---
Woah... are you on drugs?
---
jokes on them I have A.E.D.
---
They have yet to deliver any of those features. Suns refuge was the closest, but immediately abandoned.
---
There's a difference between being passionate and using love as an excuse for abuse, so yeah, pretty bad analogy. Blind love isn't any good either, if that's what you understand for "true love".
---
You think football fans who shit on their team every time they lose do it because they hate it? This is the same exact thing.
---
Dont blame the system if the fault is in its players.
---
Majority of playerbase are snowflakes and people who dont bother reading guides about anything, arent using decent builds or just dont know basic game knowledge (such as using keyboard to cast skills, what's dodging or what's cc).
---
If you struggle with getting into something, make a group in lfg, make a guild and advertise it everywhere. If you're not willing to organize people that are in same situation with you then why do you expect others to do the same? 
---
People put high requirements in groups because they don't want to play with said type of players. People dont play dungeons because fractals are the 5 man end game content, dungeons dont fill that niche anymore so there's no need to focus dev time on them. If people liked dungeons they would play them, they are already rewarding enough if you know how to do them.
---
Yep, it just needs to be adjusted to GW2. Seems like people are already getting something wrong or can't see the benefits of such a system. It's through and through better than the current toxic bullshit we have currently for said reasons.
---
Can we stop talking about “balance”. Things get nerfed and buffed making certain build stronger and weaker at different times. No game has ever achieved balance. I rather have real build craft than imaginary balance.
---
The original Halo trilogy had a lot of great situational interactions. For instance, if you kill an elite commanding a bunch of grunts, the grunts will panic and run. Jackals hide behind shields, and sometimes if you break those shields, they may cover their heads and run. Elites and Brutes had the ability to berserk, and depending on the situation will either panic or run at you if you catch them with a sticky grenade.
---
I think that's my biggest complaint with MMORPGs, is that damage is a number, rather than a real thing. Whereas games like Halo are able to have really unique interactions based on immediately consequencial situations, games centered around health bars tend to be more scripted and lose a bit of that dynamic, authentic feel.
---
mmos are simply expensive to make, thats all
---
you wouldnt run out of content if there would be new stuff coming out every month but that would be expensive for the studio
---
telling people to play slow is just so dumb - people consume as they need to stay happy not to not run out of content, lel
---
Because they are poorly written romance in a game that's not about romance. And yes, I'm "homophobic" when I said the exact same thing about Logan/Jenna. Try to actually read for once instead of throwing insults. Are you going to call me alt right next because my opinion is different from yours?

---
So people can make plans on how to attend it.
---
This game has the best combat among all MMORPGs, imo.
---
It's so infuriating the content is almost never up to it.
---
Whoa so content can never have any relationships unless it's a literal romance novel? What a hot fucking take.
---
Sooo, exeprienced players **should not be allowed** to use lfg to play on a level they are comfortable with? If the only requirement that I can expect in lfg is that players I get from there have ascended  (exotic? regardless of stats and proper upgrades?) gear and killed the boss once (which boss shouldI ask for in full clear run?), then I would have to be **very** desperate to use such lfg. I would rather use external sites, like people did before. Or just not play at all outside of my static. 
---
It might kinda work better with a game with vertical progression, where  having finished *current* boss and having *current* gear means something, but not in gw2.
---
So what analogy would you use to describe people that bash the game from morning to night and, if asked why, tell you they do it because they care just oh so much, and the game basically makes them bash it by not being as good as they image it being able to.
---
There's nothing relevant about it.
---
because they don't even believe that it doesn't belong here, they just don't want dissenting opinions voiced and if they are too obvious about it then they will get more backlash than they have already received, it's not exactly hard to make a new sub and if this one becomes too much like the official forums then people will just stop coming here and the mods realise that.
---
I did that.
---
Then when I came back my entire friend group was like "hey we're gonna move to ffxiv, come join us!".
---
Player retention is a big issue, if my social group is gone, what reason do I have to return to an MMO alone?
---
How is that a argument though. It feels it's an answer to a question no one asked. But it in no way disproves anything that was mentiond in the post. Thtas what a argument would be.
---
ANet already tried this with Scarlet and, ya it was arguably the worst content/story in GW2's history.
---
I think it goes deeper than that. From the moment GW2 was released, there has always been a group of very dedicated hardcore players who tried to play GW2 the same way you played other MMOs. This sub community attempted (and still tries to) to nudge the game towards the classic MMO model. That's what the OP 6 years ago got mad at. 
---
This sub community had its victory right after the HoT launch. For the others, this time was remember as the post HoT content drought. It was not pretty and the game bled players like mad.
---
Yes in the early days if you played GW2 3 hours a day it was perfectly possible to "finish" the game and completely run out of things to do (+ farming gold was lame), but that's definitely not what the OP was complaining about in the thread.
---
Played Chrono since beta but please tell me more. Your balance suggestions are retarded.
---
My biggest fear is that they moved a load of devs off other projects back onto GW2 and put all of them on Living World while keeping the WvW/PvP/Fractal&amp;Raid teams tiny.
---
Low tiers (t4/t5) have lower population so it's less likely to get ran over by zergs.
---
Oh, absolutely. Cryptic hints in New Krytan hidden away in published concept art. Stuff like that. Yespls.
---
That would be badass. But I still don't just want Jormag to be the next big thing we turn our attention toward. Hopefully this will just be the start of us addressing some core Tyria stuff, all over the place. Idk, I'm gonna try not to think about it too much.
---
He’s not he left the company voluntarily so that he could spare some of his colleagues from getting the Axe
---
The think is, it's really short-sighted to look at those gamemodes as just the product of who plays them. I don't really have any insights into WvW, but these 3 gamemodes provide practically the entire representation of GW2 on twitch so they act as a kind of marketing for the game.
---
In addition, the expertise gained from the fractal/raid team does not stay there - the wintersday freezie raid came from them (or at least was polished by them), and there are multiple story bosses that would not exist otherwise: Balthazar and (Istan) Amala were created with assistance from the team, and the Torment of Kralkatorrik boss fight is fundamentally a reskinned Conjured Amalgamate.
---
Regarding PvP, the game mode has at times been thriving - seasons 4 and 5 pulled in a huge number of players.
---
The thing is, having healthy hardcore gamemodes is good for the health of the game in general even if 90% of players never set foot in them. And to be sure, I'm not saying that focus should have been moved off living world, just that a couple of more devs on each team would be a real shot in the arm.
---
Thats still an answer to a question no one asked...
---
I thought about that but I disagree, right now all you have in LFG is a mix of CMs, not CMs all this would do is effectively separate them into their own groups. As I understand your point I personally don't think it would decrease the population more or increase times since, and also with T1 being in place I think (or hope at least) that more people would get into raiding since they have an easy starting point.
---
Having an auto-lfg tool doesn't mean you can't make an static group the usual way.
---
And people rarely play outside their static group anw so this proposed change doesn't even affect them that much.
---
Only problem would be when a static group is missing a person, said group would not be able to ask for an specific haircut style like they are used to and would be forced to take a random with somehow pasable characteristics instead or look for the person they desire via guildies or friends list.
---
It's a small inconvenience for those very demanding or sectarian people but a huge improvement for GW2's community over all. I believe it's worth it.
---
It looks like an unnecessary reason for fragmentation of an already small of dedicated players.
---
I can understand the point for an "easy mode" and normal, but 4 tiers and all those details would only make people want to search for their specific experience without even engaging the content.
---
&gt; Not gonna play advocate games
---
A bit too late for that, don’t you think? Not providing evidence to open accusations is the core definition of stirring up drama.
---
Tier 1 might be a training zone
---
Tier 2 will be full of people "who did it on tier 1", most likely with underperforming gear and skill level. If someone will do gutted version of boss, that don't mean it's skilled enough to do real one. 
---
This won't really change how people are prepared. 
---
Tier 3 - half empty 
---
Tier 4 - deserted.
---
Not sure, but for what you are asking about (open world messing around) you don’t need long boom duration you need burst damage. IIRC the basic idea behind the build is simply “push 1-2 buttons and get all the boons”. This lets you steamroll 99% of open world content. It’s not a raid build for sure but for messing around with a hammer scrapper it works fine.
---
I always thought that GW2 had the best systems to support world PvP of all the games out there.  The way they handled scaling, gear and power curves would have made for amazing opt in faction based pvp servers.  I do think the ship has sailed though on pvp, they really don’t do many updates beyond wvw and even that is lackluster.
---
I like this idea!
---
The concept of LI/LD/KP requirements would still exist.  
---
And a gutted boss helps you to get to know the mechanics.  
---
CMs are already hardly seen in LFG so yes it would be half empty.  
---
And yes I'm also aware that nearly no one would do T4 except hardcore guilds internally, therefore not using the LFG. But it might give some people a sense of progression and are going to pug T4.
---
Like they did with Joko in gw1? Trapped him under a stone because Ossa could not kill him?
---
I'm running Arch with a GTX 1070 without any problem thanks to the nvidia-dkms package. 
---
Ubuntu on the other hand was horrible
---
From lurking on the SC Discord, my understanding is that they aren't being done since they can stir up needless drama regarding profession viability or similar.\*
---
People know where to find the metrics on the website and the discussion is often better on the profession sections on the SC Discord anyway. The resource that SC provides doesn't become less helpful just because there isn't a reddit post.
---
^(\*(Or if it is myself, getting annoyed at all averages being pretty 000 numbers and the lack of average logs!))
---
With any other MMO I would have agreed. However, GW2 is not a regular MMO. 
---
In any other MMO the endgame is based on group instances. So every player from the most novice to the hardest hardcore knows that their routine will involve playing a dungeon or a raid, at the difficulty level that corresponds to their skill level.
---
In GW2 the open world is a majority of the endgame. What most  people do for their routine is the "grand tour" (hopping from one meta to an other) or simply farming maps like BFF/SW/DF to death.
---
For your proposal to work, you need to get all of these people doing grand tours or map grinds to abandon what they do and get into easy mode raids.
---
No way they'll do.
---
This would be most disappointing, though. I, for one, don't want to start all over in a tangentially related MMO. I want GW2 to receive active development for as long as reasonably possible.
---
Not going to work. The target population for this new T1 raid is already doing open world metas and these players are extremely unlikely to abandon their routine for T1 raids.
---
Aparently MMO is dying since the begining. Next year It is my time to post "MMO is dying"
---
Nope read the mod post. You’re putting words and twisting the narrative. Then come back instead of raging at me.
---
&gt; You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself,
---
lol some of the fanboys in this sub are in such denial
---
NA sorry!
---
And yet the commander is still controlled by clicking, backpedaling side stepping confused and fall damage dieing casuals.
---
The mobs know my dude
---
So would tier 2 be a safe bet do you think?
---
You're arguing with a mod, fyi. They can disable their tags when replying
---
no thanks, I raid weekly, and I don't want to deal with all that junk.  One difficulty setting is nice and simple.
---
I'm aware.
---
I dunno. That population really wants to raid, but either can't raid (due to being bad) or won't because the rewards per hour of PUGging is terrible (due to other players being bad).
---
PvP
---
It's blatant censorship and the only reason you don't see it is because you agree with it.
---
I mean what's even your point? That if people start being engative about the game it'll "infect" the playerbase? I'm told GW2 has no problems whatosever and it's perfectly alive, so what are you afraid of? If the game is indeed fine, it'll fall on deaf ears. Or maybe, just maybe, there's something wrong and that's why people were agreeing with it? Pick your narrative please.
---
You realize there's a pretty high chance of there being a new demo, right? Data-mined files from the past several months have been hinting at it consistently. Maaan, just let people be happy and speculate. The community could use some positive vibes right now.
---
Boy you're projecting so hard right now.
---
Yeah I meant it like that. You have to clear each boss once on a tier to unlock the next tier. What I meant by this is that once you HAVE unlocked all bosses, you couldn't pick if you wanted to do a mixed wing with CMs and normal modes, you'd have to pick CM wing or regular. That was my point. And that's why I added this is a negative point later for experienced players. Simply maybe adding to select the encounter itself instead of the whole wing (once you've already cleared them)
---
The travesty is that Anet gave up on PvP after suffering from toxicity... Toxicity is everywhere, especially in this game mode..
---
&gt;"The downvotes have won. No hype allowed!"
---
Yeah, that is something I wasn't sure about either. I think best deal is, when a new wing releases and you have cleared previous wings on T2/T3 you unlock the new wing immediately on that difficulty. I like your idea with the Learning Mode!
---
I can't find anyone to raid with as is. Fuck this.
---
I see what you're saying, but by that logic, I guess we can just give up on elite specs altogether for revenant, right?
---
Look at warrior. It already had burst capabilities, and Berserker just pushed that further. It already had decent crowd-control, Spellbreaker just pushed that further and into a more PvP-centered niche.
---
I guarantee there are things rev could improve on, or even just new playstyles for existing combat strengths. This is where creativity shines.
---
Without the "show details", we really don't know much else besides your game crashed.
---
Mainly that Kalla is the renegade spec she lead the charr which were suppressed from the flame legion, in elona the ppl were suppressed from joko/balthazar. so to a certain extent it is fitting
---
We're going to get something completely irrelevant to the setting, or only relevant to past expansions/living world.
---
Glint had prominence in LS2. So we got Glint in HoT.
---
Kalla had prominence in HoT, so.....
---
Okay, fuck it.
---
Careful now,there be furries prying in the dark...
---
Duty finder was just an example. Of course it need adjustments. But its not build entirely on the trinity system. You can easily convert the fundamental and port it into other games. For example, give players the option to choose what they are. Trolls get punished.
---
\&gt;  So basically pug/semipug fullclears get deleted and everyone will **have to accept** additional organizational time     
---
Read further please. 
---
\&gt;  If we get to a certain amount of raids full weekly clears won't be possible for the majority of players anyway
---
Even tearing it down, you will be disappointed. 
---
Those of us on the forums and here on reddit _are not the core players as determined by their metrics._
---
I've seen this show. It ended poorly.
---
It is not a new logo, it is the living world logo just colored differently
---
you do not understand.  
---
i queue as chrono tank for lets say matthias.  
---
lfg needs to know: there is no tank for matthias.  
---
it needs another chrono to be effective.  
---
if there is a heal thief queuing in, he shouldn't be put in my group because he can give boon alsone.  
---
it also needs to know that this heal tief has no alacrity and another player, for example revenant needs to give it to the group. this can be done by a condi build, but also by a heal...but absolutly needs to be a renegade, if someone queues in as herald it doesn't work.  
---
what if people troll? what if people change their build? who is the leader of the group? does this one even wants to be the leader?  
---
way too many variables which have to be controlled.  
---
on leagoe of legends this works, because its always the same setup. 1 solo top, 1 solo mid, 1 jungle, duo bottom. they can interchange lanes, the champions can vary...but the initial setup never changes. this setup came from players...and riot did adapt it into their system. so they can't make any changes to the "how its supposed to be played" without changeing the lfg too.  
---
this is exactly how gw2 changes all the times.  
---
we came from 1 chrono + herald to 2 chrono, 2 druid, 2 warrior setups to 2 chrono, 1 warrior, 1 druid and now there is firebrigade, some groups love to paly with 2 healer, some with 1...  
---
...how is the system even supposed to know what a kiter is and if that person can even do this job with whichever class he logs in there.
---
Living World logo always been like this.
---
Make the instabs fun and rewarding like Halo Skulls and I'd force my guild to turn all of them on for every single raid.
---
Oh sorry, give me a second.
---
No, look at the logo for season 3 and season 4, it's the same shape, just palette swapped. That's supposed to represent a planet, because it's the living world
---
The main issue I see from this is that it introduces mechanics that distract you from the real fight. Instead why not just make the mechanics already in the fight more dangerous. When I did air cm in Wing 7 I was expecting the lasers to 1 shot. But it does exactly the same thing in cm. You could make it do more damage, down the person, etc.
---
They already have cm as an alternative gamemode for most encounters but once you do them once you get nothing for doing them more. Why no give it more rewards so people actually do them more than once? I don't see why we need another system. It's just gonna make it more complicated for new players.
---
i loved gw2 too. i was really committed to it for years and had  even some playing period where i would play all day every days. having done everything except few raids and legendaries i finally faced an enormous hole.
---
a hole of emptiness where i had to find people to RP in towns,j buy and have fun wioth in game toys and tonic or roam with people in WvW because i had nothing to do in the game that was appealing anymore.
---
so i took pauses, from several weeks to several months and came back each time a new significant update came out.
---
but after a while i realised that gw2 wasn't the game i loved anymore. not in the sense tha
---
no drama, he just grew disinterested and wanted to move on from the game and focus on irl stuff
---
I would prefer if the challenges were additional mechanics based on each encounter (like KC's spirits walk faster) and not a general one as you've proposed. Apart from that this idea sounds good, provided that they give rewards that feel fair for completing these higher tiers.
---
I don’t raid because of the time commitment, I used to be a mythic raider in WoW for a few years until BFA and can tell you those days are forever over, no way I’m gonna waste my life away on wiping on progression raiding again.
---
Honestly wouldn’t mind pure matchmade raids, same exact loot as standard raids but an easier version, just 2 tiers; same loot. That would boost the pop immensely.
---
If anything should be scrapped it’s stuff like CM’s that barely a drop of players experience, that money could be spent better elsewhere.
---
TLDR; design raids for the majority who are obviously not raiding for various reasons, time and organizing being major ones.
---
2 dificulty modes as we have now should be enough, just make nm easier if you need to and make cms harder (and repeatable).
---
Keep in mind bag slots are likely to go on sale here in a few weeks as part of the anniversary sale (as will char slots hopefully).
---
Existing characters can be used as storage banks for infrequently used stuff, parked at places for free loot (end of JP, tombs, rich nodes, etc) but dont forget they get birthday presents every year as well for level boosters you'll never use, dye kits, tele to friend.
---
try it without the mod?
---
Cant overhype smth they havent said anything in particular about.
---
[Fucking finally](https://media.giphy.com/media/1Z02vuppxP1Pa/giphy.gif)
---
In terms of daylie viewers
---
Here's a weird thought: 
---
How about for T4, we completely lock out a random trait line, Maybe even per class
---
Probably a little harsh for w hole tier, but it might be fun for a Event week or something…
---
I really really reaaalllly like the idea. However this is exactly what anet opposed to and honestly rightfully so. This system would split the playerbase. Yes, new blood will have a entery chance and more casual. However with this kind of system, tier 2 would be skiped almost entirely. People would just “git gud” and try to do weekly tier 3. Idk about tier 4, if one of the temps would be something like “33% slower movement speed” then even tier 3 would be skiped. Again, I like the idea, but it’s not a good idea to split the playerbase. 
---
HOWEVER, same system except 1 tweak, tier 3/4 are monthly. If it was 2 things would happen. First, no playerbase split. Secondly, it would encourage people to “git gud”. “Okey bois we did our weekly so what we gonna do now?” Says xhamstter.1234. “Lets do some tier 3 progression” lememelord.6969 responds. I guess thirdly, it’s 1 extra li/LD per month which is, whatever but still nice, the unique drops would be the real reward.
---
it is, but it's so unfriendly to newbies and playing against condition gives me cancer (both ingame and irl)
---
What about... no? What about players actually spend 1 hour to learn the encounter mechanics and actually do them? What about Anet release new raids in a faster pace?
---
I just finished the PoF story.  I'm going to start LS4 soon.  Is the griffon worth going after first before starting LS4, or does it get replaced with the Skyscale as you progress through LS4?  I wouldn't mind saving the 250g to help fund my first Legendary, but mounts are pretty amazing too, and they are all a little different.
---
I like the idea of tiers. Choosing instabs is not cool cuz there will be an easier one present always. Amke tier 3 weekly Cms and add Cms for all bosses. Make tier 4 Cms but with less number of ppl (maybe 8 instead of 10)
---
I recommend this wiki users gear guide has a ton of great info on gearing up.
---

---
A special event you say
---
Not going to solve anything.  The issue has always been getting 10 like-minded people together for more than 45m.
---
Yeah, I had one of the highest LI counts on Gw2efficiency, but I basically stopped raiding entirely once I got a full-time job because as fun as raids are, there's no way I'm going to spend that much time unrewarded. I mean, I could spend the job money on gems to make up for it, but no.
---
because those types of comments are heavily upvoted whereas anyone trying to speak logic has been downvoted...
---
and it's been the case in the last few weeks or so, which is why mods have had to step in, even if I think it might be too late
---
The act of playing pvp is nice but the repetitiveness of conquest and the shaky balance does spoil the fun sooner or later.
---
Ben works for minecraft now.
---
The DX12 mod is known to crash a lot in sPvP. Really risky to use outside of PvE.
---
You only have that issue with D9VK or also with pure wine? I used to have the same problem with my old AMD 5770, but it works perfectly fine with Nvidia 1070 now.
---
I would keep CMs separate from the Tiers themselves. Mostly the same otherwise as what you said.  3 tiers being: Story, Normal, and then Hard.  For the Hard tier, buff boss in different ways, or do what OP said with having the challenges you could activate optionally that increase loot chance for each one active.
---
For the CMs, keep them as a separate option, but they can only be activated on T2 and T3.  Make the CMs repeatable, but after the first completion of them, they would double the gold reward, and give you a minor loot chest that's a downgraded version of the original CM reward.  So you'd still be able to get the food and utility rewards, but you would get a max of 5-10 butternut dishes instead of 50.  So it still has extra incentive for regular raiders to do them. You could break even on food weekly, or come out slightly ahead if you are 1 shotting your kills.  It (probably) wouldn't kill the food prices too much, but it would give experienced raiders free food that they're usually dropping a good chunk of their reward money on as things currently are.
---
thats all nice and such and that idea comes up every week but anet appears to refuse to give it to us
---
Current raids are for casuals too hard and for seasoned players too easy. Casuals have no starting point and no idea to progress. This system would solve this entirely.
---
Shouts?
---
This is a great rework! I like how similar it is to Fractal Tiers. A++
---
haha gave me a good chuckle, can't wait for the rest.
---
Good job.
---
No, they get unlocked in the achievement pannel. Exception is when you have to do something with that item, then keep it.
---
It's funny how from a fresh eyes perspective gw2 pvp is so great, while from any veteran perspective it is trash.
---
Meaning, the problem isn't the game mode itself but rather other factors, like balancing for example. 
---
Anet's track record when it comes to pvp balance is horrible to put it mildly. Let's not even talk about pve balance, does that even exist.
---
you want HD
---
you buy gemstore
---
For a second I thought this was a trick to make me stare at nothing.
---
that table isnt even there anymore to begin with...
---
Nice, thanks.
---
There's no simple answer, though many would say that investment in defensive stats is a false economy. Marauder gear (Power, Precision, vitality, ferocity) is probably the most efficient method of increasing your survivability through stats.
---
As a general note for open world, sacrificing power for precision to reach 100% critchance is not recommended.
---
&gt;Casuals have no starting point and no idea to progress.
---
Isn't that what guilds are for? At least that's the way how newbies are introduced into raiding in every other raiding MMORPG that I'm aware of. You usually don't start raiding in LFG, that surely won't end well.
---
&gt; This is what raids need
---
This is the complete opposite of what raids need. OP's "challenges" are just Fractal instabilities, which I feel most everybody agrees are completely unnecessary annoyances. The primary problem with raids right now is that the player base is too low. This tiered system ran stale in Fractals and it would completely cut experienced raiders off from anyone trying to start raiding and it would not help bring in new raiders whatsoever.
---
What raids need is a wing designed to incorporate new players. Call it Wing 0, send every character a letter at level 80 telling them about it (like how you're introduced to dungeons), put heavy emphasis on the fact that it's for entry level raiders and balance it around the base game and core professions, not expansions elite specializations. It's not technically an easy mode, but the power creep of expansions and constructing it around simpler mechanics would give new raiders a starting point to begin learning.
---
Hey I drew this. Can you please remove this post? While I appreciate that you sourced me, you didn’t ask me before reposting.
---
It's on the table with the 4th dye slot for raid legendary armor
---
&gt;Okay, so tell me you're one of the players that hosts raid trainings regularly
---
I do actually. Or I used to. Now I've been barely logging into the game.
---
But training others is not the player's duty. We do it when we have time and *want* to. The person who wants to raid should go after the learning they need. It's not others job to hold hands with the newbies to teach them everything. If they don't search what they need because it's too hard or they can't be bothered, it's not anyone's problem but their own. 
---
As the raid scene is right now I have no wish to participate anymore. Hours to form a pug that can't kill samarog? No ty. And don't say that I didn't do my part, because I used to be one of the most enthusiastic trainers in NA. 
---
But there's NOTHING from Anet's part. Players can't do everything. 1 raid every 12 months? Really? Spare me.
---
Thing is, Twitch representation doesn't mean much for revenue generation for Anet.
---
People keep talking about how Anet needs to do stuff for the hardcore community and rah rah but in all these years those communities have been super insular and I would love to see what the conversion rate is for how many new players they supposedly brought to the game.
---
GW2 has always been a super casual game. They've made so few efforts to push for that kind of content or community that I think it's safe to say it was never their target. Evey once in a while they would dip their toe into those waters. Considering how long the game has survived and how the studio survived the bomb they got hit with at the start of the year, I'd wager this isn't a "short-sighted" approach.
---
This is coming from someone who likes to raid+cm, does t4+cm regularly, Platinum+ pvp, and WvWs. 
---
The only justification I see for them trying to do more Twitch appeal is that it's not any worse of an idea than Kung Fu Tea or the car giveaway, so it's right up their alley in the sense that it's a mostly fruitless marketing campaign :V
---
I know your post wasn't getting into all that but yeah
---
Also with pure wine and other dx9 translation layers. It seems to be a problem with the amdgpu driver...
---
I think I had it working some time ago (more then a year) but i don't remember how I did that
---
&gt;  if you let people pick them then it will just be the exact same ones, ie the easiest ones, every time.
---
An easy fix to this would be exponential rewards.  Say there are 5 instab type things, 2 are easy, 2 are pretty damn annoying to deal with, and 1 that pushes things over the top.  Have the rewards scale with the difficulty.  So for instance:
---
Easy Instabs: You get 1 additional loot roll per instab.
---
Medium Instabs:  You get 3 additional loot rolls per instab.
---
Hardest instab:  You get 5 additional loot rolls per instab.
---
If you combine them, say 2 easy and 1 medium.  It gives you 6 additional loot rolls (2 from the easy, 3 from the medium, 1 bonus for having all 3).  And then if a madlad group managed to beat it with all 5 on, they'd get a guaranteed encounter specific reward of their choice. To make sure it wouldn't kill the value of the infusions, have the additional loot rolls from all instabs have a reduced chance for encounter specific rewards.  It gives incentive to learn how to do it with all of them active, but not to the point where it's always expected to be able to do all of them.
---
Bonus: Have all instabs on and CM active (for those applicable), and it gives you 2 guaranteed encounter specific rewards, 1 random and 1 chosen.
---
&gt; As a general note for open world, sacrificing power for precision to reach 100% critchance is not recommended.
---
Is this backed by some numbers? I run some Assassin's gear over Berserker's on my Herald for casual play to get from mid-90% to 100% because I assumed it was better.
---
Yeah but what are the chances of a second resurrection?
---
&gt; It wasnt an open accusation, didnt mention any names at all
---
You don’t need to mention a specific name to be accusations you know. It can be directed at a group of individuals, in this case the mod team. Regardless:
---
&gt; he is the one who found himself in what I wrote 
---
... you kinda voided that by saying “speaking of the devil”. Don’t try to diminish your responsibilities here, you were quite transparent in your message and what it was aimed at. You doubled down *twice* without the shade of a doubt.
---
IWHBYD but in GW2
---
The PvE playerbase wanted it to fail, so they made it fail. All those pesky comments 24/7 with respect to e-sports and price money for competitive GW2 live tournaments...I haven't forgotten. And they were successfull.
---
https://img.memecdn.com/skyrim-bandit-logic_o_1311767.jpg
---
True, but at least you have somehow the ability to understand why X happen because Y pops up... Generally XD
---
I remember reading somewhere that something like... 60%, maybe even more... Don't remember that well, of people watching LoL do not even play it.
---
And that's a game with 4 skills, 1 passive and some items that 90%of the time are the same for every role.
---
Even if we players have trouble following what happens during a fight... Or getting bored while you watch someone rotating points, think of what a non player may get out of that XD.
---
Wait, CoH? City of Heroes?
---
yeah remember the WvW mount announcement fiasco lol
---
That last panel.... Eyes facing us, mouth facing the side.
---
What horror did you bring upon this land.
---
Ok
---
A fractal-like tier system for raids sounds neat actually. Especially implemented this way.
---
In Australia I think school started at 8:30 or 8:10 and ended around 2:30 / 2:45, but a few years ago after I had finished school I heard that they were changing the end time from 2:30 / 2:45 to 3:30 or something. You were expected to spend at least an hour on homework each day but that largely depended on how your parents felt about that and if they decided you had to do it or not, a lot of kids didn't and either just didn't do it or did it very quickly when they got to school. Either way, I did not know many people whose parents would allow them to spend all their free time on video games or watching TV.
---
Something beautiful I lovingly refer to as the “Crapmander”
---
No summons....
---
Anet: Hold my [Jug of Friesson's Ale]
---
&gt; As a general note for open world, sacrificing power for precision to reach 100% critchance is not recommended.  
---
as a general statement this is absolute bullshit.
---
devs clearly stated that there might be no consequences in one case, and the next case the account is irreparably broken
---
So you're saying it's not the players duty to train beginners, why not introduce an easy mode that can be done by 10 players with no experience and teaches them the mechanics?
---
1 raid every 12 months? The longest we had to wait was 10 months so far. Yes that is long. I agree.
---
By wasted potential, people mean that there has been very little attention given to PvP by developers, definitely less than it deserves. Automated Tournaments and monthly AT are great, but those should have been implemented waay earlier, and beside that PvP had gotten 0.5 of a new gamemode (yea, did you know we have another dota-style game mode in PvP?) and a couple of new maps.
---
Instead ANet is pushing for single-player PvE mode developement. Such a waste...
---
Except they openly said they want to bring us expansion-like goodies in the LS. It could happen now.
---
&gt; Hammer is not a legend. Yet.
---
xD
---
I would get the griffin if I were you. I love the thing, and it doesn’t get replaced by the sky scale. It’s super fun and IMO worth the 250g
---
Your proposed system slows down clears regardless of the amount of raids. Even if we get to the point where fullclear won't be possible (thats a big *if*, it would take at least 2-3 more raid wings and with the current release cadence...), having to reorganize a group after each wing or even each boss would be much, much slower. 
---
Not an argument at all.
---
My idea for ez mode raids. Make players able to join the raids with a full squad instead of just 10 man. Simple and ez. People love to join for legendary bounties even if they suck and don't understand the mechanics like having to go in melee to expose weakness etc, others more experienced do the mechanics, and eventually the newer people will learn through repetition without feeling stressed about doing mechanics. They will be confident instead. Maybe.
---
Right, then i misunderstood his question. My bad.
---
Shiro is more fast and many hits kind of dps, we don't have a *melee* hard-hitter (yes, there's hammer but it's ranged).
---
Yeah pretty much, like I used to watch Starcraft streams. I have no idea how to play at even a *beginner* ranked level, but damn if I don't understand enough to enjoy watching pros do it.
---
You could look to join a linking server (lower population such as Devona’s Rest) so every 2 months you are linked to a new, linked server. Most T1/T2 servers will be populated enough to support at least 2 zergs in the NA timezones.
---
My other suggestion is maybe find a guild that is dedicated to doing that kind of thing. There are guild who run small enough with full intention of havoc and pissing off the enemy. But you also will get a response from the enemy eventually no matter what tier or server you are on.
---
Generalized you can sort of say:
---
Toughness will reduce the amount of dam per hit, useful if you get many small hits. But getting hit by a boss mob for 2500+ damage per hit and getting 100 pts off is less impressive.
---
Vitality will give you a bigger healthpool which is good to absorb those big boss hits, but will get drained fast by lots of smaller hits from many mobs.
---
Adjust as per encounter preference
---
Vitality is easier to get (better stat combinations), toughness may be better to have (in open world).
---
* Vitality gives you a larger heath pool. An extra 1000 vitality gives you 10,000 higher health.
---
* Toughness reduces the amount of direct damage you take. An extra 1000 toughness reduces incoming direct damage (not condition) by about 1/3 assuming medium exotic armor. For ascended armor, it's a few percentage points less.
---
Your healing skill heals you for a specific amount, not a percentage of your total health. If your healing skill has a fairly short recharge, high Toughness may feel better because your healing has a much bigger impact on your health. If your healing skill has a long recharge, you may be stuck with getting a high health from Vitality and just hope you can kill the enemy before it kills you.
---
That being said, Ferocity is also a "defensive stat" because the enemy can't hurt you when they're dead. Almost all open world content can be done with Berserker stats, some dodging, and some kiting.
---
I don't disagree that raids are easy, but then why do I constantly see players complaining about the difficulty? Why is the completion rate so low? Why do I see experienced players failing mechanics? (As you said yourself)
---
For Rabid on the TP, do I just search Rabid or is there a certain name I should look for?
---
I don't have the Skycale yet but I regret not getting the Griffon sooner, I'm absolutely in love with it. The 250 gold is more than worth it. Once you've fully maxed out the masteries you'll be able to gain superspeed and also regain your height. Today I returned to Dragonfall (the map you'll be doing a lot of Skyscale collections on) and having the Griffon makes it a lot faster and easier.
---
In addition to what's been said before, you only need to finish PoF to have everything you need for the griffon, whereas you need to have a good part of every LS4 episode behind you, and 250 of every episode's unique resource, to unlock the skyscale. 
---
So griffon is far easier (and some might say cheaper, depending on your use of map currencies) to get than the skyscale.
---
Plus, griffon is very useful to farm map currencies, especially if you're using Tekkit's TacO farming routes.
---
I think two modes would be nice, regular and a slightly easier version for training.
---
However, what about a sponsored mentor program where community leaders are encouraged (compensated in game?) to lead and train groups. Put this into the rotation of streaming with Anet employees in attendance sometimes. 
---
There are some great and patient raid leaders out there and the only few times I have been lucky enough to finish a raid was through their teaching. If only there was some sort of encouragement for this to happen. Maybe even allow them to exceed the weekly caps for rewards while they host a sponsored event.
---
Without redesigning things, Dhuum would be impossible (10% phase requires at least 7 people to press the buttons), KC as well (need at least 6 ppl for greens).
---
Largos fight would be weird as well .. splitting a 5 man comp into 2 groups .. would be weird. Same for Qadim W7 because of the kiters needed. Xera would be finicky as well, at least the initial phase.
---
Many other fights would become way too annoying, like Deimos for instance. One HK BK and tank, you would have only 2 ppl to go greens.
---
In general, a lot of things would have to change, or else one downstate and is insta wipe. You cant simply lower damage and HP.
---
The LFG is already a shitfest and it always has been tbh. Playing with randoms is essentially always going to be filled with cancerous disappointment, and tbh everyone that wants to fake the kp to begin with already is doing so. I think you might be overestimating my influence here.
---
That's not at all how toughness works. It works as a damage reduction multiplier and the size of the hits doesn't matter as long as it doesn't one shot you. Toughness is much preferred when adequate sustain is present so your ehp is more than it would be with vitality instead.
---
I didn't found my self due to what you are accusing but rather being part of the people in the team when the w2/3 happened. I havent defended myself nor can I do that since you refuse to share about the issue.
---
Anet may have reliable data on this, but Twitch representation would be very hard to measure - it may encourage people to try out the game or build a community that keeps existing players going.
---
Regardless, it's generally accepted that appealing to a wide range of players is beneficial for MMOs - even if only 5% of the community raids, a lot of these are players that simply wouldn't play the game otherwise. A small increase to the amount of devs working on such content would mean a lot to that gamemode but probably wouldn't noticably reduce the quality/quantity of Living World content.
---
WvW duels are pretty common too for a hangout spot.
---
Most MMOs don't allow you to duel ANYWHERE, GW2 is just more restrictive.
---
But if you actually want to duel and aren't lazy as shit, it's a non issue.
---
Oh definitely, I don't feel like ANet has done many if any subpar updates but I suppose it's all dependent on what you're after from them.
---
What would be the equivalent for this if I wanted to gear for a Power Greatsword build? 
---
I looked at where to get Viper, and I have no progress on the HoT story currently(well I'm on chapter 3, but basically no progress).
---
Generally speaking, either you search for the stat combination name to get the (mostly) crafted variant of the stuff, or you directly search by stats (ex: a medium head piece with +60 Condition Damage, +43 Precision, +43 Toughness) to sometimes find cheaper alternatives.
---
This gives me a clear knowledge and on-game application on both stats, thanks for the comment. Really appreciate it.
---
4 tiers is wayy too much, raids dont have many people playing as is.
---
------
---
This is my take on it...
---
Living worlds and raids are now joined together.
---
You can do living story as normal now but you can go back and repeat bosses in "Raid mode" which is 10man with added mechanics. Weekly lockout and at the bare minimum 1 boss per living story.
---
Ontop of that we get CMs for living story boss' which drop tradeable cosmetics and have a daily lockout.
---
This gives hardcore raiders a reason to play daily and be excited for LS patches.
---
This gives amateur raiders a reason to try CMs once their lockout hits.
---
It also gives non-raiders reasons to try raid mode because they are invested into the story and the living story mode can show the very basics.
---
I wonder how many non-raiders would have tried a raid fight against Balthazar? Joko?
---
No green ?! My disapointement is immeasurable and my day is ruined !
---
The celebration hat and the dragon emblem clothing are still wearable, if you have them. You just cannot acquire them right now. The dragon emblem clothing was originally town clothes, IIRC. Now it is an outfit.
---
&gt; These were collectible books that provided you with a skill point and played a cut scene telling you more about the creature when you read them.
---
A cutscene for *every* creature. That would be aweseome, but a  huge amount of work.
---
Toughness vs Vitality at level 80...
---
TL;DR:
---
* every 100 Toughness will reduce direct damage by 4-5% (doesn't effect condition damage)
---
* every 100 Vitality will increase effective HP by 5-9% (depending on class)
---
Info:
---
* direct damage calculation is divided by Armor = (Defense + Toughness)
---
* Armor does not affect damage from conditions
---
* every point of Vitality adds 10 health
---
* base Defense with ascended armor is 967 (Light), 1118 (Medium), or 1271 (Heavy)
---
* base Toughness is 1000
---
Assuming 100% direct damage (no conditions)...
---
Total base health at level 80 ([wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Health)):
---
* Warrior, Necromancer - 19,212
---
* Revenant, Engineer, Ranger, Mesmer - 15,922
---
* Guardian, Thief, Elementalist - 11,645
---
With just base stats, base "Effective HP" is:
---
* Warrior = 19212 * 2271/2000 = 21815
---
* Necromancer = 19212 * 1967/2000 = 18895
---
* Revenant = 15922 * 2271/2000 = 18079
---
* Engineer, Ranger = 15922 * 2118/2000 = 16861
---
* Mesmer = 15922 * 1967/2000 = 15659
---
* Guardian = 11645 * 2271/2000 = 13222
---
* Thief = 11645 * 2118/2000 = 12332
---
* Elementalist = 11645 * 1967/2000 = 11452
---
If you add 500 Toughness (% compared to base):
---
* Warrior = 19212 * 2771/2000 = 26618 (122%)
---
* Necromancer = 19212 * 2467/2000 = 23698 (125%)
---
* Revenant = 15922 * 2771/2000 = 22059 (122%)
---
* Engineer, Ranger = 15922 * 2618/2000 = 20842 (124%)
---
* Mesmer = 15922 * 2618/2000 = 19640 (125%)
---
* Guardian = 11645 * 2771/2000 = 16134 (122%)
---
* Thief = 11645 * 2618/2000 = 15243 (124%)
---
* Elementalist = 11645 * 2467/2000 = 14364 (125%)
---
If you add 500 Vitality (aka + 5000 HP):
---
* Warrior = 24212 * 2271/2000 = 27493 (126%)
---
* Necromancer = 24212 * 1967/2000 = 23813 (126%)
---
* Revenant = 20922 * 2271/2000 = 23757 (131%)
---
* Engineer, Ranger = 20922 * 2118/2000 = 22156 (131%)
---
* Mesmer = 20922 * 1967/2000 = 20577 (131%)
---
* Guardian = 16645 * 2271/2000 = 18900 (143%)
---
* Thief = 16645 * 2118/2000 = 17627 (143%)
---
* Elementalist = 16645 * 1967/2000 = 16370 (143%)
---
Notes:
---
* as a rule of thumb, every 100 toughness will increase effective HP by about 4-5% compared to base
---
* in all cases, the Effective HP is increased more with Vitality than with Toughness
---
* for characters with a higher base HP, Vitality is less useful than for low base HP characters
---
* Toughness also makes static heals more effective - if you heal 2000 HP with more toughness, that 2000 HP will last longer
---
* Vitality makes percentage based more effective - Herald's [Infuse Light](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infuse_Light)
---
* Toughness not effecting condition damage is a big downside depending on what you're fighting
---
* actively avoiding damage with evades/blocks is better than trying to absorb it with stats
---
It's part of the anonymity system that Reddit is based around and to let anyone of the public see who is voting defeats that purpose. 
---
I'll admit when I became a mod I was very upset upon learning that as I had hoped to track down the users that seem to downvote any post here within 1-5 minutes of posting and see if it was a coordinated effort, but my only option was to message the admins who told me that they saw nothing strange and that was that.
---
And to backup what /u/AlasdairDracul said, yeah if mods could see it, it could lead to a ton of abuse and just more problems all over the site so while it can be annoying, overall it is a very good thing.
---
NGL when I played I just afked them for weekly lockouts.
---
Didn't even bother trying to find a raid group, was too much hassle.
---
So Asuras Infinity Ball Personal story?
---
Why does all the cool shit get culled from the game O_O I'd rather have ACTUAL LORE! Than some dumbass meem chairs.....
---
Assuming US servers cant join this unfortunately?
---
yeah, suddenly people use a few assassins pieces or even eagle runes instead of scholar in level 80 solo records...ever wondered why that is?
---
That's because they set skins mostly by rarity and source. 
---
So when you get a masterwork medium armor, it's almost always privateer armor.
---
Just as planned.
---
PRAISE...
---
*ahem*
---
Nothing... nothing...
---
Very interesting! But it there a reason the books have a link to [https://www.blogger.com/null](https://www.blogger.com/null) which gives a 404? :D
---
One can never overhype things in this game because anet never fucking delivers it's so sad.
---
This is the best timeline.
---
Also no dodges would break mirages
---
Its math tho...
---
Can you put Jormag and Primordus in the corners, cause that would make it epic.
---
&gt;That's if you find a guild that does stuff in your game time
---
Like in any other MMORPG that offers raids? Casuals (like myself) aren't entitled to boss kills, just because they own the game. It's an MMORPG after all.
---
Mistlock Sanctuary*
---
Give me a *proof* that you're the artist, not just this comment. Anyone could tell me the same.
---
Raid trainings don't require any kp, just go to one of the many discords in your mega server that does raids for everyone.
---
Can you put Jormag and Primordus in the corners, cause that would make it epic despite the fact that you made it based on weaver :)
---
Yeah but thing is, Balthazar is the antagonist that could be killed, actually supposed to be killed to prevent doom. What I'm saying though is defeating the said antagonist without actually killing him, or even confronting him due to it being the constraint itself. In this case, you are forced to do something or villian gets to bring havoc, bur you can't kill him either, which means you have to find a way to solve the problem the traditional way wouldn't be able to.
---
Its possible though and as long as there has been a couple people working on it in the background for a while its very doable.
---
Balthazar would be my vote.
---
A melee 2handed GS spec that can go burn condi or power would be nice.
---
I Feel like TacO has been over a thick line against the ToS for a while i know that a lot of ppl have been using this addon, but idk if it really should be allowed, seen to help a lot the "TP BARONS" and give an unfair advantage over the ppl that are not using, and thats not only over the trading post features even on raids i think this addon really hurts the game.
---
I strongly disagree with splitting raids like fractals. There's hardly enough people as is playing them. 
---
1.) Getting 50 players into an instance shouldn't be difficult? Maybe I just don't understand the tech that goes behind getting people into the same area. Then reduce it to 24 doesn't have to be 50, but a higher number of participants is what I mean.
---
 
---
2.)I'm playing ff14 and their alliance raids have 24 people with arguably more cluttering of the screen with their shinier effects than gw2, and people see/talk to each other/understand and have more mechanics than gw2 raids. And they are ez faceroll. 
---
3.) Assuming there will be players playing these raids after an update like this to even progress in tiers seems like a gamble. I do hope it works though.
---
&gt; The thing is: when running Open World PvE solo, you must focus first on survivability (Toughness, Vitality and Healing Power) and going for DPS
---
Big nope. In the open world fights are spread out and mobs die pretty fast, dead things deal no dmg. Unless you are trying to solo Champs and legendary mobs investing into Toughness, Vitality and Healing is only going to hurt you. If you take some Vit or SOME toughness or SOME healing sure they can help but can quickly cut down your potential dmg out put. So the less dmg you do the longer you stay in fights and the more you have to dodge/heal/tank w/e.  The best defense is more offense, to help with that stun breaks, condi clease and skills the mess up the mobs help ie blinds, stuns, weakness and things that give boons to you also help, protection, fury, might, etc.
---
&gt; Someone that can sustain 3-5k DPS without dying does way more than someone that can do 15k but dies every 5 seconds and has to go back all the way from a waypoint.
---
3-5kdps is pure support range and if you are going around inthe open world in a build like that I dont know how you do it. It is very possible to play a build that can maintain 8-10k dps under its own power while not dying every 5 seconds in the open world.
---
When it comes to trading post stuff, it gives no more advantage a website on a second screen does.
---
It was just an example. Rev shipped with a lot of bases covered with their legends. Sooner or later they're going to run out of purely unique niches for them to fill. As pointed out earlier, warrior already had two elite specs that mainly just refined existing talents. Thief flat-out had to nerf acrobatics to make daredevil more powerful. Revenant will not remotely be the first to experience this kind of issue.
---
Don't worry over it. People will complain no matter what happens. Let's focus on getting this game to a healthy place before we worry about elite spec predictions being practical or not.
---
This is a good start:
---
- Tier 1:
---
 Regular Damage, no one-shots and no time limit. (they'd be on par with 10-man fractals then)
---
- Tier 2:
---
 Current Raids
---
- Tier 3: CMs for _every_ boss fight &amp; inbetween encounter
---
- Tier 4: only 1 per class allowed encounters. "forced Diversity" (also mandatory 9-man :P)
---
We don't know that it will be free content though.
---
Pretty sure Lindsey said a while back around the layoffs that they wanted to change things up.
---
This one speaks the truth.
---
check the solo videos where they comment on this. if a class like ele with fury and trait already reaches 95% critchance in zerker gear &amp; for example eagle runes there is not a single reason to not pump it up to 100% by switching out maybe 2 pieces.  
---
sure you can go on the golem and grind numbers and grind numbers and at some point you will have higher dps with the 95% because you were lucky with crits. but in reality, if its easy...and on most classes it is, just go for it.  
---
most classes also have at least a tiny bit of might generation...there is nothing more disheartening when you use all your burst skills and you shitluck goes in, not a single crit and the enemys is still alive even tho it should die within the burst.
---
As a casual player, I would love this. I want to experience the raids, but dont want to wipe with a pug for four hours to do it.
---
You wouldn't sound like sjw if it was, lets say, some other, classically feminine kind of character. But somehow it is always this.  Gets old very fast, especially with two in a row. 
---
Kalla wasn't from gw1 (the whole conflict she represents kinda is, it was barely touched in gw2 and is hardly relevant), but Jora surely is. For the majority of gw2 players she is just a forgotten page in gw1 wiki. Why would any *gw2* player take it over more recent and impactful things like balthazar?
---
Posted toilet paper. They liked it, so I stayed ;)
---
More or less.  Delta misunderstands.  Getting newer players into raids  -4 years after their release has less to do with the content difficulty and more to do with them feeling ***socially*** comfortable with people they already have strong, reliable friendships and experiences with.  Most are very, very averse to any form of criticism so asking them to trust strangers isn't a good plan.
---
Did you even try to do map completion to be talking all of this? You literally roam around killing nothing while not-dying for 90% of the time.
---
Occasionally you find a Hero Point which requires you to kill a mob that dies in literally 10 seconds if you can do anything above 5k DPS. Occasionally you find Hearts that require you to kill mobs, which, in this case, having cleave skills is infinitely more effective than building DPS.
---
You admitted yourself that fights are spread out and mobs die fast. So why build to kill stuff fast if it already dies fast and we aren't even killing most of the time?
---
Going the damage route when playing solo is one of the worst advices you can ever give when doing map completion. You will eventually get intercepted by a big group of mobs, you will get in the way of an eventual Champion from a Group Event, so the most time you'll be wasting won't be killing mobs, it will be getting backtracked to a Waypoint because you died. This gets many times worse if you don't have a mount to flee from mobs and to quickly get back to where you were when you die.
---
Source: me facerolling map completion as a Weaver
---
I'd rather have a preview window, letting you zoom, turn and pan the model to look at it carefully.
---
Wow that is absolutely gorgeous!!!
---
&gt; Chicken or the egg kinda thing
---
It's not, no.
---
WoW started with 1 Tier - Standard 40 man. Then it became 2. 10 man/25 man. 3--10 man/25 man with CM.
---
&gt;They're all from GW1
---
I'm not saying that this is something good. Barely any gw2 player knows what most of them are and nobody actually cares about them.  Like, Mallyx is some random demon dude. Ok /shrug.  Svanir is that random manbearpig thing in the spvp map. Ok.  Ventari is  mentioned in sylvari  storylines (but is still kinda bland on its own), thats better.
---
I would like to see something that *both* has long backstory and is represented in the current game, with the second requirement being more important. Glinth was fine, especially after they fleshed her out more. Balthasar is great, especially if they'll bring out some of his old lore.   Don't just parasitize on gw1.
---
Were just doing Guild Missions and bounty trails and other markers stopped rendering after map change and wouldn't load untill full reload of TacO.
---
Thats why i'm suggesting to focus more on getting new players into raids. It's not relevant if raids are too ez for you, me or someone else. As long as we are a minority, it will not help to split us.
---
I like this but I feel like one still wouldn't be able to find a welcoming team...
---
&gt; \+ The LFG will be split into tiers, with casuals and raid beginners/trainings populating Tier 1, regular raiders in Tier 2, CMs in Tier 3 and Tier 4 would be populated by hardcore players 
---
Actually that's either going not be the case, or become a big disadvantage. The raid community is already small, the LFG sometimes takes ages to fill and further splitting it would only make things worse.
---
And before you say....
---
&gt; \+ This system allows for progression, means people can get familiar with the mechanics and then complete the encounters at a higher difficulty 
---
No, this is not how things work. The only reason there' is a progression in FotM is because of the imposed AR requirement. The system *forces* you into one, it's not something happening naturally. Furthermore, FotM is a strong argument why the community won't split - everyone and their mother is under T4, you could almost see tumbleweeds rolling over when you open lower tier LFG. By mistake, obviously.
---
&gt; \+ Both casuals and hardcore players would be pleased imo 
---
Wrong. If casuals can't casual their way to the shinies, they would still be displeased and whine like there's no tomorrow. If they *can,* hardcore players would be rightfully pissed off. Same effect.
---
&gt; \+ Better rewards 
---
This assumes raids need to have better rewards in the first place. They're already a solid source of gold and metric tons of ascended stuff. 
---
&gt; \+ I'd expect this system would lure in new players from the casual scene as you can clearly see how you're progressing and they might enjoy raids 
---
Even more wrong. The whole point of raids is their difficulty. They are enjoyable because they are challenging content which requires decent execution of party-wide team strategy. Rob them of that and they become glorified world bosses. Like Frosty, or whatever that boss in the Wintersday "raid" was called. And the thing is, the players who enjoy this type of content already whack world bosses across Tyria. And they don't become raiders, unless they seek that same challenge I mentioned. It's not about tiered difficulty, it's about mentality. You either have it or not. You might develop it if you don't have it, but the game can't make you have it. It's always your own choice.
---
In the end you're proposing an awful lot of work with a best case scenario outcome "nothing really changes".
---
This ^ really.
---
My suggestion would be deadeye as the "rotation" is rather easily summed up as spam whatever does the most damage.
---
Not going to disagree that the "strong independent woman gunna teach the bois how it's done while the guys look like idiots" meme pushed these days isn't worn out.
---
In this case though in terms of looking for people who were legends, specifically in the context of this thread old legendary Norn, OP suggests Svanir, but the problem there is he wasn't legendary, he's just an angsty loser who succumbed to Dragon, he's edgelord at best and in no way worthy of being a legend, so in the context of this thread I suggest Jora.
---
Yeah there are a bunch of people who'd make awesome legends, Turai or Varesh Ossa (but if we get a Dervish it would need to get a true scythe weapon type not just a staff with a pointy bit, which I realize many people feel scythes are "oooh deathy scythey edgelordy" about, I just love the swirly flow of movement), I'd be down for a pretty wide range of people, but the concept of legends kinda lends itself to people from the past, i.e. GW1 era or before. That said what about Faolain? Or Trahearne? We don't have a Sylvari legend, or an asuran one either for that matter.
---
Mate you can say that about any feature in the game ever
---
Absolutely. I think their social media channels should be teasing the fuck out of things. We should have been teased about legendary runes/sigils. Even if it's just like "Hey, remember that roadmap? Your first stop is right ahead!"
---
Or Asgeir Dragonrender.
---
Totally. Most people learn by doing, not watching videos. I wouldn't have made the jump into t3 fractals successfully without doing tier 1 and 2 first. I'm glad they had those introductory phases
---
Yeah sure i get your point but i think raiding in general would be much more attractive of you could just work your way up like fractals for example
---
Ppl could do low Tiers just for enjoying that extra bit of story without getting frustrated because of multiple wipes during training runs
---
:V
---
Keep in mind that some of your enthusiasm is \*because\* it's not in the game. Like, imagine if we didn't have world bosses in the game and that was teased. OH my god, they planned to put giant monsters in the open world? Why does all the cool shit get culled? Oh wait, it's in the game and they're boring with few exceptions because they don't have any/many interesting mechanics.
---
we would need a bookcase to store it in along with all the other books :)
---
Pretty sure what it's missing is the balance that gw1 had before they butchered it a year and a half before gw2 release. Gw2 simply never had a time in it's long history where something wasn't insanely imbalanced in pvp.
---
First we had thieves, then we had bunker guards, then we had mesmers, then we had overbuffed heal sig warrior,etc etc etc.
---
J just came back to this game and sub. Are Monstrum's deranged scribbles still around?
---
I don't think I really agree that tiers would be a good addition to GW2 raiding.
---
There's no gear grind, and the 'on-ramp' to raiding already exists in Fractals. If you can do T4 Fractals, you can do raids. You don't need an easy-mode raid to learn the mechanics, especially when there are community efforts like training raids which do that.
---
The content's supposed to be evergreen. It *should* actually take you time to chew through in the same way an old arcade game *should* take you time to chew through (though obviously not to the same extent).
---
As far as dressing it up to make it sound like it benefits raiders who want 'more difficult content', this is not an effective solution. They just master the content and then complain that the new content is not hard enough again, and you have to go back and try to fix the problem again. The best thing for the raiding community now would probably just be more raids.
---
I wouldn’t know, I’m still pretty new to this sub, honestly. But I haven’t seen too much art content lately.
---
&gt; We have allegations and very flimsy evidence of vote manipulation
---
And where are those, so we can all see?
---
&gt; the only thing we can do, remind people that it is against the Reddit rules, and message the admins to check into it.
---
That and change the rules to make it so you can delete post that you don't really like or think they don't help the game in general.
---
I'm not completely convinced. S4 seems like a continuation of PoF. More mounts, continuative story, and that's it. Yes, the amount of content is fucking insane ("nO ContenT"), with several large collections, individual high quality mounts with their own mechanics and masteries and modes of transportations, as opposed to WoW-like mount-skins that provide nothing but a speed boost. We got detailed and large maps and honest to God fantastic gizmos like that prototype rewinder that, for whatever reason, doesn't even reach people's mind. I use that damn thing all the time.
---
But.
---
That's just an upgrade vom S4, not expansion-level features. HoT brought gliding, PoF brought mounts, S5 needs to bring something similiar to keep up. Housing, companions, double-classing, whatever. While never ever actually announced, it's safe to assume that we're going to get specializations. It'd be mind-blowing if not.
---
Regarding the season pass, I don't see that fly well with people. It's basically a sub, and I'm convinced suddenly turning a long-standing B2P game into a season pass game will nuke the playerbase from orbit. It's also not necessary: GW2 is doing fine. Finances are good. NCsoft bitchslapped the shit out of them, but somehow the cash shop does indeed carry the game.  
---
What I can imagine is them selling specializations, however. Instead of an entire expansion.
---
Yeah sure but i think raiding in general would be much more attractive of you could just work your way up using lfg and not some external tools 
---
Like fractals for example. You Start your journey at tier1 an most ppl end up in tier4
---
Ppl could enjoy that extra bit of Story without getting frustrated because of multiple wipes during training Runs and continue raiding after that if they enjoyed that „new“ type of content
---
Challenges:
---
1. No downed state
---
2. Dodging doesn't give immunity
---
3. Boss auto-attacks steal a boon (AoE)
---
4. Boss auto-attacks have lifesteal
---
5. Every few second there is a big damage pulse
---
6. All stats are reduced by 20%
---
7. Boons and conditions are halved in duration (by the boss and players alike)
---
8. Defiance Bar gets tripled 
---
9. Healing gets reduced by 50%
---
10. Additional trash enemies get spawned equivalent to DPS
---
11. All power damage gets reduced by 30%
---
12. Permanent crippled
---
13. Get damaged every time you gain a boon
---
14. When the encounter begins, every 10 seconds a random utility skill gets a 30 second cooldown 
---
15. Profession mechanics are disabled
---
I love this thread.
---
She should be used like Captain Marvel because she is equally as OP now. Aurene has a whole planet to explore and take care of, she doesn't have time for one sub-continent that has heros and strong enough diplomatic ties between it's countries to handle major, world ending threats.
---
Not sure if I missed it at first, or if you edited your original post, but if you plan to buy the expansions, keep in mind you get a free level 80 tome with each.
---
both are called Mighty Iron Rifle and Pistol
---
Sorry, but thats not how this works. Thats like me stating that eating icecream makes you more likely to get hit by a car. Proof me otherwise.
---
On the rest: WoW? And wildstar had other - bigger - problems. Like regionlocking on where you buy your copy. Overall, the failing of wildstar can be mostly attributed to bad management decisions. And ofc, there was barely a learning curve - or learning content, that hurt the game a LOT, since hardcore players that didnt need the learning curve where just way too soon in endcontent (without others to play it with) and those that need a longer learning curve hit a brick wall. But sure, wildstar failed because it offered hardcore endcontent. Keep on believing that if you want. Just dont try to argue that point with anyone outside your toxic casual bubble.
---
they took the carpet it was on too
---
Hes on summer break right now, but hes still around.
---
well for me the difference between mmorpg and the corpg is, that gw1 is not massively, you only run instanced content with maximum 12 people and thats the difference to real mmorpgs. I could be wrong, but thats my definition of an mmoXXX
---
Well technically here in my downvoted comment
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ci50po/join_us_for_a_special_live_event_on_august_30/ev42dex
---
Hot picture. I look sexier though just so you know.
---
if you want a braindead rotation, use berserker. The new Berserker rotation just uses 2 axes without weapons swaps.
---
But in the end is the story the prestige or the items you get? The issue with prestige in gw2 raids is there's not much that's exclusive to beating the hardest content. Closest thing we have to that is some titles and qadims chair.
---
Amen.
---
Don't blame the monsters D: the only reason they are shitty is because Anet sucks at balance, and when they actually did make (tequatl)  hard/challenging people started to whine like babies cause they couldn't faceroll it anymore. Adding a bestiary would generate incentive to go back to pretty much everywhere and play the game again, which is exactly what gw2 needs :x
---
I'd think it would be a waste if a Jora legend didnt include references to her becoming the bear
---
But then you have to see all the ugly asura.
---
Counterpoint: video games are a hobby. However, GW2 is only one part of that hobby and not the entirety of it. It's not healthy to be too invested in any one game.
---
I'm also disappointed in ANet, and feel like they've wasted potential. I appreciate when folks make suggestions for improvement. But getting emotional over it just screams of caring too much. 
---
GW2 is a game. No different than Tetris or Frogger, but with a lot more content and other people to interact with. 
---
For my part, if GW2 went on maintenance mode, I'd still play it for a while before I too would get bored and move on. And that's okay.
---
v39 works fine. Problem was with v40 - it activated Screen Edge Herds Icons and when I deactivated it next time we jumped to another map all markers were gone. After reloading v40 markers would appear but after next change of map they would be gone again.
---
Ten trillion hours and we only get 28 mounts
---
They are calling the centaurs 'equine beasts with humanoid torsos'... seems strange with the ratio Centaurs to horses
---
Does anyone learn any lore from merely having access to their skills?
---
There's the answer -- The Mighty Iron Rifle is a two handed weapon, and the Pistol is a one handed weapon. Two handed weapons have more stats on them compared to one handed weapons (as you can wield two one handed weapons at the same time).
---
Assuming the pistol is the level 1 weapon and the rifle is the level 0 weapon, dual wielding two level 1 pistols should give more stats than the level 0 rifle.
---
FYI, should not spend $$$ on that on lower levels, since the lower levels toons level up extremely fast. If you do personal history, game will also reward you some good loots.
---
... of Warcraft!
---
I think it's not considered an MMO because outside of towns and outposts, you're not in the world with other players, only those who are in your party. That's why it's called a co-op rpg, since there's nothing "massive multiplayer" about it.
---
I would LOVE to see a Guild Wars single player game. No MMO elements at all.
---
It gives them a better chance to actually have decent and consistent writing. And it would be fun.
---
My mesmer in exotics just did 27k so git gud
---
nah, i appreciate the thought, but it's the same for them individual, there are lvl 0 and lvl 1 mighty iron rifles, and level 0 and level 1 mighty iron pistols both of which the level 0 ones are better
---
141-166 damage on lvl 0,  5 power
---
134-158 damage on level 1 pistol, 4 power
---
similar for rifle
---
As a casual who would probably like an easy mode, the "everything deals half damage or less" feels like an insult.
---
That is one sexyass globe
---
Because toxic criticism (or negative reinforcement) isn't the same as positive reinforcement.
---
Or start on Cairn, if your whole group is fairly new. VG needs a fair bit of coordination, while Cairn is (mostly) a solo mechanics check - most mistakes screw only you.
---
Oh good. I've heard so much about the exodus from the game and I was afraid he was one of them. I should check the archive of his posts, though, because I've been OotL for a year or so.
---
GW2 would better with no downstate and a slightly easier time staying up. Prove me wrong.
---
Bad players shouldn't play raids. No easy mode, no help for casuals. If someone is willing to learn, they will get into raiding.
---
Hey dude, just respect the artist's wishes. If she doesn't want it on here, then take it off. It's not that hard.
---
Stop acting like the victim as if someone stole your art, I linked your profile, but no. You needed to make a huge drama to get more followers and play the victim. lol
---
This is why no one takes artists seriously anymore.
---
lol
---
i don't always but when it's a new character and i want to try out a bunch of weapons i like having the lowbie blue ones even if they don't last, it isn't too much money but appreciate the tip anyway :)

/r/LakeLaogai/

so it's all a bit weird then lol
---
&gt; couple mins

---
Yeah, he still loves the game :3
---
I like the idea of having tiers. I don't play very much anymore, and definitely never tried a raid for fear of being the sole reason an entire run failed. But there are some really cool settings characters and stories that I've had to rely on Wooden Potatoes to show me. So at least if I join a Tier 1 group, I know that the stakes will be lower, and people's expectations in playing it would not be as high.
---
That seems unlikely with the way people want to consume content now. Spawns would be farmed, people wouldn't want to wait for the collection to complete more naturally and, when done, they'd go back to complaining that there is "no content".
---
storage and electricity (server) will probably be dirty cheap in the future, especially when there is quantum computing
---
Living world has only been the focus on the game for a few years, and it's slowly killing the game. It's not content that draws in new players.
---
What prestige is there in raid encounters designed for 10 that are completed by 3?
---
not ranged though
---
You can make a f2p alt on EU.
---
Another ideas would be having the raid gain modifiers based on the difficulty setting you choose (if you've ever played path of exile, endgame maps roll with 2-6 extra modifiers, randomly, that include loot bonuses to extra difficulty, and each modifier adds % to loot dropped; it's really a great system).  
---
So say tier one would be the base raid, tier 2 would add 1 random mod (mobs are stun immune for example, or double bosses, or players are permanently chilled), tier 2 would add 2 modifiers, 3 for t3 and 4 for tier 4. Each tier up adds more bonuses like rarity/qty of drops.
---
The living story updates aren't incredible lol. The content is generic, the story is painfully bad, and the actual quality of stuff to do is low. It just ends up being more of the same open world content, which is face roll content. Considering it sucks all their resources, it's a terrible invesment. There's good reason I discourage anyone from playing this game.
---
No. The pitch is that elite specs should be side-grades with each other but upgrades over core specs. Any new elite would be a side-grade compared to the two existing ones for the class, but it would still be stronger than the base class.
---
I personally ascribe to the logic I just described because the base classes are honestly relatively uninteresting compared to elites. Why would someone want to use core Guard virtues over DH or FB ones? What exactly is the selling point of Mesmer that makes it more interesting over Chrono or Mirage? Taking fun stuff away from Chrono didn't make core Mesmer more interesting, it just made Chrono less interesting.
---
Going through all the core classes to add mechanics and bring them up to the level of elites would be one thing, but dumbing elites down to the level of core classes is a bad move.
---
I don't feel that way.  
---
I vividly remember wiping on Vale Guardian in the Preview because we tried putting people into the Circles, but apparently only ever 3 or less made it.  
---
At some point we were sure three people were definitely in, and everybody took exactly the same damage as when no-one was in, so we deemed the circles useless for now, and tried to block with Aegis - which kinda worked, but was stupidly harder.
---
I to this day massively dislike that there isn't any kind of mechanic to show that we were on the right path.  
---
Like start with 50k damage when no one is in the circle, 25k with one, 12,5k with 3, 6k with 4, 3k with 5... etc.  
---
We'd have noticed and have had more fun.
---
anyway, I'd love to at least unlock the stupid masteries at some point...
---
&gt;At ArenaNet, if you like this system but don't have any resources to realize, take me as an unpaid intern :\*

take a warrior with 7% crit sigil &amp; eagle runes &amp; both signets (power + prec) as easy example...2856 power, 86% crit, 262%critdamage vs 2565,100% crit, 264% critdamage...standard 2597 armor.

if you go by 100 hits and just use chop as single axt skill (0,6s castime with aftercast, 0,7 coeff, 1000 weapondamage), so easy 1 min chopping. perfect rng, 86% hits are crits...on the other hand 100%.

difference in dps is 28. a mere 28 in favor of the build with more power.  
---
now go into more complex rotations where suddenly some high coefficient skills do not crit and you will see a much broader variance in terms of dps. you won't have that problem with 100% where your skills always crit, you can never fuck up your opener because rng strikes and eviscerate or something like that descided to not crit 2 times.  
---
with a 55% modifier the difference is still only 44 on such a simple rotation.  
---
now just add 10 might to the whole thing and suddenly the 100% crit build is already outshined.
---
No.
---
THIS. This is all my warrior ever needs.
---
I think instead of 4 tiers there just needs to be 3:
---
Tier 1 (story mode): Normal damage. No time limit. Increased time for mechanics (perhaps make the boss attack slower). It might even go as far as describing the mechanics. 
---
Tier 2 (normal mode): Same as the non-CM versions we have now
---
Tier 3 (challenge mode): Same as the current CM versions. 
---
I’m not going to get into what I think the rewards should be as I believe that is something for anet to decide. I do believe that the story mode would need to be lucrative enough for people to do it though or be required before you can open up a normal mode version.

Looks like it's time to update it, thanks u/that_shaman!
---
They might have something like the War Eternal Supply Drop thing, but certainly not a MANDATORY sub fee or season pass in order to play S5.
---
Maybe Sif? She was a leader in eotn.
---
Though I agree people shouldn’t get too hyped, I am. I do everything in pve, all the achievments, the metas, map comp- the casual stuff and I also do t4 daily and try hard there. I also do raids and in autumn plan on finally getting the voice in the void title (don’t have a static so my solution is to pug like I did demons demise- due to work had no time this past year to dedicate many hours daily for wipes and wipes and wipes). So for me anything anet announces is content that I will play and very likely to enjoy. Idc if they don’t mention “more frequent raids”.
---
&gt; Those books dropped randomly from monsters and you had to collect 3 of them to unlock skill point and the whole text.
---
I don't recall this, but I do recall how at one point they were given by NPCs, similar to hero challenges now. They even rewarded a skill point (pre-Hero Points) and counted to map completion, which was a big part of why they got scrapped from what I recall.
---
1 2 1 2 3 1 
---
Is that the secret chord mentioned in the song Hallelujah?
---
It's a petty they didn't give rev an old Nightfall hero as legend for PoF. I can see a legendary paragon (Morgahn) or legendary dervish (Melonni) with appropriate builds work. Who knows, maybe in the future.
---
It was cinematic form in a coding sense, but it was ultimately just pulling up a model with an artistic background to it as text scrolled by. More similar to the character select, really.
---
If elites are not better, if trade-off is "your rotation is crap, your utility is crap, your risk goes up 200%" to "your DPS is tiny bit better" then screw this. Elite specs should be significantly better otherwise people wouldn't buy the expansion. And they'd be right. 
---
I also presume next elite specs might negate trade-off of current ones (in other words sudden burning desire to screw current builds is simply an attempt to prepare for next round of specs)
---
The Spanish translation of Firebrand is derived from "abrasar" - "burn" or "scorch"
---
"Hug" or related words would have Z in it
---
I spent ENTIRE Faolain fight at the end of HoT while downed on my Rev. Every time I was almost restored from bandaging she jumped me and jumped away to fight NPCs. So if she was close enough I spammed downed 1, if away bandage. It was glorious, yet utterly ridiculous.
---
there is no way, he have to deinstall it to get his game running.
---
Same with the Sons of Svanir, really.
---
I'm going in with no expectations. That way, if there's nothing of value, I'm not really disappointed.
---
And if there *is*, I'll be pleasantly surprised. Seems like a win-win to me.
---
Agreed. My thoughts was to just redo how the challenges work and make it feel more like guild wars rather than bog standard mmo raids.
---
As it stands, theres a huge emphasis on needing healers a tank and dps. Which is what they tried to get away from. It would jave been better to introduce mechanics that forces players to use features unique to their class to protect others like guardian and warriors shields. Mobility like the mesmer or thief teleports. Range like ranger. And so on.
---
Use of combi fields would be nice too
---
Sorry, I disagree.
---
Originally, the elite specs were supposed to NOT be stronger than core specs, but "only" change the way a class was played (the "elite" in elite specs was referring to the fact that you can only have 1 elite dpec equipped, just like you can only have 1 elite skill - not to the faxt that they are stronger). As we know, this has not been the case until recently; nonetheless, I still think that it's better late than never (although it really should have been sooner - I have been having quite a few difficulties to adapt to a few of the recent changes myself).
---
Having elite specs that are not stronger than core specs means, to me, upholding that promise anet made a few years ago: not making core specs "obsolete", and as such allowing for an higher number of viable builds and thus styles of gaming. And having more options is something I always rate highly.
---
Could be interesting if they made a creature-codes collection.
---
Exactly.
---
This happens with any game over time though and people don't want to accept that it happens to be that time for GW2. I remember the Blizzard forums were like this during the Mists of Pandaria era when the player base was like 'wait a minute'.
---
During the Festival of the 4 Winds event I'm sure this backlash will die down a bit and in late August when they show off LWS5 it will be pleasant again because we'll actually have something to look forward to.
---
while i agree that trade-offs should've been introduced with the especs rather then added now  but leaving them as is would just be stupid and no, it wouldn't be "much easier to handle from a gameplay balance perspective."in the long term (as compared to the short term issues we're seeing now)
---
At this point Arenanet could sneeze and people would get hyped over it.
---
this is a nice idea but i dont think it would work with gw2 population
---
not much we can do about it so long as hype culture stays a thing
---
I don't think I need to talk to you tho.
---
It isn't about the gender per se, but about the same stereotype that incudes that gender. Don't pretend that you don't understand it, this isn't tumbler yet.
---
Yea the combat is fine, i agree
---
What do you want then?
---
I see what you did there... That's cool :wink:
---
Holy shit a good post
---
Great idea
---
Now to have ANet do it.. maybe 2022
---
LFR isn't even close to raiding though.
---
Indeed.
---
At most they may try more "[Supply Drop Requisition](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/War_Eternal_Supply_Drop_Requisition)" kind of things. But always optional.
---
And I, as another such casual, would prefer it anyway.
---
No that is why base specs are constantly overlooked. 
---
We should stop calling them elite specs and they need to be at the power level of the base specs.
---
That would promote build variety and ultimately that will keep the game less stagnant than it currently is. It would be very cool to have builds in higher level of play that are all but extinct now make a comeback and stay relevant.
---
Well, maybe then a-net should add some? Unique flashy mount skins (or even something mechanically different) that are unlocked by doing cm achievemement and are bought with a sizeable amount of raid currency (to ensure that whoever gets them is a seasoned raider and not just one time buyer).
---
That would be the start and might provide players with incentive to actually start raiding and talke somehwhat difficult content. 
---
Legendary armor sort of worked, but it was years agon and then they added pvp/wvw armors that are achievable with zero skill requirements.
---
I'd hate to ever go back to core profession gameplay ever again tbh. Elite Specs are just so much more fun and more engaging to play than the borefest that is core.
---
But again, what's the virtue in having them be sidegrades with core spec? They introduce new mechanics, me skills, and a new weapon; I'm not sure it's really even possible for such a comprehensive extension of the base profession merely be an alternative.
---
Take scrapper, as an example. The hammer offers great utility but poor overall damage, and the gyros are very much geared towards support. As a consequence, it was always a very niche spec, only really seeing use in PvP for 'bunker' style builds. If you wanted to actually cause damage, scrapper offered no advantages and even put you at a disadvantage over core because you lost a traitline that otherwise could be more geared towards playing a useful role. As a result, the spec was basically not adopted by almost anyone. The 'diversity' it added was in the form of excessively niche, gimmicky builds in a single game mode.
---
Recent changes have made scrapper much more useful, even to the point where it can be useful in PvE in some situations, but as a result there's no longer really any place for core engi once again. The "tradeoff" introduced in the last patch didn't change that; it just made scrapper less rewarding to play, it didn't in any way make ordinary engineer more viable, because core engineer is missing the added mechanics that make scrapper a desirable choice. The only way to change that again would be to increase the magnitude of the detriment to the point where it makes scrapper unplayable. Core engi still won't be any better; it's just that the alternative is even worse. There's still no actual diversity.
---
&gt; "if you dont like it, go play something else"?
---
Yes, that's *very* toxic, and not what everyone who gets tired of playing something does. ^^^/s
---
&gt; While I agree with the concept you are basically saying someone can't voice his frustration and in that case should you also remove posts that, for example, would read like "This is the best community here's a 3 line story about how someone gave me an item when I started the game" or "Best game ever". Then again I'm not against one post or the other I'm just saying that if you want to remove one side of the posts you also need to remove the other side
---
It's a fine line to be sure but I feel that we are generally very open when it comes to voicing frustration posts and very rarely remove them but at the same time the events of the last week had some posts that were not voicing frustration but just trying to stir up drama and caused many fights and many users on both sides borderline breaking rules. We hope that that won't happen again but if we do we need the ability to police it. As far as those types of posts go, a lot of them could be removed under the low effort rule and sometimes we do but a lot of the time we won't do it if it's upvoted, plus with so much negativity it's nice to be reminded of the good sometimes.
---
&gt; This is something that your only proof is your word, and you can't really ban people because you think someone is this kind of person (unless of course, you found an account that clearly looks like that - normally negative karma, gw2 sub only user and only shitty comments without any constructive point to it)
---
If we ban someone for being a trolling account the proof is in their post/comment history. For example the last one we banned was only 1 hour old and had 5 posts saying nothing but game sucks and you should quit. That's a troll and does not deserve to be here. If a users entire post history on this sub is leaving trolling comments on every post then we may take action against that user. It might not be a permanent ban either it might just be a temp one and them told to quit the trolling but we would never do it without an extensive look at their post/comment history. 
---
&gt; So were you allowing trolling before? What do you define as trolling and hating? Where do you draw a line between heating and citicism?
---
We weren't really allowing trolling before but we didn't have a specific rule against it. Most trolls before got banned for using hate speech or attacking another user, but some did very good jobs to not break any rules other than just constantly badmouth the game and nothing else, This new rule allows us to remove those people who are being nice, but are still being useless trolls. It's hard to give a clear explanation because context matters a lot here. If ANet does something that really pisses off everyone, like say starts a pay to win mechanic, people are going to be insanely angry and there won't be much criticism, it'll all be hate. But we won't be removing things like that, we will however make it clear to everyone that any form of hate speech or threatening the devs will get you a ban as there are ways to voice anger in better ways. So yeah context matters a lot and criticism where it's a professional post and not just fuck you anet will generally always be allowed.
---
&gt; This is something that depends on the situation (the first line), while I 100% agree that threats are unforgivable I disagree that we are not allowed to call for the firing of a developer should the situation arise.
---
With regards to calling for a dev to be fired, that rule was already in place before the update and mostly is just because it can lead to threats and so on. If a developer does something incredibly wrong like the JP situation, then it is unlikely we would remove discussion about it, but if a class gets a nerf and someone starts posting 'x developer sucks and needs to be fired!' that we would probably remove and tell the user not to post things like that. So basically we would allow it but only in an extreme and necessary situation which hopefully will never happen again.
---
This is the only mmo I've played that has restrictions on dueling and I've played quite a few, call me lazy as shit if you feel like but gw2 doesn't have that spontaneous "hey dude fight me" that the other MMOs I've played have.
---
I mean, I get why we might expect the spec to be inspired by the region - and most PoF specs were - but I guess they can also just give us something that matches the broader context of what's happening. Elona suffered under Joko's tyranny, so renegades were appropriate, despite it being a Charr legend.
---
I don't care much about the lore of a rev spec matching the area, as long as a) it's a decent spec and b) it has decent lore. I was perfectly happy with the wandering renegade in Elon Riverlands explaining to me who and what she is. People level their specs all over every expansion area anyway.
---
Lol you got me.  I’ll grab some pie
---
Some items have non-standard stats.
---
So for you all the expansions offer are the new specs. 
---
That's very a dangerous thing to be heard by Anet. They will end up selling us new specs one by one and calling them expansions.
---
Have fun playing the exact same content with a few new extra skills to press.
---
&gt; but leaving them as is would just be stupid
---
no, it'd be smart.
---
you are imaging a world with infinite resources and infinite manpower to tweak these new changes to old elite specs.
---
anet, and the rest of us, live in a world of limited resources and very little manpower to spare. they've devoted next to no resources to retool the old elite specs, and it showed. the results are understandably bad, and it'll likely stay bad, because it's not worth their time and money to make them good.
---
throwing away thousands of man-hours spent on balancing the old elite specs, to radically change them now, is bad business. i do not know why anet decided to do what they did, but it was bone-headed and stupid, and we now have the live with the fallout.
---
if anet is serious about retooling the old elite specs to have clearly defined trade-offs, they'd have to devote significantly more resources than they have into this task.
---
alternatively, they could simply leave the old elite specs alone, and focus on the future. this is the smarter choice when you don't have a ton of resources to spend.
---
You complain raids are too easy, but too easy for who? Too easy for the people that have the most optimized gear and builds in the game? Too easy for the people that practice their dps rotations to reach 90% of the SnowCrows benchmark? Too easy for the people that play the most optimal squad composition to maximize damage, utility and support? Too easy for the people that try to cheese their way through encounters by doing so much dps you can skip mechanics, and the other mechanics you outheal or block? Too easy for the people that read guides and only stick to the community’s meta standards? Too easy for the people that watch guides on YouTube instead of figuring things out on their own? Too easy for the people that have cleared these wings almost every week since they came out? 
---
It’s cliché to say, but difficulty will always be subjective. It’s not difficult for Usain Bolt to sprint 100m in 10 seconds, while I’m sure you and me both would find it extremely difficult and near impossible. There a lot of “bad” players in GW2 that find raids very difficult. The gap between pressing 1 on a world boss, and say Deimos, is huuuge. Where will these players find a middle ground that will prepare them for raid content and everything that is required of a player to clear raids? Sure you might say “git gud” or “read some guides smh”, but is that good game design from a developers point of view? Is that engaging gameplay? 
---
At this point in GW2, what’s the point in developing content that is never played? Why wouldn’t the developers want the players to play their game, and find ways to engage their community with the content in the game? If having an easy mode for raids allows for this, I don’t see any problem with this? All I see is entitlement from players that don’t want other players to experience the fun and beauty of raid encounters, be it easy mode, normal mode or cm.
---
That forest is just so epuc to fly through on a griffon. Imagine tgat size of queensdale.
---
Considering that Anet has been underhyping their game since HoT, I'm somewhat comfortable to believe that they got big shit in the ready.
---
&gt; So what can be announced on August 30 that **no one** will like:
---
pls stop trying to speak for the whole community.
---
I did that, it's a Mesmer, and I play it as a power Mirage. There is next to nothing I can handle. I got all the utility and all the mobility.
---
But the real king of steamrolling open world is the Minionmancer.
---
&gt;I also presume next elite specs might negate trade-off of current ones (in other words sudden burning desire to screw current builds is simply an attempt to prepare for next round of specs)
---
That could also be the case, and if so i guess it's one way to combat power creep. In all likelihood, though, whatever the new specs are, they're going to start it being either too strong or too weak and will require adjustment anyway. Kicking players in the teeth ahead of time isn't likely to make the new specs easier to balance.
---
We have 3 specialization slots.
---
When you put an elite specialization in the 3rd slot, what you should change is what the profession can do and how they do it. It should not give them extra power that makes it completely better in all rewards than putting a core specialization there. 
---
It should not be like comparing a bicycle and a motorbike, it should be like comparing a car and a motorbike. You can do wheelies with the motorbike, but the car is more stable, yet the different in horsepower isn't as big as between a bike and a motor vehicle.
---
Whichever one you have the most fun with? No fractals, no raids, no spvp, and no wvw means that you're not doing any competitive content, doesn't matter how 'good' your build/class is.
---
I'd pick whatever you find most fun. Don't restrict yourself to a single elite and you can make your profession work at a viable (although not necessarily optimal) level in any gamemode.
---
Guardian. It's probably in the best spot it's ever been. You can be power dps, condi dps, condi support, power support, tank, or healer. It can solo every story with ease and has great aesthetics.
---
Close and stacked game. That was actually fun pog
---
I'm just interested in new stat-versions. Either there are 3-4 random stats put into something. However, we don't see 1-2 stats in one piece, for maximum potential at level 80.
---
&gt; But again, what's the virtue in having them be sidegrades with core spec?
---
the value of having elite specs be sidegrades are-two fold:
---
* don't lose the viability of the core specs, and all of their gameplay choices that they provide.
---
* you can now create elite specs that are more UNIQUELY powerful compared to the core spec, without accidently creating overpowered combinations.
---
before this goes any further, i'd like to briefly clarify how i would handle elite spec trade-offs: gain something, lose something.
---
* gain a new traitline? lose a traitline
---
* gain a new class mechanic? lose a class mechanic
---
* gain a new skill type? lose a skill type
---
remember when thief acrobatics line was nerfed into the ground prior to daredevil being introduced? imagine if daredevil simply lost the ability to choice acrobatics. then both trait lines can coexist, without having one or both be nerfed to compensate.
---
obviously this'll require some careful tweaking, as well as considerations on exactly how to implement this (for example, what to do about elementalist attunements?), but this should work as a general guideline.
---
How do you make a comprehensive addition to the class not an improvement over the core? What's the point of photon forge of it doesn't give you advantages that you'd lack as a base engineer? How do you make it so that a core engi with only ordinary kits is on par with a holosmith, without making it so that holo is simply a more complicated way of doing the same thing?
---
Well, gw2 kinda was... Launch gw2 was a complete pointless snorefest.
---
At this point we can say that HoT was a fluke, someone in the management (Colin? Who knows) wanted to bring the game on a serious mmorpg level with actual endgame content, but then company backed down and ended up here, in our current situation.
---
You honestly think that's the same thing? Pick up your favorite sport, if somewhere were to go up to a group of supporters of a specific team in said sport and go your team is just bad, everyone is moving to other better teams what are you all still here? (clearly an intentional inflammatory statement) and a group of said supporters say they love their team and find them to be great with hardly any faults, do you really see them as the same action ? because its totally not... The original statement is clearly meant to instill a reaction and to hurt people. The response reaction is a genuine, honest view. 
---
It shouldnt be a surprise  that a good amount of supporters of a team feel their team is geat!
---
like wise with a game and its social media there will be players who actually love the game, is it surprising they feel everything is great with the game they love? And dont get me wrong I am not saying this is a case of love is blind its more a case of different people love different things. For example person A might say hey a game with no strict holy trinity is bad, players who love the game likely love the game because they like the fact their classes arent restricted to trinity roles. If they say that a game with no holy trinity is actually a great game, or even is a better game... are they being white knights are they ignoring the issues? no there is no issues for them in the first place and they're expressing that. 
---
At the end of the day, expressing your opinion as long as its not done in a malicious way is not against any rules and thats  regardless if your opinion is positive or negative. and just to be doubly clear here, positive opinions can be against the rules as well if expressed wrongly .For example replying to some complaining the game is too hard and some replies with something like "the difficulty is fine you're just bad yourself"  that just isnt acceptable either.
---
For a moment that sounded like so far away.. but it's next week. Anywho, I'll definitely try to be there and hope my little computer doesn't explode. :oP
---
Too easy for who ever can bother to post on lfg "lf condi scourges", stack 7 or 8 of those with a healer on top and kill pretty much any boss without moving.
---
I always wanted a dual torch thief Juggler specialization that focuses more on the 'street rat' and 'trickster' side of the thief lore, that juggles everything. Even boons and conditions between enemies and allies, and even enemies and allies themselves:
---
&gt; Thieves could use some condition focus. That would means torches.
---
&gt; But plain old boring offhand torch would not do. Only 3 skills + dual wields. This needs more pizzazz. It would have to be DUAL WIELD torches. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Once you get two torches, the one thing one has to do with them is of course juggling them. 
---
&gt; So the specialization must be called "Juggler", and it should be all about juggling, performing seemingly impossible juggling tricks done with Manipulation skills. 
---
&gt; The utility skills would allow Juggling all sorts of things. Boons and conditions, projectiles, themselves when disabled, their own health and enemy health with the healing skill.. And even juggle enemies and allies in the air with the elite Manipulation, that would last 5 seconds, and during that time, as long as they are not interrupted, the thief would be able to flinging allies and enemies within the area around one at a time, allowing the juggle to grab an ally from the grasp of enemy or catch an enemy from between enemy lines back to trouble between your allies.
---
&gt; The torches will of course be medium-long range (900-600 units), and be all about juggling and burning:
---
&gt; * Autoattack would be a bouncing projectile with a high arc that deals a short burning to enemies and might to allies as it bounces between them.
---
&gt; * Skill 3 would be of course Fire eating. The thief 'eats' the flame of a torch, gaining might and losing a condition. The skill then flips over to "Fire Breathing", using the second skill breathes a cone of flames.
---
&gt; * Skill 4 would be a line of coals called Firewalking, that deals extra burning and crippled to anyone walking over it with a speed boost. 
---
&gt; * Skill 5 would be Fire Ring, not to be confused with Ring of Fire, the thief jumps backwards, evading and leaving behind an area that can be entered and left safely if one jumps over the fire, but will burn heavily those who walk over the line, and even more those who stay in the circle after 3 seconds.
---
&gt; One of the Grandmaster traits could be for the Torch, and it would make that last torch thrown bounce indefinitely between enemies and allies for as long as they stay within 180 units from each other.
---
&gt; Their steal skill would be changed to "Get Prop", and F2 would be changed to "Use Prop". Props would be juggling versions of stolen skills, used with slightly different effects. For example, juggling ectoplasm would give boons to allies and conditions to enemies as the glob bounces randomly between them, while juggling an axe obtained from a warrior would create a large swirling arc of several axes that bounce between the juggler and the enemy, causing damage, bleeding and crippled to all enemies hit in their path.
---
&gt; All dual wield skills with the torch in either hand would juggle the weapons in different ways.
---
&gt; * Dagger : Torch - The thief quickly spins around 6 times for 3 seconds while juggling a dagger and a torch over their head. Each spin has 0.25s of evade and hits with the dagger or torch alternatively, dealing bleeding or burning depending on what hits.   
---
&gt; * Sword  : Torch  - Throws the torch in the air, the dashes forward as the torch goes down, hitting the torch as it falls in the middle of the dash trajectory and juggling it during the rest of the dash, dealing torment to all enemies hit by the dash before the torch, and burning to enemies hit after the torch. The dash lasts 1s, and it evades for 0.75s, 0.25s after it starts.  
---
&gt; * Pistol : Torch - Throws the torch in the air, raises the gun and fires repeatedly at it, juggling it in the air. Embers fall from the torch in a line in front of the thief as it juggles, dealing burning to enemies below it.  
---
&gt; * Torch : Torch - Throws torches repeatedly at one enemy, setting them and their surrounding area  on fire. The more torches hit the enemy, the more pulses the area lasts, and the larger it becomes.   
---
&gt; * Torch : Dagger  - Juggles the torch and the dagger by throwing them between several enemies, dealing bleeding and burning alternatively as they are hit.   
---
&gt; * Torch : Pistol  - Throws the torch ahead and shots at it, making it explode and dealing burning and blindness in an area.   
---
&gt; * Torch : Sword - There's no torch offhand for core thief. There should be, but there isn't. If there was, the thief would throw the sword at an enemy, immobilizing them, then cartwheel or repeatedly summersault to the sword to grab it while holding torches with both hands, dealing burning in their path.  
---
&gt; That'll do it.
---
Timberline Falls
---
and just leaving them would eithe cause them to be useless because they're outdatedd or brutally overpowered because the new especs have trade-offs while the old ones don't.
---
secondly this redesigns also adress the massive issue of powercreep that has been introduced with especs which has among other things caused massive balancing issues in pvp and wvw and trivialized older pve content.
---
also how is  fixing old issues not looking toward the future because fixing the issues of the past makes for a better future rather then just mindlessly pushing out content till the game collapse under it's own weight because of longstanding issue.
---
I absolutely love Mount Maelstrom, from the beginning I was just blown away when I got to the volcano part, I think its so natural and beautifully pieced together.
---
What makes you think that all people who leave or everyone who criticise the game are the ones who don't like it?
---
generally speaking, core maps arent that hard at all, i would recommend full berserker with scholar/eagle runes, forget vit/toughness in core. kill them before they can kill you.
---
as for HoT/PoF maps. they get a little more tricky. some mobs will swarm you, toss you around like a teddy bear and condition you dead. toughness is useless against conditions, so maybe get some power/vit trinkets and spec your build with survivability and mitigation, but still wear berserker armour with scholar/eagle runes. use a lot of dodging and positioning. dont just storm in a full group and take them all on, stand back and agro targets one at a time, pull mobs towards you one at a time or force them to run at you in a line by running backwards and lead them, and if surrounded, use all your aoe's at once and dodge back.
---
yea thats why i made it hidden but it seems you got here really fast
---
&gt; mobs would run in terror from the Commander
---
They will run, but from Aurene instead.
---
Oh. It seems I'm missing an email!!
---
Been ages since I haven't used Mistlock as a hub, but iirc Ebonhawke was pretty good.
---
A non-useless espec please :(
---
edit: not named herald
---
&gt; what you're suggesting doesn't work, never has in any game and never will.
---
bold words, but untrue.
---
you can find proof right in GW2, in fact.
---
daredevil prior to the rework wasn't overpowered compared to base thief. both had viable builds in multiple gamemodes (WvW and sPvP at least. i don't care about PvE comment about it).
---
with the rework, daredevil is decidedly weaker than core thief in sPvP and WvW.
---
in this instance, it'd be cheaper and better to have simply left daredevil alone.
---
while obviously powercreeped into the stratosphere years ago, after years of balancing, daredevil was reasonably balanced against core thief, as well as deadeye. it didn't take a drastic redesign to get there, just time and incremental changes.
---
could the reworked daredevil eventually be made to be worthwhile? probably. maybe. but that'll require additional resources, resources that anet may or may not have.
---
for a redesign to have the intended effect, anet will have to pour a lot more resources and time into designing them. so far, i've seen little indication that they're willing to do so. hence my recommendation.
---
the fastest comment in the west
---
That and the Desert highlands map are my favorites (especially dwarven area)
---
Love the variety in locations they have along with different map levels.
---
Not current cm’s. The only one that’s at the level CM’s should be at is Dhuum. 
---
Bosses need reworking at the same time as implementing this. Nothing major for normal bosses. Just number tweak for current power creep. But the CM’s need to be Challenging Modes and repeatable
---
Lol, bro, I think you have some problems if you complain about a game you don't even play.
---
I thought the existing mode _was_ the easy mode.
---
I'd just be happy with them bringing the old multi piece outfit from the original back.
---
They did last year but as a single costume which kind of sucked.
---

---
That's not what you were arguing before, but I'll bite.
---
What constitutes a valid way to criticize in this new example? Just because you don't like half of the game doesn't mean you can do anything at your disposition to criticize it, including being toxic.
---
You stated *"delete gw2, it's dead game"*. Is this what you would consider a valid way of criticizing Guild Wars 2 is?
---
No do...oh god please no.
---
that ship sailed in the alpha. devs literally said esports and pvp were not and would not be a focus for this game.
---
I don't understand. What's wrong with the current system?
---
None. If there was only farming and story I would quit the game
---
Lol naw.
---
daredevil was bad because the upside it provided (aka the additional dodge) is so weak which left DD in a bad spot, even prior to the nerf (or in other words: the change to DD didn't ruin the espec, it made a bad espec worse).
---
also what you're calling evidence that anet lacks the resources to properly pull this off seems to me more like they don't want  to introduce to much change at ones.
---
* Queensdale. It's like a redux of pre-Searing Ascalon. Many of the events are even similar to quests in pre-Searing.
---
For non-core: 
---
* Draconis Mons. Verticality finally done right.
---
* Desert Highlands. Has the best mini-dungeon.
---
They don't have to go to such lengths at all. Just update the LFG tool to be on par with literally any MMO/ multiplayer game out there, that's all they have to do. Make it automatic and so that you can queue up with other people based on skill level which you can choose: beginner, adept, expert.
---
Raid difficulty doesn't really need to change nor does the loot, just let people of similar skill group up and try hard and fail until they get it right, that's practice and how you get better at things. Contrary to popular belief, theorycrafting, snowcrows, wiki and YouTube won't make you better at raids, practice will.
---
Well, if &gt;no fractals raids, then it is basically solo/openworld stuff left and necro is currently by far the best non-record solo class. Mostly power reaper (just don't take defensive stuff, DM, minons, it is a mistake), but condi scouge is nice to have too in more dangerous situations. 
---
If you include raids and fractals, because why not, then guardian. it can cover a *very* wide variety of roles in the group content  decently and still works fine solo.
---
Healing skill: "Bear with it" - tries to heal but can't because you're only a bear.
---
&gt; also what you're calling evidence that anet lacks the resources to properly pull this off seems to me more like they don't want to introduce to much change at ones.
---
that's.... literally the evidence that they lack resources? they didn't want to introduce too many changes at once, because they lacked the resources to properly design-implement-test those changes.
---
doing things half-arsed is worse than doing nothing at all.
---
&gt; daredevil was bad because the upside it provided (aka the additional dodge) is so weak which left DD in a bad spot, even prior to the nerf (or in other words: the change to DD didn't ruin the espec, it made a bad espec worse).
---
this is inaccurate. prior to the rework, there were legitimate  uses for daredevil in certain team compositions. now there are none.
---
either way, this proves that your assertion was incorrect. after all, there you had an elite spec that was a direct upgrade over core with no tradeoffs that was just as powerful as a core spec. it's as if 5+ years of incremental changes could fix balance problems without resorting to big redesigns.
---
Do the aether JP, it's pretty challenging.
---
Too hard for beginners, too easy for seasoned players. No extra loot if you repeat challenge motes.
---
Just putting it out there, why does the legend have to be relevant to the storyline necessarily?
---
4 levels of difficulty, so it's like fractals but for raids. How do we call that, rectals?
---
So now that a few have offered their perspective, I will say that so far, Minion Master is king for me. I've got a Mirage Mesmer and a Power Guardian I play a fair amount, but the necro seems to get through stuff with much less stress. All are just in Exotics, though the Guardian has a couple ascended trinkets.
---
What stereotype? What are you even talking about? You've brought up the gender shtick literally out of nowhere. It was unwarranted and unnecessary. At least give rational, logical reasonings for why you think a "female" legend would be detrimental to the game. You're just blathering about random, unrelated gender issues here. I tried to find an argument to discuss on, but there just isn't ANYTHING there.
---
Look at it a different way. Why do you *want* to play a base class? Is there something fun and interesting that you can do with a base class that makes it exciting? Do you look at core Guard virtues and think, "Yes, what brilliant examples of game design! I love using these fun and interesting skills!"
---
No, of course not. If someone does find a use for a core class these days it's just a numbers game, not an actual issue of interesting gameplay. Core Thief is played for Detonate Plasma builds not because it's an interesting unique mechanic that Daredevil doesn't have but rather because Critical Strikes numerically adds more dps. The same can be said for condi Engineer and the old Unscathed Contender core Guard build - a core trait line is just outperforming the elite trait line in a pure dps numbers game.
---
The *one* exception to this is core Rev because they actually added gameplay to the core spec instead of removing gameplay from the elites. The new Rev F2 is a decent skill that changes how you can manage your energy on a class (the only way to regain energy without swapping legends or waiting), which gives core Rev a unique form of gameplay. This also combines with the fact that Rev has some really impactful core trait lines. Charged Mists in Invocation fundamentally changes how you play the class, and Salvation pretty much single-handedly enables healing builds. Mind you that core Rev isn't necessarily meta anywhere as far as I know, but it's the only core class that I *want* to play - a key element that every other core class is lacking.
---
Base specs are overlooked because they're boring. Yes, elites are more fun. We shouldn't make elites *less* fun so a bunch of outdated 7 year old classes can rear their aging heads and drag down the overall interest level of the game. If you want core classes to be good, make them better. Don't nerf elites.
---
Personal experience: Power Reaper, Blood Magic variant.
---
I did not do any Story content with mine, but I'm a little leery of putting him into the fight against Mordremoth. Or the damn Herald, for that matter, lol.
---
4 tiers is too many, 3 would be good.
---
For the easy mode, I would not nerf damage at all (because it will teach people they don't need to avoid them), but I would reduce the frequency of mechanics by like 50% by doubling the cooldown timers and things like that.  For example:  Desmina's walls still insta-kill but they come 50% less often.  Samarog grabs someone every 20% instead of every 10%.  etc.
---
I agree, Dhuum CM is the only real CM. And the idea of repeatable rewards for the t3 would actually make it easier for some people to get these CM's because more people will be doing them weekly. As it is now it's really hard to find groups for some of the older CM's because a majority of people have them and there is no reason to do them again. If you don't get them during the initial release of a new wing you are kind of screwed.
---
&gt; If people didn't like the game they certainly wouldn't bother wasting time on this sub.
---
Not necessarily true, as some people admit they have quit Guild Wars 2 because they don't like it anymore but still are interested in the news. But I think most people realize that the majority of players are here because they are active in Guild Wars 2.
---
But what you seem to claim doesn't seem like norm. I can certainly see someone posting the criticism on its own, as a counter refer to the people who simply don't like the game yet reply to it, or to the people who've simply reached a point where one would consider them to have grown tired and exhausted of the game, but then it wouldn't really apply to your premise, would it?
---
If there are people deliberately going out to your comments and doing this systematically, I'd think it be a no-brainer that the moderators would take action regarding this, so it also doesn't really explain how it's relevant to their announcement.
---
&gt; Module: nvwgf2umx.dll
---
That looks like the problem occurred in an nvidia driver.
---
Think 3 tiers is enough. Maybe adding cms to. Raids that don't have them would be cool. Reworking the easy ones. (mo cm should be the normal more)
---
Im upvoting mostly because you didnt put “Gets the usual loot” in Tier 1. 
---
Great stuff overall
---
The point is different ways to play a prof. One spec could be melee range control/DPS, another a ranged pure DPS and another a boon/heal provider (these of course are generic examples just to explain the idea).
---
New specs should give us the ability to choose between meaningful specs, not force us to pick them exclusively over older ones because they make those older ones obsolete garbage.
---
How they are properly balanced is Anet's problem. That is why the get paid by us.
---
“Majority of people” you mean the few people from your discord or friendlist?
---
And so many jumping puzzles and minidungeons! My first zone in Guild Wars. I still start Tyria exploration here on new characters.
---
Guild Wars 2 regularly has lower viewer counts than old Nintendo games, like Ocarina Of Time and Super Mario 64.
---
No matter how talented the devs are, if the suits at the top say that x will make them more money then y and z go in the bin and x get milked dry, thats just how it goes.
---
I don't it fits Guild Wars. This game is not that fast paced combat wise, for aerial combat to happen.
---
it sure fucking is about gender, and you clearly have major issues about it.  
---
Tumblr was a place where people self-interrogated their thoughts on such issues and learned and grew, this is a place where people pretend their thoughts are objective and unquestionable.  damn straight reddit will never be as cool as Tumblr was.
---
A well-played power chronomancer is currently by far the most effective open world/story build. It's not even that hard to play it effectively, it just isn't faceroll obvious.
---
Slower but more faceroll options for most content would include necromancer and warrior, any power build variant. However, they will inevitably take *more* mastery to clear the hardest story fights and open world sections than a power chronomancer, because they're always lacking in some areas.
---
Power chronomancer lacks nothing and excels at everything.
---
As a Starbound fan, I almost saw the same sort of toxicity that I felt almost ruin the development of the game. Is the claim relevant if Guild Wars 2 is still alive six years later? I think it's a testament to how much Reddit really does and doesn't affect a game. If it were up to Reddit concensus, EGS should already be dead, too.
---
I think it does affect the part of the community that browses Reddit, but people who enjoy the game still play it - they just don't participate in those parts of the communityy.
---
&gt;underwater combat
---
That's a pretty exotic term. What does it mean?
---
Aions aerial combat was awful. No thanks.
---
Instead they should update the underwater combat and content, it's basically the same (because of the additional axis) and is already there.
---
You called it a 'strong independent type' stereotype.  In what way was Kalla 'independent'?  She trained a secret army of female Charr to join an uprising against the Flame Legion and unexpectedly turn the tides, buoying the other legions to victory.  She's strong, sure, but there's nothing 'independent' about what she did.  She was a cog in the machine, as all good Charr are.
---
So is your problem simply that she's a strong character?
---
I normally prefer using my Ranger for open world shenanigans :D the fantasy of trekking it out with my animal companion has always been appealing to me
---
This game has no content and anet is not pushing new stuff fast enough to justify sub fee.
---
mount maelstrom, variety, mobs, looks and great vista spots
---
Nah now I'm DJ dad lol I play baby shark 247
---
Guardian or Necromancer.
---
Well, it has been 250 years...
---
Smokescales can go die in a fire. When on earth am I supposed to be able to hit those fuckers?
---
Condi soulbeast - for solo content, *nothing* beats having a pocket revival in form of your pet.
---
Oh boy, I have some news for you!
---
The other thing is that a trade off can be fun/interesting ... or not.
---
That's probably the best it could be realistically, i get free content and they get some money from people who actually pay money for skins
---
Again , same thing. That's a new weapon in 2 different slots , which is 2 new weapon options for one elite.
---
I'd rather be able to use aquatic weapons on land. There are so many terrestrial uses for a harpoon.
---
That's one of the reasons why I want classic questing back, just to see other people while you do stuff.
---
GW2 could reinvent quests using a hybrid between map meta events and classic story instances, making them repeatable (daily reset after completion) with branching paths depending on personal options or performance.
---
For example, you might have to choose between saving A or B, and then the quests changes. Or you might have to save A, but have a failure option that changes the whole quest. That kind of stuff would be awesome, and doable  through player-activated dynamic events.
---
Other players would be able to join you in your quest, or just start theirs. That's what MMOs should be about.
---
Obsidian Sanctum is like the poor man's mistlock sanctuary.  You can get there from any PvE map, vendor and bank access in a nice compact area (sadly no crafting) and when you leave you're right back where you were on the PvE map.  I use this all the time on my alt account.  It keeps your toons parked at jumping puzzle/harvesting areas but still gives them bank access.
---
First, there's no vertical progression. If you bought lvl 80 exotic gear from the trading post, you won't drop better than this stat-wise. 
---
There's one tier above it, ascended, so you can take a look on it at the Wiki page. Your first ascended set will be through crafting or buying with raid tokens, don't expect to drop a Full set of ascended in a short period of time. 
---
Legendaries are technically a tier above ascended but they have the same stats as ascended gear.
---
There's no content for 2 people if you're expecting dungeons or things like that. Fractals are 5man dungeons and raids are 10man. You can do achievements together, some also reward with ascended gear. Do the story, try PvP/wvw, collections/achievements.
---
Also search for some new player/lvl 80 guides on YouTube, there is a few out there.
---
Telling unknown people what they will enjoy is sometimes considered rude
---
Sure being elitist is toxic. But you can be toxic in other ways, without being elitist... But i'm sure you are not that dumb and your just trolling.
---
You are missing the point though. Come back when you have a reply thats not random and actually adresses my post maybe?
---
Hear hear. Until Auric Basin, every map felt too bland and discolored compared to Caledon Forest.
---
Tybalt, introduction

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
Did he lose his job, or just quietly disappear? OP best be careful, the skritt are watching back.
---
Ooooh, that explains a lot. I was using plain old carrier bees.
---
With how saturated that area is with dense offices, you would have to work REALLY hard and do some serious in-person stalking to find them.
---
we are talking about gw2 ffs... we are used to be disappointed...
---
One of the things it offered last time was the ability to convert materials into the festival's loot bag, which helps balance material prices (somewhat).  You can pick up a loot bag for a single ectoplasm, and then also for other varying amounts of materials.  Two Hardened Leather Sections might get you a loot bag, or 85 Silver Ore, or 30 Hard Wood Logs, and so on.  So depending on what the prices they set are, you might want to turn some of your extra material stockpiles into loot bags, or alternately sell them to other players who'll be looking to turn them into loot bags.
---
I don't recall there being any really lucrative scenarios like the 5x Jorbreakers each 5 days that you could sell on the Trading Post, but you never know.  Every time they set things up along those lines, they're removing gold from the economy via Trading Post fees, so it's in their best interest to try to set something along those lines up.
---
Yeah. Brasa is ember, right? and Abrazo is hug.
---
&gt;First, there's no vertical progression. If you bought lvl 80 exotic gear from the trading post, you won't drop better than this stat-wise.
---
I mean this set cost me 10g at most, for every piece, and it's... not visually pleasing. I mean, for most of the story it's been the same chainmail/pirate/bandit/gladiator looking stuff, where do people get other sets of armors with acceptable end-game stats? Is it dungeons? I'm 100% talking about the non-gemstore fashion endgame here. 
---
&gt;There's one tier above it, ascended, so you can take a look on it at the Wiki page. Your first ascended set will be through crafting or buying with raid tokens, don't expect to drop a Full set of ascended in a short period of time.
---
I've been told to finish HoT first, is it needed or can we just farm for ascended?
---
&gt;  There's no content for 2 people if you're expecting dungeons or things like that. Fractals are 5man dungeons and raids are 10man. You can do achievements together, some also reward with ascended gear. Do the story, try PvP/wvw, collections/achievements. 
---
I mean, I know there's no official 2-man content in the game, but is there no content meant for more players that's doable by 2 man? We play the hell out of destiny too, and we were able to 2-man scourge of the past, a "6 man raid" bc it's the only raid that doesn't have mechanics requiring more players, i'm sure we could 2-man other raids if they didn't need "player A goes here, player B here and the others do this stuff simultaneously". We tried to 2-man caduceus manor at around lv 50 but things didn't go stellar. Maybe with ascended stuff at level 80 it's doable?
---
Of course stock prices will always go DOWN when there is a flop, many games flopped and many stocks went DOWN either.
---
That's an interesting idea for a project. 
---
I'm not making any promises but I might look into something like that in my spare time.
---
Ascended have 5% higher stats than Exotic but it is minimal.
---
I log in every now and then to play with my guild cause it's a bunch of great people that makes it enjoyable to play wvw for a day. And that's about it.
---
It will vary from build to build. To be really specific, the optimal balance of critchance vs power is
---
2100*CritChance = Power - 2100/(CritDamage-1)
---
As you can't really change ferocity much, let's assume your CritDamage is constant, say 2.5 (which is reasonable for an optimised build without food/banners/AP). Let's also say we want to critcap. For this to be optimal, we would need 3500 power. This isn't impossible, but you'd probably need an optimised solo build to manage it.
---
If we look at OP as an example of your average open world player, they're looking to beef up their survivability a bit. Maybe to do this they sacrifice some ferocity and some traits and now their CritDamage is only 2. To make aiming for critcap worthwhile they now need 4200 power, which IS impossible. 
---
Of course, there will be some builds that mess with this - a thief running invigorating precision for example - but as a general rule power is a better investment stats-wise than precision.
---
Would it be possible to update the binding options for TacO? Or allow modifier keys? I hate when I accidentally create a marker and then have to fish to remove it :V
---
Those really are some solid ideas you got there!
---
People objected to trying to make it a esports not trying to make the PvP fun, balanced, and competitive.
---
I've been dabbling in the topic for quite some time [(for reference)](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/18677/do-raids-need-easy-normal-hard-difficulty-mode-merged/p1), but I'm kinda rusty since I just stopped caring. I'll dig out the old stuff if you elaborate on your own ideas though :D.
---
My friends are playing on a full server, how long can i expect to wait before i can transfer to it so i can WvW with them? I'm rather lonely on my current server.
---
So it sounds like they are making an expansion-sized announcement but its for living world... Its gotta be massive
---
It's just a "high score" approach versus a "perfect run" approach.
---
In a high score model, most players complete the content, but they replay it to get the best score. In a perfect run approach, only a few complete it, and there's barely any differences between each player's run.
---
... I wish, if only so that everyone can reposition out of those most obnoxious AoE effects.
---
In a situation in which your input cannot tell you whether you should do or do not something, the safest choice is inaction.
---
Raictals? No no, Fractaids?  Definitely not. Fraids?  I'm partial towards Fraids, actually.
---
Can't answer everything right now, but sure, you definitely can take on most fractals with 2 man if you so desire, same for regular dungeons, as an example. For visual appealing skins, you should check the wardrobe, it's located in the bank. Check what skins do you like and search the Wiki for the aquisition methods, you can use the ingame command /wiki "name of the item" without the "".
---
Maybe I'll go and add in a link to the [Attribute combos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations) page but the icons are just what they made using the insignias as a base. I could list them all... Maybe I'll make a separate page that uses the insignia icons (don't want to clutter the guide too much I think)
---
I mean yes, he would be cool, but we have uneven Evil to Good Legends, so another Villian would be nice
---
Unfortunately, I’d like to preface this by saying anet will just never do this because they very clearly don’t want to sink any resources into challenging content and all future raids are likely  just going to be closer to your proposed tier 1 “LFR” style difficulty. 
---
4 difficulties is. A lot. This is coming from a WoW player, four is a lot of fucking difficulties, three MAX: one similar to WoW’s LFRs, one with the current difficulty used in non cm encounters and one similar to WoW’s Mythic or FFXIV’s Savage, on the level of Dhuum CM if not harder. Copying other games is fine, don’t fix it if it ain’t broke. If I were in charge and this was literally any other game I’d remove tier 1 and just have the 2, but since GW2 is so casual oriented I’d put it in (I also argue for WoW’s LFR to be removed all the Damn time but half of the playerbase does LFR compared to the way less percentages of normal and above).
---
Also, at this point in the game’s lifespan, these changes won’t do anything. Hardcore players are leaving by the droves after the new wing being way too easy, they’ve lost hope for anything decent and they’re jumping ship to other games (just like I have over a year ago), these harder difficulties are just going to be dead on arrival. 
---
Sorry to be so doom and gloom but the truth is the truth.
---
Guardian, mesmer, or necromancer. They're the best three at the moment, imo.
---
I think Caledon and Metrica have beautiful aesthetics. Really all the starter maps do a fantastic job of condensing the "suburb look" of the races. Then probably some of the maps with the Brand in them. Iron Marches comes to mind, but I'm pretty sure I am also thinking of areas in some other maps and attributing them to Iron Marches. Core Dragonbrand does, I think, some more interesting things with the environment. A lot of PoF Branded map sections tends to just be giant crystals everywhere but if you look at Core Brand there's a lot of great levitation/fragmented buildings. There's certainly some of that but it's not consistent. And then I think Orr has a certain appeal. It wasn't my favorite at launch, but time has made me pretty fond of the unique kind of dilapidated Orr has become. You very rarely see a fantasy city sunk and then raised back up.
---
Necro is probably the best candidate of the remaining non-Rev classes to have potential as a base class due to Death Shroud being so fully unique. However, this is the exception to the rule, and ANet's balance team hates Necro so good luck making it usable. Warrior is probably next in line, though the maxed out adrenaline skills would need to be much more impactful. Both of these are theoretically fixable with buffs to the core classes.
---
Guardian virtues and Mesmer shatters are absolutely not reasons to pick the classes. Engineer's profession mechanic is itself a tradeoff excuse for not having weapon swap (since your utilities can be kits which are your weapon swap replacement, so you get a utility replacement in the toolbelt). Stolen skills on Thief are largely uninspired (except for their souped up raid versions), Ranger pets are more annoying than anything unless they're afk-tanking trash mobs in open world, and core Ele doesn't even really have a defining mechanic compared to dual attunements and overloads.
---
You're also not adding power creep. The power creep happened years ago with elite specs. The target power level is static.
---
Mind you, for the record, I don't even think this is necessary. I'd rather ANet spent their time making more elite specs than trying to invent mechanics to nurse core classes back into relevance.
---
Not even Blood Magic for me. Going fully into damage it's so fun watching clouds of mobs evaporate as you spin into them. Run into a group, spectral grasp them all, spin, watch all that loot come in.
---
The revenant legend has nothing to do with the plot of the game. I vote Trahearne so we can finally get greatsword on Rev.
---
I'm rich, you know!
---
For all the pre-PoF story, I must say that Herald was my absolute favorite because they have perma swiftness and - before they changed it in the latest patch - superspeed. All the walking in slow motion was just absolutely frustrating. It's also very neat if you don't have access to mounts yet. Herald with Glint/Jalis legends is also pretty tanky for world bosses. The glint heal skill will make you pretty much invunerable for 3 seconds so you can, for example, escape the posion fields at Tequatl or the electric field of the Golem Mark II before they kill you. Or you just stand back and AA with the hammer (1.200 range). All in all it's a very chill and easy class, but can be boring to some.
