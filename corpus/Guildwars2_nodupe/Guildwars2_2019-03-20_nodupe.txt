i rarely pve, but my best suggestions is to group up, and communicate
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
the enjoyment comes from smashing towers/keeps after strategic usage of seige and land force. 
---
its the camaraderie that makes me wanna stay alongside with all the salt that the enemy cannot hear. 
---
also, imagine running lootbags. 
---
---
---
But does this also work the other way around?
---
Start channeling to get the "normal" bar and get quickness mid-channel.
---
yeah for now i've decided to not buy either of the expansions. i've also been hearing that the game has been dying a bit
---
oh there have been sales where you can buy both for $25? do you have any idea when the next sale might be? 
---
this is a good idea, i'll look into this. thanks!
---
I think its just best to look at Season 3 Episode 6 as the filler beach episode of the series, where the plot doesn't matter.
---
Their sofware is an embedded browser inside a window, basically, which is why it needs the even the GPU to render stuff and it's what lowers the FPS. They should had code it in QT C++ like TeamSpeak did.
---
Nah, Xiuquatl looks way better
---
Some runes and amulets are locked by default. You don't need to use presets, go take a look at metabattle.com
---
Who cares about fun anyway.
---
Aw, that’s such a cute hacker 
---
You can trade in skirmish tickets for ascended armor that is stat-selectable.  That's how I got my full ascended minstrel set.  It will take longer but you can earn it just by playing a lot, which is cool.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Hero%27s_armor  
---
Also requires completing the Triumphant armor reward track for each piece.  The reward track alone will let you get exotic minstrel gear as well.
---
On the contrary scourge is excellent for both wing 1 and 2. It's particularly good for gorse epi orbs, sabatha epi adds and sloth epi the slubs. Plague signet is also useful on sloth and Matthias. Anyone that botos a decent scourge from these wings for being a necro is simply an idiot.
---
That's a different issue altogether.
---
oh...  I just grab weapons from a vendor.  I didn't know.

---
Hey guys, so I'm pretty new to GW2. I have a level 80 weaver and it turns out they're pretty squishy. I'm getting annihilated by personal story Path of Fire stuff. Anytime there's more than a few mobs it becomes difficult and I need like a GORILLION apm to stay alive.
---
Am I just bad or are they indeed squishy and I need to just play super slow again veteran mobs and large groups of enemies?
---
Tempted to just play another class that can solo content easier. Ranger?
---
Heal Scourge and Condition Bannerslave Warrior are my top two picks. Fairly simple in terms of button pressing/rotation (mostly auto attacking, though the condi BS war can be TLDR'd as having torch 4 and 5 on cooldown, fill with sword autos (sword 3 thrown in when the target is sub 50% HP) till adrenaline is full for the LB rotation of going into F2's Berserk state and using auto attacks, LB3, and LB4 as you spam off Primal F1's, using Shattering Blow and Headbutt utility and elite skills when needed).
---
These two I can say you can get away with actual skill clicking, or clicking on the skills on your hot bar with the mouse.
---
Because it's an achievement for that mount and that mount is "the WvW mount". That doesn't change the fact that 75% of that achievement is done in the open world.
---
&gt; By the way, read the edit of my last comment.
---
Nah. The fact that you feel your comment required needed to be changed, pretty much eliminates any chance of it being interesting. 
---
Making it a side task sort of deal would have been pretty sweet. I wonder if there are simply limitations in the coding that prevent a task heart from being not included towards map completion though.
---
My performance was quite similar to stuff like world bosses in PvE with tens of players.
---
I have a desktop though, not super powerful by today's standards but cooling isn't an issue.
---
This is a thing yet you will still see people like Teapot say necro is fine. Yea, sure, it can do enough for raids, so can power herald. But that doesnt mean its enough to not make it an underpowered class. I do agree with that crew though that other classes should get nerfed down, not necro buffed up.
---
Try using the "-clientport 80" [command line argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments). It made a huge difference for me.
---
So much stability he becomes unstable
---
Hey you know the "Legacy Armor Reward Track" gives you a free piece of stat selectable gear including Mistrals as a possible selection. That should cut down a TON on costs. You can also buy exotic Clerics weapons and armor at spawn for &lt;1g each.
---
As long as you have those nobody will ever know. They'll just be glad to see another guardian.
---
Hilarious.

Oh, just figured that people would comment on the later parts of the post since they are the most interesting imo. 
---
chali, this isn't about some major game breaking mount properties like being able to jump over walls, this is simply about the no-mount zones in jumping puzzles. there literally is nothing intricate about this.
---
is this a copy pasta or something i dont get it..cant be real
---
Finding it hard to grind a Ranger and hearing that they’re not super useful in WvW. Should I carry on? Im too used to my guardian playstyle 
---
If you have extra karma grab the gathering tools that reward more wood.
---
Whatever he said seemed to piss them off.
---
I can squeeze out quite some more frames by disabling player names.
---
I think its enjoyable to have a little bit of gear progression, ascended armor/weapons are optional but slowly getting the right stats for a build over time feels satisfying. Thats one reason i enjoy playing on alt accounts on different servers as my main have easy access to all the best gear already.
---
Ranger is not typically used in zergs (large WvW groups) and would only really be useful as a roamer (small 1v1 and 2v1 fights, flipping camps, killing transports). If your only desire is WvW then I would suggest any other profession besides thief (they are also a roamer). You can check out WvW specific builds and guides on [Vabbi's site](http://builds.vabbi.org).
---
Guardian's free block and passive healing can lead to so bad habits while leveling, usually it comes down to learning to dodge and avoid damage. Can also use your pet to tank for you and just ranged DPS till you get the hang of it. 
---
If you're finding the leveling slow make sure you're killing enemies that have been alive for a while (usually yellow named ones), doing events, and using exp booster (usually just food and utility but actual boosters as well if you have them).
---
and that’s ok.
---
Here’s the main wiki link
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page
---
Hmm That looks pretty normal for playing on an EU server from the US.
---
The in game ping display includes server processing time so that means a large majority is issue on the server.
---
Contact support and include the image. Hopefully that is enough to get them to go take a look. :/
---
How's the weather over there?
---
Yes... Just like there's a NA server.
---
I've had the opposite experience, every time I've tried to play there has been no squad to join so basically stuck wandering only to die to an enemy zerg.
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky with timing but it hasn't been great for me thus far :(
---
Welcome to WvW guys, where shit like this gets to live for weeks if not years for some :)
---
2 weeks in WvW now with this bug that has existed since PoF launch.
---
Usually in pugs DPS is never really the issue, moreso a lack of proper handling of mechanics or CC. 
---
If you know what you are doing, full zerker staff weaver memeing is hilarious in any defence situation at least. In any situation where there is enough pressure/peel to keep the enemy zerg focused on somewhere else/away from you, full zerk ele is hilarious especially if you bomb downs and then you down heaps of them trying to res.   
---
Of course trying to run a standard comp with a full zerk ele will probably just get you killed a lot.
---
The dragon is a funny idea... and if it helps to get some bucks for the game I am totally fine with it. My only concern is the blood pressure of this poor fella... I mean he is upside down half of the time. But most likely he isn't even really alive ... I smell asuran technology. Polymock figure outlet \*cough\*
---
Necros are one of the classes with the most utility though... 
---
...Do you actually play Reaper because I seriously cannot believe someone who has says that *Holosmith* is better than Reaper at generating its own boons, considering that Reaper has an extremely easy time generating its own Might and Quickness? There's a reason people consider Reaper one of the *best* solo classes. 
---
Holosmith can generate *some* quickness, but nowhere near as much as Reaper. Reaper does might and quickness with ease compared to Holo, and as shown, Holo and Reaper are really close when it comes to their end numbers in their benchmarks. 
---
Besides that, the guy you're responding to you is better than you. Better than most people, too. He knows his stuff to a degree far better than either of us ever will. 
---
Is this game shit?
---
OP says he enjoyed raids and asked for classes with easy rotations. What does PvP have to do with any of that, and don't whine when he gets answers to his questions... 
---
We often raid asking for more necro's and actively avoid double druid comp. Much better.
---
Pretty good, honestly. It starts a little slow, but once it gets going, it's really damn good. There's a lot of stuff I miss from GW2, but I burnt myself out on it playing on and off since launch, and I don't know if I'll ever come back.
---
If you've got Twitch Prime, they're giving away the base version of XIV and a month's sub until May, and if it sinks its claws into you like it did me, the next expansion's out in July.
---
Why is it called good Lodge? I really thought something like Hunter's lodge was released for guild.
---
Hell ya! Thanks :)
---
It's just your mind playing tricks on you
---
Tetsuya Nomura needs that hair style back so he can make more Kingdom Hearts characters
---
Thats literally the opposite of what he asked for 
---
Lots of wvw players just turn their graphics settings right down.  Try it.
---
This game is dead if they dont release expansions asap. Its dead for lot of people already but it will be official soon if they didnt.
---
And you are doing it right. Discovering is part of this game. You can't go wrong while lvling and you should test and explore everything. 
---
I don't see anything there.
---
Trying to get something and trying to have fun while doing it is mutually exclusive?
---
In addition to numerical sort, you could include an "index" like a leading character initial. If you've got a DPS guardian named Jeff and a support one named Steve, you could have your templates be
---
Jeff: Righteous Instincts DH
---
Jeff: Perfect Inscriptions DH
---
Jeff: Power Quickbrand
---
Steve: Heal Firebrand
---
Steve: Heal+Quickness
---
Steve: Condi+Quickness

&gt;RYL
---
I've recently started playing Return of Warrior, but it just doesnt compare to what RYL 1 was back in the day.  
---
RYL was such a simple game but it was something special. All these new servers keep trying to add too much and it just breaks the game.  
---
I remember the launch day of RYL 2 and how excited everyone was.   
---
Running into players you knew but as a new class. I quickly realised I needed a new graphics card and ran out  to get one that day to make sure I didnt miss too much.   
---
I still played RYL 2 a load but it ultimately lacked the appeal for some reason..  
---
Lol, the hivemind is real
---
I just want him to be _not_ a human. Like he's been a Mesmer hiding all along because he's been scouting for some other race. 
---
They also spent 90% of the time dealing with them in LS3 having people say "assuming there aren't more Mursaat in the Mists" with wink at the camera just to drive the point home.
---
Personally I think they know how badly they made the Mursaat as a faction, and wanted to kill off the last of the Mursaat from Kryta so they can introduce other Mursaat later who aren't affiliated.
---
Considering how uniform and evil they were, I could see them having a new pack of mursaat try to say that the mursaat we knew from GW1 were a sub-faction of the species rather than all of them. Much like they did with the Flame Legion =/= other Charr in GW1 -&gt; GW2.
---
Does it go away forever if you touch it?
---
Are you being a fucking idiot just to be one? I clearly mentioned why slippery slope contributed to the issue. Even when we were able to work around the bug with the fractal, slippery slope made it so that we slipped off the block as soon as we landed due to momentum. 
---
Why are reaper players so fucking stupid in comparison to everyone else.
---
Yeah, Staff gets most of the unique weapon skins. Like five scythes in the last year, the Hydra staff, the pig staff, the emissary staff, and a bunch others. Meanwhile, the only gem scepter I can think of is the peacock one. 
---
Only in PvP and WvW for me. 
---
Quite common with large zergs in WvW too where ping spikes straight to 1.3-2.5k only, outside of that, no problems at all. 
---
Well good news, the SC benchmark is in fact misleading, it's even worse in real raids.
---
So what I get from what you said is that I can buy any of the expansions but it's up to me when I want to play the lore stuff I get from them, meaning I can buy the expansion now and wait til I get Living Worlds to continue the lore from the expansions. Is this correct?
---

If anyone wants try out Freestyle and don't know where to start try these settings I've been tweaking.

#Colour
---
Tint colour: 0%
---
Tint intensity: 0%
---
Temperature: -10 (Makes skyboxes in the desert look better)
---
Vibrance: 20-40 depending on your taste. I'd take the middle ground of 30 to start and work from there
---
#Detail
---
Sharpen: 0-5% (this gives a grainy effect the further tot he right you go
---
Clarity: 70% (Wouldn't mess with this one)
---
HDR Toning: -40-70% depending how dark you want the shadows/darkness to be
---
Bloom: 0-5% (this can lead to more visual clutter the further you increase)
---
Make sure you go with post processing at at least low.
---
This is so accurate

Had a pug necro join a few days ago, advertised for DPS, they came in as a support dps hybrid, it was a matter of, we had our supports and I don't want a limp dick pug not pulling their weight, I have nothing against Necro's whatsoever but at least come in with something relevant, not half baked 15k maximum POSSIBLE DPS, it's just unrealistic and more toxic than me kicking, and that's the PoV of most comms currently. Necro seems to be the most common problem class when it comes to this. 
---
Wut okay holo has fury. But really if boons are bad 25 capped might and a extremely higher uptime on quickness + crit capped in shroud is far better than having fury. Like really are you serious. Being capable to provide everything yourself makes reaper such a good pick when pugging where boons can be bad.
---
Correct. The expansions take place in new maps you will have to intentionally go to. It doesn't change anything in the core Tyria or living world maps. When you buy them, you will have entries appear in your personal story tab for each of the expansion storylines. You have to go here and click to play the story before the NPCs you need to talk to to begin the quests will even appear in the world. They won't automatically start.
---
Plenty if groups are happy to have you on exotics until you're ascended geared. I've been playing an old Marauder's Dragonhunter build while I work on my set and can have plenty of fun.
---
Just block them all and you won't see them in LFG anymore.
---
Go to any bank NPC and there you can look at your bank inventory, crafting materials inventory, and wardrobe previews. Select wardrobe previews and you can right click -&gt; preview any piece of armor that your character can wear. You can filter by type (heavy, med, light), and piece (head, chest, foot, etc) to see which armor you like the most. Some of them are only unlockable for certain races or DLC or achievements so keep this in mind.
---
Dyes, you can buy on the TP. Or if you want them for free you can play WvW and tag along with a Commander Tag to earn skirmish rewards periodically, using the chest will give you a menu with options to trade it in for tokens for certain WvW purposes or for an unidentified dye, etc. If you want dyes this is an easy free way to get them. I personally just buy them off TP or earn them randomly. 
---
For the makeover kits (which are quite nice because they provide some exclusive hair/eye/accessory colors as well as exclusive [and sometimes prettier] faces) you can start a new character every once in a while and only do the low level story. People farm black lion chest keys this way by doing a human character 1x a week, since the key drops are abysmally low compared to the chest drops. You can earn statuettes this way or just play the game normally/casually and earn them slower. 
---
If I recall correctly, they were twice the height and width of your screen resolution. It took my computer a couple of seconds to process them, but the results were great!
---
If you had full berserker exotics with ascended weapons and trinkets then that commander doesn't have a clue about what he is talking about. That is more than enough for training. 
---
Full ascended armor would only add 2% more dps. 
---
Heya 
---
When i start whit a Character i go after the following steps:
---
1 Idea for a design
---
2 tryout stuff in the bank wardrobe collection
---
3 when i found what i want search 4 the items i dont own in the gw2 wiki
---
4 get the items whit the help from the wiki
---
The colors is somthing i just farm .... be aware that some look almost as a expensive 1 but are cheaper. U can test them in the TP. 
---
U can farm the transmutations in pvp.
---
The styling kits are not that expensive as u might think just farm them and tread gold to gems.
---
Hope that this was a little help
---

Which stats are your exotics/ascendets? 
---
My theory is that the dude's from Utopia the land from that scrapped GW1 expansion. It was supposed to be themed around Central America and he's the only human we've ever seen with a vaguely Hispanic sounding name.
---
If I join a pug with preaper and people start complaining, I often make them the deal that if im not top 3 dps ill switch to something they like. Even then if im not top 3 but still 5k ahead of some pug holo you dont hear them anymore
---
ESO's world just feels so lived in. My biggest beef with GW2 is that the world and maps feel empty besides almost constantly being dragged into combat encounters. There's not a lot of quiet spaces in maps that sort of just are or people to talk to or homes that feel like different people actually live in them.
---
-&gt;  /r/GuildWars
---
The sunspears were reduced to small groups hiding and wandering, and that was well developed in the Movement of the World.
---
The reason we see them as a faction in Istan is because Joko was missing for the duration of the forged invasion, which heavily stressed Elona's economy. Food shortages became a thing, with the Istani nobles hoarding all the food that wasn't sent north to Vabbi or Kourna. Thus sections of Istan Rebelled, and the few sunspears there suddenly found themselves with an army to train and form.
---
Humans can handle Centaurs, especially since the troubles all came from sabotage, which was dealt with. 
---
Again, the sunspears were not any sort of army until Istan started a full rebellion against Joko, before that point you had lone wanders or pairs mostly. Look at those you get to go to the last Spearmarshalls resting place, it's like five people total and IIRC, we only know of six named sunspears who were active north of Kourna. Post Rebellion, the ones in Istan started getting recruits.

If you’re inexperienced with raiding and want to learn, I’d recommend checking out dedicated raid training discords first. Snowcrows lists a few [here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/)
---
Highly underrated comment.
---
I don't think he had his greatsword during the episode where he gets revealed. He could've been going back to the Reliquary to recover his weapon.
---
I think it's more of "Lazarus revived where the ritual was completed" As his soul/spirit was split into the various items. He wasn't in Tyria until the aspects were all brought together allowing him to return.
---
damn it, I HAVE A LEGENDARY SCEPTER WITH A PET ATTACHED, i cant buy this now
---
Get better at dodging and learning your class' evades/blocks/blinds so you can mitigate damage actively, along with understanding which of your skills CC
---
Apparently it only exists client-side too, so only you are seeing it.
---
This exactly. Move during combat, don’t stand in AoEs, rebound your skills (you should never have to click a skill with your mouse), learn CCs, and dodge attacks. 
---
Ok.  I played GW1 from the month it was released.  This was meant for GW2 players who were a part of GW1 to feel the nostalgia or the loss of a full guild, that turned into this because of where life is now.  It wasn't meant for current GW1 players that may not be a part of what the game used to be. :)
---
warrior with defence trait shoud be imortall on all these maps.
---
now i normally don't really like newcomers to WvW, bcz they are ignorant and won't listen to why communicating and such is better, but this made me giggle. 
---
But how do you make mechanics that are instant kills easier? Would Sabetha's Flamethrower just down a player? Would the bubble on Xera not matter? Would missing a Reaper on Dhuum just damage its health? If you make mechanics hit for less, or adjust them to allow a margin of recovery, you aren't providing much of a training platform.
---
Additional people in a raid allows for the mechanics to be covered by more people or for more people to die to the mechanics and the fight still be successful. 
---
Legacy of the Foefire.

Worst change ever made.

Tried different browsers? Have you checked your Route? Can you login ingame?
---
[removed]
---
I have tried on my PC using google chrome and also my iPad using safari. Both login screens are blank white pages.
---
I can log into game I just can't access the account page on GW2 website
---
All: Mistlock Sanctuary because I don't have to run half a map or switch maps to get to x npc. Armistice Bastion isn't bad either.
---
Storytelling? Hmm, I think Jahai Bluffs did it for me with the ton of references to GW1 and other GW2 events.
---
In terms of beauty, I guess I'm a bit different. I can appreciate Tangled Depths, but The Desolation is my favourite. Domain of Vabbi comes close too.
---
Exploration, I'd vote for Verdant Brink, as it's so freaking huge with the vast number of levels you can fight at. Jahai also comes close because of the references.
---
Rewards-wise, I'd say Bitterfrost Frontier for Winterberries. Or maybe Lake Doric, as you can both farm Jade Shards and Bloodstone-Warped Hides.
---
Design and exploration wise, Draconis Mons. That map was a blast for me to explore, and doing the collection for those little shards around the map was great. So many secret little areas I'd have never found! A close second is tangled depths. The complicated nature is exactly why I love the design. It takes skill to make a map with so many twists and turns and still have a semblance of sense. Storywise, I like Vabbi. After going through the chaos of awakened in the desolation, it's a sudden calm. The whole place feels a bit like a horror scene where the neighborhood is too friendly, but misinformed. 
---
I really miss the pirate feel of the city. 
---
How would a better lfg system help if players cant even use a plain textbox?
---
7% with infusions :O that's not negligible.
---
Just kidding, exotics to start in wvw is more than enough, and except for really hardcore gvg guilds not many guilds require ascended builds when you start out with them anyway.
---
whats so awsome did someone test it with the diretx 12 proxy?
---
I love how in their presentation slides they have the squiggly lines for misspellings under HDR.
---
Thats the difference between necro mains and dh meta slaves. A good dh will easily pull ahead of a reaper in the kc burstphases but people seriously overestimate the dimensions this will occur in. If you pug raids already you wont even notice the seconds that you just saved by replacing the reaper with a dh.
---
Anyway, people shouldn‘t be kicked because of their class. They should be kicked because of their performance instead.
---
Thank you, gives me some confidence back :).
---
Been playing guardian since the Beta Weekends but the last two/three years were more sporadic than anything else, still hoping for a Monk Elite Spec.
---
I’d personally say Silverwastes or Verdant Brink, just because the metas are so ingrained in their design. They almost feel like their own mini-games. I’d love to see more non-stop story driven meta maps in the game. Especially if they did one with more dire consequences for failure, and perhaps some randomized or AI driven event branches (especially if they changed the meta’s finale in a meaningful way) that would further push that feeling of being in a living battlefield. 
---
From an NA perspective, I don’t really see this as much. People in my experience are only kicked if their DPS choice is particularly egregious (I.e. condi scourge at KC or power reaper at something like largos). 
---
That being said, I generally agree. Not wanting off-meta DPS is generally a given in super experienced PUGs, but a 250 LI group is hardly that at all. 
---
You mean Lobster's Arch :D
---
honestly then just join as daredevil, wait for the rest to die and then solo the boss over the course of 50 minutes
---
Great music +1. Exalted lullaby is the best in this game
---
Not really tho, real bosses have breakbars and if you abuse them correctly you end up with more damage than possible on a puppet.
---
Look up SC 99cm Video where they nuke the endboss from 100% to 66% and 66% to 33% all within the breakbar CDs. Your average pug group wont pull that of but you can at least allways use the double stun after 66%.
---
You can burst into those windows rather easily, hence SC brings 4 DDs and a chrono support. You don't need healers if the boss dies within his 5sec stun and can't even activate mechanics.
---
Normal pugs can't get there but top end players deal more damage (at least in fracs) than on Golem.
---
Ember bay came out of a twisted mind, especially when it comes to mursaat tokens
---
Hallenujja!
---
In terms of storytelling, it was the Destroyed LA Hub closely followed by the temporary camp they put up at Vigil HQ in Gendarran Fields. It made you feel like the story around you REALLY mattered. It even affected the players, having to move with their hub.
---
Design award goes to Desert Highlands, more specific the arid biomes. I'm a sucker for the aesthetic of such biomes and the calmness they have. No events there, no noise. Runner up is Restoration Refuge in Dry Top.
---
Exploration goes to Tangled Depths, hands down.
---
Rewards depend on what you want. Theres maps stuffed to the gills with rewards. Want T5 wood? Screw Multiwood, thats boring. Go to Sirens Reef instead and woops you find some chests with random stuff inbetween too, nice. Hey psst, want Platinum? Just run across Sparkfly Fen real fast. In terms of feeling rewarded for what you do however, I'd say Auric Basin including the meta event.
---
I also have the same problem :(
---
Arcdps meter addon
---
Well, you kinda come from a parallel world
---
Right, but do most power DPS classes bring that much utility ?
---
DH ? They have some tools, but usually stick to signet/trap/sword.
---
Weaver gets full DPS bar, so does holosmith.
---
You can certainly find one or two examples where a reaper is a very bad choice for a specific encounter/mechanics. But as a whole, considering the raids globally when you just need anonymous power DPS ? Nah.
---
At the end of the Burden of Choice plot line/achievement (started by touching the  Anomalous vision) you are given a choice. One option will permanently stop the vision appearing, the other will not. 
---
Nope sadly I am not. It's weird. If I spam refresh button I see the login page but it's only present for like 0.1 of a second and all of the boxes are in the top left of the screen as opposed to the centre middle like usual
---
When you go to that page, has it always been blank, or does it go blank after attempting to login?
---
guard/DH, thief, and war all bring much more to the table for the group.
---
powerreaper has one of the highest opening bursts and shitton of cc
---
Im playing reaper since the patch cause i like the memes and im regularly outdpsing anyone and doing mechanics.
---
Its not about the class but the players if he cant pull off the reaper burst he prob wont do it with dh or weaver either
---
&gt; Will be the same for PoF?
---
No. HoT has a lot of verticality because of Gliding. The maps are designed with that in mind so you have a lot of big and high maps in which you can glide a long time. PoF doesn't have that and is more open space with very little verticality.
---
Though, if you spent a lot of time on those maps you will get to know them. Anyone of us got lost in tangled depths the first few months.
---
Still waiting for facts, not random claims.

I have been unable to attempt to enter my login information once. This applies regardless of where I am redirected from. I can't log into the forums. I can't log into my account. Can't login to the store so I can buy the expansions which is what I'm attempting to do.

Mythical AI screenshot upscaling works fine but don’t think it’s needed (I can make 8k screenshots).
---
There's something so satisfying about pulling a pack of the little bastards and unleashing AoE hell. 
---
I can name a few people that enjoyed strictly griefing comms for several hours straight. You know the alt account throwing a siege cap of trebs at whatever objective you get to, pulling every tactivator available, tagging same colour on top of the actual comm to repeatedly suicide and bait plebs to chase the wrong comm. That kinda stuff.
---
In fact when wvw was more popular quite a few servers had their local troll they just couldn't get rid of.
---
Eventually either the comm or the troll alt f4 because the game isn't worth it. Nowadays nobody bothers because nobody cares anymore. Nowadays griefing is mostly done by clueless monkeys trying to help but too dumb to follow instructions and too dumb to realise they're not helping.
---
In a raid? 60% is fine because you will have another chrono so just spend some time on Golem learning rotation and it's GG. 
---
If you are going into a raid with no idea how to do the rotation because you haven't practiced it, 80% BD won't help you
---
You'll still need to access the zone to unlock the hero points, unless you're playing WvW enough. But you can just launch it, hop out the first instance, and explore without continuing the story.
---
&gt; OP doesn't owe you a debate.
---
I dont owe them praise or silence either.
---
&gt; If you understood from the initial comics that OP's character was an asura, then it shouldn't even be a question now because it's the exact same character. So trying to "gotcha" OP by saying you didn't know it was the same character and thought they were talking about a literal child and demanding they explain their word choice to your satisfaction is, well, a dick move on your part and I don't blame OP for not indulging you.
---
In the last comic, OP was clearly a norn or human female, not an asura. And OP isnt not only not indulging me, it seems they have little interest to discuss their art with anybody commenting on it or giving feedback, if you check their comment history in their own posts. 
---
&gt; And here you are again in this post saying that OP changed the nature of their post to the point of being unrelated to GW2 because they "started a moral discussion" with another joke comment, so I suppose at the very least I can commend you for your dedication to your bit here.
---
So in your opinion, if an artist tries to be funny and their audience doesnt think its funny, the audience shouldnt let the artist know?
---
&gt; There have been complaints about the OP's taste in humor since their first comic, but the response has been largely positive from what I've seen. And I'm not usually one to care about karma all that much, but the upvotes on these comics speak for themselves. The sub's moderators also don't seem to see these as violating any rules as far as content, effort, or relation to the game.
---
What are you suggesting here? That we shouldnt criticize content, if a majority likes it?
---
&gt; The sub's moderators also don't seem to see these as violating any rules as far as content, effort, or relation to the game.
---
The last post about cutting off breasts was hidden from this sub, just FYI.
---
Besides that, I dont think I explicitly demanded that OP stops posting their comics, all I did was ask some questions about their motives and give some further insight on their art. Sure, I said that if they dont want to get negative feedback or have no interest in discussing their art, they should maybe stop posting it on a discussion board but that has nothing to do with the content of the comics or their artwork itself but their personal behaviour.
---
 Omg, finally I found a word that describes my reaper playstyle! Bulldozer xD
---
I loved Verdant Brink too, the depth of the HoT maps is absolutely amazing. They were so exciting to explore. 
---
I agree . Spvp  , there are a few loudmouths. I hear someone run their mouth maybe once every 6 games , and it doesn't even matter , cause what can they do ? Where as , it's raiders themselves and their attitudes that keep people from raiding , not the raids or any difficulty. The reliance on Snowcrows and acting as if a speed clear meta should be normal , is ridiculous in the first place.
---
That is the thing with gw2. Core tyria and the personal story is not ment to provide any form of challenge. Silverwastes and Drytop - which are the entry point to expansion level content - are often skipped nowadays or only entered in huge zergs so you don't have to do hardly anything to stay alive. And than comes the first step into verdant brink and a huge oh-moment.
---
The skill ceiling - for every class and the game in general - is pretty high despites the limited options on you castbar. Gear and especially traits matters but also a general knowledge and understanding of the core game mechanics (defiance bars, dodging, telegraphing, boons and conditions). Besides what many others already said it often helps to get used to enemies in general. Some of them will force you to swap at least utilities on some classes and others - especially if you are trying to solo champs or group events - will demand much more. The more experienced you get, the easier it will get to get used to new unknown enemies. That is why many veterans are calling pof zones as to "easy" despite that pof enemies can still hit like a truck.
---
There was a balance patch months ago where Anet has given a little bit of inside with the introduction of this patch and it rougly said somethin like: The difference between a new player and a veteran lies in about five times the damage and ten times the survivability. So the best advice I can give is: Keep on trying. It will get better over time.
---
Go to major towns and look around, you'll find people with cool looking armor, you'll be like "damn he looks cool, i wanna try looking cool too", then you go to a bank &gt; wardrobe tab and choose your armor weight and look for a combo you like, look up the names on gw2wiki and go get them. Thats how it works, sometimes you need a couple of days to get smth and sometimes weeks but yeah good luck!
---
That is probably true. I just noticed a heavy drop in my quickness/alacrity uptime in pug raids and i am not sure where that comes from. I partially blame chrono veteran shortage and an influx of new chrono players that started a bit too early :/ 
---
That means you can't cheese the system by getting fractal/LWS3 trinkets for Pof stats, correct? My bad
---
First, raid is content for 10 ppl. If squad wants to increase chances to maximum by picking proper classes, they have rights to do that. Second, do you realy have fun by clearing all 20 raid encounters with 1 class? Maybe you should start to play chrono, you will free some graceful souls from chronojail. Because most ppl dont like to play 1 class, they like to swap. Everybody except necromancers, rly. Sometimes I feel like there are 2 kinds of ppl playing this game- ppl who like playing everything and swaping, and ppl who wants to play necro everywhere. Its very uncommon in high LI squad to find ranger or thief maniac who wants to clear everything with 1 class and only swap gear bitween condi to power. But almost every monday on reset I have 1 necro main who wants to join and prove necro is viable. It's plague, rly. It's the only class with such amount of lovers and haters. The problem is that there are too many noobs maining that and considering themselves as amazing players. When I see necro, my first thought isnt "oh no, out of meta class". It's rather "omg, another noob who cant alive with barrier or another health bar, who will prolly proceed some pseudorotation and provide low dps". Because it's true. 90% of ppl choose that cus they feel it's easier to alive, has minions to tank mobs etc. Ofc, there are true masters of thic class who can play, but why they dont want play anything else for god's sake? I know a lot of ele mains- they swap. I know ranger mains- they swap. Thiefs mains? They swap as well. Why should I let for necro play necro everywhere? Idk
---
PS. I am condi soulbeast main. Do you know when did I last time play this class? I don't remember. Do you know why? It's out of meta. Does it mean cSoulbeast doesn't have dps? No, there are just better classes, so I play them because I respect other ppls' time.
---
PPS. If ppl from chrono jail are forced to play something they dont want cus squad need boons, you should repay by picking the most efficient class. If you dont, you are selfish brat forcing other ppl to help you have more fun, and giving nothing in exchange
---
What do you find so insulting? Do you think TC is a hardcore strong server for ppting to T1? Especially when many servers actively avoid it and even in t2 tc generally gets farmed pretty hard?
---
The poster above you stated its great for casuals and not so much for others. You then state it's great but you're exactly the type of casual they're on about. But apparently that upsets you. 
---
Sorry, tc is super hardcore and one of the best servers ever. How could they not be? they're a t1-t2 server! Wouldn't wanna break your immersion and interrupt your rp &lt;3

It is always sad if fansites are shutting down. 
---
End of last year a long active english speaking community also ended their service and I know two german communities that also shut down in the past. It happens with guilds all the time but the good thing about guilds is: There will be always a new one. Fansites are costing money so it is very likely that their service will end some day.

Change my mind.

Unfortunately no, same with raids: I had an alt that only had HoT at start and I looted a Healer staff that had Harrier in the list of stats I could pick but if I selected it I couldn't click on "Accept" to actually have a Harrier staff but could for Minstrel for example.
---
gw2community closed down because of ego fights within the leadership side of things and the supposed community manager just went ahead to make his own "community" meme fully controlled by him because of his ego was too big for one game apparently.
---
In the long run "communities" are not really not needed for the game anymore at this point. Gw2 sadly has become a solo game where you just have some npc like players around you doing events with you, no communication or organizing needed from player side (with some exceptions with TT still and SI). And websites and forums are almost a waste of money with discord enabling way easier way of communicating with text.
---
All you're doing is being pedantic for the sake of being pedantic.  The breast thief, the "damn kid" OP mentioned, was the same asura that has been in every single comic they've made.  You aren't just asking questions, you're taking everything out of context and too literally to frame your trolling as innocent questions.   Unless you truly are that oblivious to simple phrasing, in which case you don't seem willing to hear any explanations.  But I'm willing to bet this act is amusing for you.  You wanted to know how this particular comic was related to GW2 and I explained it simply.  While arguing in circles may be entertaining for you, I'm bored of it.  So good luck with your "just asking questions" game.

FOV slider goes all the way to the left (most zoomed in) for screenshots, that's how real life portrait lenses are. [Check out my album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TjBffDwigDsxwLeT7)!

Personally I loved getting lost in the maps. I loved feeling like I was actually exploring, watching the scenery to understand where to go instead of the minimap.
---
Those maps, especially TD, become very easy to navigate once you have the relevant masteries and get used to them.
---
PoF maps are very easy to navigate and were a bit of a disapointment in that regard for me (although expected).
---
HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS, CHUNK!!!
---
I'd like reaper GS 2 to be similar to thief dagger 2 which fits in with the reaping the weak theme. DPS increase won't be enough to make it op too.
---
Also reaper utility on qadim is really nice.
---
Except higher dps potential? DH can provide great CC (Gs 5, ultimate trap, bane signet, even spirit hammer if squad needs more), pull, and even share his bane signet active effect and increase power for his subgroup. Thief has amazing cc skil (basilisk venom), magnetic bomb can provide cc or pull, detonate ectoplasm gives 11 boons. Warrior dps is nishe pick. I dont see a reason to look into him now. Necro has significantly lower dps than DH and thief, doesnt provide such cc, boons... But there are also "condi" bosses. Mirage's dps overhelms necro, it's fact
---
Nice to hear that!!
---
"-sell -[" filters out all listings for raid selling and some guild recruitements.

At least when I played, PvE was always far more profitable than WvW, in some cases PvP seasons became very profitable BUT that has nothing to do with WvW.
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
Every category has its own winner, IMO.  
---
If we take visuals alone, Bloodstone Fen is my favorite without a doubt, it's unlike any other map created by ANet. But it fails in most other aspects you described.  
---
Exploration-wise Lake Doric is really great, it has a lot of variety, hidden areas and collectibles, so it's worth it to walk around.  
---
Design-wise, I still think Silverwastes are the most interesting and interactive map, the meta is still amazing, even though I spent months farming it.  
---
I don't really farm stuff, so I don't know what's the most rewarding map.
---
Guild Wars 2 is a skilled based game. This means that you need to spend some time reading up on your skills and your build and how they can syngergy with eachother. In the expansions you need to be aware of what you can use to cleanse, stun break and how to kite and how to use the enviroment to your advantage. It is also important that you learn the mobs and what they do to you and what you can do to stop them from doing it. Dodge at the right time, blink away, stunning, fear, knockback (if you are alone, in groups knockbacks are shit), pulling, interrrupting and so on. What skills do you have that are aoe and what is single target and so on.
---
And remember all mobs have a aggro range so if one is on you and you don't want to kill it you can move away until the mob loose aggro on you, either by just running, being on a mount, blink, shadowstep, leap, dodge, or simply just jump off the cliff and glide away. 
---
It can be a bit overwhelming at the start and you just need to get used to it and learn by doing. We all been new to this maps and we all had to go through the learning process and after a while they are a map like any other map.
---
was genuinely disappointed that the other maps didn’t have the same level of vertical movement. it genuinely felt like flying, bring it back anet
---
Have the same issue and it gave a huge headache yesterday. Can't connect in-game too! 
---
We had a push with about 20-25 players on our keep in ebg last night and they were hard to kill but did little to no damage because of having to much support and no damage.  Was kind of funny to see actually.
---
Thanks for this, I tried Free Style and everything I did just made GW2 look horrible.
---
Has it worked at any point since yesterday? I assume you are an EU player too? 
---
I miss the days of 7necro one monk VQing. 
---
I feel like this is our (necro) penance.

---
the best story has vabbi. no question for me.
---
the cultural mix of undead and living is really great.
---
Pocket raptors are wholesome little dino nuggets, it's the mushrooms that must burn.
---
They are probably looking for meta builds. Is not just necro. Most elitist douchbags will not pick up a scrapper, core ele, shout healer warrior, etc.
---
It's just baffling something so obviously broken passes their QA (assuming it exists). This keeps happening again and again. I really hope the recent restructuring also brings more resources and focus to QA. 
---
I kinda like the verticality in the HoT maps but sometimes it just gets tedious and frustrating when I actually want to get somewhere fast.
---
Same here. Been tryin to login since this morning. Wanted to buy expansion and thats what i got... a day full of headache. Tried everythin (antivirus disabled/firewall disabled, different browsers, router resetting.. clearing cache/cookies..). Clearing cache/cookies was weird tho. For the duration while the cookies were clearing site got loaded up and i managed to login. Though webpage was kinda incomplete. Wasnt fully loaded.. But then again after cookies/cache got cleared the same thing persisted. Like 0.1second of a login screen and then poof BLANK. ANET hear us! Fix it please!
---
I'm in the UK and I can't log in to the forum either.  I'm at work so can't try the game to see if that's also the same.  Not sure if it's coincidence but 
---
my API is also showing as invalid on some areas of /r/gw2efficiency, although not all of them.  That's what prompted me to try and login and refresh my API.
---
Same here! EU account, can't login to client and can't login on forum/website.
---
I just get the blank screen aswell
---
&gt;  You wanted to know how this particular comic was related to GW2 and I explained it simply. 
---
I was interested in OP`s opinion, not your interpretation of it.
---
Imagine being this upset about a subreddit comic, not only once, but for weeks at a time. 
---
&gt; Would Sabetha's Flamethrower just down a player? Would the bubble on Xera not matter? Would missing a Reaper on Dhuum just damage its health? If you make mechanics hit for less, or adjust them to allow a margin of recovery, you aren't providing much of a training platform.
---
Those attacks would remain insta-killers, or just do high damage instead of insta-killing you. An easy mode needs to be easier, not different.
---
&gt;Additional people in a raid allows for the mechanics to be covered by more people or for more people to die to the mechanics and the fight still be successful.
---
You break up everything that make raids what they are by breaking the 10-man composition. You can't learn rotations or anything when the whole setup changes once you move to normal mode.
---
Draconis mons. Such a cool map 
---
Youre still wrong though. Golem has very high toughness (more than almost every if not every raid boss) so you can pull higher numbers on a boss. Look at vg phases for example. Vg has I think 634 toughness? You can shit out dps with a power class on that boss and go way over bench
---
Just because someone is asking questions about some art doesnt mean they are upset, I only asked OP how their art is related to GW2 because I failed to see the connection. I also only commented on their last 2 comics.
---
Draconis mons, I had great time doing the rock collecting achievement and swinging around the area with oakheart essences. At first the map was confusing as fug, but I fell in love with all the little hidden areas. I like map breaking, but that map offered me feel of it even though everything was still within the map
---
Imagine being this upset about a phrase that has been used for hundreds of years.
---
My favorite map, hmm, it’s a tie between Auric Basin, Blazeridge Steppes, Fireheart Rise, Bloodtide Coast, Mount Maelstrom, Bitterfrost Frontier, Draconic Mons, and the Desolation. But I like them all really.
---
A friend's theory is that the ley-lines the waypoints sit above act as conduit for you to travel through. So you can enter into the nearest ley-line from anywhere in the world but only exit at a waypoint which serves as a fixed connection between the world and the ley-lines.
---
Timberland falls, slowly descending from the snowy mountaintops to the lush green forests and calm rivers always has been a memorable and beautiful moment for me.
---
Asuran Magitech mixed with ley line energy. Lorewise, as u/jesselavender said, your character walks to the nearest WP and uses the floating crystal cube to get teleported to another.
---
Timberline Falls is such a beautiful map.
---
A so, in reality you'd have to go to the nearest waypoint before travelling. Like how you have to find the nearest flight master in wow before you can take a gryphon somewhere.
---
To expand upon this, one of the big downsides of this design approach is that you're constantly leaving gameplay elements behind. Love this thing? Too bad, its flavor of the week spotlight is over, we're doing this different thing now.
---
Find me a class that gets higher numbers on VG than it does on Golems, and link me logs to prove it. I'll wait because you're pulling bullshit out of your ass. Golem DPS will always be higher than boss DPS unless you're playing a class like Necro (Pre Epi Nerf), Mirage (due to bosses attacks making confusion hit harder), or Condi Holo/Daredevil (due to confusion for cHolo/whirl finishers for DD).
---
&gt;Still I don't get why you would choose willingly to play a class wich is openly hated and looked down upon.
---
Cause I enjoy the class?  Gawd forbid I play something I enjoy when I am gaming.  Fuck me right? 
---
The waypoints are tied up to the lay-lines of tyria, if you look at a map of the lay-lines projected om top of a map with the waypoints you will see there is a strong correlation between their locations. I highly recomend playing through ls s2 as this is a major plot point. We already know that Tyrians can use lesser lay-lines to move objects (e.g. lay-line gliding). Perhaps it is in some similar fashion.
---
Hope this was of some help.
---
Silverwastes has great replayability for me. 
---
I should probably have clarified it better. 
---
I meant that instead of stacking the one top DPS class for that encounter (like for example 4 Soulbeasts or something), most groups have a mix of different DPS classes (like 2 DH's, 1 Holo and 1 Weaver)
---
Wow a 30s split has higher damage than a 1:30 long benchmark. How surprising that your damage is much higher at the start when you're just getting your entire burst off. Split damage isn't what we're looking at, its the overall ending dps that matters. You can go to a golem and get insane 1st burst numbers, but that doesn't mean shit because its the ending sustained number that matters.
---
Eternal Battlegrounds. It has lootcastle, nuff said
---
I'd say Mount Maelstrom is better for plat.

SC's site is really not a handbook to getting by in pug raids and people need to stop treating their site and its data like it is or has ever been one.
---
There are some conclusions you can draw from what they release that will help you improve or point you in the right direction if you're looking to play better, but as a former raid trainer, I don't think there's anything more been anything more damaging to the scene than people who go 'But SC says...' and try to treat it as gospel, or like SC tactics work for every group.
---
SC assumes every player is competent, experienced, and knows what they're doing. I don't need to tell you that is rarely the case in a pug.
---
I'm not shitting on SC here - the work they've done is incredible and they continue to pay to provide these resources to raiders mostly out of pocket. I've used their information a hell of a lot over the years myself, relying on their guides and benchmarks. The data isn't the issue, it's the way the community uses it.
---
HoT is a big jump up in difficulty from the core maps. This is intentional, but can be jarring if you've failed to learn the basics of 'not dying'. That's not a jab at you - the core campaign is notoriously easy (you can literally afk a lot of the story missions) and therefore a less than optimal environment to learn the basics of staying alive.
---
As others have mentioned, get used to using dodge as required. It is your primary means of damage mitigation. Use them wisely, but do use them.
---
Don't stop moving. There are very few skills you need to channel whilst standing still.
---
Read the enemy descriptions below their names, and adapt accordingly. If it says 'stuns foes', bring a stunbreaker. If it says 'fires projectiles, blocks attacks' then bring a reflect. You get the gist.
---
Bring a 'get out of jail free' utility. Blink is great on mesmer. Necro has it's deathshroud. Rocket boots for engineer etc.
---
Don't aggro the pocket raptors.
---
I didn't even say that I topdps in our runs, hell I don't even play necro (Chronojail here)
---
But we often bring a support scourge in our raid runs since they make the entire experience a lot smoother. We're definitely not the best raiders and we don't pull top dps benchmarks and guess what? It doesn't matter since we still clear boss's in a timely manner anyway.
---
They are working on it ! Check their twitch where they were talking about it 5 days ago. They will trim the hitbox of WarClaw so you wouldnt be able to jump over walls and so on . It just takes time thats all .
---
Even if you could do more damage, you loose time through split phase, teleport, dodges and so on. The TOTAL damage per second you do is way lower.
---
Proof: snowcrows say Power dd is meta on sabetha. Power dd on golem is 32k dps, but they say that on sabetha the good dps for a Power dd is 22k dps. You Will never reach higher dps on bosses.
---
&gt; When you just put "war" in fractal lfg, you can expect that warrior won't come as condi or without banners.
---
You would be shocked, my guy. Doesn't happen in CM groups, but regular T4 is pure pot luck.
---
Hrm, overall it'd be **Verdant Brink** for me. It checks all the boxes:
---
* A non-trivial meta.
---
* A vast and expansive map full of little nooks and crannies to explore.
---
* It massively centers around a specific mechanic which it was meant to push, giving it a unique flair in comparison to other maps. And it does so really well.
---
* Cohesive visual design.
---
* Lots and lots (and lots!) of events.
---
Thats irrelevant here because 1. I said split phase damage before and 2. Not looking at split phases is worthless to compare the damage.
---
If you look at benchmark dps of deadeye rifle you will see its around 41-42k at 32 secs, in this log its 45k so my point still stands. You can do more damage
---
"6 years of the same content" - there are other games you know.
---
the screenshot you provided here makes your character looks like an edgy emo, but in the album it looks like super saiyan
---
That would be mine too. There's something to those lonely valleys, high peaks, vertiginous ledges and precarious bridges. Add that the Priory is beautifully integrated, and that there's *absolutely awesome* gliding to be had from those peaks.
---
Downvoted to hell? Cant read numbers on top of the first post I posted. You call me braindead yet you failed to read my original post which stated split phases specifically and then start arguing with total time. Way to go bud
---
Not even that wrong. 
---
Most people teleport from waypoint to waypoint. But in the books they described a device called 'a hole in the pocket'. which is essentially a waypoint call-back device. 
---
It must still be attuned  to each waypoint and its a complex piece of equipment
---
Not sure if you’ve leveled any sort of crafting but the utility that is best in slot can be made pretty cheaply with a few different trades.
---
The food is a bit more expensive but there are budget options. It’s also extremely cheap to master cooking and nice to have a sink for random materials.
---
Like others said, this commander was a little over the top. I wouldn’t worry too much about him, commanders have different demands and most of them would be fine with your set up.
---
That being said, you should still go for ascended armor. /weapons. The stat buff isn’t as important as getting the extra agony / resistance which will allow you to run the harder fractal levels for experience with more end game content. 
---
The cadablog quest is an easy way for you to get an ascended scepter. For the Greatsword &amp; Focus if your not interested in crafting them, the reward tracks during PvP season provide marks that will give you a stat selectable weapon of choice as well.
---
When your first starting out having an Armorsmith at level 500 is probably the best way to get your armor to ascended. 
---
Stick with DH. It’s meta for quite a few raid bosses where as FB, isn’t. The rotation is also easier, which is helpful while learning the mechanics. In addition to raids it’s also one of the best fractal classes.
---
Waypoints work through a network of minor Ley Lines (That's what Taimi discovered back in Silverwastes), so I suppose you're getting absorbed into the Ley Line network and transferred to the new Waypoints.
---
Actually if you join a guild that has Lost Precipe as a guild hall, you can just walk out of the zone into Verdant Brink.  The moment you step into the zone, it unlocks the Shipwreck Peak waypoint as well. I use that as a way to get many of my alts to HoT without doing story at all. 
---
Outside of some replayability issues (which admittedly are huge issues) these PoF maps are all gorgeous

I only changed it because I was going to sleep and didn't want to continue discussing, you would see that if you bothered to read.

If I may add, I don't think you are a pretty good judge of what is or what isn't interesting, considering that you think your first comment is both accurate and not discouraging OP to share their ideas.  
---
1. Regardless of how strong your PC is, pump your game settings up. Your audience can't see your framerate in a screenshot.
---
2. Mess with the camera controls, most times you will not want your character to be centered horizontally, but you do want to stay as centered as you can vertically most of the time. That part can be hard because the game likes to see over your head.
---
3. Make sure the UI is off (Ctrl-Shift-H)
---
4. Add the "-bmp" command line to your launcher so your game doesn't take crappy jpeg images. You'll have to go back and save them as .png images or jepgs with less compression using a program like Photoshop or GIMP.
---
5. Take multiple screenshots. Your characters' faces are very lifelike and if you take more than one shot you can pick the best expression of the bunch.
---
6. Pay close attention to the background and the lighting. Remember your entire screen will be captured in the image, and it will look nicer if you keep it that way and don't crop it. So if there is a giant pink norn, some sort of ugly low res texture, or even just lighting that clashes with your character, you may want to try a different angle or take a picture somewhere else.
---
7. Watch out for the shadows on your character. Sometimes they render in segments instead of one continuous shade and that can be very distracting. Try not to take a screenshot with that issue prominently in it unless you are confident in your ability to fix it with image editing software.
---
I love this map purely for the turtles. I wish we could get a mini version of the Sanswept turtles!
---
What is this sorcery and how does it work?
---
I had audio on I'm even more confused.
---
Sloth, MO, SH, Dhuum are where epi shines the most. Insanely beneficial.
---
South border of Riverlands, oh man, that place is just beatifull, all the water, structures, music
---
Can confirm... have beat KC whilst having blue, lvl10 armour but all my trinkets and weapons were full ascended.  The only reason I never noticed all fight is that I was healing :x
---
I like your settings, but I used tint colour of 10% to make light and sky look much bluer
---
You beat me(at) to it. 
---
GW2Radial will never work with it. Get over the radial menu and use hotkeys, or live with DX9 forever.
---
And the Lily of the Elon pass too, indeed.
---
ArenaNet never went in depth with this - or really, much of anything where magic and the Mists are involved. But from what we've seen:
---
* Waypoints are powered by ley lines and give off a certain frequency which is used to monitor the network.
---
* Not all waypoints in the game exist in the lore, otherwise things like the Verdant Brink meta event plots wouldn't make sense (because why don't everyone just WP out?).
---
* When NPCs use waypoints, they travel to underneath the waypoint, and iirc, the waypoint discovery animation (a beam shooting under it before a nova exploration from the waypoint) triggers as they disappear. Sometimes, the NPC can be found immediately after at another waypoint (such as Rytlock during Triple Trouble in S1 when he was investigating the energy probes causing the wurm issues).
---
* Waypoints can [detect hostile presence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tempest_Waypoint_Beacon) and deactivate (become contested) if said presence is too close.
---
* It is heavily implied, but not outright confirmed, that waypoints were based off of an invention of Snaff's, what he called "hole in my pocket", which was a ring that could expand to a full sized asura gate that could teleport people to places they've been.
---
Combine the above and you get that the lore method of using waypoints is to interact with it directly (I like to imagine that every waypoint has a device on the ground similar to the linked device at Cathedral of Zephyrs); when doing you're able to select to go to another waypoint you've been to before; when doing so, the waypoints "beam you up" and teleport you, no doubt similar portal function as the Guild Portal.
---
Yea you never said that, was more directed to other replies, and you can do whatever you want in your runs, as I will do whatever I want in mine. Support scourge is a meme, but if people want to run that go ahead, I won't.
---
Make your own group without req and waste 2 hours on 99cm.
---
I've always got trouble deciding between epi and spectral grasp at Sloth. I know epi cooldown is shorter, but Sloth cleanses itself every breakbar, and you can't epi whenever an ally is eating shrooms, so you're wasting the gain ...
---
It's kind of implied [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/That_Old_College_Try) that waypoints are based off of Snaff's "hole in the pocket" device.
---
The Silverwastes is the best map in the game. I've literally been farming it for years and it's still a good time.
---
Follow the link. It's all explained.
---
Raiding doesnt have to be cancer or elitist to get into! If you're in NA and would like to learn raids, please let me know! My guild teaches them and we are restructuring a bit to get as many trainings in we can a week! We welcome all classes as long as people are willing to learn how to play their class and role. 
---
well then its just the commander being dumb^^ Just try again, not all ppl in the raid community are toxic. actually there are quite a lot of veterans who rly have fun helping others getting into the raids. Also there are a lot of training guilds. Maybe you have more fun with them. And dont worry about your preparation. it sounds totally fine to me (even better then the one of most other ppl) GL :)
---
Really? Which one?
---
That gets you to Crystal Desert, not HoT and it's assuming you bought the deluxe version of Path of Fire.
---
&gt; Still I don't get why you would choose willingly to play a class wich is openly hated and looked down upon.
---
Probably because they aren't a slave to the hivemind and are capable of independent thought? Probably because they don't give a fuck about the fleeting and fickle approval of internet strangers who don't matter? Probably because they want to?
---
I still don't get why you would choose willingly to enslave yourself to what other people think when absolutely none of those people actually give a shit whether you live or die.
---
These are really good points but the data isn't great. It won't be until logs are provided for average DPS numbers, both on golems and on boss encounters. You are correct that the provided absolute numbers set expectations too high, but that isn't helped by those benchmarks often being grinded (ground?). 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Asura_Arena
---
Btw, after finishing the side story achievements you will get one of the bet head pieces (the red eyes)
---
Power Soulbeast and Power Warrior play surprisingly similar in PvE I think. Lots of parallels such as Peak Performance/Sic Em, Axe 5s, using CC as part of rotation etc.
---
I mean, you could, with a bit of math, get an average DPS for each boss because we know the enrage timer and the boss HP, and display the average DPS your group, and each player should get according to their role, in a normal group. If, by any chance, the numbers are relatively close for each boss, make a global average number. That could be a reference for everyone to see that you don't need max DPS to kill a boss.
---
Wait, what? The more shrooms you eat, the more slublings spawn? Is that true?
---
Speaking of Star Trek, built again with the same molecules
---
Wvw and Competiv XD
---
I kind of wonder more about why this is not something that is comunicated about in a good way and why it is not fixed or at least parts of it. There are many bugs and glitches around the Warclaw some easy (like why the hell can i not walk in and out of north Hills with the Warclaw when i can on any other keep/tower others without having to dismount) whilst other probably take a while but i mean come on, certainly you should stand ready as you do with every other release in game were bug fixes are pooring in for weeks, and we the WvW players for sure know about those because each time they are added WvW shuts down for a few min and we have to leave and reset. 
---
But for all those bugs concering WvW there is nothing yet. It have to be better planned then that. You have to add people to work on that as there is on other releases. So come on for once don't live the memes around this things regarding WvW and especially over something we never asked for in the first place. At least show some interest in what you place up on us.
---

I always pretend it's an early version of Dr. Manhatten :-)
---
I still don't understand why they don't just remove endurance in enemy territory.
---
use the silly scimitar? 
---
Im a Warclaw and I find this offensive.
---
Tangential, but assuming it's your left hand that's injured, perhaps consider getting a mouse with lots of buttons and transferring a lot of your rotation to your good hand?
---
In my current setup, I've got all weapon skills, heal, utility 9, elite, weapon swap, special action, and F1-4 all on my mouse and it's great.
---
Oh I'm aware, I just didn't word it in the best way. I replied the same on another comment but I'll reply the same here for clarification
---
I meant that instead of stacking the one top DPS class for that encounter (like for example 4 DH's or something), most groups have a mix of different DPS classes instead (like 2 DH's, 1 Holo and 1 Weaver)
---
I wanted him to have a bigger impact on the world but Anet was not i guess.
---
I love Timberline Falls. It's just gorgeous.
---
Waypoints are a type of asura gate created by Snaff and then further developed by Zojja. In order to travel between waypoints there must have been 1: a waypoint installed at the location you want to travel to. And 2: The device that allows you to travel to that location must be synchronized, meaning you have to get close to it first.
---
The waypoints around the world have already been placed there by an npc, and in some cases you can find npcs working on a waypoint to get it online, which is why sometimes a (broken) waypoint is contested. The device is expensive which is why not every npc uses them, but they do exist for anyone who has the device.
---
I wanted to focus mainly on what you need to focus on in eating the mushrooms. All thes infos you mentioned are included in every good guide, but an exact mushroom tactic seems scarce, since I still have so many people either eating wrong or asking me where TF do I go, that I decided to make a guide assuming people know the basic mechanics for the boss but want to work on their eating skills a bit.  
---
Thanks for the additional infos though!
---
Unpopular opinion - Dragon's Stand. I know it's not as rewarding as Auric Basin, but it sure is a fun map that makes me want to return to it. The coordination is not too hard like Triple Trouble, nor too easy like Silverwaste. It's a good balance of difficulty for open world meta. Also, it's the only map that we get to punch a dragon's mouth in the face.
---
This is what I've hear form several people. I've honestly not paid attention and counted, though maybe I need to.
---
They will not put a little patch every time something will break. They will wait for more of it to come and then update it all at once. Give them peace for once. They are working hard and hard rough times lately. 
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

Design and exploration has always been Draconis Mons. The first time I went into that map I fell in love with it. I like the concept of the 3 distinct layers and also enjoy the druid stuff that can be found around the map.
---
I'm sorry for the confusion. I was meaning that SC's golem "average" should actually be based on logs and the same with their reporter boss numbers to aim for. It shouldn't be a perfect or idealised since then it isn't actually a benchmark as the data is selective. 
---
Bare minimum for a power DH gear: appropriate weapons (scepter focus gs) with the sigils needed in each set (force &amp; slayer/impact), armor with runes in it (scholar preferred), trinkets. All exotic of berserker stat combinations. Food and Oil/Stone. Would suggest avocado smoothie or the sweet and spicy butternut squash one, and superior sharpening stones.
---
The fact you had ascended trinkets and weapons suggests more than bare minimum and I commend you! You CAN clear without using food, but it’s heavily disrespectful to others in your squad to do so as a dps. 
---
Get at least an exotic set (karma or tp), do HP runs in PoF and HoT maps (check LFG, they often do hp runs with basic masteries), read what your skills do and get a proper build ([metabattle.com](https://metabattle.com)). One thing i also do is get all waypoints in PoF and HoT maps for metas and bounties. 
---
If you move after spawning you can get to the block next to it. However slippery slope will slide you back off the block. Even if you have super speed you cant make it far enough to get on the block to stay.
---
&gt; There will always need to be a top and bottom of that balance list. 
---
Oh yeah something that makes a game mode nearly non functional can definitely be tossed into the "get to it whenever" pile.
---
This is reunning pretty stable in my rig.
---
Having "keep_pairs" set to 1 and "use_pso_precompile/use_pso_key_cache" set to 3 will eventually make my game not load . ( d912pxy/pck/pso_*.pck files )
---
Also it seems when keep_pairs is enabled it's easier for me to crash it , but unsure since I'v had either "game wont load" issues , but very rarelly do I get a crash. ( got 2 random crashes and moved back to keep_pair=0 )
---
The only way I can crash it, is to run msi afterburner and run anything as admin ( it will open UAC to ask if I want to run as admin ) that will crash gw2 , but only when using msi afterburner OSD "hooked" to gw2 ( expected , overlayception ? ) 
---
So for some people having issues , try to disable RTSS/Afterburner OSD.
---
* head into HoT/PoF and hit up 50 hero points for the 500 points you need to unlock both of your elite specs.
---
* grab mounts
---
* grab glider
---
* work out what playstyle you want, e.g. condi, power, support, etc and work on gear for it.
---
*whispers into the void*
---
Golem benchmarks are not indicative of raid performance
---
If they were, you'd run Rifle Deadeye on every power boss and Renegade / Firebrand on the condi bosses. That isn't the case. 
---
I still pop up in pre, 14 years later. 
---
Probably a combination of:
---
- getting a mount (or is that account-wide?)
---
- getting gliding (or is that account-wide?)
---
- get as many hero points as I can, likely from HoT/PoF maps first
---
- exploring the map to unlock waypoints
---
not necessarily in that order though
---
mostly yes, but with new char I would say - try your own build, use all weapons and get feel what you like. But that of course if OP dont want go full meta and do everything "end-game" with new char
---
Tangled depths. Hated as a newbie. Appreciated as a vet 
---
I think it's good that we have so many different answers in this thread, it means there's something for everyone! Mine would have to be Caledon Forest and Hoelbrak. Both are so perfectly emblematic of their native race and culture.
---
BLC
---
Queensdale for me. Beautiful and immersive. You can really feel the atmosphere of those common folks dealing with everyday problems like leaks or skritt stealing shit, at the same time you get to taste what the game will have to offer in the future. Troublesome centaurs are there and some sinister shit is going on in the swamp. Also the exploration is great, small things like the shortcut from that house into that bandit cave, the other secret bandit base or that hidden road connecting the moa farm to the souther part of the map. Really love that map, in general tho the first human maps are my favorite in the game 
---
Obviously not, but I'm not going to put "no nomads guardian" either - you have to draw the line somewhere.
---
I just meant I should have had to audio on to realize it was more than just an in game video capture.  I don’t actually understand what the audio adds.
---
I am not a player who shits on specific classes. I dont mind what players play in my raids, but your numbers are very low. If you want to make a case for a class you should at least post logs with very high numbers. Being top dps in a pug means literally nothing as their dps was utter dogshit
---
&gt; The data isn't the issue, it's the way the community uses it.
---
The data is part of the issue tho. SC's website has been really sloppy lately.
---
Their SH number for necro is 22k which is simply just wrong. It should be at least 26k
---
Matthias is marked as Inefficient for scourge.
---
Dhuum is marked as Unsubstantial, even tho scourge can get like 15k dps there.
---
etc.
---
A big dps increase thats not included in the scourge benchmark is that you get a lot of life force in fights that have adds.
---
I didnt said that I agree with that, but by ranging over it will change nothing. Especialy when will be rude to Anet here where devs can give you a ban. Be carful because when you will not have access, then you will not be able to change anything at all. 
---
What I do:
---
- Get Berserker gear.
---
- get a basic build together
---
- rush through HoT heropoints to get one elite spec
---
- check a build for that elite spec
---
- rush through as many PoF heropoints as I need for the other
---
- look for a build here, decide which one I prefere
---
- Do level 10 personal story if I haven't already this week, else wait for that
---
- do personal story up to level 60
---
- open BLCs with the keys from the story steps or don't, depending on if there is something I want in there
---
- see if there is builds that need special recipes/gear that is account bound rather than one of the easily available sets
---
- map complete?
---
**Important note though:**
---
I have over 50 characters, don't rush the expansions if you haven't played them yet.
---
It's pretty obvious that the warclaw received minimal development and testing, and was rushed out the door as fast as possible. It not being able to fit through those enclosed doorways on keep walls is a dead giveaway that anet spent very little time actually testing it before just dumping the mount into the live game.
---
The warclaw is never about WvW specifically, and is everything about additional monetization. The model, rig, and animation was likely designed for a PvE map, but was scrapped at some point, and proposed for WvW. Hell, the rig and most of the animations are from the griffon, so further proof that anet spent very little time on it.
---
The warclaw needs to be heavily redesigned for it to work well in WvW, and I'm not just talking about its obvious speed and CC immunity issues.
---
Things I do when making a new character (so many tomes/scrolls, so they're insta 80, and this is far from my first rodeo) 
---
* Gear up in exotic weapons + armor
---
* Gear up in ascended trinkets cos I've stockpiled mats
---
* Fashion wars for myself, then picking the right mount skin for that character and dyeing it in a matching theme. 
---
* Find / work out some appropriate open world build
---
* Open up World Boss locations
---
* Go get the breather from Gaveborn's Waypoint in Cursed Shore because I'm too cheap to buy the rare one off the TP :D
---
* Open up key gathering spots whether it's rich nodes, or just That One Place ^TM I like to go to for dailies
---
* Start working on an elite spec
---
* Open up key meta events in PoF + HoT, and bounty boards. 
---
* Mop up with any other key meta events / WPs I know I'm going to need. 
---
Only then do I feel like the character is in a playable state. Oh hey, that was exactly 10 things. Neato. 
---
People saying the HoT maps are like alien creatures to me. I hate them all and avoid them at all costs. They're more managable with mounts but calling any of them fun to play just blows my mind. They're mostly unbearable to me.
---
I don't think I have any favorite. I spend the most time in Queensdale, but I think I like the Sylvari maps more because they're so pretty.
---
The reality is vastly different. I command groups and pug enough to say that only 5% of the times I met someone who does 5-10% off optimal DPS. In real raids, I see DPS of an experienced - ish group varies from 60-75% of their class' s optimal benchmark, which makes all the DPS classes are fairly close to each other in terms of performance. However, certain classes will allow this type of mentality "I don't need to practice any rotations at all. Doesn't look too complicated. Just smash all the buttons to win." This is where problems arise. Out of all the noobs I taught in raid trainings, the necro "main" and the banner "main" (be it scourge or reaper) would consistently never improve individually weeks after weeks. Certainly they are never invited to my experienced raid clears.
---
Now on the pug side, I had people asking me if it's ok to bring a reaper, I usually give them a chance unless someone in my group already plays a reaper. It's not a great DPS to stack. As for scourge, usually no. Without epi bouncing, you'd better off doing shortens soul beast and skip the whole  c o m m u n i c a t i o n  altogether. 99% scourge in pugs are subpar. The scourges from my regular group are also beyond suboptimal that I already ban from playing.
---
[There you go.](https://i.imgur.com/OVwanAn.jpg)
---
Mounts/Gliding is accountwide.
---
Because instantaneous teleportation on a mass scale breaks suspension of disbelief to an absurd degree I just treat them as a game mechanic. 
---
Siren's Reef.
---
Don't @ me.
---
(I'm totally biased, I like the fast heart quests, the map is pretty, but more than all, I love the mastery there, I always wanted to play a bard like that with such badass cool effects)
---
Desert Highland because of Derelict Delve, that area was a BLAST to explore, and the little puzzle for getting the doors open was really fun. I wish more maps had areas like that, it really satisfied that thirst to explore a ruin.
---
What does any of this has to do with tag. I haven't done raids but is tag helpful? The first thing I did after getting 300g is buy a tag.
---
Deck out in exotic armour with as many ascended trinkets / weapons as you can cheaply get, grab mining tools and stuff, sort out some basic traits and skills, get hero points for the ones you're missing, do some meta events in the open world to get used to your build, grab some waypoints along the way, skin and dye your outfit/mounts, do some raids / living world maps / WvW / fractals / expansion collections / guild missions to get the rest of your gear ascended, meet a cute norn at the bar and ERP in Salma District. Job done.
---
In terms of the way they look - Crystal Oasis has to be the most beautiful zone in any game I have ever played. That is saying a lot considering my decades long love of certain Zelda, Metroid and Warcraft locations. Timberline Falls comes close though. Those lakes, mountains, green hills &lt;3
---
For replayability and achieving what they were designed for - Silverwastes. That map is just constantly enjoyable, and the music is fitting too.
---
For Nostalgia, Lornar's Pass and Queensdale. 
---
For music... Hmm. Almost every zone has music I love. But I have a soft spot for a lot of what plays in Lornar's pass. When I came back to the game before PoF released after a really long break I think that is where I first went to resume levelling and it's just so beautiful.
---
Chrono got rekt in the last balance patches 
---
Thanks? ':D
---
I dont think it matters what class your team plays when you one shot yourself on gorse retal :^ )
---
They were the mobs that made me *love* wells while I was on my mesmer!
---
Pshh, what do you mean? 45k is WAYYYY lower than DH! Look at my KC phase dps, 150k+ dps! Trash class trash damage! Delete Thief! Deadclass.
---
Well... you're not wrong...
---
Warclaw can’t fit through doors, but the golems that appear much bigger have no problem. Hmmm. 
---
Agree on that point!
---
*Go to wvw and get all the hero point througth currency.
---
*Unlook all Elitespecs.
---
*Equip char fully ascendent.
---
*Go to the golem area and learn my rotation if needed.
---
Roaming =/= taking camps and sentries. That’s a side goal to keep participation up. You kill solos in a 1v1 and that isn’t a gank no matter how much you try to believe it is. I’ll even go 1v2 these zerglings with a zerg build as well and still win. Won’t make me a ganker by your logic will it?
---
Yes that's the one. Lol so creepy.
---
COME ON SOUTH
---
Do you have a log by any chance? I want to see this rotation
---
thats why you should do fast cc no updraft ;)
---
Being able to make those benchmarks requires understanding of the class and its rotations. Being on snow crows also probably means you're decent at raids. So, a necro main from snow crows making the benchmarks probably has a better idea than some random on Reddit, but sure, pretend that the two things are unrelated 
---
[power D/D De droped to 34k dps](https://youtu.be/jj6fmKoXfkQ). There were some big nerfs last patch. Some benchmarks are out already but you have to check on YouTube. In general all benchmarks went down 
---
Monster Hunter World
---
As long as a scepter is stick-like in appearance and can be pointed with one hand, I would argue that no matter how ridiculous or absurd it looked, it still wouldn't be impractical.
---
https://dps.report/GUfA-20190318-225229_dei
---
Note that the weaver didnt have 25 might for the first 12 sec so his dps was low. The other 2 dghs have been having some rotational issues for the past few weeks. I didnt mean it as in like your damage sucks. You might be a good/great player, but if you want to compare you should compare the same level of players where reaper falls off.
---
My favourite map is Fields of Ruin. Ebonhawke, all the charr/human tension, the beauty of the map... I just love it. 
---
As for best map? I honestly have no idea. Each one offers different things for different people. 
---
Thank you for the help, but I'm from EU. :(
---
Just make the keys lootrate a bit higher, and make the keys sellable on TP. Fixed.
---
Those maps are 15 years old :)
---
Man I need to do fractals... 
---
Many mastery achievements such as 4 lines of bosses on Verdant Brink can not be finished by merely 4-5, I have been doing these for a month. It very glitched...
---
Sometimes, group events will block the map exploring, undoable by one(or 3+) and no one help even I backed to Arah to lfh,use LFG and etc
---
Some of the devs want them (the recent 2v2 event), but anet just doesn't care / doesn't want to commit resources. 
---
That's true. Many of the melee weapons (like axes, swords and greatswords) look very impractical, but I guess that can't really be said for the magical weapons (scepters, staves and the like). Although in this particular case, that poor wyvern would have a tremendous headache from being swung all the time... 
---
Props to linking 2 times to [reddit.com](https://reddit.com) I think it's really important, lest we forget which site we're on.
---
I recommend finding like-minded people so head over to /r/Bless and shit on the game for free karma.
---
If the apes arent getting kicked then yes
---
I have Unbound Magic ones. Every 100k Unbound Magic is around 12-18 clovers for free, and you earn around 50 gold.
---
I only do it this way because i craft legendaries all the time. Otherwise getting the harvesting axe that rewards more wood would be better, like you said.
---
That doesnt mater.. I have bad memory for names and dates =/. I feel bad now =( 
---
I wont change it. I put all my money in those little thrills. I wanna keep the as they are.
---
Yeah you should. They are not that hard as others belive ;) 
---
and MHW = monster hunter: world
---
It provide a auto-group system on log-in, and a very good 'help' system
---
You cant compare full deimos runs tho there are too much variables like wrong blacks wrong tanking positions, slow,ccs during the saul phases, people going down  in the opening burst the only one who was higher was one dh just compare the first 25% the reaper doesnt fall off compared to the log you listed and tbf it shouldnt the last bench was on 31k afaik and btth weaver and guard arent much higher if you compare that reaper gets a huge boost under 50%
---
I know some people who don't like having to change their build so they just have each specialization fully geared as a separate character. I suppose that's one way to get over 10
---
I wouldn't change anything because I assume they give Anet a lot of money.
---
&gt; group events will block the map exploring
---
Wich one ? You can get all of them easily. 1 in Auric isnt possible without doing event. And 3 in Dragon Stand. But others you can get easily. 
---
That would be the equivalent of Anet saying "Hey, how about me make no money at all?"
---
&gt;be rude to Anet here where devs can give you a ban.
---
Anet cannot ban anyone in this subreddit, since they do not control anything here. Anet employees have no specific privileges and protections here in this subreddit, other than the special Arenanet flair.
---
Also, making a fuss here is one of the most effective ways of getting anet to listen. Their own forums are moderated to death, Facebook/Twitter aren't effective in communicating to the devs directly. Which leaves this subreddit.
---
I also really like Caledon Forest. But for me, it's because it has 4 jumping puzzles and even a hidden and incomplete 5th jumping puzzle/dungeon.
---
&gt;and was hitting 37k dps on the golem. While bringing banners.
---
how to spot complete bullshit.
---
4 items per chest. 3 random, lesser items--transmog charges, more keys, etc. 1 set, rotating items, you cant get duplicates until you get the whole collection. Small chance that goes up by a bit if you get all the set items to get super rare contracts instead of a set item. 
---
Ah, a true raider at heart &lt;3
---
More like because 90% of necro players are absolut trashcans that need necro wheelchair mechanics to barely function
---
One character and no build templates. No thanks.
---
Then just make the key sellable and do not adjust dropping rate 
---
I certainly would prefer if tengu had brand new voice acting, but there would be such a huge amount of dialogue to re-record. Personally, I'd rather have a new race with a "pitch-modulated" version of an existing voice actor than no new race at all, but I understand that people differ in their opinions on this!
---
Well first of all yes I was banned after I said something rude here. Coincidence ? Maybe. They didnt told me much anyway. But Im use to it by now so its fine. And other thing is.. why you cant let me scare these kids ? They would try to be polite for some time at least . Now you ruined it all =/. 
---
Im getting banned every few months lately. I just feer that it might be a system error or its now .. a tradition. =/ 
---
Would be kind of interesting in that it would probably force some scout-ahead play if a group wants to all run on mounts.  Won’t really affect comms who aren’t mounting anyway for the benefit of players without warclaw/PoF
---
I'm more playing devil's advocate here than anything.  With skins and unlocks often being tied to achievement points and over all in game tracked collections the "power" of an item isn't as much of an issue because a lot of "prestige" is earned through cosmetic unlocks. 
---
Imaging having to strawman this hard because you don't have an argument outside of "let pugs play whatever they want because they're not going to be perfect anyway."
---
If you forgot what the original argument was, I'll quote it for you:
---
&gt; It probably won't make you feel any better, but people have been wrong  about necro for years. It used to be the fractals squads that refused to  accept the fact that necro DPS is great (and always has been), now it's  raid squads. 
---
This person is suggesting that snow crows and everyone else (except for himself) has the wrong idea about necros and that necros are great.
---
I think you just proposed that the Tengu steal Claw Island from LA. 
---
I think TERA had a good approach; multiple lock boxes with multiple themes.
---
They had to do a rework after some criticism (from what I've read), and ended up with what sort of looks like the "special" inclusions the BLTC boxes have now, but the boxes are *always* available, and you can pick which ones you open.
---
I think a lot of people like the Skinner Box thrill, even being aware of its down sides, but a narrower range of potential rewards with better choice is completely possible and I think would be a big addition.
---
Purchasing hero points from the Heroics Notary in WvW and using them to unlock Elite spec. makes a big difference - especially buying the HoT hero points, which are difficult to earn on your own with a character that you don't know how to play yet.
---
&gt; New Playable Race: Tengu
---
Well, not a "mini-expansion" anymore, at least not from the developers point of view.
---
A new race without access to every already existing armour skins would only feel halfassed and create more bad emotions in the community than the opposite.
---
Without new race, I would like this.
---
No, those benchmarks mean being able to press buttons in the correct order at the correct time. They have no bearing on either understanding a profession or its rotations - that is what actual raids test since mechanics will interrupt the latter and the former is tested when things don't go to plan.
---
I'm quite surprised you didn't get my point regarding the DPS options I mentioned - neither of them are, in practice, used frequently on bosses because they are outclassed in actual raiding scenarios (Rifle DE by professions that can cleave and burst better while being able to move, condi options by Mirage or Holosmith due to Confusion). Benchmarks and golems don't correspond to raids (and certainly not to pugs!). 
---
I use F1-4 and then F5 I rebound to Shift-Q. I'm used to using those keys as camera locations from Starcraft II though.
---
Personally, I think it's easier to think of a set # of keys as the usage rather than specific skill. I generally put the skill I use least on T. Heal Skill on Q, E for 1st priority utility, R for 2nd priority, etc. OR move it around to make it fit a combo easier.
---
For DH rotation, I remember it as the Justice Sandwhich, where I just hit reF1r near the end of Scepter 2 rotation.
---
The devil's advocate will have much trouble to justify this slippery slope. My birth is random, ban my parents, those filthy genetic lootboxes.
---
Which is why we ultimately don't respect this kind of law and bypass it (VPN).
---
To make the rotations in the first place, you have to have an understanding of the class. Don't come here trying to tell me that pugs who somewhat randomly press their buttons have a better understanding than people who have the highest DPS for the class. 
---
I did talk about the class I'm familiar with, not sure how you entirely missed out on that one. 
---
Still, it seems you're suggesting that necro pugs are more of an authority on how to raid as necros than Snow Crows members who play necro and make the benchmarks.
---
Interesting approach a mix of old schools MMOS mechanics with modern aplications.  
---
But this post should be more at  [/r/MMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMO) than here. 
---
I’m imagining a knockdown of 2 seconds. People wouldn’t be able to storm into camps so easily. Camps would be more fun to defend.
---
What? O_o
---
Because they're dope?
---
Your perfect MMO sounds like a full time job rather than a method of entertainment. Will I get paid to play it?
---
One can dream...
---
Perhaps try acting more like a civilized human then.
---
the pvp lobby
---
floating islands, hidden llamas and cats, trees, a waterfall,  a few golems for your pve fix , all kind of pieceofsht players for social interaction , the only npc you ll ever need: the banker so u can spend 3-5h looking for a mog that looks good without a cape
---
The dialogues be like:
---
"Mother, what do we do now?"
---
"We wait for the commander and the pact to end this fight."
---
"You think they will make it?"
---
"Lol no we're fucked, sweetie." 
---
It would be easier to pick maps I don't love and in that category would probably win Thunderhead Peaks. Somehow I don't like combined snow and branded theme and ofc story really hurt the feelings
---
Definitely not! Members of the tengu houses, united under the emperor in the Dominion of Winds, rarely leave the walls of their city. Yet of course a few tengu must leave to fish and trade with the merchants of Lion's Arch. There would only be a few tengu fishermen and traders in the Merchant's Seaboard map, as well as an old tengu monastery up north, but LA activity would still be the dominant force there.
---
Ooh! Very exciting. Thank you. 
---
What does your gear look like? Yes, active defenses are important, but if you're running around in greens, you're going to have a bad time. Try to get full exotic armor, trinkets, and weapons if you don't have that already. 
---
Im not the one been rude to others. 
---
a anti-mount trap is fine but insta dismount is a bit much.
---
Did you even read his post? He was kicked for this "bad" gear when it was perfectly suitable.
---
Snow Crows apart from maybe that short window where reaper was "fixed" and actually became worse has never said that Reapers were unplayable or anything. The clear speed DPS times they post aren't realistic for most groups and aren't required to actually clear the encounter. They have the disclaimer for a reason lol.
---
This law, and the climate around, does not revolve around protecting children. It's always about some kind of twisted morale "random is bad, equal chance for everyone". Plus the fact it's not taxed.
---
Battlefront II wouldn't have been such a disaster if players had just boycotted the game. Don't like, don't consume.
---
This "slipery slope" means we'll ultimately ban everything, everywhere, everytime, because it's not fair, and someone might abuse it. Preventing normal people to enjoy it. Even lootbox gambling. Of course, the reference to parents was sarcastic.
---
I was almost expecting "how to pay the electricity bills after 2 years of being afk":-D
---
Dry Top is incredible for me, it has everything. The Desert bio-me is incredible and the dynamic variables it has on offer due to the hostile Sandstorm is incredible design. The oasis biome and zephyrite wreckages add really nicely to the map also. It's my absolute favourite in Tyria for spending down time due to the ambience on offer. Not to mention how nice the story is also within Dry Top and the significance it had in early living world.
---
Also in my personal top maps would be: Auric Basin, Fields of Ruin and Brisban Wildlands.
---
Doesn't matter, you unlock every core skill and trait at lvl 80 guaranteed, so just experiment and try out your arsenal.
---
It's very well done. I'm very glad he's doing this. It'll be great to watch this again in 30 years to remember my time with the game.
---
Do we know if he'll be doing Living World Season 2-4, Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire? Possibly waiting for an unlikely Season 1 re-release first?
---
Anyone in [Delusional Elitists](https://www.twitch.tv/team/delusionalelitists).
---
It doesn’t really matter at this point. By the time you hit 80 you have enough for everything but the elite specs. Just try out w/e ones you want. Killing stuff with any or no skills at this point is easy enough.
---
Sure, sylvari would work for me too. And definitely, you'd have to get the voice actor in the studio to record a few new tengu-specific [player chatter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Voice-over#Player_Chatter), but that's a relatively small task, and you wouldn't need to hire anyone new.
---
Its not a glitch. On the bottom left side of the world map there are layers. Thunderhead has a few layers on it and sometimes its on the wrong layer which could make the waypoint really hard to spot.
---
Nice to see there's ideas like this still around.
---
The new zones should be free to access, designed for new players, who should be directed here instead of the classic zones for a more modern experience. The city itself could be designed with multiple activities in mind, just so it isn't useless like the other capital cities. A hub for fishers could work well, letting players train in fish farms or something.
---
By the way, [here's a direct link to the map for my version](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/8/80/User_Lon-ami_Day_of_the_Tengu_map.jpg), in case anyone is interested. It's pretty much the same, with an additional zone to the south. Here's two other versions for [largos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/6/6a/User_Lon-ami_Mark_of_the_Largos_map.jpg) and [barathrum (stone dwarves)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/91/User_Lon-ami_Memories_of_the_Barathrum_map.jpg), using the same "race pack" DLC model, but no capital cities of their own (the new zones would have Ebonhawke-like hubs instead).
---
Also, post a link to that artwork, it's awesome lol.
---
Most recent long stories have check points and they work ok. They could use more of them and be more explicit about it tho
---
They already have dismount traps on their list
---
GW2 survived with its mediocrity because there is no alternative. It's both good and bad for us. Good, because we can play. Bad, because Anet feels no pressure to improve and it's clear they do not even try.
---
-gear up in either exotics or ascended, based on the sc build guide for dps (but probably having to swap the elite spec trait line for the time being)
---
-I would go get hero points and unlock the elite specs
---
-practice the rotation a bit to at least have a general understanding
---
-Do personal story up to level 10 for the black lion key
---
-Do living story 2 episode: tangled paths for the black lion key
---
-run them to each dungeon on the core map (using a mount, literally just keep moving its very fast)
---
-take the aerodrome to salvation pass, then exit through portal to get to verdant brink.  Run backwards to siverwastes to unlock that zone.  Then progress forward to get to dragon stand
---
-use my season 3 and 4 books to unlock all the zones from those seasons
---
-go to south sun to unlock that zone
---
-go to my guild's guild hall in crystal desert, exit, way point to the starting way point of that map, exit the map, way point to the starting way point, etc, until I unlocked all the pof maps.  
---
Still fail to see your point. There's nothing in that area.
---
Sadly no.
---
If I was a billionaire, I would definitely invest significant amounts of CASH into making the ultimate MMO experience. I would also, pay 6 figure salaries to seasoned veteran MMO players to take part in its development. Perhaps I'd pay you then :)
---
It would be really cool to have to do an epic quest to prove yourself worthy of being the first outsider to enter in 200 years.
---
You can convert gems to gold.
---
Yes.
---
It wasn't a layers issue, because I tried to view it through every layer and the map was still grayed out with no waypoints present
---
&gt;1- Open world with no loading screens (except for challenging group content)
---
Fair complaint
---
&gt;2- No Cashshop
---
&gt;3- Subscription model
---
No, that's dumb.
---
&gt;4- All gear to be obtained through crafting ALONE. Dungeon and Raid bosses to drop unique components for their recipes.
---
Somewhat fair complaint, but you're probably interested in something like RuneScape instead.
---
&gt;5- Rigorous Crafting disciplines. There should be at least 20 of them and be extremely difficult and time consuming to fully be proficient in one, with no cap on how many you can learn.
---
You'd probably be interested in Black Desert Online, in which skills take as long to train as they would if you just went and learned them in real life. 
---
&gt;6- No vertical progression at all, a character starts with horizontal progression from day One.
---
&gt;7- No classes, a character can switch in a major way combat gameplay through gear switching and horizontal progression.
---
Makes sense in RuneScape, makes less sense in games like Guild Wars 2 and MapleStory.
---
&gt;8- No twinks - 1 character per account.
---
This is a ridiculous idea. I spend 92% of my gameplay on one character, but "one character per account" is still extremely anticonsumer. This is precisely why I never created an Ironman in RuneScape. You'd have to pay multiple subscription fees.
---
&gt;9- No achievements
---
This is incredibly stupid.
---
&gt;10- No Daily quests/achievements/activities/login rewards
---
Also no. Like "no achievements", modern games need these in order to stay competitive and keep people coming back to the game.
---
&gt;11- Secret dungeon and raid entrances (to be discovered by the community through quests and item interactions and not told via symbols on maps, and speaking of maps...)
---
Exists in Guild Wars 2 already.
---
&gt;12 - No map UI (including world map and minimap) - maps to be obtained through a cartograph (crafting discipline based on exploration and paper + ink utilisations) Players can mark/draw on their own maps
---
Really, really, really bad idea. 
---
&gt;13 - A quest log for up to three quests (Starts with 1, and can be pushed up to 3 via horizontal progression)
---
What's a quest? Why not just let people have unlimited quests in their log? RuneScape and MapleStory do quests the best.
---
&gt;14 - Dynamic Events existing in conjunction with available quests to be taken from NPCs. However, not every quest is beneficial to do depending on certain factors, and clearing some might work against you. Players should be examining the quest text + rewards + consequences before accepting and clearing quests. Some players will benefit from a given quest while others might not on the very same quest.
---
Sort of exists in Gw2 but not really because there are no quests.
---
I never really got into raiding because I could get find a group, but the few times I went in, people were bitching that I brought my necro. I remember several times I would look around and notice that I was the only one still alive.
---
Totally in favor. Actually in favor of literally anything non-conquest getting a PvP queue! 
---
what time would that be? hope i can hop in  
---
The complexity and challenge of the maps is why they get so much praise. Once you know your way around they're fun to navigate, but they have enough complexity that you have to relearn some parts if you go away for a while. The three map metas are really fun, and require skill that all players can learn, but still have some challenge.
---
  
---
I love and hate tangled depths because of these aspects.
---
Yes please. 
---
I don't see why a new race would need to have access to previous living worlds, personal story, expansions etc.. Most people who would buy this mini-expansion would have played through that already.
---
Just make mounts vulnerable to hard cc pls...
---
Mounts are just ridiculous while you roame and trying to block people going into towers keeps etc. 
---
Yes he is! All the explorable dungeons first and then into Season 2 onward :)
---
I like the idea, but it wouldn't be a mini expansion at all. 
---
A new playable race means to create over **50** armor sets (x3 because we have 3 armor types), dozens single armor pieces and over **70** outfits *only* to give Tengu the armors we already have ingame.
---
For comparsion, with HoT we got 6 armor sets (plus one only heavy). With PoF we got 5 armor sets. 
---
And that's only the armor skins, think of all the voice acting (the whole story for male and female voice), animations, dialogs and stuff.
---
That's why new races aren't a thing and probalby will never be. The work it needs, only to reach status quo, is insane.
---
Plese due tell. 
---
Please make a new account.. don't get any of your friends involved. and let me know when you reach wing 6 even if you know everything about encounters..
---
Even in that scenario it will take some time.
---
And this while you will be the group leader so you won't be checked for LI every time. 
---
If you don't know the encounters it will take to long to get access to all encounters and with a dwindling raid population... things will just go down.
---
If you want "fresh meat" you need a proper difficulty setup.
---
Your "batch" of wvw players is just a small sample size that doesn't say much.
---
I can get my friends in game, help them gear up and we will be doing all the raids in no time since they have a neck for it. That doesn't prove anything.
---
Here the problem is about new player absorption into raiding and currently not individual player skill is killing most new groups.. is the requirement on group coordination for some of them. 
---
Personally I don't find them hard especially after I have run them so many times.. but the perspective for a new player is not the same.
---
I can now login and the screen is no longer blank. 
---
BUT the  2-Factor Authentication keeps failing even after several tries now.
---
A really bad idea as there is no counterplay. Mounts finally gave poor pugs a chance to run away from asshole ganker thief (que in whining how "I just want to kill unsuspecting low level players and make their lives miserable because it's a valid strategy!!!!1111") and your suggestion will bring it back to the hell they were in for quite a while. 
---
No, we don't need it. Certainly not AOE and certainly not "prevent mounting". Not unless it only lasts for, say, 5 minutes, applies _really_ non removable reveal for same 5 minutes in AOE around 2000 units near it. As in sure, you can place this trap. But fuck no, you can't wait in stealth to kill off player later.
---
The whole thing, on my book
---
/r/GW2Exchange 
---
Yea after shattered observatory its kinda been all downhill for fractals.
---
There was a idea/rumor that floated around when it was announced that S4 would go directly into S5 that S5 would essentially be an expac that played out over the course of a year, and I really loved that idea.  A new elite spec with each patch, a meaty map each release, and a few new core features released over the course of the season (not just a new mount).  OP's post is exactly the sort of "mini expansion" I dreamed about when that idea was floating around.
---
You sir get it
---
The current market facilitates the continuation of GW2. A major shift in it, can and will threaten this game. 
---
TBH, the idea is giving me DCUO flashbacks; maps (or worse, *parts* of maps) that were unusable unless you bought (all) the current DLC. 
---
That's true. One possible way to reduce the amount of voice-acting needed is to make the personal story inaccessible to characters of the new race, explaining it by saying that the Dominion of Winds has only recently been opened so a Tengu couldn't have gone through all those story parts that take place before the death of Zhaitan. 
---
Similarly, a Largos could perhaps use modified voice tracks of either humans or Sylvari. I think.
---
&gt; Please do not
---
&gt; Exchange items (Sell/Buy/Donations).
---
Having a race be half-baked and share voice acting would immediately be a no sale for me. I dislike the community's constant proposal of compromising the quality of a new race in order to rush them out quicker or save on money. 
---
In guild wars or another universe this would be possible. Not in gw2. Sadly. 
---
I've always supported the idea of mini xpacs/dlcs. Instead of a massive map with story, elite specs, mee mechanics and shit, we just get 3-4 normal sized maps, some new skills for the existing professions, maybe even new weapons, a few new IN GAME armors and weapons and some side story quests. Would be waaaay better than the living story garbage and I'm sure people would be willing to pay for such content 
---
Caledon Forest. 4 jumping puzzles (5 with the unfinished out of bounds puzzle), 2 mini dungeons, incredibly diverse biomes. Not surprising though, since it was originally designed for 2 races, until the Tengu were cut (as per the GW2 artbook excerpts).
---
Auric Basin would be a close 2nd for me.
---
Why not include Ember Bay? The route there is small, but very fast with griffon/raptor, and nets more wood than ML in comparable time.
---
Couldn't say no, to this hairstyle...  
---
My guardian, totally wanted him to be a Charr, bigger than anyone else and with "back banner" so typical yet so cool imo xD  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/BgQywvI](https://imgur.com/a/BgQywvI)
---
Fingers crossed for bl-keys or foefire armor skins
---
bit too hard imo
---
id like to see two changes to warclaw
---
1. less health (halved even), players dont even have to think about dismounting to prevent being thrown off (and when they are thrown off theyve already absorbed most of the burst and mobility)
---
2. susceptible to soft CC; chilling fog&lt;cat, AC cripple? not a factor... making them affected by hard CC would be a bit much; but make them slower when chilled/crippled would be less obnoxious
---
Storage expander please!
---
they are by far the most time intensive and annoying part of the entire process. there is a good reason why people usually talk about the trading of gifts of exploration, instead of gifts of battle, clovers, or - the most accurate - gifts of mastery.
---
Ive seem more shit players ping legendary armor then almost anything else. Li and leggy armor have no merit to me. If they are trash, then they’re trash, and no number of legendaries will change that 😁
---
Think you missed that one https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/az5cfv/todays_sale_bank_tab_expansions_are_20_off_for_24/
---
Sure! I'll try to get it asap
---
Thanks for checking!
---
if you like fashion wars, these are some of the best purchases you can make from the store
---
The problem with skipping the Personal Story, is that all the later plot and dialogs assume that you are the Pact Commander, and there are occasional references to your defeat of Zhaitan.
---
What’s the fastest and/or most efficient ways to get BL statuettes?
---
Thanks!
---
A trap is too passive with nocounter play. Players will drop traps then wait in towers while pugs unknowingly stumble across them. Not very fun for either.  
---
The mount right is too safe, there is no reason to engage if both players are mounted. We need a way to dismount players other than a stationary ballista. I'd rather they either replace the stomp on engage with a dismount, or more likely, let is train a fourth move that let's us hurl a spear at mounted foes. This would allow counter play for mounts, good players can still avoid being dismounted quickly while returning some risk to forces that try and travel without a group, and allowing players to once again try and stop reinforcements to large battles. 
---
and verdant brink has scout acan, so its an instant win in music :)
---
on first glance it looks like you disabled the fog that exists precisely to cover that stuff up
---
&gt; Always run epi. How else are you going to kill the mushroom guy? /s
---
I was that mushroom guy yesterday ... blessed by an epi at 4th shroom. Appreciated.
---
&gt; tho im sure youd never use grasp during mushroom eating phase
---
Yeah, that's why I don't see epi short CD as an asset, because of the limited timeframe. Plus spectral grasp generates life force.
---
You do the same thing at 80 that you would at low levels. Thats the beauty of the game. Yes there's ALOT to do. I would say go in order. Play all the living world stories up to the first expansion. Then buy HoT. Work on all your masteries. Get gliding and such. Game is not play to win, it's pay to glam. The gems are used for armor, Weapon, glider, ect... skins, pets, toys, ect... 
---
Just to damn kinky in a weird fucking way 🤣
---
* Start Path of Fire. The first quest will get you a Raptor mount. You can get two additional mounts just by exploring specific maps, completing Renown Hearts, and paying trade contracts and a small gold fee. There's two additional ones as well, but they're more expensive and require more prerequisites.
---
* Start Heart of Thorns. The first two quests will guide you into unlocking Gliding. (Optional: Keep playing until the end of "Roots of Terror" for a free Black Lion Chest Key) You can refine your gliding skill with more mastery points (Same with boosting your mounts).
---
* If you haven't done your weekly keyfarm yet, start your Personal Story, and complete the level 10 quest for a free key. You can go further up until the Level 60 quest "The Battle of Claw Island" for two more. Personal Story quests are good for learning your class, at least up until the final one. Then the gloves come off.
---
* Use LFG to search for Hero Point Trains. Use these to unlock your elite specs.
---
* Optional step-Pick up Living World Season 2 Episode 6 for another Black Lion Chest Key, and Living World Season 4 Episode 3 for an additional mount.
---
* Once you've learned how your class works, etc, you could possibly consider picking up a 'meta' build. That will require new gear, but to make it easier, start with the exotic version of gear with those stats, and as you gather ascended equipment, slowly swap it out.
---
* If you're into World Vs World, you can pick up the Warclaw as well. Though be careful, it's still on the buggy side.
---
This is a very good point, i will search for an option in gw2 hook.
---
Ye, all I want is 360° panorama screenshots with Ansel. Let's hope we get full support for Ansel some day.
---
VG is a tank and spank boss for experienced players. For new players it is not.
---
I have ran multiple training runs on VG, Deimos and w6 and you won't believe how small is the kill rate on them.
---
Mind you, they were run by me and a friend,so 2 veterans..
---
We explained.. we sent videos.. used discord.. and ppl still messed up because they are not used to keeping track of mechanics and their own rotations.
---
Furthermore if you want new players you can't have them all have alts for raids. You need to be able to do them with a mix and match. There are many raid encounters that are trivial with the optimized setup.. but that is not the point. The point was to get more ppl interested in raiding.
---
The raiding scene is dieing because ppl are not interested.. I have many casual friends that see SC and DnT as "hardcore" pricks or they don't give a damn about them. There is an elitist athmosphere when it comes to raids and that has pushed ppl away from it. To that you add all the li requirements that stops most solo players and with the given difficulty and you end up to the current state: dedicated raiders are bored and leaving the raiding scene and there are not enough new players coming in to take the place. Even small guilds fail to much to make static groups since they will always be 7 or 11 or 13 or any other number but 10 so it is harder for them to organize internal raids. With pugs is a hit or miss. some leave in 1-2 min if the group struggles a bit others become toxic and thankfully others are helpful. Anyway sorry for the small rant.
---
As someone said ( obviously the internet :)) ), you can't balance a game against the best player nor can you do it against the worst..  You can make the lowest difficulty so hard that the hard core raiders can do it only when in perfect sync as you can't make them so that even with no gear or barley any game knowledge you can do them.. there needs to be a middle ground. The problem with the middle ground is that you will have what we have: hardcore players don't want to do it because it is to easy  and it is still to hard for the majority :)))
---
A difficulty tier system adjust this by offering almost impossible to be done difficulty for hardcore players that optimize to the extreme ( SC, DnT, LN, etc) while allowing casuals to see the bosses, kill them and maybe want more.. maybe they try to do harder difficulties.. if not at least they play what they can. This will mean more ppl play the game mode and Anet has a bigger reason to improve on it.
---
This is the reason why you have difficulty scaling in most single player games. I usually play normal-hard mode.. my wife players easy as she just wants to see the story.
---
So. in my opinion with a player base comprised of almost 80% + of casuals you need even more a tier system for raids if you want to get them into raids.
---
And a good example of this working is the tier system you have for fractals.. there are plenty of players doing them and not all do them do T4.. heck even I don't always run T4 when I just want to chill as I still can encounter bad players that make a mess out of it.
---
Storage Expander and Bank Tab Expansion are two different things.
---
Those are Bank Tabs, Storage Expanders had no discount yet iirc.
---
&gt; I also noticed that the highest purchase includes crystals, what are these ? Please don't tell me that this game has become a pay to win mmo :-/
---
Those are regular gems, and there has always been a real money store. But gold can be exchanged to gems and vice versa. Nothing p2w there.
---
Other than that, there are hundreds of threads like these. Use the search function and you'll find what you need. Just play the game for now. Create a new char and take it slow. Addons only matter at 80.
---
It is difficult to give good feedback on this issue when people can't agree even on if a specific bug with the mount is an exploit.  Some people have been getting really nasty in saying that it is being done on purpose, when in my experience no one is purposely exploiting.  I've seen VODs where one side shows the animations bug and the other does not.  How do you accuse people of doing something on purpose that which they cannot even see?
---
I am aware of what anet is saying, but I disagree with players repeating their words like it's a cemented fact. Being passive doesn't improve the situation, it only makes it worse. Atm we still have a few pro pvp streamers, a small competitive(ish) community and 1 passionate pvp dev (probably the only one), but when that's gone, pvp is done for. 
---
I do wonder what happened to a company rooted in competitive background and with a vision for better mmos. 
---
And in this particular case, it’s recommened that you don’t. Dragonhunter longbow is hot garbage. 
---
I'm not sure waypoint use is ever consistent in the fiction.
---
The fact that the game will route you through gates to get to a personal story instance has always made me wonder if they were a late addition to the game, the the game was originally just going to have gates at all of the major settlements - a bit like how GW1 worked, where you could teleport only to the town instances.
---
The characters seem to know and not-know about the waypoints in equal measure. They *are* mentioned, but not consistently. Meanwhile you've got Lion's Arch NPCs talking about how they love having the gates in the city, which would be a strange thing for them to say if they were aware of waypoints.
---
Ultimately they're a game feature and I don't personally *need* them to fit into the fiction, but I am curious as to how it came about, from a development perspective.
---
Are you sure;)
---
the playerbase are hardly to blame for asking for less skins in the store and more earnable through playing, anet are at fault for taking that as "they want armours so just give them more outfits". it would be much better if they had more expansions that you have to pay for but they include a lot of gemstore quality armour sets that you can earn in game, not through the gemstore. that way they'd be getting their money and people would be having more fun and actually feel like they earned their skins
---
This sounds amazing. I'd absolutely buy a tengu race pack and some char slots, and I'd also love to have to go through some worthiness trials on an existing PC to get in and explore!
---
"still" working on it haHAA
---
&gt;do HP runs in PoF and HoT maps (check LFG, they often do hp runs with basic masteries),
---
Excellent idea.  Would never have thought to look in LFG for hp runs.  What do you mean about them doing runs with "basic masteries"?

Hey, i put the value on max: 1. The result is kind of bad. The fog has strong white color, in normal settings, it is far more subtle. There is an additional option which should be put on, but i dont know which exactly. Thx for your help so far.
---
This content seems cool but I don’t know if it’s a mini-expansion. A new race alone is so much work just to add new models to all the armor, let alone cities, maps, or new elite specialisations. This is already like 75% of a full coach.
---
These videos show only one of the bugs where a player is stuck on their mount.  Everyone can see when this bug occurs because the player appears standing on their mount to everyone.  The other is a graphics-only issue that shows up on only one side so not everyone can see when it is occurring.  Some people report having frame lag when it occurs while others report the opposite.
---
Can't do "new weapon with elite spec" forever. Warrior is down to just Caster items. And unless we get a focus which just disables our main-hand to let us punch stuff, we are out of options. They need to make new ways of using old weapons with new elite specs. 
---
And fishing? I don't see them ever adding a new gathering type, you could say this idea is "dead in the water".
---
So that said: Please let the next warrior elite spec be kits and punching. PLEASE LET THE NEXT WARRIOR ELITE SPEC BE KITS AND PUNCHING!
---
Hope to be a highly-skilled player in raids one day.  For now, I am new to this game.  I've done some traditional leveling with a couple other characters, but never got the xpac until now, so I didn't even know how to get the mount before reading the wiki!  The level boost was burning a hole in my pocket because I've been curious about Rev for a while.
---
Thats not the point here? This is literally about reaper compared to other classes. Noone is getting blamed or anything just compared
---
I totally agree that gem store skins probably maximize the profit per current player, but what they don't do is draw in new players, nor refresh existing players' interest in the game. A mini-DLC could do both -- a new race is a concrete draw for new players who want to start fresh, and new elite specs, maps, and crafting would help keep existing players coming back for longer.
---
Necro Pets "taunt" and bodyblock certain pulls, you for whatever reason often times can't drag mobs around if they're attacked by a pet.
---
a lot of people wouldn't pay for what we get in LW at the moment, there would have to be a lot more content and the storytelling would have to get better for it to be worth it, as it stands most people just play it because they can get it for free.
---
Spear?
---
Approx how much time is invested in wvw in order to obtain sufficient currency for this?  I've never excelled in PvP in any game.  Not including 2p Super Mario from 1986.
---
tangled depths, challenging, not brainless, best meta, made a bit too easy with mounts but still a masterpiece
---
"mini" -&gt; new capital city. New race. 9 elite specs. .... 
---
fog amount = 1 is GW2's default, but IIRC, it isn't GW2Hook's default. perhaps you're used to the latter and find the actual normal to be strange looking?
---
if fog amount = 1 looks bad to you, you should probably tweak the number a bit so it looks good for you. just keep in mind that the fog amount setting is hardcoded to 1 in pvp and wvw maps.
---
Yeah but having them unlocked doesn't help with knowing how to get to certain places between them cause everything always happens to be either above or below you haha
---
A 3D map would be really helpful
---
drip feed is not fun, it sounds like a good idea but in reality it just pisses people off once they realise they have to wait a couple of months to get the thing they really want, see gta onlines drip feeding cars and other shit
---
Right, stupid question but do raids also have tanks and healers?
---
Thanks, confused the two items together.
---
"Summon ones" would refer to the type where you don't fight anything?  I mean, maybe there's a veteran to clear first, but no hp boss type right?
---
Returning warrior player here. A lot of things has changed. I have full ascended viper set, but it seems condi is not as effective as it used to be.
---
Will it be sufficient to do fractals or should I go power instead?
---
I want this!!
---
I feel you man. I literally cannot play other games without wishing they had GW2's combat. 
---
It's like you met your soulmate and they were almost perfect, but now she refuses to see you anymore and no one will ever compare to her.
---
GW2... I can change
---
Sadly it did not work. I need to upload it on a different site and link it to this topic. I will try to tweek some settings and will answer shortly.
---
I payed for this X gold . Highest one to be one who spent most toward pvp sellers and botters.
---
Thank you.  Yes, on my Mesmer I found Chapter 7 to be extremely difficult at some points.  Lots of fast foot work, which I don't have.
---
Folks are loving the keys.  Is there something which can come in one of those chests which is madly sought after?  Best thing I think I've gotten was an xp booster.  I ask because many folks in this thread are talking about getting the keys.  That seems to be a priority.
---
Adapting old content no one cares about anymore sounds like a far worse idea to me.
---
If you want to experience that content, just create another character from another race. It's not like the 5 playable races don't have their own unique storylines anyway.
---
I would love a Metroid Prime map in GW2!
---
&gt; you just need to unlock some masteries for some of them
---
or progress far enough into the story
---
PoF was a flop for a MMO expansion. It's a single player game, dead weeks after arrival.
---
Definitely not the way to go.
---
U do realise they may take u seriously ?  
---
&gt; Wait, what? The more shrooms you eat, the more slublings spawn? Is that true?
---
It's definitely not. You get the same number of spawns regardless of whether you eat all the mushrooms or none. The only real variable is DPS.
---
Big ticket stuff usually on the weekends. 
---
Have to agree. Viper's medium leg armor is just a mini skirt for human females, leaving bare legs. Matches a lot of other pieces and is the perfect set-up for invisible boots, if you're into that kind of thing.
---
Thanks for the tip. I tried and unfortunately it didn't help.
---
I've tried reinstalling arc and launching the game many times. Didn't help.
---
It's useless for most everything but design but I love Caledon Forest so much.   I wish there wad more to do there.  But it's a starting area so nothing can be done there I guess.
---
"my friends are taking forever to get proper sneakers to play football..also why is the ball and the field unchanged since like forever?"

Well is there another parser that you could recommend?
---
Taunt on clones/phantasms? Yes please! 
---
High-LI pug raids are the biggest cancer in the game, no doubt.
---
I agree with you and I'm also baffled at the modern day Anet. 
---
Can you really expect people to continue to stick around at this point? I don't know about you but pretty much all of my friends and guild are taking breaks from the game and it's not looking good. The only reason many of us are still playing is because of the potential and our communities. Both of those things are fading rapidly. :(
---
arcdps.ini is inside the arcdps folder that is inside the addons folder inside your guild wars 2 folder, the one that contains the Gw2.exe file
---
I already tried deleting the whole bin64 folder and the arcdps folder in addons -&gt; arcdps, launch the game, download d3d9.dll but that didn't help. I don't have any weird permissions either.
---
NPCs have to walk to a waypoint to use one and as I have it understood is cheaper than hate travel but are limited to short distances, unlike gates. The npc having to walk to a waypoint is supported by the game itself. Many NPCs in LA are seen walking to a waypoint and vanishing and many are seeing appearing under one and walking away.
---
Well if you have a great Necro, he's a good player. He is good despite the fact that he plays Necro, if he'd change to any oher class he would also perform well.
---
You're not great as Necro, you're great despite Necro.
---
There are so many classes to choose from and you're playing the underdog. Its not even like you're forced to since you can easily swap equip and switch character.
---
Other classes and Meta ones too have a higher skill ceiling than the Necro, there are ones like Dragonhunters wich have a higher skill floor too tho, thats why your average dgh is performing so well but suffer from a low ceiling and can't pull of that much compared to "real" DDs. Guardian just like Mesmer bring a overbearing toolkit whatsoever and have an advntage this way.
---
If you play a Meta class you have the potential to deal much damage, definitly more so compared to an weird offmeta build. Certain classes allmost play themself, there is not much to learn but boss mechanics.
---
This is a little-known fact because the Viper trenchcoat covers the skirt
---
This is exactly why I discredit the comments about "selfish class" and "least utility" - it's based on old information/outdated knowledge, and basically makes that person's opinion in the current conversation worthless.

I found the solution to the view distance bug. I downloaded  Reshade FX Shader and added them to the gw2 hook configuration. With the new options, i can add some details which fill the gaps in the distance. Probably the presets i used needed these new options. Thanks a lot for the idea with the fog.
---
Some bosses you can really cheese with two heal necros and a druid.
---
 That's what I thought at first too tbh
---
It won't work for the simple reason that people will get pissed that certain elite specs would be released before others. 
---
Swap "of PvP" with "of Salt" and the titles are 110% accurate
---
Yes, usually 1 to 2 tanks, and 2 healers. Experienced groups may choose to run only 1 healer. 
---
Thank you for this! I never could finish HOT because it felt too group heavy and I didn't and still don't have but one friend on the game, my sister,  so most of the time it would be me soloing and that was absolute hell.  It also makes me sad I didn't get to experience the story properly. But at this point in time, because I didn't log in, I'd have to go buy gems to finish anyways. So guess I never will. So this really does help fill in the blanks.
---
Set it to private, sadly the DC issue still happened. :c
---
this, expansion is good because everyone has something to do... you play 2 hours a week? great, you have something to do for a year... you play 12 hours a day? great, you have something to do for months
---
mini expansions for 2h/w mean that many people already left for the new map and 12h/d is angry
---
I have and it made no difference. Thank you for trying to help me though.
---
I have the same idea but with Lornar's Pass. I absolutely loved it the first time I went there, and still do, really.
---
This is definitely one of the more feasible projections I've seen for a new race. There are a handful of trouble spots I'm certain, but the ideas for doubling down on pre-existing VA and a rig for clothing / animations would definitely take off a lot of the workload, and I think that's a really smart call to make to start off with in mind.
---
Also, fishing. Could it happen already? I have a mighty need. Please.
---
Why would I waste 2 hours on 99 cm?
---
[If Anet did honest advertising](https://ibb.co/p32rFd4)
---
I have an idea, since we "have to" (according to some in the community) get a dismounting trap: Magical Mount-Flypaper.
---
What do I mean by that? Just...if you're on a mount and pass over the trap, you become "stuck" to it for x seconds. Does it dismount you? No. Does it keep you immobilized if you dismount, or inflict some heavy conditions? Nope. Does it initiate combat? Not at all.
---
But for the duration, if you choose to remain mounted while stuck on this trap, your mount can't move. That's it. What this means is, you, the rider, can choose how to engage with this trap. Do you wait it out a bit to soak some damage from a ganker? Do you dismount, move a bit, and remount away from the trap to continue on your way? Do you instantly drop mount and go on the offensive?
---
It also means those placing the trap have to actually work for the kill. No Deadeye placing a trap, watching some hapless player get tripped and bucked from their mount on the trap, and Deadeye gets in their cheese kill while that enemy is stunned. No, that Deadeye needs to put a little effort into that engagement, now that the player is aware they may be in danger (and can therefore retaliate/fight back.)
---
Further, it prevents people from just placing it out in empty fields and dismounting hapless players just for kicks. Yeah, it'd be a minor hiccup as you're forced to dismount, move a few feet, and remount. But strategic placement around a Fort, for instance, or within a Camp could help a defender in their maneuvers, if they make use of it.
---
These ideas for instantly dismounting and/or inflicting a heap of nasty conditions just sound like unabashed punishment for utilizing a new mainstay of the mode. Aka, they sound like a salt brigade that doesn't like the change and wants to "punish" it. A mount-based trap doesn't need to simply dismount, and in fact for balancing purposes, that would probably be the hardest to achieve any semblance of balance with. Hence a "flypaper" mechanic.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; A new playable race means to create over 50 armor sets (x3 because we have 3 armor types), dozens single armor pieces and over 70 outfits only to give Tengu the armors we already have ingame.
---
That has never happened in any other games, and wouldn't happen here either.
---
I really like this, but aside from the map count it basically is an expansion - I would also really enjoy if this was the next expansion, but mapped all of the sea of sorrows and ring of Fire, and dealt with primordus
---
Sadly my frame limiter is already set to unlimited. 
---
Yes I downloaded the arc.ini into addons/arcdps and changed the build number. Still getting the same error.
---
There were tengu fighting with the Pact during the campaign against Zhaitan.
---
That said, it would be fine if all the older storylines were just not available for the new races.
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I pvp occasionally or roam around in wvw for a bit because the combat is amazing and the game had potential. My long friend list of people I've meet in the guild or in wvw is mostly greyed out, showing their last login would make it even more depressing. 
---
I guess I'm just hoping for a renewed focus from anet and I bet lots of inactive people also do. 
---
A dismount trap could be interesting - another way to interact with the mechanics of the game with actual impact.
---
What I also want to see is Battle Maul dismounting enemy players, less health on the Warclaw and susceptibility to *some* CC. Warclaw is great for getting from A to B so you can engage in content more readily, but its current iteration also leads to the bypassing of emergent WvW scenarios. Watching enemy players just galloping past one another because there's no means  for either side to actually start a fight reliably, is a rather sad sight to behold.
---
Well, we swapped over to hybrid domi/illu mesmers at some point and BiP became meta to fuel them, so that's not insignificant changes.
---
why is everyone so against match manipulation. i personally find it okay as it prepares everyone for the real world. arenanet just wants us to have a strong foundation and not be dissappointed on how the real world works. 
---
I'm not using it to justify anything, I'm merely pointing out, Necro seems to have by far the most issues compared to any other class. I'm excessively fine with Necro, it's just anyone who commands with pugs is going to always be wary due to the outliers and it's hard for a comm to judge when there's this blatant bias that has grains of truth in it.
---
Yeah, you can't attach screenshots in Reddit comments, gotta use a hyperlink.
---
Sounds more prestigious, especially because "God of the Mists" could also sound like a WvW or PvE title.
---
One last thing, you can use one of the level boosts from an expansion purchase to try out level 80 classes without making the boost final.  That was how I explored how many of the classes felt without having to level them all in the beginning.
---
...not without heavy casualties.

Just make the first 10 spots "Gods of wintrading" and call it a day because that's about all it is atm. Anet doesn't punish people unless it's for verbal abuse even at the smallest possible scale.

Thanks I've been searching a bit and I don't have what's being used for raids (chrono tank, druid supp, for dps I have a mesmer, scourge, warrior and ele dunno who's more noob friendly for raids) can you give me a tip on where should I start?
---
Kinda like what Elder Scrolls Online does.
---
Also the music is the shit.
---
I'm glad some of it is reused in crstal oasis (and i think the other POF maps) They convey so well the vastness of the empty desert.
---
Thing is, there is button on the crystals that must be pushed to activate them.  That is why my characters where skirts and carry Purel.
---
*activates all buffs*
---
I've never noticed that! Can you point to a specific waypoint or NPC that does it so I can see it for myself?
---
I honestly wasn't focusing on the game that much and j was mostly back capping points. Only realised right at the end that it was a Chrono not a mirage when I went into a 1v1 with it and it used a well on me. I checked it's icon and it was definitely a mirage. I was like wtf, kept fighting and then shortly after, we lost. I have no reason to lie about this. I was just asking to see if this is a known have or if I encountered a weird bug.
---
Oh dw, I got kicked at the launch of raids for being a DD main because "Tempest staff meta"...
---
and also last month in a Deimos I got"DD dps sucks on range *kicked*"... I was going to join on DH but god forbid I join on the class I was using on another wing before I join you group and give 3 seconds to write something...- _ -.
---
Hack not have
---
No arguing with that.
---
That looks pretty damn cool... if only I wasn't madly in love with big crit numbers
---
Does this rely on dodges like the daredevil builds?
---
Wooooow. New PvP content! /s
---
For dyes, people will typically give away cheap ones that they open in map/guild chat. You can also get some pretty expensive dyes from your birthday gifts; I’ve never really spent gold on dyes. 
---
I kind of like it for that aspect though, it will fit in more if you choose to wear it elsewhere
---
Man, people and their metas, ruins most multiplayer games for me. I'm glad this game at least has every class playable, but those kinds of people really work on my nerves.
---
I too like the idea of a tenth mini-expack.
---
I also just really love Tengu.
---
&gt; Never saw Anet nerfing something to the ground like that. 
---
*&gt;Laugh in Perma Shadowform nerf and skelleton of Dhumm in Guild Wars 1.* 
---
This is definitely wrong.  If the meta is speed clears that 5% of the high end community does then yes holo is out.  However for the meta of actually clearing the boss, holo is one of the more effective dps classes due to the combination of CC, cleave, durability, and ease of rotation.
---
I actually prefer the "Of PvP" myself as I think titles aren't lore friendly anyway.
---
We will see though, someone made that suggestion in the thread.
---
Great idea but I fear they might be cornered into a limit of content if they choose a cheaper price. I know we'd like a full expansion with the tengu :p
---
Haha yes. The comment from Brendan.1309 was also funny. He recommended to swap "of PvP" to "of Match Manipulation".
---
Just want to back this up. No Anet employees have mod privileges here and for as long as I have been a mod the only messages we have had from ANet have been regarding dev interaction already happening or with the layoffs pasts devs letting us know to remove their tag. No Anet employee has ever asked us to ban a user or remove content (other than maybe exploits, which are already against the rules).
---
Shit man, not off the top of my head. Try the area near the guild HQ. Also as for NPCs there isn't one specifically. Random NPCs will do it.
---
Same content as before...with maybe a new infusion, at best - that's what I expect to see.
---
It would give an incentive for roamers to cap and protect camps more
---
Our favourite comp for cheesing is two chrono, one heal temp, seven scourges 😁 
---
Did you want to address any of my other points, or really any of them at all?
---
There's just some games that I don't enjoy watching others play, for some reason. GW2 is one of them, and Diablo, I recall, was another one.
---
Fair play to the ladies and gents who youtube and stream, though! I truly do admire all their energy. 
---
Items that most people want / buy I.e. bank storage, copper-fed salvage, character slots, etc..
---
People are talking about raids and fractals though. Besides, dungeons are so  laughably easy due to powercreep that it feels like you're nitpicking at this point.
---
Build a ballista and shoot them the 4 skill. It removes gliding and dismounts enemies.
---
I actually think it's kinda fun. I like to imagine my Charr is ice skating while I'm fighting :-P 
---
To each their own. Not what I wanted from a heavy set. 
---
For a good reason (way too much effort for like zero content). 
---
Most games used to make the most important equipments available so the new race/class will get the intresting, high end stuff, but less low level equipment. 
---
But keep in mind that GW2 is all about fashion. A race with significant less skins than other races is a huge thing and for many ppl it would be a big point to not choose this race. 
---
Ben, there are more important issues in this game mode than the name of titles...
---
According to forums every spec is broken.
---
I love this. Give me playable Tengu and I'm back. Back for good.
---
It will never happen because their armor system sucks, they would never be able to fit the old armor to tengu's so they would need to make 10 new tengu only armor sets? not going to happen lol.
---
Yeah, I'm not a fan of watching GW2 gameplay, aside from raids, either. His series just focuses on the lore of the game, and I find Tyria quite compelling :)
---
Well it's a yearly festival. The whole point of a yearly festival is that it's basically the same every year. :)
---
I love it. The brochure is also very nicely crafted.
---
I want fishing more than anything 
---
Big ticket items are generally account or character upgrades -- like character slots, bag slots, bank tabs, shared inventory slots, etc. -- as well as Black Lion Keys. Things that lots of players will jump on when they go on sale.
---
The weekday sales, on the other hand, tend to be more about appearance: outfits, armor skins, weapon skins, etc. Stuff that will definitely get some people impulse buying, but aren't generally what people are saving up for.
---
What about a new siege? Give us the possibility to build anti-cavalry spikes. I'm not sure how best it would function but it would be highly visible to mounted players. You could build walls and tunnel zergs into strategic locations.
---
We have gotten almost a year of fresh festival content. The events team was certainly been busy bringing back the gauntlet and four winds, redoing old stuff in halloween and bringing it back with new stuff, we got a wintersday dungeon, and a little refreshment of Canthan New year content. So while my hopes aren't high, I do hope we see something new; maybe even a final boss fight to give SAB some closure.
---
Time to work on my yellow weapon collection.
---
If you're a reaper you should know that you shouldn't go into shroud when the party has low health. And btw, with 20k health it's hard to go down - you or you healer should have messed something.
---
Other top dps are as selfish as reaper as someone before me stated and it still brings decent CC and good cleave damage.

not anymore since Josh quit :(

I know Xera is a meh boss and my rotation isn't that great, but I still think I pulled my weight as a Reaper. They have so much cleave, it's nice. I'm 5th on Squad 2.
---
I still pug with Scourge and Reaper on NA raids. I haven't gotten kicked yet though for just my class.
---
Look for a gaming mouse with a lot of buttons.  I tried a few of the "numpad" style mice (like the Logitech G600 and Corsair Scimitar) but my thumb got lost on the pad. Lots of people love them though.
---
I also tried variants on that theme, but the Logitech G602 gave me wrist pain with my grip...and the Roccat Nyth...well, I could probably use it (with its customizable thumb button area) and be happy...
---
But then I tried the Roccat Leadr, and I think it's the best mouse for me. Tons of buttons, but not in that grid layout, but rather spread all over the thing.
---
I would try to find a guild here: https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/
---
ya...this is totally what needs attention in PvP right now smh
---
I stand corrected. I could have sworn that they remained completely outside of the battles and focused internally. I don't remember any storyline interactions with them.
---
Especially since the W3 and W4 houses still exist in the lobby, W3 and W4 still exist on the map, the entire gameplay / story flow just stops abruptly with the Storm Wizard fight and the gnome bandit onslaught afterwards. No princess saved, no evil big boss fought, nothing. So ansatisfying.
---
Thus i wish that ArenaNet commits to one thing, W3 or W4 either being developed or not, and if the latter is the case, removing / altering the narrative introduction at the start and removing all other signs of W3 and W4. It's just so incredibly teasing these things are still around, after four years of being told "we currently don't have the resources".
---
Thanks again
---
Anything releasing over the next few months was far enough along in development not to be affected by those layoffs. And SAB probably wasn't impacted at all by them.
---
Thanks.
---
Honest question at this point, why are people so awful at Siren's Reef. This fight really isn't that hard, but time and time again people ignore chat despite being reminded to take the target away, stack for the green, and largely just seem to get distracted by trying to kill all the infinitely respawning trash and fall off the boat.
---
It seems like this Fractal is part of the dailies almost every single day and yet it still takes over an hour to finish it every day.
---
I don't know what that person said, but my take is that the images posted by the OP do look A LOT like Sylvari.
---
[Enjoy!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b0cku9/didnt_play_for_23_years/eidny96/)

Strange, I can use 's and Masquerade without a problem ( [https://imgur.com/a/Y94kukN](https://imgur.com/a/Y94kukN) ) - which keyboard layout do you use?
---
Good concept, but I feel like tengu would be better in that wooded area north of DR.
---
You under estimate the power of a shiny new race.
---
Dude, no. Getting 20 sups is hilariously trivial, and I don't even consider myself that much of a vet.
---
Yeah, can’t say you didn’t deserve the ban. 
---
I'm using a apex row from steel series in an AZERTY disposition
---
condi core engi/holosmith with bomb and grenade kit is solid for raids, theres also power holo  if you dont like condi gameplay, if you like a more supportive role then heal scrapper gonna cover it, its often used as a secondary healer in raids, i dont have much experience with fractals so can't say much, i'd imagine power holo is good there,now for open world you can make a build with any class/spec work, its a legit play what you like in this scenario
---
...huh. That was impressive. Wow.
---
Thanks for posting, mate.
---
season 2-4 is new then
---
No offence to Josh Foreman the man is a genius at creating environments but I think people give him all the credit for SAB. There was a whole team who created the festival lets share the appreciation.

i just want the final part to be re-introduced with the SAB genie and sabotaging the other asura with its NES style panel. only thing i missed back then and its the only part i want to get  achance to do, for completionist sakes
---
I don't know, if AZERTY uses the same ' as my QWERTZ, but i really don't undestand the problem with Masquerade as atleast the letters should be the same on both layouts. After which letter does Masquerade stop to work in the search box?

Tybalt, introduction.
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
people having fun in wvw?!?!! impossible!!!! i suggest promote the cat to commander for the your next guild raid :D all these little silly moments is what glues a guild together.
---
Yes. Yessssss. YYEEEEEEESSSSSSS!
---
Ads are getting smarter.
---
&gt; Better social media implementation
---
I know where this will go already and OH HELL NO. I absolutely abhor when games, especially PC games, especially fantasy games, forcefully integrate with Faceinstatwitchttergrams and shove social media into your face at every possible occasion. No, keep that selfie, share and like crap out of my fantasy; k thx bye.
---
Nugget has a higher item level than the sword.  It's an incompatible upgrade.  If you want to use the Nugget get a level 20+ sword. 
---
Yeah I'm still _very_ curious about network performance
---
Good that it works now, some bugs are strange
---
I like the idea of the Ogdens Hammer  What Savings guy turning up in Merchants Haven... I'd buy the expansion just for this!
---
Looks better than sylvaris do normally by a longshot imo, mainly due to the face (left one only, right one looks just creepy to me).
---
Wtf this commander even on for? Kill proof and legendary insight needed to join his raid training too? Xd 
---
I think you're well equipped in armor and weapon. I'd like everyone to be in full exotics and do some homework on important mechanics or anything least watch a 5 mins video on a boss fight before we get started cuz knowledge is everything. Then during the fight, the more questions you have, ask away, cuz it'll make you understand mechanics better. 
---
Back when there was bgdm dps meter, there was a full rare gear tempest and he out dps ascended ones by a small margin. And he proved that knowing mechanics and class rotation is bigger than gears. Gears just show dedication for the class if you want to go for that class in end game content, imo. 
---
I think you can do better with many training guilds.
---
A tengu expansion would print money for anet. Players been asking for it for 7 years 
---
Yes we did, and a legendary trinket

[Digital Foundry](https://youtu.be/VG06H7IQ9Aw?t=682) got 166ms latency over a google internet connection. Add to that your normal ping and decide for yourself if game streaming is the future for you.
---
Yes, I even see him on some twitch streams, even on GvG ones.
---
How does it fit on charr?
---
They’ll just stretch everything to fit them like they do with charr
---
Yupp
---
The only thing I hate about sandswept isles is the sharks constantly knocking me off the skimmer. I would be okay with it if it wasn't happening so commonly but every 5-10 seconds is just ridiculous. It should be like once every minute or just rare to happen.
---
Also, the bounty bosses are just ridiculous but that's not limited to sandswept isles.
---
Pants.
---
No. This is wrong.
---
The bottleneck will still be anet's servers, so Stadia won't give you reduced latency.
---
DD: At least I have dodge mechan- oh...
---
&gt; Especially since the W3 and W4 houses still exist in the lobby, W3 and W4 still exist on the map,
---
The houses means nothing, they exist since first released and we didn't even have W2 back then. 
---
Also the "map", it's nothing more than a rough overview, a thing where existing maps take place, nothing else. 
---
Both are nothing more than placeholder for possible future worlds, just to be open for more. 
---
And Anet told us what it takes to create a 3rd world compared to creating a normal new map, so we know how unlikely it is to get a new world. 
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, I would love to get a new SAB world and it's not wrong to still hope for it, but nobody should demand it or be disappointed, if there is no new world. We know the chances.
---
Well, if some people are fine with the complex active combat of GW
---
&gt; on phones and tablets too!
---
, then I guess ping wouldn't be that much of a priority for them.
---
Everything.
---
could also have accidentally hit a key combination for switching keyboards although that is only relevant if you actually have multiple installed.
---
Google doesnt need gw2 pleb for marketing
---
Black Lion Chest Keys are basically the closest thing to a true lootbox we have (While the mount licenses give you skins at random, once it's unlocked, it's account-wide, and won't drop again). While the contents do rotate, some skins can only be gotten through it, and there's permanent versions of some consumable items in there. The biggest difference is that you can get the keys without having to really buy them from the shop-they'll rarely drop from enemies, they're story rewards (though as mentioned, the Level 10 quest reward one is limited to one per week), chance to get them through map completion...
---
AB will forever be nostalgic for me. I picture myself 10 years from now being like "those were the good times".
---
Hell, I already find myself thinking that.
---
Hopefully there will be new purple colored weapons! Long Live the legendary Josh Foreman. &lt;3 
---
I see, that's weird... No idea what's going on.
---
this is a question being asked more than once i believe but i wish to know it personally. where else to farm t6 mats besides the dead istan map now? 
---
To be fair, you’d need a new starting area, new city, etc.
---
&gt; Instant game launch - since game updates will be performed in data centers, and as the game is streamed, no more downtime when there are patches!
---
Uh not quite. You still have to restart. Given the bandwidth requirements for this the average patch will be downloaded very quickly as well. That is assuming you fully patch before playing. If you use the game's already existing data streaming options then it will be even quicker.
---
That is a potential selling point for the platform but it doesn't offer much in the case of GW2.
---
&gt; No more WvW network lag - Data centers act as both game clients and game servers - this would greatly optimize WvW gameplay by reducing lag/skill lag
---
Magic does not exist ...
---
Fractals switched from toughness scaling to vitality making power good again and swapping all meta builds back to power. The meta [banner warrior](https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior) in fractals runs power. In raids it's the opposite though and [condi berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/banner/) gets more DPS on most fights and is viable on the rest.
---
I love engineer and consider myself lucky that I picked it as my first class. Its the jack of all trades, master of none.
---
Some classes are a pain to level, but all classes are good for PvE.
---
This is humorous because I DID do that last year. It took 2 weeks, and the account cleared every boss in exotics. Had no issues getting into pugs, and only had one bad issue (someone wanted to do solo healer no green vg, and assumed I was in minstrels, which, nope!). I then got the tag unlocked, and had 0 issues since. To top it off, I even had it on EU which has HARDER entrance issues than NA. 
---
Raids are easy to get into, and no one really cares as long as you know what’s going on. So do the research. 
---
I then went on to gear a harrier druid in full ascended using ONLY raid currency, and found even more groups. The class I used the most? Kitless sword holo. Was usually #1 or #2 on the dps table. Also, Prete triggers me now... (fuckin French groups!!)
---
INAL. could this spell a CnD or something from Anet? They might not want to go up against (I think EA..??) but its pretty fucking close.
---
Aurene dragonblood legendary greatsword?
---
I've not had it not crash in a good while, so your mileage may vary.
---
As a pvp-only player I dont give a damn about „lore“. But I would want to have other players recoginze my pvp rank through the title (when i’m roaming in wvw for example).
---
I can't think of any examples right now but I'm pretty sure plant people with leafy hair and stuff have been a thing long before guild wars.
---
Zero interest in this.
---
Speaking entirely personally: I prefer to *purchase* games to play, and tailor my hardware to do so. Even subscriptions to access games-as-services is a little outside of my comfort zone and I do it only because it's the norm.
---
The idea of outsourcing the game itself so heavily that my hardware interacts with it and impacts my experience *less* is just not good for me.
---
Nothing said of the potential licensing and other remote shutdown issues inherent in X-as-service systems, I don't like the idea of being reliant on my internet connection more than I already am. I live in central Canada, and **CANNOT** access a better connection than 10mbps down and 2mbps up currently - and peering agreement issues already make more choices for me about what media I can reliably use/appreciate than I like.
---
I think unfortunately, Stadia is just too many levels of abstraction away from realistic improvement to the gaming experience as things are now, and I have zero confidence that will change.
---
No thanks.
---
no, only you.
---
A dismount trap? You mean playing ranger and stacking every trap on a congestion zone?
---
I think the highest Anet can go is t3 in most of their live stream stuff about fractals. Lol.
---
I do love the new instabilities and the randomized makes it challenge, fresh, and fun. It's gonna be si much different with each daily fractal and i love it! I don't understand why people moaning so hard about. 
---
I was once popped in a t4 daily CM meme and there is a dev joined us. But he waited till we pre cast boons before show us his power. Lol. He popped and rep Anet guild so we see the icon. I was just so hyped over the top. Lol
---
I am a PvP player too and I do care, and it sounds pretty bad imo
---
What did you do? Why there are so many children in your home instance? Lol
---
&gt; Join Parties or Squads from streams - Again, stream watchers will be able to launch games but also join current matches from browsers (from YouTube, Tweets, comments, anything really) - Imagine people video streaming WvW sessions - other people could join in squads or parties through Stadia seamlessly.
---
-This requires a lot more work than just plug and play and for GW2 would most likely require a ton of development time.
---
&gt; Quickly join World Boss instances - See previous point - this one is simply focused on major events. People could be tweeting or Discord'ing events and people will be ablt to join the same map instances.
---
See above
---
&gt; Optimize performance - now this one is limited to some players as GW2 is not hardware heavy, but everyone knows the engine is not properly optimized. That said, players with reaaally crappy PCs will be able to run GW2 with max'd settings
---
Probably true but it would still have to be optimized to run with Stadia, Stadia is not normal hardware, it is Googles own design. Again lots of dev work
---
&gt; Better social media implementation - Again with livestreams, tweets, galleries, tutorials etc etc, greater presence for GW2 and bigger audience.
---
Lot of these can be done now just not directly integrated with the game.
---
What downtime? Patches come out instantly and there is rarely anytime the servers are actually down. Games that do have actual downtime like Star Trek Online make do just fine.
---
Still depends on peoples connections themselves. It won't fix lag and Stadia is going to be worse for PvP type modes than PvE/single player
---
&gt; Console gaming - Stadia is cross-platform compatible, if it can be streamed on consoles, people wil be able to play GW2 on Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch etc etc
---
&gt; On the go gaming - Streamable on phones and tablets too! ON THE GO GW2!
---
Stadia requires the Chrome browser. Unless Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony are willing to put the Chrome browser or a Stadia app on their hardware, it will NOT work on consoles.
---
Dunno, if i would be #1 ranked pvp player, i would want ppl to recognize this fact solely by looking at the title...
---
Don't do this to me, I've wanted to play as them for almost 7 years now (well even longer, I've liked their design since Prophecies and really fell in love with them in Factions) since I've read they were almost playable in the book that came with the collector edition. At this point I'd even take a combat tonic even though that would be a shame with what they could do in the character creation but I just want to play as a bird samurai.
---
the huge outrage is usually because innocent players are caught in the crossfire, especially the banwave that installed spyware on your pc and marked you as a cheater if it could not access the files of other profiles on your PC. no one complains when the highly publicised match manipulators and cheaters get banned, maybe because it almost never happens (and when it does it's a slap on the wrist) or maybe because the community is the one doing the legwork and have to get their facts straight, unlike anet who just ban you until 8 months later when a player conducts their own investigation and finds out how badly the spyware was implemented. 
---
Yeah the male version is plate armor, the female version fetish gear.
---
A real shame.
---
that is probably the best approach if you do not care about pvp, unless you feel that some of the titles would be a bit misleading ( like the dude said, military ranks are more fitting for wvw )
---
Do we keep old titles? Sorry if I missed that part of the post.
---
A new playable race is a **lot** of lines for voice actors to record and rerecord.
---
I'd opposed to bunker playstyle. That is anything but strategic speaking term. You're bunkering so you're prepping to 1v1 and even 1v2 if they plus on you. So you won't just stand there and get farmed over and over. It'll be tons of clicking or smashing buttons, plus reflexes. 
---
There are 3 classes in mind that suit what you're looking for. Necro, mesmer, and thief. 
---
For anyone says scourge is easy, you probably don't play within platinum tier or top 250 where power creep exist and you could get down in less than a second if you stand on a one spot or rotate to a point you shouldn't. Reaper is even harder to play cuz lots more kiting to generate your life force before rekt people and it's more predictable than scourge when it comes to entering reaper shroud. If people get out of your radius, strip your stability or stun and rekt your shroud altogether, you're as vulnerable as you can be. It's very calculated on necro playstyle and why i chose to main it for sPvP and WvW. It's very rewarding if play right. You'll apply constant pressure to enemy team on a large scale cuz aoe.
---
Mirage/chrono and daredevil is a bit sneaky playstyle. They're roaming classes and plus one. So they'll decide a team fight win if their rotation is on point. Or you'd have to decide when to drop a fight so you could steal a beast or decap somewhere, etc. It's super calculating. Or you can go full damage and nuke enemies fast and force the rest to drop that node or go somewhere else. 
---
The rest of the classes could be just as great these are strategic imo. 
---
Fair enough, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it then, but it's definitely a different experience than just playing the story.
---
There's a reason this took 120 long episodes, and it's because WP has included a lot of the different branches you can go down and shown a lot of the tie-ins you normally don't notice. I've played the personal story a few times over the years but a lot of this was new to me.
---
No new worlds.
---
I kind of wish they made world 3 and 4 not based on platformers like the rest, but give it more variety (and make it easier to make by not having to worry su much bout jumps) by making them more like other styles of old video games.
---
So we would have:
---
* World 1 : Mario-like platformer 
---
 * Mostly linear and melee attacks. 
---
 * We already have this.
---
* World 2 : Metroidvania platformer
---
 * More complex and more optional areas, more bactracking and needs more ranged attacks. 
---
 * Also already done. 
---
* World 3 : Action Adventure  Zelda.  
---
 * The entire world is 1 map with 3 mini-dungeons. 
---
 * Areas require keys and special items to access.
---
 * Puzzle rooms.
---
 * Players can unlock a super lizard mount that works mostly like raptor and can only be used within this world to move faster over the map and between the dungeons.
---
* World 4 : Shooter/brawler like Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Cadillacs &amp; Dinosaurs, and Metal Slug 
---
 * At certain spots players can ride unique specific mounts with combat skills.  
---
 * The 'shortcut' is large ride that runs over enemies while avouding obstacles, and regains health with pickups, similar to the cadillac levels in cadillacs and dinosaurs.
---
 * The last level is more shooter-like and features a bullet hell boss.
---
20h30 utc. 21h30 french hour. I usualy open squad around 20h utc and then share advices for both map and squad.

Cause it'll make more work to remove those placeholder assets than to just leave them in as is.

Yeah they rotated them in recently around the start of these sales. Been waiting for the Trickster chest piece for a while now so I immediately grabbed it 😊
---
Why mini, I want a full on expac. Leggo!

My motivation to get guild wars 2 was just because i could make sylvari, because i played sims 2 as a kid and i loved that game to the bone.

We have, they suck
---
You had me at new elite specializations. Easily my favourite part of expansions because they freshen up a huge chunk of the game.
---
If its like GW1 its not permanent as soon as you get to where you were i.e. 499,800 you can continue it.
---
Cuz essence is the obvious kp for 100cm. Jade fragments are just drops. By acquiring 100cm kp, any other CM would be easier and it'll make people know your proficiency based on how many drops you have. 
---
Usually 99cm shouldn't ask for kp if it's snowballing from 100cm. But it depends on the one put up the lfg i guess. I know i drop plenty of 100cm after it's done cuz I can't stand elitism. So I'd just join another t4s group. Finish everything and that group is still on lfg. Lol. Not feel bad at all. 
---
20 minutes od Dragon's Stand should do it.
---
I would buy it. I always want to be a tengu
---
If you choose to use elementals to tank, be sure to summon from Water or Earth. Fire and Air elementals don't do a great job of tanking. 
---
Constantly bringing classes up just means more power creep. Bringing classes down preserves PvE difficulty. Look at dungeons, they are a cakewalk because even a group of druids can blow up the mobs. If they keep "bringing up" itll just mean that eventually they have to increase mob hp or retweak encounters.
---
I don't mean in a blog episode 6 of season 3 was announced a week or 2 on twitter before the trailer.
---
Define farm, its not really about making gold (apart from RNG chance at a drop from last chest)
---
Damn, you're ducking good at decorating.
---
i wish we had few more of these type of title to earn would make game interesting to play sort like hardmode in itself with each new char.
---
I meant the event specific items, I've been watching some YouTube videos but I like to see if anyone else knows of sources I haven't found. I'm actually not looking to make gold off of it I just want to collect as many skins and items such as the home node as possible. 
---
Yessss shouts. Hahaha. I love how people can fill in the blanks 
---
Ooh, imagine instead of just plain shouts they actually made the voiceovers for siren shouts to seem a little sing-song? That little touch to just. Yes. Take my money. 
---
Its cool that you mentioned that and well, I am playing WoW for 11years now and occasionally some League of Legends.
---
In League Meta shifts often but you have some classes wich get great buffs or reworks and their winrate dropps to shit (below 45%) because they get played by a bunch of total noobs.
---
In WoW you have the same phenomena where classes have a slim advantage above others and so most pro players choose them to abuse this advantage.
---
This shifts community perception, because those lesser played classes must be bad, right? If you look at logs you'd see that they're usually perform very well but thats just because those hardcore Class-Mains didn't switch to the new flavour of the month. Players who know their classes ins and out usually deal high dps.
---
Thing is that if you have 2 players with the same skill on a champion the flavor of the month is actually performing accordingly.
---
If you filter equipment and difficulty level and check for players within the same brackets, you'll find that the percieved class is indeed slightly better.
---
In League of Legends and World of Warcraft you can check that to be reassured. The developer or community provides you with those informations. I know its deep into theorycrafting and far away from gameplay but those meta changes do matter aspecially in a game like gw2 where Necros don't bring anything to the table besides dps (maybe boonstrip or some pulls etc.) but look at Powerchrono, he can pull too - argueably better, hase teleports, portals, insane CC, boonstrip, reflection, longrange and shortrange dps and also support.
---
You are not good being a Necro, you are good despite playing Necro.
---
*look for a class with more potential*
---
Not really. Someone still has to buy the keys. And they would inevitably end up being a very stable price in gold, so it wouldn't be much different from converting gold into gems to buy them. Having lootbox keys be tradeable worked out just fine in tons of other games.
---
And thars a perfectly fine finish imo. Having a end to motos story
---
i guess i will do a video comparison in fractals, raids, meta events, wvw and pvp.
---
but hope you guys keep in mind that its impossible to reproduce the exact same scenario
---
You can also use your spirit shard to upgrade T5 materials to T6 for a bit more profit 
---
&gt; customizable colorblind filter
---
So many times people asked that from anet, and so many times I said that it was a job for 3rd party tool common to all games&amp;software, not a job for each game company to reinvent the wheel (and have to test all colorbind versions).
---
It FINALLY comes directly from Nvidia, and this is GREAT.
---
I think they need more frequent updates honestly.
---
Thank you for this list!
---
Thanks, will take a look!
---
How do I go about doing this?
---
Dragon's Stand because the entire map is one giant, sometimes frantic meta event. 
---
I think the Orr maps would be my favorite if they were more fleshed out lore-wise. I have a love/hate relationship with Tangled Depths. I just love Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Oh yeah, just from memory in EQ1; Froglok(bipedal frogs), Vah'Shir(catfolk), Iksar(lizards) were added in expansions
---
EQ2 added another lizard/dragon race that were enemies primarily in EQ1's Rise of Kunark expansion called...  Sarnak?  I forget, but they became playable in an EQ2 expansion.  Pretty sure they have released more, too.
---
That's why I kinda implied in my first comment that I both like it and hate it, depending on the mood
---
Draconis Mons is out of this world. I think I spend 8 whole evenings of free time in a row just exploring every inch of it and memorizing the whole layout, and it was so fun. 
---
Tybalt, recap.

Yes, commander.

* [Season two](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2)
---
* [Season three](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3)

1) We made dozens of spears in episode 5
---
2) What should that change? To kill Kralk is not the main problem now, since Aurene is dead. Even if we could kill him, without Aurene there is nobody/nothing who could absorb all his magic and prevent Tyria from being destroyed. Nobody to bring back the magic balance in Tyria. 
---
So having a way to kill Kralk is useless atm.
---
Thats really amazing go up to all the people who said a 2700x was overkill for gaming and show them that !!
---
Wait, they changed that? I deleted 3 toons while working on getting that achievement. Was a lot of me standing way back and letting my heroes kill things...
---
Anomaly is up
---
&gt; Maybe since she branded Kralkatorrik there's some resonant link between them.
---
Aurene is the scion of Glint -&gt; a dragon minion. She ever had the same resonance as Kralk. That's why Balthazar used her for his machine in PoF story.
---
Really well done. I'm in awe of the amount of time (1 year!) and effort. And I was glad to learn a done of details I never knew, despite doing all(?) the story arcs.. (Though I'm likely to forget most of it...)
---
Wait, weren't you that guy who made that massive-ass post awhile back on basically making the whole game P2W based on an Asia market-model? Something about offering the possibility to buy legendaries straight up with gems from the gem store? You were arguing about how it wasn't pay-to-win, when everything you described in the post was quite literally what pay-to-win was.  
---
I can't verify it, because it seems you've deleted the post since then, but your username is one I definitely recognise.  
---
Let's say for a moment (like pretend) that you did have legitimate ideas that were being discriminately removed, that still wouldn't stop you from potentially getting banned for being rude to other redditors, which you were, and clearly are here as well...
---
Why doesn't this have 6 billion upvotes already?

it wobbles when you use it.
---
I think all new specializations should be inspired in the Tengu. With that Kung Fu chinese vibe. I once talked about an elementalist in tune with the planet itself and they could use traps. The water trap could be a well of water. The Ground trap could lift spikes. The Wind trap could electrocute and paralyze the enemy. And the fire trap would be for damage.
---
Since traps are mostly a stealth mechanic, the specialization weapon should be a longbow. 
---
Good point. Probably not the best word choice on my part.
---
I’m sure there is but have no idea where you can find them as seem most builds are the common meta.
---
I have been running a condi soulbeast , and the damage is just crazy, it start slow but as you build dots the enemies just melt.
---
I run it with short bow/ dagger, torch 
---
The best thing I could tell you is experiment ,  find the weapons you want to use and enjoy and start reading what the skills do and what specialization skills do and pick them according to your weapons and your play style.
---
Hope this help, if you are on EU , I have a friend she can help you with understanding of your skills and give yuh an idea of what to do ^^
---
Cheers
---
Omg I can actually chime in on this because I did a wood farm recently for the next legendary. I managed to get almost 300 logs a character every 20 mins, 3 times a day with a glyph of industry. I'll elaborate more when I'm not on mobile 
---
It was awesome. Great ending, great build up. I'm eager to see the rest of his Let's Plays!
---
Boonbeast is really op in small/solo roaming. U have generally ability to fight any other class/player 1v1 or enter 1vX and still be able to disengage if to many come. Condi remove is great, dmg is good plus u get a lot stab , breaks and so on. 
---
On other hand u have pew pew that may seem fun , 1 burst for gg, but its boring and show no skill. Plus , so called boonbest will counter also that pew pew one :).
---
In any case soulbeast is atm quite superb to almost anything for solo. 
---
Ohhhh, that is not what I meant. But thank you for information.
---
Another problem is all the living world seasons have to be individuals and can't have things that combine all the maps like an expac can. Basically instead of all the maps being relevant, only the newest one will be. Creates a bunch of one and done content which is stupid for an mmo. 
---
Stadia sounds to me like genital disease
---
Not much to do. Just here sitting in chairs. 
---
Mate, you’re so far off the deep end it’s weird.
---
Why did you take new people to w6? That is NOT a w6 fight. Deimos is a tank and spank if 3 roles know what they’re doing.. hell you can damn near auto attack and finish it via ranged. VG is absolutely a tank and spank, even for new people, how do I know? I just trained one with only me as a vet. We had a druid and a heal scourge and beat it just by tanking and spanking. You can’t say it’s “only experienced people tank and spank”.
---
As for the “they’re all elitist pricks”, you obviously have never talked to them. Otherwise you’d know they’re constantly trying to promote more newbie friendly builds that can carry the fight! Hell, they once considered an entire second website just for different builds, so you didn’t have to do meta. 
---
Small builds do have the issues of too many or too little, I give you that. But ya know what? That’s up to the guild to decide how to handle it. I used to command for small raid guilds, I gave priority to those who showed up, those who wanted progress, not a carry. 
---
As it stands, raids are too easy, and after a point, there’s no reason to run it anymore. But you cannot say it’s hard to get into, and claim it’s all these LI restrictions, when I 1) proved it wasn’t by doing so on the EU server, and 2) know for a fact NA doesn’t give two shits about LI, and normally just ask “Ping anything”.
---
You really have no idea what you’re talking about. Later mate, stop necro-ing old posts with shit Anet said flat out will NEVER happen. [Nope. Not happening.](http://dulfy.net/2016/11/18/gw2-arenanet-on-raid-accessibility-and-tiers/) 
---
Totally agree, I hate seeing people turn on one another when they don't know for sure if it is Intentionally done. I will say that since release I have never accidentally triggered the bug but I still give them the benefit of the doubt. 
---
The problem with the glitch for me is how disorienting it is in a fight and occasionally my big doubles when it's going on. I'm fortunate that my fps doesn't suffer but I've def heard people having the issue. 
---
I rarely watch the gameplay. I listen to him while playing!
---
I don't doubt that and I appreciate the work they are doing to fix it. The problem is that those who play wvw a lot are stuck with the bug/exploit, which is why disabling the mount in wvw would be the most courteous.
