Yeah sorry not disagreeing with you at all. I more just went on a tangent. The correlation that I didn't explain at all is that some of those mechanics are also very pass/fail rather than a ramp (in other words a range of success that is obviously influenced by a player's actions).
---

---
What I'm getting at is the game is often so pass/fail that I think it discourages examining individual contribution. Am I making any more sense putting it like that?
---
---
---
2d side scroller phone app...gw3!
---
You also said you won't have permafury and you're unlikely to overcap.
---
I'd also like them to add some sort of "auto-loot" mastery for those essences. I don't find gathering them 1 by 1 very fun tbh.
---
If you play the meta it's very easy to get enough of at least one type depending on which shrine you're defending during the mandatory time gate.
---
i saw rarely till never full guild raid from any of these servers. they tend to be parts of their respective servers' blobs, but well. especially KILL is a pretty new one (far shiverpeaks currently i think?), mainly running around rather in roamerpacks not amongst the most dangerous ones.
---
Honestly I just want less aftercast on the skill, and maybe no rooting players. At the very least, less aftercast.
---
I think he means [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/WMYwcWZ.png) if anyone else was confused... and as far as I'm aware, no.
---
Thats lame that you we're downvoted but realistically it seems like this is the only way we're ever going to see new hair styles again.
---
gotta bring it up again here: You could also update the Celestial infusions to the resolution that the (dyeable!) gemstore outfit has.   
---
C'mon Anet, please give us some cool non-gemstore stuff. That could really have a positive effect on the communitys mood IMO
---
"Have you ever seen a grown man naked?"
---
Agreed. They also seem to have a fairly short time window on how long you have to pick them up. I've had times when I've aggro'd a medium sized mob and noticed essenences on the ground as enemies started dropping, but didnt pick them up, and by the time I've finished off the last enemy, most of the essences have dissapeared without me gathering them.
---
I would assume the answer would be a no unless you, yourself, could go into the coding and change it to do so
---
It took me ~80g and a week to get collections/farm map currencies for about 3h per day playtime. Gold went to lamp and skyscale food
---
&gt; Like how you pull random numbers like you know how much people play this game, use reddit / or not or have bought skin, have like it or not.
---
I never pulled random numbers, but it's okay if you don't understand things. 
---
&gt; Like i sad before I dont care about 500 gems it is not a q_q post. It a bad design. Also you hold to that thinking, (use the preview) what if people preview it with (example Sword/Torch)?
---
And still you whine about exactly this the whole time. Even now. ;)
---
&gt; How about fixing for once instead of hiding?
---
Learn to read... I said something about clipping several times. I won't repeat it again, but the picture I posted, with exactly the same bug in WoW (you know, your "better solution") is a big hint.
---
Have you tried falling down the hole?
---
condolences on the guy in chat's dog.
---
So potential of tiered rewards or something? They have a system like that for raids where you get like little consolation prizes (Magnetite Shards and such) for getting to checkpoints during the raid. Though I think the (potential) rewards for metas and the like would have to be boosted at a baseline to do similar things there if the chance of failing them is going to keep climbing, otherwise people just won't do them
---
That will always be an issue. Volunteering as Healer Scourge on this boss taught me that it does not matter how many heals and barriers you throw around, if a pug decides he is going to die by standing in three circle aoes at once and not moving..nothing can save him.
---
Just stings that these are the same people who are always complaining about not getting any heals &gt;_&lt;
---
&gt; in my pugs 
---
...
---
&gt;Good DPS
---
[lol](https://media.tenor.com/images/fca1069c7c0bce7b981e3d8066558d6b/tenor.gif)
---
I hope Anet adds more tiers to Essence Manipulation.
---
Somethings like:
---
*  Ricochet to nearby enemies.
---
* Gain temporary stats based on killed enemies (Fallen/Aberrant/Svanir).
---
the buffs are kind of irrelevant. It's really only a useful mastery because it opens chests, which is just a passive feature of it. Stupid mastery. Not a fan.
---
Added today!
---
That would be very cool, potentially saving loading time!
---
For sure man. One sided? Look at my past posts and you'll see what I wrote. It's a mixed bag of nutz. Some shit, some gems, some mehs, some trolls, some whatever's, some frack this guy etc. But it's most of the time constructive to some degree. 
---
We've all be lurking in the web for years and know how it is. You're not some lone vet that suffered. We all feel that flow but we just handle it different ways. 
---
Some break, some bend, some go with the flow, some bounce and some stay salty. Generalizing but you get the picture. 
---
No one is trying to act cool. We all play Guild Wars... Brother, we're all nerds here. I don't think I'm better than you and don't think your better than me. We are just different. Equal bags of shit floating in the universe together. Typing some dumb shit on some random nerdy ass sub.
---
There will be a third tier of each in episode 2.
---
I don't have friends in game ðŸ™ƒ
---
I mean, if you're doing something before the meta and you have a partial stack, by the time you finish the meta, you'll have to sprint to the right chest to unlock it before that buff wears off... doesn't matter if you're dedicated to getting a full stack on all three or just trying to keep all 3 up to a decent level just for the chests at the end of the meta... because you were doing something and had a partial stack of one color, that one color is GOING to run out inconveniently faster than the other two.
---
I literally canâ€™t with this. Too perfect. ðŸ¤£
---
Thats the worst way to enjoy levelling, it makes it so grindy, forced and repetitive. Just go around in zones of your level/slightly above if youre comfortable and do events and kill mobs. 
---
You can 100% once youre satisfied with  your character and build.
---
i still don't know why anet is avoiding difficulty settings like the pest, even just with a regular easy and cm mode would help a lot to make this content more interesting for both ends of the playerbase...
---
The textures I mentioned are for the character's body, essentially "the scalp", not the hair model. So unless the entire character was flipped, which would cause other problems, the character's skin texture would need editing.
---
I'm super happy with my purchase. Why would people not like it?
---
I take the view that everyone in game is my friend.
---
Can confirm it's awesome
---
you do realize you don't need any stacks to open the chests, right?
---
Revenants have no reflects. They do, however, have the best projectile destruction in the game.
---
Champs already drop 9+ btw
---
Also fun in general trying to hover over tiny icons on your bar to read a tooltip in a desperate attempt to understand what's killing you (and then you die because you were trying to read rather than watching mechanics, and the tooltip goes away).
---
Yeah, you can use the special action on the wisps. Primary (only?) cause of seeing the laser button while boss's breakbar isn't up.
---
They're welcome for me helping them achieve their goals.
---
Scissor paper rock balancing is terrible to begin with.  It completely ruined The secret world.  Bad then bad now.
---
The treasure hunter achievement is like 10AP for well over 1,000 gold.  So it's a toss up which do you value more, 10AP or a heck of a lot of money? The home instance chest you get is practically worthless, so you're only doing it for 10AP really.
---
Which glyphs are good for making gold with unlimited tools? I see leatherworking and volatile magic cost high but dunno why.
---
Is it pug-il-ist or pew-jil-ist?
---
I could not agree more. 
---
Another peeve I have with this is the collection. Kill something and you should auto loot the essence instead of having to dance through all the little circles on the ground. 
---
It feels kind of as if there was not much thought put into the practicality of the use of the system

[&amp;DQg1OTIlIjXBEpsADxNvAb0B+gDkAHYAAxOSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]
---
So, this build is based very heavily off runes of the ice and sigils of hydromancy. The "quirk" of this build is extremely high chill uptime, which works fantastically well with reaper's natural 15% damage increase on chilled foes. While keeping chill uptime high on regular power builds is easy, this build is damn near permanent chill uptime even when solo. The runes of ice make the reaper elite shout quite interesting to use, as well, as it basically makes it a double ice explosion. The sigils of hydromancy do some crazy cool stuff on reaper. They proc when entering/exiting shroud, along with swapping weapons, so as such they're on both sets. This, paired with spiteful spirit, makes entering shroud alone enough to kill most tiny trash mobs. I went with the reaper shout heal skill for this build, as its 20 second cooldown, in some ways, makes it better over time in value than consume conditions, though consume conditions is a good choice too.
---
In terms of gear, I decided to go for a mix of assassin's and marauder, with zerker trinkets. This gets base crit to about 60%. With fury outside of shroud, this is brought up to 80% crit chance, which is generally more than enough for open world to nearly always be critting. In shroud, this puts you at 93% base with Deaths perception and no fury. Of course, there's not really any fury output, but overall its not much of a problem. If you really want to always crit cap yourself, you can change soul eater in the reaper line to decimate defences. Vuln uptime is great as usual on reaper so its a decent value skill, I just personally prefer soul eater. Also, due to the chill uptime, its perfectly reasonable to take bitter chill in the spite line.
---
Overall, the chill uptime makes most mobs encountered in open world slow as shit, and allows a solo reaper to really do great, and the constance ice explosions just feel great (I value fun over efficiency in most cases). With camera shake on, if you enioy that kind of thing, its a blast. If you dont mind increased shout cooldowns, and want even more ice explosions, you can take Chilling Nova. 
---
In its own way, this is an incredibly great build in my experience. Its glassy, but the Marauder's gear makes it nice and comfortable most of the time, and reaper's natural tankiness generally makes the glassyness a non issue, especially if you dodge right. The flat damage increases obtained on this build generally make most mobs melt in seconds, as well, so its quite safe. And, I went ahead and gave it a try in pvp just for the hell of it and I dont think anybody really expects all the chill. Won a few rounds, but Im relatively low tier so take from that what you will.
---
If you're going to replace a skill, Id replace the minions. I actually use spectral pull over the minions which I find much better, but the minions might ease some pressure off newer necro users.
---
Volatile is highest overall due to shipments like [Trophy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment), you can see [shipment prices here](http://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html).
---
This is the way.
---
I have spoken.
---
Clayton did mention in one of the guild chats that they might be sneaking in new assets in the coming weeks (after the zone released).
---
But you're probably right about this one, as I feel like they wouldn't just sneak in one sculpture. I haven't noticed other changes.
---
&gt;But what if Arena Net's idea for a Guild Wars 3, was another genre swap like in the above two examples?
---
There's been already a genre shift in GW2, from MMO to single player walking sim. The only logical step for GW3 would be an interactive movie. 
---
Beyond: Two Taimis
---
[removed]
---
Its a lot of work commanding or even leading guilds.  Not enough people get credit for it.  I'm glad Anet recognized this and gave them the extra pip gain in WvW.
---
I ran a large guild and it just got to be too much work.  Scheduling events, managing active players, dealing with drama, coming up with ways to be different than other guilds, chatting and being active in guild chat, setting up websites and discords, and so much more.  Its a lot but its worth it when you see how happy you make people feel, sadly though, it eventually gets to be too much for a lot of people.
---
His seem to be the most prevelant, and while it's sometimes messy to have to deal with criticism, he has been doing an excellent job and should be commended for it.
---
Praise Joko for them.
---
&gt;What are your story predictions for Icebrood Saga? [serious]
---
* Jormag is not The Whisperer.
---
* Braham will fall to The Whisperer because all he has left in the world is the Commander and the Commander's only skill is breaking things. His breaking point will come when Taimi dies.
---
* Taimi dies.
---
* Either Rytlock or Crecia die saving Ryland so he can learn the error of his ways.
---
* We'll get Braham back at the same time. Probably immediately followed by him sacrificing himself for some reason. 
---
* Aurene starts to show that while she is The Good Elder Dragon she is still an Elder Dragon and not to be crossed. This has the effect of making the already suspicious and fearful even more so.
---
* Efram becomes Kahn-Ur because of this.
---
* Jory finally gives up on her hard-boiled persona, stops suppressing everything, and her and Kas go off to enjoy domesticity like Rox did.
---
* Due to the high price of victory The Commander throws their costume into the trash at the end of the saga and vows to be The Commander no more! 
---
* A skritt finds their gear, puts it on, *Guild Wars 3: The Return of the Shiny* is announced
---
To those heroes that stand around at hard to reach mastery points for hours offering a free teleport to friend: Thank you so much
---
Bonus, stop locking mastery attack against only "some" enemies. It's just stupid. You've finally collected all the orbs, it's _finally_ showing you special action key.
---
Nope. _This_ enemy is not _the right_ kind of enemy. Chose again. Nope, not that one either. I can't find and target shit in this visual bukkake. Just let me blast the damn thing and forget about the whole rock-paper-scissors-annoyance game.
---
Guilds disappear/xfer off slowly NA be dead for ages OCX/SEA alive until Cookie left no link stale mu zero support from anet generally speaking yet when they do make 'changes'... terrible. Players even left when warclaw came out last straw. Peeps on break for pve, halloween etc. I'm not american idk what holidays are around now but ppl took time off for rl stuff too? No way to recruit new blood onto server to replace guilds + vets leaving when said server is permanently closed (and why would they when everyone + their mother would bandwagon as soon as it opens..) gg.
---
The Necro team wins! And the crowd goes wild!
---
Is that supposed to be strange somehow?
---
But did you win?
---
Maybe full refresh with each kill
---
Especially that one Mesmer with bunny ears and pink dress what is on every daily jp:-D
---
Unless you are a game dev, you can not claim that. Because you don't know if their programing tools have the feature.
---
This is a testament to how poorly thought out this system is.  You don't need to be attuned to a colour to open a chest.  You just need T1 or T2 mastery of the colour that the chest is weak to.
---
I think this misunderstanding arises from not paying sufficient attention to the tutorial that has you getting attuned to a colour and immediately getting you to open a chest
---
Yeah, the beetle is great if you don't have the elevation to jump off of for the griffon but the beetle has the disadvantage to get stuck when you hit small objects which will reduce the speed.
---
That is really why I said you actually want all of them because every mount has its pros and cons.
---
Love it.
---
Clayton's been great. He's always positive and passionate about stuff in guild chats and here. He comments here out of work hours, on both positive and negative feedback pretty often.
---
I kind of like the mechanic, the first time I enter the map. I donâ€™t find it too tedious. But youâ€™re right, once is enough. I find my play sessions on the map are only really half an hour to 45 minutes now tops anyway, and Iâ€™m certainly not going to hang around just for the sake of re-buffing. If anything, the buffs falling off encourage me to leave.
---
electro blue and purple work for me
---
Sneaky dialogue and asset changes for players to find between episodes were confirmed, I think.
---
Well you should. Putting aside the massive damage you do because some professions can easily do the same amount of dps its main real use is to break bar on champion enemies. For example the boneskinner event always fails when almost nobody uses essence burst because its basically the only way to break his bar fast enough.
---
Clayton's single-handedly dealing with the aftermath of YEARS of fuckups, ignorance and blatant disregard ANet has shown towards community.
---
I think Braham is more likely because Rytlock seems to be Anets main Destiny's Edge character he has been with us since HoT. Jory could be in trouble as well. To be honest I think any of the Dragon's Watch characters could die or become corrupted but Braham is my number one pick.
---
The only dream about gw2 I had was night before HoT launch. I dreamt that HoT was this big, massive expansion with a lot of maps, not only in Maguuma Jungle, but also in Maguuma Wastes. What a stupid dream it was.
---
It's just a reference to a "fight" thats close to me since I did high end clears and speed runs from the start of the game and soon enough the topic of casusal vs hardcore barged in.

Endgame PvE is now abandoned content. Anet dropped dungeons and seemingly fractals too recently.

Melody stopped tagging up since no players at his timezone. 15-20 people tops vs a fat 30 sos blob + 20 sos blob makes the fights difficult so his given up.

Once again **I HAVEN'T EXPLOITED ANYTHING.** "  NEVER accepted any rewards as the chest got auto-opened from my daily chest spam after winning a PvP daily " as stated in the post. What mistakes/punishment are you talking about? Very curious about that
---
My dailies are almost always unaffected by them. I always combine pve and wvw dailys, the easiest ones. Usually I find 3 really easy soloable ones.
---
 \#FreeFlandre
---
Selective rule enforcement = "drama". OK
---
Yeah, I saw him on the first day. A ghostly giant led me to him.
---
Yes, there is a bit more endgame now. We have 7 raid wings (resetting weekly), there were added new Fractals and Fractal challenge modes (giving you extra loot every day).
---
Probably the whole stuff from HoT with gliding and PoF with mounts will keep you busy. There are  also new maps and every 3 month another.
---
There are lots of new legendarys, even Trinkets.
---
So you will have to do a lot of things until you can start endgame again. I also would recommend to join a guild if you want to do CM fractals and raids. Cause starting these will be really hard if you have no company.
---
As warrior you will also be able to do everything. You will may just need several builds, but warrior is still meta in fractals and at nearly every raid boss. At least as banner and cc slave.
---
But I guess as soon as you get deeper into raids/fractals, you will probably learn other  classes and builds that fit you.
---
I want to come and say No! You are wrong! But I can't. They will probably release a fractal somewhere around episode 3 or 4 to keep the dream alive. After that.. gg.
---
Im pretty sure the Fallen portal event has a different timing to it. When I went for the achievement with my squad we had to grind the few regular Fallen enemies that are there without the event while the pre-event of the Boneskinner was active
---
Could not care less about the OP.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1112872#Comment_1112872
---
it is not about group size to be honest. its about having voice communication. more and more people refuse to go voice chat because commanders being toxic and abusing their power to kick anyone who don't "fit" aoe groups. which leads into people dropping playing wvw.
---
this is why small groups are so fun. everyone on voice, communication not issue. even if you lose you know you had a good fight.
---
Even if you did not exploit anything, why do you believe what mighty teapots says? Is he a gw2 gm? Could be that you got this punishment because of something else?
---
Those are MY tears...
---
I've heard a lot of terrible things about Flandre. Besides being extremely toxic and generally a super shitty person, they also wintraded numerous times. 
---
Also crazy things of them lying to Sinderer that they were a girl, and using a fake female voice for over 2 years just to get on his monthly team. 
---
I've heard literally only negative things for good person also saying they're a consistent.
---
I would trait this post with a very heavy dose of salt. Please leave the scene permanently.
---
Your welcome my friends.

Just equip the lifesteal trait. Inbetween attacking the boss or wisps you should have no issues keeping yourself alive

Wonder what that scumbag history is, mind bring it up to light? When did you "play competitively"? Can't recall that one

And conspiring with otheres to get someone unfairly banned is what i said it is

Good PR response tho, enjoyed it bro.

I don't think Taimi will die just to keep Debi Derryberry as a voice actress but seriously I know this story is going to be dark but I think they'll draw the line at child deaths.

---
THIS!!
---
YES!! The PINK mesmers are absolute legends! Huge thanks to them!!
---
 Hey everyone,
---
I started playing gw2 in 2012 a couple months after launch. I leveled a ranger to max and was rather lost in all the content.
---
Almost 2 years ago (i think) I bought PoF and HoT. For some reason i got a free level 80 and picked warrior because everybody said it was easy to get into groups. I found it very boring. I quit the game because my computer at the time could barely run it and would freeze often.
---
I'm looking to get back into the game now and start with a clean slate. I would like to play a **necromancer** because I like the idea behind them but people tell me they are not quite viable in group pve content. Is this true?
---
Also, do you think there would be **guilds** welcoming a noob player like me or am I to late for the party? I'm not interested in pvp. I just want a casual level experience and group content at endgame.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
what rank is this?
---
and the Shadow Portal Thieves. Rare but they exist too.
---
Also can you please separate the skills HUD and the mastery xp bar. That yellow color gives me a headache.
---
People that get ban on pvp are always crying i've no exploit i've not cheating in the end if they been banned they are always reason behind it, 
---
Get your shit together kid and move on its just a game
---
The interview gave no dev names, it was a thing of â€œhe said that they saidâ€œ. But I like to believe that if what was said was wrong Anet had officially corrected them, so for me raids and fractals are done. Not saying anything is equal to saying no without making people said so they can â€œkeep on hopingâ€œ, as one of our story writers said.

:)
---
&gt; **but I NEVER accepted any rewards** 
---
from your post. i took it as you not wanting or caring about the rewards so you didn't manually accept them, but were still given them by the system as you said.
---
no matter the case, the rewards were issued to your account
---
Well that might partly be because of the sad part that no-one really does this event because it's not like it leads to any fancy rewards or anything
---
Those skins are expensive though! Definetly worth doing.
---
But you robbed others from said reward. It might not be for personal gain, but you took something that others could have had.
---
Compared to year 1 (when I also left for a while) there is a vast amount of PvE content. Additionally to what others have said, thereâ€™s also strike missions, many many living story maps to explore and farm for gear, trinkets, etc. Tons of collections with rewards , side stories, mounts, bounty runs, strike missions, gardens for your home instance that work with ascended cooking, etc.
---
My main focus was to keep the torches alit I was assigned to, including killing wisps that are around there. Of course that's going to lead to less damage, but it's not like I wasn't trying to do damage, that's just absurd.
---
I never took anything from anyone. I wont his monhtly fair and square just like i always do go watch a stream vod
---
how are those FALSE accusations relevant at all?
---
They do need to improve this a bit. They should be faster to charge, and last longer. I would say 1. Double the orb drop rate (and make them drop more frequently on "bigger" targets), 2.  increase the duration to 30 minutes, and 3. have each orb picked up reset the duration to 30 minutes.
---
Keep trying ;)
---
Have you seen the leaving with your own eyes?
---
Always nice to see peeps from your own server, keep gankin them!.
---
I had  IClownI or whatever stupid name he goes by now tell me to "Go kys you (n-word)(homophobic slur)" in a game once because I told him it's not OUR fault he died 1v1 far.. Never got a ban from what I can tell.
---
BG hasn't gotten a link in the past two relinks so a lot of the PPT guilds have transferred out.
---
Love the communication from the dev team. Hope they keep at it.

Dude scared me a bit. Wish I could do something for him.

Are they false? Can you prove them wrong other than putting your word to it?
---
Read rule number 3 of this subreddit

&gt; This could literally not be more inaccurate.

ironic, isn't it.

I've seen an old useless NPC that claims to be a god saying they left
---
only responding to false accusations spread by brigaders ( as seen in the post) aimed at derailing the point of my post
---
Yeah got into a pug with 2 healers and an alacrigade we just stacked tightly and dodge rolled his jump attack, went pretty smoother.
---
I don't think you could heal through that pressure with 1 healer though.

---
First time I saw them was last Friday at least. And I don't see why it couldn't be something that's slowly getting put in, the Silverwastes had something similar going on between its first release and its last release, the vines that disappear after killing the underground bosses (and reappear after the meta resets)
---
You admitted to account sharing and wintrading for KRUPEK in your own video in front of everyone. And you still wonder why you're banned? You must be as special as he is.
---
That is good, I have spoken

It seems quite similar to the vines in the Silverwastes that disappear after killing the underground bosses (and reappear after the meta resets), those also didn't exist at the first release of the Silverwastes and slowly sprouted in real time. I was one of two people that managed to get one of them sprouting on video at the time
---
Hmm. Now the smart thing to do would be to hold/pull back (before even more people are turned) and try and find a way to figure out how Jormag's manipulation works and how it can be stopped. Then you can even try things like  turn captured Svanir or something.
---
But, hey, that's probably not going to happen. Rytlock either gets us into trouble or he gets into trouble without us (I'd expect the latter, he'll probably be with Crecia). We venture further into the north, encountering more of Jormag's atrocities and remnants of Norn society and the spirits. I think Jhavi will heroically sacrifice herself at some point.
---
I found it better to rotate around the three camps, each raven shrine thing has a different type attacking it. If you kill a few, help take down a bomber or two, gather some essence then rotate around to the next one and keep doing that for a few minutes, you can get all three stacked to 30 pretty easily. Not that it actually helps, but it's better than just playing it the way it was probably intended where you just stand in one spot pressing one for 15 minutes on HP bags that don't give any experience or loot.
---
It's hard to get good info from the Mists.
---
Trivial lore question:
---
When we pay for Waypoint teleport, we pay a fee. To whom does that fee go? Is there a company that maintains Waypoints? If waypoint travel inside a city is free, does that mean that the city itself is paying for it instead of us?
---
I believe Wooden Potatoes does some lore videos on YouTube.
---
Most of what I know I've read on the wiki. Both GW2's and GW's. 
---
There are the novels too, I think they are three.
---
&gt;give the Boss immunity until the torches are lit again
---
Since boss and adds attack them all the time, there should be some iCD on this immunity buff. Otherwise he will just phase in and out of invulnerability constanty.
---
That's so unecessary...
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; A better option would be that players act like human beings once in a while. But "ignore their bullshit" and "don't interact in the first place" do seem to be the only other options at this point in history.
---
Welcome to the Internet, that's how things have worked since the very beginning.
---
Rule #1 of the Internet: Don't feed the trolls.
---
Wiki "The movement of the world" it is a quick primer. Then go deeper.
---
I agree with you damage buffs never help as it just teaches players to go more heals or tank up. 
---
Your solution with the torches sounds so much better.
---
Exactly, we need more like him.
---
I disagree. This is supposed to be a stepping stone, it's supposed to push you into more than just "Do mechanics" and a full dps squad to burn down the boss. Tou should be thinking of compositions, figuring out what works best for you, adding in healers needed as well because they need practice and you should be adding them. This boss is great imho because a much more exp group that's optimized can stack and burn and skip mechanics just like a few raid bosses. It not only pushes your worse players into doing mechanics but it punishes them quite heavily for not paying attention instead of hand holding and giving them rewards for being lazy. Put the pressure on them and see how they adjust, if they cant handle it or dont like the harder mechanics they sure as hell won't like raids.
---
*Cries in wasted potential.*
---
yeah, that mechanics might require a longer phase of the torches being lit.
---
Alternatively adds could spawn in an increased rate the more torches go out.
---
&gt; Melody stopped tagging up since no players at his timezone. 
---
What time zone is that?  I swear I seen him during OCX back when bg was t1..
---
Honestly, I currently don't like it at all, but only for one reason. Hiding parts of the UI severely limits its functionality. There should be a transparency and mouseover option instead of the simple on/off toggle.
---
Which is how absolutely every sale works, its not just anet being bad guys, it's just psychology unfortunately
---
Also add option to hide  Loot (scrolls from top to bottom on the right). This is problem for my pc when i want open xXx champions bags or gear and salvage.
---
OP deleted his post?  Or his entire reddit?
---
Just because capitalism is fucked doesn't mean you lay down and take it. Yes, we're aware what a sale is. Still manipulative. 
---
Your ItS nOt JuSt AnEt l! OTheR cOmpaNIs dO IT tOo! contributes nothing.
---
Some people like ERP...or so I was told...by a friend...
---
could we also have separate windows for dailies and pinned achievements?
---
Yes. I am terrible at jumping puzzles. Mesmers are the only reason I get any puzzles done. Thank you!
---
&gt;the krews that are running and maintaining the Waypoints and Asura Gates.
---
This is going to sound like an odd question, but do the waypoints "exist" in lore terms, or are they purely a gameplay conceit?
---
I ask because I can't remember a character ever referring to them in speech, or in a lore-conveying manner (like a cutscene), but they mention gates all the time (and the Gate Network persists from GW1, where it was also a lore element).
---
I always wondered if the waypoints were a late addition to the game in development. This is because there's a feature in-game where, when it's directing you to your next mission, it'll actually *route you through gates* if the route is shorter; this is an interesting feature which presumably was created for a reason - but as waypoints exist, that reason largely doesn't exist.
---
Norn cultural armor IIRC
---
That's a flaw in the design.
---
You don't fix the flaw with more designs that allow the flaw to work, you fix it with designs that avoid the flaw.
---
I assume it's to prevent the narrative dissonance of vanilla GW2's dungeons, where the DE characters would travel around the dungeons with you, but spend 90% of the time on the floor needing to be revived.
---
The story bigged them up as these amazing heroes, but they were useless in-game.
---
Melody and beng are located in Singapore area so their timezone is usually SEA.
---
What they should do to discoruage stacking heals is changing how poison works:
---
* Rather than increasing the damage with each stack, decrease the healing with each stack. Something like -5% healing per stack, and capping it at 20 stacks on players. At 20 stacks, players get 0% healing and can't be healed by any source. 
---
* On enemies they won't cap, and any stack past 20, adding -0.5% healing per extra stack past 20, meaning healing will damage the NPC instead.
---
Then flood the area with poison unless the mechanics are done, and there you go, healing will be pointless if the mechanics are ignored.
---
Ah, shame, it's heavy. I was hoping it'd be medium.
---
Ability to hide xp drops please?
---
Especially when you are at max level, they are just extra clutter on your screen.
---
And that one beach in Southsun Cove.
---
And the changing tent in Labyrinthine Cliffs. 
---
Unless they add way more things that put players in 'swimwear mode' customizing or dying underwear would be pretty pointless except for RP.
---
Ah boo, that sucks.
---
it's particularly scummy for digital sales bc there's no merchandise to physically move, no (or at least farrrr less)extra employees needed like cashiers returns etc.
---
The problem with that is that poison is also used in other gamemodes. this mechanic would be horrendous in spvp.
---
The idea itself is good, but maybe make it an instance specific debuff only for this Strike.
---
Well, I've just joined a group with 3 (or even 4) healers and it went smooth, we stacked and ignored the torches. Splitting is too punishing in this encounter beacause there are no player-targeted heals like in WoW.
---
Only because poison is so spammable.
---
To be usable in competitive modes in that form, poison just needs to be more in check and less spammable, replacing many of its sources with bleeding or torment.
---
You weren't pressing your skills while on the boss
---
After you finish the Bad Blood story step, it would start snowing in left half of Grothmar Valley. If that changed with EP1 I don't know.
---
I miss doing that meta train with you guys, it gave me something to do in the evenings.
---
Yes Waypoints exist in Lore. Season 2 actual deals with an issue and fixing the Waypoint System.
---
It's not I don't care it's how you phrase your complaints. Do you praise capitalism when Anet does something you like? If you like capes being introduced do you start thank capitalism and Adam Smith?
---
I know you love your prejudice and all but currently we're heavily outnumbered SEA time. IF you ever pop on BG on a SEA/OCX night we're heavily outnumbered and often double teamed. Last week and today SoS and Mag had 2 groups vsing our tiny 25 man group. They refused to do open field fights as well so overall WvW ends up running around smc trying to fight our way in as we're heavily outnumbered. They're nights where nobody tags up and we just have 5-10 people spread out across all maps tops as we try to defend keeps from 20-60 man blobs.
---
You might be surprised, but there's rumours that not every single player is online every single day, or even every third day.
---
ANet loses quite some money with this kind of sales, but hey, they are the experts.
---
we gona boom and bam every boss and then we gona kill jormag,the end.
---
Now is one of the best times to get into raids. [Raid Academy](http://discord.gg/gw2ra), the prime NA Raid Training discord, is hosting its [Zero to Hero event](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e3il3l/gw2_raid_academy_na_zero_to_hero_community_raid/) where all players of any skill level (and even any build/equipment) are welcome to come learn how raids work in a safe judgment-free environment!
---
Iâ€™m well aware of how ArcDPS worked and while it had unlimited use, the official templates are a vast improvement in QoL for anyone with legendary gear it was pretty much garbage prior to build templates (but really theyâ€™re loadouts)
---
It's nice to see more options but the choice in combat/out of combat is too limited. How about no party panel when not in a party? How about no XP bar? How about separate story/achievements/mission options? With the current options, I just feel most people will just show everything all the time like it was before, there is stuff you just can't afford to not see.
---
Not sure if you have been paying attention, but they made changes to the boneskinner strike mission based on feedback here. That's what I'm asking them to do more often.
---
Wait for swimsuits, I'm pretty sure they will get to replace the underwear sooner or later.
---
If I was on the other team I would have been giddy, and switched to zerker soulbest, or deadeye.
---
You can use the show Ally key to have it pop back up while you hold it. Which I guess is similar enough and probably easier to implement than a mouseover option.
---
So like how every other server has been? Always a great time going against a 50 person organized blob when your link can only gather 10. Itâ€™s been like this on every server I have played. 24/7 PPT coverage doesnâ€™t happen. 
---
BG was the 50 person blob 24/7 PPT. Now all these threads complaining you are outnumbered, when thatâ€™s just a normal thing for every server. Welcome to how all the other servers feel.
---
There's nothing behind the door, it's just a decoration.
---
DH is top power dps and FB is top condi dps, on top of that quickness fb is meta for fractals, minstrel fb is meta for wvw and hybrid fb (support/dmg) is probably the best carry in lower tier ranks in pvp. You cant really go wrong with guardian.
---
There's hundreds of those across the world, few of them per map, all working as intended, so yeah, it would be a pity if they didn't get used and went unnoticed :I.
---
Definitely a step in the right direction but its so incredibly small.  We can't forget all the other areas they neglect just because one boss in one strike mission was balanced.  There are still bugs in the game from launch, rampant botting, neglect across entire game modes, etc.  Things gotta improve and while its good to acknowledge the good outcomes, we can't let it overshadow all the bad ones.
---
ITT: armchair economists duke it out
---
On topic- it would be nice for people who can't login every single day
---
Yeah I feel this especially with the politics, drama, and organization skills. It's honestly something a person can put on their resume because of the work involved in doing so (provided it's worded correctly and that they're applying to the right job).
---
TL note: We don't give a flying fuck if it doesn't concern gem store.
---
Except our issue is it's constant outnumbered. Bgs not 24/7 ppt most our points come from fights now. The ones we win 30 v 60.
---
How about a "show all equipped weapons"? I want to see my rifle and my daggers.
---
"Terrible things lurk just beyond the horizon" is what is bothering me, what was Jormag referring to? Could Steve really appear this season?
---
You're not wrong at all. I just want to encourage more of this behavior. If this had been the norm for the past few years I believe that the game would be much better for it.
---
I've already led five training runs as part of this event and trust me when I say: If you've never set foot in a raid (or even endgame content as a whole) before, you're in for a great time here. Come give it a shot!
---
While I would most certainly like this option (because I sure as hell ain't ever completing any story on 20+ alts and ain't a fan of constantly seeing tracked achievements), I'm afraid that the solution they came up with for Dynamic HUD currently simply removes the whole block from existence and doesn't change how each block is structured inside itself. That said, they did have options that deal directly with removing parts of that specific block, so they really should go look into those again and let us remove the story/achievements section altogether separately from Dynamic HUD.
---
Really odd how devs stopped hanging out here.
---
100%. I wish it was back to pre-HoT levels of communication at least.  It really dropped off when Colin went to Amazon.
---
is that a.. poogle?! [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DanODTPUQAA9Tg\_.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DanODTPUQAA9Tg_.jpg)
---
This is pretty much exactly how I feel, and why I made the post - the buff ending definitely makes me feel like going somewhere else instead of spending 10 minutes farming one type of enemy for 15 more minutes of a slight buff against a different type of enemy.
---
Core and DH power dps are nuts and confi dps and quickness are nuts. and if you wanna heal or tank,, also pretty good
---
This is the smaller scale side of what they meant about potentially not putting in a map every story update. Having the resources to touch-up or expand on existing content.
---
I am curious when we will have such an episode, one without a new map, and the weight of the content they add to existing maps and whether that'll be worth it. 
---
Expanded areas like in Dry Top would be so dope, I loved that style of content - I remember pointing out a "mysterious centaur" to a friend, it was watching the main play area from an unreachable cliff.
---
Hi all,
---
Iâ€™ve been playing gw2 on a complete junker and want to upgrade, but Iâ€™m completely ignorant when it comes to PCâ€™s and their specs. 
---
Iâ€™ve read some recommendations on this subreddit and started looking at some deals available and found the following pc: [PC](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iBUYPOWER-WA563GT3-Gaming-Desktop-PC-Ryzen-3-3200G-8GB-DDR4-2666Memory-NVIDIA-GeForce-GT-1030-1TB-HDD-Wi-Fi-RGB-Windows-10-Home-64-Bit/274098611) 
---
Would anyone know if this would be an appropriately powerful PC for gw2? And is this a good price for it?
---
Thank you!
---
That's why anet should keep making hard content no matter how many people criticize. People like that usually only learn when they have no other option (or they just give up, but in that case, it's for the better).
---
It's about time this game has some balance. Various difficulties of content should always be released: easy, medium and hard.
---
If you can't learn for a reason or other, just avoid the hard. 
---
What can't be done all the time is to keep the game dumbed down to the point there's no challenge for anyone anymore.
---
&gt; And it's not like the gaming industry hasn't resorted to disgusting ways to profit from psychology and addiction but most developers just want to create the best possible experience and have little say when it comes to monetization.
---
'resorted to' implies all kinds of total bullshit.  How about 'gloried in disgusting ways to profit from psychology and addiction'?
---
sometimes i wonder why wont they just do the trick like they did with rox backstory - a cave-in killed all her warband bla bla and we get a fresh start. or we could get destiny's edge back, they weren't as clownish as whatever this is.
---
*clears throat*
---
"I'd pay gems for that!"
---
I could be wrong but you can actually hide loot in the dynamic hud options
---
You're \*still\* drunk from last night???
---
Last fractal was over a year ago at this point, but it's not important imo. There's actually a good amount of fractals and raids at this point. I think the systems in place and content needs work rather then *more* content. 
---
Adding new fractals/raids doesn't magically fix any problems. People are still catching up, 7 raids are a lot, and there's still a lot of community that needs to master and fully complete the current content. Dungeons are acknowledged to be abandoned so idk why anyone still brings that up. 
---
Also that's quite a bit of content if you realize Fractals/Raids are only a forth of the game's content, next to WvW, PvP, and Living World. If anything WvW and PvP are far more neglected then Raids of Fractals.
---
Oh Damn thanks. I'm amazed how I never even noticed it before. Usually I just look at the "Latest news" Part after logging in...
---
&gt;Developer decisions can make or break your ability to enjoy a hobby that you've **invested** time and money into. It is frustrating.
---
Gamers **have** to stop viewing money and time put into MMOs as an investment. That money isnâ€™t being invested in anything. It is a sunken cost. Buying Anet stock would be an example of an investment, playing GW2 for five hours a day and spending hundreds of dollars a month on the gem shop is not an investment. Itâ€™s a sunken cost.
---
Sunken costs on things you enjoy are acceptable if you can live with it, if you enjoy it. If you feel like youâ€™re throwing money away on a game, then you need to stop and thatâ€™s on you, not on Anet. That time and money though is **not** and investment. You may feel invested because you spend a lot of your time and money on it, but it has no value outside of personal enjoyment.
---
If you spent time on a hobby that produces a tangible good like furniture, that would be an investment of your time. If you spent your money on a substance that only builds value over time, like gold, that would be an investment of your money. Having an extensive digital video game collection on the ps3 where you donâ€™t own any disks though, thatâ€™s an example of something that isnâ€™t an investment, that isnâ€™t actually worth anything to anybody but you, and if you move on to a next gen console and forget about your ps3, itâ€™s essentially money down the drain. Thatâ€™s totally okay if you enjoyed it while you had it and you could let it go, but if you feel like the fact that itâ€™s worth nothing is a problem, then you probably shouldnâ€™t have bought all those games.
---
well, Jormag is known for being to Primordus' magic, and vice-versa, so it's not that farfetched ?
---
Primordus, not Steve. It also doesn't fear Primordus, they're just polar opposites.
---
Hi, all kinds of guilds including RP guilds usually advertise on r/guildrecruitment .

Yes, let's keep arguing about the design of [something you don't even play by your own admission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aus65j/more_raid_devs_leaving_the_company/ehb0vm7/). You surely know more about the successes and failures of raid design, than someone who's been raiding since the day they came out in 2015.
---
1. Yes, both as power dps, condi DPS, and support (power dragonhunter, condi firebrand, support/heal firebrand.
---
2. Yes, power Soulbeast is a very solid power dps build. Condi Soulbeast is also an option for raids that favour condi specs.
---
3. Probably the only build that can do well on both condi and power scenarios is the condi firebrand. But generally you want to have a power dps build and a condi DPS build.
---
Glad someone bring this up.
---
Today I literally played 3 hours straight in maybe 15+ different public groups trying to kill new Boneskinner. Every group seems to die to the instance-wide aura damage, which is 2,7k every 3 seconds.
---
Most groups went directly under Boneskinner and got downed in 10-20 seconds. All of them.
---
Best group got Boneskinner to 71%. This group had 3 healers outhealing and ressing everyone, until they got downed too. Ignored all mechanics.
---
Worst group got Boneskinner to 93%. We decided to focus on mechanics instead of DPS, so everyone tried to light fires and kill adds. It was endless running in circles downed-ress-downed-ress-downed-ress-downed-ress-downed... though this group lived longest (gold reward timer was 0:00).
---
Then there is other things. Public players come and leave. There was almost always someone leaving *during* initial vote of "do we have enough players". Also most players leave after first wipe. I always stay in few minutes if a new group joins, but it never seems to happen.
---
Boneskinner went from strike mission to an actual raid.
---
Your biggest problem is that your haven't fully unlocked the Daredevil traitline. You'd be better off playing with three fully unlocked core thief traitlines than playing with a half unlocked daredevil traitline.  
---
In general the importance of things in Guild Wars is Rotaion &gt; Traits &gt;&gt;&gt; Gear.
---
   Your best bet would be joining a hero point run for PoF or HoT maps to fully unlock Daredevil and then you can easily solo any Hero point if you have the right traits selected.
---
Even so, it's not like Z came up with that plan. It all comes up from higher ups. 99% it was Mike O. Now that Mike O is gone, it's probably Z who's letting devs come out of the shadows again. Though I'm not entirely sure if Z took Mike O's spot or if someone else did.
---
Next episode expands Bjora to the west, but the area set aside for that is basically the same size as current Bjora, so it's basically a new map.
---
Better than moot loot
---
Kralk did call out for his mom as we speared him.
---
This post is about strikes. Get over yourself.
---
You can be part of the problem, you can be part of the solution, or you can run away.
---
Your choice, but water won't stop being wet just because you want it to.
---
Phew here too! I liked old version more than new version. So far no-one has been able to kill new version after endless amount of hours and infinite amount of wipes, while old version took only 3 wipes to kill it.
---
Also it'd be nice to see a fix for https://i.imgur.com/Xl7ZNDc.png?2 (same general hair style, different races)

---
The easiest hero points to get are from the pof and hot maps as they give you 10 each time, and even easier still are the "place of power" ones
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Place_of_power
---
Look for ones in crystal desert and heart of maguuma, as long as you have the expansions it's pretty easy to travel to them all
---
Think the only 2 that are a bit hard are "mushroom spore cloud" and "balthazars statue" (unless the areas have been cleared) 
---
There's also "toxin cured hog" which is fairly easy, may take a couple of tries, very easy if you have a friend with the jackal mount that can pounce on you to pull your health up
---
I have plenty of disagreements with the game, but that doesn't mean that I condone toxicity.  I condone respectful, well-thought out and organized criticism that sparks discussion.  Toxicity here is often just empty criticism where people weaponize their frustration and make blunt remarks without any meaningful reasoning.
---
You can swap in and out of elites anytime you want, so if you like doing most stuff in core guardian and then you join a fractal party that needs a healer you can spec into firebrand for that time being.
---
Usually elites offer some advantages, I really like how they mostly add mechanics and make the class more complex, this is what makes me want to play elites more than core. While not usually meta, core builds can work pretty well and nobody will bother you if you're just soloing content.
---
Wish I could tell you more about Dragonhunter and Firebrand playstyle.
---
throwing away a stack or two of each everyday...
---
I genuinely wonder if you can comprehend how strange it looks for people from the outside, that the way people interact with each other on the internet is such an accepted normality. Water wet, indeed.
---
There's people from different countries, languages, and cultures, all stacked in the same place. You know what's strange? Assuming they will all behave like your neighbors next door, just because that's your perceived correct way.
---
For starters, most of your first world etiquette doesn't mean shit to 95% of the world's population, a fact reflected by the general lack of social norms around the web. The Internet is far more closer to the real world than what you perceive to be normality.
---
I have 2 alts literally full of them. I've been crafting the Obsidian Shard refinement recipes for no discernable reason other that it might eventually be useful.
---
If I cold sell them for 1 copper I would gladly.
---
I should get more of the trinkets, to be honest, but I'll still greatly outpace the loss with how many I get.
---
The absolute worst thing, is that I know they're used to create ascended gear, but I get all my stuff through Grandmaster Marks, which don't even need them. If I could swap out the leather for 10K of each, I would, lol.
---
I could write a wall of text about how different elite specs play compared to each other but to be honest, I think the best thing you can do is going into the PvP lobby with your characters and just trying out the different elite specs. In the PvP area everything is instanlty unlocked if you have the required expansions, even your character's level doesn't matter.
---
Check metabattle.com for a variety of different builds for different gamemodes and just pick one that sounds fun to you and go for it. Some skills are balanced differently in PvP and PvE areas but I think it's similar enough for you to just give the builds a try on the training golems in the PvP lobby to get a feel for them.
---
The biggest difference between core guard, Dragonhunter and Firebrand will be your F1, F2 and F3 skills and the weapons you can use (although DH longbow doesn't see much use these days) so make sure to explore those thoroughly.
---
Gee I wonder why developers don't want to post on a board where for the past 3 years "community" has treated them like literal shit and managed to bully many into deleting their reddit accounts altogether.
---
TOP FUCKING KEK /r/selfawarewolves
---
They have a set rotation like blink into vulnerability first into say more extra damage or boons like justice active in DH to maximise DPS output so if they are up against newer players that are caught off guard, he most probably will lose. Bots don't beat human players easily,in hearthstone, bots are capable of achieving legend rank( highest possible)
---
I think the idea of bot maker is that the bot has perfect rotation so it has a higher chance to win fights which is why they write the bot to prioritise killing players first before capping points
---
I have a screenshot of the 4 bots on my team which rotate to a point together in a straight line but did not cap it before doing the same to other empty points. Idk if posting it is allowed since it's naming and shaming
---
Ryland turns to icebrood and kills Bangar to take the helm as the Icebrroods general along with a bunch of corrupted charr.
---
But, as per the commanders training this opens up an opportunity to use the dragon's strength as it's greatest weakness. Ryland is captured by Dragon's Watch giving them a chance to practice this trade.
---
The commander appeals to dignity, the trait they learned most embodies Ryland before he had been turned. Convincing him the dragon's power, is undignified to follow.
---
Rytlock and Cretia appeal to loyalty and order, convincing Ryland that killing Bangar was not the right thing to do. Rytlock, using his encounter with Bangar at Grothmar keep to illustrate his points.
---
Braham and Jhavi appeal to blood/comradery. Jhavi invoking their memories of one of the greatest charr generals of the time, Soulkeeper and the Vigil. Braham being able to push him on stealing his bow after he drunkenly poured his emotions out.
---
All very feeley shit... But... It works.
---
Mordremoth's mind could not withstand the commander and two companions, because in attempting to stoke anguish in past failures, the commander was confronted with some of their fallen allies and doubts. But instead of folding, the commander and friends where able to flip those memories, use them as strengths and against Mordremoth.
---
Kralktatorrik it turns out was full of anguish for some reason and when we ripped that away, he was much more hospitable to the commander and granddaughter.
---
Aurene herself is full of love of the races, being raised by the commander or Caithe and being taught the virtuousness of organizations like the Pact.
---
So in the end. The commander and Dragon's Watch is well experienced in facing the 'strengths' of the dragon, and using their history and allies to flip that strength into a weakness. With the commanders deft ways of diplomacy, Ryland will flip to our side despite being corrupted. But that also gives the command leverage on a large portion of the icebrood army, eventually pacifying it or even turning it back onto Jormag.
---
And without an army, what is Jormag? it won't be able to convince anyone of it's strength or power. The dragons have been shown to be mostly killable when things get down to their physical bodies. Take it's armies, diminish its power, then and only then, because we can't kill it, it will be time to negotiate, or rather, submit demands to tell Jormag to go back to sleep.
---
Icebrrod Ryland is also a super chill ally.
---
Yeah, the pattern is sort of, dump it in the bank to clear out inventory - &gt; bank is full, hop on an alt to vac it out - &gt; repeat. It would be easier to junk it in the long run, but when I'm at the bank, I just want to clear everything out.
---
I'm also a pack rat, though I'm aiming to be better about that.
---
Nobody can answer how many players there are online, only Arenanet knows and they're not going to tell.  Due to the Megaserver setup, all zones are populated to some extent, even lower level ones, so the number of players shouldn't be a concern to you.  There are enough to meet your needs!
---
I got you!
---
&gt; Last fractal was over a year ago at this point, but it's not important imo. 
---
"This could literally not be more inaccurate". Last fractal was Sirens Reef, released January 8, 2019. 11 months ago.
---
&gt; Adding new fractals/raids doesn't magically fix any problems. People are still catching up
---
I'm sorry, but what kind of stupid reason is that? Stop releasing lw episodes, people are still catching up. Stop releasing new marvel movies, people are still catching up. Mr. One Piece creator, stop making episode 948, I'm still catching up. 
---
The raid scene died because the release cadence is so damn slow. We had 3 raids within 7 months, then one every 8-9 months. How could the raid scene have magically survived? More raids. Nothing less, nothing more. Wing 7 is a nice raid but got cleared within a few hours by the most casual raider without a problem. Imagine you had waited 9 months for A Whisper in the Dark and were done with the story after 1 hour.
---
There was an outfit like three outfits after Leggy armor that really broke the camelâ€™s back.
---
What a waste of obsidian shards :P
---
You'll need to complete a bit of story to get to the zone, plus traveling to frost gorge sound. It's LWS3 episode 3. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Crack_in_the_Ice
---
&gt;Maybe think 
---
Exactly, that's why it's called manipulation.
---
Of the main story or the living world story?
---
Berries is LWS3 E3 there is also E1 (Backpack) and DF (LWS4 last episode) for Mistborne motes
---
Living world story.
---
In one week i will get all of them, but i want to get going the berries thing as i heared is time gated
---
We've been asking for a sylvan hound jackal since the day we've heard of mount skins.
---
2019 when gw 2 pvp is such trash,that you get guide on *how to deal with bots* XD
---
Somewhat. It's basically run around with all your toons and grab berries from bushes
---
My female asura, when picking up another empyreal fragment: "I know of a good use for *this*."
---
Me: Well I wish you'd tell me what that is, because I sure as heck don't know it.
---
Seems like there's really nothing like a common base for western civilization and their first world industrialized countries.
---
I started the game 1 week ago. My main is leveling to 80 the normal way, and the boost i ll use to park a char there. After i get 80 on my main i will gather with it too. The other 2 things u mentioned with backpack are the same thing, requiring to farm smthing over and over again?
---
I would buy GW3 for that.
---
Yes, very much this! Also hopefully let us hide the XP bar.
---
Go core thief while you don't have Daredevil fully unlocked. 
---
Get full 80 exotic berserker gear with decent runes/sigils.
---
And if you are still struggling. Go shortbow/pistol/pistol and kite the hero challenges
---
Edit: try to reach dragon's stand map in HoT, all the HP there are commune and easy to get to, there are 4 that require completion of parts of the meta, but communable afterwards.
---
Don't know, works for me. I get directed to https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/game-release-notes

---
&gt; Keep the bad metaphors rolling.
---
Keep proving my point right about people fetishizing game devs.
---
&gt;The fact is large teams can and will fuck things up. Sometimes its the engineers, sometimes it's the management.
---
And the fact is that gaming development is the only case where said fuckups are consistently and repeatedly not only excused, but actively defended as well.
---
&gt;Here's some reading for you since you think that the scope of GW2 has nothing to do with the number of bugs:
---
Its amazing how you're *this* close to getting it but not quite there yet.
---
After all this time, you still think gaming development is the only complex and big scope profession that exists in the world?
---
You don't think any other big scope professions exist that meet hiccups and bugs? If so that explains a lot about you.
---
good question i've seen some of these never disappearing banners, and once i put one in silverwaste and it stayed for like a day, no idea how to reproduce this though
---
Is the rush worth? I am playing revenant, and i inted to do evrything in the game. Will i be able to get the ascended gear required faster? My main concern are the things that are timegated(like this one). Tbh i dont know where the rush as i understood ascended is just like 5% increase in stats.
---
I always see banners lasting hours, if not days in Malchors Leap, i THINK they last as long as the person who places them remains on the map, bearing in mind the popular tree spot, could be this, though not sure.
---
Yes, you should own both. 
---
On my alt account (had just PoF), that image updated after I signed in and got the in-game alert.
---
you can just teleport to friend, if you have the item ofc
---
It's called sentient anomaly, look it up sweetheart
---
...is what someone would have said in 2013. Nowadays the game projectile vomits obsidian shards at you too.
---
Unless you have an opinion that doesn't 100% follow the crowd and then... suddenly you find yourself banned :)
---
Ok, weâ€™ll miss you!
---
Too much effort to get it
---
To make them last forever you need to die and tp to an WP outside of the map
---
Interesting, so maybe there are better glyphs to go after?  Working on legendary sword so been doin a lot of farming and the trophy shipments give good t6 mats.
---
I know... I know he says "moot loot" but I cannot unhear "moon loot"
---
https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com/
---
I'd be ok with a .50 power multiplier, that should result in 3k-5k crits, but doing 22 crits, is a joke. Whoever at Anet OK this is a hater of Warrior.
---
&gt;Is it, really? 
---
&gt;Cisco's firepower appliances are a steaming pile of horseshit and I have never heard a single person speak of their praises,
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
&gt;And I don't really see this fetishization of game devs either. Most people don't give a shit about bugs. Then you have some very vocal people who go out of their way to declare doom and gloom at the slightest mishap, and you have people reacting to this.
---
Are you really gonna pretend white knights aren't incredibly notorious for gaming companies and especially anet and guild wars? 
---
&gt; Please go reread my last comment.
---
Then please go re-read mine.
---
&gt;I don't get why you're going so hard on bugs. 
---
I don't think I've ever mentioned bugs once in every single one of my comments throughout the entire chain.
---
I do think its kinda funny how you managed to whip yourself up into a frenzy over something you made up in your head though.
---
&gt;A far more apt metaphor would be a dvd player with no play button on the remote.
---
So, you do get the metaphor, but you just refuse to engage with the argument? The issue here is catastrophic fuckups by anet.
---
A dvd player that has no play button is equally worthless as a dvd that eats dvd's. Nobody's gonna defend either one.
---
I'm not sure if the following dialogue in the [Durmand Priory area](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Durmand_Priory_\(location\)) has been there since the inclusion of the [Suspicious Travelers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Suspicious_Traveler) or if it's a more recent addition, but I don't recall hearing it during my many visits to the area when I was investigating the Suspicious Travelers and the whispers surrounding them. It wasn't in the wiki, though, so I added it to the ambient dialogue section.
---
&gt; **Priory Scholar:** That noisy norn is back. Would someone shut him up?  
---
The line is said by a human Priory Scholar (surrounded by an asura Priory Arcanist and charr Priory Explorer) near the stairs leading to the waypoint area and entrance to Priory. He's referring to the Suspicious Traveler norn (who stands near the guarded Pact asura gate to Fort Trinity) who preaches Jormag's gospel and who is surrounded by the creepy backwards whispers in the wind. What makes me suspect this might be a new addition (aside from not encountering this dialogue in prior visits when the Traveler was first added) is that the Scholar says that the norn is back, suggesting that this isn't the first time the Traveler has visited the Priory.
---
If this dialogue turns out to be a recent addition, it may suggest that Jormag's agents or people influenced by it may be interested in Priory's magical artifacts, particularly the [Sanguinary Blade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanguinary_Blade) (aka the Dragon's Blood Blade, a corruptive weapon which dwarves forged from Jormag's frozen blood and which originally ended up in a Stone Summit vault) which Sieran and the Priory-aligned Commander eventually brought to Priory back in personal story.
---
Given the suggestions from Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik, it appears that each Elder Dragon may in fact be vulnerable to their own strength to some extent (e.g. using poisoned magic on Zhaitan and destroying its Eyes and Mouths to weaken it; entering Mordremoth's Mind in the Dream to defeat it and using Caladbolg the thorn of the Pale Tree to destroy the last vestige of ol' Mordy; and using the Dragonsblood Spears and Aurene's resonance on Kralkatorrik), which means that the Sanguinary Blade (and thus Jormag's blood) may in fact be able to severely damage the Ice Dragon.
---
The problem with the blade is that it eventually corrupts its wielder (or anyone it cuts) into an Icebrood as shown with the Sons of Svanir who abused its power, so it's a dangerous weapon even in friendly hands. But if any of Jormag's generals (possibly the trio consisting of kodan, charr and norn seen leading the Icebrood horde in the Icebrood Saga announcement trailer) gets their hands on it, the blade may increase their powers tremendously, so I can see Jormag wanting to secure the blade for these two reasons.
---
I'd love to visit the Priory and Chantry of Secrets again, possibly even the Vigil Keep too for a certain emotional scene, and it'd be chilling if Jormag took a page from Zhaitan's strategy and began using its whispers to influence the norn in these three orders (just like we can already hear stronger and stronger whispers in parts of the Priory) while Bangar's sleeper agents in the orders do their dirty work at the same time. Difficult times may be ahead for Tyria if these three orders are compromised and if these enemies are more successful than the White Mantle infiltrators from a few years ago.
---
It might be worth checking out the locations of each Suspicious Traveler in the Shiverpeaks areas and see if anything has been added or changed since they first appeared. After all, "Ice fortifies. Ice protects." so Jormag's influence is spreading slowly but surely as winter(sday) comes to Tyria with chilly winds from the north. :)
---
No, you just assumed they use commercial programs for building their game and not the in house developed tools we know they have. Who's the idiot now hu? I'm just aware enough to know i don't know how their programs work. You are arrogant enough to assume you do.
---
Thick skin is mandatory for any business where you have to interact with other people, be them customers or coworkers.
---
People can be pretty mean outside the Internet as well; in different ways, yes, but still mean.
---
Aww snap! One day I will join a training like you folks do, but I'm from EU so I gotta find one :)
---
This. It's worked every time I've tried it. Eta: so if you see someone in the grove plop down banners, jump to her death, and then poof out of the zone... this is why. All my characters log out in the grove and I love to be able to log anyone in and have banners available.
---
I mean, to be fair the entirety of Guild Wars 2 has been an end of the world plot. I'd be surprised if they threw a curveball at that now.
---
"Tiny 25 man group".  It's hilarious hearing BG's perspective sometimes.
---
Anet's said before that Jormag appears however it thinks will be viewed most favorably by whoever it's trying to corrupt.
---
My current theory on "Mother" is that it's the true Spirit of Dragon. According to kodan and norn lore, when Tyria was first coming into being, everything was merely nature spirits. And nature spirits are the both representatives and progenitors of physical things; when Owl died, all owls became weaker.
---
By this understanding, there must also be spirits for *everything* out there - just as Egil Fireteller talks of a spirit of fire, mountains, and seasons; there should also be a Spirit of Dragon which represents the lesser dragons in Tyria like hydras, wyverns, and drakes, but also the higher dragons like the six Elder Dragons and their kin.
---
The Elder Dragons themselves may be the "proginators" of the various dragonkin species - like how Kralkatorrik resembles the bone dragons quite a bit, and Mordremoth resembles the [mystical dragons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_(racer))/wurm-like (wurms tend to be dragonkin in several fantasy settings, though they haven't yet in GW but also not denied either). If an Elder Dragon shows up drake-like, another wyvern-like, and a third hydra-like that could prove more accurate.
---
We know that nature spirits can "fall from grace" as we have seen it with Urgoz (a forest spirit), Zhu Hanuku (a sea-animal spirit), and Nulfastu (unspecified nature spirit). I suspect that the reason why the Elder Dragons are tied to The All is because of the Spirit of Dragon - "Mother" - who fell from grace, became greedy for power. This resulted in either a) those who became Elder Dragons imprisoning her by becoming connected to the All, or b) her own power connecting them to The All. This, in turn, forced suffering and torment on them, twisting them over time into the world ravaging beasts we know them as now.
---
Episode 1 hasn't really altered my predictions beyond Jormag's own motivations so:
---
* Given that Episodes 1 and 2 share maps (a Season 2 feature), and ArenaNet told us that there are now 4 teams, I suspect that we'll have 8 episodes (+prologue) in total, like Season 2 - which will be 5 maps for Season 5.
---
* Episode 2 we already know will focus on Drakkar Lake and feature Drakkar as a world boss. Hopefully we won't kill Drakkar - he's too large a lore figure to one-off like that.
---
* Episode 3/4, I suspect, will leave the Shiverpeaks for the centaur and krait shots in the trailer. This foreshadows the appearance of either that "horrible things \[that\] lurk on the horizon" (Primordus? DSD? "Mother"? Something else?).
---
* Episode 5/6 will return to the Far Shiverpeaks, where we face Ryland as a "mid-season" boss, and will be redeemed by witnessing Bangar becoming an icebrood general.
---
* Episode 7/8 will focus on the final chase against Bangar (and Drakkar) who will be the season finale boss, with us attempting to stop the rise of Jormag. However, we'll fail at the end, and the season will end with Jormag's return.
---
The use? Annoying the player character, of course. Your asura knows it.
---
&gt; Better analogy is if you started shouting in the restaurant that the chef should kill himself because the food arrived at your table cold.
---
&gt;(no, they don't need to die)
---
&gt; But there are good and bad ways of doing it.
---
Ah yes, those mythical death threats that nobody actually ever sees any of, and the 3 are posted every 2 years are immediately downvoted to obscurity.
---
Lets play a game. Give me examples of all this toxicity that you speak of. Find me as many threads as you can with 50-100 upvotes that you consider toxic and lets see what you find.
---
&gt;And if you feel they are consistently failing you, then I'd recommend you treat them like the restaurant in your analogy and take your business elsewhere. It'd be insane to do otherwise.
---
Sound advice to keep the game alive.
---
I'm sorry to tell you but this is NOT an actual raid. It's much less punishing but it does take a bit of strategy. 2 healers, 2-4 people assigned to torches and add control on said torch, if option A doesnt work go with option B. Sounds like pugs are stacking 4-5 healers and just face tanking everything or running 2 and doing mechanics. You need to dodge, you need to watch your feet for the AOE and you need to stack (much easier to heal, buff, aegis etc) you running around and not watching means death and wipe, welcome to real raids where Demios Oil, VG/Cairn blue, Sloths shake, Sam's spear and slam all will kill you.
---
You have no choice in that matter - elite specs' skills and traits unlock one by one in a predefined order.
---
id rather have moot loot half the time, playing inventory wars isnt fun
---
well,by those numbers i just told you,you gona miss ALOT of ppl =))
---
ANet also announced that was a very early concept art which has changed since revealing it.
---
I am hopeful that the attention to GW1 Drakkar has made them make a more familiar design rather than something more befitting the [ice column creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ice_column_statue).
---
I'll definitely join. Awesome of you to organize this!
---
If anyone has video evidence of any hackers in the past year, please send them to my inbox where I will be meticulously investigating every single clip. We need to at the very least get names and appearances in my database to warn as many guilds as possible.
---
Statistically speaking, it is rather rare.
---
Have you considered taking a break? Your relationship with the game seems unhealthy.
---
Deso is t1 many coz u cover all bl with blobs. Deso server have little to no skilled players , just numbers and insane ppt. No one wish to fight with ur blobs sitting in t3 towers with 20 acs.
---
awesome, thank you! did you mean the build i linked or another build someplace?
---
BG has been manually locked since forever, only open for a few hours a couple times a year. Some guilds have transferred off, some have stopped playing, some only raid once per week. There's only one guild raiding  consistently now, plus a couple small havok's that count on PUGS. I logged in last night to my other two accounts, TC and YB, which both had queues on two maps, then got on my BG account, which had no queues on reset, and only one commander (Leafy). So it's simply a numbers game. KDR is good but most scouts suck anymore and BG can't hold objectives.
---
  
---
Until BG is either unlocked or linked, it'll be a T2/T3 server for PPT, but most always &gt; 1.0 KDR.
---
The one with the dragon? I did these achievements earlier today and it has a challenge mote just for the fight which appears after you kill the dragon.
---
Please explain how a fraction of all the content in this game that you cannot clear in one go equals focusing on tryhard content.
---
A 100% focus on anything is bad. A 100% focus on hardcore will not sustain a game ( a lesson we can learn from WildStar), but focusing on 100% casual content will neither, you need both audiences. For that you need content for both. Casual players have the entirety of core Tyria and its dungeons ( bar perhaps Arah), they have PoF openworld, living season maps..
---
What do the "tryhards" have?
---
A few raids with raids basically dead in the water when it comes to development?
---
Fractals where even tier 4 can be cleared without really knowing what you are doing and no new fractals for almost a year?  
---
Strike missions that prÃ© buffed Boneskinner were glorified loot bags?
---
A casual player in this game has it pretty good.
---
Now please let those of us who like a bit more challenging content to have a piece of the pie as well.
---
And if you want in on our piece of the pie, please come, we will teach you.
---
Just don't cry out for nerfs or for Anet to stop making such content.
---
Now this is a find!
---
Is there a group for EU?
---
&gt;Now all these threads complaining you are outnumbered, when thatâ€™s just a normal thing for every server. Welcome to how all the other servers feel.
---
Um, mathematically impossible. Every server can't be outnumbered....
---
your have an unhealthy addiction to gw2. seek professional help
---
Nice video :)
---
But..... You dont need 4 healers. You can bring 4 healers, but 2 are enough.
---
Done it with 2x tempest, 1x tempest+1x herald, 1x tempest+1x druid, 1x scrapper+1x healfb in pugs so far. Getting gold is a lot easier if you dont overstack on healers.
---
I'd rather not waste my time. My point wasn't that death threats are happening every day. It was that that was one of the activities I have actually heard people call toxic (and would agree that it is when it happens). I have not heard "there is a bug here" called toxic yet. Given your scenario that seems to be what you are claiming people find toxic. I've never seen that. 
---
In your scenario, do you care about keeping the restaurant alive? Or is a game somehow more sacred and shouldn't be shut down like any business with bad service? 
---
The advice is for people who do not like the game or the way it's being managed/handled. While I would dislike the game being shut down, I will still recommend that people who don't like it play other games. They aren't happy with this one, and I would rather they were happy.  People who love the game, but still want to improve it aren't who this advice is for.
---
thanks, iâ€™ll probably give it a shot! iâ€™ve got berserker/scholar gear right now. any thoughts on what might be better suited/ideal if i feel like investing more?
---
you mentioned diviner, any thoughts on runes/sigils?
---
Agreed, there are very few and far between instances where you would hide any of the menus permanently. If you engage in more than literally one game mode, every single option limits your view. 
---
Hiding the minimap in pvp/wvw? Nope
---
Hiding the menus? Nope
---
Hiding your skills? Nope
---
Hiding your targets? Nope
---
Hiding the chat? Maybe
---
Hiding the content guide? Maybe
---
The only thing I cant think of hiding is the xp bar, which isnt even an option.
---
If you do this, is it "locked in" once you do it? i.e., can you reenter the map and it'll still stay? Does it matter if it's with a different character?
---
Press \\
---
Another thing that's bothered me:
---
Does this somehow affect other banners that are already up?
---
I've been in maps where there are 3 or 4 hero banners right next to each other... but if I try to put ANY banners down, I can't because there is 'already a banner of that kind up'
---
...so how tf did people manage to get 4 of them up??
---
turn Empyreal Fragments into toxic crystal
---
&gt; Even more suspicions arose when my primary reddit account u/ShadowTheInfamous was removed from reddit after revealing this investigation
---
and that's where you go over the cliff and lose all semblance of credibility.
---
True.
---
[deleted user] means they deleted the account. account that doesn't say is banned but can still be used is most likely shadow banned by reddit. you can appeal in  r/shadowban
---
"It'll fetch a nice price!"
---
*item is account bound*
---
It could be related to failure of the map meta, which currently pretty much always succeeds.
---
I think the wounds are to big to heal, his job seems like to try and make the game as comfortable as it can be before succumbing to death.
---
I have dropped banners at the Draconis Mons flax farm, farm the flax, log-off, log on the next day and sometimes it is still there, sometimes for a week.
---
Ah, this is average gameplay.
---
&gt; a group of individuals that aim to systematically destroy our Guild Wars 2 community and defame the reputation of Arena Net 
---
Oh, you mean "Arena Net themselves"?
---
please play other class, this was the most horrible elementalist gameplay I have ever seen. Also shit build.. Sorry but thats just the fact. No wonder you were all keep dying there. Casuals need to learn how to play proper builds.  
---
Why you are using scepter? Is this condi build? Then why the hell you stay water? Oh you are the healer? Then why the hell would you use scepter? Also dont use your signet for heal ever. You would do better to get downed and ressed rather then take your heal signet on cooldown.   
---
If you are a heal tempest use dagger, but on this fight you should use staff. If you are power use dagger, and dont ever go water, you are not healer , your heals are SHIT, team need you to do dmg if you are DPS. If you are condi use dagger, and NEVER go water.  
---
Dude you made me so angry with this shitty gameplay of yours. This is why no one want to take elementalist in pugs, they are so bad. Just like you. I have never seen such a bad elementalist. Please for the love of god change class for something easier. You cant , CANT play elementalist !.
---
I hope I will never get you in my runs man. Please learn to play.
---
Jesus christ I keep watching and I just cant believe what I am seeing. You running like chicken without head. STOP  And they way you try to use your skills but they are ground targeted and your cursor is in your ass so you cant make the skill work, and you keep pressing it in panic. Jesus dude.
---
ok another edit. For the love of everything nice in this world. I noticed you have 100kk karma, 45k gold, evey item  gw2 player would want, full 32 slots bags setup. And possibly many many more. You are long time advenced player. HOW THE FUCK YOU MANAGED TO PLAY FOR SO LONG AND STILL BE SO BAD?
---
No one uses this damn meme right anymore &gt;.&lt;
---
His rants read like something Francis E. Dec. Esq. would write.
---
WHat? Impressive? This was the most horrible run I have ever seen. With normal , good players , 2 healers , or 3 to be save, you will dont see that many downed players. People on the video were running like head less chickend every where. This run was disgusting bad. I hope you will one time see some good players action. If this impressed you, you will not believe your eyes when you see a really good run.
---
I don't know if you're intentionally trying to not understand or if you're just that ignorant. You're listing content that is consumed one time and you're done. Raids are repeatable content. Good repeatable content does not consistent new content. 
---
Fractals are plenty alive compared to Raids, yet there's similar amount to content. Just check the LFG for proof. Pvp scene has the least amount of content yet is still alive since launch, there's your evidence that you don't need consistent new content for keeping game modes alive. 
---
Raids are dead because the systems around them make it too hard to actually get into the content, the content itself is not the problem. Use that big brain of yours and think about reality for second, instead of repeating the same reddit arguments. Adding more raids does not solve the issue that finding groups is too difficult, and you are shit out of luck if you don't join a training LFG guild. The current LFG system simply fails at getting new players into the content. Difficulty getting into new content means less players doing the content, which means dead content.
---
Killing living story would absolutely kill the entire game and create far more problems.
---
it sounds like there's not much for me to do :D
---
