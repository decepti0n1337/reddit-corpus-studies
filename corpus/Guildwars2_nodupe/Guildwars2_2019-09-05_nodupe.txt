I agree actually.
---

---
Sadly, I think a better nerf would have been to nix the effect of bounty tools on the herbs and make it so you got ruined plants if you didn't have 500 cooking when gathering.
---
This really hurts the social aspect of the home instances. Whether that was an intended design of home instances, they have garnered a strong social component, and I think this change really harms that. Now instance sharers will start planting basic plants and actively avoiding ascended crops.
---
---
---
It does make more sense for them to be gender-neutral. But if that's the case why are Kralkatorrick, Glint and Aurene gendered?
---
The Cantha/factions storyline was really cool. I disagree strongly with your statement. 
---
Prophecies was a little contrived and gw2 lore has been subpar but Factions was fantastic compared to its contemporaries and nightfall was good too.
---
This is still very cheap if you plant and gather yourself my man. It is a 1 hour duration food that can be gotten by anyone and if you craft yourself, the cost will be incredibly low buying everything, if my math is right, right now if you gather everything, it will only cost 70 silver~ for most of everything. Festival is around the corner and that will bring down the compost prices

[removed]
---
Testbed should be a full duplicate and not a limited setup.  Especially for complex systems.
---
We did that for all of our products.  It's part of QC/QA.
---
The circle-jerk is there, certainly.  Are you really so surprised that there are people who don't feel like you do about this game?
---
in that regard imo their reasoning is weak but has some semblance of sense. the bigger meme is that you aren't even allowed to offer your HI for free via the LFG now...
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that brought players and guilds together to actually act as a community.
---
That does bring into question what the lines of succession are now for the Flame Legion. Who is their imperator, if they even have one, now that Gaheron's dead? And why are they playing nice so suddenly, is it a ploy or are they that desperate?
---
So ... what are the chances we will get a followup 
---
&gt; Fixed a bug that allowed for additional gathering attempts on ascended plant nodes
---
Someone bought back the "table" ?
---
&gt; It isn't there to hook people to buy the game, it is there to get people interested in the upcoming event and show that they are doing something different for Icebrood Saga.
---
And it could have been done in a better way as has been detailed in this thread.
---
You can get them on the trading post. It isn't pay to win at all.
---
I am not a fan of this change, but it is not an issue of pay to win.
---
And why not the ascended herbs? Lets hear some logic behind that. Cause I can't think of a damn thing.
---
good point. like I been saying. LW5 is the lead up for the Expansion announcement, but Anet once again being secretive like they were in Vanilla. In Vanilla they didnt even tell us they changed their mind on Expansions until LW2 revealed it.
---
Guilds? what is that?
---
&gt;Gamergate, shortly after starting, was no longer about specific figures or incidents.
---
Because the specific people being criticized decided to make it about anonymous trolls and crazies.
---
Thats exactly what OP is talking about. Its easy to whip up the crazies into a frenzy and use them to avoid real issues.
---
&gt; I bought everything for my home insctance so others doesnt need to. Took me around 10 000g and 3 000 - 5 000 gems to get it all.
---
~7,5k if you get all gem nodes via gold -&gt; gems. Around 4-5k, if you buy the sellable nodes when they are cheap (BLC rotation). ;)
---
&gt; it can take even half hour when those inside are slow.
---
Wow, I invite many players (expecially since cooking 500) and it they never took longer than 10 minutes to harvest everything. Not even the slowest who broke their gathering tools and needed a vendor.
---
I know, only minor points, but your points.
---
&gt; after they pretty much out of the blue declared a couple of weeks ago that sharing the home instance via LFG isn't allowedanymore
---
They didn't...
---
It's something that is going to have be addressed at some point. If it's all glossed over and they have a kumbaya moment off screen, many fans will be upset.
---
The LW episodes will unlock for free even if you don't have PoF, you just won't be able to play them until you get it.
---
You don't need PoF, just log in while it's active (ie, before the next episode releases) and you'll essentially "bank" it for later
---
a follow up nerf to remove additional gathering chance
---
i would call it them saying that expansions are not officially done for gw2, rather than a non answer. its like, we didnt know HoT was coming until they announced it, and before that, they had repeatedly said that not only could it be considered, but that they dont want to. they obviously changed gears. its like, if the demand is high enough then it will be a logically sound move. and they know the demand is high enough
---
So young to be so cynical.
---
To make 1 ascended food, you now have to do these steps:
---
1. farm the varietal seed, lets say that takes 1 minute of time, I guess the market will say that's worth 50s
---
2. craft a seed pouch, which is 7s to vendor + extract of nourishment which might be 5-10s
---
3. plant the seed pouch and wait a day to gather (max 12 per day if you spend 2000 gems on extra plots), let's guess the market values the time gate at 25-50s
---
Recipes differ slightly, but the cost goes up by another 1s-1g.
---
So, depending on the recipe, I estimate ascended foods will cost between 88s-2g17s.
---
I think these prices suck and I probably won't bother myself for some piddly bonus as it is. I think Anet needs to get more creative with food to make it interesting. If they bump it up to 2+hrs it might make sense to me.
---
Yeah when things become easier just limit urselfnin real life, blind urself, cut ur fingers off etc.
---
On a more serious note, they should implement changes not us downgrading our toons until we find it difficult enough. Current dungeons on HM could work (extra HP, some bug fixes and added mechanics, rewards).
---
Engaging your brain in a game is fun for some people.
---
:)
---
Gearing a power class is easier then gearing a condition class, generally speaking. For raiding, most people accept you gearwise if you bring ascended weapon+trinkets and exotic armor.
---
The [regrown Caladbolg quest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Regrown_Caladbolg) gives you access to one weapon.
---
If you are in need of raiding builds, check out www.snowcrows.com and if you want organised training groups, I can highly recommend [The Crossroad Inn discord](https://discord.gg/nZg52r3) for EU. NA has the [Raid Academy server](https://discord.gg/x4uNQpy).
---
Raiding is great, a lot of fun and profitable aswell, but be prepared to encounter a little less wholesome conversational tone then what is often used in the open world :P
---
Don't let the stop you though. 
---
PS: Don't forget to grab some HoT masteries. Most of them are optional, but getting basic gliding and jumping mushrooms is very advisable. Also, don't attempt to kill Xera without Leyline gliding.
---
Never heard of this site, are they reputable?  Also is it a big deal if they aren't on Anet's "official retailers" list?  I'm looking to buy a few alts, just don't want to waste money.
---
edit: nevermind, they are an official retailer if you select Brazil in the dropdown
---
Just bought it from Canada. But before you actually get the key, they warn you it only works for playing in US servers. Not planing on redeeming soon tho.
---
Primordus likes it keep it simple.
---
I'm hoping for solo easy mode, strike moderate group mode, and hardcore raid mode, but I'm a hopeless dreamer.
---
But how else do you evenly mix the different types of meats in your meat salad?
---
Yeah, this is the kind of stuff people wanted:  Signs of life.
---
I dunno what they were thinking on announcement day—it’s like they wanted to put everyone on tilt except the one guy out there who only bought PoF.
---
GW3 from this team? That is both smaller and less experienced? I sincerely hope it.
---
A conflagration is a fire that causes widespread destruction, but yeah, not too far from just fire.
---
So like the LS1 fractals? I dig it. Anything that adds replay value to LW is a good thing.
---
and yet they still haven't gotten to my bug report from several weeks ago about infinite gathering tools NOT gathering 4 times per interact like they used to UNLESS they are using the new glyph, Glyph of the Crucible, the addition of which is probably what caused this bug in the first place
---
So proto gw3 it's still gonna be on the same engine?
---
Completely original creations by the author!
---
Man, looking back on the shitshow that was HoT release and putting that into perspective.. Downhill we go!
---
honestly, I would've settled for a fix that makes you have to replant every day if ANYONE harvests your garden. at least then its still able to be shared, even if you do still have to replant daily
---
Probably because it had too much impact.
---
If you share all the other nodes, it doesn't really matter, because you can gather them everywhere else too and sometimes even faster. 
---
But ascended crops only can be gathered in home instances. I personally invited 2 groups minimum everyday to my home instance, that means my homeinstance generated 8 times more ascended crops than I would be able to gather alone. And it doesn't stop at 8 people. Other players shared their homes too. 
---
Also I always invited my alt account, so I could get double loot per day. However, other players have way more alt accounts. I heared from players with 11 and 15 alts. 
---
All this flooded the TP with cultivated crops. Before this update *Varietal Peppercorn Seeds* where even more expensive than the actual *Cultivated Peppercorns* (45s vs 35s). So you actually *loosed* gold if you planted this seeds. Currently, after patch, it's fixed btw.
---
Also because of this surplus of ascended crops, any kind of ascended power food ended up being *cheaper* than the best single power food, Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup. Just to make it clear, before patch it was ~10s cheaper to craft an ascended food with additional bonuses that can be used by unlimited players and lasts 1 hour long than to craft a "normal" food only for yourself that lasts 30 minutes long. It was only right to stop this madness.
---
There's something in the water!
---
...meat...salad...
---
Get lost asura, charr are the most genius-est of the Tyrian races.
---
Balthazar and palawa joko pls
---
Not sure how that would even be enforced when you can freely transfer between EU and NA servers.  But maybe they have some system in place I don't know about.
---
There are other things locked to the home owner btw, the enchanted chest and the black lion supply drop hunters board thingy.
---
Yeah I get what you mean. I was hoping they could save time by reusing the same design, but add more mechanics for the raids
---
Four.  I only play WvW.  Guess which 4.
---
edit:  On a related note, reddit changes "4." to "1." because it assumes I want to start a list lol
---
They make no distinction between selling or offering free, its using the LFG feature itself that gets you temp banned.
---
ANET needs to at least make LS2 free. Maybe even LS3.
---
Too many people skip LS2 and feel confused.
---
People also keep skipping LS1.... Hmm.....
---
Not even the mounts?
---
Anet has test servers, factually true. We've seen raid guilds testing raids on them and getting credit for it. Let's see this magical quote of yours, because I'm calling bullshit right now.
---
grandmaster chef
---
I’m curious to know if you could get a refund if you bought the plots to farm them with alts or allow friends and guildies to do so.
---
I mean, their value / convenience has just been nuked. Their was no disclaimer on them when they sold them, and I bet people bought some thinking they could use these plants in them like all the others.
---
They sold items with one functionality, and then patched that functionality out, with no recompense.
---
Seems a little scummy. 
---
(Disclaimer: I already had the garden plots from when they came out, and made primers with them regularly, and farmed a ton of these ascended things already so it doesn't matter to me in the slightest).
---
They also show gw2 consistently underperforming according to NCsoft themselves.
---
The default way to uninstall any program is to use the Windows Control Panel. If you copied GW2 over, you will have to manually delete the game files, files under My Documents, files under %appdata%, and the registry entries manually.
---
Oh man. That alone will just make me go back to farming the primer plants. One swing and done - see ya tomorrow garden plot lol.
---
Yeah, at this point, they have to swallow their pride and broker peace with the other legions. Though they'll probably have to agree to a pretty raw deal, and nobody will trust them for a long time. But it could eventually lead to positive change within the group by the time of GW3. Could also be a splinter group, like how the Olmakhan were originally an offshoot of Flame Legion rebels.
---
There wasn't an announcement or anything that I could see but some GM replied to a thread that they consider it abuse if using the LFG feature for home instance sharing, that then coincided with a load of bans being handed out all of a sudden. So either they implemented new policy, or someone went on a crusade reporting people on old policy that was never really enforced in the past, since I've been using LFG for home instance sharing for years now without issue. 
---
There were a ton of threads about all this in the last few weeks if you were to do a search. 
---
(I say all this as someone who got a 3hr ban for using LFG to advertise my full *free* home instance after some random player joined the party and threatened to report me, evidently successfully. The ban said it was for an abuse of the EULA and terms of service, despite nothing in both that refers to home instance sharing via LFG)
---
The store page CSS always doesn't load for me for some reasons.
---
Depends on the build. Old chrono had quite a strict rotation to upkeep boons (before the 300 reworks). Druid has no rotation, just use CA when it comes up and spam 4 : 1 : 2 all you can before it runs out. It differs. For alacrigade it should just be the power renegade rotation + orders from above off cooldown.
---
Ironically it wasn't good gold at all, because the TP was flooded by ascended crops. They used to be worth 30s and less. Now, after patch, they are at 1g+ (again).
---
Wait you're naked in the default version of the skin? Doesn't it completely cover your body with the star like thing like astralaria?
---
NA
---
I’m playing classic now, cause I never did way back when, and my mates are.
---
Dude, it’s the most fucking awful experience. The ONLY good thing is group content. Every other aspect - graphics, lvling, moving around, combat - is absolute dogshit.
---
I can see now what Blizzard did. They made a game so annoying and restrictive and slow, that it forced you to sub for ages, just to slog through the content.
---
And it worked. Clever really.
---
Interesting, good to know. I guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
If you gather seeds on your own (which doesn't take long) and use your own plants, it's still as cheap as it was before. It's more worthy, but not more expensive four you.
---
If you buy seeds or even the ascended crops, it will be more expensive.
---
However, ascended crops are at ~1g now, instead of ~30s. Power food were at ~40s , now it's about 1,1g. Condition food were at ~1,5g (thank you, flatbread), now it's about 2,2g. So if you share your power food with at least one other player, it's still worth it (some more for condition food). And since you can share it with your whole squad or even the whole map, I think it's still worth to make.
---
The pop-ups are.  Not the “press F to interact” that will sometimes take precedence over opening, say, a chest in AB/TD.
---
Edit: clarified what I said, because it’s not actually _that_ bad.
---
She has an entire library including her own private writings, Kormir probably edited this
---
For someone with multiple accounts to take advantage of how it worked, it was definitely lucrative.
---
It might be a less popular opinion, I think this is a better change overall for making money (for most players with 1-2 accounts per household, anyway). 
---
I was able to dig up 30 Cilantro today from my instance's 12 nodes (Glyph of Bounty, Guild Harvesting Bonus, Item Booster thanks to Candy Corn Gobbler, etc) and made an easy 40g when people were panic buying. Cilantro had now regulated itself to almost 1g each right now, but I expect it to drop a little bit more. 
---
Conservatively, if I can farm 20g-30g of Cilantro each day, and 250 packets of Ascended Cilantro seed cost about 100g with efficient food extractions, then this will be a nicely lucrative harvest over time. Of course, this doesn't take into account the 2 extra plots of land purchased from the Black Lion store, but even still. It's the sort of profit I'd want and expect from a level 500 crafting profession. 
---
And even if I didn't want to go through the upfront cost, planting, harvesting, and risk of selling ascended plants like Cilantro, the Gourmet collection is still worth it just for the Charr line (rare meat unlocks from all the world's animals) and the Sylvari line (rare seed unlocks from all the world's herb nodes).
---
I think Anet hit Cooking 500 out of the park, honestly. I love the way it is. I only wish Anet allowed my old 60 minute food to stay 60 minutes.
---
I still can't wait for the new Tuck Chingle novel "Pounded in the Butt by One of My Ancestral Enemies"
---
So this is just gonna be conjecture, but I'd wager Anet hasn't done this yet because they'd be expected to expand to core maps, then expansion maps, then instances within maps like dungeons/raids/home etc.
---
Call it a lack of resources, it's just not important to them, cost outweighs the benefits, idk.
---
I just opened the pdf and read it. They could have done with not making the text a part of the pdf, but it was easily legible except for the artist interview for me.
---
&gt; A dying battle cry of what?
---
For the horde??  :p
---
Halloween is coming, and after that XMas. If ascended cooking means that ToT and presents are always valuable, that's fine.
---
Can anyone from EU confirm that the key works?
---
Colin was the face of the hype train a la thomas the tank engine.
---
&gt; I think these prices suck and I probably won't bother myself for some piddly bonus as it is.
---
Why do you think these prices suck? Making power food is still way than the Butternut Squash Soup. It's even cheaper (because you get 1h buff instead of 30mins), you get an additional effect -&gt; life leech = more dmg *and* you are able to share it with your whole squad or even the whole map. 
---
Craft life leech power food by yourself and it costs around 1g currently. Share it with 5 people (i.e. your squad) and you are at 20s per player for 1h food. Instead of 1g+ for 2 butternut soups per person.
---
But that's the thing, I'm more than happy to continue to *buy to play* content to ensure it's relatively good quality (or quantity) content.
---
That's pretty neat.
---
&gt; I just cannot get over how easily triggered alt-right goons get.
---
[When you play right into the stereotype.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ct66pXFWcAA3cot.jpg)
---
100% agreed. LS2 should be free, LS3 should be 50% off and LS4 should be 25% off once LS5 starts.
---
Additionally there should be a package combining all LS seasons prior to the current season, once the new season starts.
---
Didn't we all look a little derpy as teens?
---
This is an excellent comment.  
---
I have 8 years' experience in software development.  I know first hand what it is like to work with bad managers in this industry.  The quality of the end product definitely suffers when you're forced to work with bad managers.  
---
NC Soft cleaning house sounds like a dream scenario for me.
---
Fifty dollar-euros?!
---
oh btw everyone the servers haven't been online in 5 years, you've imagined all of it
---
&gt; the devs are, in some sense, failing to make the game satisfying for everyone
---
There's proof that they can do this, even from their own franchise. I really haven't heard many people, if any at all, complain about Nightfall. There's proof right there that you can tell a good story in this universe. 
---
&gt; Have hope in the future of the game
---
I honestly find it hard to share your optimism. I've seen Anet go from a company that can tell compelling stories to one that throws everything at the wall, hoping something will stick.
---
Wait, so the default costume has abs?
---
You're so right. I wish more people would realize how important the PAX event was even though it didn't tell them what they wanted. It's going to help the game's health, and in turn, the rest of us.
---
I just can't see this game doing anything better than *sustaining* its current player count unless there's a massive hype train again. 
---
Maybe GW2 needs a FF XIV ARR -esque reboot.
---
gooby pls
---
&gt; My human ele picked that he was descended from Ascalonians in the personal story.
---
Bold of you to assume anet remembers that the personal story exists.
---
Taimi says we should ask Aurene *what gender the other dragons identify as*.
---
Cause ANet really cares about the price of something on the TP.
---
The ascended herbs are akin to the daily timegated materials like Deldrimor Steel. Letting them remain communal harvests is like saying every time I make Deldrimor Steel, 4 random people ALSO get that.
---
And all the staff at ArenaNet. They care the most about the gender of a dragon.
---
Henchies/heros or GTFO
---
Anet tried content that caterers to one or the other instead of both.....single biggest f up
---
I did not think that was going to be a real subreddit.  I regret testing that theory.
---
Question is it too little too late?
---
Good change. It was very quickly becoming a heavy loss to harvest your own ascended plants. Now things might restabilize to make it a bit of a profit, like crafting the T7 daily mats. Also glad I made that 2000 compost immediately while food was still cheap, lul.
---
Lok’tar Ogar!
---
The truth is that Anet push politics through the game narrative ignoring that the diversity of this community includes  muslims, hindis and christians. "No giving a sh” doesn’t make you more virtuous or morally superior. The game was supposed to be neutral in these questions.
---
You all joke. But isn't this exactly what was the Ascended backpack recording items from Sandswept Isles? 24 recording that can't be stacked, that can't be deleted, or sold, and time gated - messing up inventory space..
---
Didn't take very long for the chuds to come out of the woodwork... 
---
This affects you literally none, but I can see you're one of those throwaway accounts with wildly negative karma, so go off my guy
---
But the opposite just happened. Because of all the sharing, it was a gold *loss* to plant and harvest ascended plants. Now it might end up being good gold.
---
And? It's an accurately worded question.
---
Jormag is mentioned with male pronouns in a couple of Hearts.
---
The ascended nodes in the home instance can't even be interacted with if you are not the home instance owner.  I want them to apply this exact technology to personal merchants.
---
technical limitations, a lot of your character data is linked to your race, available skills, the entire first 1/2 of your story, NPC interactions, etc.
---
You say fact, even though Jormag is non-binary, not gender fluid. Did you even bother to find out what the term means?
---
Got I hate anti-intellectualism. Are you anti-vaxx too?
---
Got any unsee juice?
---
&gt;I really would love to play GW1 but I just couldn't understand what I was doing. I got to a point where I think I was too weak to progress. I did enjoy it until that point.
---
did you play Guil wars Prophecies or one of the Standalone addons ?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Prophecies tells you way more and progresses slowly ( and great lvl 1-20 roughly over 70-80% of the game JUST PERFECT ) while the addons throw you way faster into stronger enemys.
---
[deleted]
---
I wish I knew more about Macs but... Do they have something similar to drivers? Like does Intel have a software you could update for the graphics potentially? I'm sorry I don't know much about anything outside of Windows haha
---
It may only cost 1g to craft, but how much gold is a person losing by spending time gathering and not selling their seeds/herbs/meat on the TP?
---
for support revenant in particular, I'd say its more important that you drain your energy to 0 and then swap legends right as your legend swap comes off of cooldown. drop your most important legend skills each time you're in that legend and try to balance your energy upkeep so that you won't run out of energy before swap is ready or have a bunch left over when you're ready to swap
---
When story line was introduced at launch it was sold as decisions have consequences. Your choices create your toon. I very seriously doubt they will change that since selling slots is a big income stream. Fortunately slots on sale are pretty cheap and you can outfit full exotics for lass than 10g in basic zerker gear
---
This is the most likely answer.
---
Source: I am a dev
---
and you will forever be known as the guy who gives a fuck about genderfluid dragons in games
---
Who fucking cares?  It's a big ass dragon. Fuck sake, people are looking for the tiniest bit of drama.
---
What adventure did you take to end up here?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cwvw22/herb_seed_locations/
---
Multiple different farming routes and locations in this thread.  I know I've seen a spreadsheet as well, but my very lazy search attempts didn't bring it up, sorry.
---
Edit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cwydi6/verdant_herbs_route_at_bitterfrost_frontier_for/  The comments here list a few more locations and also has the spreadsheet I was looking for.
---
I agree people should have seen this coming, but they charged money for these things, and gave no warning or disclaimer.
---
People could have purchased these items and reasonably assumed that all plants would function the same in them.
---
They should have put a warning. Again I ask, if you purchased these, with the intent of sharing, as you can with all the other plants, should you get a refund?
---
They clearly marketed them at the same time to occur as the ascended cooking was introduced, so the expectation is they would be attractive to people who wanted extra plants.
---
i.e. they sold an item that functions one way, then changed that function after the fact. A purchaser has effectively not got what they paid for.
---
How about instead of banning people for trolling, you take away their ability to troll in the first place? You can never ban all trolls, that's a waste of time if you don't fix what they're using to troll with, because new trolls will always crop up.
---
that's Gorrik's footnote not Taimi's
---
What was even better was that they had to be turned in in an exact order, and the event 2/3 of the way through the set was disabled for weeks...
---
O_o well yeah.. it would be pretty dumb not to care about the economy of the game they run.
---
Unfortunately, it's been that way for a long time on my Mac Pro.  This is a windows-to-mac driver cross over issue.  Something is going wrong in the texture management, so there really isn't anything simple that I know of that you can do for it.
---
Now, if you're so inclined: you could try running WINE or Crossover and loading the windows client that way.  Alternatively, you can run Windows in a VM (going to have performance issues) or make a boot camp partition to run Windows natively.
---
My big worry is that I'm going to have to choose between the next release of MacOS and Guild Wars 2: MacOS is dropping 32 bit code support.  Give ArenaNet's bandwidth, I'll be surprised if they keep the client going in anything more than "well, if it works for you."
---
or use the same technology as the portable wvw merchant... no reason to summon a damn npc every time
---
For less than 10g, nah bro, here main level up speed runner character and I can say that only armor exotic full zerker costs between 15 and 20 g
---
&gt; ...he looks iconic :D 
---
Not so iconic anymore, you'll get it stolen, horns included.
---
Look for zerk stats on named armor like Aiden's. I do it all the time
---
It wasn't a bug. It was an "issue". Meaning that they didn't forsee the way people were selling their crops to others for gathering rights in the homes. They'd rather disable it , cause that pushes garden plot sales.
---
Exactly . It isn't a coincidence that garden plots returned to the store.

I haven't checked the proper places yet, but I remember during the bl key discount and char slot discount recently, the highest I saw was 400gems for 196gold, did it go any higher than that? Nuts.

You got roasted 🤣
---
You know, I really regret putting this much thought into my response. Guess I should have just left a downvote and moved on instead.
---
They can influence gem prices in many ways. Either by adjusting the economy, such as the griphon gold sink. Or they can directly adjust the gem balance or a coefficient in their equation, if they where so inclined.
---
Of course they can do it, the control everything. And they certainly have done indirect things to control it. We however, don't know if they have ever done a direct adjustment.
---
I really want 5 man strike missions. That would be soooo much fun.

Well yes, it would. Why wouldn't it?
---
In case you haven't realized, [this is supposed to be a parody](https://preview.redd.it/fgwvt91p2h0y.jpg?width=480&amp;height=251.308900524&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccc6cfb9719deca08064817b3b2428ded77ad46f), not a guide to everyday life, despite you using it as such.
---
They did announce this iirc, they just didnt explain it at all. I do specifically remember them saying they were working on a magazine for in game news.
---
I have 8 years’ experience in software development and this makes a lot of sense to me.  It sounds like ANet have a bunch of uncontrolled Development environments rather than a properly controlled Test environment.  
---
I’ve experienced this first hand and it sucks.  Generally what happens is you get a situation where bugs appear in Production but not Development/Test because they’re completely different.  Ideally you want controlled Test/Pre-Production Environments that are close as possible to the Production Environment.  
---
The testing software the developer is talking about is probably software that automatically executes test cases.  These are indeed expensive.  Any sort of IT Service Management software is “stupidly expensive” as a rule of thmb.
---
Just keep it in mind if you ever want to do this again. 😉
---
I definitely appreciate, you guys are exactly why guild wars community has awesome players. Each of you care and support one another, so the thank you. I should have planned this a bit better.
---
Did not expect this to clear up the Dragon's Domains. After how much HoT built them up, it was strange to see Kralk's second domain not covered in PoF or S4. But at least we got it here, along with Jormag's and it seems like Primordious's as well. Also, it cleared up Aurene's domain, but just the one... Bubbles is still a mystery with just mention of water and ocean; the latter of which doesn't fit the other secondary domains. Also, it does seem to suggest that the Mouth of Mordremoth was its proper body, even if extended like a serpent over the entire jungle, rather than just one of many heads.
---
They are a lead in to raids. To get more casual players into them.
---
True. And after all who would want play LS2 after doing HoT? Or LS3 after doing PoF?
---
Imagine a new player going through the content in this order: Base -&gt; HoT -&gt; PoF -&gt; LS2 -&gt; LS3 -&gt; LS4
---
It's like reading books or watching movies in the order 1 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 7 and with 2 missing.
---
After all this IS the order a new players would probably take if they want more content after playing the expansions. It just makes no sense.
---
Hey, Aurene has her supporters, maybe working with Jormag is the next logical step. XD I dunno just spitballing. Excited to see where we go.
---
I would break it up into 3 steam "clients". Have them be normal, pvp, wvw. Then have each client load directly into the game mode and provide an option to download the other modes (but not auto patch them by default)
---
This would expand those game mode exponentially imo. I wager there are thousands who would be playing those game modes but don't because of pre conceived notions of mmos and how pvp works in mmos.
---
Asura technobabble masterrace
---
Let me check this out once I log in later. My current build is a bit different from yours iirc. Thanks a lot. You gave me few more ideas :)
---
Cilantro and seasame in Kourna. Any desert herb gives those.
---
There are multiple ways to unlock it though. You can get it by playing wvw normally or you can just do wvw dailies and use reward track potions to complete it. You can also do most of the objectives in EotM, I think the biggest roadblock was capturing a keep. The only thing that can't be done in EotM is capturing camps, but that's soloable in any border of your choice.
---
I'd love to be able to solo dungeons for like 1/5th of the rewards you get normally assuming it's scaled down that way. I put off getting tokens until it's the absolute last thing I need in a legendary because finding decent groups is a pain in the ass.
---
Well, there's some precedent from the Jahai release.  Blish is kind of instanced, and appears as a prairie dog or something to everyone else.  I wonder if they could do a similar trick with merchants, to make the NPCs appear arbitrarily small or obviously different to everyone else.
---
Before the fix today, seems the Mint that was dropping consistently, now doesnt. I got 1 out 8 plants. Before patch, everyone was mint. Le sigh
---
I hear the devs were planning to call them:
---
Fun, Stress, Coming "Soon"
---
Aside from the keep, you could get all of the collection playing solo, or with one other person. Also keep in mind that reward track progress is based on participation, and you can keep that at their 6 just by flipping sentries and camps.
---
No it was actually Anet that called it spaghetti code. They even said in an interview every time they add something to the map screen there was a potential fro the whole thing to come down. It wasn't players that came up with the spaghetti code thing. It was Anet themselves on multiple occasions.
---
In all technicality you can ^((but you shouldn't)) run signet sharing, that or any other utility in that util slot where the shout/reflect is, so the slot is fairly free in all aspects
---
Actually, couldn't find more than 7. So AO3 actually has the most.
---
weirdchamp
---
Next will be the Wooden potatoes baloons glider
---
Now would be an excellent time to bring back the marionette fight
---
Please include the part where amorous Charr sound like seven year olds throwing a tantrum.
---
The Charr path of the Gourmet collection gets you the ability to harvest rare meat. You don't actually have to do it playing as a Charr. Same for the Sylvari path for the ability to harvest rare seeds from Herb nodes.
---
Nope, the link wasn't posted yet. Otherwise reddit would have told me.  
---
There is no megathread either. So it is perfectly fine to post it.
---
If you're in awe of mega-servers I guess you haven't done any object-oriented programming.  Instances were a thing before MMOs and PCs.
---
This is NEVER RNG based, it's working code versus broken code.  Proper design technique ensures the 'classic' errors are avoided and retesting is minimized.
---
Not a duplicate post. Maybe you don't like several threads about something but please don't use the term 'duplicate'. I checked before I posted.  
---
Also the direct link I posted is nowhere to be seen either. You reacted too fast.
---
You can even get a keep solo in EotM. Still counts for Warclaw. 
---
Build a golem near a supply depot and use that to knock down gates. It is a long run. Bring a champ solo build and can use golem too if you get in trouble. Very rarely do people defend. 
---
Even easier if you can do with friend(s), but is doable solo for a tough challenge.
---
and different difficulties. please!
---
Just from harvesting when I pass them and doing events whilst achievement hunting and I've hit a 250 stack easy
---
I have a lot of guildies that have been on my trains many times before that are coming to help out with mesmer portals, but of course, the more help the merrier! Bring whatever you feel you want completion on :\]
---
I agree. In my opinion, this is an inappropriate, artificially imposed plot twist.
---
Even a little annoying, in principle, I liked the direction that the upcoming Saga took, I had long wanted to see the development of the Norn theme, the North as a whole in the game, I like the Scandinavian and North European epics .... and bam. This lgbt-content. Ugh damn.
---
I don’t understand why you got a lot of cons.
---
I can’t say that it completely disappointed me, and I won’t go through the plot of the Saga, but it’s a little unpleasant.
---
they don't have the money to do that. FFXIV managed to do it because they had Square Enix to back them up, and that only happened because the MMO name was Final Fantasy, they really didn't want to soil their baby franchise reputation.
---
In GW2 scenario, all the money things game milked from the cash shop was being drained to other failure projects instead of keeping this game alive.
---
because ascended herbs are supposed to be a crafted material rather than a raw one. they blocked a way in which the community was generating these materials for free and made so people actually had to craft them (and we know for sure that the herbs were intended to be crafted from the start since a a seed pouch would only give the owner a single gather of the herb instead of it respawning daily for them).
---
they wanted it to behave exactly like ascended crafting materials like deldrimor ingots and spiritwood planks. you can make a limited amount of them from raw mats each day and if you want more you can either craft them daily or buy them at the trading post for a price that reflects the effort that went into crafting them
---
Nah, I think this needs to be more restricted than that. I prefer 1 seed equals 1 plant for 1 day on 1 account, that means the value of these plants should approach proper ascended level value and be worth the time to harvest and replant daily. If sharing was still a thing in any capacity, the price would never be high enough to make it worth it, *unless* you multiboxed your own plants.
---
Are you still intending on staying EU server only after this? Or will there be an NA server based guild set up
---
Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Season 2 - Into the jungle
---
Season 3 - Spectrum of magic
---
Season 4 - Sand and Storm
---
It is the same annoyance as crafting daily ascended mats so get over it.
---
October 23rd 2015 to January 2016 so 3-4 months ish
---
Yeah, no thanks. I’d rather it worked the way it does now. As far as daily ascended crafts go, it’s now more or less consistent with the way the others work.
---
Reminds me of the Silence from Doctor Who! Love this concept, hope it turns out to be true
---
I think this is a short sighted point of view. They have fixed it now so that in the long run, it should be _more_ profitable for crafters.
---
Doesn't mean it's monthly, but yes, possibly we'll be getting new issues along with new releases of the season/saga
---
The discrepancy between a casual player and hardcore player is massive. One boss may take 2 minutes for one, and 10 seconds for the other. Hence why we want difficulty modes amirite, though I do believe with scaled difficulty there also needa to be scaled rewards, or even exclusive rewards. 
---
Result? We will get a tonne of casuals complaining that it is inacessible like raids and/or that they cant get the rewards solo shitgame/10. Imagine complaining about having a better reward for completing something more difficult. 
---
Welcome to GW2 where QoL and acessibility has sonewhat gotten to the point of ridiculousness where people are basically like complaining that you can't get get "God of PvP" title without actually playing PvP.
---
Ah I missed it!! But happy anniversary OP! And this is really sweet!
---
Introduce a "wandering minstrel" like in FFXIV that unlocks Balthazar (Extreme).
---
Lmao. What is this? Runescape? 
---
imoosrsbettergamethosoznotsoz
---
It's the same point and as a scientist myself I disagree . As I explained there is no way to find the answers to these questions. You have nobody that could give you insights not even aurene except if ascending means gaining knowledge in which case there are alot more important questions first.
---
If you know you can't find the answers to your questions ask different questions.
---
I've seen you in multiple threads posting the same conspiracy theories.
---
I think you're the one with a mental condition.
---
You don't have to buy both expansions - you only need Path of Fire now, it will unlock the other expansion as well.
---
Granted. I was only thinking about the backyard composting. Thanks for the clarification.
---
3/4.  Last would one be rev of course!
---
Season 4: The Crystalline Prophesies
---
The Avatar of the Tree is still not well, this ruckus would not do her any good.
---
They are just being considerate.
---
afk treb SMC from your keep
---
Up until now you have a Living World Season between each expansion (putting aside Season 1 which can't be replayed).
---
A Living World season is composed of several episodes that you can own independently (so you can for example own Season 3 episode 2 but neither episode 1 or 3). They are unlocked for free if you connect in the few months after their release (basically until the next one is released). If you missed them you can always get them back on the gemstore (by whole season or episode, reduction applies if you already had some episodes). They have some story progression, some new open world content, some collections, skins, character enhancements, ways to get gear. Some of them also introduce new stat combo.
---
Season 2 is happening on the Silverwastes and Dry Top (2 maps you have access to even without any expansion) and is a prologue to HoT.
---
Season 3 (requires HoT to buy/play) introduces 1 new map per episode and some new currencies to get ascendend trinket for any stat plus additional masteries mostly applicable in LS3 maps.
---
Season 4 (requires PoF to buy/play) also has the same kind of stuff that Season 3 has but masteries are about enhancing your mount. Season 4 also allows you to unlock 2 new mounts.
---
So for you if you haven't unlocked anything any of those but you have both expansions here is mostly what each season is worth
---
* Season 2: interesting if you want the story bridge between Personal Story/Season 1 and HoT and some easy Tyria Mastery points
---
* Season 3: great for Ascended trinkets and a kind of lifesteal downstate signet (very useful in general PvE)
---
* Season 4: good for the new mounts and the mounts upgrades
---
This sounds awesome! I have a question though. I was planning to catch up on all the expansion content before the icebrood saga begins (I’m just nearing the end of living season 2 content). Is there anything I need to do in heart of thorns in order to join the train? For example, would I be locked out of any sections of the maps because I haven’t done the story content yet? If not I’d love to join the train because it sounds like a cool community get together! Cheers
---
Username checks out
---
I think they are gonna focus on the story to try and rush it until the end then maintenance mode.
---
Lmao put in that mirage incase you roamed a little bit too, but yea full zerk definitely power herald/rev
---
Everybody who owns PoF gets HoT for free, no matter where they buy it.
---
DL Gamer is an approved retailer, so no problem there.
---
Since when is ski the press release for LN? If everything this bad
---
Form me "Crap... so I have to make  ... friends!?" xD.
---
Can anyone tell me if there are any benefits to HoT full map completion?
---
I ask because I will join. But I can bring a character that has quite a bit of the map already done or I can bring a fresh character to get full map unlock and those valuable HP which are annoying to farm.
---
Any advice/tips?
---
They tried being normal during S3/PoF/S4 and it was horrible. I, for one, welcome my new old innovative game developer overlords.
---
Warclaw is really easy to get. Took me 2 days. Was a big easier for me playing a thief, so i could keep up with all the warclaw guys.
---
Reward track is easiest part actually
---
The US vs EU keys actually do make some difference,  it's been a long time since looked this up so my memory is a bit spotty.
---
However, redeeming a key intended for US market by default places the data tied to that account in the US data center while keys for other regions may place that data in EU or US by default depending on the key.
---
However, you can switch region when you first select a server so this is largely inconsequential but afaik it does mean that if you select a non-native region the game should force you to login again as it does when changing region after the fact even though the initial server selection hasn't technically been made.
---
This is from around launch though so the mechanics may have changed since but technically the retail key you purchase is not global initially (i.e. ANet knows which region the key is for they just choose not to do much with that information) not sure how keys bought directly from ArenaNet fit into this though.
---
Such bullshit. Me and my friends often joined random Pugs for fun. Back when any of us still actively played :&gt;
---
It wont happen now that Josh Foreman left Anet
---
Oh look at Mister Fancy over there jerking off to Papa's hidden Playboy while the rest of us plebs had to work with the female underwear part of the clothes catalogue.
---
I'm in, when will we get this?
---
Heads up, whatever that link was is apparently blocked in america.
---
Installed Windows via bootcamp. Fps from 30 -&gt; 60. Huge difference
---
You seem angry.
---
Isn't that exactly what they said in the announcement? IIRC they did say that older masteries will return like mushrooms, updrafts and others...
---
I looked at the transcript in the wiki again and here it is. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
&gt; So then from there we're going to go into some masteries. Z had alluded before that we will be taking existing masteries and bringing them into future content. So expect things like gliding, jumping mushrooms, updrafts, right? But we're also continuing our horizontal progression philosophy by introducing a new mastery line. Starting with episode one. 
---
So it isn't that it could but rather that it will.
---
kinda makes sense they could now HoT is free and we currently the double exp boost goling on.
---
I was very sceptic at first when it said "Consume", didnt know what to expect haha
---
Alright, great info! I see the builds are specific for  all the content, do players have multiple armorsets to do different content? So go raiding with raidgear, then swap armor set to fractals, etc..?
---
Put a sigil of same type in your underwater weapon
---
Actually no. HoT masteries have only been used in episode 6 because we got Melandrus Realm as part of the map.
---
Currently it's a loss until the economy recovers, which could take months, but if you're splitting between 2 or more players. It's worth it. Especially if they donate to offset the cost. This is mostly cost effective for fractals, wvw and raids.
---
I mean, there are mostly 2 supports per squad, no?
---
Also they now have real support food.
---
They tried to do it whenever it made sense, however now they can do it freely since everybody is guaranteed to have access to it.
---
jahai also had a small part of the jungle embedded in the map with updrafts, leylines and mushrooms.
---
It absolutely is do you legitimately think there's like one specific form of autism?  
---
He had been doing shit like that since he was 4yo and still does and the doctors attributed his aggressive behaviour like that to his autism. (He attacked another kid TWICE for having the same superhero shirt as he did so far and pulls similar shit for a wide array of things over the years).  
---
I dare you to go and say that to his parents, which have a TINY bit MORE knowledge on the subject than you do ;)   
---
You may have autism but that doesn't excuse you from such assinine assumptions, stop being an idiot, THAT part IS a choice.
---
And then they forget to deactivate mounts and you simply can fly up. :D
---
So it's finally going to be canon....
---
Well a Canon fanfiction. 
---
I'll take it.
---
This wouldnt neccessarily fix your perceived problem because even unlimited personal merchant/trader express spawns an npc that other players cant interact with but it will still give them the F prompt to use the merchant layed over any other interaction prompt that might be located below it.
---
I can imagine the amount of complaining. sadface.
---
Even in those fillers some of the character development happens so easily, and often completely reversing the character.   
---
That was one of my most hated parts of the show, how characters often just magically forget all their problems and pain and just defeat it all with the power of friendship! In 1 day!!
---
They are called 'feature' not content.
---
We also got updrafts and bouncing mushrooms in Jahai bluffs. However all of them were optional, they never were the only way to reach certain spots.
---
You know how they fixed the nodes to how other accounts can't even hit F on them?  Thats what these NPCs need.
---
WoW is better optimized and does a better job at keeping endgame relevant. Classic is still a very good game if you can overlook the missing quality of life changes.  
---
And keep in mind that GW2 and WoW have a different target audience.  
---
Besides that you said that WoW is garbage and it's like, your opinion, man
---
it's $15 on nuuvem btw. There's a post about it from earlier today.
---
An added tedium to it is that you have to specifically go to your home instance to do it and don't have access to TP or even a cooking vendor there, unlike where you would normally port to whatever home location (Lily of Elon for me) to do crafting and have everything handy in the same place. 
---
So I will correct you in saying it's _exactly_ as tedious.
---
I will take your for it.
---
and thats how it currently is with unlimited express merchants, they cant hit F on them but it still shows up, so they press F and nothing happens except them being blocked to use F on anything that sits below that npc
---
Thank you, Dr. Internet!
---
You can't know for sure the amount of players active on a server in each timezone but the activity amount (the number in brackets) is a decent indicator. This activity number is basically kills and deaths on the server added together during a specific timezone.
---
The playtime that you mention would fit EU and NA EST so you can look for a server with good activity during those timezones.
---
You can check the server you're on by clicking "world selection" bottom left corner of your character selection screen.
---
I miss my Dervish:(
---
amazing bait my friend, well done
---
Also check at r/GuildRecruitment - Good Luck!
---
You're really helping prove my point by sending 2 canned responses in a row.
---
Damn remember having to capture elite skills?
---
Idle for 5 years... you did nothing for 5 years?
---
Nah, get what you mean, welcome back! :D
---
Cilantro has been more than enough for me for a general use power food and is pretty easy to farm as well.
---
ahh didn't know that this Subreddit exists, I'm kinda new to reddit.   
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
Nightfall didn’t do that at all. It took a couple hours tops and you were level 20, full set of heroes. Factions though, that was an experience about half way through in Kaineng.
---
You could craft [Quiche of Darkness Vegetable Mix
---
](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quiche_of_Darkness_Vegetable_Mix), it's part of the [The Minstrel I: The Experimental Focus
---
](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Minstrel_I:_The_Experimental_Focus) collection. Nearly no cost, if you have [Indigo Mushrooms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Indigo_Mushroom), and it gets you about 2 ranks pre craft iirc (17 got me from around 460 to 500)
---
And to be fair, as much as I like Josh for his work, his jumping puzzles really aren’t the best in the game. 
---
The chalice of tears is kind of try hard in its desire to inflict frustration.
---
Is there any difference between that and GW2 raids, we're still waiting a long time either way. :')
---
The issue is that ‘personal merchants’, the ones that no one can use except the owner, also still give Anyone the ability to hit f. If you are not the owner it blocks you from accessing the merchant’s services but still super annoyingly allows you to interact with the dead end, potentially blocking nodes, chests, etc.
---
The builds on snowcrows.com actually use dps food on the dps/support hybrids, boon food on chrono and heal food on healers. Whoever plays the least dps-focused builds will be at a huge disadvantage relative to dps players regardless.
---
No endurance regen option either so mirage is also screwed.
---
No interesting food effects added, just boring 10% defensive powercreep. No properly modular design to reduce list/recipe bloat.
---
&gt; Also they now have real support food.
---
You mean [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Pastry), [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Nopalitos_Saut%C3%A9), [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plate_of_Eggs_Benedict), [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Poultry_Satay) or [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plate_of_Mussels_Gnashblade)? Or the rice balls we're had for ages?
---
But I did, not at the very end for the color, because it's more hard to put the colors after that
---
But I'm still learning this technique, it's my second painting with greyscale
---
And zhanks !
---
None lmao
---
I've been playing since 2013
---
Well I sure hope so, because without an expansion - or expansion-level content - the game sure can't go on with just Living world.
---
Because something people don't consider is that there's nice and rude people all over the planet, regardless of the rando MMO they play. I personally haven't experienced anything better than usual in GW2, people helping newbies in-game is happening in every game
---
Due to unhappiness in the toxic community regarding stacking sigils we decided to remove them from the game. 
---
-Anet next balance patch in 6 months
---
Are we really complaining that a force of nature not having a gender is identity politics? 
---
It's not politics unless you *make* it politics.
---
But what about my free lifeforce after 5 minutes?
---
I wager the solution OP wants is have the unlimited vendors do something similar to how Collector's Edition Sandstorm works.  That just opens the vendor window directly, nobody else can interact with it, and it even stays open no matter how much you move around.
---
&gt; I had 80 guys wanting to go in after our guild missions . Took me more then 2h.
---
80 guys would have generated at least 960 herbs without any gathering boni and without any upfront costs of sowing the seeds themselves. 
---
Even at only 50s per herb, that would have meant 480g value for 2 hours harvesting for you and 6 minutes for everybody else.
---
And you are seriously complaining about the fact that you have to spent 2h in game for it?
---
When you're filled with rage to the point that you can't think straight, it's easier to use a canned response than to try coming up with one yourself.
---
I'm really hoping they bring back the living story season 1 bosses (Scarlett &amp; Marionette) back as strike missions
---
The whole damn thing has been implemented poorly, and without thought.
---
So poorly in fact that it's already had to be patched.
---
So utterly poorly that you could loot e.g. leeks in someone else's home instance, come back to yours and find that 5-20g worth of ascended plots you planted are now open soil.
---
Not to mention the fact that the whole system relies on a regular supply of crappy food that no-one wants, to be salvaged.  There's no particular faucet for most of those foods so they were wallowing on the TP for years.  Now they're being eaten up.  Quite soon you're going to be nuking a few gold's worth of crap to get a seed pouch and that's going to massively drive up the price of the cultivated seeds.
---
Cultivated seeds are easy going to be 5g+ in a few months.
---
ok, thanks for the info
---
Not mostly, all of it.
---
It takes 5 hours at most and you dont even need zergs to do all this stuff. You can cap bigger objectives in off hours with a couple of players or just go to EotM and do the same.
---
Joe Rogan
---
My my, what wonderful Mordrem meat curtains you have
---
Very common in AB. Trolls pop merchants so you can't interact with the chests. It makes no sense why I'm able to click on the merchant if he won't offer me any services. It's the same with those stupid NPC's that walk around the bank in LA. Such a simple fix but ANet just won't fix it. It's been like that for years.
---
So much this, just some overscaled legendary open world bosses, or a safari of legendary bountys or anything.
---
Raiders really don't need these shiny great looking wings, take old assets slap some unique mechanics on them done
---
That would also be fine. Perfectly balanced.
---
you shouldn't even compost anything already cooked. compost is for uncooked stuff, at least that's the rule where I live. no idea why though, maybe because animals or something, I just know I should only to put leftover ingredients or scraps from peeling etc into the compost.
---
It would add zero value to the game. It’s wasted time for devs. This game is so fucking alt friendly, just create another Charakter. Ffs you can even keep your old gear.
---
So when do we get the gemstore item to craft 3x ALL timegated materials.
---
I mean it's only fair, lets fatten the ArenaNet coffers as we fade into the sunset.
---
Exalted exist in places where a glint dragon egg resides, there could be a few locations throughout the world, whether or not there would still be exalted or other baby dragons in them is unknown.

I dont see any mention of that in the patch notes and the wiki also doesnt state that all unlimited tools have 4 instead of 3 swings per node.
---
My guees is that the 4 swings were also unintended behaviour and it got fixed at some point. The patch notes i linked mention this though:
---
&gt; Fixed an issue in which the Chop-It-All Logging Axe applied an unintended enhancement when gathering.

"but Gold to Gem prices have been steadily increasing over the past year." 
---
More like since 2013, back in 2012 you could easily buy 400 gems for 2g, if memory serves me right.
---
Not a bad idea. Even 3-5 days would be nice.
---
I wouldn’t even mind manually planting every day, if I could load directly into my home instance from the load screen. It’s annoying that we need to first load into the city map, then load into our instance.
---
&gt;that was an experience about half way through in Kaineng.

Saying Factions was a hell of a leveling experience compared to the other campaigns is both accurate and an understatement, lol. My friends (all Lv20) tried to escort my first character from the docks to Kaineng City to get him better armor ASAP. I was probably level 13ish at most, yet I was the only one to actually live the whole trip there.
---
They could introduce a "role queue" that many other games use, where you queue up as tank, dps or healer.
---
Do you remember how expanions were announced? At the end of Living Story. Why did you expect an expansion if anet officialy said "LS5 will come right after LS4" and we didn't have any announcement?
---
No content - BAD  
---
New content - BAD
---
What's wrong with you?
---
Or Crystal and Resonance, seeing as all its minions shared a ressonance and that was supposed to be its weakness.
---
&gt; The other is a politicized contemporary trend *made up* by tumblr, which is why it is politics.
---
This statement alone says enough, I think, about your angle on this, so I'll leave this discussion here.
---
only few people would argue about many aspects of the WC being poorly designed. however the mount isn't necessary to catch up to your zerg for the most of the important moments.
---
99cm is not raid difficulty
---
They said during the presentation that there will be a public mode and a mode for preformed squads, so it's save to assume that the dragonbash arena was a test for this technology. And going off that the public mode might be tuned to be easier than the preformed quad one (for the later there wouldn't be any need to scale either).
---
Dude, you're "filled with rage" that a fictional being that's described as a force of nature hasn't been given a male or female pronoun, and accusing that entire gender identity of being narcissists and liars. 
---
 Take a step back, calm down, and maybe stop commenting if you're too angry to do so politely.
---
I really don't understand why we should worry about this now. It's a dragon. Female or male doesn't really matter much. It would be could if Jormag would end up being a female tho. since the Jormag followers don't accept females on their coult!
---
Yeah, but at least on EU I don't have that problem, as the pug community is still very active. I think that problem is just a side effect of the low population and maybe not necessarily being weekly. 
---
I think daily stuff belongs to fractals. Having raids and fractals being daily, just to get those done, would 3-4 hours a day with a good group. Not to mention all the other daily stuff you already have going on.
---
I argued with a friend yesterday that I (currently) don't see this as an issue because you can share your instance&amp; it's tradeable, now it kinda stings because that's at least similar to allowing you to craft multiple asc crafting cooldowns via a gemstore upgrade. 
---
It may not have the same effect as crafting 3 Lumps of Mithrillium&amp; other each day (at least right now) because it's more niche than asc gear so people won't view it as serious, but steps like that always worry me.
---
No-mount-zones could feel weird, but there could be really steep climbs but with updrafts next to them, so you can either fiddle around with recharging your skyescale or finding bits with the springet to land on or… take the comfy updraft or even layline.
---
Does anyone know when the heart of thorns promotion ends? Thanks!
---
Good point.
---
I sure liked the addition of a headline feature like mounts. And I'd really like some new elite specs.
---
Basically new ways to experience the game's world. Not just more of the world.
---
Probably one of the main selling points of the Home Instance Portal Stone
---
Watch it, SSGSS Goku is badass
---
never.
---
Yeah, but my time is limited and I don't want to waste too much effort on looking for every coined-up bullshit term people come up with on a day-to-day basis.
---
&gt;Roughly every two year we get an expansion followed by a living world season.
---
We waited for 3 years for HoT, which was preceded as well as followd by almost  a year of no content.
---
So the "every two year" gap between boxes happend one single time!
---
Also: how do you estimate that the saga will be half of the content a theoretical expac would have been? Thats oddly specific.
---
On top of that: if they were going to release an expac by this September they would have started with that 2 years ago. From all we know (which is not much) that does not seem to have been the case.
---
That would be sad but at least another batch of newer players will have loads to do and maybe some of the vets would return.
---
No, I went for autism handicap straight away.
---
Just another theory: what if the strike missions wont scale? They can be designed for 5 players with about fractal tier4 difficulty, but you can enter up to 10 players. So if you are good you can have your tier4 level challenge with 5 players but if you are too casuals you can enter with 10 players getting the same diffculty as the if it would be 5 players. Everyone can have his level of challenge. If this will happen then I hope the rewards will scale, more players doing it giving less rewards.
---
I think they wont be designed for 10 players challenging, cause it will have a public mode, as Dragon Bash Arena was, where basicly you can sign up (without setting up your role) and you will get an instance with fully random players with random gear level (even with green-blue-rare stuffs), random openworld builds. You may have a squad with no healer or boon supporter or you may have too many of them (less group dps). So I think there wont be dps check parts, no enrage timer, no lethal attacks, no complicated team mechanics (cause number of players isnt fixed, all mechanics will affect about 1-2 players or all the players at once).
---
it was sharing. listing your HI on the LFG is now regarded as "distribution of goods", and as such not allowed. whether or not your LFG has a pricetag on it is irrelevant to anet.
---
Normally you can't even sell it for that price, unless they missed some items when they applied this. If buy or sell order * 0.85 is below the vendor price the sell button is greyed out.
---
By that logic the LS maps count as PoF content too. You always need the newest box for most of the new content coming out.
---
Raids and fractals were explicitly not named as featured content during the PoF announcement.
---
Wouldn't that mean you still have to load into whatever map then use the portal stone? Usually, you leave an alt in a city or do gathering and such in a home instance
---
Yes, that exp boost event is why I’m finally getting off my butt and making my way to the PoF content, and inspired my question. Thanks for the reminder on the consumables!
---
Yes, because this was planned more than a year earlier, possibly two years beforehand. (But it was revealed to us in mid 2018)
---
Thanks for telling me about the Adventures!

Migthyteapot is and was always a good streamer that really loves and understands the game. I just wished he didnt feeded and created a community around him soo focused in toxicity and memes.

---
what skin is your chestpiece?
---
I would suggest for you to tell all this new players that come in to the game now and those that just got HoT that they need to work hard on their masteries because they will need it in season 5. Arena Net said so, and i think that a lot of players never watched the event or read here on reddit, and you have a exelent position to inform them about it so they really understand that it have a impact if they don't have it.
---
Yea... the casual everyday playerbase grouping up other 9 ppl for "hard mode" mini-raid, sounds about right. Fuck everything else, the biggest problem is the loot that will be rewarded, if it's gonna be 3 blues and 1 green+ like 2 ectos gg with doing the new "content" with 2 parties....
---
I think I saw that 2 years ago here.
---
Still a cool icicle axe.
---
I like that Zhaitan's weakness is effectively poor management skills. Had he gone on a HR training course, the world would have been a very different place.
---
You need to log into a character and use the portal stone. Double clicking it again brings you back to your location (most likely excluding WvW/ instances like fractals, guild hall). It doesn't matter where your character is when you first use it.
---
I understand the fall behind thing and i get that it can feel frustrating but it do not take long to get the mount at all. In fact imo it is way to easy. And i can say that because i have many alt accounts in which i done the mount and it wont take you more then a few hours of game time. 
---
And no it should not be unlocked in other game modes that is ridiculous. It is a WvW mount, it is designed for that purpose.
---
Agreed
---
[Nice repost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7xyhr7/finally_got_my_frostfang_d/)
---
there is a long debate where the name originally came from and since GW1 actually starts right after "The Guild Wars" in 1070AE in pre searing I would be more inclined to say that this is the origin of the name instead of one of several game modes that were present in the game.
---
I like how ppl are kinda on the defence while not knowing the cooking market was literally being swept and destroyed by a massive deflation all because of how cheap, efficient and sharable the asc feasts were.
---
It’s when I see shit like this, I realise I have no artistic skills. Where do you even begin when crafting a desk lamp hahaha,
---
Looks absolutely amazing good stuff.
---
Or you could buy a new character slot and get a new character. Farm for gold and you don't even have to pay money for it. And the one that you don't play can be a bank mule or placed at the end of something or at a garden and give you slow gold. And when the year pass by you also get birthday presents.
---
And getting heropoints, there are a shit ton of hero points that are just comune. It will take you roughly an hour or maybe two and then that is done. Or if you play WvW just go and buy them.
---
His stage very buggy and filled with trashmobs leading to him. Not really a good content to rerun.
---
Im like 90% sure I've seen this before
---
Princess is the only one I have, and I'll go check out those collections the next time I'm on, thanks!
---
The problem is that there are extremes on both ends.  I had the Warclaw within 15mins of the patch going live, so I could argue that it doesn't take too long to acquire, provided you have 80 potions of WvW reward on hand, and a commander leading players on a PPT run to get all the components.
---
ANET should just put a vendor in so new players can rent a base Warclaw while they are working on their collection.  But they can't even figure out how to implement ascended cooking right, so clearly my expectations of their abilities is unrealistic
---
it should still have been mentioned on the wiki if that was ever the case
---
Can't buy this because I'm in Australia... So guttered.
---
Or maybe just maybe people love to complain on the internet and ANET dropped the ball so hard it fell through the floor.

I mean, really—why would you think creating a new account just to try to take credit for someone else’s work would be a good idea?
---
* "Fury" as in "fury of the storm" I guess. Might even be synonymous with "storm" or "chaos" considering we don't have a properly codified hard magic system.
---
* "Conflagration" might be a poetic term for the planet's mantle (or whatever shape the lava deep down actually takes, we have globes but I don't recall any direct in-world evidence of a spherical planet); maybe it's just an extra ability for the fire to *spread* and envelop non-combustible materials.
---
* Zhaitan's "shadow" domain actually fits pretty well both literally and metaphorically: on the literal side we see the skies darken as its minions approach and areas become corrupted, the Risen have plenty of dark animations and like to hide out in caves. On the metaphorical side the Risen use a lot of stealth and subterfuge from playing dead and regular ambushes to the LA scouts to *sailing an entire friggin' armada UNDERWATER* to attack Claw Island. And while a bit of a stretch its workings as a quasi-hivemind seeing through the Eyes and feeding through the Mouths, combined with the appearance of the *Shadow* of the Dragon as Mordy's champion after Zhaitan's death can also be understood as seeing a direct image, the "shadow", of the dragon itself embodied in its champions.
---
The part about salvaging low value food is actually great design. It gives value to foods people craft to lvl up cooking or get in festival bags. 
---
A meaningful cooking system needs a lot of craft able food choices, but there were never going to be hundreds of valid food options. Now all of this has some inherent value, similar to how regular salvaging gives value to trash drops.
---
And this also increases the value of trick or treat bags and winters day presents, which is fun.
---
I was kinda sure i'd seen it as well, so i did some google-foo :

I'd agree with the OP except the seed drop rate is to low.  I did have fun farming choice cuts of meat, running around on my LB Ranger (using 'The Hunter' title) farming neutral Dolyaks, Sheep and Stags.  But the bottleneck is clearly the seeds, since I could farm 10 meat in 5 mins but not see a single seed on the entire map.
---
All in all, not worth the effort. Ill just stick to my regular  foos
---
Yes, ir was here before. OPs acc is 3 days old so they most likely just stoled it.
---
I mainly PvP but I didn't mind that comment. I think the sub is blowing that a bit out of proportion.
---
You're welcome - I've hit the same wall with the game a few times, but the more traditional quests helped give me something to work towards. If you find any more, let me know...
---
I *might* even start work on a second legendary weapon at some stage but that's a bigger thing and the grind is real.
---
I bought a lot of keys there and i can sure you works on both EU and NA servers (have accounts on both) NUUVEM is the official brazillian reseller of gw2.
---
So first off, condi DPS is not meta in fractals. You're better off with a different build (like [alacrity renegade](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade)). Condi renegade can be very strong in raid encounters where you have more time to ramp up damage but fractals wants more burst damage to phase faster and cleave down adds. 
---
That being said there are many good options for gearing, I'd recommend this guide: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character which has many ways to get both ascended and exotic gear. My recommendation is to focus on getting your trinkets first (which will will account for up to 10 infusion slots or 90AR with +9 infusions). Trinkets account for a lot of your stats and are an easy way to start with AR while armor accounts for very little (2-3%) and is harder to get. Weapons are also important since they up the base weapon damage for power builds. If you do still want to go condi just [follow a build](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for what you want and use the gearing guide to get the stats you need, there are a bunch of stat selectable options now that you can pick from that have little to no cost.

Dragon lore is a mess, being made up as needed per episode. Remember devs admitted they dont even have elder dragon origins decided yet? Ya know, the main plot or their game.
---
This so much. People troll with it for years and years. And i don't mean those that place it for use but those that place for trolling. May it be close to a object you need or a portal for reset at WvW. I don't know how many players that missed reset because of this. And since there is technology for it then way keep on feeding trolls with trollish items. Make the personal one invisible just like the one in WvW or the one you get from ecto gamble and so on.
---
you have it in your post. People do care more about rewards than about challenging themselves, thus creating CMs for anything is wasted dev time.
---
REEEEEEEEEEPOST!
---
And at WvW portals on reset so that you miss reset because of 3-4 hours of queue. That makes a lot of players very unhappy because they get blocked from their game mode and reset is important for most dedicated WvW players.
---
Yeah these are some good explanations. Thanks!
---
It is not a must, but if I like to play with the zerg I should be able to stay with the zerg with less struggle as possible until I have the mount, and running or using running skills (maybe in cooldown when I get to the zerg and startiting the fight) is annoying. Everybody is suggesting to do all but zerging until you get the mount, and this imho is a bad design.
---
Tbf mordy spoke in hot as well.
---
That burn made the earth two degrees hotter
---
great community btw.
---
A fierce looking charr fanart. Now this is rare.
---
&gt; It's exactly as tedious as making the Mithrillium for Ascended Ingots. I don't understand why people are bitching so much about this. Ascended mats have had a daily time-gate since they've been introduced.
---
Because it isn't exactly the same.
---
What do I need to do to make a lump of mithrillium?  Have Mithril Ore + vendor mats + crafting station in any zone 
---
What do I need to do to make an ascended peppercorn seed?
---
Have peppercorn seed (rng drop) + food to salvage for extract + vendor mats + plot in your home instance
---
Exactly the same?  Hardly.  Not once have I ever not had mithril to turn into mithrillium, but I currently have no peppercorn seeds as RNG has not been with me.
---
Thanks! I'll test it tonight.
---
&gt; Kind of surprised it's not a thing yet.
---
fractals? this is still a thing?
---
we already learn all the mechanics 1 hour after the raid release so what's the difference tbh
---
Why is it unfortunate. It’s a WvW focused mount that only has value in WvW. It gets out classed by all other mounts.
---
 If you want it you have to play WvW. That’s not unfortunate, it’s by design.
---
I honestly had no intention of using this food outside of WvW, and even then, only for the 10% WvW XP buff.  I don't raid, and I don't do T4 CMs, but even if I did, both were on farm mode long before ascended food - it isn't as if ascended food is now all of a sudden going to make you more successful than you were before.
---
I have about 40 feasts in my bank now, and when there is a double XP week event up where I know there will be massive XP farming, I'll break out the feasts.  But for now, so long as things remains as they are, I'll just be ignoring ascended food as it isn't worth the effort.
---
Lol season names or trends of GW2?
---
I wish there was a poop award on reddit. I would give it to you.
---
Ah yes, the good faith arguments "tumblr made it up" and "they're doing it all for attention anyway!!1!1!!"
---
Not sure I understand the joke. It sounds like you're complimenting a girl on how quickly she can do an extremely elaborate hair style.
---
Yes.
---
Yes. I agree.
---
Why would they drop an expansion, that we would need to buy, and give parts of it away for free in the living world format?
---
And by the way... They never said that they are working on Expac 3 after PoF. People are messing up things... They did say that LW4 will begin shortly after PoF and it did. And 6 months after PoF dropped, they had their big 6th year announcement that LW5 will begin after LW4 ends.
---
those builds are all S-Tier worthy imo
---
https://www.godsofpvp.net/
---
Its called extra accounts ;)
---
Why would you want a weekly cap? It's the worst that could happen
---
Most of the builds you use in raids can be used for pretty much every PvE content (sometimes one or two armor pieces get replaced for optimization, but that is not necessary for anything but the most min-maxed stats).
---
I disagree, they are best of respective classes. But not all of them S. Scourge for example is definitely A-tier.
---
Lol this is a reposted top comment as well?! This is next level shit from Reddit that I can't believe is a thing.
---
To be fair: PoF introduced a whole continent of Elonian people. It made sense to give them distinct hair and faces. There weren't any Sylvari living in the Maguuma jungle, so there was no reason to give new Sylvari look.
---
... just from that perspective. Of course it would have made sense to give Mordrem style Sylvari hair to players.
---
Yup! The staff and the shield are amazing.
---
Shit is this guy just reposting like crazy?!
---
This is so good!! Do you post your art anywhere?
---
It's such a small "troll" in the first place, why does anyone even give a shit?
---
Just click on the damn chest and THEN press F.
---
There's no reason to ban anyone or take away their ability to make someone have to MAYBE execute a SINGLE additional click, like what the fuck how is this even an issue.
---
By participating in a reddit thread like this, anyone who typed a comment has put hundreds if not thousands of times the effort of one additional click, you could get "trolled" by this for months or years until you've poured the same amount of additional "work" into this troll as a simple reddit comment requires.
---
GW1 is a totally different game with 2.200 skills you can mix and match however you want. The dual class system and Hard Mode Map completion also does it's part. I mean... You spend like 40h for one story playthrough starting in Proph, Factions, Nightfall and EotN. And after you completed all of this, you unlock all Hardmodes and can do it again but with a much higher difficulty. You can spend up to 200 hours to get all skills for one Character, depending on how efficient you are with capturing signets.
---
Comparing GW1 with GW2 is not really possible.
---
I don't believe any class/build is S-tier by your definition - if you're winning in 1v2 the 2 are probably bad players or running terrible builds.
---
Story line and 3d assets easily could have been repurposed. If you spend money creating assets and end up scrapping the project it makes sense to use what was created in other stuff
---
In fact we've already seen this happen with utopia architecture being repurposed as asura architecture
---
Nothing new AFAIK.
---
The same ol' pick Human, Warrior/Thief (or any others you pref), raised by common folk, level 10, do quest line.
---
Which is still harder than it would have been without the NPC.
---
I love it !
---
Dont know my schedule yet, but i hope i can make it. I had fun the last time ( first time) i joined your train.
---
They canceled 2 Projects. We actually don't know on how many projects Arena Net was working. It could have been 1 new IP and 2 mobile games for example.
---
I play on20-30 fps in hot/pof zones
---
Thanks for your opinion, I would like it was true.
---
You always had to wait 4 days before being able to use the tp or send mail on newly upgraded accounts.
---
It could be, but it is highly unlikely considering that NCSoft had to step in and tell Arena Net to focus on GW2 again. GW2 was running on a skeletal crew and it showed. Even without all of the additional information around the layoffs. I mean... We only had 2 new fractals release within the last 1.5 years and 3 new raids. There was a 9 month gap between the underworld and the mystic forge raid. Nothing in the world can explain to my why it took so long, except for the fact that only a couple of people were working on this content.
---
Arena Net was not working for their full potential. And it showed... There was no expansion planned before the layoffs. Maybe they are thinking about it now, but with LW5 in between, we won't know for sure until end of next year. Maybe...
---
Or so that .. I cant remmeber every node cost in every point. I know that we were waiting for a long time because we didnt had gold for it and then my sweetheart bought that node for me.
---
Yeeees please!! I love customizing and it’s been ages since new hair.

Feel like my azura has so little to choose from :(

LET HER HAVE BRAIDS like the big ladies!!! And bangs!!
---
There is few specific spots that rain seeds on you. Alt depended though.
---
Log in, get daily reward, log out. Repeat for 4 months, play story and new map for 2 hours. Back to login rewards.
---
They might even have started a second table by now. Or third.
---
The first part that was patched, absolutely agreed.
---
But the 2nd part of the post I disagree with heavily, ye crappy food that has been piling up for ages is gonna be used up and gain SOME value, but that's a very good thing, it's gonna add some value to the tons of useless gathered materials so people and especially new players can feel a lot better about gathering some random leeks or w/e, instead of going "wow, 3 copper".
---
Prices for garbage food still arn't going to rise astronomically and you're forgetting the tons of random event food which, even at a point where the event has been like 10 months ago, was still completely worthless (before cooking 500).
---
There's always gonna be cheap enough food to salvage, and there's always gonna be someone crafting it, or some event shitting out tons of it.
---
"When it's done"
---
Queen Jennah is that you?

Does this make anyone else’s skin crawl and give you the heebie jeebies?
---
We are still EU based. We just accept now non german speaking players.
---
i think some devs didn't think about replayability
---
&gt; I likened Kralky Talky's "fury" trait to his method of attack throughout his current recorded history. His movement patterns were mostly based on attacking a specific person (or dragon, in Aurene and Glint's case) rather than attacking indiscriminately.
---
Based on what we're *told* this no longer really applies post-PoF. Brandstorms and later the Rifts are said to appear all over the place.
---
Mordy also doesn't fit because while the Dream was his seat of power his actual corruption and physical influence spread rather mindlessly as vines slurping up magic.
---
You spelled 'best' wrong &lt;3

Thank you!

Do it like the rest of us grown-ups and bury you hopes and dreams in the back yard. Bonus points if you do it during a dark and rainy night...

---
Do the hearts, some of them are really fast!The more characters you have at lv 80 the better(you can do the same hearts multiple times).Also try downloading TACO with the lws4 routes for farming map currency.
---
I was just like you at the beginning, then I figured all the above and collected all the currencies really fast - 2-3 days, playing for around two hours each.
---
Running around mining nodes that have a 1 in 5 per node chan e to contain any of the currncy is pretty demoralizing. Add on top the fact that the events barely give any as well, I jist put the game on hold until I'm closer to my goal
---
When did you talk to them about that? How long ago?
---
Which is why to troll, I spam consumables around the chest so people can't click on it with banners, permanent merchant, and a portal on top (and mimic) for extra salt.

The secondary aspects were brought out in LS2 as a way to explain why the plant dragon could do psychic things, and it actually answered some questions about how Zhaitan worked too. If you were paying attention with Mordremoth at all in LS2 and HoT, you also saw it stealing Zhaitans power with the shadow dragons and stuffing the dead full of plants to reanimate, like its dracolich sibling. It wasn't something they initially planned, but I don't think it hurts to have brought in, and it gives them more design space with the dragons, so I have no complaints.
---
I also think they never had reason to cook up origins for the elder dragons because, much like the gods in  GW1, it wasn't relevant to the story beyond a vague description of where they seemed to come from. There is no in universe reason we would know where they came from given how old they are, their unwillingness to talk to us, and their tendency to genocide everything on sight. I honestly think they are just touching on that plot thread for kralkatorrik and aurene more than any other dragons, but even if a story element wasn't planned out initially it can still end up good. 99% of GW1 and most iteratively developed stories make new things up as they go, with only a vague overarching idea of what direction to take things. I would honestly say 100% of all stories with xpacs are like that, but there are probably the rare exceptions.
---
In pve you can spend a long time in one map.  
---
In wvw you are sometimes changing maps every few minutes, depending on what you are trying to do.
---
My guess is that the current implementation was a result of the overall garden plot implementation. Every player instanced mechanic requires columns be added to a data table somewhere and all signs point to the daily "gathered" flag being separate from the garden plots themselves.
---
Implementing a charge based system might need an overhaul of the existing garden plots to avoid edge cases.
---
I haven't done the math, but it might be more profitable to plant regular nodes rather than re-crafting ascended ones.
---
Feather warband or foot warband?
---
/u/rude_asura knows about this
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Yikes. Also why is ArenaNet weird with the way they handle streams and such? I know they didn't even help promote the last big community raiding event
---
Who? Never heard of this spongeous guy.
---
Good, he sounds childish and salty judging from that tweet. No wonder WvW was going downhill past few years.
---
Who?
---
Not being snarky. I actually have no idea who that is.
---
Didn't teapot have a similar reaction to Jaw's?
---
yes I meant HoT is free with PoF
---
Re: Jormag: 'to snow' means 'to deceive'. :3
---
Who? 😂
---
OK, what about supporting GvG tournaments?  Or PvP tournaments?  Or any other community event.  What about paying more attention to WvW and PvP instead of getting next to zero content?  Oh right, that stuff doesn't align with your argument so might as well ignore it.
---
Yes apologies I missed that from my sentance. Serves me right typing before Coffee :)
---
No. 
---
Big Nose Ted still goes first, Uptown Johnny is still Man plus and that, Soldier, is still a threat.
---
Supporting the game doesn't mean that you have to agree with everything that is out there. There is a difference between constructive criticism and destructive criticism. Anet took it in a wrong way. There are so many partners silently quitting the game that didn't get kicked out of the partner programme.. Being vocal AND telling the truth is very hard to accept.
---
I doubt most of those people have tried to monetize their departure though.
---
And people say hardcore players are toxic.  The amount of people laughing and attacking Jaw is unbelievable.  I see more toxic casual open world players than toxic hardcore players.  You open worlders are savage.  It's like you have nothing better to do than to attack content creators.
---
4K hours of playtime and I feel quite comfortable with most classes. Here's my top classes/builds based on game type:
---
Open World: Power Herald, Condi Renegade, Power DH, Power or Condi Warrior (my main profession), Power SB, Power Holo, Power DD or DE, Power Tempest, Power Necro
---
Instanced PvE: Power or Condi Warrior, Power DH, Condi Renegade, Condi DD, Power Tempest or Weaver, Condi Scourge, Power Reaper
---
PvP: Condi Bomb Scourge, Power Reaper, Support Tempest, Power Herald
---
WvW: Firebrand, Power Herald, Support/Power Scourge, Power Holo, Condi Mirage
---
Why shouldn't you be able to get asc from strike missions? You do from fractals. They are approprietly priced. You do from open world. You get them from achievments. Ascended is not some special reward but it would help a lot especially if anet want to be new player friendly.
---
Token system is good I agree but why *I* want rng is simply because it feels more rewarding.
---
Also daily vs weekly. I think weekly is healthier. I don't want to do 3 hours of dailys every day. Dungeons are actually fairly lucritive. More so than fractals actually...why aren't people dpoing them? No, it's not the bugs... i think if they boosted dungeon token reward 4x and made it weekly instead of daily, dungeons would get more mainstream. Same logic applies here. People don't play the game 10 hours a day. I mean, SOME do. Other points I can't argue/don't see the point.
---
did they try to make their leave as noisy as jawgeous did though?
---
Most of their partners today don't even play the game much, if at all.
---
Post PoF is kind of an anomaly because a lot of his behavior is altered due to absorbing magic he wouldn't normally have access to; rifts wouldn't have even been an issue had he not absorbed Balthazar's magic. The argument could be made that Kralk's "fury" was initially very focused on specific individuals, and further expanded to all mortal races as he was driven more insane by the incompatible magic he was absorbing. 
---
Mordy fits better than you suggest, because his early attacks benefited him in more ways that just base instinctual magic absorption. He specifically targeted waypoints, which were known to tap into the magical ley-line network across Tyria, which no other dragon seems to do despite being aware of ley-line magical energy. He also targeted settlements and mortal strategic footholds, showing an awareness of strategy that wouldn't necessarily be a huge payoff of magical absorption. 
---
His corruption also wasn't purely plant based, as his main method of taking over and controlling his minions *was* mind control. There are a couple instances where humanoid mordrem were able to fight off his mind control and regain control of their senses, despite still showing the physical characteristics of other mordrem.
---
Of course, everything is muddled by the deaths of the Elder Dragons and the surviving dragons absorbing magic that they wouldn't ordinarily have access to, which is creating new abilities that weren't always available to them before. Despite this, I still think this is a theory that holds some weight, but again it's still just a theory. It seems as though they have some plans for Jormag that will complicate the intentions of the ED's further, so there may be some more clarification as the story continues.
---
Rework Dungeons into Strike Missions!!!
---
I mean I just checked Jawgeous video summary after the stream, here are the main points:
---
\- PvP content had only 20 seconds of coverage
---
\- Saga is just living world episodes with different name. So there is nothing new.
---
\- PvE maps don't have replayability.
---
\- PvPers already knew about swiss tournaments coming over year ago
---
\- He was disappointed with the announcement in general
---
\- Anet doesn't give shit about PvP and mocks it. Their actions "rub shit under PvPers noses".
---
\- He was disappointed in general and is happy about not playing the game anymore. He found the announcement abusive and pathetic.
---
\- He thought more exciting would have been: Dungeons and raids with difficulty modes, PvP games modes and better incentive for WvW.
---
After that Youtube played WoodenPotatoes doing review on it who said exactly the same, he hated the announcement and that if Sagas don't do it for you, you're gonna feel bad.
---
I don't myself watch Jawgeous because I don't think he is particularly great at PvP or funny but he was one of the content creators that put most effort in the game. And he actually was right, the announcement was terrible for anyone that plays repeatable content (PvP, WvW, Dungeons, Raid content etc.) for it being streamed around the time when next expansion would have originally been planned to come out.
---
jaw is swimming alone at sea while you conformist trendfucks are following the school right into the net. you disgust me.
---
Reset Anomaly. Dailies. Farm quartz in dry top. Octovine. Junudu Rising. ARock and Doppleganger. Forged in Fire. Matriarch in VB. Gerent. Home farm and daily crafting. Farm Secret Garden and flax. Then maybe farm some herbs and quality meat until Pinata. After that it’s either bed time or I do WvW or dungeons or whatever.       
---
Friday nights is raids, Sunday nights is guild missions. At some point before reset I do a weekly key farm.      
---
I probably log on about 5x a week? Sometimes more, sometimes less.
---
If SM's (Strike Missions) are good then it sounds like this is a good step towards instanced boss content for Guild Missions, bringing back life into doing the boring and repetitive crap... I can only dream. Q-Q
---
And about your point! This would be a fantastic feature for Mordremoth or MoM, or a different HoT boss I can't think of now. This kind of feature shouldn't stay with new content. :)
---
&gt; Yeh anet doesnt want hardcore players. 
---
So?  You are saying it is if it were a negative thing.  There are plenty of titles out there that are obviously targeted towards hardcore players.  As GW2 never has given any indication of this, but rather the opposite, what is the issue?
---
Is it noisy if other people post his videos and messages here?
---
*Orphans cheer for Keyfarm Character.*      
---
Same ol, same old.
---
WHOMEGALUL?
---
Really? It's an old song that was a bit of a hit in the nineties.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didi_(song)
---
How many run throughs did that take btw, since the recorded run was pretty flawless from what I saw?
---
He said he quit GW2, kept a highly negative attitude towards the game in general and is an absolute nobody.
---
Up until he quit, maybe a handful of people knew of him, if even. 
---
Reactions and snarky remarks like this tweet's last phrase
---
&gt;Just delete PvP &amp; WvW and tell your bedtime stories.
---
are what ultimately got him the boot. 
---
Instead of complaining non-stop, hating on the game and developers, he should grow up and understand what is and isn't acceptable in a business relationship.
---
He quit the game and is no longer supporting it via streams / exposure etc., this is perfectly normal.
---
It depends.  I usually havoc with a small group. Sometimes we are playing firemen, jumping maps every few minutes.  
---
Or if I play even more off hours, you can end just a handful against dozens, with numerous scouts/ guards on all easy objectives, and you are practically jumping maps not to play the one against the 20+ Zerg.
---
its noisy because he posted them on his main fucking channel...
---
Ive been wishing for more facial hair options for years :(
---
Guild and raid squads can be a bit less selfish and donate to those players. Like how in my world we give all the siege we get from reward tracks to our commanders.
---
He did share similar disappointments and criticisms, but he did so without being an ass about it and without trying to monetize his departure through click bait titled videos on YouTube (see top comment)
---
He has left the game. Makes sense he is no longer partnered if he has left the game and now making content for WoW.
---
In fact ANet should boot all partners no longer playing and invite new people that are still playing and commited.
---
I have nothing agaisnst the fcella. i follow him on twitter and watch some of his vids.
---
At least the story paths, yes.
---
I'm always saying those paths should have been made part of the story instead optional, since there's way too many people who arrive to Victory or Death and practically won't remember who Destiny's Edge are anymore since they haven't seen them since Setting the Stage.
---
Of course they're going to handle the partner that tells everyone the game sucks differently than the ones that just stop playing the game.
---
The only reason the partner program exist is to help ANet promote the game. 
---
if someone quits sliently it won't be noticed that quickly and won't have a negative effect, also maybe you'll come back when the next update hits.
---
Jawgeous is actively damaging GW2's publicity.
---
I agree with most of his opinions, but why the hell should ANet pay him for shittalking their game?
---
Same reason you'll never see a sports player talk badly about their sponsor.
---
Everyone has his reasons why he enjoys the game, and this is mine.
---
Anet: Hoooly shit! People are being sociable in our MMO! Shut it down!
---
spend the time you are not playing w2 now with a real job, earn some money, bey some gold, make exordium
---
I always do the Asura storyline as there is less ports between Divinity and Queensdale as there is in the human story. The Asura story all happens on one map and with the beetle it's fast to get to each next step.
---
Eh, both serve different purposes. Unsolicited *partially* constructive criticism is not a good foundation for a paid partnership though. Things would be different if they actually banned, copyright-claimed or otherwise deplatformed critics but to my knowledge even open violations such as Teapot's non-ToS-compliant addons have not been actioned (not saying they *should* but it would be a great excuse if they *wanted* to right?)
---
They exist but usually to sell or exchange items like gifts of exploration or other expensive stuff. I'm pretty sure nobody is stupid enough to give out loans because there's no way to guarantee you'll ever pay it anyway, unless you trade them something. Your best bet might just be to sell some map completes to a trading guild for gold.
---
I wasn’t really planning to invest 150€ into Guild Wars 2.
---
He's making content for WoW?
---
Guess that flirtation with FFXIV didn't last!
---
Guild wars 2 twitch viewership below 300 OMEGALUL imagine all the content around gw2 being based around a couple of hours of content every 3-6 months. No wonder you guys only upvote pictures people draw, it's the only content you guys can find.
---
Feather warband, they're known for their fleetness, their agility, and not holding their liquor well...
---
Gather ascended herbs -&gt; farm varietal seeds if needed -&gt; craft ascended herbs -&gt; plant ascended herbs
---
If gold &gt; 1000 -&gt; buy cheapest set of black lion skins
---
If enough of the static group -&gt; do fractals T4 + cms + recs
---
If raid planned -&gt; raid
---
I want to get back into keyfarm but... I'm just too lazy. :(
---
For how much are map completes traded in average?
---
Then just don’t do them daily... raids for most of the week are dead on eu, if they would be daily i wouldn’t have to wait 1,5h for group...
---
Jawgeous has a cannibalistic attitude trying to put PvP Vs Art like seen in his reaction of the cosplays. As a PvPer myself that is not acceptable, that behaviour has to go away. Just like Teapot bashing on the casuals and so on.
---
The game is a whole not one single minded community that eats the other.
---
Like 90% of anet's partners
---
Thats what I have seen him stream im sure of it?
---
If he'd posted a video titled "Things I wish GW2 would change" or similar, and then proceeded to have nearly exactly the same discussion except without repeatedly saying he was quitting the game, then you would be justified in saying Anet was wrong to kick him from the partnership.
---
Did he do that, though?  No, not in the least.  Instead, he made two videos centered around him quitting the game.  It doesn't matter whether or not any of his suggestions were good - the context he provided them in was "why I have already left you", and so Anet simply responded with "ok, bye".
---
&gt; I suddenly fell
---
glide you pleb
---
Well, pretty much all I do is do my dailies.
---
1. Enter sPVP, play 1-2 matches for dailies.
---
2. Enter WvW, play for how much time I have available / until I get most/all of the daily chests
---
3. Swap to my Engy who is camped in Rata for easy home instance farming.
---
Auric Basin and Pinata metas whenever I can make them.
---
T4 Fractals when I'm in the mood
---
15 min Key farm 1 per week
---
That's pretty much all I do in game anymore, and it's been decreasing gradually for a few months.  Don't even care about finishing Diamond Chest each week in WvW.  Started sPvP 3 weeks ago to try something new, but don't enjoy it enough to want to play more than a couple of matches per day.
---
Log in to play WvW with guilds a few days a week. If there's enemies then I get to play. If it's dead then we play ESO or WoW or minecraft or whatever else.
---
Back when dungeons had no cap and you could just speed run cof all day was amazing. Daily / weekly capping has always taken away some enjoyment. Anet's policy to actively prevent grindable content is baffling to me.
---
I understand achis and such being time gated for obvious reasons. But let me farm my gold whenever I want
---
Pretty certain that a partner that repeatedly makes videos about why their quitting might come across as a toxic association for the company offering that partnership.
---
doing it right now https://imgur.com/j1GUCqL
---
I farm Dragonfall until I get bored and then do daily fractals if I haven't already, then that's about it. Sometimes I'll go revisit HoT or PoF maps for fun but rn I'm working towards the legendary Bolt so it's mostly just farming gold in Dragonfall before it gets nerfed.
---
Judging by classes that I have the most trouble playing against, Spellbreaker and Engineer (holo or scrapper) are pretty strong right now. I think the value here is not necessarily winning 1v1s or 1v2s, but being able to stall long enough for a team rotation.
---
It's definitely both. It wasn't JUST the videos. It was the combination of Jaw being a complete dickbag for months on end (including this very tweet), and monetizing leaving the game in tandem with pushing another game to his fans. 
---
At that point what are they going to do? Keep him on board? Even partners who quit a long time ago are still partnered (afaik) because they're not being douches about it. It's not like anet keeps partners on a tight leash but they sure as hell are going to start getting messages from people who are like "why is this dude who's endlessly negative a partner?"
---
Anet is certainly unsupportive of constructive but negative criticism, anybody who says otherwise has never dealt with their forum moderators.  But this wasn't such a case by any stretch of the imagination; he's childishly dumping on a completely unrelated portion of the game because he's not getting what he wants elsewhere, he's ranting and throwing a temper tantrum, attacking everything that comes to mind instead of the actual source of his grievances.
---
Not everyone plays games for loot. Some people, wait for it, play to have fun. Maybe you should give it a try for a change!
---
yes, i understood that. you are planning that someone else invest those 150 bucks for you.
---
Which currencies specifically? The only mining nodes really worth openly farming are the Brandstone Meteors.
---
https://www.dropbox.com/s/4y5270wpxs6jgtk/gw008.jpg?dl=0 Featuring her beloved pet Fitz, who's getting bored of taking selfies on top of Hero's Canton
---
I did next to nothing on LW S4 maps prior to the Skyscale, and while I had some currency in storage from farming a guild mates home instance, I needed on average 100-150 of each currency.  I was able to earn that in about 5 days IIRC.
---
* Farm the nodes
---
* Try to get the map specific daily quests done
---
* Participate in the metas
---
Prior to this I had never done the Specimen Chamber meta before - didn't even KNOW about it, and I did that meta about 8 times over the course of those 5 days.  Sadly I have no reason to return to that map, but I picked up many achievements etc.
---
So don't restrict yourself to just buying the currency. There is fun to be had that can get you additional currency per day.  It won't all be soul sucking grind, I promise.
---
He's been doing that for quite some time in his stream though
---
No one needs to put real money in. You give 2500 Gold, you get back e.g 2800 Gold. That easy.
---
You know that they could have incorporated the camera hack to their tool stack by having the dev sign exclusivity for it, an NDA regarding the actual program, and regulating it's use to big events, right? It's not like there's no precedent for a company taking an "indie" tool and incorporating it, or even hiring the developer. Riot did that with Boompje's Mac OSX client, and that had even more potential for abuse since the guy could have perfectly straight up intercepted usernames and passwords with it (and didn't). Riot hired Boompje and didn't even take down the indie client up until a short while before they released the official OSX client.
---
500g per gift of mastery
---
ok?
---
I think they really just have to sit down and pick a method of delivery to actually 100% double down on. Obviously, if they truly want to go with living world then the episodes need to be bigger in terms of features and QOL, including a couple elite specs per release, making sure that everyone is covered per release cycle even if they don't give a fuck about the main story. 
---
Until then, things will remain chaotic.
---
GW2 definitely has enough players, that u can behave like this. GW2 is uninstalled now.
---
He's been frequently monetising negative dispositions and attitudes towards the game - not showing an interest in continuing and being a partner. Many of his recent videos have just been about his desire to quit and why the game sucks.
---
His explanation is pretty poor if he feels the need to ego stroke that he was the reason people play PvP (he isn't, funnily enough).
---
You can express anger, concern and disappointment about the direction of the game without being totally negative and repeatedly making "I quit and the game sucks" videos. That this is considered "tame" suggests more about PvP players than anything else sadly.
---
I had very similarly worded messages a few days ago, also flaming my colors and my title.
---
I'm not looking at it from a perspective of easy or hard.  I'm not a programmer, nor am I a programmer who works on GW2.  Many changes I see as being easy turn out to be hard or impossible, or just not in keeping with ANET's vision of how their game should run.
---
I'm just highlighting that while you are correct in identifying a slight disparity in performance because of the different game styles of WvW and PvE, that the sigils themselves also have disparate mechanics to compensate, and that different game modes require different stats/sigils, so isn't unreasonable to conclude that what a small scale / roamer equips shouldn't necessarily be the same what is used by a zerg player, or a PvE player.
---
Gw2 never was a lot higher. People play it instead. It's about 5 times smaller than wow and they just started classic few days ago.
---
I said any of that where? Exactly, nowhere. Besides Peachy, I don't even know the other two.
---
 that's what you get for loving a game and actually caring for it. 
---
Being outspoken is one thing, hating on the game and the developers is another.
---
&gt; cuz I can’t get Exordium
---
you can get exordium, you just dont want it hard enough
---
**Can we just have** ~~steady income of~~ **Elite Specs** ~~instead of them all being in one expansion~~**?**
---
U r Right i guess. Not hard enough to play a game I don’t enjoy (without Exordium) for 130 days
---
Of course not
---
Well you could queue *while* you are doing pve.
---
Also, are you on NA by any chance ? In EU I always need to wait 2 minutes tops to get into a pvp game.
---
Search dx12 in this subreddit.
---
Mordy's minions *overall* seem more sentient/self-aware than the other dragons'.  Mind also relates to the "[hive mind](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordremoth#cite_note-24)" qualities of the dream, and how his mind was transferable to his minions if he was killed.
---
Before he absorbed Zhaitan's ability to corrupt dead things, maybe his preferred method of corruption/control involved more extensive use of living subjects in blighting pods.  Zojja's mind seems to have been deeply affected by her time in one.
---
It's close enough that I wouldn't throw the whole theory out.
---
I just remember the other night, I saw a few buy orders for Cut of Quality Meat for 11 copper. I was thinking at the time I could vendor it and get at least a silver.
---
Maybe he wanted the gems to buy gemstore skins that he so criticized lol /s , it makes no sense why he is crying so much after what he did.
---
Because Anet offered no other way to actually make their game enjoyable to watch outside of a CAMERA hack to show what's going on better and wanted the event to be shown in the bad limitation their game has for spectating.
---
When you just say hack it sounds way worse, you trying something mate? :)
---
If I want to move the installation folder to somewhere else like a different drive without breaking anything. Do I only need to move the files and edit the shortcut on the desktop or are there other things like registry or whatever that I have to take care of?
---
I admire how much of an input he did for the PvP scene, but being a lil bitch for the last few months really made me think of him as an immature brat :) 
---
Sorry if you see this Jaw ^^
---
just reinstall to join
---
He made other people post those videos then he actively joined discussions. Jaw is the biggewt example of attention whoring or all gw2 partners.
---
No he's not, I assumed it was some ANet employee/contractor type that was responsible for WvW and PvP. I was wrong there, apparently he's just some streamer that didn't affect anything, bitched, moaned and quit GW. Now he's crying on Twitter about it. Really, it just looks like a typical case of attention neediness. Made videos about quitting GW, and now acts like a surprised pikachu for getting kicked out to get attention. Sad individual, that is all this is.
---
Some were dumb af “the fanart posts get more upvotes than my threads/videos” as a “core reason” for quitting
---
I mean, the game's *engine* is that old.
---
Already available. Very viking hair style, actually a recurrent hair style in the Vikings tv show
---
His physical corruption his plant based, yes; but it has been shown that he's able to create minions out of non-sylvari humanoids by use of mordrem pods. This seems to have a mental effect on whoever is placed in the pod, as Zojja has been stated to be in a scrambled state and drooling, implying that her time in the pod had negatively impacted her mental state; whether that's due to Mordremoth's mental aptitude isn't stated, but I don't think that it disproves the theory in any way. It's also reasonable to assume that the non-sylvari PC could be affected in a similar fashion if captured and placed inside a mordrem pod for an extended time.
---
I'll give you that mind doesn't necessarily need to denote strategic smarts. However, I'd argue that some of the forts are more important than you're letting on. Two of the forts were on the boundry between the Maguuma jungle and the rest of Tyria, so I wouldn't say that they had no strategic value in a fight, especially for an invading force that's looking for a foothold. You could argue that the fort in Kessex and the fort in Timberlane weren't as important, but getting an opportunity to ambush a complacent enemy stronghold and tear it apart isn't inconsequential.
---
My weekly routine: open game, log out.
---
I didnt mean new as in **New players**, I meant **new partners** to be added to keep it fresh as a lot rarely play.
---
Internet Connection is to slow To have the game reinstalled until this evening. I suck st costume brawl anyway
---
how do you know that you enjoy it with exordium if you never had it?
---
I would say sand swept or istan...since the metas have a lot of mobs to kill
---
This just reminds me of the surprised pikachu meme
---
And blatantly unkind things like https://twitter.com/Jaw_geous/status/1169554323350708225
---
Wiki is community-edited so that means very little
---
well its weekly so you can join next week
---
Because I saw it InGame and in video showcases, I play a lot of PVP as Warrior and Reaper, and I could totally use it and love it. I do know for sure that I don’t have any fun in playing without it :) I had a lot of fun, when I got hands on sunrise long ago, just having that skin gave me so much motivation and fun to play.
---
the game mode he was "building" has been dead for ages and i don't even recognize his name lol. bye.
---
couldn't care less tbh...
---
Sure. Keep lying to yourself
---
That was the first run that route. Before I tried to get up the HotW ship and northeast of the jp.
---
u r not serious that u give 2500 gold to a winner of a Costume brawl each week. It’s very rude to trick me like that
---
Even for the permanent merchant license they could make it an account unlock that changes the TP panel behavior to show the version that allows taking items that we get when talking to a merchant.
---
Oh my bad, let me throw all my gold at you because you keep bugging everyone about your fucking greatsword. You don't want to farm and you are in a farming guild - asking for tips and guides daily, repeating the same question 20 times a day and being annoyed when we don't respond with the same shit AGAIN, and then dismissing all of the shit we told you because it requires e f f o r t. Nobody will fucking sponsor you a legendary just because you pretend you need it so much that you can't live without it. You need a reality check buddy.
---
It’s a collection that unlocks at Cooking 425, and it’s relatively cheap for players who already have Cooking 400 to get that collection unlocked. Going for Cooking 500 is purely optional - the ability to harvest the new rare meat and rare seed are permanent boons that require relatively little investment for anyone already at Cooking 400.

Maybe just stop being a little bitch

My main point wasn't about no longer being able to share it. My main point is that you can get more of those timegated mats by buying something from the gemstore. Literally resulting in more of those being on the TP pushing down the price which seems to be your main concern. Obviously not as much as multifarming without having to re-plant, but still
---
&gt; ... replanting that shit daily which is more than annoying.
---
I find it more annoying that I have to wait until the end of the day to harvest my own garden. If I harvest before my guildies get to it? They get nothing.
---
Oh yeah, then I have to go replant...
---
Anet has no respect for players time.
---
Lw5 is official anet statement and they said nothing about new raids.
---
What does that even mean, yes he does. Did you even watch any of his prior videos, or one of his streams. You're just making an assumption because you wanna justify and feel comfortable about where the game is headed.
---
you call me out on my shit so youre being toxic 😡
---
They could make it an effect that lasts the same time. While you have the TP effect, the TP panel would allow you to take items without taking to a TP NPC.
---
While you have the bank effect, the inventory would get a new button you can click to open the bank. 
---
For those who have permanent versions, the effects would be permanent and would no longer appear in the effect monitor. The TP would always allow taking items without having to talk to a TP NPC, and the inventory would always have the bank button without having to carry around the contract.
---
Is there another reason to get partnered other than money/gems?
---
&gt;And you said that when you mentioned you want a business relationship between the aNET and the creator, basically hyping up anything they do without a single bit of criticism.
---
I never said any of that.  
---
&gt;Instead of complaining non-stop, hating on the game and developers, he should grow up and understand what is and isn't acceptable in a business relationship.
---
Is what I said regarding the matter.
---
If you could actually compile a sound argument instead of relying on lies to get your point across, maybe I'd be willing to listen. Until then, enjoy my last reply to you.
---
The last MMO I played was World of Warcraft, and that was almost 8 years ago. I remember movement was fluid and easy. Was trying Guild War 2 yesterday, and I find the controls "strange". When I used A,D to turn around - it felt kinda strange. When I tried to set A + D to strafe right/left and avoid turning - it was ever weirder and hard to control. So I'm not sure which Key binding I used in WoW because it was ages ago. I think the default? anyone remember what the default were?
---
But maybe years of strafing with A/D just changed how my brain is wired. On the surface - training myself to strafe with A/D sounds better, because it means more real estate on the keyboard, but because I'm going to re-learn to work with either Turn/Strafe - is there any benefit to get used to one over the other game-pay/dodge wise later on? one that has better controls when you need to move/dodge alot?
---
ok, i will give you the required gold, once you farmed all account bound mats and requirements to craft exordium
---
If I, as a business, had to choose between pissing off a vast majority of the playerbase (aka my customers) vs making everyone wait while providing other content, to pleasantly surprise and please them all, creating a huge hype and pleasant noise, the logical business decision would be the latter.
---
When you're going to come try have a discussion, try checking your opinion and personal preference at the door before coming in.
---
My personal opinion on the matter is elite specs at any time...even if it's 1 per year...because you see, I play EVERYTHING (probably at a higher level than you). The difference between you and I, is that I'm more logical and empathic towards other's situation and position when it comes to decision making - I, unlike you, do not prioritize my own selfish needs and wants, and instead look at things more objectively at a larger scale.
---
Do NOT feel bad though, because people like you, who are selfish and highly biased towards their own wants...are the majority.
---
You've experienced more toxic players on a map with ~100 players who can't get kicked than you have in an instance with 10 players who can? That's a real shocker.
---
What? I soloed him with viper reaper second day after Lake doric was released. What was so hard about him?
---
Alright then if you gonna accuse of lying and deny stuff you're saying, no point in continuing.
---
Lol half of the end game is playing dress up Ken/Barbie (and furry but we try not to talk about that) for most people.
---
This gives me a lot of motivation to play. I start the download now.
---
I do the quickest dailies possible and then I go achievement hunting.   The kind of achievements that tend to get you exploring and show you things you didn't know existed in the game. I don't care about the points as much as the adventure.
---
I see a lot of people's routines revolving around farming. That sounds like work.  Sounds pretty miserable if you ask me. But to each their own.
---
RemindMe! 1 Year
---
I bought two Storage Expanders yesterday and will buy 5 shared slots when they come to sale, so I stayed with my original plan.
---
Thanks for all the helpful comments :)
---
nothing really changed in my run
---
human noble rev, beetle to each waypoint i need for missions and then level scroll to 10, choose minister wi's party.  done fairly quickly.
---
Sooo beautiful
---
keep me updated on your progress
---
That is the whole concept of these sigils. You get permament damage bonus like sigil of force or stackable, more powerful bonus like bloodlust sigil, with the risk of losing the stacks when you die or change instances
---
I forgot, which stage of grief and loss is bargaining again? Elite specs are not comming.
---
It's unfortunate but I'm glad they spent the time on the map metas that still see more play than PoF
---
Multiboxing and huge guilds were most likely the biggest problem with this implemtation. My garden has 12 spots and I have never harvested them once since the upgrade of cooking. It wasn't worth it. Pulled my whole guild (roughyl 25 members) through my instance once per day and asked for a minor cut of the herbs. It circumvented the whole first part of the process. And was utterly broken moneywise. Especially during the first couple days and even until yesterday it was roughly 4g per account per day. That is more than the rest of the home will net you per day.
---
How does it taste, his dick?
---
There are also mordrem commanders standing in auric basin with a whole lot of missing backstory.
---
Tbh im kinda impressed he lasted that long, gw2 pvp have been in a downhill spiral since HoT came out and the whole shitshow the Pro league / World championship was. At some point dealing with anets balance just sucks all joy out of you, and all you are left with is frustration
---
[some of us do play it alrdy](https://gyazo.com/04a189bcb8e703d1442d4ddb1f273874)
---
Now I wish I'd held on to the herbs instead of selling them :P
---
Just euro logic
---
This is so thin skinned. People pointing out how he already publicly quit GW2 and that complaining he isn’t partnered anymore is a silly reaction isn’t “toxic”.
---
I mean, it's still fire. Like, call him the Dragon of Fire and Brimestone or Fire and Magma... magma is hot and burns, sure, but it isn't fire.
---
More Elites = More Skills = harder to balance.
---
Plus, more often than not newer elites tend to overshadow their predecessors..
---
Wanted to purchase this to try out the game. Reside in NA and make an account and sign in and site tries to pull a switcheroo and charge me $29.99 for it. Now its unavailable...
---
Who is gonna cast the mAT now (if it ever returns)?
---
This desire to let the "best" get in the way of the "better" really need to be fought.
---
We've been waiting 24 months at this point. Getting new ways to play eventually beats getting them never.
---
 Of course it's preferable to get them sooner. I would have preferred to have all Gen2 legendaries be available when I paid for them, which is when I bought Heart of Thorns in 2015. But if they *never* released them, that would have been worse than the alternative we got. (Which if you ask me should still have been an utter embarrassment even for a AA game studio like ArenaNet. Four years to deliver sold product is pretty pathetic no matter how you slice it, although not delivering at all would have probably constituted fraud.)
---
So yes, I'll take elite specs at *any* rate over zero specs altogether. At least if that's the only way ArenaNet would ever deliver additional skills for me to put on my skill bar.
---
What is your main? That spec will be delivered last.
---
Who said I never jerked it to underwear catalogues? ;) I think over the years my dad only ever had one or two playboy magazines. That I can remember finding at least.
---
I'm not sure why you're attacking me, but my comment was literally that I would be willing to let every other player have access to new specs early in exchange for me personally waiting.  I'm confused how that would be selfish?
---
There is nothing that stops from putting art into PvP and WvW? I don't get your point. 
---
When Anet replaced PvP or WvW for Art? 
---
They did for raids but not for art. 
---
Not to mention people who create these criticized art like the cosplayers and the drawings are not even from Anet so it doesn't even cost Dev time like the raids!
---
&gt; If I, as a business, had to choose between pissing off a vast majority of the playerbase (aka my customers)
---
Majority have all classes.
---
Those who play only one are the minority. It's VERY easy to get alts up in this game.
---
Its a bit faster now due to mounts.
---
Thanks
---
start with gift of the desert and gift of the rider, and level your legendary crafting mastery, if you havent done that yet.
---
So it's illegal to post non official sites on reddit now?
---
This is the wrong way to build a tier list. You need to take in consideration how they tier at each role.
---
This method will at best decide the best sidenoder.
---
I would be fine with that.  As long as the new specs aren't completely OP in WvW/PvP, it would help keep things fresh until mine came out.
---
Well yeah, I don't count using mesmer portals as "doing it again" really.
---
Having an alt is not the same as maining a class or primarily playing a couple
---
75 spectators? That'd be enough to place him as the 2nd most watched GW2 stream at the moment lmfao.
---
Ok, thanks. I will do that. I thank you a lot, already helping me to find a point where to start means a lot to me. I’ll respond back when I am done with that :)
---
Sure he can.
---
But don't say you're quitting the game and then put out videos advertising against playing the game and then complain on twitter when they stop paying you for being a partner. There's nothing shocking about what happened. I don't know why he's surprised.
---
I wish the warclaw didn't exist.
---
Art's actually been part of GW2's pedigree since its inception. You may not like it, but the art style and renowned concept art are a big part of the game's identity.
---
It's also a false choice to imply that it's *either* art or PvP/WvW/whatever else. The people doing and promoting art are not the same people implementing PvP features or balancing PvP classes.
---
Assuming you are not just trolling me, no it is not illegal.
---
But you are passing this off as official information when it is not. ANet has not said that no raids are happening again. They simply have not mentioned it. Raids being removed from this page is unofficial and does not mean anything.
---
Your posts and comments are trying to pass off something unofficial as official. Therefore it is misleading information and that is why the post was removed. 
---
If ANet releases a statement or a dev says no raids are coming, feel free to post it.
---
His response to people bringing that up seems like it can be summarized as "those were clickbait titles"
---
Who casts mATs?
---
&gt; outside of Raids, T4 Fractals, PvP, and WvW balance doesn't really matter. 
---
OK? They'd still need to balance the classes for these modes unless they closed them for good.
---
&gt; But, it might help retain players in other game modes. 
---
Such as? Balance is important in those other game modes like you said.
---
Or they should grow a backbone.
---
A lot of Warframe partners have been critical of Digital Extremes's laziness in recent years and they haven't been kicked out of the partner program. Hell, Rio made long videos criticizing them, criticizing Partners that are Partners in name-only and they didn't do jack.
---
Wouldn't more elite specs just add to the balancing nightmare we already have?
---
My comment isn't about a literal timeline, but how Elite Specs affect the game.  As long as the new Specs aren't completely OP in WvW/PvP I would be ok with other people having them first.
---
Other players change my experience of the game, and them having new tools would keep things fresh.
---
Who is that and why should I care?
---
Depends on races and things you chose when creating a character where the stories start to overlap. There's also little things like people not checking mail and advancing the story before starting an instance that can hang up groups.
---
Once you get past the racial stories that were selected as part of creating a new character you all can start getting credit for all members doing the story (assuming you all made the same selections). This typically starts once you pick an order ( Whispers/Vigil/Priory). The instance leader will be making the decisions and the other party members can "Accept" to continue their story once an instance is completed. If they decline, they will not get credit for completing that story step. If you all choose different orders though then your story won't overlap for 20-30 more levels (iirc).
---
It becomes a lot more streamlined once you get to LS2 and further. There are less branches. HoT has one near the start then joins up again soon after.
---
i dont know and dont particularly care about warframe drama, since i dont play the game. here, the dude announced that he was leaving the game, did it in an unprofessional fashion, and was afterwards unpartnered. why would he stay partnered? its not his critique, its the fact that hes not playing nor is he advertising the game anymore.
---
The only change I made is that now I bring Bloodbound weapons.
---
You can't put sigils in them, but they hit pretty hard at low levels and will level up with you. Better than using level 10 Fine weaponry, and you can bring them along if you decide to also farm the keys at level 40 and 60.
---
If you go for level 40 or 60, I recommend:
---
* Dead sister
---
 * Unlock monastery WP on your way. 
---
 * Go see Tervelan, unlock godlost WPs in your way.
---
* Orders:
---
 * Unlock Kessex haven waypoint in your way to talk with the orders.
---
 * Mortus Virge. You just walk to each kid and talk with them.
---
 * Triskel Bay. TP to Kessex Haven. Ignore all enemies and run straight to the last 2 groups fighting together with 2 abominations, kill those 2 groups and talk with the NPC. 
---
 * Speaker of the Dead. Just kill some Aatxes.
---
 * Pick Whispers
---
* Whispers
---
 * They went that away. After you knock down the enemies while invisible, you can basically just run to the end avoiding enemies and it's done. 
---
* Helping Hands : Hylek
---
 * Chosen of the Sun gets done pretty fast and all missions happen close to each other, and you already got the waypoints because you chose whispers.
---
Because people complained that Migraine is too hard, too buggy and not fun.
---
I have been a long-time sub of Jaw, like him and continue to occasionally watch his content, but still. It really is out of place to act surprised that Anet terminated the business relationship, given the kind of videos he produced towards the end. Being critical is one thing, basically advocating for abandoning a game is something different, when you're in a partnership with the developer.
---
Then again, who gives a flying goose. This game is sloping downhill fast, I at least I haven't engaged with it for a while now.
---
They did grow a backbone. He quit, they said "Alright, goodbye". It makes no sense to pay someone who has actively announced they won't be doing the job you were paying them for.
---
i would be so glad i i could use those perm contracts while moving...
---
I still grinded my karma for Aurora (which was 420k) in Dragonfall, but it was annoying to wait for metas to finish. The non-meta events spawn quite a lot of mobs though, and for that I would say the map is okay still.
---
For maximum karma in Dragonfall you need to be on the lookout for events and make sure you have a build that can quickly hit targets from afar.  Best events for karma are I would say the escorts which do not have stationary defense points, dolly escorts and crashed pilot ones.
---
No idea. I never got into GW1 enough to comment on this. The game wasn't for me. I did my time in co-op instance-based loot farming RPGs (where I couldn't jump) back in the early 00s.
---
Can't really comment on the different spectating systems and it isn't something I actively miss when I play but I don't see the harm in it being added either tbh.
---
We're long overdue a lot of things..
---
I think it's not that hard to understand when someone is being sarcastic or memes about something people label him with.
---
Look at reddit activity instead and you get my numbers. As I posted before it was 8.5k vs 1.75k and now it's somewhere between 10k vs 2k.
---
I certainly can't play anything besided semi afk opve train and watch a streamer. While in wow back in cata I could certainly do raids with a makro and watch tv on the side.
---
I would be interested in joining one. I've been really like the economics aspect of the game lately, and as a CS student, I love to create code to see market tendencies and such (just getting started tho)
---
mate, its against their TOS. its anets game, they can put in the TOS what they want.
---
a hungry family is still not allowed to steal bread.
---
same character creations parameters (race, "racial traits" like who was your sister) do give you same personal story missions and those can be shared, as long as everyone accepts same choice when multiple are offered.
---
If any stuff would be diversified, the story culminates into same about lvl 40. 
---
Don't forget to play story dungeons in parallel (aka story dung lvl 30 when you do lvl 30 story)
---
Give me GW1 world, skill/builds, and aesthetic but with GW2 combat, mounts, and open world. I would even pay a sub a fee!
---
Are people still angry about that?
---
Yes, it's very condescending of me to point out opinions and personal preferences as opinions and personal preferences:
---
&gt; If I had to choose between:...
---
&gt; I would choose...
---
&gt; I would be willing...
---
&gt; I would have preferred...
---
&gt; I'll take...
---
&gt; I'd be still happy cause I have...
---
I don't know everything...but, I most certainly know more than the vast majority of people.
---
Hypes are only as good as the delivery on the hype; if you hype people up talking about especs and then don't deliver especs, that's a failure.
---
I never said anything about a long silence. Have you actually bothered reading my comments, or have you failed to comprehend what is written? I thought I was clear, but apparently not.
---
You mean like you, youre bitching around cause some dude got removed from a partner program. Oh yes how dare he post a video onto his youtube channel. Youre literally bitching about his bitching.  You seem to have a pretty mouth, how about you use it for something other than your constant wryyyyyyyys.
---
*" I love it, this is probably the best community I've ever seen "*
---
You surely avoided this sub at the time of the announcement, and several days after it. And I assume you never stayed in the Mists (PvP) for longer than just a peek.
---
I don't know. Referring to Anet as "SJW cucks" might suggest the problem isn't really with criticism of the game but rather how it's been delivered.
---
A lot of the community - here, on Twitter, on Tumblr - have felt for a while that the streaming side of the community has been overtly negative and have been attacking other members of the community and the devs. While actively reveling and celebrating the dismissal isn't the best way to handle things, I can see why people are happy with Anet taking action against repeated toxicity.
---
Note, this isn't a ban or anything. It's the removal of partnership status from someone that wasn't doing much good for the game or the community.
---
You can craft as many seed pouches as you want and it doesnt really matter where you are doing it.
---
The problem is that you have to plant the plants daily.
---
maybe because you have to start the instance all over again if you fail...
---
Looking at his replies the guy needs to seriously lighten up. He is literally calling people trash for saying "but didn't you make a video saying you are quitting the game?". I mean he had some very valid criticisms for the game and i would quit the game as well in his position but what do you expect if publicly declare you are quitting the game?
---
Also what he implies is ridiculous. WP, teapot and almost everyone had the same reaction to the announcement and did not hide it. They were not remove from the program.
---

---
I would settle for auto equip of next seed pouch and returning it to inventory after dropping. ie I have 20 identical seeds, i equip them, plant my garden in  one swift movement and am left with 8 pouches. The clicking the inventory part is irritating, i can live with daily replanting.
---
I think Strike missions should be for casuals and not for the hardcore player base!
---
The truth is i play Tier 1 Fractals with Newbies regualöry and there are so many of them, who are not able to dodge, who stand in red circles and they don't care because they don't know better. And you want Stirke Missions to be and same level as Tier 4? lol
---
And did those people post multiple videos about why they were quitting?
---
It might come as a shock, but people that are Anet partners don't always need to be doing things related to Guild Wars 2. This is normal and standard, from people partnered as streamers, artists and writers.
---
They're not. Ghost of Ruin here is being an idiot, thinks he's being witty and cool.
---
Jawgeous advantageous uncourageous hypogeous spongeous we call him.
---
I think the best reward for this kind of thing would be tokens usable in a vendor with decent stuff that isn't unique and stackable at the same time. So people do not have to feel pressured into spending their tokens to get killproof.
---
For example, the vendor could have some decent exotic and ascended gear choices to help them gear for higher end content like high tier fractals, raids and WvW.
---
I'm pretty sure you can all do the same faction story and beyond. That starts at Lv30 iirc.
---
Technically, you can do the racial stories together too. Like the one where you infiltrate the Nightmate Court? Your non-sylvari friends also get the racial disguise...
---
Ascended stuff can't be gathered by guildies anyways
---
That kind of posting has been actively harming the community as well. It scape goats people who like something (sharing their art, liking other people's art etc) as a problem. The presence of people liking something that harms no-one isn't a problem. So many people have been taking it further and blaming these people and their posts for their grievances with the game.
---
It's certainly possible, but elite specializations are one of the headlining features that make this game feel like it has an evolving future. They're undoubtedly a ton of work, but it's some of the most important work they do. I can't see them abandoning elite specs unless they either try to replace them with something that attempts to do the same things, or if the game is no longer receiving major updates at all.
---
Jaw has been really aggressive with his disdain for the game recently.
---
It's pretty obvious how the relationship works. You pay people to be partners in hopes that they provide press and content when you do stuff. You will keep people who don't primarily play GW2 anymore in hopes that they come back for future content. You don't keep someone who plasters their youtube with sensationalized videos about how they don't like GW2, because why would you pay money for negative publicity? You don't have to be a shill, just don't turn your entire persona into bashing on the game.
---
Love that advert for a Logan/Rytlock ship novel.
---
People would literally grow crazy on the hype if they knew that the next living world episode would come with one or two new specs. And then when the trailer dropped revealing what classes would get them, we would lose our shit.   
---
Repeat every three months
---
I watched a couple of his streams, he did more than quit. He was quite pessimistic about GW2 in a way that was discouraging new people from joining GW2.
---
Even just branding one as "GW2 Refugees" is terrible marketing for the game when people see it from a partnered streamer. It makes perfect sense to no longer have someone like that as a partner.
---
No, hair stylist contract is worthless and absolutely no one is willing to pay for hair change to match new armor.
---
I think some Wiki contributors are trying to depict a framework in which each dragon has its own **unique** area of super-influence, and I'm not real sure that framework exists so firmly in the lore.  I mean, do we really need a distinction between *Mind* and *Persuasion?*  Like flight, I feel like it'd be okay for more than one dragon to have the ability to influence thoughts, so it seems like we could roll those into one.  Perhaps we should wait until some story aspects develop further before we establish such rigid criteria.
---
I...*probably* do play at a higher level than you...I probably do. Why do you feel attacked to know someone is most probably better than you at the game? You have never encountered people better than you before? This should have zero impact on you; but, since you feel attacked by this...please feel free to pretend I didn't say it.
---
I *AM* more logical and empathic than you. Your responses are evident enough. This support the argument of why you (and some others here) and my statements on the matter vary vastly. You (and the others here), whether it be consciously or unconsciously (applies to most people) prioritize your wishes and wants. It takes a great deal of conscious effort to not do that. This is attacking your approach and supported by WHY you are approaching it as such. 
---
I *AM* less selfish than you. See above.
---
I *AM* more objective than you. See above.
---
I *AM* less biased than you. See above.
---
&gt; ...less basic than you...
---
Not the term I used, but I'll go with it.
---
There's nothing wrong or upsetting about being part of the majority. Why do you feel "attacked" by this?
---
My argument states that MAJORITY of the people will be upset...which is true...even assuming a normal distribution of the NINE classes in the game. It's basic statistics and human behaviour.
---
People would be happy with ANY kind of mention of espec, regardless of if they said they'd be coming now or in a year...because it gives a projection and glimpse at the future...instead of the silence that they got. That is a COMPLETELY different argument that the one here.
---
You're digressing.
---
🤠
---
The dragons ARE different from each other. Why would they all need to share powers, they are supposed to balance the magic of Tyria, they need to be different. 
---
The dragons acquiring the powers of deceased dragons is already more than enough repetition for the gw2 plot. You have a dragon of ice and another of fire and you want them to have the same abilities?
---
Don't get me start on "the power of friendship". SU is like MLP, but with lesbian behaving rocks, instead of crypto-lesbian ponies.
---
MLP releases a lot of pointless and stretching seasons episodes; those are not even fillers, they are sooo god damn pointless, and every major villian encountered was defeated with Magic of Frienship bullcrap.   
---
Plus, you can spot a filler episode, if anything that happened during that is not brought up ever again, which can be the entire season.
---
SU is no different in this case, except that there is a plotline in SU. Some sort, overshadowed by watermelon stevens, and journey of Stevonnie in "white patriarchic disgusting world". 
---
Both SU and MLP have one thing that brought them success and fandoms - customisation. Both societies, pony and gems, have some sort of "open interpretation world", meaning you can make your own character, according (or not) to the customs, put it there, write an edgy backstory, and as long it doesn't disturb the main events and characters, it can be considered canon, because "it could happen".
---
While I know many shows are open that way, SU and MLP also have very distinguishable characters, that express themselves with the looks alone; they don't even need to speak. It draws all sorts of people in there. I even was drawn in both SU and MLP myself, thinking what I would like as a pony/gem, untill I was repulsed by both respective fandoms, and shows writing. 
---
As for fandoms - I hate both of them. 
---
I was on MLP convention with a brony friend. Never f\*cking again. I felt disgusted. I've seen sh\*t that would turn 4chan's stomach on the other side, and I couldnt stand being at MLP meeting, where they were watching slideshows with ponies (that are supposed to be about 15 yo) making peace sign with their back legs.   
---
And, oh god, if you see one brony, you've seen them all.
---
SU fandom has this problem, that is mostly made of feminists and SJWs. You might heard of it - a girl was pushed to suicide attempt, just because she dared to draw Rose Quartz as a thin lady, opposed to "plus size" (or overweight, I would say) she originally was. They will also frown upon any mascuiline looking gem OC, and you won't get popular, if your gem can not be interpreted as a woman of colour in real life.
---
Interacting with them is pure cancer, mixed with cringe. On one side hand you have crypto pedophiles, on the other autistic femin\*zi. 
---
^(I know I'm generalizing things, but those things didn't come from nowhere.)
---
&gt;I've yet to meet a single person who doesn't have all classes.
---
You must not have met a lot of people then, especially newer ones. And then this is a first, hi, I don't have an engi. I've met so, so many who don't have all classes. Besides, having a class does not mean you like to play it or would be in any way excited for an elite spec for that class. I think you're severely overestimating how many people play more than one or a few professoins.
---
Disgusting and degenerate 
---
Imagine if Anet started glorifying piss fetishes or cock and ball torture
---
"I quit"
---
Ok then, we're cutting ties with you
---
"How dare you cut ties with me you stupid evil people"
---
Have you ever watched teapots streams lmao?
---
I took the argument as "Don't release new specs" vs. "Release new specs, but at the cost of balance".
---
Your other question was, essentially:  "Why should Anet spend resources to support non-open-world gamemodes and their players?"  Which is a different discussion.
---
My point was that new Specs are unlikely to have a negative impact open-world content, while *no* new Specs would definitely have a negative impact on non-open-world content.
---
In a decision grid it would be:
---
________________________ | ___ Open-World ___ | __ Non-Open-World __ | 
---
No New Elite Specs ________ | ___ Same(Fine) ___ | ___ Same(Stale) ____ | 
---
________________________ | ________________ | __________________ |
---
New, but unbalanced _______ | _ Same or Better __ | __ Better or Worse __ | 
---
________________________ | ________________ | __________________ | 
---
From what I can tell, new specs would be a safer bet than no new specs for keeping more modes and players active in the game.
---
Edit: Formatting.
---
They don't compete with each other - no-one working on WvW is spending their time at work making fanart. The community on the sub chooses what posts they like or don't like, there's no harm in people liking art.
---
Scapegoating parts of the community as the reasons other parts of the game or community are not what you want them to be is incredibly harmful.
---
My point, is the 2nd domain feels like an afterthought and the way it's packaged and presented to us is completely inorganic and makes these apocalyptic monsters feel more like trite pokemon, than interesting and compelling characters. Obviously the dragons should be varied and unique characters, but they shouldn't be restrained by these arbitrary boxes. It would be like a video game introducing a new villain, and right off the bat they say "this villain is rude, comical, and has telekenisis" Don't tell us, show us.
---
They should probably kick like 75% of the remaining partners, in that case
---
Are you in NA? I wanna join one of this trains one day.
---
Every streamer in that clip is being a class act. /s
---
my point is he wasn't effective and appears to have an ego. raids are dead too and teapot managed to create a massive community event that doubled as his sendoff.
---
jawgeous just looks like he's throwing a tantrum
---
quitting is ok but its never ever good to burn bridges.
---
Obviously they exist but I doubt they are the majority.
---
Even so, adding elite specs for classes people don't have might entice  them to make that class, thus selling character slots. 
---
&gt;Besides, having a class does not mean you like to play it or would be in any way excited for an elite spec for that class.
---
Well you wouldn't know until the elite spec was announced.
---
Not everyone is going to be interested in everything and that's going to happen regardless of the update.
---
&gt;I don't have an engi.
---
So assuming they released 2 an episode, You would still not be upset about being left out since there would always be something for you to try.
---
So in that regard, it wouldn't matter to you.
---
They should make Seimur a regular vendor, though.
---
Haha, I don't mind this as much as I did the fUn LeGgInGs from the 30th announcement. But it's too soon, i'm still healing from that and getting Eiffel towered by Arenanet this way ain't fun.
---
using google is hard
---
*WHAAAAA!  u steal my goku blue!!1*
---
All points of argument lost due to 11-year old child grammar.  People need to type like an adult if they want to be taken seriously.
---
Also, WTB *extrasensorical* something-something.
---
Wowie! Nice art! I would love to draw my character too but don't really know where to start or what to use in order to draw it..
---
but which roles?
---
Take healer as example: if you queue as a healer...do you need to provide might?
---
If you queue as a boon-support...do you give ala/quic and might or just one of them?
---
How would you define the roles?
---
Awesome, thank you for doing this I'm sure some of my guildies will find it useful.
---
I was running it essentially as stated above. For open world, and beginner PVP it what stellar
---
Teapot doesn't bash on casuals, he made jokes but did a hell of a hot to help and carry casuals very stream for years.
---
To this day baffled that people give a shit about streamers.
---
Log-in, Fractal CM's/T4, Log-out.
---
Takes an hour, decent gold, fun/challenging.
---
Because quite simply it is a political statement. The "non binary" indentity was invented as a way for people without without any intresting personality traits to find a way to stand out, and adopted by social media and companies as a way signal how virtuous they are by "accepting" it.
---
It has no definition, nor any actually binding characteristics. It is completely vapid and can be adopted and dismissed in an instant, which makes it meaningless. Being gay has a meaning, man who likes men, being a lesian has a meaning, woman who likes women, ect.  What does it mean to be "non binary"? Absolutely nothing.
---
Essentially, it is a way for privileged attention seeking narcissists looking for an edgy label to makes them seem oppressed now that being gay is hip and cool, but without any of the drawbacks, risks or pitfalls of being actually being gay.
---
It is contemporary, it is politicized, and that makes it contemporary politics. As I've said in another comment:
---
&gt;They have have faced no oppresion or discrimination, historical or otherwise, never had to fight for any rights or privileges and they don't even have an actual binding definition. Its a vapid label that means nothing and is only useful for straight teenage larpers.
---
&gt;How many "non binary people" do you think were at stonewall? How many non binary have ever faced any ammount of lgbt related discimination? How many "non binary people" have gotten thrown of roofs or beheaded in the middle east?
---
It is not a coincidence that "non binary" people are only popping up in privilidged first world middle class conditions.
---
&gt; privilidged
---
Check your privilege.

googled portal/mounts and hidden garden to see if it could in fact be skipped by mounts, or if a mesmer can portal to finish it as i need to do it and i can't do that level of jumping puzzles.. I can just about do morgan's spiral first bit but second one i can't manage.. the dredgehaunt cliff one is maybe the hardest one i have done and i had to for the vista which annoyed me
---
Most of their "partners" don't make any content for gw2 anymore. And most people bashing the game right now do it out of love for it, albeit there's a few who aren't even constructive about it. No one wants to see it do this badly. It just is.
---
Daily achievments (2 pve, 1 wvw), guild hall, home instance, converters, jp chest in crystal oasis, log out :D
---
Get over it already. Tired of these posts.
---
Most on their partner list dont stream the game atm much less create a shred of content. But most just log in like 2hours every 4 months to shill the game like Peachy or Bogotter and encourage viewers to buy through their link to take a small cut of the money. Anet doesnt actually care about those people as they never made any critism except fluff stuff. Being a partner and criticizing the game  and then officially quitting is a direct conflict of interest so being kicked from the program is kinda expected.
---
Are you on NA? Should be easy enough to drop some ports for you if so.

Draw me like one of your french cats ~

It's also very likely that that page is a bit out of date, unfortunately. Jawgeous is still listed on there, so who knows who else is out of the program but still listed.
---
The amount of cheese in Prophecies is legendary, still my favorite storyline
---
The five stages of Grief:
---
Denial

Anger

Bargaining

Depression &lt;-- Kinda permanently here. Not related to the game. :p

Acceptance

You don't even need a train.
---
The last time I made alts, I was able to boost with the tomes I had lying in my bank, then between the solo-able HPs in VB, AB, and the first three PoF maps, I was just about finished.
---
Getting bystanders to help out on a few of the tougher ones, and a few of the multi-person HoT ones, easily put me over.
---
None of the CMs gave rewards, so none were worth revisiting.
---
Yeah, conflagration hangs up a lot of people because it's a pretty cool way of saying "fire." The definitions I've found for conflagration boils down to: "a widespread disastrous fire," but interestingly has been used to describe a conflict between warring countries as well, which could lead to a kind of double meaning with Conflagration that hints at his possible motivation (engulfing the world in flames) or a war-like personality trait that we haven't personally seen manifested yet due to not having a direct dialogue from Primordus.
---
To your point about minions, it's been stated in the past that Primordus and its champions prefer to actually make minions out of lava and earth rather than corrupting living beings. The forms that the destroyers make is often influenced by creatures they encounter. However, living beings *can* be corrupted by encasing the creature in rock and liquifying it into lava, and then creating a formed minion from there (whether that's true corruption or not is up for debate). There's also a Destroyer Queen that lays eggs that hatch destroyers, but it's left ambiguous as to whether this was once an actual living creature or if it just happens to be a pure destroyer that can create other destroyers in a roundabout fashion.
---
If it is for Obsidian you could also do SW. They can drop from the Lost Bandit Chests.
---
Also it would be better to use Unbound Magic for that and use the Volatile for gold/t5/t6s.
---
Nah. You dont retain your score between two different tennis courts.
---
Except for the order the announcement in itself wasnt bad.   
---
There was a misunderstanding. An obvious one ANet shouldve seen coming, but still.
---
These announcements are actually what the community has asked for for a Long time, and are (were) likely here to stay for future content
---
&gt; The 30th announcement was a 45m live event ( it ended up being ~35m, with the last 10m of that dedicated to merch...)
---
A lot of people fixate on the theatre angle. Personally I couldn't care less if it was a theatre announcement, a blog post, or a reddit comment. I was waiting for an unlikely sign of Anet coming to their senses and moving away from the living story model. Instead, they chose to double down on it. I'm not mad, I'm just done.
---
I love the Rytlock cinematic, really hoping that they make the charr more bloodthirsty because as WP said, they have become way too pacified in GW2.
---
The new zones are also hype, looking forward to them.
---
But the setting alone isn't enough to keep me around. It's not a series, it's an MMO - story and scenery is secondary to gameplay. I need group content that has replayability with prestigeous rewards. That's just not gonna happen because it's Anet and they are special.
---
I'll play this game for 2 hours every 4 months, as the management intended.
---
From what I've read I'd say it's the other way around ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
To start it's probably important to point out, it was not a main point of communication - it was a tweet from a writer, it may not even come up in the game.
---
Elder Dragons were originally described as elemental forces of nature, it's strange that any of them were ever gendered.
---
The two races involved in S5, the charr and the norn, have racial antagonists that are specifically misogynist. The charr because ArenaNet needs to explain why their own staff never made a female charr in GW1, the norn faction that specifically follow Jormag but dislike women because the slayer of Jormag's first follower was a woman.
---
Personally I think the sexist Icebrood plot is bad world building. It makes no sense that the GW1 norn, who were egalitarian, would hate women because Jora is a woman and killed her brother. Norn respect strength, it's part of the appeal of Jormag - it offers strength. It's inconsistent with who the norn are to fixate on Jora's gender as a reason to exclude women from Jormag's followers.
---
You seem to have accepted your depression. Congratulations!
---
I heard he actually was planning to release short video once a month just to officially still meet the criteria so he would be able to cash out longer.
---
Like what? Strike missions?
---
Aww that's a shame :( I like your ink drawings, you must have a lot of patience to put that much detail into the fur!
---
 I'm not familiar with the Hrothgar, but they look similar to the Ronso from FFX. There's always been furry races in FF (especially IX) it's silly to hate on them
---
I'm glad you like it! Rangers forever \o/
---
Idk, Teapot does defend GW2 a fair amount as well. Like just on the recent Icebrood Saga reveal stream he was being very objective in talking about reasonable expectations on what players want the game to be versus what the devs want the game to be and the potential for Strike Missions to actually be a possibly fun hardmode content that ANet might be able to actually have more frequent and consistent releases for than they do with Raids. Plus Teapot still streams GW2. He might be playing other games too (like Classic WoW), but it's not like he's just stopped streaming GW2.
---
&gt; they scatter and get distrated with the pirates
---
Not a problem on a rev. :)
---
You can easily kill them before they even engage the pirates except the first group which will end up gathering on the beach anyway.
---
Are you NA or EU?
---
I was talking to you about this yesterday...if you're NA, we might be able to coordinate and I'll meet up with you and show you how to do it.
---
It's not hard, just tedious for relatively few jewels.
---
No, I like that more. 
---
"Who knew that being killed would be my one fatal weakness?!"
---
Certain playstyles and builds were disproportionately screwed over.
---
lol i try to watch guides on youtube for stuff while getting HoT mastery points and i watched his quitting video ONCE now it pops up as next in the auto queue every time like uhg
---
I usually use "Next Ally" to avoid troll.
---
Not making content is ok, people take breaks.
---
Actively saying that you quit, then bash the future of the game, then whine about them not partnering with you anymore isn't.
---
That's what I mean.
---
Thunderhead enemies from metas GIVE LOOT! Plenty of dust and vm, and ofc karmics. This is the best place to get it. There is a cap, however, but it's unlikely you will hit it unless you do vista farm at reset kill. You get 50-100 karmics per meta if you tag well (i use flamethrower engi).
---
Sandswept specimen is also a good farm.
---
And also the Shatterer in Jahai, all mobs that spawn there also give loot.
---
When we finally get Expac 3, focusing on Primordus and the Asura, it'll be revealed that Primordus is eating the eternal alchemy.
---
Eternium will be the expansion-wide currency &amp; crafting material.
---
That hairstyle would not look like that at all in-game. The amount of intricate and tiny details, mixed with guild wars 2 graphics and clipping epidemic. That's a not going to happen.
---
Cool hairstyle though, though a bit excessive for my taste.
---
Still , they are obviously doing this deal , and both sides can leave at any point.
---
Again this is a sad situation overall and I'm in no way stating I support the decision. Also horrid timing since most of the community isn't in great morale after the (, in my personal opinion, ) underwhelming Anet stream :/
---
Agree, im very worry if this SM is just for achievements and common rewards only.
---
Thanks alot!! :) Very informative!
---
Bigger question. What happens with their buy/sell orders? Do they just vanish from the TP?
---
Thank you for the tips and for doing this!
---
Like an annoucement of an annoucement in a few months :^ )
---
That's actually a brilliant idea
---
And once youre finished they stay in your inventory and can only be deleted by playing Logan's Typing Adventure and also some of the letters have accent marks.
---
I am pretty sure by your comment that you don't know what toxic mean.
---
There was no tech to skip the dialogue (a trade off to use the in-world scenes instead of the Personal Story style). Story instances are terrible targets for  replayable content because most of your time in them will be spent waiting for dialogue - no-one wants that in repeatable content.
---
Strikes are much better - remove the "story" and just focus on the fight.
---
all this hate on jaw but i think he is the only one that has a video up for new players that is informative to try out gw2. everyone else is just reaction or lore videos but nothing of importance to people who want to get into gw2
---
The privilege is real with this one
---
Teapot has clearly already been afforded a degree of special status by Anet too. Actively streaming and using third party memory modifying programs in breach of ToS would get most people banned but that hasn't happened, never mind a removal of partner status.
---
Whether or not that is a correct decision by Anet is a different discussion of course but there is no denying that allowances have been made.
---
So... change your build? Crazy I know!
---
Too much work? 
---
It isn't rebuilding a lot, it is simply dropping players into specific game modes after the intro mission and setting flags as to what files are to be downloaded :P 
---
I would love for them to fix things, but your suggestion of fixing wvw and adding gvg modes before a steam release is a bit counter to your initial statement :P
---
[Why am I kicked off?](https://en.meming.world/images/en/thumb/2/2c/Surprised_Pikachu_HD.jpg/300px-Surprised_Pikachu_HD.jpg)
---
Yeah that's where I really think he properly needs to take some time out for his mental health and wellbeing - which is the reason he gave for playing FFXIV.
---
Clearly that didn't help and he needs a much bigger break from the whole streaming thing before other companies realise he's going around making comments like "Anet are SJW cucks" and he becomes an even more toxic commodity.
---
From his Tweets, he clearly sees what he is doing as a revenue stream first and foremost but companies aren't goibg to be keen to promote your content if you are that volatile, easily perturbed and quick to turn to pseudo alt-right insults.
---
More communication! You shouldn't have done that communication! You don't promote the game! You promoted the game too much! You promoted the game wrong! You monetize loot boxes too much! You tried to make money off of merchandise! You're not communicating about the right thing! You communicated it too soon! You aren't updating us on the thing I want! You already told us about the thing I want!
---
It's an endless barrage of contrarian criticism.
---
No, indie studios have magic that lets them do weapon skins in a short period of time. 
---
Anet is a big developer and therefore cannot use that same magic unless "gemstore purchase" is added on top of the development cycle. 
---
I would assume the same is applied to hair 
---
(for people who are confused, I am not criticising that things are on the gemstore, I am mocking past mike o brian statements regarding how long it takes for certain things to be made)
---
This!
---
Would make a good base for a sylvari hairstyle.
---
&gt; Most of their "partners" don't make any content for gw2 anymore.
---
So I went through their partners and commented a bit. Took way too much time to proof you were right, but here we go. 
---
[As](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/ArenaNet_Partner_Program) of May 1st 2017, there are 91 ArenaNet Partners.
---
When reading this, keep in mind that it's really hard to quickly figure out how much someone streams based on twitch accounts and if so what they stream. I could be wrong with a lot of this.

Zeyne - french mmo variety, very very little about gw2 (1 year ago were some giveaways or something)
---
I still think the game has to bleed players because of how awful the core story experience is. 
---
I know extremely casual gamer friends I have tried to get into the game who were confused by the game just dumping them into the world and the 10 level gaps between story chunks. 
---
Such a mess.
---
I don't understand why it is horrid timing. Its removing a toxic element from a community that has felt downbeat. At the minimum, it let's you know that Anet at least still cares about the wider perception surrounding the game.
---
It's small, but it's something.
---
He wasn't calling people trash. The guy he called trash actually had the handle "trash can't". I agree with you but let's not make stuff up
---
The amount of shit they are getting for making an event that gets media coverage and big views on Twitch is astounding given the criticism for how poorly people think they promote the game (or Twitch).
---
People have big issues with gem store cosmetics or loot boxes and complain all the time about them, but when ArenaNet released alternative revenue streams like Funkopops, again people complain. No gambling, no rewards taken from the game, no developer time spent on them, they take advantage of a hype event to market them to ensure potential buyers see it and yet somehow it's still one of the worst things they've ever done.
---
I'll be your friend.
---
Enjoyable to watch doesn't necessarily mean spectating tool but okay.
---
I said "bad limitation their game has for spectating." aka viewers on a stream. Camera is just one of the offenders, the lack of information on screen is huge in GW2. You cannot really tell what's happening in GW2 a lot of the time from the normal camera of a person and the UI. 
---
Compare that to WoW recent Janna race, even when they didn't have anyone trying to adjust camera for viewer's pleasure, thanks to camera being zoomed out + addons showing info on screen + overall how the game is designed you can actually easily understand and enjoy.
---
In gw2 even with the hacked tool, it was sometimes hard to see what went wrong. Without, it is a big hassle to stream with good info on screen for viewers to enjoy - apart from mainly raiding people that is.
---
So yea, the hacked tool is the least they could allow for how badly optimized this game is for viewership apart from fluff stuff.
---
I did, and there are dissenting opinions. Stop being lazy and support your opinions if you are going to challenge mine. 
---
I responded to you with why I thought the way I did, don't be lazy now. Or shut up.
---
How is being yourself and wanting to have your gender identity acknowledged narcistic again? You already stated the same on another comment, which I replied to. I don’t see why you have such a big problem with someone simply wanting to be openly themselves. You try to strawman yourself some picture of non-binary people as the enemy, stealing the well-deserved resources of the queer community. This is simply a phantasm you created. Non-Binary people are not a trend. We were around throughout history and just managed to get a community up and going again. We are an oppressed minority, just like many other members of the ever-growing acronym. We suffer under the hetero- and cis-normative system the same way the other members of the queer community do. Why do you try to depict us as attention seeking edgenobels?
---
how are display names not unique? i have many characters based on dc heroes that i had to name with odd letters and umlauts, or was that a copyright thing?
---
I only play the revenant with its POf elite spec.
---
It has all I need.
---
My second recommendation would be guardian.
---
It was a joke, mate.
---
I bought mine with gold. Honestly I don't think it's about the amount of garden plots, if there were only 4, the prices would have been way higher now (if we desclude the sharing part). Sharing would probably still have brought the prices to very low threshold if we had only 4 to work with, enough for them to concern with over time. Except this time it had to be done alot sooner.
---
Thank you very much, wasn't able to find it with they keywords I used to search for it since my problem was more specific/different than that thread you pointed out, indeed the issue is referred to just inside the official forum one.  
---
Have a nice day \\ o /
---
1) Your gender identity is quite important. Just speak with some transgender people inside the gender binary if you won’t take my word for it. 
---
2) A gay person who never has sex with someone else is still gay. Being gay is not falsifiable. BTW: Are you ignoring bisexuals and asexuals? How would someone prove to be an ace in this case? Regardless: Just because you can’t falsify something, does not mean it is not true. Again: Speak to some other transfolk to realize how ignorant you just are. There is no reason for us to go through the trouble we do if it were not for the fact that we want to be ourselves openly. How is that different from the experience of a gay person? If you believe transgender people are better off, take a look at the murder rates.
---
["Anet are SJW cucks"](https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearTransparentClamBCWarrior) is legitimate criticism?
---
The bar for that seems to get lower and lower every day. And strangely, the people making these arguments about Anet "silencing criticism" always seem to forget that neither Mighty Teapot or Wooden Potatoes have been removed from the partnership program.
---
Which is also an important point. It is *only* removal from the partnership program. Anet aren't actively seeking the removal of his videos which is something [that developers that actually try to censor criticism do through abuse of DMCA](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-31-second-youtuber-complains-of-dmca-abuse-from-escape-from-tarkov-developer).
---
I realise that it is popular to hate on Anet at the moment and I'm definitely disappointed in the quality of the announcement too, but they aren't silencing legitimate criticism.
---
1.) Aha. So, you draw the line at "Everyone who doesn't suffer from a medical condition isn't non binary." 
---
Cool let's go with that. You are not intesex. I'm willing to bet more than 99% of non binary larpers are not intersex. 
---
Neverminding that, intrsex is not actually in the dead middle it very rarely if EVER is. People born with these conditions still have most features of one sex, they just have either a second set of vestigial genitals from the other one or vast hormone imbalances, both of which are usually fixed shortly after birth by a doctor and prescriptions.
---
You turning a serious medical condition into an identity (that most of the "non binaries" don't even suffer from) is incredibly insulting.
---
2.) If a gay man can't get hard by the sight of a vagina, is he a bigot?
---
3.) No, it doesn't actually tell me anything. What does "not aknowledged in laws" mean exactly? What right are you missing that everyone else has? 
---
"Fired for their gender", no gender discimination laws do exist. You can't be fired for being a man or a woman, and you haven't given any alternative for these two alternative so far.
---
&gt; Intersex people are also often mutilated at birth.
---
You don't actually consider doctors fixing birth defects as "mutilation" do you? That is insanely disturbing.
---
&gt;With all the hate and ignorance people will throw at you, like you prove with your posts.
---
Yeah, gays in saudi arabia get beaten senseless and thrown off rooptops, but someone on reddit criticized you, so you're basically the same.
---
He means your account name.
---
&gt;It can be.
---
Hi, this is what you said.  I'm telling you that this is never true, because causation does not equal correlation.
---
And I meant what I said about education.  You offended not only me but other autistics with your comment.  Think about that.
---
Can regular nodes still be shared?
---
I suggest you stop replying, thanks.
---
Elite specs are planned years in advance. If they didn't show them for an episode that will hit in 3 months, then they don't have them.
---
Nice to meet another one who thinks about trying to change the gameplay for a bigger challenge :)
---
I actually did play gw2  with various restrictions and interesting goals before, and i found that diving into lore and your character/race helps a lot.
---
The problem is trying to fit it in the story mode. 
---
Where in gw1 the story mode of your character is semi-fixed.
---
In gw1 youre a random guy, who groups up with other random henchmans, later on with mhenlo and gang, (and heroes later on), and goes trough a story as a adventurer.
---
In gw2 you are THE commander, trough and trough .
---
For example, i made a perma death blood legion charr, that i leveled only in ascalon zones.
---
I combined my charr storyline with exploring and doing ascalon meta events, AC dungeon, and before joining traherne to form the pact , my last order from the blood legion was to help out the high legions, with the help of the pact, in fireheart rise, to finish CoF.
---
In another challenge, i played a sylvari ranger (adventurer profession) as a member of the Tyrian explorer society (the guys that send you 100% map completion mails).
---
Before doing any story steps, my goal was to do 100% map completion AND all mini dungeons/ jumping puzzles...with 0 deaths.
---
But all these goals were placed before actually doing the first personal story..meaning after its done i just play trough 3 lw seasons and 2 expansions in a normal way.
---
Im trying to figure out how to have big goals trough all content.
---
Maybe just keep on the "treasure hunter" theme going on?
---
Most of us had shitty parents growing up that never understood us.
---
Grats on being the status quo.
---
Do you know an even worse idea?
---
Having no elite specs at all.
---
I apologize for hurting your feelings so much. I'll try to baby-fy my words for you in the future.
---
The day the announcement came out I argued with people in the discussion thread when they attacked it for communicating wrong. When I tried to ask how ANet should be communicating it just kept coming back to them not announcing elite specs or an xpac. It seems more like people were mad that they didn't hear what they wanted to hear rather than them communicating wrong.
---
metabattle lol
---
What the fuck is your problem.  I'm reporting your posts, ciao.
---
Yeah did not notice the name up top. Still he is being amazingly rude to people that are criticizing him.
---
just a quick note to add to your comment:
---
You cant have an account display name starting with a 0 after the dot and you also cant have the same number twice, so its not possible to get .1123 or .1122 or .1112 or even .1111. 
---
Therefore the "smallest" number can be .1023 and the higehst is .9876. If you have two accounts with the same number at the end in the creation window/website, the account that was created later, will have its number jump to the next higher one.
---
if both accounts for example are "Jadowdra.9875", the one who creates the account later will get Jadowdra.9876.
---
If both show Jadowdra.9876 in the creation window, the second one will get Jadowdra.1023 as his account name.
---
You can change the number behind the . by either changing letters in your display name or by changing your mail adress. If you use gmail, you can simply add a "+1" before the @. Then you can go higher "+2", "+3", etc. until you get your desired account display name number. All accounts will be managed in the same gmail account.
---
Source: I created several accounts with ".1234" at the end. =D
---
you are confusing reddit community with the game community :) Reddit is just a very toxic place.
---
Man they should do something about that. 
---
There's plenty of people and streamers that do way more than these people who obviously don't touch the game. Why not actually support people who actively support the game?
---
I did go through the thoughtprocess of people who "main" some class and I figured theyd just accept theirs possibly being last within a week or so.
---
Maybe?  PoF specs didn't take over the meta completely when they came out.
---
I'm sure anything they introduce would be strong, but based on their current design directions I don't think especially OP.
---
I'd rather suffer a few months of not having full access to the meta than let the end game scene languish in the meantime.
---
Its easier to balance 1 coming spec with existing specs than introducing 9 at the same time that are constantly changing. They took like an year to fix mirage, any new spec would be fixed within 2 balance patches (1 month)
---
I've done drops only runs on a couple of characters where you only use gear that you get from mission rewards or from general drops.  Event drops are fair game.  The rules also cover collection rewards and crafting if you want it to.  No mystic forge stat swapping.  
---
You can have it so your character picks crafting disciplines just to learn how to craft better equipment for themselves using materials they gain on their own (no access to mats other characters have gotten).
---
Someone on GuildGab likened in to how the extreme cold of the north and south and tall mountains can be "persuasive" in pulling you to sleep.
---
If you sleep though, you will most certainly lose everything. It suits Jormag well. 
---
Most of the icebrood seem mindless or feral, the ice having screwed their minds, but some Svanir in Bitterfrost explicitly demonstrated that a degree of willpower means you can retain sentience. Still follows Jormag, but I am EXCITED to meet more talkative icebrood like that!
---
Fire and Conflagration for Primordus? Who wrote this? That's 2 words for the same thing.
---
Wow, it's almost like reddit consists of many people with differing opinions. And for the record, you can definitely criticize one thing and applaud the other without being "contrarian" (seriously, what the fuck).
---
&gt; I never claimed that. Are you so desperate for a strawman right now?
---
So, can you decide what exactly is non binary already instead of jumping around it? I asked you once and you brought up intersex people, and now you're claiming that no, its not just intersex people. So who is it?
---
Can you give me a definition yes or not?
---
&gt; Not being non-binary does not make you a bigot. Hating on people trying to be themselves makes you one.
---
A gay person being himself means he has sex with other men.
---
A lesbian being herself means she has sex with other women.
---
What does "being yourself" mean for a non binary person?
---
&gt;You are still alive, aren’t you? Weird. How privileged you are.
---
Well yes, I never made any claims to oppression.
---
&gt; See what I did there? Being born in a country that does not kill you for being who you are does not mean you can’t be discriminated against. This is not a contest about who has it worse. Besides, you ignore the problem that there are non-binary people in this places. They just 1) Would have a harder time realizing it because the concept goes against their social norms and 2) would probably not tell anyone because they know what would happen. 
---
Ok, again, I'm gonna name a bunch of actual oppresion/discimination problems gay people have gone through:
---
&gt;Gay people have had sodomy criminalized, they have been repressed by police, were denied service practically everywhere before the riots, they have had suffered through noumerous epidemics chiefly the AIDS epidmic(some of which are still ongoing today like the syphillis epidemic) and in multiple countries around the world they are still hunted and beaten, killed, thrown from rooftops or beheaded, or in some of the most gruesome cases, forced into having sex change surgeries.
---
Can you tell me which of these are applicable to non binary people? If not, can you tell me what oppression/discrimination have they gone through?
---
&gt;How often do you think these people have problems talking about their sexual identity even if they need to because it is the reason they need asylum? Do you believe not being cisgender would be easier for them?
---
I've said it like 20 times so far that gay people get beheaded in saudi arabia.
---
Hell of a job you did there, sir, but how dare you say wooden Potatoes‘ videos are too long.
---
&gt;Except transgender people still identify as men or women.
---
I see where your problem stems from. Some transgender people identify as men or women. But what makes you transgender is having a gender identity different from the one people assumed you would have based on your sex. This of course includes non-binary gender identities. 
---
&gt;If someone has sex with men and women, they're bisexual. If a man has sex with men, they're gay. Pretty simple.
---
Not simple, simply false. Your sexual attraction makes you gay/bi/ace/etc. Not the sexual act itself. Besides, incels want to have sex. Asexuals are pretty much an anti-incel…
---
&gt;Which of these "troubles" have you gone or are currently going through?
---
I have lost more friends from my coming out as non-binary than I did when I came out as non-hetero. I got more ignorant people to deal with. More people trying to build strawmens. More people simply trying to deny my identity. I at least never had someone tell me that homosexuality does not exist in my face. I won’t talk about some assholes using physical violence because I don’t feel the need to list what exactly happened to me in my life because you need some reason to believe that non-binary people also get the short end of the stick.
---
This is gorgeous.   
---
 Your line work and color are both fantastic.
---
Also the way he responds to people on twitter might have something to do.
---
Reminds me of posters that claimed to have quit wow but still posting in mmochampion when I used to play that game.
---
Nah, Zhaitain's weakness is the same as those players who eat a Primed Light Beam: failure to dodge.
---
Had Zhaitan been 'gud', would have dodged that laser beam that sliced off its tail, swooped around and one-shot the airship.
---
But instead he didn't, and likely created an alt-account to complain on the forums, begging for nerfs to Pact Airships, which is probably why they got roflstomped by Mordremoth vinedrils at the end of S2.
---
Because people don't know at a glance that it is easy in game.
---
So having separate store pages on steam would go a looooooonnng way to immediately educating people who have no idea at a glance.
---
Rev is much more fun at level 80 when they have full access to skills.  Easily the worst class for leveling manually.
---
If you don't like the other suggestions, give Power Daredevil Thief a try.  Not top-meta for endgame at the moment, but always reliable DPS.  Easy rotations, and high sustain when you trait Invigorating Precision.  While leveling, you can tear through Personal Story missions with your high mobility.
---
Not a ton of synergy with Necro.  Although, if your SO runs a minionmancer build, you could also try a Condi Venom-share build. Definitely NOT meta, but would make her critters feel OP.
---
Toughness or vitality?
---
I'm playing a thief and *I know* standard build is full berserk. I was just wondering when aiming for a bit of survival what stat would be best. I guess I'm asking for thief but also just generally, when do you pick which?
---
Seeing long friends lists with people that haven't been on in years is a weird kind of pain.
---
hmm?
---
An Anet partner who made videos/streams only for money. He quit GW2, made videos about it to generate even more clicks and now he is bitching around because Anet revoked his partner status.
---
Never heared of him before though.
---
Sylvari and Asura have both received no new customization options for several years running.
---
I created my account after the announcement too because i was disappointed af at that time. Doesnt mean i'm not a real person
---
&gt; Snowcrows isn't the only way for builds/raids you know?
---
Yeah, I was just lazy and went for the widely known one. But even in a mixed dps mirror comp you are still most likely to have 3 dps players sharing the same food but only 2 supports (3pdps+3cdps+2heal+2boon). The higher you go in skill level or optimisation the more those supports will shift towards hybrids leaving fewer and fewer using support food.
---
&gt; The third one is new bufffood (cooking 450). ;)
---
But not ascended, not account bound and in no way worthy of being anything but another lvl400 recipe unlock in and of itself. Also awaiting a bugfix to prevent abuse on low-level characters if the wiki is accurate.
---
When I read the announcement I thought they'd lump those boring passives in with the primary stat and leave things like the day/night effects, endurance regen or might-on-dodge and add a few interesting new options like maybe movement speed or skill procs. And I was definitely hoping for a modular system where you loaded up a "tray" with several base dishes instead of having to go to the wiki so you don't grab the wrong secondary stat by accident...
---
I have to wonder did they look at that app in action and think well it didnt give anyone an unfair advantage therefore we'll let it go, we will never know the answer to that, but Anet must have agreed it behind the scenes else Anet would have just flat out told him this is a ToS violation and will result in a ban, alas it did not.....
---
Teapot has also openly stated on stream that when content comes out for the game, he will be back to play it, but as of right now he just has nothing to stream in game, i find it funny ppl get on this case for playing another game, when there are other so called "partners" who only stream GW2 when an update comes out, then they disappear for another 2 or 3 months.
---
You are in denial. Anet cant poop out elite specs like that. This announcement has been in store for over a year now, for over a year Anet knew we were going into Season 5 with no xpac. So, if in a year, they haven't began thinking about elite specs, we're still at the very least another year away before we get any. But even then, not announcing it pretty much confirms is not within the plans for this Saga.
---
So we might get elite specs, eventually, but within the next year, maybe 2.
---
I'm on stage 5. I've accepted it and I'm on the hunt for a new MMO/Game. Gonna check out the releases but thats about it.
---
I'd love tattoes for humans and more tattoe options for norn :)
---
Don't you like charr playing guitars ? /s
---
I'd also like textures for skin, as in old and wrinkly and body models that have more than 10% fat on them
---
Yeah! Go to the north side of the main building by a campfire and climb up the scaffolding. Woodenpotatos has a vid too
---
And i'd love myself some gemstore chest and leg pieces, not just gloves, helmets and boots
---
I have found [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/76624/black-lion-keys-and-transmutation-charges-temporary-removed-from-map-completion-rewards) from 4 months ago. I don't know if they put it back again or not.
---
Yes, Nuuvem is a pretty reputable site. I bought my alt acc with them a while ago in a sale, and never had any kind of problem with it.
---
Nah, Colin took the table with him when he left, it was part of his personal belongings.
---
TBH, as underhwelming as the announcement was if they would have done ONLY the magazine it would have been worse.
---
Wait I don't see myself on that list. Am I really that irrelevant :(
---
I would refer to this list for a more updated list of partners, I think anyways. https://welcome.guildwars2.com/en/partner-program
---
There so much i'd love to have for fashion wars, but outfits are whats hot, so... It is what it is
---
Eh. It's usually the same people. This sub isn't huge, you can easily count the people you always see posting, sans the occasional new guy experience post or question.
---
That’s a good point
---
I went by the wiki list, you aren't on it? List is from 2017. It's the newest one I could easily find.
---
I definitly missed some like Shayrianna, and some maybe aren't even partnered anymore. List is a mess, like I said.
---
You know, those kinds of comebacks died in the 90s, early 2000s.
---
Came back to GW2 yesterday.  Finished the first three collections.  Looked up the guide for the rest....over 5 or 6 days.  Logged out again.  Maybe another few months!
---
China only copy u, not vice-versa
---
I'd say, if they were remotely close to any plan of releasing new specs (as they did with notable yet missing features years ago), that would be the main thing on the event...Even a few concept art might do the job, but that was not the case.
---
An announce like elite specs would be a critical move at this point, however they said nothing, so I assume they are far from having any material on that area.
---
I'd also recommend guardian, it's great on every aspect of the game, versatile while simple, and can easily mitigate a lot of damage.
---
&gt; Whoever is in charge of that, if anyone really is
---
I think David Ortiz was on charge (the Spanish CM), and no one took over when he left.
---
In fact, he had multiple things going on, many as personal initiatives, and all of them died out the moment he left. No one even bothered trying to keep what he built alive.
---
Sad thing is, you can't play chronologically since living story season 1 was a open world thing that never returned. There is an npc in Lion's Arch that shows the cutscene about that period of time but you wont get the full experience. Meeting many important characters that became full time parts of the game, experiencing annoyance and drama about the main antagonist...
---
You poor bastards will never experience listening to "die die die. Die die die die die" in dredgehaunt cliffs or the panic and horror of failed twisted marionette world boss...
---
Ah, nostalgia...
---
&gt; I don't see any contradictions in the domain reveal so it's not really a retcon.
---
It's a retcon in the literal sense. It's a retroactive addition to the continuity of the lore (retcon = retroactive continuity).
---
Shadow was probably taken because it's the only thing that could really fit with Zhaitan at the time (post-killing Zhaitan) since they didn't design him with one beyond the three D's of necromancy: death, decay, and darkness.
---
But while we couldn't pinpoint any one thing and say "that's Shadow", we could at least see the arguments made in Zhaitan's magic for where Shadow lived - even if it was as minimal as the risen appearing in a puff of darkness being "Shadow"(stepping).
---
We can't really do that for Kralkatorrik's Fury.
---
&gt; Jormag's "persuasion" is kinda obvious and boring but at least it matches one of its (their?) observed themes.
---
It matches Jormag's behavior and actions, but that's not really a domain of magic.
---
Like I said, Fury, Persuasion, and Conflagration match the three Elder Dragons' behavior and actions, and that's all. Jormag's method of persuasion is ultimately little different from Mordremoth's - both use telepathy in order to coerce, persuade, and trick. The only difference is what they're using to do that persuasion. Jormag promises strength, power, and survival; Mordremoth gave promises of a purpose and home to sylvari, and sometimes even made his influence take the appearance of something else (e.g., for Caithe, it came in mimickry of a Wyld Hunt; for Scarlet and Occam it mimicked their own thoughts; for Canach it was a buzzing sensation, and for the Commander it was loud threats and demands).
---
Jormag's persuasion domain is basically a sub-domain of Mordremoth's Mind from what we've been shown. And it's more about Jormag's actions, rather than some magical domain that they oversee. It's just a very odd - and as you say, obvious and boring - choice to mark as a magical domain.
---
Glyph of Alchemy?
---
Maybe because fixated person died in spikes or was still midair xd nice tho
---
The magazine lists Fury, Persuasion, and Conflagration on the same scope as Shadow and Mind.
---
So while they do feel like they're just characteristics and not domains of magic, they're presented as the latter.
---
do you maybe have a [glyph of alchemy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Alchemy)?
---
It would convert plat to mithril if I am not mistaken...
---
Deadeye.
---
But, what I meant was they didn't kick out every other spec.  Thief/Daredevil, Dragonhunter, Warrior/Berserker, Chrono, Druid, Herald, and Scrapper are still Meta in those modes.
---
If they only released a normal promotional page instead of yet another  unreadable attempt at fancy art...
---
Then we're told they're running low on resources.
---
Yeah I actually didn't even know that wiki list existed tbh, I've always gone by the one I linked. All good though, if there are any washed up gw2 streamers who don't deserve partner its probably me :D
---
as last  150 pvp players gona tell you,PVP IS COMPLETLY FINE WITH BEST BALANCE EVER. only mesmer got master trait blocked for half year and AT doesnt work,still one game mode and another 2v2  map was added...
---
Does that count as a kill? Was the speedkill record broken? Is there a record anyway?
---
So many questions :|
---
I mean it immerses you in the world space more as you have to move through it and plan your journeys, not that waypoints are themselves aren't canon. They're a core plot point of the early Living World, so yeah. But my point is that not using them makes Tyria into a world again, instead of a series of waypoints and things that happen to be near them. 
---
If we're going for lore, it's never explained how you can waypoint *from* anywhere, to my knowledge, as it's explicit that they have to be placed on leylines but you can just teleport *from* anywhere, even when you're not near a leyline. Personally, I think that makes travel a bit too meaningless because it's so instant but I get it from a game design point of view. 
---
I actually like the WoW equivalent as it's slower and gives you a bit of a tour, which makes travel choices more meaningful because do you really want to watch yourself fly for a minute or should you do more local stuff? ESO has a free waypoint-to-waypoint system *and* a spendy instant-anywhere system. Different games, though, but I feel that GW2's system makes travel feel a bit meaningless at times. 
---
I suppose you could do a "you can only waypoint from a waypoint" rule, but the slow travel rule is more appropriate for a challenge run, in my opinion.
---
Bro I asked this back in 2012, they said no, people asked this many times in ama's they said they will not make this. I've deleted a dozen 80s over the last 7 years cuz i hate the race or looks i made on them, just make a new character and dont be lazy. Hell i even deleted my 1st character when the servers opened in 2012 after its 1st bday bcuz anet wont make a race change. Hell I'd be pissed if they do it now.
---
No joke, I'm subbed to two of them, and I've heard of a third. No clue who the rest of them are, nor have ever seen their content, or their content linked.
---
i wonder if her hair clips thru her body if shes in combat stance.
---
U gotta download wow classic 1st. Then you can uninstall safely.
---
Scourge, the literal Scourge of pvp. The most meta thing since it came out xd
---
Aaand that's why I would never touch the skyscale tools. Not even with a ten foot pole.
---
Oh I agree, if new elite specializations were coming during The Icebrood Saga, the livestream was the place to say it. So I assume they simply aren't a feature of Icebrood, but I see no reason to think elite specs have been discontinued evermore.
---
Great art, good job :D.
---
I agree. I think criticism and constructive negativity is absolutely fine.
---
That isn't what Jawgeous was doing though.
---
It would be nice. At least to sell the fertilizer/compost component or whatever it is.
---
That limits mechanics, because how can someone cc the mathias sacrifice, when there's only 1 person in the fight~
---
Not sure if there is any difference these days TBH.  I grew up in a very liberal community, and had a friend move to Portland, and man, after a few years living there, they were no longer the same person I knew, and didn't even seem to live in, what I like to call, reality.
---
Some people don't want to give money to the radical left. I am one of them, that's why I uninstalled Guild Wars 2 today.
---
&gt; it doesn't need to suggest that all characteristics listed are domains of magic
---
The whole "domains" thing have been nothing but "domains of magic" though, so it does suggest - whether it needs to or not - that the listed domains are domains of magic.
---
&gt; Magister Ela Makkay: Each dragon has two spheres of influence. For Mordremoth, that's mind and plants. Zhaitan ruled shadow and death.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Arcana
---
&gt; Taimi: And we know that each dragon has a "domain" when it comes to their magic; Zhaitan's was death, obviously.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi's_Game
---
Though it's curious the new statements by Taimi are "embodiments" and not "spheres of influence" or "domains of magic"
---
&gt; The first Elder Dragon defeated by the Pact, Zhaitan embodied all things shadow and death.
---
&gt; Second Elder Dragon slain by the Pact. Embodied "plant and mind"
---
&gt; Primordus embodies fire and conflagration.
---
But then we have the OOC article "Bound by Blood" where Kralk's Fury and, Jormag's Persuasion, and Aurene's Light comes from, quote:
---
&gt; Zhaitan, Elder Dragon of Death and Shadow [...] Mordremoth, Elder Dragon of Plant and Mind [...] Kralkatorrik (also known as the Elder Dragon of Crystal and Fury) [...] Jormag, Elder Dragon of Ice and Persuasion [...] Aurene could absorb his magic and take his place in the pantheon as the Elder Dragon of Light.

---
Which doesn't give them labels other than titles of what they were Elder Dragons "of" in the same light as the gods' titles and domains.
---
One curious thing is that Aurene only seems to hold one domain then. But then again, she's the "Prismatic Elder Dragon" and magic is constantly compared to Light, so her domain is practically "the domain of all domains" if we look at it in the retconning-to-needing-many-ED way.
---
Can you send me your gold before? :3
---
&gt; How is talk/discussions(/whatever) about gender and sexual identity a political topic?! Is this something I'm too European to understand?
---
The issue isn't that there is talk/discussion about it, but that to one side of the argument, there is no talk/discussion, and anyone who doesn't believe in their viewpoint completely is immediately labled an -ist, -phobe, or their favorite go-to, a card carrying member of a certain political party that sat in government in Germany from the late 30's to mid 40's.
---
EDIT: one has only to look at the downvoting going on to see what I mean.  A portion of the people nowadays are convinced they are right, and anyone who disagrees with them isn't just wrong, but evil.  Ironically/tragically, some of the foulest people recorded in our history books (including the leader of the above mentioned German political party) thought the exact same way.
---
You know thinking about it I realize why this strikes such a bad note with so many people. Firstly, it's an elder dragon, not a person and so gender identity seems so out of place for a force of nature. Gender as in sex roles and sex stereotypes is something that comes from a very human/mortal way of thinking. It's human culture and something that most people expect something as large and powerful as an elder dragon wouldn't pay any mind to. After all, if you're above fearing death wouldn't you also be above caring about things like gender presentation? Secondly it appears so far that this isn't being done because it contributes to the story in any meaningful way but is giving the impression that the purpose is to 'score woke points' as people have said. At this point you're no longer telling a story but instead just waving around the right flags and using the right buzzwords to make yourself seem like a good person. Androgynous dragons are fine. They should have all been androgynous to begin with and stayed that way but to talk about what gender the dragon identifies as comes across to me like pointless tokenism.
---
I'll just leave this here https://youtu.be/zdZbi-UAQEM?t=21
---
(also: can I have your stuff?)
---
Why not before, when they had other LGBTQ characters and stories?
---
Quite a reply to an old topic...
---
Dragon champions take many forms, not just draconian ones. For Zhaitan, there were the Mouths and Eyes of Zhaitan, and several dozen other humanoid champions. See this list for all confirmed dragon champions: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon\_champion#Zhaitan\_.28Risen.29](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_champion#Zhaitan_.28Risen.29)
---
The Giganticus Lupicus in Arah explorable is definitely a dragon champion. And as it stands, it's the only dragon champion to predate Zhaitan's awakening in  1219 AE, having been corrupted by Zhaitan during the last dragonrise. This puts it on par to Drakkar, Great Destroyer, and Glint in terms of age. Whether it shared the same role of "herald" or not is unclear, unlikely to ever be delved into, and overall rather likely.
---
&gt; Who? Legitimate question; who's annoyed by this? It hurts no one, and changes nothing. Albeit (in my opinion) unnecessary for ANet to gender the dragons, but still who cares as long as they make it a good story.
---
There was *one* case where it kinda mattered: Glint, and they got it right. Both egg-laying and asexual reproduction usually fall to genetic females. 
---
Giving Mordremoth a deep, commanding voice (which tends to be associated with masculinity in humans) also was very fitting for the mind control theme.
---
Political discussion about gender identity **is** a big topic in some parts of the U.S. but honestly non-political reference/usage of the subject itself *shouldn't* be. If anything giving *all* the EDs some kind of non-binary gender identity would make them feel more alien which they *should*, but that can be misunderstood as portraying RL non-binary people as eldritch monsters (because CoD creates school shooters and anime causes you to touch little girls, you know)
---
They already said they uninstalled.  What you should be asking for is his login information so you can then send their stuff to you.
---
Stupid question, but people still play Guild Wars 1? I played the shit out of it with some friends back in the day, but I just assumed it faded into obscurity and shut down as GW2 gained popularity and got more content. Are they still updating GW1 at all, or is it just in maintenance mode?
---
I think the deal just ended for everyone for whatever reason.  You just happened to be really unfortunate with the timing.
---
Imagine carrying about what gender a fantasy dragon has. Oof
---
It's not up to date. MMOinks, for example, left the partner program about six months ago.
---
We just really don't have a current list of Anet partners.
---
Please explain.
---
Let's be honest with ourselves, we all know what Anet is doing here and it's not for the purposes of "good storytelling". It's more ham-fisted shoving of their beliefs into a game wherever they can even if it has no place at all like in this case. Elder Dragons are above such human notions, they are things more than actual creatures with gender or whatever else.
---
It's something they decided during season 2, some dialogue in the Priory's inner chambers, someone talking about an ancient book that talked about all the Elder Dragons, if I recall correctly. But, can't say I agree with the decision. The "two domains" thing only works with some of the dragons.
---
Prismatic.
---
Maybe it was a coordinated strategic campaign to do it this way. I think it’s absolutely brilliant!
---
&gt; Toughness is also used in aggro priority for lots of enemies, so by becoming tougher you're making yourself more of a target.
---
Right, no toughness then :p
---
sadly not, am on EU but i really appreciate the offer, very kind of you :)
---
I really don't care what gender the dragon is.
---
If actually find it kind of strange them having genders at all, since they do not have junk and they do not seem to reproduce sexually. Glint laid eggs, but where's the father? That was clearly parthenogenesis. 
---
They are just dragons. We kill them, we replace them, and have parties in between. 
---
Anything else is looking too much into it.
---
Let's see how they actually handle it. The dragons, Elder or not, still maintain some aspects of biological life and sexual reproduction actually is quite prevalent IRL and nigh omnipresent in complex life forms.
---
In this particular case though, and this idea started *waaaaay* back, I genuinely hope Jormag is female or at least decidedly anti-"alpha male" in some other way. Purely for the irony regarding the Sons of Svanir having few defining characteristics outside of being stereotypical misogynist brutes.
---
I guess they prematurely pulled the deal because it had 8 days left on it.
---
they said 2 years ago that they are working on the WvW update and its coming in the next months, only to say that they are working on it and its coming in the next months, on one of the biggest announcements besides HoT and PoF, with 30-40k viewers .... you know .... you can only fool people for so long until even the last yay sayer is not believing you anymore and quitting the game
---
10 out of 10 would super buy style kits if they added new options.
---
Is this magazine format a new thing?  Haven't played long enough to know.
---
If it is new, then I do agree with the OP.  Players wouldn't have been overhyped unnecessarily, and might even have reacted positively to ANET taking a new approach to marketing the game.
---
Players were bound to be disappointed no matter what, but I think the overhyped countdown, rented theatre, etc, just set up so many players for a higher letdown.
---
I'll withhold judgement until the Saga plays out. We'll see if and how it comes up in the game.
---
The denial thing is a joke don't take it seriously :).
---
I don't rule them out 100% for ever, I rule them out 100% for the next year, 2020, and maybe even 2021. That's it basically.
---
Same reason to not through scrap metal into your composter - it attracts skritt.
---
idk but i dont think its normal to promote streamers as partners who didn't play their game for 5 years already, but if you think its standard fine for you
---
gachiBASS Clap
---
&gt; Secondly it appears so far that this isn't being done because it contributes to the story in any meaningful way but is giving the impression that the purpose is to 'score woke points' as people have said.
---
It's world building. Those notes were written by Taimi, and that's something Taimi would be interested in because it's an Elder Dragon, so she wants to know *everything*. Jormag is also the dragon of persuasion, and it could help to express herself or himself depending on who their target is at the time.
---
I found it funny man.
---
Thank you and /u/Gulbasaur for such amazing answers. I really apprciate you taking the time to help me out.
---
If I am starting a new character should I unlock the Tyria mastery system before I start the new character so that the new character can help progress with that? (I havent been able to check out the wiki as its blocked from my work).
---
Oh, that's fine I think that person is misunderstanding me. I was suggesting the site to experiment with some different builds for new classes not to actually be meta.
---
yeah that magazine with 50 % filled with mediocre merchandise?
---
oh nvm the announcement stream had 30 % ads aswell
---
I wasn't into this but now I am. Thanks for explaining it. I'm always low on gold so this could possibly help in the future to be a stable income for me
---
Yeah I absolutely agree
---
These are my thoughts, exactly.
---
The content looks like it's there. It looks like it's going to be amazing. There's clearly enough of it for screenshots and some video content, and it's being released in less than two weeks, so there \*\*has\*\* to be enough to do some kind of video showing it off. The number one thing I saw after the event was "that's it?" because we just didn't get to see anything new. They told us we'd get "expansion worthy" features, but they didn't show us any of them, or anything really to get excited about. This e-zine was more exciting than the presentation, and that baffles me, it really does.
---
&gt; Gladomer - actively streams pvp / wvw as far as I can tell
---
The only GW2 streamer that I stomach watching for more than 15 minutes.
---
The thing is, there shouldn't even be a discussion. How does it affect me if someone identifies as x? Right, not at all.
---
&gt;...encroaching linguistic authoritarianism...
---
I wonder how many fits this guy threw in grade school trying to learn grammatical style.
---
"You know who else docked people's grades for putting prepositions at the end of sentences?  *Hitler.*  Checkmate, liberals."
---
Playing casually since day 1 too, I have nothing legendary.
---
&gt; Glint laid eggs, but where's the father? That was clearly parthenogenesis. 
---
You mean like looking too much into that to come up with that THEORY? You assume they have no junk but there is no proof of that either.
---
You're kinda contradicting yourself here with the whole complaint.
---
In every communication about the event it was clearly stated numerous times that this is about living world...so this was already done!
---
Go back and look at the announcement for the event and every post about it. You as well as the few others who keep harping on this chose to not see this and hype expectation way beyond what Anet was trying to do.
---
I will say this everywhere I can. Anet did an amazing job with everything around icebrood. Expectations were set and exceeded for me and the majority of the community. I finally have friends and family jumping in game that have never played before. 
---
I’m super excited and can’t wait to play the first episode!
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aid\_Worker\_Sya](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aid_Worker_Sya)
---
So lemme guess. You agree with the article then.
---
It seems to me like average people don't know what world building is.
---
That was probably one of the fastest Godwin's Laws I have ever seen.
---
Why aren't there any notes on whether Aurene prefers head scratches or belly rubs? Come on Taimi, focus on the truly important questions first!
---
It's easier the second time around.
---
I would say it's private
---
Oh, well i tested them on my skyscale hatchling tools, but i got different results depending on the glyphs i used. Also underwater still gave 4 while land was down to 3
---
No worries man I found it funny. And your list showed me some active people I didn't know, so that's awesome.
---
Plus should add that Peachy  streams GW2 every tuesday with her Peachy parties.   With NA and EU alternating weeks.
---
I still haven't even crafted a legendary I want to but I just get bored of the idea. I have bought Juggernaut though.  Honestly was kinda disappointed the metal effect is annoying to have on your skin at all times and the steps are are very small.
---
ight imma head out
---
Lol. Thanks Gorrik.
---
Sshhhh! 🤫
---
oh, i did not know. thanks for the interesting insight!
---
I was going to say, peachy does stream GW2 quite a bit still. Though her output has basically become "Peachy talks about kingdom hearts while doing random things in gw2"
---
I can confirm it did work for my friend, so yeah. may depend on the person you come in contact with, and it was at least 5 years ago, so things may have changed.
---
I don't care about controversy, for me it can even ba a magical space unicorn as long as story and gameplay is good. Just make it well.
---
Sparking of streamers, why is gw2 so poor when it comes to streaming. "thanks" to my current job I have a lot of free time at and for the first time  I'm discovering twitch. Every day I check for gw2 and the most viewed streamer has like 80 people watching. I don't expect massive numbers on mmorpgs, since they are not as fun to watch as other games (tho wow classic is making retarded numebers) but holy crap that's low
---
I think after every one I have crafted I get disappointed with it eventually. Except the Binding of Ipos, that has been my favorite so far.
---
Aren't dragons just kinda big reptiles? This might blow some narrow-minded minds: https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27814-zoologger-the-lizard-that-changes-its-sex-to-suit-the-weather/
---
*Especially* since I don't think they could get away with showing a giant dragon donger in 12/13+ rated game XD
---
Plus parthenogenesis doesn't really work all too well in complex lifeforms, not that it would matter to our three confirmed generations of dragons.
---
Reptiles often have internal genitalia, but Kralkatorrik also had Glint. Glint was not created like the Wrathbringer. She's his daughter. Where's the Mother?
---
I looked through the wiki archives for up to a few years back and couldn't find any documentation on it, not even in the wiki notes sections of the patches. You'll just have to take my word that it was an intentional change and not a bug.
---
Only because you get 2 gifts of exploration per map completion.
---
(part 2)
---
*Roy - thanks for letting me know my list was broken. You stream, Mr Washed Up? Yeah you do.*
---
*RyuTheRed - Doesn't really play gw2 but other stuff.*
---
*Samajestay - Sam... still plays? He still plays. Huh. Didn't know.*
---
~~RPG Shack - twitch deleted, youtube last video 1 year ago about MountGate~~
---
&gt; Hey, RPGShack here. Now RPG_Al3x. I took a break and left the partner program about 6 months ago, and I gave up YT for streaming as it was easier for me to fit life around.. Slowly coming back in.
---
In this thread. Talk about active. :)
---
 Sanctuary of Wolves - One deleted twitch channel like so many, nothing else &lt;-- actually still on new list
---
~~Seth Hendrix - one youtube channel with no content~~
---
*Shayrianna - plays!*
---
*Slaydra - plays, but other stuff! No gw2!*
---
 ~~shadiz_live - he ain't live. plays wow.~~
---
*Spelette - playing WoW as I write this, last gw2 content 9 days ago. Did not answer, maybe does only speak french or paid no attention*
---
Edit: He answered, still plays. Maybe next week or so.
---
~~Sindrenerr - F, twitch deleted~~ (not up to date with him, what happened?)
---
 ~~Sywo San - Last gw2 content 1 year ago, videos on other games~~
---
*The Cryophoenix - ERP elitist raider, streams occasionally*
---
~~Tellawe - 123 followers, last clip from 2 years ago. not sure if active.~~
---
*TiffyMissWiffy - I can only see GTA here*
---
Edit: She is active on youtube, but I didn't find a youtube link on anets list. Maybe I am stupid, maybe they are. From this thread:
---
&gt; Wait. Haha I still do some GW2 content I did all the Skyscale content but took a bit of a break between seasons (but still somewhat was posting on YT).
---
Let me just say real quick how much I love people coming out of the woodwork and commenting. I *will* update.
---
*Tigerpfoetchen - Stream title: "Anet Partner." Well then... 10 days aago last stream.*
---
*Tramadex - PvP, active*
---
*Valkyria - is on a study break but didn't play gw2 before that either, only other games*
---
~~Welc - last content with PoF release~~
---
Wilson Storm - I could be wrong, but his last gw2 vid on twitch is from 6 months ago.
---
Wooden Potatoes - makes way too long videos on way too many things way too often. Maybe saps energy from the rest?
---
~~Wubdor - 147 follower on twitch, cant say anything. sorry. ~~
---
*YayItsKate - Streams, 7 days ago was last. What do you think about the recent development?*
---
---------------------
---
Summary: ~~Anet could throw out 80 of those 93 and we wouldn't even know they existed. I think for most it was just a thing to grab free gems.~~ In my not so humble opinion anet should also boot everyone who produces content every 3-6 months for a quick cash grab, and by content I mean 10% terrible game play and 90% standing around and showing their humongous tits off. But I'm also a misogynistic elitist fuck, so anet probably thinks differently about this matter. I don't reaaally mind and it's not a hill I'm gonna die on.
---
Long story short: The partner program is a total failure and an uncurated, uncultivated mess. Whoever is in charge of that, if anyone really is, is probably living in constant fear their lack of work is discovered and they are thrown out. At least they are in good company with most of those partners with their work ethic.
---
Edit: I still stand by that, even if the picture looks different after the updates. Have a hard time calling it something else if the info isn't correct and doesn't link to the right ressources. Also still some questionable people on it.
---
_________________
---
**UPDATE**
---
I added the people who joined the program in the last 2 years. The picture is a bit different now, and so is my conclusion. There are *a lot* of content creators who only create content every major release, and those who occasionally stream or are generally unheard and unseen by the broader community. I'd still say "quick cashgrab and benefits" for most of them, if they get anything out of being partnered. Some just fly under the radar and you never hear of them.
---
Some are straight up dead, but not as much as if you only take the outdated list, obviously. Looks like anet did indeed remove partners, but they did not remove as many as they needed for me to call this list "good" or "curated" or "well maintained".
---
In short: We have not enough partners who create quality and quantity content, and too many who are way too invisible.
---
It's straight up bizarre.
---
thanks Tekkit 
---
also if you want to reach from 400&gt;440 cooking very fast and cheap you can craft 40 to 50 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cup\_of\_Light-Roasted\_Coffee](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cup_of_Light-Roasted_Coffee) the recipe is sold in POF maps or choose from crystal desert reward track , after that enjoy getting the levels from collection , also grab guild-hall crafting buff from tavern vendor
---
Still reminding myself that Jormag is considered a male in multiple instances in-game, yet an actual GW2 writer decided to ignore that and say he's non-binary.
---
I'll edit that man. Please no hard feelings, it's a lot of people. :D
---
Obvious shill (paid or not)
---
90% of the posts on reddit are complains &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; OP: THIS COMMUNITY IS GREAT.
---
Even if OP is legit, community doesn't mean shit when the game-play is poor. Unless you're a casual I guess?
---
(protip: Casuals dont buy as many gems (no whales)
---
Jormag was presented with male pronouns and no one cared.
---
Till now when ANet says "fuck that" and decides to make him specifically non-binary.
---
Because GW2 just doesn't have interesting streamers, and the viewing experience is poor to say that least. Game streaming is like, 70% personality and 30% actual game and GW2 fails on both parts.
---
That's really the gist of it.
---
Thanks! I was too lazy to do all this work for a PSA.
---
Now, thanks to this, ascended food crafting will be much cheaper. Much appreciated!
---
&gt;Firstly, it's an elder dragon, not a person
---
The writer himself said they were writing the Dragons as "people", so expect this to happen a lot more.
---
&gt; He is the only dragon to have possessed an interest for magical artifacts and items
---
Not really true. In Season 2, Mordremoth goes after multiple Priory caravans housing magical artifacts (Concordia and Iron Marches) as well as waypoints and krait obelisk shards (Fort Salma), and in Honor of the Waves the icebrood are hunting down magical artifacts the kodan have. in GW1, the destroyers also tracked down and assaulted a magical shrine to Raven and Primordus assaulted six asuran cities akin to Rata Sum, each would have been highly magical by themselves.
---
Kralkatorrik's the only one not shown to hunt down sources of magic. But at the same time, once we got to him, magical sources went to *him* instead and then he just went to chow down on the Mists.
---
Zhaitan's Shadow domain has been established since Season 2, and while vague, it does fit. Though it's a retroactive addition that blends too much into the same themes of death and decay they always had for him.
---
Nope, its worse in game believe it or not
---
I still like your memes, Kev &lt;3
---
How is it strong? Function gyro is ruined. Doesn't do enough damage to make barrier as in the previous rework description. Doesn't hold a point as well as a bunker guardian can. Works well in WvW I here, but in PvP, no one plays one.
---
That sounds like tons of fun if I would be lucky enough to get in. Commanders running HoT trains always fascinate me. Like how do they know the map so well while I get lost every 5 steps? XD
---
They recently updated a few minor things such as increased the bank slots.(defaults), and gave us the option to further increase our inventory bag slots.
---
A few graphical updates
---
I think the last content update was on its 10th anniversary, a chain quest which from which you can get "decade" weapons, or tokens to exchange for balthazar weapons.
---
Actual story and gameplay content wasnt added since guild wars beyond.
---
Theres still quite a lot of people playing it.
---
Almost all play on amer district 1.
---
Pre searing is still has its community, kamadan is still the most populated place to hang out and trade.
---
During festivals major cities get multiple districts, like, 7+ at least.
---
There are old veterans, actual newbies, and returning players who show up, play a bit and leave from time to time.
---
The community are usually driven by weekly events and moved by daily zaishen quests
---
&lt;3
---
Happy to hear that, dude. Your type of content just isn't for me, because contrary to how this list looks I don't have much time. But I'm happy it exists, and I hope the comment points that out.
---
Our guild meets 5 times a week in the gh before starting missions, WvW, etc. It's all about the actual organization of the guilds, not the guild hall.
---
Hehe, I think I've actually used that one myself:-)
---
Hey I made the list :)
---
Wait. Haha I still do some GW2 content I did all the Skyscale content but took a bit of a break between seasons (but still somewhat was posting on YT).
---
Edit: as requested YouTube: www.youtube.com/TiffyMissWiffy
---
Both accounts could get banned.
---
Reading this fucking article.
---
 Ergo vis-a-vis, Concordantly.
---
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPFNIXgF32Q
---
Surely you have enough mats to make one
---
Thank you! The answer to this problem is always "WHO GIVES A FUCK?"
---
I usually zoom in closer, behind my character, with the camera moves on the side.
---
So its like, one of those 3rd person shooters i guess
---
Don't you also get the home instance garden from the silvari line?  Even ignoring the ascended seeds, having four nodes of nearly whatever you want could be nice, as would eventually being able to grow your own dyes.
---
Well, there is still magic in the game. Easy to transport your genes into other forms.
---
The only way my friends could gift them was to just give money via paypal...
---
I don't recall ever arguing against that, so what's your point?
---
Sounds like youre only playing pvp and not the rest of the game lol. Find a guild/group of people to enjoy and play the game with. Its insanely boring playing solo
---
Ah, that kinda sucks.
---
Arguing that someone's identity is a political topic, rather than just a mundane one, is a political argument. "I am normal, but you need to justify your existence".
---
Well, you looked at it from human-asura-charr point of view, not from dragon point of view :)
---
Anet doesn't really create content so they can't expect partners to do something
---
Thank you!. Will join you guys for the 10:30 PST tomorrow.
---
Who he?
---
I may have messed that up, I may need to take the blame for that, I can’t recall 🙃
---
Or chaotic enough to mutate those genes significantly between generations, maintaining diversity/survivability without requiring genes from other dragons.
---
Is like some procedural generation possibly with random,and unknown boss encounters. Instand repeatability as long as rewards are good and,worth the time and effort
---
That the game isn't innately poor to watch.
---
The best use for that seems to be on a sickle to get the herb seeds.
---
It's a meme but he does mean it
---
Arguing that someone's identity is an astophysical topic, rather than just a mundane one, is an astrophysical arugment.
---
Sounds a bit depressing. :/ 
---
This might be my last kick at the can if that's the direction the writing is going. Game play has been a bit boring for me too and I've mostly just stayed for my friends. Sad it's come to that as I've been here since pre-launch. Oh well.
---
The belief that discussion of gender or sexual identity is some kind of statement, rather than just discussion about a fundamental aspect of a character, is a political view.
---
i have a friend who bought HOT extension, but we both don't what to do and we're getting bored.   
---
Sad story
---
Why would anyone be scared of Irony?
---
That would be awesome but I can't hold on to hope.
---
Even worse, being threatened by an autistic biologist getting distracted by it. It's like two levels of pathetic.
---
Again, I never said that. I said the viewing experience is poor which does not mean it can't be fixed. So again, what's your point?
---
No. I'm saying that we don't know where Glint come from.
---
For all we know Kralkatorrik could have cut off a bit of himself and that could have turned into Glaust, like some gods in human myths on Earth.
---
Well, Zhaitan was mostly a collection of reptiles, but they were all dead. Mordremoth was made of plants, which, I suppose, can be male, female, or neither. 
---
Kralkatorrik was literally made out of lightning and rock.
---
eaSyRoca - Didn't even make the list FeelsBadMan...
---
I wouldn't say that tbh. It took me 2 hours to go through that list and check, and I'm surprised anet doesn't do that and finds out what I did. Updating would be in their best interest, too.
---
But bonus points for taking part of the blame. I think it's a shame creators are so invisible on this sub.
---
You can also search this Sub Reddit for WoW vs GW2 comparisons. There was a ton of WoW refugee traffic here when BFA was bombing hard. :)
---
When or if you get in-game don't be scared of asking questions and looking for Guilds. And GW2 Wiki is fantastic for searching for anything about the game!
---
Have fun. :)
---
They don't really have any science or technology. It would need to be an innate magical ability, which is a fancy way of saying "dev handwave".
---
Fck, typo. My bad. Thou shalt henceforth be known as "eaSyRova"
---
How the fuck did that happen? Edited it. Btw, you were a nice podcast today over at guildnews, dude.
---
The meat was going to drop in price regardless with the rate they drop at.
---
Asking the important questions.
---
Was able to get to 500 by doing this!
---
Did that get revealed? I thought this was just Gorrick wondering if "he" is an appropriate label for something sentient that they know nothing about. Unless women and strangers are also LGBT.
---
&gt;Taimi never mentioned anything involving this, it was Gorrik's note.
---
Oops, my bad.
---
&gt; [them clearly being the Elder Dragons as a whole, not Jormag alone]
---
I'm sorry, the Elder Dragons are a team now? Jormag persuades people to join the other dragons?
---
&gt;Gorrik [who has never shown even the slightest inclination to care about something like this]
---
Riiight. Gorrik has shown no interest in learning about Elder Dragons. That seems legit. Additionally, you do know that people can share their interests and get other people interested in things, right? Gorrik and Taimi spent a lot of time working together.
---
Oh piss off hypocrite. I was polite, you were a lazy no effort asshole. Don't cry about being called out on it now
---
ok saved
---
I mean, these Dragons can reproduce asexually. That's about as nonbinary as one can get.
---
I understand it. I played off and on a ton over the years till like 1 1/2 years ago when i joined a guild. The guild was dead and the gh was blocked off for over a month for a future guild event. Random guild members asked if i would like to join them for some wvw fun and after awhile of being in the guild after that we all just left and joined up with a much smaller group and we had a blast together just playing random shit and wvw shenanigans and one of the people that pulled me away from the shit guild was able to get me into a good raiding group and learn to raid and ive been playing almost everyday since then. Sadly shes the only one from the second guild i still talk to since we all had a falling out. Became one of my best friends who helped me get into content i couldnt before and helped me love the game i was playing. It takes time but youll randomly find the 1 group that really makes you find what you were looking for
---
&gt;  Let me just say real quick how much I love people coming out of the woodwork and commenting. I *will* update. 
---
:O I know I haven't posted in 3 weeks but I am currently working on a collection they take time, be easy on me😭😭
---
As a wow refugee myself I can confirm. Wiki is the best data source. Metabattle is ok for some build templates but I recommend to align it to personal preferences. Snow crows for raid info. Gw2skills as a calculator. Arcdps as dps meter.
---
Community here is way WAY more positive and helpful so yeah, feel free to speak with ppl in game - not like in current wow.
---
One More thing - do not go into forums pvp section. Just don't go there. There's only hate and grief there. I feel like active ppl there are from different games and they are not really feeling gw2 dynamics yet.
---
That's just how much ArenaNet cares about these things for you.
---
In any case, if someone thinks I'm biased because I'm Spanish myself, just look at the first post of this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4zc9ir/david_ortiz_is_leaving_arenanet_this_friday/ that's WoodenPotatoes himself praising him.
---
I don't want to say the partner program wouldn't exist without him, but yeah, pretty much.
---
He's been gone for 3 years, and the overall decline of quality has been more than obvious. These kind of guys should be the ones leading the company, instead of the psychopaths we have now.
---
Here is a video with [good tips for new players](https://youtu.be/Mf56mu6O4fM).

Try playing more like Skyrim: explore and follow your sense of adventure instead of the content guide.  It's difficult to mess things up for other players, so don't be afraid to help them or ask for help.

[wiki.guildwars2.com](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) is a fantastic resource.

Look into build guides after you're more familiar with the game, it's not worth worrying about at the beginning.  Try out all your skills/weapons to learn your class.

.......say "it" instead of he or she.
---
Boom, fixed any gendered article.
---
Its always "use at your own risk". If they chose to ban me for using something that makes populated areas bearable, then so be it. The Dx12 mod is nothing but god sent and should have been worked on to be pushed into the core files the second it got released by a modder, especially considering the fact that most of the released content is open world "50 players with 6 different infusions and glittering gemstone outfits each" content.
---
Things like These that dont directly hurt previus ANet Statements are legal until ruled otherwise. 
---
Theyll never endorse it outside of their Company (might buy it tho) for legal and support reasons
---
Some food from the legendary collections can be used to level up to 500 cheaply too.
---
Well, besides some extended periodes not playing and investing my time in other things I enjoy, I still find this a considerable amount for my standards. The fun thing about this is that there is still, even after 7 years, so much content for me to proces. This game is more long term, casual fun for me and I wouldn’t want to burn out playing too much. The game isn’t going anywhere. Also, seeing there are no subsciption fees, I can come and go as I please.
---
They reworked the whole trait system back then, and it was put on live with HoT.
---
Sons of Svanir, the Suspicious Travelers \[who are NEW and added as enemies controlled by Jormag NOW\] and Skaald Stjarna, from the DURMAND PRIORY.
---
But sure, just the Sons of Svanir.

---
Thank you. I love you.
---
Fluffy! Very nice job.
---
Trust me, there is. It's a whole different ball game of wokedom. LA is not even as bad as SF, but SF and Portland are the epicenters of this malady.
---
And it's not that it's a majority opinion even in those places, but there is much published on how motivated, loud minorities can often force the majority to cave in to all sorts of outrageous demands (some papers put a threshold around 20% of a minority can start to have impact on the social culture and policies applied in the place they act on).
---
Most people are absolute cowards and that's how these activists succeed, by bulldozing over people with no spine who throw their own peers under the bus so long as they can stay unscathed and progress materially by having others be the scapegoat.
---
people talking shit even though there are partners that haven't played the game in 2 years and partners who had 11 viewers while bigger streamers got passed cause white male, the whole program is a joke
---
I like that one but play rev so it's hard to want to make it.
---
It's the worst spec in the game right now. Even comparing to cores.
---
But he transformed into all sorts of animals for that.
---
they won't whitelist 3rd party apps apart from some very specific cases for like Arcdps.  
---
But, it doesn change game files, it doesn't read memory, it doesn't interact with or automate any inputs into the game. So its just about as safe to use as stuff like Taco and Reshade.
---
 It intercepts render calls and since that's the final output of the game to screen it can't really remove, alter or add stuff to it since all draw calls and calculations are already completed. It just visually enhances and improves the performance of the render pipeline mainly.
---
of course no guarantees are given but it's almost certainly safe
---
Does it affect all characters or just the one who did the collection?
---
so are you using it right now? and you're fine? how much fps gain do you see?
---
Oh fuck, I remember this post now. And this thread. Yeah, you're onto something here. I agree with everything you said.
---
&gt;the point is the devs are ok with joking
---
Oh no, the audacity
---
&gt;about fringe, disgusting
---
Subjective
---
&gt; fetishes 
---
Might want to look up what fetish means, this is just a joke romance novel cover of two canon characters whose ship happened to be really popular.
---
And even if it were, it's not uncommon for game writers to joke about this kind of stuff (like describing objects with a sexual connotation, such as shackles or phallic-shaped items, which are fetishistic in nature).
---
&gt;and some people unironically eat it up (see the title of this this thread). Them putting in weird borderline zoophilia/furry/whatever you want to call it crap is as weird as them talking about how rox likes to be pissed on or something. Just because fans like to "ship" one over the other doesn't make it any less gross or weird.
---
But nah I am just intolerant because I think people's weird fetishes have no place in the game
---
1. There's no "eating up", it's a funny reference. 
---
2. Furry is not zoophilia, or a fetish.
---
3. There's nothing suggesting that someone might getting pissed on the face, that's a disingenuous slippery slope. I know bigots are a bit slow up in the head so I'll keep this simple and repeat it until it sticks.
---
&gt; Taco and Reshade.
---
???
---
He still fucked.
---
&gt; Nah, it's just gay furry fanfic, most likely. Neither Blizzard nor J.K. Rowling are in charge of writing plot for GW2, so I wouldn't expect this kind of development in the near future.
---
I don't remember blizzard retroactively changing someone's sexual orientation, this just reads like a weird thinly veiled aversion to gay characters or stories in general.
---
In that case, once I figure out what I want to play, should I pop one of my instant 80 scrolls and just play through the content downleveled?
---
Wouldn't they have to ask Jormag what s(he) identifies as? Seems like a pretty rude misstep to assume Jormag's gender just because they know one dragon.
---
1. This article has already been posted here.
---
2. This is an alt-right incel troll page you are linking to.
---
3. the article is garbage. It calls including enby characters  in a piece of art "linguistic authoritarianism", while itself suggesting they should never ever be part of games (thus actually having an authoritarian position).
---
4. Whats your problem with Jormarg being enby? Like... how exactly does it affect you personally.
---
5. "Going" Woke? Have you played GW2?
---
You're gonna need something stronger than fire if you want to make this even hotter.
---
Yeah if you break out of rata sum instead of porting you back to the nearest waypoint it throws you in jail.

For basic questions, best thing would probably be ask other players. Also if you are F2P and need to buy something from the TP, feel free to ask others as well. Pretty much you run around and do hearts, you have access to all 5 starting zones, so you can hop around. If you are high enough level to do world bosses, you can do them.
---
ANet will never respond and I believe ArcDPS is the only third party tool that has been officially given an OK. Even Taco has not been officially approved even though they advertise it on Twitter sometimes.
---
DX12 mod is most likely safe and ANet is unlikely to do anything about it. We can't promise that as ANet could always change their minds but it is not cheating and not giving any advantage to those who use it versus those who don't. Argument can be made that better performance of the game is an advantage but that can be acquired by dropping $3000 on a new PC too. Since the tool has been originally posted here I have not seen a single report of a ban so as far as we are concerned here, it's safe, but we still say use at your own risk because ANet has never and most likely will never come out and say anything about it.
---
I believe anything hard narrative wise should be an interesting challenge (at least it is for me), not - "we said it on forums".
---
Actually it’s fact. Your delusional to think the vocal minority represents the community. I know from reliable sources that the event was deemed a great success with incredible increases to the player base and POF sales. 
---
Reddit’s whining proves zero about the communities POV or the success of what has happened. Reality is the last few years have seen many influxes of new players. Not opinion. Straight fact!
---
What an odd disparity. On the one hand, there's probably nothing in the world that I want *less* than the Tyrian Gazette. On the other hand, I think it's freakin' awesome that they crushed their financial goal and got 1120 backers.
---
lol, you guys instantly drove this person away.  that's one of the funniest things ive seen since the announcement.
---
and yeah, generally the game has a good community (outside of pvp)
---
Yes, you need to log in at least once during the period the living story chapter was released. As in, if you log in now, you unlock the last chapter of season four.
---
Tweet deleted... but looking at the other comments of this thread, this is some drama shitstorm I can live without.
---
&gt; But how do you show that someone is Trans or Non-Binary? That‘s kind of harder. A Trans person you might be able to detect if that person is early in transition or doesn‘t have the money for it, but later on you won‘t see much of a difference. In these cases you kind of have to tell.
---
If you can't show it it doesn't have relevance to the story. Someone who enjoys crossdressing but gets into trouble for it, or a mesmer maintaining their "trans" identity via magic and other mesmers picking up on that fact, things like that can show some basic aspects and fit into the established world.
---
The demand for overt representation is just stupid flame-baiting when the ultimate point you are trying to argue is "we're just normal people same as you". If a trans person can live their entire life as the gender they identify as and no one ever notices their birth certificate states something different what exactly is the problem for said trans person?

You fought it before or after he was nerfed?
---
Oh definetly it shouldn‘t just be „we said it on the forums“.
---
I think it would be cool to discover how the dragons procreate and thus we learn of their biology, etc.
---
That would probably be an easy way to say „oh they‘re all kind of genderless and if they eat enough magic they lay eggs“ or what ever.
---
How often do you wvw? How much wvw experience do u have? Anyone with enough knowledge about wvw, can get all the things needed to get the warclaw without the need of a zerg, simply following the zerg especially the ones that use the mount isn't smart. Relying on the zerg is even worse. Learn to wvw without relying on others, watch videos, watch anything going on in each map, listen to team chat, find a friend if you really cant do anything solo.
---
They are there to let people be nice to the community and share them, just because somebody found a way to be an arse doesn't mean it should be taken away.
---
What? Those are 3rd party add-ons.
---
I was ignoring it but thanks for the heads up. I will do this just for the free and easy money.
---
having a weird error - gw2-64.exe - entry point not found
---
the procedure entry point _W_Getdays could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcrt.dll.
---
I've checked and this msvcrt.dll. is inside my system 32 folder in windows. I'm using windows 7 and never installed any mods for guild wars 2.
---
Ya, was really tired when I wrote that, and falling asleep, realized duh. Thank you :)
---
Seems the post has been deleted.
---
People keep holding on to the presentation like it was supposed to be more then it was when it was never promoted as such. 
---
The presentation was clearly meant for people who didn't know of GW2 and create hype for the game at PAX. 
---
ArenaNet made a bad decision in not tempering people's expectations at all prior to the event (Not learning from Blizzard....). Would've been great if they had a complete marketing plan and announced the release of these additional materials they've released since the event during the event.
---
It's been a while, but I used to it a fair bit years ago. Mostly then was most efficient to go from place to place with a group to capture.
---
So just expect people to have multiple gear sets on hand? Are you even allowed out of that special story instance to buy new gear if you want to? It's not like you can call in an alt.
---
Expecting someone to change their build in this game is not realistic. I say this as someone with almost a dozen arcdps templates set up for my Guardian alone.
---
Just bandwagoning in the anti anet train to get more money out of his channel. Honesty don’t think I’ve ever even heard of him...
---
nothing, but you forgot which sub you're on.
---
yes by all means make the new mats worth even less for your own gain~!
---
Mithril pollution is real. Damn Iron Legion.
