Many many GW2 players have said they will be playing WoW Classic.

---
No it isn't.
---
Was it worth it?
---
This is why I always had a few packets of salt in my inventory whenever I played PvP. I would just mail it to them with a GG message after they messaged me like this lmao
---
And people say Anet doesn't add jumping puzzles anymore.

Still love your songs, but I admit I still remember the comment of someone pointing that you should have just watch porn in place of.. Well everything that started that drama.

i disagree on veganism being hard

yeah, sylvari are sentient concious beings. if real world plants like that existed it would be immoral to eat them too.

I like SO, hate Siren's Reef. I do like Nightmare and Twilight Oasis, I wish Twilight Oasis had a CM though.

PM me your IGN.

An haiku will be included with our transaction.
---
&gt; No, I want you to do the event. Not leech. Why make me do the event, so you can get your loot. That's just fucked. That you think it's okay is even more fucked.
---
The thing is 90% of the people in the meta event are leeching, they have shit gear, don't know how to play their class and are always downed because they don't dodge.
---
If you want people to stop leeching, You need punishing encounters but people don't want that, they want participation rewards. 
---
So long as participation rewards exist, people will leech. That's the game design, You can't blame players for taking advantage of it.
---
&gt;People are all working toward a common goal.
---
some are giving 100%, others are showing up on their nomads thief and fucking around.
---
&gt; I don't think you standing there doing nothing is making my life easier.
---
Good, because I don't do that. I zone in after the loot is open, like I said.
---
I don't enjoy AB and I'm not really bothered about random peoples feelings - It's not like you LOST anything by me not helping because the map is almost always full.
---
I'm also not entirely sure why you feel entitled to have random people "Make your life easier."
---
&gt;I don't do that thing in WvW either, but I think the difference there is that people are forced to do WvW if they want a legendary and some really aren't comfortable there. 
---
Ridiculous double standard you have there.
---
Some people aren't interested in PvE either, ever thought about that? If they want a legendary they are forced to spent considerably more time in PvE than the amount of time required in WvW.
---
&gt;Everyone should be able to participate in the Octovine and no one needs it. In fact, in the WvW example, you're not really leeching since you have to at least do stuff to keep your participation up, even if it's just escorting Dolyaks which helps the side.
---
Sure and in the AB example you're not really leeching because you have to have done events for keys to open the chests.
---
You do need auric dust for gen2 legendarys, so that's incorrect.
---
Both are leeching, You're just trying to justify one.
---
Not to mention a lot of them just pay the commander for participation and stand in spawn - Fully leeching and taking up a map spot from players who actually want to play.
---
Just take healer and they will take care of any negative effects of instabilities. Instabs are just annoying as fuck. Not fun, not challenging to deal with. Since fractals are repeatable endgame content, instabs should make (especially older fractals) more interesting and fun. Current instabilities are far from that...
---
Trying but not doing well is not leeching.
---
  
---
The WvW example isn't a double standard. No one is doing work for me. I have to do it myself to keep participation up.
---
I guess we have different definitions of leeching.
---
Semantics, shmantics!
---
I look forward to your Haiku
---
I always maxed my gear, even the uw stuff. I still hate those as I get lost so fast I just wait for the rest of the group to finish it as I stay dead.
---
Can i have one?
---
Ranked’s really nice because people hardly ever spout off. It’s usually quiet except for “inc mid” and “inc home.” It’s very relaxing for me
---
&gt; Trying but not doing well is not leeching.
---
People who show up in nomads gear are not trying. They have no intention of trying to be useful, They are playing purely for their own self enjoyment - Which is fine. They are however relying on being carried by other players because if everyone did it, metas wouldn't get done.
---
&gt;The WvW example isn't a double standard. No one is doing work for me. I have to do it myself to keep participation up.
---
You have to kill a guard every couple of mins, woo, you're contributing so much.
---
That's if you don't pay the commander/are in commanders guild to just give you participation so you can stand in spawn.
---
------
---
The bottom line is this - I don't leech AB though I will leech other metas occasionally because they are boring and I need certain things to progress with what I'm working towards (They also have all the ridiculously rare infusion drops.)
---
So yes, until there is an even spread in rewards across the game or I am not required to do content I don't enjoy. I will continue to leech, I don't feel bad about that, nor care if a randoms persons feelings are hurt. This is the downside to having participation rewards - This is what the playerbase wants, I'm just rolling with it.
---
This goes to show that there's not an atempt at market manipulation behind every large purchase like many in this subreddit are quick to claim. Sometimes humans just don't behave rationally and do stuff for the lulz.
---
It feels really good doesn't it, when you're on the side and they don't focus you and you're playing a big nuke class, like this or ele. Are you FC by any chance?
---
Yes there's also flaming.

You aren’t wrong but I feel like we are at the level of debating our favorite STD

---
No shit? My buff bar has a ton of useless information, in wow you can literally filter specific buffs/debuffs you want to appear and make them appear anywhere on screen with different effects like flashing and highlighting, different sizes, sound effects and whatever you want basically. it's hard when you play wow for many years and are used to that type of QoL to come to gw2 and see how annoying it is to keep track of the small icons in the bottom of the screen
---
No, I think that would make it a meat burger.
---
Quite literally every comment he/she make is either a troll comment or a hate comment
---
How many berries tho?
---
Not contributing to the overall score in a war that most people don't care about, including most WvW vets is not leeching. It's not a specific event. And you are contributing by escorting Dolyaks because you're upgrading goals. I've done a lot of Dolyak escorting. 
---
But a limited time even that is just sitting there is completely different. 
---
I doubt,. seriously doubt, a significant portion of the population is using nomads gear. They may not all be using zerkers, but if you know something about the game at all, you're not using nomads in PvE. In which case most people just have a random mix of what's dropped without paying any attention to it.
---
To them without knowing they're trying. Doesn't mean they're succeeding. Leeching is something you do intentionally in my mind anyway. If we can't agree on that, we'll have to agree to disagree.
---
&gt; And of course instabilities can be ignored.
---
Sure, that's why we don't have a thread about it, right? ;)
---
No, I meant like the Flameseeker Prophesies precursor and such.

---
My comment on this is based on my 8 years’ experience in software development.  Apologies in advance for the Project Management jargon in my post.  
---
Traditionally ANET’s problem with GW2 has largely been the people that are operating in the Project Management and Release Management roles (not to be confused with people in Director/Executive positions).  If the last couple of years is anything to go by, the Project/Release Managers for GW2 are severely out of touch with the general playerbase.  This is why people are expecting a "don't you guys have phones" type announcement.  
---
There have been some rumours as well as concept art posted on social media that suggests one of the cancelled projects was a mobile phone game.  It’s not entirely possible that Mike Z or someone else in a Project Management role could have revived or reworked the mobile phone game project.  
---
Generally when it comes to project management, a software project has to be in line with the business strategy.  A mobile phone game would be a quick and easy source of revenue for ANET.  It wouldn’t be hard for something like this to get approved by the project board as “more money” is typically something in line with “every business strategy”. 
---
In terms of what the mobile phone game could be, my guess would be a very simple card game or a puzzle game.  ANET generally favour software projects that require minimal resources.  A mobile phone game is something that can be developed by a small team of developers (maybe 1 - 2 artists and 1 - 2 programmers).  
---
Lastly, my personal observation is that GW2 has had a fairly rapid decline over the past 2 years.  In all honesty, now is the time for ANET to play their “get out of jail card”.  ANET absolutely needs to announce something on August the 30th that is genuinely exciting and something the player base wants (e.g. Square announcing the FF7 Remake).  If the announcement on August the 30th is a "don't you guys have phones" announcement than ANET (and Mike Z in particular) will be in serious trouble.
---
Sword/Shield Glint/Jalis Herald is so survivable. I've been enjoying it lately. It's fun to play in groups with 100% boon duration, too.
---
Sounds like you were coddled and played easy mode in WoW. Knowing how to read your buffs/condi is part of the skillcap in this game, it separates the bad players from the good.
---
I was hoping to open a franchise right here in Lion's Arch, actually
---
&gt;You are still making wrong asumptions. I'm fine with spending money. I even said so. "I would be ok with even an expensive subscription fee if I'd get something worth the money." You are obviously not able to read.
---
Well then, answer the question I asked you, instead of repeatedly parroting "you can't read" as you demonstrate your own incredibly selective reading ability. Let's recap:
---
You are apparently willing to spend money if a game is worth it. You have said that FFXIV is worth the price of it's subscription. You have also said that GW2 is not worth its price, and you do not think it releases enough content to be worth playing. You believe FFXIV does do this. **Why do you not leave and play ffxiv? Why are you bothering with GW2 when FFXIV has everything you need?**
---
Either answer that question or don't bother responding, because I'm getting tired of you avoiding giving any answer that would expose your entitlement (Not sharing your /age, not explaining why you're still playing gw2 when you think it does everything wrong, not explaining how you only got 50h of content out of PoF but you're still here 2 years later). Answer those questions and maybe you won't come off as a cheap freeloader because at the moment you still reek of it.
---
&gt;I'm complaining about GW2 not releasing the same amount as other buy to play games.
---
Share your /age and let's be the judge of that, so far you've provided zero evidence of GW2 lacking content (In fact, you just admitted that the idea that "GW2 has big problems" is subjective, which is the opposite of evidence). Let's see some hard evidence for your above claim once and for all. Time played per € spent is the only fair quantitative judge of value, because every hour **you willingly spend in GW2** is less money you would spend on other games. So in a sense, by playing GW2 even though you hate it, Anet have saved you, as someone who would otherwise "have no problem paying for things", potentially hundreds of Euros. Sounds like a good trade for 30€ to me. Those hundreds of Euros that GW2 has saved you should surely be put to a good use, say, purchasing optional cosmetic items to support the company that has kept you occupied for 7 years?
---
But answer my FFXIV question first, because you'll need a real good answer to explain that massive freeloader-shaped hole in your argument, or I'll just have to keep assuming you're a cheap bastard, my dear.
---
It's not so much about making the content harder that's the issue, it's that it doesn't feel particularly fun doing it that's the issue to me. Hard bosses can be designed in a fun way. Remember when legendary imbued shaman was the ultimate pug killer back during the fotm 50 days? Most people I knew who played back then found it a very fun boss and he didn't have any gimmicky mechanics, just extremely punishing attacks. Pretty much none of the new fotm bosses are fun to fight at all to me because they're trying too hard to make them convoluted and annoying.
---
It's not about being coddled or not it's about bad design that was done to be pretty instead of functional. I prefer having my buffs on the top of the screen than the bottom right, i prefer having my health to the left of the screen than in the bottom. Just having a simple tool like they had in GW1 where you can drag the UI and place it has you want would go a long way to making the game more acessible. 
---
Artificially creating difficulty because you want users to be locked in some arbitrary default UI is just bad game design and unfun imo. It's very hard to get new players in gw2 pvp and a bad user interface for competitive gameplay is definitely one of the reasons for it. Being forced in the same ui whether you in a city or in a high end pvp tournament is just completely insane to me and it is for people that come from other mmo's with more modern UI options aswell.
---
I don't even know if modern is the right word because arenanet already had it right in 2004 in a game that revolved around the pvp scene much more than gw2. Just feels like another case of wasted features from gw1 for stupid reasons
---
I wish they'd brush up underwater combat and added more stuff to do underwater too. Fun stuff, not like "make them have to do underwater events even if it sucks because this is the only way to get x and y". I hope for the day when we can see a full zoned underwater city. 
---
Tbh, even if they tried to beta come mechanics by making a VIP zone, where there are Quaggan, Largos NPCs, the zone can have Water Vortex and Underwater Currents for fast travel.
---
[...!](https://imgur.com/a/VH7erms)
---
And I agreed to these points (maybe it wasn't clear). But UW combat is still not that bad that any UW content (like the fractal) is so hard that you have to skip it. Take a decent build and it's easy to kill everything, even in the UW fractal, even with sluggish and clunky gameplay.

Breaking out the maps in Open World only matter for aesthetics purposes, nobody cares at all. Breaking out of the map in WvW can give a team a big advantage over the others, it's literally an exploit.

[First paragraph of this page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer)
---
**J. Robert Oppenheimer**
---
Julius Robert Oppenheimer (; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. Oppenheimer was the wartime head of the Los Alamos Laboratory and is among those who are credited with being the "father of the atomic bomb" for their role in the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. The first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on July 16, 1945, in the Trinity test in New Mexico. Oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." In August 1945, the weapons were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

So are my stacks of burgers; I'm pretty sure I'll never see the sun again.
---
I really, really, really need this to happen. Seriously.
---
I think many people would prefer having normal combat skills available underwater at this point. Not that GW2 UW is bad, just that it's still worse than overland. And there's little point in making it better unless they create more underwater content.
---
I tend to keep my reward tracks on dungeon ones that give dungeon tokens and dungeon weapon boxes. When I get 4 weapon boxes I turn em into greatswords and use the mystic forge conduit as an attempt to get a precursor weapon. I've had 2 precursors that way. One was worth around 140g, and the other was around 300 or 400g from memory. I tried using 3 exotic dungeon greatswords with a mystic stone, but found out it doesn't always reward a greatsword exotic, so I now use 4 exotic greatswords to guarantee that, if I do get a precursor, it's definitely one of the more valuable greatsword precursors.
---
It's a little funny when you remember one big selling point of the game they drove home was the idea of a world without boundaries and the mountains naturally cutting things off when they got too steep. That went away with the mounts and Path of Fire.

Not quite the jump I was expecting.

For this boss rush event, are we included in all five tiers of rewards if the community as a whole turns enough in, or do we need to turn in a certain amount to be included in each individual tier?
---
[removed]
---
I did it for a bit in Kessex Hills as that is one of the more profitable maps this week for a bit while I was there opening Pact Supply bags and doing some map completion. The event itself isn't mind blowing or particularly worth it if your goal is to get gold and/or rewards.
---
However it is better than what we have had between LW seasons and big releases in the past which was essentially nothing. Heck we didn't even have festivals at all at one point besides Halloween and Wintersday when Dragon Bash, Queen's Gauntlet and Four Winds were just segue events for LW episodes.
---
Could this Champ Rush event be better and more engaging? Of course. Are the rewards a little lackluster? For some yes. My point is that this better than nothing at all (not that that should be the standard for game engagement) and that the event is something to do for veterans as well as F2P players while doing other things on the maps.
---
Like, "Oh right champs are a little more valuable right now and there is a goal to work towards." (Hoping events like this function correctly in the future)
---
Yeah, man. TO CM would be awesome.
---
Champion trains are worth doing it, now you get additional loot. Easy math.
---
No its not faster as in your hand movements, its faster because it cancels the skill but has no animation like stowing your weapon does. Woodenpotatoes was showing it off on a livestream and it allows you to cancel cast more things than just stow weapon does.
---
GW2 has a great community!   Yeah, you'll come across a troll or two, but from my experience, most people are really, really  cool.  If you're looking for people to do stuff with, you can always ask in map chat if anyone wants to join you... or use the LFG.  Also, check out the guilds who are actively recruiting - you have up to 5 guild slots, so don't be afraid to join a few and see how they are &amp; if you like them.  If you don't, there are hundreds more out there...
---
You're welcome to join mine - we're a group of very casual players.  We have folks from all over, but the majority of us are in the states and we do pretty much everything (although quiet a few are WvW focused).  Oh, I should probably tell you our ONE measly requirement:  **don't be an ass**.  PM me if you're interested in checking us out.

It was not a joke and there is real scientific evidence that plants have a reaction analogous to the pain response found in animals, which is why I earnestly extend the same ethical respect to plants as I do to animals. Get with the frontiers of biology.
---
Veganism already has a bounty of very good arguments for its case and we should all move farther toward it. But the ethical argument is a load of bollocks, for the opposite reason people think. Plants feel pain and suffer too.
---
I help a lot of people get into the game but I don't probably have the time to play the entire game from the beginning, even though I play with returning and new players quite a bit. Add me, though, Vayne.8563. There's a lot of stuff that I can show you that you wouldn't normally find just randomly.
---
I don't think any of these events have been "worth it", just do them if you actually enjoy them.
---
The event is bugged, so what anet are doing is as long as you've participated (spend your champ mark's at the collectors) you'll get all five tiers of rewards once the event has ended.
---
Milk and eggs, bitch.
---
So what?  I dont know that wall did not exist before because why would I bother to memorise that?
---
Was there any expensive ones at the end?
---
It's definitely a power weapon and its still pretty bad at that. Staff is better against organized groups, lb is more fun to play though =D
---
I think it's fun, that's my point. I'm enjoying it, because my focus isn't gold per hour. I've done champs almost every day, just for the hell of it, because it's more rewarding than it used to be, and I'm playing with guildies. Solo to just farm, if that's all your interested in, not really worth it. But I don't think even most vets play that way.

Doing something because it's fun? What nonsense is this?!

Joking aside, yeah shouldn't that be the reason any of us are here? If it's fun, do it. If not, do something else.
---
The underlying design of the ESO Cyrodiil Alliance War is better than WvW. The balance and build variety is better. Both game modes have performance issues.
---
Both arena pvp modes have issues. Spvp is completely stale with no variety. ESO BGs lack proper matchmaking and no ranked mode but has much greater variety  with several game types and many maps with more being added.
---
I've had no problems using healing power in pve and open world. My druid uses harrier, my scourge uses marshal, my weaver uses trailblazer (along with Strength of Stone) and I perform a lot better on those classes where I otherwise didn't as a result. This player base has a fanatic obsession with meta builds and efficiency that the only reason it's not the worst community of gamers I've ever met is that other MMOs exist, but I've certainly don't get insulted in FPS games or survival multilayers nearly as much if I try to break the mold to my own happiness.
---
I mean really, it's open world and story. If there's helpful advice that makes it easier, there's always some dingus chiming in with "learn to dodge."
---
One of my favorite things in "vanilla" were the jumping puzzles. I remember raging, but damn if getting to the end wasn't satisfying. The WvW jumping puzzle was probably the best, I think I spent an entire day doing just that puzzle the first time through because I was genuinely lost.

So I'm all for it!

I will not be hypocritical, at first I hated JP's a lot, but over time I began to enjoy them. JP's are good for killing time and challenging yourself to reach the end.

It's the food that gives you the cleanse and it only applies to you. The interaction with the heal skill is just what triggers it. Think of it like a trait that removes a condition when you heal.

I guess it's worth killing at least one boss, since we now get all the rewards for free.. lol

I'm trying to roleplay an episode of strange addictions in Tyria.

TBH I've never been able to tell any difference between minion mancer and a non-minion counterpart. Reapers shroud is just strong in its own right, scourge can heal A LOT using parasitic contagion. It just seems like a waste of not bringing any other skills to the table.

Did it have the highest cooking stat? Or maybe it reached max first?

IDK about kalla legend, I mostly camp shiro. Kalla's fervor is just a strong buff. I don't personally use it because glint is way easier and I like it more (plus I don't want to make another rev). But still, it's a strong buff that can compliment shiro well.

Don't. Hold off until 30th August. The future of this game depends on that day.

We're sort of starved of on-foot JPs in PoF and LWS4, so yes please. The dwarven ruins with the Light of Deldrimor in Thunderhead Peaks satisified that itch, though. Hopefully similar content in the future has good rewards/replay value just like it!

Anet talking about that so much before launch was the reason that, during beta, I actually reported every time I ran into an invisible wall.  They said that the maps should feel natural and that we'll never walk into an invisible wall, but they were everywhere.  And it's so much worse now.
---
One quality of life update that I would love would be to remove invis walls from pve, and make all invis walls in competitive formats visible instead.
---
I'm sending you an order via PM, I expect my order to be fulfilled in a timely matter, otherwise I'm rating you ~~1-star~~ 1-VeggieBurger on all of the review sites.
---
Absolute madman
---
Sorry, I don't know too much about computers, it runs around 50 fps for me at mid settings, maybe that helps?
---
I don't quite understand this boss rush event. How do I know the next area it'll spawn?
---
Sure, that would work. A screen shot of when you created your account, your character select screen showing 2 characters and /played on those 2 characters.
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Ah. Ellen x Evon. We don't judge
---
Wtf is “Chinajoy”?
---
does this work for you ?  https://gyazo.com/4c551712fa5e903bf15150e47a16c86c
---
The whole idea behind instabilities is to give anet tool to interfere with gameplaywothout touching( or adding) content. This is, as expected, lazy in design and annoying in combat. Instabilities dont increase difficulty, they increase annoyance. It feels like anet dont want you playing fractals at all
---
oh i must correct i didn't level the 2nd account 
---
i used the level up thing in the beginning to get the raptor mount
---
The issue with the skyscale was never how 'hard' it is but the timegating and the grind.
---
Chinese E3
---
When Ascalon was not even your lands to begin with... right... The sole fact you stayed in "your Ascalon" was enough to prove your support to the King, you had still 4 other kingdoms you could have went to -&gt; Kryta, -&gt; Orr -&gt; Elona -&gt; Cantha.   
---
Your King stole OUR hunting grounds.
---
Also you just proven my point that Kalla was mostly helpful to your cause, she even died as a soldier, and not a coward like your King!
---
Ah, I remember my first true disappointment of Guild Wars 2, wasn't even that long after release. When I found out that while Rangers and Warriors proc their ghost sharks on attacking, I only do from the #2 skill.
---
I like them but would also like some simpler ones to be added, not exactly another Searing Ascent.
---
not gonna lie, this game is alot of fun and i will continue to put more time into the game but the motivation i had to get all the story mounts was insane so yah i played a bit everyday :)
---
Aaaaah, **yes**! I need this. Those two are my absolute favorite personal story characters.
---
And then there is the not existing heal under water and my favroite bug since the water rework, the trident necro 1 skill provide 2 not 2% life force... wtf anet
---
its probably much higher account wise. to be honest people kinda underestimate how many people tend to play f2p games. and usually companies count players as somebody who logs in atleast once a month
---
Yesterday a pain in the ass with boons on enemy - glad i was scourge ...
---
Still a better job marketing than anet.
---
And 3 persons make a WvW team with a traitor!
---
Idc about jp. Just give elite spec.
---
There should be at least one JP per map. Preferably more. Preferably all jumping puzzles all the time.
---
Well for condis , which is also a pain point for Engi and Holo has to have the right utilities and traits at the cost of personal DPS. Swap things around to fit the situation or need.
---
If you’ve done that already, perhaps look up those builds that are countering you and gauge what their rotation or agenda is.
---
Bait out their key skills and attacks. Make them burn their cool downs and get them while they’re in ICD.
---
For example, a lot of holos, myself included want to gap close to get a corona burst. Knowing that it’s important that players avoid that coming burst by keeping distance, dodging or using a skill to avoid unnecessary damage.
---
Restarting a character from zero ? Never more. This is my last mmo. I started when I had time
---
 Now I have a daughter . Spending thousands of hours again? Naaa
---
It's not the gameplay it's the commitment to the current game. Why do you think there are so many people playing wow? They spent too much time to stop
---
Maybe it's just sodomy.
---
If not timed I'd be ok. I hate Halloween puzzle or wintersday's one but I love the one from sirens landing or whoever is the name of the pirate ship up on the mountain. It takes long to arrive but you can take your time and you always see where to go next ( looking at you stupid volcano JP )
---
I assure you that the ingredients are 100% all-natural and almost *definitely* do not contain traces of dragon magic. Nope.
---
I was on Queensdale then a lot of red swords spawned on the map, those were people fighting champions. Similar to the Stampede event.     
---
My question is, I can go to any Tyria map and just look for champions?
---
😆 good to hear!!
---
Who is Thanos?
---
And yet in ranked PvP you eventually can predict players in the next game...
---
Find an NA raiding guild.
---
Anet made a big mistake regarding jps. The ones in season 3 are not hard in terms of jumping, but in finding the way to get further. Some flight passes in the primordus map were simple bad game design. If they add jps like the one in the abaddon map, i would be extremly happy.
---
Me: After placements Gold1
---
next 6 games basically rofl stomping enemy team to the point where we started to troll / one dude went AFK for 3 mins mid game / ect. and we still won it hard.
---
The unlucky seventh game was a sad sad loose and maybe I was the culprit in our team.. :'(
---
Can you define optional ?
---
Not needing for completing the map ? Not needed for achieving a legendary ? Not needed for any achievement at all ?
---
More like Abaddon's Ascent please.
---
Why is Thanos ?
---
I see, thx for replying
---
Because it isn't hard. Skyscale collection requires only time and some of the LS4's currency. You won't find things that can be failed, depend on luck or you have to be skilled. No. Just takes time. And you can do it with a guide which tell you where everything is.
---
"Hard" collection can be e.g. PvE Lege armor.
---
&gt;so it's not restricted to any one particular zone
---
Sometimes I question my faith in humanity... Then someone does this. My faith is rewarded! Blessed be the Six!
---
Chicken isn't vegan?
---
Rifle Deadeye with invigorating precision.
---
I didn't like the ones from Ember Bay and Draconis Mons because there was too much try-and-error involved in finding the correct path.. I think JPs with rather obvious paths but hard execution are way better, if they do them like that I am fine with new ones..
---
No replacement for vipers, get some rabid exotics or whatever until you get hot and can get full vipers.
---
The event you saw in queensdale was independent of the champ rush, that's just a thing that happens there
---
Any champion in any core tyria map counts
---
I can no longer buy items from the trading post... would veggie burgers be ok?
---
The burger baron
---
Keep them optional, looking at you piece of shit sky scale collection forcing that shitty content on me.
---
Optional as in not fucking part of any progression paths, thank you very fucking much.
---
It’s not the same though. It’s different kind of challenge, that should be present in pve like it is in WoW, where you can take your optimized extreme exp raid squad into a raid boss and fail for hours because it’s hard.
---
[citation needed]
---
I see through your deceit. You want to exploit obesity to become an Elder Dragon. You fool me no more!
---
I could not care less.
---
&gt;If you don't want to play switch builds for content that requires switching build, then don't play this content? ;)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If you are too "tender" to switch builds, it's your own problem.
---
I fully agree and I don't play it. But isn't it the problem for ANet, that people don't play some content?;)
---
I don't have any unlocked, but I heard from someone that the selection in the recovered black lion goods box does not include mount skins that come in packs/bundles, which explains why the warclaw ones were not included.
---
you really don't wish that. just look at other mmos and games like fortnite, pubg etc.
---
This sums up the enthusiasm of the game at this point. Buying all the burgers off the tp...... yup..
---
If that was the case then the announcement wouldn't be on the 30th but somewhere in the year 3019.
---
You once we're ve-gon, now you will be-gone!
---
Kill yourself
---
Wrong. I encountered invis walls even back before HoT came out, had to even be in S1 days. I never really tried to break out of maps, I just like to explore where I can. The walls are usually in obscure places but those places are easily reachable.
---
You are seriously underestimating the work required to "change engines".
---
Sadly this
---
I actually didn't know that. Damn.
---
Weakauras...This.
---
Real life waifus
---
At the same time though, why should the game cater to the super hardcore minority? Doesn't it make more sense to focus on creating content for the casual masses?
---
That's an extreme amount of work to the point where it would be worth considering just rather making GW3.   
---
Can't just recode the game from scratch willy-nilly
---
+weird looking Sohothin and Gunblade.. watttt
---
Jumping Puzzles every new map was the first thing I wanted to do. Drydock Sratch in Silverwastes is still probably my favourite. Easy to move around and jump but hard when it comes to choosing your next path.
---
Then they started to introduce shit like Chalice of Tears which literally makes you want to cry. Tons of micro pixel jumps. Turning around corners mid air. Not a single clue where to go next because everything looks the same.
---
I'm all in for new jumping puzzles but for the love of God get rid of pixel jumps. Make it long, make it with many dead ends, but don't make me jump on the same rock 50 times because my characters slips of the edge because I didn't land on the single pixels that is supposed to hold me on it.
---
Still sad that they didn't introduce JP in high in the forest in Bitterfrost Frontier. It was such a good location to create super fun JP with not too much effort.
---
Imagine the new OP ascended food would require alot of Veggie burgers...........I see what you did there OP ;)
---
No. Odds are you'll just get a few exotics that sell for like 30 silver at best, which is far less than just straight up selling the rares you're trying to turn into exotics.
---
i'd just add to this: get a candy corn gobbler  
---
best item ever and it significantly boosts your rank and reward track progress
---
Nice.
---
Yep, reminds me of what happened in Frostgorge Sound earlier this week:
---
"Oh, this train's moving to another elite. Wait a second, these Svanir are trying to abduct some quaggan? I'm gonna wreck em!"  
---
"ASSHOLE STOPPED QUAGGAN EVENT NO QUAGGAN CHAMP"  
---
"Wh- How was I supposed to know that!?"
---
\-Shroud can tank condis, swalk helps too. 
---
\-This game is not ment to solo roam. The fact classes can do it make them just op but Anet doesnt care. 
---
\-having flash wurm helps alot in wvw. 
---
\-when you play reaper in wvw, you accept the fact that some classes would have field day on you. And the most fun part is when you get to kill them. It feels so rewarding. 
---
\-Reaper is love, Reaper is life.
---
&gt; and the mountains naturally cutting
---
&gt; n a t u r a l l y
---
Ahaha, no. Sorry, but invisble walls are more "natural" than square mountains. I don't know what immersion can you talk about  at that point.
---
So long as I can skip them for the trink3ts etc
---
Thanks I'll try that.
---
It would be nice for them to do something to help the game run smoother. To be honest I doubt that they will.
---
I did find that build out there, but many said you will be gimping yourself greatly as you won't benefit from either side.
---
i dont know, i think my life wouldve been better had i not experienced chalice of tears and searing ascent
---
Why does this thing even exist
---
This is the one time I going to give an actual guess for this, I predict a sale when the announcement happens.
---
Unfortunately, it is not worth it at all from a gold per hour point of view. As you have already started, you get mostly junk. Sure there is a tiny chance to get those infusions but you might as well farm Dragonfall and make 30g an hour. Though, you need to have an extremely efficient commander. Most commanders in Dragonfall are useless plebeians. Join a farming community and go crazy. If you're burned or bored you can go back to some low key content and hit some champs on the head. I want to add a little disclaimer as worth is subjective. Make sure you don't burn yourself out doing content you don't enjoy, just to get that shiny new thing off the gemstore. Personally, enjoy farming efficiently and buying gemstore stuff with gold. This is fun for me.
---
Champ Rush is also on, so that may cause prices for exotics drop a bit.
---
I'm not a reaper main, but I'd play reaper like this:
---
[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwAEdjlJwSYOsGWJO2LbtMA-zVZYBRFIGhchHB5NG5ThSVgwZR1XL-w](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwAEdjlJwSYOsGWJO2LbtMA-zVZYBRFIGhchHB5NG5ThSVgwZR1XL-w)
---
The whole build is focussing around chilling your oponent ALL.THE.TIME! Don't underestimate this! Chill not only makes it SUUUUUUUPER hard to kite a reaper, but it also increasing the CD's of ALL SKILLS of your oponent. Just look at this crazy build! You get +90% chill uptime and you can pulse chill inflicting abillities like a mad man.
---
The chill uptime also heavily synergize with chilling victory trait. This boosts your might generation AND your life force generation as well. I chose well of power as the "go to" defensive stunbreak skill, because... LOOK AT IT! It is pulsing 5 boons per second (=5% life force every secon = 25% life force) AND cures conditions. The shout skills are very good against mesmer, because you can easy hit multiple clonse with them = heavy increase the effectiveness and decrease their CD.
---
On top of this you got A LOT of boon corrupt, which is very powerfull against many oponents. Holo's can't deal with this, any class which is pulsing stabillity / quickness is going to RECK themselves, because these boons get turned into fear and chill (and whenever you fear an oponent, you also chill them... LOL).
---
Oh and don't forget... a chilled foe can also be chased down a lot easier and you can kite them a lot easier as well, if you ever had to.
---
&gt; Buying all the burgers off the tp...... yup..
---
Not all burgers. The meat of the matter is that there is not meat on the burger.
---
... It leaves us the good stuff...
---
I've been out of the game for a while, but have they ever made a mandatory jumping puzzle?
---
One jump puzzle in the Sylvari starting zone you can actually mount and jump to it with the rabbit+glider very easily despite the no mount zone.
---
Just reforge it?
---
But they moved it and made bigger multiple times already. You can still skip to end chest despite patches.
---
and the directions all the skeletons are pointing at
---
Ok thanks ill give it a try. I did try a different chill build. It was spite shroud and reaper.
---
I miss jumping puzzles.
---
I thought GW2 in China was dead enough to greenlight Cantha, but apparently not...
---
Yes add more, I’m a masochist
---
i still wonder if mordremoths mind was closer to a place in reality or closer to a place in the mists. he was the elder dragon of mind and natute but still, it really doesnt seem like an elder dragon to create manifestations of memories that could be turned against them, unless it had something to do with the ley energy being inherently unstable which would be interesting
---
I remember people defending it a while ago saying it represents the game with all the infusions and everything being so over the top. The fact it looked like a mobile game trailer was good to them bc it would attract people who are into that.
---
I think pvp lobby has some siege.
---
I'll take bugged outfit codes with a 3 month wait for a canceled raid.
---
Is pvp and wvw even canon to the story?
---
I’m pretty sure this is not from recent events...
---
It's the game, but I have found that sometimes disconnecting my mouse and/or blowing on the components helps. Something about GW2 aggravates this behavior, I was bitching about my right mouse button not gripping the screen just the other day and it's done it every few months over the years. Sometimes having an old mouse makes it worse, sometimes heavy lag in the game worsens it, too. I play on a laptop, one monitor, with a razer naga.
---
Welcome to the salt farming community. Enjoy your stay and your hardened arteries.
---
Well because they‘re doing a job that consists of standing around, looking pretty, and potentially smile at creepy dudes ogling them.
---
You could do this in GW1 and folks were generally (with a few exceptions) more polite about it, wishing each other luck at the start and gg at the end.
---
I think they need to remove raids, fractals and events from legendary crafting too and make them optional content. Requiring me to play with other people just isn't my thing.
---
This is glorious
---
I saw the spike on GW2BLTC and I'm glad that you shared this with us.
---
There was a topic about soul pastry being traded in large quantities and all I wanted to know is who bought all those Veggie Burgers.
---
I hope your raid squad is enjoying having to send you food because it's completely impossible for you to take it out of the TP
---
Totally. It's one of my favourite parts of the game. I only hope they would be as nicely done as the one in Tarir or Not So Secret. &lt;3
---
I like them. They add another element to the game.
---
Also, I wonder how many of the self-labeled veterans who are bored with 'no new content' and rage-quitting over the lengthy intermission between expansions and LWS episodes have done the JPs. Everyone loves to complain about nothing to do, but there are so many achievements and collections in this game, that I can *always* find something worthwhile to work on!
---
This issue sounds like you accidentally right click on an arcdps window. When you do this you cant move your camera with your mouse ofr some reason. Try to turn on "clicking requires modifiers" in arcpdps settings which will require to use alt+shift or whatever modifier yku have enabled whenever you want to use smt with arcdps
---
Would adore a citation.
---
&gt; While refusing to even publicly acknowledge the countless ways you can  now break a competitive game mode that heavily depends on not being  exploitable to actually be fair and fun. 
---
It's cute that you think ANet gives even a partial fuck about WvW.
---
Sorry, perhaps I phrased it poorly. I'm saying jumping puzzles are optional content. As such there is no reason to oppose adding them. There have been a few though that were optional but a little bit required Diessa and Dredgehaunt had a couple you needed to do for map completion. I don't think that'll happen again though.
---
I see people saying how much they enjoy PvP, and I just don't get it. PvP is the most unbalanced part in any of the games I currently play, its unfun and more frustrating than what u actually gain from it. The first 10 placement games are the biggest hell to go trough, unevenly matched against people that are way better and way higher ranked. Is it just something I am not seeing with how many people seem to love the PvP atm?
---
Few things I can tell you out of memory since I am currently on phone at work. Those places have gates leading to them in lions arch. Ambient dialog exists in capital cities we're mist warriors are trying to recruit soldiers for the mist war (wvw). At the movement of the world (a piece of text that describes what happened between the two games lore wise) it states that after the flood caused by Orr being resurfaced the battle isles (gw1 pvp lobby) went underground and Balthazar himself created a portal to the heart of the mists (gw2 pvp lobby) in LA (iirc something happened to it but I can't remember what). Other than that wiki is your friend.
---
Ha!  I still can’t find a decent raiding guild.
---
Although for fractals... if you are new and don’t know what to do.  Just ask.  Make it known ahead of time.  I’ve never been in a fractal where people weren’t willing to teach others.
---
but but you can watch  some cutscene :(
---
Well Snaff technically was he was killed while in Kralks mind.
---
los with the boon corrupt is very weird underwater, had to go like inside the boss to get it work consistently and every time a bubble would come from below and pull me up
---
Well, after two minutes of jumping and halfway mapbreaking you have earned your free entrance to the tower :D
---
most of it should be lowest settings as i play on a laptop
---
it just happened to have very annoying combo of instabilities
---
I ugly snorted when I clicked that link
---
I don't remember the exact details, it happened when I was very new, but I remember fighting an undead Tybalt. It was around where the evolved wurm fights happen. I remember thinking at the time that it was pretty messed up. Having to fight him was sad. He was the only NPC other than Trahearne and Aurene that I liked
---
"may contain traces of Bloodstone dust"
---
Me neither.
---
No one is ever really gone (tm)
---
As an older player burning down orphanages, could I qualify for a care package? My exotic armor is getting rusty and I dont have any skins for my mounts.
---
Green Goblin: THOSE HORRIBLE YELLOW EYES! At first I tried it on a human mesmer (one of the masks looks goblin-y) but I didn't like the light armour and I prefer the scale mail look.
---
Vulture: I considered the white angel wings but they looked off. It's a shame you can't dye back pieces or I would've died the bird wings white. I thought those trimmings on the gloves and boots looked nice and gave him a more feathery look.
---
[Bonus gliding gif](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlindHarshJabiru-mobile.mp4)
---
I don't think murder salad is real salad.
---
1750g, apparently.
---
&gt; corpses
---
You might want to use "carcass" instead of corpse. I don't think there is eatable human meat anywhere in GW2.
---
I first wanted to write 'playable race' instead of 'human' but then I am not so sure somehow.
---
&gt;Well then, answer the question I asked you
---
Mostly because I invested lots of time into GW2 and WvW is still fun. I'm playing other games mostly.
---
&gt;Not sharing your /age, not explaining why you're still playing gw2 when you think it does everything wrong, not explaining how you only got 50h of content out of PoF but you're still here 2 years later
---
Offtopic, but if you are that bored: time spend is ~2000h. Lots of idling or trading included.
---
I already explained the 50h of content for GW2 expansions. Not gonna repeat it endlessly.
---
&gt;Share your /age 
---
.
---
&gt;Time played per € spent is the only fair quantitative judge of value
---
I already explained long ago that this is nonsense because quality of entertainment. See free to play example. 
---
But once again:
---
Or to stick with your restaurant example: a restaurants which serves you raw potatoes only delivers more food for your money than an award winning luxury restaurant. This does absolutly not mean that you get a better service or more enjoyment out of the potato restaurant.
---
To add further examples: quality of content in Final fantasy single player games is by far better (by my taste) than GW2. So I'm willing to spend more money on those games, despite getting less "time spend" out of it. Same as you go to the cinema and pay more for it, than watching the same movie at home on your TV. Or as you go to a musical and "only" get ~3 hours of entertainment out of it - you could also watch some trash in TV for free. But musical is a much more pleasent experience (to me), than watching TV. Ofc are tastes different, so in the end it's highly subjective.
---
&gt;which is the opposite of evidence
---
Evidence for GW2 having problems are the mass lay-offs.
---
&gt;Those hundreds of Euros that GW2 has saved you should surely be put to a good use, say, purchasing optional cosmetic items to support the company that has kept you occupied for 7 years?
---
I spend it on other companies games where I get a better quality of entertainment.
---
Absolutely! Just one please, I have a small appetite.
---
They downvoted him because he spoke the truth....
---
hey, just a friendly reminder this game is called guild wars 2 not old school runescape :)
---
More please!!! Make them hell.
---
Imo playing with other people is essential in MMORPGS
---
I grinded the wintersday puzzle until it ended up an almost meditative experience. I'd put on a podcast and just completely enter the zone, only pausing to stalk through Lion's Arch past all the sweet, little orphans, eyes alight with hope, just to throw another pile of presents into my bank, hoarding them for summer when they sell for more.
---
OP trying to cash in on the recent Beyond Meat Hype i see...
---
Only the most thoughtless, ignorant, and basically hateful people would make a statement like that. Did you ever stop to consider that there might be people playing that have physical disabilities that makes jumping puzzles difficult if not impossible to do? Have you ever considered that there's other game content like PvP that needs far more attention, and that new jumping puzzles should be a very low priority until said other game content is dealt with?
---
Some people enjoy jumping puzzles. Great for them! Other people don't like jumping puzzles, and would much rather have new game content that actually matters. Don't be one of those gatekeeping gamer pricks that makes sweeping generalizations about how everybody loves such and such and anyone who doesn't is a spiteful person.
---
Not taking sides but just want to say that gaming is taking very seriously in east Asia. I recall certain if not most internet games require an ID to sign up for in  Korea and China.
---
Technically, there is a problem, as lore of Hall of Chains raid indicates that most (if not all) souls that were dying and went into River of Souls were being absorbed by Dhuum this whole time (which literally means erasing the soul out of existence) before we managed to re-seal him.
---
I would welcome them, but only if they do a top job on making sure the camera angles and collision boxes are working right. Nothing more rage inducing than hitting an invisible edge that deflects your jump so you fall. If I fail, it’s needs to be my error, not the game’s.
---
I love them as long as they're not in the mists
---
I love all [PINK] mesmers, I really do! Without you lot I would have bitten through a lot more keyboards than I already have.
---
Combine 3 shitty items with 1 mystic stone (or ecto) to create even shittier item.
---
That's how it works.
---
instabilities came pretty much at the same time with the massive reductions in the damage mobs did..as a way to compensate for that (classic example: shaman arrow used to 1 shot, now it's like 2k damage)
---
i agree, they are extremely unfun!
---
tinfoil hat time: they wanted to enforce non-dps roles that are able to remove condis and boons along with increasing passive damage to try to push healers into the mix
---
the part about people being unable to complete it due to class choices is pretty much bullshit though! every single class is able to condi cleanse, provide some boons and only 3 are unable to boonstrip(which can be solved with sigils anyway)
---
but yes, your average casual player won't bother changing build to adapt and as such they don't get to complete the fractal..fair and square
---
comparing them to raids is foolish because some encounters are harder some are easier and fractals have a lot more personal accountability than raids too!
---
This is such a useless thing to complain about... Look, complain about WvW, PvP, or Raids all you want. We all know those game modes need more attention and fixing. But this? This is almost complaining to complain. I say almost because reading through the comments it seems people really value map breaking or the idea of an “unlimited world”. That’s fine, but invisible walls are there for a reason. ANet doesn’t want people to clip outside the world, or to somehow get themselves stuck in the geometry of the world. 
---
Of course, people still manage to do that even with the invisible walls, but that’s almost always because they were specifically trying. Complaining about invisible walls blocking you from the boundaries of the map is useless, and implying ANet spends the bulk of its time and money on invisible walls is dumb. It isn’t hard to make an invisible barrier in a game.
---
[This event right here.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kill_the_Risen_commander_to_avenge_Tybalt)
---
They're available for all 3 mentors, depending on who you picked.
---
I for one loved vanilla ones,  but the ones added with the living stories sucked a bit
---
The Phase smash change makes no sense. It was like that before which made the skill a suicide button.
---
About 48 keys but I did get the mount too
---
&gt; The builds which i couldnt beat: condition thieves, condition mesmers, scrappers, revenant(some weird burst combo, harold? ), spellbreaker warrior.
---
you're a scissor and these are all rocks.
---
you have to accept that solo roaming as any class will result in a bunch of builds/situations that you can't really cope with. 
---
that's the nature of the gameplay
---
0.
---
Finishing all the jumping puzzles was literally the first “big achievement” I did in this game. 👍🏻
---
I used a  bundle of 20 keys to get statuettes for the storm dagger, got the mount but no outfit.
---
You dont need phase smash change, you need to remove 5 might on fury completely. There's no reason for a class to have permanent 25 might with no effort and almost no drawbacks.
---
zero, because I know it will be buyable with statuettes in the future, so I still use my "normal" amount of keys I always have. I didnt bought extra keys for the outfit.
---
that said: I got it from a free key, that I got through daily log ins, on one of my farm accounts, where I absolutely have no use for it... :D
---
Use spirit weapon, stand your ground &amp; bane signet.
---
Little less damage but you bring stability/ret and a power boost for the group.
---
Would be nice if traps worked underwater sure, but you can adapt.
---
I dont see a single reason for a class to ever be balanced around gvg.
---
I got one after 7 and I didn't event want it lol. I dont see what the appeal is
---
22 and I gave up, didnt get raptor neither the outfit. Only 20g skin out of all keys.
---
Its just as hard for guard.
---
While mesmer wells are 240 aoe wells the FB mantras are 180 range aoe with a narrow cone in front.
---
I got lucky. Got a couple keys in my last world completion run (honestly surprisingly many, like 2 keys for three maps) and got the Mount in the 5th or 6th chest.
---
Also dropped a key from a mob last week for the first time ever and that key gave me the outfit. Actually ridiculous tbh.
---
Other players are *jumping* to help out. Either because they can level their alt job or to get first timer bonus for endgame gears (jobs are shared on the same character there and easily swapped, complete with all saved gears with the press of a button)

0, dropped it from a key I got from login rewards. Downvotes to the left.

I actually didn't know that. What would you suggest be done to it instead? If anything at all ofc
---
That's what Anet did in sPvP and I kinda like this change idea. This would make rev need to rely more on team mates. But this also means that change would make a big difference in WvW, because there are enough might sharing team mates around to keep you buffed.
---
Okay.  What would you ballance classes around, then?
---
CONGRATS BOIS
---
On almost 70 now and havnt gotten it haha. Least I got enough statuettes for when it comes in rota :c
---
Used 24 free keys from map comps, another 10 or so from keyfarms I had saved and the rest from gold&gt;gems. What a waste lol
---
I only do the weekly key farms but I don't really care for the space diaper outfit :/
---
Bro, obviously the thief was an anet bot meant to make spvp seem more populated
---
Ve-gon?

---
Doing Skyscale collection by guide with marked locations of everything is like being carried. All you need is go to X and interact.
---
Wish I could stick to my guns on the whole "it's an outfit don't support outfits" thing. Anyway, I play human and do like how it looks.
---
I am against it, jumping puzzles are fun but most of the time a one time only thing. Rather use the dev time on repeatable content
---
I disagree. Many people like them.  
---
I also have serious doubts about the 'waste of time' argument.  
---
First of all, it doesnt take that much time to make them compared to other content so cutting them would have close to no effect on other content, and secondly: JPs are an enrichment to already existing content (maps). Something needs to be there anyway, might as well be a JP instead of some nice looking PoI that nobody ever cares about again.  
---
Im not saying it takes no time at all, but it is negligible compared to a new leggy, raids, build templates or most of the other fixes and additions you refer to. If those fixes and additions were as easy as making a JP, it would be done already.
---
Patience is not for everyone ;)
---
Made a quick recording last evening, here you go [https://youtu.be/tCNOMa2jZP0](https://youtu.be/tCNOMa2jZP0)
---
Trade 'em in for faction provisioner tokens for legendary armor, rune or sigils?
---
sure but i'd like if they rework JP rewards so that the long, checkpoint ones give special currency that you can exchange for unique items and gizmos - like they did with beetle racing. also could add super rare infusions/skins to the end-chests.
---
I miss more jumpin puzzles! I actually love that mounts are dissabled for them. It’s fun and challenging!
---

Congrats!
---
3 golden BLC keys, had a bunch of the statuettes saved up and splurged to get it with those
---
You missed the Point mate
---
The main focus isn't that they added those walls to PvE. The main focus is that they DIDN'T add them to WvW. No one will get hurt by having invis walls in PvE or not having invis Walls in PvE (imho). But not having invis walls at specific places in WvW results in [stuff like that (not fixed yet btw)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cu38cr/you_can_jump_from_blue_spawn_into_quentin_lake/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) 
---
and this is game breaking.
---
So what the OP wants to say is that if every dev that placed a new invis wall in PvE would have placed it in WvW they probably would have fixed the game mode by now (not balanced, just fixed)
---
How did it even pass a QA?
---
Haiku burger is a new fortune cookie.
---
I mean I don't think anyone forced them to do that job tho.
---
I suppose that makes sense, but the way this post is worded just sounds like complaining to complain. 
---
But I see the point now. I just skimmed a lot of this and it seemed like it was just complaining about the mere existence. (The comments’ implications don’t quite help either) 
---
But thanks for telling me. Have a good day. :3

Revenue from WvW mount skins &gt; Competative PvP mode

I've had this happen to me and I don't know the answer but it ceased for me for a while now. For me it wasn't a regular thing either, but something that occured randomly, mostly when I tried to shutdown the game.
---
To your problem with the taskmanager: Switch to taskmanager via alt+tab, type "GW" and hit alt+t and enter (don't use your mouse). It should be able to kill the process.
---
To a solution: Sadly, I don't know what could solve this. What comes to mind is driver updates mostly. Also you could try to turn the "Focus Assist" of Win10 off?
---
A couple of questions.
---
1. Is the blank screen black or white?
---
2. Are you using any auto login / login skips? (Launchbuddy, etc)
---
3. Are you using any overclock software? (Afterburner, etc)
---
Nice job.
---
you're stuck on 420 points, I feel like I shouldn't upvote you anymore

Also, your pun is excellent

You mean HK is fighting to stop this?

They aren't my favorite content but some people really enjoy it. I think it's worth having a couple more for the people who like it.
---
well playing an MMO sounds like your first mistake, bud!
---
Random FYI, the white screen problem that happens with invalid credentials and Launchbuddy, hasn’t been around since they killed the command line arguments for auto login.

We must live in different parts of the world since 10 hour shifts are straight up illegal here.
---
Tying Legendaries and Mounts to JPs just means that there's a portion of the community that will never be able to do either until they find or hire a friendly mesmer to port them past the puzzle.
---
There is no reason to tie something as essential as a mount behind a jump puzzle gate.
---
You have to remember that not everyone has the hardware or the ability to run JPs. For example, if your graphics are on low, you might be jumping at a place where there isn't anywhere for your hitbox to land, and you'll also have trouble you're stuck using a touchpad to play.
---
And that's not even approaching accessibility issues for people who have physical or mental disabilities to overcome.
---
I like them! Just don't make them timed/timing sensitive please. That stresses me out and can be painful for people with bad reflexes/internet connections.
---
I didn't even mention graphics, so I'm not sure why you did. 
---
Yoshida has said multiple times that pretty much every duty and UI limitation was due to the ps3 holding it back, not the amount of players.  
---
If ps3 support never dropped, pretty much every single new system introduced in each of the 2 expansions (Stormblood and Shadowbringers) would not have been possible
---
I was actually quite worried to open BLCs because with my luck I would have gotten that ugly outfit and I can't sell it lol
---
True, more puzzle like content would be fun too!
---
Seems like a cry for help
---
I've never been able to do the WvW jumping puzzles. I can't land on whatever it is I'm supposed to be able to land on because I can't see where I'm supposed to be going.
---
The one time I've been able to get into either, I had to hire a mesmer. I had spent over a year and at least 80 hours trying.
---
I don’t know either and maybe others don’t either since they responded with non-answers. :-) just wait around I guess, or look at the wiki entry for a map and look at the events List there. That’s my only idea.
---
Maor jawmping!!!!
---
I really enjoy that they're in the shared inventory slots as well.
---
I dunno man, I did skyscale in little less than a week and if it was that easy to get legendary armor then everyone would have it right now
---
I dont think it would be a priority, but I am not against it.
---
almost like the target of flame isnt the problem...
---
[deleted]
---
It would be nice as a skin. But it would be nice if it was a mount with gliding capabilities. Lore wise you could justify it as an Asura creation based off Maguuma gliding. Created as a small fighter like craft to accompany airships. Bad at long distance flight away from ley lines.

---
3 keys. Nothing in the first one and then pulled the raptor and starborn one after the other.
---
That's all my luck used up for the rest of my life.
---
If they are doable naturally. By that I mean I don't want jps that require to land perfectly on this one little jutted out piece of wall.
---
I find team comp matters a lot honestly and I try to swap classes to match team comp.
---
I currently play Scourge for the most part because of how incredibly strong it is, even more so on maps you can truly abuse it with a firebrand partner.
---
If we have a scourge and no firebrand, I swap to firebrand.
---
I find most people in solo que either play roamer or side point as their roles, so I just try to fill around them.
---
Whenever I lose, most of the time we either got outplayed, my roamers cant effectively or wont effectively do their jobs, or my sidepoint person cant handle a 1v1.
---
I suggest everyone take a deeper look at these roles and how they are meant to be played, because honestly most people fight too much or let themselves die on a point they could have never obtained anyway.
---
I am not saying that you do these things and it will be better, but I know it has certainly helped me, but solo que is solo que and when it wants to be ugly it can be.
---
Speaking about why I enjoy sPvP, I enjoy it under specific circumstances. Both teams have a decent meta team and its gonna come down to proper rotations, chaining CC, and focusing down the correct targets.
---
I think another thing people could do better is adjusting their utility skills to match the enemy team as best they can, but thats another discussion.
---
I didnt say balance around roaming, I said control overpowered roaming builds because it's not healthy when one class can oneshot a person every 10 seconds at max range with no drawbacks. Roaming is still more common than gvg whatsoever.
---
Whats the point of balancing around gvg when some builds that are played in gvg have almost no impact on other parts of wvw? If staff DD is the main offender in gvg, why would you nerf it if it's useless in blobs? If condi herald is very strong in gvg, why would you nerf it when it's completely useless in blobs? 
---
Blob fights and gvg fights have completely different metas so there's no point of balancing around both, especially not when gvg is so niche.
---
GvG has nothing to do with guilds running around maps though. Just because you raid as a guild, doesn't mean you're GvGing. GvG is organized 15v15 (usually) fight with no pugs, no siege, no objectives and no terrain advantages. What you're describing has nothing to do with GvG, it's just guild raids with random number of players on each side which is a lot closer to blobs than it is to GvG.
---
The Sylvari might disagree.  You could be eating a distant relative.
---
10 keys, which came in a bundle with jumpstart pack for my alt. 
---
At first I was super excited, then I realized it was an outfit and you can’t turn off the dumb looking head.
---
Well, actually... To play PvP, you have to be able to move and fight. You're using the same key settings and attacks you use in PvE. It's how you get around the game, and moving those skills to PvP is more a function of changing your gear and stats than learning a whole new skill set.
---
To run a jump puzzle, though, you have to know the spacing, you have to time your jumps within a small margin of error, you have to have the right race of character, and you have to move your camera around to make sure you can see what you're doing, and sometimes you have to do all of the above on a timer, otherwise things will be more difficult for you.
---
TIL ANET is neglecting WvW.
---
That was one example which you seem to be focussing on rather than acknowledging that the game as a whole has many areas that need addressing before new jumping puzzles should be added. I would say that you seem to be missing the point entirely.
---
I’ve been lingering in T2 fractals for a long time, and tier 1 when I want the challenge of running with completely inexperienced players :). 
---
I’m slow to learn mechanics (older fella) but I’m comfortable with all of them now in terms of the flow and mechanics of each.  How big a difficulty jump is T3?
---
Not exclusive to PvP I'm afraid.
---
3. But since I got it by the key-farm I didn't spend anything on it.
---
Smth being illegal doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't happen.
---
I live in germany and at some places they still make ppl to work 10 hour shifts.
---
It is better than the Mordrem Bloom event....but that is a VERY low bar. 5 champs for 1 box AND I have to go to a city to trade them in rather than double click the marks for a trade window?
---
&gt;Last time I played in gvg, condi was meta
---
means, it's been a while for you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; I play with my guild and the only difference between GvG and open field WvW is, we add additional teams to the squad and run the GvG meta with more people. 
---
I quote my last post to this. Idk how you are able to overread this. If you at least tried to read and understand, then you would have gotten, that big blob vs big blob isn't the most common encounter in open field WvW and thus I asked you, why should we ballance around it, instead of most common squad sizes in WvW?
---
\----------------
---
You also seem to constantly cry about DareDevil, but there's always only 1 in a team of 15 people. I know the DPS of it is strong and the utillity with the smoke field is great as well, but it's not broken OP.
---
Can I have one?
---
My friend just play this game today, f2p, lv 10ish, killed champ vic and no mark reward, so what is the min lv actually to join champ rush event? No info about this from wiki.
---
You gonna buy me some? I don't have funds to get them since payday isn't til Tuesday ;_;
---
&gt; you have to know the spacing, you have to time your jumps within a small margin of error, you have to have the right race of character, and you have to move your camera around to make sure you can see what you're doing, and sometimes you have to do all of the above on a timer
---
that's all just as important to performing well in PvP.
---
timing, precise execution, camera control... even model size has an impact on ease of targeting.
---
&gt; and sometimes you have to do all of the above on a timer
---
that's the case in *one* out of 60+ named puzzles
---
I think it would be neat if Bubbles were somewhere in the Unending Ocean, it could also server as ANet's path back into Cantha. Make Cantha under attack by Bubbles minions, and we have to come help or something.
---
There's a lot ANet could do
---
used about 25-30 trying to get the dragonfireworks backpiece and didn't get it. Guess I'll wait til it's available for Statuettes cause I don't want to chance getting that fugly outfit.
---
Challenge accepted
---
&gt;I didn't even mention graphics, so I'm not sure why you did.
---
Because Thierin said:
---
&gt;I think theres too many people running 10 year old computers playing GW2 for that to happen.
---
Which is mostly true. The new "systems" had nothing to do with their hardware being old or not. A person with a 10 year old computer could run "A Realm Reborn" and can run "Shadowbringers" just as fine.
---
&gt;Yoshida has said multiple times that pretty much every duty and UI limitation was due to the ps3 holding it back, not the amount of players.
---
These only had to do with scopes, such as expanded inventory like I mentioned.
---
&gt;If ps3 support never dropped, pretty much every single new system introduced in each of the 2 expansions (Stormblood and Shadowbringers) would not have been possible
---
Please, stop with this ridiculous narrative. You don't even play the game. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
It is more off-putting than anything else. Without genuine interest, you can easily see someone who doesn't want to be there and it takes away from your enjoyment as well.
---
There is a "sieran" one, but it's just an especially strong Risen that taunts you over her death
---
Once I sold my Ghostly Infusion for 2 copper through a bug (don't click the sell button too fast!). Don't give up! :D
---
Enjoy your meal!
---
What site is this from the first picture?
---
Afterburner causes it when I use any auto logins though.
---
I have to disable it.
---
I don't often talk about you outside of TacO discussions, so I'd say somewhere in the ballpark of seventeen? Me, I'll eat meat all day long.
---
...wait, no I didn't mean-
---
im so confused by this statement. i collect a lot of toys and figures, including hot toys, and 98% of them are manufactured in china with just a select few located in japan
---
They got it right, cute girls was the answer all along.
---
I hate it but this is probably true... It's intentionally left ambiguous to give writers room for character callbacks and any other shenanigans they want to add.
---
So long as a mesmer can port people, I would say it's fine.
---
*insert gif of literal toast clutching burgers and laughing maniacally*
---
Exactly, im fed up with having anxiety attacks when they balance their game, wondering if they suck the fun right out of another class i like while getting so few skins to play dressup AND having to wait a quarter of a year or longer for a little bit of story and a repetetive map that offers no value after a week or two. This announcement better be good else im gone...well more gone then im now since i focus on warframe, they atleast give me what i want. Fun gameplay, lots of fashion and not fearing for my darn frames/weapons at each update
---
&gt;There's also the fact that humans came to Tyria through the mists led by the Gods.
---
One correction: The Mists connect to other worlds/universes. The lore is that humans came to Tyria from another planet.
---
Revenant is fine, theme wise its pretty interesting class, and its pretty fun to play.
---
Balance had multiple shifts multiple times now, so, yes, a lot has changed there.
---
Being a healer is importnant mainly in Raids and Fractals, when it comes to PvE. Then ofc in WvW as you already mentioned. But without a healer, raid cannot be.
---
Story in expansions and Lws has improved quite drasticly over the core game, its still not perfect, but to people like me, who dont mind a bit simplier plots, its really enjoyable, and there are some more hitting moments too.
---
Dungeons dont have any support now, We have new version of them, Fractals, and Raids. Fractals are short dungeons with difficulty scaling, random disadvantages and advatages, stuff like that. Currently theres 20 different fractals, spread into 4 Tiers, from 0 to 100. To go into higher fractals, you need to get Agony Infusions on your ascended gear, otherwise you will be dying pretty much instantly. Fractals, opposed to dungeons, are quite a bit harder, and require actual group, but once you get hang of em, they are pretty easy.
---
Raids, are your "classic" mmo raids, 10 man group content, where you slay different kinds fo bosses, Im not gonna give too deep of an explanation on that now.
---
The "training" youre talking about is called Masteries, after reaching lvl80, you can start leveling your masteries, these are different abilities that you unlock by filing up xp bar, and then spending Mastery Points(which are acquired by achievments, story, and insights, which are something like hero challanges) on the mastery that you decided to train. Each expac, and associated living season, has their own mastery tree, along wise some for core game, fractals, and raids. Some examples of these masteries are bouncing on shrooms in maguuma, improving the skills of your mounts, gliding, etc etc. Some are simple, some more gameplay changing.
---
They have already all but killed WvW and PvP. PvE does not need balance. 
---
I say fuck it.
---
Is it not worth it even when using junk exos that dont normally give a good precursor?
---
The entire veggie burger market was, without a doubt, the greatest single purchase I will ever make.
---
Nope this is Advertising 100 sir
---
But you aren't killing Sieran in that one. You are killing a Risen that mocks you over letting her die.
---
Dropped a free key while playing.
---
Used it and got the outfit.
---
*sips from a giant mug labeled "your tears"*
---
New class is a mist-themed warrior with flashy skills and locked utilities. They change similar to how ele switches attunements on weapons but rev switch utility instead.
---
Balance shake up things every 3-4 months. Nuff said things are pretty good here with lots of versatility of ALL classes.
---
We have healers now, they are useful in raids and fractals (dungeons 2.0).
---
I don't play wvw so can't tell.
---
Story is amazing now, really. Also gives new maps and mounts and whatnot.
---
Lvl 80 is still your max, with exception that you can get extra specialisations changing your class a bit. Maxing out is quick but it don't make you stronger, it opens up new build possibilities. With proper team you max out hero elite classes in about 2h at lvl 80.
---
Dungeons remained as they are. But we have  better things to do. Fractals, are dungeons with 100 difficulty levels, challenges, require top gear. We get new ones regularly. Also we got raids for 10ppl squads that are much harder than anything you saw in game so far.
---
Just discover stuff, join a guild maybe. Game got a lot of QoL improvements. It's literally a different game than it was at release.
---
Game isnt empty
---
I want them to stop exclusively catering to casuals
---
This is actual content I actually like.  I started the game from release with one of my favorite activities being to solo every champion in the game.  Since then, I do it with every class and these days it's a part of my testing new builds.
---
I don't do it as often anymore because of power creep, but I still do sometimes for fun and testing builds.  I would have very much enjoyed this event IF I could have done it in an instance environment.  
---
I really dislike going to all my champion spots and finding them either empty or having a bunch of people join people.  I enjoy soloing them, not zerging them.  
---
I know most people can't stand the idea of having solo content in a MMO game (even though GW2 has a lot of that as does most MMOs).  But offering an instance version in addition to non-instanced would make both camps happy.  And instance versions could be done still in parties of 5 so people can have their "social" experience while still actually being able to find champions easily instead of waiting for them to spawn.
---
https://gw2timer.com/?mode=Mobile , I'm on my phone so it's different but it's from here on the desktop version

You mean wow or gw2?
---
Why are they "waifus"? Because they're females who are Asian? Get a grip dude...
---
Thx for the info.
---
Shoulda just gone for broke and put in a bid of 4c for Eternity...
---
Definitely.  Know a couple girls who did this in college and for extra money on weekends, they put up with a ton of shit.  Conferences and industry events were bad too; lots of rich managers who assumed they were for sale.
---
Not a job most could keep doing for long time... unless they were actually open to propositions.  ChinaJoy is famous for those kind of transactions, which in turn leads to lots of amateur cosplayers and booth babes who aren't into it being harassed as dudes assume most girls there are there for that reason, when it really isn't the case.
---
WoW actually gets real content added to the game :)
---
Its legal if you agree, but if you dont you might be risking your contract :p
---
I'm the same but I feel like alot of other don't feel the same , and hope you were working on the currencies  while doing the feeding :)
---
I kinda wanted to get lucky with it. I had about five or so Bl keys stashed from weekly run that I was saving, and got crap revival orb/tp to friend/usual bad drops when the outfit first came out. I had two keys saved recently on my alt, and I performed my rngesus ritual before opening them, and I got the starborn outfit and a glyph (I forget which one). It was crazy seeing 5slot twice in a row.  
---
I think you need to find your rngesus ritual.
---
I only accept garlic toast of the mad king.
---
[&amp;AgGiLwBAzIwAAA==]
---
you still sell it to the one with the highest bid and the gold difference will added for the bidder. But dreams can become true if you wish strong enugh for it.
---
Yah no problem it's pretty nice when you have it open on an alt monitor able to look at timers and everything you need.
---
Everything in WoW Classic is slow, leveling was slow-paced and often required grouping.  It was common for healers to pair with tanks, if you were a warrior main and your priest friend wasn't playing that day you went to cities or quest areas looking for LFGs just to level, if no one wanted to join you either had to go really slow or play something else.  You get your first mount at level 40 it was expensive, everything in vanilla was expensive until you got your gathering and crafting up and making you money.  PvP was unbalanced, racials were a bit too strong in vanilla.  Most common gankers were undead rogues.  Classic will also lack all the QoL features that people take for granted in modern WoW.  I played vanilla, I have some interest in Classic from a nostalgia standpoint, but IMO anyone jumping into Classic fresh with no nostalgia might wind up hating how clunky and dated it feels even compared to modern WoW.
---
i still havent.
---
Even if you did that, It would get sold to the highest bidder. He would get his additional coins back.
---
There is nothing more noble than the majestic veggie burger - not even charity.
---
Plot twist: It is all just recycled content. And Classic you can expect no new content added *ever*, with 99.9% chance, as it would ruin the authenticity...they even vouched to reintroduce old bugs.
---
&gt;Map completion is meant to be fun.
---
just like JPs
---
In 20 years people will still talk about wow, while nobody will remember gw2 or anet ever existed.
---
What I meant with FB is, I don't want to keep seeing the same boring situation that we are in ever since PoF came out. I am aware Scrapper is a better condi removal and Ele is better with healing, but I want both of them be equally required for supporting as Firebrand. *"Oh, you are playing Tempest? That's cool but... we already have one, and party 4 is missing a Firebrand..."*
---
And the engi changes were just an example. It would be cool if one of those preparations on Thief removed boons as good as Spellbreaker bubble does (then a thief could place Boon Remove prep + Seal Area prep to trap people in, and thiefes would be much more welcome in zergs).
---
Excuse me but I will have you know I was *very* enthusiastic about buying all these burgers
---
Yea, it's pretty much the nostalgia driving it.
---
I remember when OSRS first released, and people who didn't play from wayyyy back then (early 2000s ~ 2003s) touched it and gave very bad opinions about it.
---
If yu never tasted the slow paced for WoW back then, the Classic will have less of an effect for newer players.
---
Yeah, you can go honor or radiance. But you lose the vuln application on pw which is often worth 10-15% damage. I haven't noticed a big difference in damage between core and dh, but dh is much easier to survive on
---
The genocide was not caused due to charr though, but by the humans themselves. Stop trying to divert the guilt on us, we only wanted to reget our HUNTING lands.
---
Oh nice.  Maybe they'll even have a Corrupted Blood incident for the nostalgia.
---
Pretty sure the term would be cash *out* in this case, seeing as I no longer have any.
---
I've mained ele since 2007. When I'm playing alts to fully unlock professions or whatever it always amazing me at how survivable I am. The "faceroll any PvE content" meme is actually true for most classes. But, honestly, in open world PvE I actually prefer glass cannon styles of play because I have to pay attention. 
---
Now, in fractals, raids and WvW I don't play ele cuz I suck at videogames. For PvP dailies I do play ele but that's because I get to play a meme build that focuses on immobilizing enemies. I like to think that I'm doing a service to the world by teaching them how important stun breaks are &gt;:)
---
I went fresh into a private server recently to demo Classic and this is pretty accurate. Slow and way more emphasis on RPG elements. With that added emphasis on RPG elements, players are forced to group to round out their capabilities in combat, gear progression/crafting, and utility through unique class mechanics.
---
Personally, the gameplay and social interactions remind me of D&amp;D with a larger pool of people. Then, just like D&amp;D, the incredible atmosphere brings a level of verisimilitude I've never felt in GW2.
---
\+1? ahah
---
Vegan is unnatural.
---
Get in line mate, I’ve nodded 3 copper pieces for that.
---
Its more a weith in pve or other areas without a team.
---
I did a research internship at the beginning of this year and close to the end of it, i was asking my supervisor what kind of things he want in my final report. All he said was, that it should be 20 pages of sfw Taylor Swift fan-fiction :D
---
I actually started back in beta but quit... reconnected with an old... friend... who still plays, joined up again, was gonna buy the expansions but a few people told me to wait a month

Griffon isn't a story mode mount either (and I don't think roller beetle counts either, to be honest I completely forgot it), but proof isn't necessary. If I could send people to gulags there wouldn't be trials, and no genuine GW2 player would ever get sent there anyway.
---
I appreciate your hours, and especially the dedication you seem to have put into Tarir (AB is my all-around favourite thing). Carry on, and don't burn yourself out.
---
First box I opened. Didn't really want it tbh.
---
I'd just rather people not give Teapot any attention at all.
---
I tend to believe they weren't.
---
Your boyfriend might have been lucky, and 2 infusions out of possibly hundreds of thousands that have been opened already is nothing.
---
What did it for me was a guy that opened 100k boxes from the Four Winds Festival and got about 10 super rare drops (most of which were the ascended recipe). I just don't think it's worth it to grind for so many hours to get around 100 boxes knowing that on average you need to open 10,000 to get something actually valuable
---
Nice try
---
For Aurora you need to do LS3 JPs
---
I can only say: Guild Wars 2 is a very social game. Definitely look for and join a few guilds! Try to find one that fits you. The guilds are what keeps me coming back to GW2 every time.
---
Without a guild, the game feels very lonely. You can even find people to do stuff with that way!
---
started playing bdo this week and i gotta say, gw2 is static AF.  
---
connecting towns for trading between them, carriages, ships, hiring workers in the fields after investing, exploring the map, crafting, doing the rading work yourself with a carriage, horses did it first with skills (always thought gw2 was the first with nice mount skills, tourns out bdo has that way longer with its horses).  
---
then all the life skilling....fishing, cooking, crafting.  
---
like even when you are not interested in high end player pvp, you can enjoy a highly casual game with just the life skills.  
---
calling gw2 dynamic because some events are on a timer and they branch a bit out...yeah no. its not.
---
I'm all for them, provided they're less like the Chalice of Tears/Skip up the Volcano and more like Abaddon's Ascent. That said, I'm pretty sure I know why ANet didn't really have any in PoF or S4 - they would require large areas of a map to be no-mount/glider zones to avoid people being able to cheese them, which would not be conducive to easy use of the Griffin or Skyscale. There are ways around the problem of course, but they require devoting quite a bit more of the map's design to the JP, which isn't always practical.
---
Hey, gotta keep that one fresh so it doesn't sound overused on Halloween! 🎃
---
You Mad Queen Says thank you!
---
Yes, it would still work. Besides even if the mount's jump distance was even shorter he could just use Rocketboots. Or Mirage Sword1 leap. Or ranger, warrior, guardian etc leaps.
---
 The only thing that would fix this one (and many many other breaks) is to fix the bloody jump on dismount. Yes, I know they already fixed that, but as you can clearly see, they actually didn't.
---
I would have the power over all of creation in that moment
---
Do I sell them? Distribute them sparingly to only my most loyal disciples? Or do I end it all and just delete everything? I don't think I could handle that kind of responsibility.
---
I"m pretty sure it's too late for that as I'm already over 40, but I do save what I can :) and I have a 401k that forces me to save that way too.
---
For real tho...what or who the fuck is teapot?
---
I don't think those changes would make for any better wvw tbh.
---
FWIW, 8G RAM is kinda low if you have tabs or other programs open while running gw2.  Yes, swapping can happen but for performance reasons you'd never want it to happen. GW2 is 2.5 GB RAM just sitting in town.
---
Also, I think the black screen thing was a Win10 issue a little while back.
---
So basically vanilla wow had no qol? Gotcha
---
Someone should have name account Chicken Dinner. Battle Royale for gw2 confirmed then :D
---
How does this increase ANet's gem sales, cause that's all that matters?
---
I'm not touching it.
---
Why? Is our happiness toxic to you? WHY YOU HURT MY FEELINGS BRO!!
---
Even for you! PM me your IGN for burger haiku a.
---
If it's Ember Bay style and you need it for Map completion, it's not ok.
---
Also bdo is basically " crafting the mmo" 
---
Comparing that to gw2 is like comparing wow to gw2
---
yeah, having them be unusual or interestingly designed beyond just - here's a series of platforms, jump on them - would be really nice. add some spice to them.
---
yup
---
Absolutely.  Open world bosses work well because they are on a timer.  But champions not so much.  A fractal farm is a much better alternative to a champion farm.  It isolates the farmers, and allows them to find teammates of comparable 'hardcoreness'
---
Wholesome supervisor! :3
---
JPs are not my thing, but having to complete Chalice of Tears for Aurora was some of the most fun i had in game. It was awesome!
---
holoblitz all over again =/
---
This kind, hopefully:
---
[&amp;AgFEMABAuV8AAA==]
---
Eh i would rather see it not being possible to upgrade SM at all. Anyone holding SM tier 3 is just making the whole map totally stale and boring. It ruins the fun. And people sit on walls and siege and refuse to come out.
---
They also promised no grind, and then their sole plan for endgame equipment was to add 'ascended' everything to significantly increase grind.
---
You loste on making smc even harder. People already siege hug there forever to avoid fights and it's aanoying as fck. Some other suggestions should be fine but we can't make sieges even more powerful than what they are without proper counters to all of them. I know they are part of the game play but this is still a player fight mode where you use your skills with class. If we lose any more focus than that just make wvw a mini game independent of class like a power defense game where you build and only use your towers to attack.
---
As it is right now, I've seen groups of like 10 people hold keeps against huge huge zergs just because sieges + protection from castle makes it almost impossible to penetrate.
---
The one in Siren's landing is awesome. They totally learned what works and what doesn't with the previous ones.
---
I have 7y on dusk and dawn :D
---
Combat in WoW will feel slow and you will feel like you're wasting time watching at the slow animations to kill a stupid boar that 5 other people want to attack like you,just to drops that 5th boar hide you need for the questgiver just to be disappointed because its body is empty. You might want to gather some materials for your crafting, well probably somebody else took the node you wanted, now you have to sit there and camp it until it respawns or just move on. WoW dungeons are alright but, everything else is just slow compared to GW2.
---
Yes, definitely. They don't have to be major jumping puzzles even. Core Tyria maps can have 2-3 short puzzles with a variety of obstactles, and those are perfectly fine.
---
Yes to 1, no to 2 and 3.
---
If map completion is locked behind a bunch of time/skillgating it will frustrate those with not enough time or skill.
---
If optional things (legendaries, achievements) are behind time/skill gates it's fine (in my opinion)
---
Which is why I am fine with not getting every achievement each release. If I suck at Griffon flying or an adventure that's on me. It doesn't stop me from playing the game though.
---
I couldn't find anything on this in a couple minutes googling.  The closest I got was complaints that they were cooked on the same grill as the meat.  Can you help me out with a source?
---
I would suggest you read up on all the instabilities on the wiki, know your class and role inside and out, and check out video guides for all the fractals on discretize.eu. 
---
It may be hard at first, but over time you will get used to it and do fine.
---
SM needs inner walls that can be hit.
---
I don't really understand how any of this will revitalize WvW. The game-mode is bleeding players and whole WvW guilds because it's directionless and pointless. 
---
Every week, the more populated server will eventually win because they'll out-pip. And then what happens? The server in third place goes down a tier and that's basically it. I don't think players care about the pip output one bit considering the WvW rewards are the least rewarding. 
---
The fight-oriented guilds fought each other for years but without a proper tangible ladder system, it's ultimately a pointless endeavor to prove that your guild and members are better than the other guilds. Fewer guilds kept up with it and even fewer guilds that entered the WvW scene care for it. 
---
There's nothing wrong with the systemic design of WvW; the maps are fine with red bl being a little difficult to navigate, siege issues, and whatever else you said. It's the extrinsic features of WvW that need to be improved, or frankly, just established because right now, there is no investment for anyone to play WvW. None of the rewards are unique or interesting, there's no personal investment, no pride. What WvW desperately needs is the Alliance system but at this point, it's probably already too late because too many people, veterans and guilds, have already left.
---
Is it the one they patched from the outside but didn't change anything inside so you can still use the bunny?
---
I bought the sylvari one because salad race best race.
---
I got the raven and parrot ones for my humans because they're cheap on the TP yet nice.
---
I really like Mail Carriers as a concept. They're pretty, it's okay to not have them earnable in game, and it encourages me to send small thingies to newbies in the game just so that they can get surprised by a special mail carrier.
---
Honestly, I wish ANet continued making those - just the more realistic ones that would fit each race/fantasy archetype, not the really weird, flashy festival stuff.
---
Two things are true: 1. Keys are loot boxes and not worth the money. 2. I will probably buy some tonight.
---
Don't be like me. Or do, idc I'm not your dad.
---
30% off gambling is still gambling, kids.
---
The **only** way to revitalise the WvW population would be to eliminate the ridiculous levels of lag encountered in any three way blob fights. I have people on my server actively logging out during prime-time hours because the lag is bad - they want to fight, they just don't find it fun when skills lag for 5 seconds whilst being steamrolled by some 1200 range dude who can inexplicably use their skills.
---
That being said, in reply to your suggestions:
---
* SMC changes - breakable inner walls yes, everything else no. It shouldn't be siege central. There's a comment below suggesting upgrades shouldn't apply to SMC which I support.
---
* I'm not bothered by EotM not contributing pips, but maybe they could shrink it + make it into the third borderland. EotM is always dead + I would suspect the overflow maps aren't required anymore.
---
* Server/tier balance is absolutely trash. Even if they expedite the alliance system it won't fix anything whilst largescale bandwagon player transfers occur. It seems unlikely that they'll remove world transfers though. Shit balance is just something we'll have to live with I suspect.
---
* Increase points-per-kill versus holding objectives - support this, not sure about point count but ANet could experiment. Increasing points per stomp by a large margin might be good to encourage roaming.
---
* Pips - they're pretty fast without any changes.
---
* Open field mortars - no thanks, we don't need more siege.
---
* Warclaws were a nice idea but the stomp should be removed. Movement speed is sufficient reason to use them, the aoe stomp is OP.
---
It doesn't feel as good as I thought it would.
---
... actually, what I'm feeling might just be burger-induced constipation
---
Id be okay with it if season 5 was nothing BUT jumping puzzles :)
---
/s?
---
Taylor swift has been so quiet that shes now advertising in GW2 LUL
---
They may not be worth it, but that won’t stop me from going after the exclusives in them from map comp keys.
---
I was holding out to see if mail carriers got on the statuette rotation again.  But ended up buying the Sylvari one with gems from achievement rewards.
---
I like most of the carriers, sans the birthday one since its freaking huge.  My biggest gripe is the annoying ding at the end of most of the animations.  
---
I think they are nice to add to a characters theme, but there isn't a lot to choose from.  Also you probably won't see the animation a lot since you will probably have your inventory/trading post window open covering it up when you mail stuff.  
---
I will say we haven't seen a new mail carrier in a very long time though.
---
they are fitting race excep for sieran tho
---
Nice!
---
PS: At some point looked like you were struggling to get skyscale on top of the roof while mid air. You know you use skyscale's second ability to land, right?

I’m not sure how I feel about it honestly. I can’t say I’m having fun doing it but I do have a sense of satisfaction watching my account grow.

"Appearance depends on which event is triggered. Tybalt's event results in a charr, Forgal's event results in a norn, and Sieran's event results in a human."

probably intentional

Don't fool yourself. We'll all still be paying full price. Microtransactions and loot boxes in particular have never been about funding development.

COMEDY 100
---
The person you're responding to is a complete idiot, best case...or more likely is just trying to make the game look bad because they're not happy with it for some reason.
---
GW2 isn't without it's share of issues, but the community is still strong and it's still a good money-maker for ANet/NCSoft. Don't let this one moron influence your decision-making process.
---
50 keys: 2940 gems.
---
2940 Gems = 17 Bonds = 17 Gemstore items.
---
MHHHHHHHHHH
---
Oh? That’s extremely odd, there nothing LB does that should cause an interaction with afterburner. It even starts the game “as normal” by launching the client and sending key commands to start playing immediately. 
---
You’ve even seen this on the later versions that do swapping of local.dat pointers?
---
What's the CPU and internal storage of your laptop like? Is Gw2 stored on an SSD or an HDD? Wonder if it's worth limiting Gw2's disk activity or network activity...
---
It’s cool they are on sale but no way I’ll buy any. Unregulated gambling is not for me and I don’t see any value in those.
---
Did you forget about the Searing? That happened something like 20 years prior to the Foefire? That's the genocide he's referring to. 
---
The Foefire happened as a last resort, because the king was already broken by that point. 
---
I also have heavy doubts as to there being any actual evidence (besides dev confirmation) that the charr ever owned those lands. There are no records that would show it, so at best it was handed down via mouth and probably heavily distorted.
---
As long as there aren't any no-fly, no-glide, no-mounts, or invisible walls.

Nobody knows unless you try it yourself.

It takes all of 5 minutes to install.

So you recommend removing all current files and then putting this one in?
---
No gay characters on personal story as well. Good for them.
---
FIRST
---
Because. DeathlyHearts. Is. A. Generational. Talent.
---
He is literally equal (if not very slightly better) than Fennec, on raw talent. Him being competitive, even after all that he's gone through, and after all the time out of GW2, shouldn't surprise anyone. He's been keeping his ERP skills sharp; hell, he's been expanding them, even. He's done things in FFXIV which are frankly stunning, given his experience level, showing that his dps feel and intelligence are very much in tact. Those are by far the most important things in GW2. It's what separates the Fennecs, Rouls, and Deathlys from the Teapots, Brazils, and MMOINKSs of the world (with the latter being very good players, but lacking that extra something).
---
As for raw dps, whilst I'm aware of data which shows that Deathly is still very much on it, I accept that that isn't really an argument. The truth will out soon enough. But think of it this way: why would Deathly risk his golden reputation? He has zero interest in raids for the sake of raids. He isn't coming back to Spirit Vale for a joyride; he's coming back for records, wins, and maybe even Caudecus Manor P3. Snowify is merely stage one. I know I get laughed out of the park round here when I say that Deathly will be on LN's radar, and that I wouldn't at all be surprised to see him end his career on a high in the German guild, but I fully believe that'll be the case. That's why all this 'is he good enough for Dhuum CM' nonsense is so frustrating to me - fucking obviously, he is. The question is whether he can still show dps and mechanics worthy of the top 3 of the game, like he did in his previous stint in GW2.
---
There's no doubt in my mind that the waste of space opinions of all the armchair pesimists will be dust in the wind come August 24th 2019. Nobody will be in any doubt about what the name 'Black Eternity' means by then. And it will be the guilds who will come knocking to Deathly; not the other way round.

Great video, it's almost a history of GvG video, kinda. 
---
Also is it weird if i know all mentioned guilds?
---
For all the things everyone complains about these days, no one can deny that GW2 is flat out a gorgeous and atmospheric game. Exploring a new zone always feels so rewarding. And I still find myself going back to early game maps just to relax and enjoy the sights. I love just hanging out in a lot of the early Krytan and Ascalonian maps. 
---
I’ve been gone a few years and decided to catch up on LS4 and was floored by how deeply engrossed I got in it despite missing all the prior lead-up and having no idea who half the new characters even were. A testament to Anet’s creative team for sure, imo. Can’t wait for LS3 to go on sale so I can fall even harder in love with precious Aurene.

As a caster and an admin, I can't be seen to have bias.

Yeah osrs is kind of a pioner in this sector. It's true that a lot of is nostalgia. It's true the game will die if it's not updated. Osrs started huge then almost died. Then it started to get updates. Now osrs is bigger than ESO or GW2. It's even rumored to be almost as big as WoW. That's HUGE. All because an old nostalgic game started to get community voted updates. No gemstore. Yes it's a sub fee game but you can buy your sub with ingame gold which is pretty easy to get. It took my brother about a month maybe max 2 to afford the sub with in gamr gold in f2p. Once you're subed and do the members content. You'll start piling gold and effectivly never have to worry about paying a penny.
---
If classeic wow will start to get updated, better even if the community gets to vote weather they want those updates or not. Classic wow can easily be the god of MMOs. Don't be a blind fanboy hater. I never played wow, but millions of others have
---
There’s so much beautiful art in this game and the gw2 noui project has helped me appreciate it much more. I found Cursed Shore ugly and annoying as I was leveling the first time but subtle and beautiful as I made that vid.  I’ve come to think of these vids as love letters to anet’s art, sound, and music teams.

If you are in Baruch Bay, PM me and I’ll show you how it works.

Is there a guide somewhere about how to tweak and improve performance changing config settings? Like the multithreaded GPU you mention.
---
It comes iwth a level 80 boost with a ‘trial’ so you can feel how it works (though you can do that at PvP lobby without the level 80 boost). 
---
Many people suggest not to use the boost, but many people have been  happy using it.
---
Erotic roleplay is definition of trash talk in my opinion.
---
I think I will wait till 30 for the announcement reveal until I spend more money in this game
---
You are right.  But it has a magic that GW2 does not offer, I don’t know what it is, and at the end you get addicted to that game and lose your family and friends in real life :P
---
As everything is so slow, you talk a lot with the other people and you get lots of friends.

&gt;PvP in WoW is easy. Usually you get oneshotted by player with couple levels above you, or you oneshot player couple levels below you. balanced fight is usually pretty rare.  
---
&gt;  In battlegrounds, you can meet people up to 9 levels higher than you, thus they will just kill you very easily again. Or you level up to X9 level to be the stronger guy and cannot progress in leveling as long as you want to play pvp  
---
If you want to pvp while leveling it is best to go into battlegrounds when you're level is around the top of that bracket (19, 29, 39, etc.). Even if you are level X9 though, pvp isn't the best because **the game is balanced around max level play**. 90% of the content and reason to play is at max level. That's one reason they've made leveling easier and easier over the years is because Blizzard wants as many people as possible to be at max level so that they can experience the 'true' game.
---
There are PvE servers and there are PvP servers. You can only gank or be ganked out in the world on PvP servers. Then you have Alliance zones, Horde zones, and Contested zones. If you're Horde and in a Horde zone, for example, then you have to manually flag yourself for pvp by going into options or straight up attack an Alliance player that has wandered into your faction's zone. At higher levels most zones are contested,  meaning both factions are automatically flagged and can attack each other. Again though, this is *only* the case on PvP servers. If you don't want to have to worry about world pvp then you can always just play on a PvE server. If you're on a PvE server and feel like pvping out in the world, the option is still there to flag yourself for pvp manually. If you flag yourself then you can only fight other people who have also manually flagged themselves, no surprises.
---
Pretty much this.  Also, Blizzard has infinitely more communication with players than Anet
---
I always suggest my guildies to use a snowcrows build but use a self healing trait and/or a movility skill. 
---
With those small changes, they still deal a lot of DPS but are more ‘tanky’ with the same pure damage gear.
---
i love all the vanilla jp . always a pleasure to do them. anyway daredevil makes them much easier than vanilla professions
---
Gambling is a virus that has spread into games designed for kids and teens and is a habit that can be carried into adulthood. It's very dangerous. That's not a fair practice at all, and supporting a company by enabling that practice is a mistake in my opinion.
---
If that's the only way they can fund their game, then they are doing something wrong and don't deserve the money anyway...
---

---
WoW is old and boring. GW2 is one of the best modern MMOs with unique features (i.e. class design, mounts, ...)
---
Maybe shes a secret fan of the game. Playing it on her down time. She comes across as a Norn type of girl.
---
The mobs that condibomb you (like in istan) will just do it again after you cleanse, since their cooldown is much lower than yours.
---
They are also never in packs (if they have adds those are non vets and don't condi much if at all)
---
You are way better off just killing them in 1.5sec flat, and if you down to ticks just rally on a normal mob.
---
Lets use the "on downed" traits for example. Most (all?) classes have one of those; it improves your downstate damage or whatever.
---
If you pick that trait, you give up a trait that helps you fight stuff, so you are actually increasing your chance to go down.
---
This is "building to lose". You pick traits that help you when you already messed up and went down. Thing is, this stuff is easy to justify... 
---
Let's use a more "realistic" example: some dragonhunters use x-1-1 in the DH traitline. This gives you an auromatic stunbreak, a damage reduction when you have no condis and condicleanse on blocks.
---
This surely sounds amazing right? Problem is you are dropping 32% damage. That 32% damage is the difference between killing the mob with spear + any two skills (sword, symbol, whirl) and having to use 3 skills or add auto attacks.
---
At the end of the day you end up taking twice as many attacks. Clearly this is inferior in damage AND survivability.
---
Sitting for 7y on a contract...
---
Oh, I am not a hater...that was just as things actually look like now. I agree with the game needing to have updates, but if you read through WoWClassic fans, biggest voice is to not do any updates at all...and devs actually look like they will follow that. And ye, in my opinion that is not good way to do it longterm. Same as I believe that even games have evolution and just going against the flow of that evolution with no regards on what good was achieved since then, is no good move as well. Yes, some things went a bit sideways, but that is not a reason to discard all good things altogether.
---
So I am just waiting if such stances will persist even after the launch. My personal opinion is that not really a lot, but subscription will be paid already and that counts.
---
You don't have to wait on animations, only the global cooldown (1 second) in between abilities. If a spell has a 2 second cast time then of course you'll have to wait till the end of that cast or move to cancel it in order to cast something else. Combat in WoW is slower when you're still a lower level but later on and at max level the combat is not slow by any means.
---
Those are lootboxes and you shouldn't buy them.
---
Same thing happens to me too, especially when I'm using another app that's CPU intensive. Makes me worry I'll end up triggering a false positive with how far I appear to "teleport" when I use my mount's engage skill in that state.
---
(I wonder what that state looks like from Anet's perspective...)

&gt; tin foil hat moment, OP only posted this so he can momentarily drop the price of the spools while placing a load of buy orders at lower price. then waits for the cooldown and resell when the price go back up again.

Genuinely no. We got all the bases covered except for free-flying, and that won't be a thing. I'd also rather see something new, another Anet-branded innovation.

This is awesome! Good work =)

Skyscale is bae.
---
I did a core tyria completion for gift of exploration last week, and skyscale+jackal ruled supreme.
---
There were very few instances where gryphon and bettle were worth using (and trust me i tried). Truth is you do not need to cover great distances often (everything is close by and if not theres waypoints), and when you do need to cover ground, many times it's not flat enough for bettle or you do not have a high starting point for gryphon.
---
Agree with you on all except offensive mortars &amp; more siege.
---
If they were balanced to do low damage to people but more damage to siege &amp; walls they could work fine.
---
As for SMC it should just be removed and replaced at this point.
---
Maybe something like a wizards tower that is not as hard to take but gives all your other stuff a boost somehow ?
---
what gpu you use?
---
The only mount we still 'need' is an underwater mount and it is not required but would be a nice addition.
---
Everything else is covered. I'm sure ANet could come up with something else unique like the jackal but I'd rather not see anymore mounts at this point outside of an underwater one.
---
I don't think they've ripped up any outfits into armor pieces (too lazy to check), but they HAVE combined "armor" pieces into outfits. If you look up town clothing you can see which clothing sets were combined, and some others that were just chest/pants.

The skyscale makes it possible to do stuff that would require both the Springer (nice vertical hops but imprecise and hard to aim at times) and the Griffon (fast, decent horizontal movement, but loses a lot of altitude quickly unless you're an expert pilot) so much more easily. I've checked off a bunch of achievements on old maps recently that are basically playgrounds for the skyscale.
---
I'm one of the people that's basically ditched both of them, as you noted.  The slow movement speed is just not enough to outbalance the convenience the skyscale offers.
---
Then don't complain that there is no easy way to switch builds, because there is. You could just deactivate everything else and just use that feature alone.
---
&gt; there just needs to be more reason to come out once its built.
---
That goes against the entire point of what siege is.
---
Siege is literally to get in or defend structures without having to directly engage.
---
What you're saying is a dislike of siege, You don't like people siegeing, you prefer to fight - which is what I was saying.

Exactly.

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
More mounts = more skins to sell in the gem store.  So you better believe we'll have a couple of new mounts show up.  And then there'll be a mount power creep, where new mount abilities will outpace old mounts, making them useless.
---
Seriously fuck mounts. They're doing it so they can get more of your money for skins.
---
How about adding some instanced content? That would get me straight back in GW2. I've played since release (on and off) in 2012 and have returned for every expansion since but all they wanna do is give us a crappy non repeatable (I mean it is but why would you do that? Why would you do any of that?) Living World episode.
---
Soon as you've burned through all the new areas, you're straight back to Fractals.
---
As for PvP, never interested me at all so not really bothered if it dies.
---
The design of the statue is different in the US vs China, with the original version being less "posed" and more like Rytlock's actual design in-game. The Chinese statue is more humanoid and IMO kind of uncanny looking.

---
Once you get quaggan mail carrier, there is no need to buy more.
---
How do I use this and what’s the benefit
---
...so not at all the same thing.
---
Yes, you can go from armor to outfits. You can take something that was designed as six individual pieces that fit in specific boxes, and put them onto an outfit mesh. It's entirely different to take something that was designed without those very specific limitations of armor pieces, and turn them into armor pieces. 
---
This should be obvious, and I do not understand why so many people insist on being wrong about this.
---
If you ever want to go for legendary armor (PvE)/runes/sigils I’d say don’t toss them in the forge, because they are a really cheap option for Provisioner Tokens (needed for the said legendaries)
---
Yes, that's exactly why PvP and raids are dead, while open world grinds are thriving ...
---
Are you sure? Is it maybe the color of the weapon when you're not in WvW? I would think you have to be actively on a team in order for the game to register what color the weapon should be.
---
Is this another attention seeking post?  Who cares?  Just shows how dead this game is becoming, when people have to do attention whoring posts on reddit.
---
If anyone knows how I can edit this post to not be a \[Question\], please let me know.
---
It isn't that they are forbidden, is that they affect the rattings much greatly, and are more likely to slow down censorship. And if you don't get lucky and get an overzealous censor, they may make up some excuse if they don't like them.
---
So Chinese publishers self-censor the games they publish way beyond the requirements of the rating, just in case. 
---
https://www.techinasia.com/china-doesnt-censor-skeletons-the-truth-about-game-censorship-in-the-middle-kingdom
---
&gt; TL;DR:
---
So, while there’s no way to be totally sure what’s going on behind the scenes, can can draw some basic conclusions:
---
* Skeletons are not censored in all Chinese games, or considered taboo in Chinese culture.
---
* There is no public law that bans the use of skeletons, blood, or anything else like that in video games. But China’s laws about game censorship are broad and could be interpreted in a variety of ways.
---
* The censorship of skeletons in foreign games like WOW and Dota 2 was probably voluntary on the part of the games’ Chinese publishers, who were being extra careful to avoid any potential delays in the review process.
---
In other words, the next time you see a fleshy skeleton lumbering towards you in WOW, don’t blame Chinese culture, and don’t even blame the Chinese government. Instead, blame the game’s Chinese publishers, who put flesh back on the bones in the hopes of getting the game released more quickly in China.

&gt; War claw stomp should not be a one-shot. It should hit at most one downed player, in addition to its normal target cap (which should be raised to 5) and should deal 25-33% max hp to a downed player. In addition, striking a mounted enemy player with the dismount should pull them off too (but no more than one player)
---
Honestly yes. I mean there's what like... 2ish skills that can finish players outside of stomping. They're both elites and the shortest cooldown is 40 seconds on a single target. With warclaw you can finish 3 players as fast as you can get out of combat, get back, and maul them. (So basically about 15-20 seconds). It's honestly waaaaay overpowered for how accessible it is and basically means you're either revived in ~1/2 a second or you're mount stomped.
---
Lmao
---
Can't argue opinions!

50-80 alt accounts?? Like.. not characters but actual accounts?

I wish I actually cared.

How was that the bit that gave it away?? SC is home to one of the most notorious ERPers in the game :^)
---
well regardless of whether u like jps or not, ppl have to spend more time and take a closer look on the environment then they often do otherwise. Even if the maps are big, u can run through them pretty fast. In a lot of jps u have to search the way, so thats completely different. so it might be worth the recources.. developping huge areas isnt always worth much if there isnt something to do in it.
---
I do my inventory in exactly the same way.  I'm in the process of crafting 32 slot bags, so I will opt for the invisible variant to keep my stacks of unid gear in.  Normally I just ID and clear them all out at the end of a play session, but one my characters had about 150pcs of rare, and I accidently salvaged a bunch when I hit 'salvage all' on my mystic.
---
All of that is correct but still doesn't address why the devs don't do it.  I suspect because they don't really give a shit.  On my system no other MMO out there gives me the horrible FPS I had in GW2 and when researching it was because it is CPU bound and optimized for Intel not AMD.  Now move to a GPU bound (or Hybrid) system and my FPS would have shot up to where it is at in other MMORPGs.  Moving to a DX12 by the Devs would require more GPU, and less CPU, calls so my FPS would sit around the same as the other games.  Ironically the other MMORPGs I play since leaving GW2 (over this very issues) were the same age, or newer (one was even a few months older) but gave me raid ability FPS whereas in GW2 I had to make the game a blob (not in the other games) and still had 10-15fps.

A lot of the wiki does not show items worth deleting. I have a lot of story, collection items, and such that clog up bank space and inventory. Is there anywhere to confirm many of these items can just be deleted?
---
Just the preview. This gets added in to the game next Tuesday.
---
I have the Raven one, and I have no idea how or when I got it. I might consider the Quaggan one of it's cheap. But otherwise I ignore them.
---
They still missed some _big_ chunks. The four-elements puzzle in Mount Maelstrom, for instance, has a nice big no-mounts area... _around the chest itself_. Apparently the devs forgot that two of the four elemental cantors you need to open the chest are found on mini-JPs on the edges of the arena, because you can happily mount up to reach them.
---
Vanilla has the QoL features that existed for other MMOs at the time.  Blizzard doesn't really innovate, they're great at taking proven concepts and polishing them.  WoW exists because EQ exploded and people at Blizzard wanted to make that but with their Warcraft IP.  WoW didn't get a transmog system until other MMOs started implementing that feature, WoW didn't get separate crafting mat storage until other MMOs started implementing that feature, I could go on listing QoL or other features that didn't exist in WoW until other games did it first.
---
Vanilla was a good game for its time, but that will show for anyone not going into this with nostalgia for Vanilla.
---
Not surprising given the tongue-in-cheek name.

I like the concept, but I'm not too interested in most of the ones they've released so far. 
---
One I think I would personally like would be something where a Courier NPC from one of many spy-like organizations (Order of Whispers, Ash Legion, Shining Blade, random thieves that you might see when a thief uses Thieves Guild, etc) pops in and hands off/picks up a message then disappears. Basically similar to how the [Exalted Mail Carrier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzRkj8WKnXQ) works.
---
Stay strong
---
Please don't. Wait till 30th to decide.
---
Lol. Every material they mention/show in stream is instantly spiking on the TP
---
The lag in Wvw is nothing new, it's been considered almost a feature since the game's release, but "at least" it mostly happened only when three blobs fought each other, and the skills would eventually cast after a couple seconds. Needless to say that's not acceptable, especially when Anet sold this gamemode as part of the game, and they were the ones who decided we could have these threeway fights, and quite some people bought the game to play mostly WvW, just to be welcomed by what I just described.
---
However, lately it's been worse and worse. It lags like crazy even when only two blobs are fighting, and the experience is horrible, it's not enjoyable at all. It's obvious that Anet doesn't really care about WvW too much, they've proven that over all these years, but the fact that we can't even have a decent base experience in WvW anymore is... kinda pathetic if you ask me. I mean, we even get devs streaming WvW and saying they're lagging because they're playing in EU from NA (which obviously makes it a bit laggier for them, but we're playing from EU and the extreme lag is still there).
---
It's usually not as bad as it is on that video, but it's still pretty bad. That was just an example  of the stuff we have to deal with quite often.
---
I think it's about time we get some sort of love, isn't it? WvW has a lot of flaws, that's not a secret, but the least Anet could do is let us use our own skills and have decent fights, I'd say.
---

&gt; [Lesser Spinal Shivers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lesser_Spinal_Shivers): Number of boons corrupts decreased to 2 in WvW only. 
---
I'm pretty sure the engine does not support these kind of changes. So yeah your balance suggestions are debunked.
---
This is indeed fine.  It’s how these sales always work. 
---
This is particularly great for people who buy gold with their CC.
---
If you wanted to buy things in these sales you were better off pre-buying gems with gold.  That’s how it always goes.
---
List of mats so far please?
---
Remember when you could get 400 gems for 60g? Pepperidge farm remembers
---
I'd enjoy an underwater mount that can torpedo in and out of the water and dive at high speeds. However, gameplay wise it'll hardly ever be necessary and we already have swim speed infusions. 
---
Apart from that, I don't see any niche that isn't already filled. I am not a fan of mounts with a multi-seat feature. I imagine it'll quickly look super wonky and way too big, so I don't think GW2 ever needs it.
---
Stealth was barely utilized in any 30+ man group. The biggest use of F5 in large scale fights was removing aegis. The only thing that was gutted were GvG comps who no longer have to run 3 scrappers, but can bring extra tempest or two.
---
Stealth detection tactics also exist.
---
the tldr is at the top ez
---
It all depends of your unused ram amount when you run gw2. You have 2-8gigs unused ? This addon can eat a big part of it to buff your fps. But it will surely make your in game experience worse if you don't have some ram unused.
---
Looks like this is a mesmer from the great legendary choices and food. 
---
Putting shared inventor on the bottom is a sin. What do you do when you get inventory 120+? You would need to SCROLL down to your most used items. would you change your set up if you get a second 32 slot bag?
---
AFTER SEEING HOW THE SO CALLED ERP PRACTICE WENT FOR MULTIPLE GUILDS I'D SAY IT WILL BE A MIRACLE IF ANY CM WING RUN ENDS BEFORE THE TIME LIMIT IS REACHED.
---
Putting useful services into home instance would hurt their wallet, due to lost value of vip passes
---
More time gated recipes from LW S2 content.  Because that was so well received by the community during the Skyscale collection?
---
For the record I have plenty of mats to make several of them and make some serious gold - doesn't make it less stupid.

People who feel disillusioned with a company, or like their game is dying (very oft repeated in WvW especially) are more likely to spend money on cosmetic things.

12 hour shifts 2/2 nets you shorter average work week and is actually better for megalopolis lifestyle (hello 1h+ transfer times) while you are relatively young. And overall people actually prefer that schedule over sliding day/night 5/2 on line positions (thank to ever consuming everything Marriott).

They laid off the JP maker master.
---
Yeah when we consider how constrained the WvW development resources are we have to hope that Anet focuses on Big Bang improvements. Alliances come to mind.
---
yes because gw2 has sooooo many unterwater areas ...
---
You're seriously a legend for this.
---
&gt; casual content
---
Hahaha, maybe for some people. I hate platforming, so my main impression of them is frustration (except for Drydock Scratch and Deridre's Garden). I only do JPs for the achievements :/ If there were no achis tied to them, I would just ignore them altogether.
---
+20% Gold find lol
---
If they made it 200% gold find, would we even notice?
---
GPUs often have multi cores too.
---
Always happens.
---
So......this means you have access to you bank tabs within your home instance?
---
That would be insane!
---
Yep, I love them too, but some of them can get a little too long without continue points. Like the one they added with the lions arch redesign. It may be a joke now with mounts, but without a mount that thing can take hours to do without a couple of mesmers to portal you back up when you fall off the roof near the end a few times.
---
It was great fun to do once but just took far to long to get back to where you were to retry after falling and made it impractical for repeat runs. Sad part is with the 4 chests they could have easily designed it to let you get right back into the puzzle from the ground after each chest to make a checkpoint system. Just let players do each chest one at a time to not have to rerun the whole thing every time they fell.
---
Now days with mounts it only takes a minute or 2 to complete, but it is still a good example of how a simple design change could have made the jumping puzzle far more fun and accessible to the less hard core jumping crowd.
---
it only lasts for one hour
---
Tell the Necro in your team to quit slackin' then.
---
So?
---
That is the wrong question to make.
---
The right question to make is "what other mounts we could possibly have after skyscale?"
---
For example: 
---
* A mount with extra saddles that can carry other players.
---
* A sticky mount that can walk on walls and ceilings set with with specific surfaces like rough rocks, webs and vines, and reach places not even the skyscale can reach.
---
* A speed diving mount. Even if the skimmer got a new mastery to dive down, this one would be faster, kind of like an underwater rollerbeetle or griffon, much faster, but sharp turns at high speeds are harder. 
---
* An underground digging mount that can move up and down between layers, meant to be used in underground cave maps like those in the Depths of Tyria by digging at certain spots.
---
On the other hand, more people might purchase the Home Portal Stone if home instances become more useful.
---
I just use three shared inventory slots for unid gear, rather than having dedicated invisible bags.
---
Anet profits on time gates that you can skip with gold
---
The reason why it's gotten worse is the corrupts and effects like shades, legendaries and infusions. The server has to send all the information after receiving it, which makes it so easy.
---
Poor woman in the beginning has that "idk wtf I'm holding, but I was told to smile nicely" face on 😅
---
6 days and 20 hours until Judgement day.
---
that screenshot contains zero information we didn't have already.
---
Vip pass &gt; portal stone, and some people buymultiple vip passes, while you need a single portal stone
---
"GPU write" is a part of d912pxy that compresses and sends draw call data to GPU. 
---
Multithreaded implementation of it was a limiting factor for multithreaded replay, now it works just fine.
---
Anet solution's, let wvw dies, less players, less lag o7
---
The snow.....
---
first off, we're getting new links next week, so i would wait until at least then.
---
second, server "quality" is not only very subjective, but also fluctuating a lot lately (result of 7 years of neglect). if you do not enjoy the experience on piken, chances aren't low that you won't enjoy it elsewhere at this point.
---
actual wvw guilds? u mean pve guilds
---
&gt;all that unfortunately doesn't change that most if not all 24h crafting cooldowns are archaic and just an annoyance at this point. that involves ascended materials, charged quartz, and weird ass one-time crafts.
---
But the fact is there IS a profit for most of the timegated ascended mats. And updates like Skyscale added a huge profit for Charged Quartz at the time because you could sell Glow Lamps for massive profit.
---
I've been using this for ~2 weeks now and I think it's a great tool for exactly the same reason. Well done!
---
Yeah, leave the mounts for us, who hate JPs :D
---
My money is on [Clay Pots](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Clay_Pot) being used as well for building your oven, so better start to craft those as well and farm geodes for it.
---
meanwhile 6 celestial insignias, aka the requirement for an entire armor set, take 30 days worth of charged quartz 👌
---
It's been quite some time since the last time gem-gold conversion went to 170.
---
I'm basically looking for a good community, since my old friends and guild transferred elsewhere - it just kind of fell apart. 
---
That's why I'm looking to start anew, piken is currently not offering what I'm looking for. :)
---
Ah yes, the Friday Night Skill Lag. Good Times
---
And here i am, a Necro main, not even attempted a raid once. 
---
Curse you social anxiety!
---
Lol cooking :')
---
The new Thief portals are almost better than Mesmer portals for this now.  Not only does thief (via daredevil) have access to an on demand ground targetted jump but it has a super long range on its portal and nice short cooldown, and starts recharging the moment you cast the first set point.
---
And the guy walking through your home instance with a box and the upgrading of your oven is nice wee touches as well.
---
I mean, they made them entirely optional for the skyscale collection.  It just involved crafting or buying a food item instead.  Not to mention the mount itself is optional.
---
It sounds like he thinks "funding the expansion" means an hypothetical future expansion funded by this will be free when released, when it just means "there's enough money to pay the bills during development after the corporate overlords take most of it".
---
Currently all 3 Skyscale Hatchling Gathering Tools are available for purchase.
---
Are they worth the gems? I was considering waiting for the Volatile Magic Gathering Tools but now I'm not sure which one is better.
---
So the cooking changes will be as irrelevant as I expect it to be
---
I might suggest finding a guild to run with and transferring for them. Each server has strengths and weaknesses, and where you are in terms of tiers changes depending on the links. You can also take a look at timezones if you go to wvwstats, find a server that has activity during the timezone you play.
---
Google needs to step up their game.
---
Well.
---
Now ANet has to make this into a mini whether they like it or not.
---
&gt; after the corporate overlords take most of it
---
And, out of curiosity, what would be entirely reasonable if ^ didn't happen?
---
What are all these shit guilds? Where are the greats like DnT, rT, and of course the best guild TTS.
---
I know it's not easy for you scrubs to get the best with such meager rewards but where are Dontain, AuroraPeachy, Nemesis, Brazil, Strife, Jil Adren, eggpie and lordkrall?
---
How can you even consider this a tournament without the greats? Disappointing.
---
Ascended planks and ingots for food related crafting?
---
They're not all dead and it has been a problem. I wasn't getting it too too much but it was unplayable for some folks in my squad, in some cases it was close to /ten seconds/ of lag.
---
Because it was overpowered. I'm not sure if they've ever disabled a trait or skill (that was working as intended) for balance reasons before, so it was seriously out of line.
---
Yes! This is how she saves money
---
Okay kids, who wants Manning Coleslaw, and/or an explanation of why that's funny?
---
No, it hasn't been this consistently bad for folks in a while, a lot of long-term players were surprised that it has some back.
---
I was amused how trivial finishing up all of the Labyrinthine Cliffs collections were with it.  That map is utterly trivialized by skyscale, and I'm OK with that. :)
---
No, that's not what's made it worse. Everyone had the same stuff a month ago and it wasn't this bad, it hadn't been for a while.
---
I dont know how committed you are to healbrand, but you should really consider going quickbrand instead if you havent. The meta used to be dru/chr, which provided all the buffs to a team, but both dru and chr would put out very negligible DPS--albeit chr putting out more. The current meta is rene/fb, this is due largely in part because the DPS output of this combo is higher than dru/rene. However, having pugged a few times outside of a static, Ive noticed that many groups go healbrand/dpsgade rather than healgade/dpsbrand.
---
This is kind of confusing to me as the latter is much higher group DPS with the same buff output--healing is fairly similar, though in general, any healing often works well in fractals (many CM groups dont even run healers anymore). healbrand does very little dps, but dps renegade is also not super high DPS if it has to provide good ala uptime. To the contrary, quickbrand (especially condi after the patch...and yes, even in fractals) does a ton of DPS, which when paired with heal rene DPS, which isnt all too much lower than alagade, ends up being way way more DPS overall.
---
So, in general, if youre not committed to healbrand and just want to play any type of fb in fractals, consider quickbrand instead (condi is probably better atm, but power works fine too).
---
Literally a free game
---
Trident 5 on rev hits hellaciously hard on power builds despite being a condi weapon.  Enough so that it's really genuinely worthwhile swapping to trident just to use it once and swap back.  Rapid Assault on spear (spear 2) hits similarly hard and is on a very short cooldown, and cleaves.
---
Are you saying that every single player is at fault here rather than maybe just a bad server?
---
sT = qT + SC+ eS Leftovers
---
Stop zerging so hard you virgins
---
Nah, we've lost any trust in Anet.
---
It's worse since it happens with less players.
---
Meanwhile I've been playing swtor with floating cars that jump in place, take full fall damage, and go like 3mph.
---
If we actually got some new ones I would buy them. Not a fan of any of the carries we currently have. Still got all of them but they came from account wardrobe unlocks and such.
---
No. It was a neat idea but I'd never waste my money on one.
---
If it is just for the bank people can already get the same thing for free from WvW and PvP
---

Wait, are you not suppose to run MMORPG servers on potatoes and prayers?
---
Try it and find out? It literally a less than five minute process.
---
Honestly with that response they could work at Anet.
---
DX12 is Win10 only, period. You want it, upgrade.
---
veteran player wouldnt advise you to play healbrand. if you really need to play a healer in your fractals then go for heal renegade, it's the better choice
---
I for one, love the class diversity in WvW. :)
---
me any my friend made nice 5 gold per tho, running it for memes and giggles :D
---
SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN REDDIT GOLD
---
Yes, saying excessive effects cause server side lag is wrong. The only additional info passed by the server is "btw this character model has this effect". They definitely cause client lag though.
---
whoops it took 4 days pre-nerf nvm i have brain damage
---
almost two weeks, though!
---
Remember 600 gems for 1gold?
---
As someone who just purchased a 3900x, thank you.
---
Not necessarily, but hopefuly.
---
Now I need a storyline for every crafting profession.
---
I would love to see them come back. The feeling of stumbling onto a puzzle is something I sorely miss.
---
Yeah I was kind of joking, but it's somewhat true as well.  There's definitely some new things that I never saw before the most recent uptick in lag.  Condi/boon duratiions not showing at all (you can see this in the video), weapon swap not working, hell I even had a case where my endurance bar got stuck for a good 10+ seconds and I wasn't gaining any energy to dodge.  Luckily I survived because nobody else could cast any skills either lol.  It's pretty fucked atm.
---
Its funny how he tries to cast his healing skill and even thought he never casted it, it got interupted.
---
Aren't they Amazon servers?
---
Dont sound bad.  But for a 2 hour food :/. That move is only to not give more than the flask of metabolics.
---
I remember they disabled the healglyph from ele in all modes once.
---
qT is horny to drawn girls
---
i prefer my invis bags on top for quick access to the stuff i need while keeping inventory window at manageable size
---
Honestly keep in mind that unless your group sucks much of the healing you do will be overhealing.
---
In such cases Empowering might is actually better then pure of heart trait wise as it allows you along with other sources to easily keep might topped off.
---
Also if you have someone else in the group that can do fury it's advisable to keep a mace handy.
---
The sheer healing output of the mace is amazing.
---
I assume we have to do this for every race for all the foods?
---
Depends entirely on the encounter.
---
Heal renegade does allot more burst healing but doesn't do protection or AEGIS.
---
And given most encounters have lots of power damage I and many others prefer FB healer.
---
Just to understand it a little better, what does the replay feature do exactly?

30th anouncement: 'bankrupt, server down soon, seeya losers'
---
Hey it only took them 6 years to fix a big bug with Barrage, so who knows!
---
My lil quaggan guy gets an excited comment every time I send mail. Totally worth it
---
But sir... this thread is about skill lag... which has zero relevance to what you're talking about...
---
A big part that sold me on buying the game was "advanced underwater combat" without actually knowing how annoying it would be. As far as I know right now, they have 0 plans of making a legendary aqua breather which proves to me there will be no underwater mount bur I would absolutely love a big underwater revamp. Making the underwater frac different is a step in the right direction but it's not quite there in my opinion. I like the idea of it being more group based but it is still tedious.
---
They fired one of the two hamsters keeping the servers alive
---
Squirrels considering the game mode tbh.  It's the perfect plan!
---
maybe i need to start running it again too since i just spent another 7k gold on cooking materials after the dev stream preview today
---
You'll also need Deldrimor Steel Ingots and Spiritwood Planks. My guess is around 25-50 of each. So, better start crafting now for a cool profit, or buy to flip.
---

[yes, it was](https://i.imgur.com/W8W5hWr.png)
---
Not funny or cute.
---
Perhaps not the best time to bring up this argument since we are just complaining about lag then?
---
Understood, thanks! Is the maximum number still 4, after today's update?
---
My point was that it being charr lands in the first place was entirely retconned, and there are no charr records that would prove it in game. From a lore perspective they'd have no true way of knowing that it was their land other than passed down stories which you can guarantee got distorted over the course of 1000 years. The citadel is a blight on the land anyhow and should be purged.
---
i think a mesmer with a longbow could be interesting. Or a necro with a longbow. Basically any class that has no longbow yet. Hammer could be interesting too.
---
Lol vomit :')
---
keking 500
---
I'll take anything at this point.
---
But mainly:
---
- Sword/Sword Necro, mobile power dps, or Hammer with minion rework+elite spec focus.
---
- Hammer Ranger, quickness/alacrity + boons bot. 
---
- Dagger Mesmer, something that does away with the reliance on clones.
---
- Greatsword for Thief and Rev.
---
- Warhorn for heal Guardian.
---
They could be ec2 instances, but the servers are only as good as the ones anet buys. Plus if the actual netcode and software that runs the game is bad, aws's beefy servers won't save gw2
---
EU IN SHAMBLES, NA HAS A CHANCE.
---
Right? Only people who outright oppose them are especially spiteful people.
---
Jumping Puzzles are entirely optional and fun to do when you're just bored and want something casual to solve. And if you just want the achievement related, there's usually a Mesmer stopping by once a day. (Thieves can port now too)
---
"Hai, my name is Jack and I am an ex mesmer main."
---
"Crowd: Hello Jack!"
---
Alright, for mesmer it would be something like scourge/sb mechanic wise but all about power dps. You losing your illusions and place effects on the ground instead. Or maybe mesmer getting attunements like elementalist, such as Ether/Nightmare/Cosmos etc..
---
For my now main - engineer.. actually hard to say. Iron Man elite spec? Alchemist - support/condi damage spec? Something insane?
---
Ranger with a either a scepter or shield.
---
Warrior with a staff or short bow
---
Necromancer with a longbow or short bow 
---
Elementalist with a bow 
---
Mesmer with main hand pistol, longbow or short bow 
---
Better yet a new weapon entirely that no profession has.
---
Plague Doctor - Necro with pistol
---
Alternatively, a viable hammer specialization
---
I haven't played GW2 in about 9 months, but I remember it being the same way on T1/2 NA 9 months ago.  IIRC, it was worse during primetime when the most players were on the game (not just WvW, but all game modes).  But if you play another game mode with a lot of players, like a pve boss raid, then it was nothing like the wvw lag.
---
I have played this game since beta/launch.  It was never this bad.  It started getting worse around PoF's launch.  And as you said, there were occasional issues, even at launch, but those issues weren't seen by everyone - and now everyone has the same issue.
---
Yeah I cant even get near a zerg anymore without shit hitting the fan. It has been absolutely terrible for me.
---
still 4
---
i'm sure you worked hard on this, but looks is sub par their are tons of way better in game cosplays that don't post in reddit.
---
The main point is that the more defenses you give to a castle, more chances for players to dodge fights and siege hug. They already do that to the point that the zerg just gives up cause they gotta keep making trips to restock supply with difficulty to stay alive and reach enemy's defenses at same time completely unable to fight back in any way. I know defense needs an advantage but currently the advantage is too much and that is due to the power of sieges combined to castle walls being extremely durable.
---
By the by. The main complaint about the Skyscale was the fact that you had to wait for the next daily reset between each and every story step, not that it was difficult. You're playing *after* it's been patched to only be a 2 hour wait between each step.
---
WHATS YOUR FAVORITE QUAGGAN?
---
which is still a garbage argument as to why one legend is better than another since we have Mallyx and Shiro both of whom were villains; and Ventari + Jalis as "Good Guys"
---
Glint is a manipulative former dragon minion so I'm not sure where to rank her.
---
Revenant, Scepter, Master Togo and spirits as utility skills.
---
My few dream specs:
---
- Hammer Ranger tank - based on Wardens from GW: Factions;
---
- Scepter/Focus Rev - spirit summons, bundle F-skills, Master Togo legend, strictly based on Ritualist from GW: Factions;
---
- Axe/Axe Thief support/heal- Canthan;
---
- Warhorn Thief support - based on Separatist Stormcallers from Ascalon;
---
- Ranged Sword Necro dps - inspired by Frost Death Knight from WoW;
---
- Melee/ranged Mace Ele - totem summons, inspired by Shaman from WoW (weapon's range varied based on attunement);
---
- Rifle Guardian - rifle similar to the Ghostbore Musket from early charr personal story (super fun skills tbh, would make for a great weapon with lower cooldowns).
---
Not a single one. Outfits are tacky as hell, especially this one with how over hyped it is. Why spend that much gold/gems just to look exactly like everyone else. The whole idea of GW2 surviving solely on whales buying a shit of gems for shiny outfits, turns me off completely from the game. 
---
I even got the outfit from a key I got from personal story I just rolled my eyes because I know I’ll never use it.
---
We have several kids and a baby. Guild wars 1 is great and all. But its aged. She's enjoying what little time she has on guild wars 2. I wanted to fill her in on the story so she enjoys and understands the references, so the story is more enjoyable to her. Guild wars 2 ain't a bad game. Sure its got its  faults but its still a great game.
---
Of course I am. But a monster with taste.
---
Taylor Swift doing better advertising than ANet.
---
Yup my 32 slot bag collects bags of loot automatically so when I get gear i get junk on top and a layer of chests and bags to open on my alt. It makes cleaning up the inventory very easy after fractals or open world content.
---
Pardon my ignorance but... what is [PINK]?
---
Nice, I like your setup as well. Very intuitive and clean :)
---
Literally any light armor class with a bow - it's one of the few armor weight/weapon combos we don't have yet.
---
I think an Elementalist with a bow could be neat, giving them differently imbued elemental arrows.
---
LMK if you do EG; got a lot of information that isn't public yet
---
Exactly my thoughts, I hate to invest the little time I have in things which make me feel totally disconnected, isolated and frankly unfun. I feel literally upset and wasting potential money.
---
 I get a lot of people might enjoy that content, but I'm doing my best to actually enjoy the time I decide to spend in ANY hobby.
---
You have the shared inventory slots at the bottom.
---
YOU MONSTER.
---
Can you prime these foods with a 12 hr booster?
---
Mesmer daggers would be cool and fit well thematically imo
---
LOLOL
---
You sound like the type of guy in tech support that asks you to check if your cable is plugged in when experiencing connection issues.
---
The lag NEVER used to be that bad and we had intense team fights back in the day
---
same! i used to play a LOT but my free time has dwindled with age lol. doing unfun things that are “necessary” for certain achievements or items or whatever just feels like a grind.
---
Yep, hopefully they get it sorted out soon!
---
The lack of 🔥 in this thread is more proof that GW2 is dead
---
How would greatsword suit thief? Like Kensei? My only problem is that greatswords in gw2 are bulky so wouldnt fit that well
---
who or what are wardens?
---
bugged in that the first community reward hasnt triggered even tho we passed it already?
---
Glad i quit Wvw
---
love how the mounts are different among each other. good luck for those who are going back to wow classic.
---
btw gripphon is cool but since i got skyscale tangled is wonderful. really
---
There's core necro builds there as well though, in each game mode section.
---
82. Never again.
---
While I agree with you, that fact that they are not doing anything with performance problems (EU PC server lags) and nerf machine is what makes me angry. I just made  comparison. There are tons of topic on official eso forum with asking for nerf /\*paste here class which killed you in pvp\*/. 4 weeks in GW2 in high population server at night, prime time, day, morning. Enough people, I saw 3 ball groups in one place, NO LAG.
---
What I can say more? EU PC prime time eso is like slow slide show. These are just facts, so I still think GW2 better. 
---
Also kust one thing - world bosses. Did you tried it in GW2? Because if you played eso you know how trash they are, I can solo any world boss (ok maybe 1-2 is hard but rest ez).
---
JPs are not what i would call repeatable content lmao. yes you *can* repeat them but it's not rewarding.
---
collections are what i think of when i think of one good way to get players to explore the map.
---
and you know this wont even get a developer response before they make a cutesy comment on some fluff post
---
Correct. the community bar isn't moving up. ANet have acknowledged this and just gone "Yeah, as long as you did something you'll get all 5 tiers when the event ends, byeee"
---
They should have had him show up once you crafted to 420. 😒
---
I find it really stupid toom when people play this game like it's a job or something. Other than that, op has some good points about the problems with the underwater fractal and combat.
---
weird, never had any lag problems in WvW
---
Enjoyed the video. Looking forward to more home instance upgrades!
---
While we're at it. Can we get a 3rd Garden Plot? There's room and I'd love to finish them off (especially with cooking coming in hot).
---
Spotted the deadeye
---
accidentally fries his hand, eats it.
---
Unfortunately it also happens in big PvE bosses, Frozen Maw during the world boss event was a great example of it.
---
that's been pretty much their strategy since year 2 hasn't it?
---
In terms of glyphs Volatile is better (can use it to get [shipments](https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html) on top of season 4 things). Skyscale has it's own visuals but that's subjective if you like/want them. The Skyskale glyphs are [Reaping](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Reaping), [Alchemy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Alchemy), and [Crucible](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_the_Crucible). 
---
* Reaping harvests from nearby nodes (so it has the potential to save time especially with WvW or Guild nodes)
---
* Alchemy upgrades gathering results (would have to specifically mine nodes and remove the glyph for others to maximize profit, check the wiki page for details) 
---
* Crucible downgrades gathering results (same deal as alchemy, can be pretty easy to use on widespread nodes like mithril since it turns into more profitable platinum but is risky to use, again see wiki page).
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Warden
---
Yeah, weren't there actual posts by Anet devs saying that nobody still working there fully understands the "magic under the hood"? Could be spaghetti involved.
---
Remember 5000 gems for 20 silver?
---
THE CUTEST TYPE, CASUALOO
---
Till this day remains true
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezVy-zLUq6g.
---
Actually it's even worse than the past we reached new heights.
---
I'M ONLY HERE TO DRINK THEM CASUALS' TEARS.
---
Whaaaaaat how did you figure that out??!?!???
---
this thread is so fuckin good
---
yep, if i play power fb i use tome skills regardless. it's actually the easiest way to see if your qfb is good - a good one tries to squeeze in some tome support when there's a phase etc.
---
for example after 1st mama phase you can quickly drop a reflect dome on the champ (or whatever champ you prefer). you get the feeling for every encounter how to minmax.
---
after enso cap phase - heal tome 5+4 to give ppl scholar back. i usually play dps and look for power fb and people don't do stuff like this, sadly
---
Or is it too do with ascended coming...?
---
Gourdon the roasted Choya :)
---
Think of it as donating towards the game and getting a random reward as a thank you.
---
I didn’t want to say it but since we’re talking about it. I thought it was Action Role Play where they focus more on the um... action part.
---
When I msged anet about rubberbanding they told me it's on my end and it's my router's fault. So I wasted time trying to fix something that I can't fix. Noice.
---
"..time to wake up, Anet"
---
Hands down, best joke of 2019
---
It's not that veterans don't like WvW. It's that veterans that liked WvW have quit.
---
why did you put up a video of the northern lights? oh wait...
---
Bring a healer with a lot of condi cleanse. Not sure about others but Heal Scourge is pretty damn good at cleansing condis and works just fine underwater.
---
meanwhile on EU Tier 5:
---
Champion Oakheart starts to think about buying a commander tag to get the attention of 1 or 2 players left on EBG to end his own existence so the pain goes away until he respawns again.
---
There was one week without skillag.
---
Wvw is the only thing that keeps me playing this game.
---
Love all these cept thief and guard.
---
You’ve got good lore and imagination.
---
And they are beautiful ppl, which is why I said waifus. which means wife, a lousy joke that I should perhaps next time think otherwise of telling by the amount of downvotes.  But do enjoy your upvotes by riding on the shame train.
---
Yep idk what other commenters are asking, there's usually nothing interesting going on with non-GvG guilds unless you focus your video on famous commanders. The best players and most organized and competitive groups were usually part of GvG guilds that also dominated open field zergbusting.
---
If you don't want to farm, here's some things you can do
---
Everyday, 15 minutes, get your daily achievements, that's 2 gold right there
---
Kill tequatl one time per day, that's an extra 1 gold right there
---
Daily fractals, open all the encryptions you get, sell the stuff inside. At low tiers, that's probably around 5 gold minimum per day, and at max tier, it's more than that
---
Map meta events in HoT (Verdant Brink Night Cycle, Auric Basin Tarir, Tangled Depths Chak Gerent, and Dragon Stand...well, entire map) and PoF (Crystal Oasis Pinata, Elon Riverlands Doppelganger, Desolation Maw's of Torment or Junundu Rising, and Vabbi Serpent's Ire--probably the hardest one to do consistently--or Forged with Fire) to get unidentified gear and an amalgamated gemstone to sell.
---
This was by far the worst reset i ever done. We been moaning about lag before but today it was like 10 times worse then ever. I was on this reset that the video shows and all people were indeed rubberbanding around, all people having skillag and when i say skill lag i don't mean you have to wait a while, litterally nothing happen at all your skill bar is not responding.
---
And when you finally cast something, nothing happens you do not see number until 10 sec later when some poor guy get hit with everything at the same time and instant dies and wonder what happen. Or the fear that was the best one. At several time i get feared but i get stuck in a loop were i lag and get re-feared, lag-refeared, lag and so on. It kept on going for 30 sec and there was nothing i could do about it becasue there was nothing to use and not possible to dodge because there was no time for that. 
---
And even more fun was for me who swapping atunaments a lot or under water weapons, like in this video my weapon skills do not load in to the bar until 10-20 sec later. That is a whole fight with a bar with no skills each time i swapped attunaments and you swap them a lot because ele and wvw. How the hell am i suppose to play like that?
---
This is not ok. It is not fun and everybody get grumpy and annoyed about it and our reset was simply terrible i am still mad about it because reset in WvW is my favorite day were we start a new mu and the lag killed it. And this is not "normal" lag that has to be said. Something is very broken, more broken then before and Arena Net can not wait it out. Tose things breaks a game fast.
---
All servers in this mu on EB had the same thing. We asked them and they responded they had and we saw it as well. They rubberbanding around noone having a clue were anyone really was.
---
Any comments/plans around gw2taco?
---
Usually at 500 is where you can actually make ascended gear.  So if it follows the same pattern, you'll be grinding from 425 straight to 500 before you can make the final ascended dish.
---
I expect the dinnerware to be made from bloodstone china,  empyreal crystal-ware, and stainless dragonite steel.
---
1: Longbow Necromancer
---
2: Double Pistol Elementalist
---
3: Rifle Ranger
---
Might want to check your sources(assuming you have any?), the borps didn't push forward any meta's, they were too busy stealing builds when build checkers were still in the game to make anything themselves. Calling them out as the best HoT guild is also kind of disingenuous. They were definitely at the top in the gvg scene because they knew how to abuse the differed GHall mechanics well, and played like 5+ days a week, but they got farmed in WvW. I wouldn't take any numbers of GvG's won from them without a large grain of salt. I know our record vs them was significantly better than they claimed but none of us cared enough to actually count it out especially when they were trying to pull some weird Bo9 shit. We also assblasted them at the end of HoT when the meta wasnt just full tank+condi reaper spam with Mojo driving on his 10hr old guard.
---
Then for Hymen they had more in combat logs for GS being snakes with a rifle warrior until GS "randomly" pushed their stack between rounds to overwrite them. Another guild also brought up that they had interference issues with GS during their match. TBF that finals situation could have been handled better but Haru was such a snake and history showed that pretty damn well.
---
Finally no mention of Ark when you give so much history around the Agg/NS/EP/TA days is odd considering they are the only guild that beat Agg in that time period.
---
Don't worry Ascended Food is coming it will fix the lag in EB.
---
I can tell you because i have accounts in both EU and NA and in tier 1 then and now. I play from EU so are used to have a high ping and the lag we faced today is nothing of what you speak of. That was normal lag. This is something more. Something that was added just recently and get worse for each week that passes.
---
How would you say WvW is now still good or?
---
I just bought 50 keys yesterday before the sale... I want to die
---
224 slots here. No scrolling. You can make your inventory wider, you know.
---
i suggest you watch the dev stream with the preview. progress from 425 to 500 was explained.
---
I mean with 500% I was seeing mobs drop multiple silvers. That would still be pretty good even now. 
---
On the other hand ... why use that when I can just use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Peppermint_Omnomberry_Bar same karma boost, more gold and more magic find and probably much cheaper
---
I mail stuff to people all the time. I also mail stuff between accounts, but that's less a use for mail carriers. I'd say I mail stuff probably a dozen times a day, and I receive mail probably that often as well.

I send stuff to new people, I send stuff to guildies, I send stuff to my wife, to friends. In a game where you can't trade directly with people, how can there be not much use for mail...unless you play solo mostly I guess.
