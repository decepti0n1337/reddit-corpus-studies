Wasn't the reason it was remove because it did ***too*** much damage for Condi builds and Anet wanted to remove it because of reliance on it to apply a high damage bleed.
---
---
---
well, pegasus would be one of those according to BoTW and Skyrim ;)
---
A reason why I stopped playing. The content explaining backstory was behind a paywall. Felt to disjointed for me to enjoy it. I bought the game and it's two expansions and I STILL have to pay for the whole story. I'll pass.
---
like I said in another post, just look at Skyrim and BoTW ;)
---
oh boy thats memory lane, i remember that sewer JP. i loved it so much!
---
I suggest Bladed Leggings.
---

---
They have stylish skulls and chains and are one of the bulkiest light armor leggings.
---
Also try Warbeast leggings.
---
Feels like another update in preparation for build templates
---
Welcome back!
---
I'll pay 4k for Aurene skin.
---
And she must also speak to me.
---
Fortunately, Dragonfall is very profitable and very fun.
---
A ground target for its dismount ability... the amount of times I've misjudged where it'll breath fire in one day is stupidly high...
---
Personally I'd prefer a similar engagement skill to that you see aurene doing in the domain map against the scarabs, the cone of fire from right to left. (Mainly see it near the corsair heart) 
---
In terms of buffing it, I'd feel better if just taking off didn't take 20% of your flight juice. I agree that it is a little slow (especially after using the dash and it momentum instantly dissipates) but with its agilness whilst in the air does provide a nice niche in the current mounts. 
---
Also I feel the flight juice should start from where you mount, but some consideration should be made so that theres a cool down mechanic for maintain that height? So you can't keep using the leap skill and then remounting to keep gaining height.
---
How seriously do you take fractal scale 76?
---
Armageddon Helm.  You can purchase it with karma from vendors in Orr that show up at a temple when you purify it.
---
Better than nothing
---
Thanks!
---
But, we went to elementary school together.
---
Finally, I can experiment with a grieving holosmith without tearing my hair out
---
Huh. I have all my mounts hotkeyed, so I had completely forgotten this exists...
---
Don't delete any of these old characters OP. Just a remainder.
---
...Dennis??
---
I want to raid.
---
And by raid, of course, I mean I want two things bought with raid currency. Dhuum's boots and the White Mantle Portal Device.
---
What is the most brainless class with the simplest rotation that I can possibly play, and still be useful? I don't want to be a parasite, but I also don't want to invest a bunch of time learning a class and spec just to toss it away until I see a cosmetic or gadget I want.
---
&gt; why Unity experience, if the game doesn't run on Unity?
---
Because the audio implementation in the GW2 engine most closely resembles the audio implementation in Unity.
---
That's awesome
---
Oh wow, that‚Äôs brilliant. It took me around 20 min and I was already bored. You have more patience for sure ahah
---
Agree to disagree
---
Keyfarm? Do tell.

Lion's Arc is actually something of a sore topic for me. When GW2 was coming out I followed all the news and was so excited to explore LA but my computer couldn't run the game. When I finally had a machine that would run the game it was when LWs2 was wrapping up so I never actually got a change to see it outside of the personal story.
---
I really wish they could bring it back but I think I remember reading somewhere that the files for it are gone.
---
Should have just made it not scale with personal stats.
---
Or made it a condition that doesn't do damage.
---
Weakness, cripple, vuln any would have been nice.
---
dat tempest storm ;)
---
I'd be all over a dragonfly..and with the hovering it makes sense.
---
kill the right mob and it‚Äôs around 1.5k base exp and 9.8k bonus exp on top. kill vet and it‚Äôs 3.8k + 9.8k :D

For power, I'd say d/d deadeye. For condi, there's shortbow/shortbow soulbeast.
---
For raid training, the only server that's remotely active is Raid Academy.
---
https://discord.gg/2X9Mpfw
---
I have a PoF only alt and have gone out of my way to gear my soulbeast and mirage in as much viper's gear as possible..
---
I can appreciate this change in terms of consistency, but man, having something you've actually worked for just taken away like that, I gotta be honest, that feels pretty fucking bad. I guess I won't be raiding much on that alt then, since both w5 and w6 have bosses where condi is preferable, but PoF has no condi stats..
---
Mounts are definitely a bonus, but no, it's not necessary to get PoF straight off the bat. HoT is still regularly played, but the content just seems to be harder and more confusing. In turn though, it also tends to be more replayable with large scale map meta events.
---
It never occurred to me until now that I can barrell roll upwards...
---
You're mean.
---
This little platform is a new area they added a patch or two ago. The main area does kick you out if you don‚Äôt have a pass.
---
The descent should consist of dismounting and seeing which one gives the largest fall damage (assuming you can dismount on Skyscale, I don't have one yet :( )
---
Yesssss I love that the new map is beetle friendly, riding through the isles at lightspeed until trouble unfolds, haha.
---
I just got mine two days before my skyscale. May I ask ... what video?
---
*cries*
---
"I want people to know that this color is black and this color is white."
---
This might be related to graphics settings, but at least on low settings I can't help but feel like these gloss effects are generally overtuned, so I agree with Icy_Concern.
---
Looking at the heavy set again I can see your point though, some of the reflections definitely make the pieces seem more metallic. But overall quite intense, especially when the actual armor is the only part on the character that seems to be lighted that way.
---
Also, considering the things the character is doing I'd probably just prefer not having to look at overly brightly polished armor all the time.
---
On the other hand this is coming from someone still confused over why ANet saw fit to "fix" the lighting on the Racing Scarf by seemingly washing out all color and laminating it, so...
---
God Scarlet was such a good character though...
---
Same for me, I had the game preordered, but I only played a little of season 1 and 2 before I got a better machine.
---
Aaah yes, now I remember! I got the game after Scarlet's war, but now I remember to have seen that scene as well, I guess I forgot because of the infinite amount of time I've spent in the Domain of the Lost
---
Been having some issues purchasing the character slot in game. I've tried card and paypal but it still errors. Is there a known issue to that?
---
You did it cuz Mordy was controlling you and you never at any point had any free will?
---
Eh idk, her motive was literally ‚Äúoh an elder dragon is controlling me‚Äù
---
I appreciate the fact that you kept recording all the way down as you fell.
---
I believe you can buy this with snowflakes and karma during Wintersday. Much cheaper - I have a stack of about 100 - makes every character an emergency Mesmer.
---
All of those would be way too good! lol
---
Was kinda annoying for a large character
---
I really miss that boss, Anet plz.
---
There is nothing better than watching people get stomped on by high heels because they weren‚Äôt paying attention.
---
Dungeons in general are run less than they used to be, and have largely been replaced by fractals and in part by raids
---
But even at the end game level, you won't get as much build variety without PoF, nor can you get into the latest raids, but you definitely won't be left behind just for having HoT
---
Nope.
---
The Bladed armour set is cool for the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù look too, but it can be hard to match with other pieces.
---
I hope this NEVER happens.
---
speaking of gold, is there a ressource for how to make money, either through farm or broken up by crafting professions? i find myself consistently broke, looking at the price for griphon makes me rather sad
---
Since PvE masteries have no effect in WvW, the best way to do it is probably giving one of the mounts that have 3 masteries and no shared mastery a 4th one that gives a condition to each mount. The Skyscale would be the best choice since they do Burning already.
---
* Raptor, Springer, Rollerbeetle: Confusion. Because concussions.
---
* Skimmer: Poison. Because she's basically a stingray.
---
* Jackal: Torment. Because they are made with Tormented Sands.
---
* Griffon, Warclaw: Bleeding, because they are kitties, and kitties be scratching.
---
* Skyscale: Already come with burning.
---
You‚Äôre missing indigo.
---
Open a ticket with support and they should resolve it within a day. Not sure what causes it, but support can fix it pretty quick. 
---
Expansions are totally worth it :D
---
I see why you quit....I also wouldn't want to look at that monstrosity.
---
I finally unlocked my Skyscale today! Thanks so much to all the redditors who contributed and/or compiled this thread. Your guides were lifesavers! GW2 really has a great community.
---
Hell, you could break maps with the glider as well. I remember being in the skritt cavern area in silverwastes and gliding to one of the edges from the ship and being able to just walk out of the map.
---
Yeah I can't deal with ESO any longer I'm tearing my hair out at it. Is this game significantly better.
---
By this definition, every MMO I've ever played is a facebook game. On MMOs people always talk about farming.
---
I've come to the opinion the reason MMOs and even Facebook games are so popular is because we're genetically programmed to be hunters and gatherers...and that's all MMOs end up being. Hunting and gathering.
---
I did the same for my mesmer, years ago. We seem to have 3 of the same pieces.
---
I always liked shields, and with a shield it feels weird to not wear proper armor.
---
Thanks! I'm debating between necro and warrior now, I'm gonna try em both out.
---
I should change it to Abbadon_
---
Why are folks so excitable about the berries?  
---
525 Blood Rubies + 12k Unbound Magic will get you a full set of Blood Ruby pendant, backpack, and two rings.  And you can re-stat them all for 100 Unbound Magic...
---
It was already awesome, and seems to be the biggest winner from this.  Just add accessories.
---
I'm at least glad to see that even if that's just the one dye channel, at least it's the whole animal.
---
Not like the, "You can have any color you want with the purple wings" griffon...
---
Fennecs back!
---
The endgame, servers and overall monetisation is in a pretty bad place and they are going down the pay to skip road I can't support. I love ESO because of the people but it's not enough to keep playing. It's like a second job, boring stale and I do it to keep up with dailies etc.
---
When do new items go on sale? How does the rotation on old items work? Do I need to check every day during TP reset or once a week? I could never figure this out
---
I just got fed up with the blandness. I'm a huge TES fan but ESO just dropped the ball in making me care at all. I did play it but I also realized how much I was gambling with it. The loot crates are so awful in that game. I dropped so much on a game I didn't even care for in the end but held on due to my fuzzy feelings for TES.
---
This saddens me greatly
---
Yeah it's pretty hard all around in regards to the crown store etc.
---
I'll definitely stick GW2 on download and give it a whirl tomorrow.
---
It's Guild Wars 2. There's no "gear catch up" needed. Exotic is still perfectly fine for all open world content. If you want the most powerful gear, it's still Ascended gear.
---
If all of your runes, food, etc. are also contributing to your main stat(s), then Ascended is about a 9% stat bump. If your runes, food, etc. are boosting something other than your main stat, Ascended armor, weapon, and trinkets will be about a 17% bump over Exotic.
---
The big change you'll find is that you probably have a bunch of skills and traits that are different than they used to be. Double-check the functionality of all of your skills and traits.
---
Had? He still sounds the same to me.
---
I think it's mostly fine. I think that it's fine that it's slower than the other mounts, I think that it should be. The Griffon should remain the peak speed in the air, in exchange for having lower mobility. Get where you're going on a Griffon, get to specific locations on a Skyscale. 
---
That said, I do think that it could maintain altitude better than it does, and I don't really get the point of the wall grab, when it doesn't regen flight juice. That element seems mostly a nuisance, making it harder to land normally against irregular surfaces.
---
The only times I've ever seen it spawn was after completing the jumping puzzle leading there all the way from the river down below.
---
But of course it could be just a coincidence.
---
Yeah there's way too much blue going on, they should make one of them green. \*OCD intensifies\*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For real though this looks nice wish it actually looked like this in game.
---
and here i was wondering in trying ESO myself for looking for a nice fresh air change since i was looking for a nice balance between Main Story and Action Combat...
---
I'm expecting a winged Warclaw.
---
The Skyscale should've been easier to get. This entire quest to get it should've been a quest to get the Aurene skin. IMO
---
Awesome. This will make getting expensive stat combinations in Exotic armour (like Viper) so much cheaper AND easier, if this actually applies to all stat select-able armour.
---
Yes please!
---
back then like a week. got really quick responses but just 1 per day
---
I just did that part of LS4 and I was surprised to see Braham not be a little bitch and have some dialogue that made me like him a bit. I hope for this trend to continue, but also fear that he may be killed off after his redemption.
---
This is one of the best part of the expansion in my opinion, it did a brief recap of everything until you "went in this area" so even ppl who skipped everything before hand know briefly what had happened. 
---
This is one of the thing i like PoF, it is newbie-friendly, content are soloable, and mounts, of course
---
Power reaper is absurdly overpowered in the the open world and only gets buffed every patch. Last time it got damage boost AND passive healing from all damage. 
---
There used to be some other "fun" builds, but they all just feel weak in comparison.
---
Go for it. It's a great game. No sub, action combat, fantastic story (with more depth than the PG13 story GW2 pulls out) and lots of rewards and things to earn from dungeons, delves, trials, PvP and questing.
---
Very sad to see posts like these get little upvotes while post like people getting their first legendaries for the 1000x times get 500+ upvotes and hits the frontpage.
---
Well, i mean, they don't use unbound magic anymore.  And if there's one thing anet likes, it's putting people on an even playing field, so we're likely to get a new currency (again) in season 5.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt step foot in any raids or even fractals but you can get away with anything for the rest of the open world.
---
Runes and Sigils will really help.
---
Food and Utility potions are pretty great bang for your buck.
---
Welcome back and enjoy
---
Firebrand, because i can get quickness while gathering (i really gather a lot)
---
Renegade with shortbow for meta events
---
Gotcha, thats good to know about the mes tanks... I would had tried it in fractals. 
---
The new specs that came with the xpacs, can a fresh character access them or are they for late game?
---
In short, you need to buy a lot of them. But really efficient for quick harvesting.
---
what was weird to me, is that the advanced version doesn't use those shaders(?) that they normally have (mistforged vs basic), but the basic one has it. that shiny layer.
---
You have to unlock them at level 80 after you've unlocked every other skill and trait. Each elite specialization takes a total of 250 hero points to unlock, and the entirety of other other skill and trait costs 398.
---
That being said, the expansion maps give more hero points (10 per node) compared to the base game maps (1 per node)
---
Guarding
---
I guess thats their way of getting us to go out and explore the new zones quickly...as if I'm not excited already lol
---
Heya, I am a new player as well. Just 5 days into gw2, love the game! Probably thinking of buying the 2 expac further down. 
---
Do let me know if u want to hit the dungeons further as you level to explore the story, I been hoping to find peeps to lvl and play with.
---
It wouldnt be gw2 if something wasnt bugged blocking your progress.
---
A+ on the amount of unnecessarily complex explanations
---
beautiful elaborate mass-PR edited way to slip in a change that probably just wants free2play people to buy expansions.
---
kudos though, i like the change
---
It'll be Aurene though.
---
Doesn't need to breath fire. Just needs to make a fire field.
---
The "stop holding forward" thing doesn't work in many cases. For one, you have to, y'know, *move* to land at your desired destination. If you have the spare flight juice to go up a bit more and then drop on it then sure that's fine albeit objectively slower, but if you're near the end of a flight or pushing the upper limit then hope you don't get stuck in a latch loop. With the mastery + enough stamina to launch it's not as bad I guess? Still doesn't feel great.
---
Exactly the same with a lot of things in life... Never do skritt maths about it! XD 
---
I could do the same from december 2012 to september 2017. I could but I won't. (-:
---
[removed]
---
It's not a good week, when I don't end up in a place, that was not supposed to be reachable and I don't have skyscale yet :D
---
Last week, I got stuck, when I flew around Augury Rock and I ended up inside an invisible room (maybe inside of mesh?), that was high above the front entrance. Not even springer could get me out of there :D
---
Probably most wtf moment was, when I jumped madly through some dredge tunnels and I actually managed to jump into something like ventilation shaft and I was surprised, when there were broken textures and basically end of the map further down, because it was actually pretty easy to get there. Like I was convinced that it was genuine tunnel somewhere, that was meant to be used by players. It was in time of LW1/2 so there were no mounts or gliders :D
---
Is it possible to stop with this kind of pictures ? I missed the whole season one since Southsun island... And i'm happy when I discover Scarlet or and reference to first LW. It helps me understand what happened in Tyria. It makes the words "living world" mean something. 
---
Anet, please keep on doing this.
---
just make it a giant erotic female naked furry with wings and we'll have enough money raised for 2 expansions next year
---
And yet people wonder why I do fast lucrative dailies. ;)
---
Get ready to see a lot of big bird-lions everywhere
---
That‚Äôs what I figured but I wasn‚Äôt sure. Soulbeast seems fun though, just debating on build for it.

Trying out something different retelling Guild Wars lore through song. Ideally, I want it to be as if Aurene is singing about overcoming her traumatic death when she was dead before AND after her re-awakening. This music story is also a tribute to Aurene, her allies, and the late Monty Oum. Blue border text is Aurene, Red border text are her allies. The song is called Armed and Ready. If you like the video let us know :D. Subscribe if you want to see more random videos from us!

Legendary armor. Here's your long term goal.
---
I consider gorrik and blish essentially members of dragons watch by now.
---
I play both games. I would not say GW2 is better. It's just different. Of the two, I prefer ESO. You sound like you need a change though, so GW2 should be good for you. It's an awesome game in small doses. Just don't go into it expecting depth.
---
Goddamit, this is cool!
---
We have ground and underwater fight. All that's left is airborne boss fight! PC vs SkyHydra
---
The intro of gorrik has added another character who is sciency so they can use him sometimes too instead of always taimi. I've enjoyed that. It'd be nice if they actually had the science wrong sometimes tho... Right now the asura always feel like the science guy Walter from Fringe.
---
In case you didnt know...you can buy a portal scroll for 1k volatile magic and some silver and give it to any character to get into the map. No it doesn't solve the grind at all, but it makes it take less time since you can use alts at least.  
---

Try Zolpidem or you can start counting how many skyscales there are.
---
No, it's a good question! You're right when you say there are TONS of armor pieces in Guild Wars 2, including the first 80 levels. However generally they're differentiated through their looks, not so much the stats they hold. For example, I have two heavy armor characters geared with the same stat combination, but their armor sets are different because there are probably 20 sets in the game that have those stats. If you look at all the different things you can craft, Weaponsmithing actually has more variation in specific items considering Armorsmithing is just "helmet, shoulders, chestpiece, gloves, leggings and boots" whereas Weaponsmithing is "axes, daggers, swords, greatswords, maces, hammers, spears, and shields." However this is all just opinion, and if you want to vary up your look while playing I'd strongly recommend Armorsmithing first then! Some of the craftable sets actually look really nice as they're more realistic looking to armor in real life, which is a breather from some of the armor given to you by reaching certain levels.
---
That doesn't mean new projects weren't started. In fact, I guarantee they were.
---
They don't do nearly enough questioning of you, but there are some cool moments
---
Yeah I can't play anything else in open world anymore, to be honest. Reaper is just so much stronger than any other option because of the self-boons (especially quickness), burst, and cleave.
---
I quit ESO in favor of gw2 in feb. This year. I had gotten sick of the repetitious gameplay, extreme monetization and shite servers.
---
Biggest draw though, is the games patience. ESO had been ramping up rewards for playing daily significantly and i felt exhausted trying to catch up. Guild Wars waits for me, lets me miss a week or two with no consequence.
---
Seems like smbd didn't try gw2style.com
---
Just give it a look at how many awesome community designes there are! Best inspirational start poi t for your Fashion Wars 2!
---
I tried this in Divinity's Reach, and it didn't work. But then I tried that same way point, and I recreated it, twice.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt even be that hard, just have some research team ‚Äòexamining‚Äô it to figure out how it works, then when it‚Äôs time for it to spawn just have it be that one of the research team presses the wrong button or something, triggering the fight
---
There wont be gw3. Their background projects were shit down and 30 of company laid off. They wont make new mmo in 3 years from scraps even if they get funding for something new from ncsoft ever again. Its gw2 or die for anet currently.
---
Baaa baaa black skyscale have you any feathers

Yes sir yes sir 3 bags full

Also one of the Heart of Thorns instances-and plague signet won't remove it.

If I get a named Sunspear weapon before unlocking the specialzation collection requiring that weapon will the weapon still be unlocked in the collection even if I don't have it anymore?

Would it not be a Skhydra?

Nonsense. She's that woman you run past at the end of the Thaumanova Reactor fractal. She's at the centre because that's where you mash F to get to the boss.

As a British person: is she meant to sound British? I know the sylvari have a vaguely nonspecific English twang, but Scarlet is *so* off with her accent.

There's absolutely no way I could ever see them reducing the cost for this. Currencies are far too easy to farm in large amounts.

---
No, that's no Hydra. That's a straight up biblical angel, all wings and eyes and scary and shit.
---
The combat (which kept people playing for years) and the servers are better. Story is worse when one compares the overall stories of each game.
---
How long have you been playing GW2 anyway?
---
&gt; Should I be getting the expansion now or wait for a sale to come up? Is there like a good time to get the expansion?
---
I assume you are playing on a Free account. If that is the case then getting the expansions sooner is better rather than later. You will not only lift your free account restrictions like chat, Trading post but will also get the Daily login rewards which accumulate quite some money overtime (IIRC there was someone who only played for two years on their free account and never got a single login reward which was quite a bit of money that they missed). Generally speaking, you would only need the Expansions when you reached level 80.
---
We can't tell you when the next sale will come because ArenaNet doesn't tell us those things (and why should they from a business perspective?!), the game will have their 7th anniversary in August and there might or might not be a sale then.
---
You can look [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/retailers/) for official retailers in your area and digital to find a good price. DLGamer has both versions for $38.
---
&gt; Should I just get the Path of Fire or Hearts of Thorn, or just both?
---
That depends of how much you want to spend. Each expansion continues the playable story and speaking from a purely story progression point of view you would need to play the story in the following order:
---
1. Personal Story (You already can play this)
---
2. Living World Season 1 (not accessible at the moment)
---
3. Living World Season 2 (you need to buy it from the gem store)
---
4. Heart of Thorns Expansion
---
5. Living World Season 3 (you need to buy it from the gem store) 
---
6. Path of Fire Expansion
---
7. Living World Season 4 (the latest Episode (6) you got for free while logging in since the 14th of May)
---
Which means, you can either get them both and just wait to play them or get heart of thorns first and Path of fire later.
---
&gt; And ides on how long the game will continue?
---
We know that the Living world will continue into season 5. Since season 4 concluded with episode 6 on the 14th of may, season 5 might begin sometime in 2-3 months. If they keep to their release schedule of 2-3 month each episode and will also keep to 6 episodes per season we would have from 12 up to 18 months of content.
---
There also doesn't seem to be anything else than GW2 "on the table" so they don't have anything else in the fire currently, at least as far as I know from the recent information. The game is in a good state and the devs earn a quite some money with it each year so I don't see a reason why the game would shut down or go on maintenance mode anytime soon.
---
Don't forget about Pact Supply Tokens that you can get 6 per day in like 3 minutes since HoT

That's pretty damn cool.
---
This game is very alt friendly 
---
Keep the character you play with your friends and create a new one to play with on your own pace.
---

---
More than that - it was tested on a freshly reinstalled Windows so nothing could interfere with that. The result is still immediate crash.
---
I know that they are workarounds and all the rest of the stuff but sometimes they just don't work.
---
Besides, if we read the specs of the Vulkan, it is much closer to the hardware in terms of API so it should bring better performance than the DX12 stub.
---
Yeah you keep the progress as long as you own the skin, so if you get the Sword for example you unlock both Weaver and Holosmith collection progress.
---
These are confusing times
---
Haha, thanks, am not yet used to reddit
---
You guys can play the story together, from a certain point on you can even progress the story together. Story is very linear and with all the living world parts + 2 expansions it's also a fairly lengthy story.
---
Correct. Skyboxes in games are rendered beyond all other geometry, so you can't really "reach" it.
---
I'm in a country where the average wage is $300 a month. I do spoil myself with a game every now and then but there's limits and I won't spend on microtransactions or even things like LW episodes.
---
In my case farming in-game might actually be worth it.
---
I believe someone already said this but if a person is set in boosting their character, they will most likely stick to that decision. 
---
All I can say is that you can let them boost to 80, get a feel for what their character will be like in end game and let them decide what they want to do from there (E.g. if they want to continue leveling with your other friend, playing through the expansions, etc)
---
As much as everyone's benefits for leveling from 1-80 makes sense, the levelling experience in the core game sucks ass honestly. I can see why some people can get impatient. 
---
I had a friend who boosted to 80 to skip the natural progression and they much preferred what the game had to offer in the expansions. 
---
The tldr is you either let them play the way they want or you can force them to play another way and risk making them hate the game.
---
I play both. I like them. I‚Äôll still say GW2 is my main game.
---
Yes please! However, what sucks is that if they do this, they probably won‚Äôt release branded pack, since branded Warclaw is already a part of a different set. Same for cosmic set and beetle. And those are my two favorite mount themes in game. :(
---
I prefer Action Camera because it is so good at switching targets like you mentioned in your original post.  I highly recommend you try it.
---
Any panel (like inventory) that you open will automatically toggle Action Cam off, then on again once that window is closed.
---
You'll really only have to manually toggle it off when you want to precisely select something.  Like when 2 npc's are standing on top of each other.
---
&gt; Yeah you keep the progress as long as you own the skin
---
No, just unlocking the skin won't work. You need to accountbound the weapon itself. eg if you use it in the forge it will unlock the skin but won't count for the collection.
---
&gt;Is the trans thing a joke
---
No, many people in society today take it quite seriously.
---
Just because you have a high ping doesn't necessarily or most likely mean the servers are at fault.
---
If your packages run over a faulty router, switch or any other device then they could get routed to the wrong location or even get lost or discarded for whatever reason. But not every package you are sending are running over the same infrastructure. Which means that while you have issues with GW2 and you can ping google or play any other game without a problem STILL doesn't mean that the game servers have issues.
---
Get WINMTR or Pingplotter and get the GW2 IP with /ip and let it run for a while. I bet you have package loss somewhere on your route outside of ArenaNets grasp. If that is the case then you need to contact your ISP and let them know.
---
I love this meme
---
If you're interested in the story you *can* play through Season 2 without paying for it by co-oping with someone who already has it unlocked.
---
You won't get missions rewards, but you will be able to experience the story.  Here is a [good guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/) with videos and short stories for experiencing the story in order.
---
In a daily run I can get 400+ berries. Rubies just pale in comparison even with the buff :(
---
I noticed SF was marked full a couple of nights back as well.  It's odd! But I didn't want to bring attention to it in the off chance we'd somehow silently become a wvw bandwagon or a safe haven for those trying to escape their T1 link.  I was hoping it's because of people returning or joining for Skyscale.
---
If SF is now a wvw bandwagon, it'll likely be marked full till the new relinks the last Friday of June (or another month) and could possibly become a host.
---
If PVE / new players joining for PVE is the reason for fullness, then I'd expect the numbers to stabilize once the Skyscale rush has slowed over the next couple of weeks.
---
The problem with auto target for me is the following. If I miss click an enemy with a skill it will change target.  
---
Even with auto attack it changes target.  
---
I tried putting lock target... Tried right clicking my enemy... But it always changes to another target if I have the cross hair on another enemy by mistake.  
---
I'm kinda a returning player so this was bothering me alot so only tonight I figured out it was because of auto target.   
---
When there are alot of enemies... It's hard to put the cross hair on the enemy you want.... Any way to fix this? Because without auto target on the truth it's I need to right click every enemy I wanna kill and that's also very annoying!
---
Oh the nostalgia of that image hits me right in the feels.
---
because especs are not a secondary, they are a subclass
---
Only one problem freshly reinstalled windows can have is a drivers and bloatware that patches in process code.
---
Yes we not found souce, but it will be found in the end.
---
honestly, why the rush? i havent even finished the first skyscale collection yet as i mostly raid ir have reallife
---
why does that matter besides "muh gw1"
---
They are playing hide-a-seak in the jacuzzi
---
It says 10% endurance recharge rate per stack, up to 5 stacks.
---
That's a bit sad.
---
Hahaha I have a toon that looks just like that back in 2014. XD
---
&gt; Your wasted gold.
---
Come on, no pot can be big enough to contain *all* of my wasted gold.
---
whatever 
---
but
---
the final battle in lions arch was great and so the marionette fight.
---
Which is the other map besides Bloddstone Fen? I bought S3 as a new player because of the Bitterfrost stuff.
---
So I need to make the 39.37 fractal in order to make the most money...?
---
Buy them with Volatile Magic daily from the new map (max 5 per day) and find someone with the nodes in their home instance to gather daily (another 3 per day?). Mix in some gameplay on specific maps when you feel like it. It will add up over time quicker than you'd expect.
---
You can complete the reward track even solo in exactly the same time. Just solo cap camps for example and keep the partecipation at tier 6.
---
We all knew we were gonna need 250 LS4 currencies considering that‚Äôs what we needed for Aurora. Just what we‚Äôd need them for was unknown
---
But I came here for NSFW aurene animations! WHERE.
---
This myfinalform thing is something straight out of jrpg.
---
What are your favorites? Yeah they might, but most maps are still breakable even without mounts. Lion's Arch Vault room is still one of mine.
---
Indeed.
---
I recommend just skipping it by using the free piece of food you get given or make one to skip it if you already used the free one.
---
However, the waypoints to the starter maps are all unlocked from the start, so you could just play 5 races and decide to explore the shiverpeaks together, playing through the story of the Norn.
---
Dont ascended accessories have a chance to drop 1300g item when you salvage .
---
what does keep participation at tier 6 mean? If i may ask?
---
And it still has good survivability for killing groups and whatnot?
---
But getting gear is playing the game...
---
Commenting to bookmark so I can cross check with my own ranger's build later üòÅ
---
So they just disappear from their guild to go off on some adventure without us?
---
Firebrand/quickbrand. Very very rarely do I have someone out dps me in a squad, while im providing 100% quickness to some peeps and have tome 2 and 3 for extra healing/protective boons.
---
It also has great tagging abilities with F1 tome resetting after each mob kill ( tome skill 4 large aoe )
---
A++ for easy DPS and tagging
---
B+ for survivability
---
Twisted Marionette fight in Lornar's Pass brought one of the best boss fight soundtracks I ever heard.
---
[Here are those lines from the wiki.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Auditorium#Ambient_dialogue)
---
Monthlies were remove a long time ago.
---
t. scheduled GvG-man.
---
Go to open field and have your silly GvG there.
---
How do you break stuns and/or cure conditions on this build?  Or do you swap in skills as needed?
---
It too bad those two character slots are empty.  If they had characters only to be left at level 1, they would have been accruing birthday gifts too!  Welcome back, you got **8** mounts to go wrangle now!
---
&gt;Quality quality of life
---
Sorry I had to
---
We need this season back. Explain it as a simulator sequence. Mist time traveling or anything.
---
They disappeared because the game already has too many pointless characters
---
There is no reason to do so.
---
Very nice! What I am especially looking forward to is the comparison between speed clear and PUG strategies. I re-entered fractals for the first time after 5 years recently, and, not wanting to be unprepared, watched a guide video. Essentially, none of the recommended strategies were followed. Was not sure at all on how to adapt.
---
Also, what differences in builds are required between fractals and raids and especially what the reasoning is behind the changes would help me a lot.
---
Finally, as I only set my game to german so my friends can understand what I am talking about when mentioning anything game related while I am playing with them, it would be nice if you put the name of any skill or trait you mention on screen in videos as not to disturb the flow of talking but at the same time help recognize the skill. I usually think of weapon skills mainly as "focus 4" or "GS 1", but that's less useful for utility skills.
---
Hope this insight from a casual who still likes to be effective helps and, ideally, you know all this already :-D
---
Even better, for new players you can buy stuff like Bladed armor set and choose any stats you want. So full vipers isn't that annoying to get anymore! (if you want to condi in open world for some reason)
---
Maybe this will increase some VB event runs in hopes for armor boxes for alts
---
They went off to get married and are honeymooning in a private villa in Southsun.

Well, the day before Exordium came out, when Wood had spiked to 2.2-2.4 silver and more, my Orr wood route (Straits, Malchor, Siren's Landing) was giving up to 16-18g per hour in a combination of both Elder Wood and Mithril. Once you account for the TP taxes, you actually came out ahead compared to the 20g you get from Silverwastes. Plus, it was easier to maintain that level of income farming Elder Wood, since you only follow a route and don't have to actively play to tag events.
---
Unfortunately, with Wood back down below 2s, dedicated wood farming's not as profitable as farming gold to buy wood.
---
I literally just explained how I did it with zero grinding and I only played the story chapters and some map completion here and there and tbh I don‚Äôt like the maps too much.
---
Mfking power rangers trying to fuse together I swear
---
You just missed a 50% sale that ended on the 19th.  No one knows when the next sale will be, but it might be in August Anniversary sale.
---
The only region that is locked is China - otherwise keys can be bought/used in any region.  Avoid unofficial retailers because the keys could've been bought with stolen credit cards and result in your account being permanently banned.
---
i had 0 of each cuz i consumed them for vm but it's not a problem really i farmed all the nodes, hearts, metas and map  compilation with 3 chars and got them in less than 12 hrs
---
I also want to have a heavily-armored DD ele. It's a tough world.
---
For person with 11 geared chars that can do berry farm it is like spit in the face. "We do not want you to play our game, return tomorrow, go away, play other games, leave your money elsewhere". If need trinkets for my new WvW build, and I can get it today I would do it, even if it is berry farm + sirens landing 11x. 
---
Sole reason I quit t4 and 99CM is daily cap. Playing for 1 hour a day, when I have free day off and want to play 6 hours in a row of only fractals hurts.
---
Well what content are you playing through? 
---
* Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire actually require certain masteries to progress the story. eg. Gliding Updraft Use (HoT), Raptor Canyon Jumping (PoF). So you may want to prioritise them in that order if you are playing through story. 
---
* Central Tyria masteries are basically - do you play Fractals? Are you going to make a Legendary soon? If no, just fill out Pact Mentor first lol
---
Just an FYI - look into [experience boosting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience). As a new player you might not have access to all of the boosters but you can seriously burned through mastery levels with your boosts on. It really save so much time.
---
&gt; You just missed a 50% sale that ended on the 19th.
---
just my luck again, bummer.
---
I guess August would be too long of a wait for me or rather, it depends on how much things I can do endgame wise on the free account.
---
Would I be able to gear up decently on a free account or would it maybe even be recommended to play through the "base game" first to learn all the things before I potentially throw a lot more "new things" to learn at myself?
---
It's pretty standard practice to keep development going, they may have abaondoned current projects but it's quite likely they picked up new ones that are probably more realistic for them to do.   
---
Companies always do that since game development takes years. I'd be really suprised if they did only GW2 since literally no game company currently invests their all into one single game.
---
why are you getting down-voted?
---
Skydra.....c'mon!

---
Server transfers can be done through the Character Select screen. Gem price is dependent on your desired server's population density.
---
&gt; Also, is there still that elitist group of players stacking in corners in dungeons with all beserker gear? 
---
Dungeons have kinda fell of the radar over the years as ANet moved from developing/updating them to releasing Fractals. People still do dungeons and with the power creep of elite specialisations they're kind of a joke now. 
---
Check out [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) or [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) for good build resources. Generally speaking Beserker is still king, though it's class/specialisation dependent. LoS targets its still useful. I feel like elitism in the game has probably moved on a bit now you'll find it in Fractals and Raids.
---
There are official retailers that give discounts. Since ur not lvl 80 yet theres no rush, a discount will probly happen in the coming months
---
I'd unlock the raptor mount first and then finish the Pact Commander mastery line for the autoloot function of the [last mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Advanced_Logistics). It's just *so* good. 
---
After that you can unlock anything you think is interesting at your own pace. Just keep in mind that HoT mastery points and exp can only be obtained in HoT maps, PoF in PoF maps and Core Tyria in the rest of maps+fractals.
---
Yes you can region transfer from NA to EU (will cost some gems, varies by cost depending on the server population) by clicking the world selection button in the lower left of the character select screen. Do note that PvE is also on a megaserver system now, so its beneficial to transfer into a "cheaper" world as you get back into the swing of things before choosing one for WvW if you plan on doing that.
---
As for the dungeon meta, rest in peace. The content is practically dead due to it not aging very well along with the power creep and lack of support over the years. People still run them from time to time but you'll be seeing people brute force encounters in most cases.
---
A 2nd profession would flat out not work in GW2 because the game is just not build around this possibility. It would also bring a lot of things back that the developers consciously decided against by making GW2 in the first place, balancing issues. GW1 had a huge amount of skills and had quite a lot balancing issues in which someone, somewhere always found a way which made the balance patch for certain skills look like a joke. With how many combinations you could create builds in GW1 the amount of work to balance all those things was never ending.
---
The Spear you got on your back is bound to the special action hotkey. It would probably much better to just give a profession a certain weapon with an elite spec which then has their own Weapon skills instead of clamping it to your back and being able to use it with a special action hotkey which then would need to be expanded with more UI elements just to give more variety of skills for that "pseudo-weapon".
---
While a 2nd profession wouldn't work I don't see a reason why you couldn't be a Paragon, Ritualist or Derwish in GW2 through elite specs.
---
Which means, with the elite specs you already have the possibility to get those Professions, we only need to get them in a way that makes sense for the content and the core profession they will be unlocked for. Ritualist would make sense for Necro. Derwish for maybe Thief and paragon for Warrior (since it already got the shield and shouts).
---
What you then can do with the elite spec is up to how they implement it but we don't need a 2nd profession to be able to play them in the first place.
---
If you played GvG in GW1 you are not entitled to say dozens of people one every server to go fuck yourself in other game.
---
The reason why I love the game is because there is no pressure to do anything. My advice to you is just enjoy the game and exploration as you want too.
---
What do you do with 24 characters?
---
Yea, you can juuuuust see her legs in the silhouette one!
---
Yeah, playing a Derwish as a Charr would be pretty strange because of the whole becoming the "physical embodiment of a god" but the others could work.
---
If only you'd taken 86 less damage
---
Woops
---
he is just watching his brethrens in the front
---
I don‚Äôt see taking 10 mins of doing dailies as grinding. I don‚Äôt queue for PvP matches I just go into a daily room for I only do the WvW dailies  that take zero effort (veteran slayer, big spender, caravan disruptor  Ruin capture, or land claimer
---
I guess at least these require other gameply time to accrue the jarma to buy them? But yeah they are are huge amount of extra bonus gold daily
---
First born watching over the next generation.
---
Mesmer main 4 life!
---
Power chrono owns easy content like central Tyria, can pull its weight against bosses and has good tagging with GS (add Sigil of Fire) and Mantra of Pain.
---
Staff mirage wades through waves of mobs and kills veterans+elites almost as quickly as power chrono, is a lot safer/easier against bosses and generally nigh impossible to kill unless the enemy has ranged hitscan. It is a condi build though so central Tyria &gt;lvl30 kinda sucks.
---
Mirage with greatsword (Sigil of Stamina!) still is one of the best lootstick builds for dumb zergs such as the Labyrinth.
---
Plus all the usual mesmer things such as Blink, Portal, loldistort and the option of spamming mantras with Inspiration traited if you really need to facetank sustain.
---
In terms of general power and "ease of play" in a single build I'd vote for power reaper though. An expert chrono can probably do better in most cases but it's like 3-5x the effort for 5-10% extra performance. If you don't like adjusting traits and utilities on the fly definitely reaper over mesmer.
---
Great! Thanks.
---
He used Violet (Purple). Just the primary colours and secondaries. Nothing fancy.
---
I think that's a Getz
---
STOP DOWNVOTING THIS.... It is 100% accurate!
---
At the end of the other season to get the end of season reward (Aurora) one of the steps is to use a stack of all map currency.
---
That‚Äôs how anet set in place the full living story purchase requirements (by linking a gift from each region basically) so everyone already knew the end of season reward or whatever it would be... would include at least one step that was... ‚Äúcollect a stack from all maps currency‚Äù.
---
Everyone who knew about celestial armor also knew about charged quartz.... 
---
Please stop complaining just because ‚Äúyou‚Äù didn‚Äôt know. (And didn‚Äôt ask friends or even wiki it)
---
I hope for Pact Chopper skin. Just imagine.
---
Hail Skydra!
---
I recently got it from war eternal supply drop pack.  
---
That pack among other goodies also had an item called Black Lion Outfit Ticket which lets you chose any outfit released so far. Unsure if it‚Äôs still available in the gemstore, since it disappeared from there for me once I bought it, however, anet also had outfit ticket alone up for sale during last anniversary sale in August, so it might happen again soon?
---
depends on what your issue is and how bust support is, their standard policy is upto 72 hours (3 days) but it may be slower than that atm due to ther living world release last week.
---
Nothing stops anyone or their servants to creat a Leyline manifest and awaken :0 like scarlet did ! :0
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates
---
Really? No one's going to say it?  
---
CAUSE I'M FREE  
---
FREE FAAAAAAAAALING
---
We can have another "scarlet" to blow up some Leyline concentrated energy safe to awaken something else :P !
---
There's several hundreds of threads with the same question.
---
3 to 14 days is the usual. Don't submit multiple tickets, you only shoot yourself in the foot by resetting your place in the queue.
---
Could you do a brief summary of the main or big things please? Most of that is bug updates, kinda annoying to dredge through it all haha. Sorry if it's too much to ask!
---
Usual respond time should be 72 hours.
---
However, this can get longer depending on the following things:
---
1. How often you sent new tickets instead of updating your existing one
---
2. How complicated your issue is
---
3. How many information you provided
---
4. How much they have to do
---
be patient and wait until they get back to you, if you haven't heard anything in 3-7 days then update your ticket and wait again. Nothing really something else you can do than submit the information that could help and wait.
---
I understand, but I think 28th is a decent base for anyone that started early. First possible date was this Tuesday if you had all currencies. Give or take a few days for farming if you didn't and you should end up near 28th. Plus since the daily gate is getting removed down to 2h cd, and the feeding from 4 to 3 days, I can see the skins being a tease for others to finally go for them since they patched it? Idk, we could atleast have them leaked in the patch but due to release the week after so 7th of June.
---
There is no real wisely, it is all accountbound and there for you can not sell it. How ever with dye you might want to check out shadow abyss which is the most expensive black dye to buy and also the most black one. There are other dyes that cost a lot to buy that you might want to get and can get now without paying for it. Again you can not sell them but you get them for free.
---
This wiki page https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift will show you what each of them contain. Check what dye box you have and check out all the dyes in it and see what you like and what cost the most and get those first.
---
I wasnt, but now I did...
---
one i wouldn't mind a skin for is Kuunavang
---
and people who do solo/speed clears are "toxic elitists"
---
It should unlock hide and seek with Gorrik and the entire thing is really awkward
---
"Gorrik, why are you bringing the ball back in your mouth?"
---
- Size has nothing to do with awakening order; The order was Primordus -&gt; DSD/Jormag -&gt; Zhaitan -&gt; Kralk -&gt; Mordremoth
---
- Dragons normally awaken when they run out of magic, not when it receive it - It's a cycle of waking up, consuming the world's magic, going to sleep, leaking out magic, rinse and repeat. Mordremoth was the only ED seen to wake from an influx or magic, when Scarlet disrupted the leylines and jolted him awake
---
- After waking, they go through a period of intense activity (e.g. flooding Destroyers into the Depths, pushing Krait out of the deep ocean, freezing the Far Shiverpeaks, raising Orr, branding from Ascalon to Crystal Desert, sending vines across Tyria), before settling down somewhat and sticking to location, occasionally becoming more active again.
---
- Primordus wasn't asleep when Balthazar drained his magic, he has been awake since 1120 AE (212 years). He had only just moved from the Shiverpeaks to the fire islands ~8 months prior.
---
&gt; Did aurene actually absorbed all the dragon energy when it fall?
---
That seems to be the case, but we won't know for sure until LS5.
---
&gt; Who is the next dragon after kralkatorric in size comparison that was able to absorb the energy and awake?
---
All of the Elder Dragons are awake, Mordremoth was the last to awaken.
---
&gt; you thing the sea dragon is the next to awake ?
---
DSD woke up either second or third, it's very likely going to become more active now though considering we just dropped an Elder Dragon corpse in its domain and disrupted the leylines there.
---
&gt; People on internet say that the sea dragon is the biggest one
---
It's all theories at this point, we have absolutely no clue how big the DSD is. The only other elder dragon without a model is Jormag but there is some old artwork of him in the Norn intro cinematic.
---
&gt;  he controls the sea, all that area is so huge, probably he has the biggest Leyline energy banquet of all!
---
*Maybe*. The world of Tyria is [**huge**](http://i.imgur.com/R40p6.jpg), yet all 6 elder dragons are sitting around one small part of the central continent. It's very likely that this is because this part of the world has a high concentration of leylines, with Lion's Arch and Tanged Depths both sitting on confluences, and that areas further away have fewer/none (such as Elona, the ocean)... But we'll need to wait and see.
---
I hated scarlet, she was the type of old school villain type 
---
‚Äú you‚Äôll never catch me nea nea nea nea nea‚Äù
---
Im glad they moved away from that.
---
To the split second removed comment: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release

Thank you! Yeah sorry lol I felt kinda rude with how i worded that comment, combined with people downvoting the post, I thought i better not make a comment like that. 
---
Thank you though! :)
---
If you play with M+K you can just left click on the target you want to hit. If you play with action camera you'll get a tiny dot in the mid of your screen and that's where you're aiming at. If you enable autotargetting, you automatically target things in that cross, that are in range for your skills. If you disable autotargetting you will be unable to use targetted skills, if you don't manually click on an enemy to target it. You will be able to swing melee attacks freely and to aim ranged attacks like in a shooter game.
---
hopefully primeval skin, i have it for all mounts that gets that skin
---
Alright, thanks for clarifying!
---
Fashion wars, storage space, being able to quickly swap builds without using arcDPS and without cluttering your inventory with alternate sets of gear.
---
Weren't griffon skins released early, not all players even got to that part of PoF story to even start unlocking it? Or were stuck due to gold requirement?
---
Hey! I feel attacked. I run with that armor. I like it. I swapped the helmet with goggles but I think it looks dope.

I often only end up doing 2 dailies, missing out on the rewards but atleast i got some spirit shards and some mats i guess
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you want the Aurora trinket which is legendary trinket with pretty cool effects then you need all season 3. If you want the Sky Scale mount then whole season 4. Reason for this is that the collections are spread out over all chpaters. 
---
Also the roller beatle you gonna need parts of season 4.
---
She also has a very similar head shape to Kralk
---
Oh ok thanks (-: I understood OP was able to reach the main area.
---
If Mordremoth can attack the Mother Tree in Australia, it can attack anyhwere!
---
As written in the description, it's about specialization collections. Every PoF specialization collection. ;-)
---
&gt;Why does every MMO do this then? You do realize there is a reason it is done. To make the game live longer.
---
Yeah, you missed my point, the point was: timegates are a lazy way to prolong the life of your content, there is more entertaining ways to have players do the content multiple times
---
&gt;For raid rewards especially it's important to not devalue them.
---
Compared to what ? If we're speaking about gold costs, it is currently faster to do ls3 for all your trinkets needs, and armor drops are more frequent in fractals (12 chests a day vs 20 chests a week) so it's only about skins, which aren't sellable so this isn't money related.
---
If it's about exclusivity, then yes, you can preserve exclusivity in a number of ways, including putting a 1 chest per week limit on the drop, putting a 0.001 drop rate, requiring stacks and stacks of farmable currencies, or even better, throw all of these at once. Because that sounds like fun, am I right ?
---
&gt;Funnier yet I am going to be a game dev, not that I would ever be part of making MMOs so this isn't really an issue I'll face ever.
---
Weird flex but ok, I am sure you'll get a job in no time in the mobile industry, I feel like you've got the same kind of reasoning as they do, have fun !
---
Tbh it looked like he succed them so hard they have to go into low-maint mode to recover. But considering they're elder dragons that could take a very long time. I assume they just wanted to get rid of them since the whole elder dragons killing plotline was getting stale and they had to do something now that they've made it so we can't kill them.
---
&gt; Elder dragons are awakening in order, this order is based on their size for what I have learned, from comments based on game dialogues.
---
We only have seen a few elder Dragons in "flesh", Zhaitan and Kralkatorrik and with Primordus only his head. We don't know the actual size of Mordremoth because we only have seen him in his mind and we haven't lied eyes on either Jormag or Steve/bubbles. According of [the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon) and [the timeline](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Timeline) the order of awakening was
---
* Primordus 1120 AE
---
* Jormag 1165 AE
---
* Zhaitan 1219 AE
---
* Kralkatorrik 1320 AE
---
* Mordremoth 1327 AE
---
* Steve/Bubbles ?
---
Zhaitan was probably the smallest of them all so they didn't awaken based on their size but rather their hunger for magic which could either be that they have an "empty stomach" or that the balance between their own and the magic running through ley-lines is different.
---
&gt; It explains that when 1 falls tremendous amount of Leyline energy is released, and that energy is absorbed by the older dragons.
---
The connection you draw doesn't explain anything really. The elder dragons are balancing the magic in Tyria, they wake up if the magic in the world is high and go to sleep when it is not. Their body will emit the magic again which then flows through the ley-lines through the world. They absorb the magic because that is what they do, probably just a trait of being an elder dragon or, since every dragon has some form of magic spectrum, this needs to be split to other elder dragons.
---
&gt; The bigger the dragon, the bigger the amount of energy this one need to absorb to awake, that's why zaitan was the first. He was the smallest elder dragon.
---
No, We deprived Zhaitan from his energy source because we killed his eyes, mouth and other supply chains that starved him from magic. There was also no real indication that any magic has flown to other elder dragons. Evidently Mordremoth woke up because Scarlet disrupted the Ley line hub below Lions arch.
---
&gt; If one dies and it's energy is absorbed, their powers also are " learned " from their absorbed magic. Dragons now have zaitan's and mordemoth powers.
---
I think somewhere in Season 3 it is stated that magic operates on different parts of a spectrum, like light. So you have death magic, fire magic and other forms of magic that all are part of one all encompassing form of magic. If an elder dragon dies the magic gets split up, probably in unequal parts, to other elder dragons but not every elder dragon might be able to use every others elder dragons type of magic. In season 3 we try to kill Primordus and Jormag by using their opposite magic against each other and it hurt them.
---
&gt; Primordius was sleeping when Balthazar absorbed it's energy, later we know that kralkatorric absorbed Balthazar.
---
Primordus was awake in 1120 AE and he was even active in Season 3. Balthazar was not absorbed but rather his magic he got from the bloodstone explosion and the magic he siphoned from Primordus and Jormag through the machine we had to destroy.
---
&gt; My questions are, did aurene actually absorbed all the dragon energy when it fall? or is the amount of energy released so vast that she can't absorb it all for herself?
---
Good question. As we could see with the progression and evolution of Aurene she hatched with magic from at least Mordremoth (we don't actually know if she got Zhaitans magic, but it is likely), after the death of Balthazar she absorbed some of the magic and grew older. At the end of War eternal it looked like she grew to the full size of an elder dragon which could mean she absorbed all of the magic of Kralkatorrik because she maybe was the closest to the source.
---
I loved how this whole thing looked. I definitely took a screenshot to use as a background. Letterboxing is unfortuante but damn it still looks good.

Yeah

This is what happens when you spend too long in the desert.

Dr. Strange would like to have a word about battling in robes

Yes you can send the support a ticket and they will most of the time change your guild name and tag :)

So much hassle for an unban? Sounds like game companies are real nazi's to deal with when your unfairly banned :/
---
GW2 had the most depth i ever seen in a game. But then again i am the sort of person who speak to the npc all over the map and listen to every event and see what it is about and connect the dots and how it all ties together on the map but also towards what is going on in the world. 
---
More often then not you find shrines, papers, bodies, animals, books, lost kids, other npc, graves well interactable items every were. Nothing points to it you simply need to be curious enough to find it and read what is going on.
---
A lot of people miss this part and there for miss the depth it actaully do have.
---
i'm gonna add a few things
---
1. EDs are awoken by surges of magic, the current cycle was started by abbadon's death.
---
2. we don't know where DSD is except in the ocean and if you look at a map of tyria (the planet, not the continent), that's pretty big so dropping kralk at sailing distance of the shore might not affect him at all, it's just a popular theory
---
If the players are treated this way, i dont really see the point in playing the game.
---
First time I saw the login button guys omg!!!
---
thanks for the info, im most definitely one of those people climbing up the wall lol
---
Tried installing d912pxy, one extracted the zip file into the same folder as Gw2-64. I opened the folder and installed it normally. I do not see the  d912pxy/log.txt file after launching the game and there are a few issues, first one being character portraits at the character screen, the portraits are empty except for the character's eyes. Also textures are missing or become blue when in game. Can't seem to figure out the problem.
---
The skyscale is a hybrid of the griffon and springer that's inferior to both. The griffon and the springer on their own already break every single map and make world completion a piece of cake. The skyscale's flight is less than impressive and doesn't accomplish anything you couldn't already do with existing mounts.
---
A griffon, a springer and a leap of faith accomplish everything the skyscale can and far, FAR more.
---
The only reason people THINK its useful is that the new map is intentionally designed to play to the skyscale's strength and play to all the other mount's weaknesses, i.e.:
---
* Lots of branches to hinder griffon pullups making hard to dive and gain speed or maintain altitude. Meanwhile, skyscale can hover and use the branches to refresh the flight juice.
---
* Ledges that are juuuuust outside springer's reach, but not outside skyscale's reach.
---
* Vertical ledges stacked directly ontop of one another meaning that despite springer being able to jump that high, he can't access them because he bumps his head, while skyscale can just fly around and get on them. 
---
* Multiple large cliffs that are too close to one another for the griffon to dive and pull up, too far away for springer to jump accross, but just perfect the skyscale to climb.
---
The new map is deceptive when it comes to the scale's efficiency. No other map is designed with its specifications in mind, meaning the other mounts outdo it everywhere else.
---
The skyscale NEEDS the map to be built around it. The other mounts don't.
---
It needs to have its flight time doubled if not tripled (alongside its speed) to be even remotely worth it. Dashes shouldn't drain flight juice and you should keep their momentum. Also, the "red bar" shouldn't even exist. The green bar is enough of a limitaton.
---
Yeah it will make springer slightly less desirable, but considering that its behind a multiple day timegate assuming you blaze through everything, and requires ALL of season 4 AND sends you on a tyria wide scavenger hunt, while costing 140g in charged quartz alone then you might as well actually make it worth it.
---
Besides, the springer still has its uses with the dismount hop tech and ascends faster than the skyscale so even then it won't be completely useless.
---
Compare it to something like the Griffon, which is the second hardest mount to get (with a similar collection) and the other flying mount:
---
The skyscale is just a slightly more potent springer. The griffon completely revolutionises map exploration and travel.
---
It is the fastest way to travel in the game, and after you get the aerial finesse mastery it can maintain level flight forever WHILE flying accross the map at rocket speeds, something not even the skyscale can do.
---
If you find a high enough point to launch off, the griffon can take you anywhere else on the map regardless of map size in under 30 seconds.
---
Griffon is also the epitomy of the "Joy of movement" that the mounts are going for, once you learn to how use it to do tricks and pullups its just cathartic to fly around structures do dives and swirl around mountains at high speeds.
---
Meanwhile, the skyscale is just a sluggish elevator.
---

I once did skritt math on how much my family spent on smoking since they started smoking. Well i have to say, we could have lived in a pretty big house by now.
---
Second job? How is saving money a second job? The most you might have to do is to avoid doing somethings you enjoy because you want to save those money that cost. The work you do anyway, just as in game you will play it anyway. The plan ahead is something everybody should do always.
---
10 seconds? What class are you playing, and what build?
---
Looks like a Napoleon Dynamite drew that.
---
We did not "all" know though. Please do not assume everyone is hardcore and plays and knows everything about the game. I knew literally nothing about the Aurora legendary before this sky scale saddle and everyone talking about it. I've been pretty out of loop on the game and from what I've seen there are a lot of returning players that likely have the same lack of knowledge. Having to now collect a stack of each currency from almost 0 is honestly grindy and legitimately the LEAST fun I have ever had playing GW2. I'm not exaggerating either. I honestly hate it, and I fucking love this game. After 2 days of several hours of play I still only have about 50 of each currency. 100 of the kralk ore.
---
There is also a conveniently placed Speed Boost Mushroom nearby which you can use to gain extra speed. Other than that it really helped me to quickly reposition in the center for higher chances to reach any point. Granted, it still took about 10 tries to get it.
---
On certain mouse like mine : Scimitar Corsair, you can move the entire side 12 button panel. So the entire panel can slide.  
---
Even with that, when it comes to use the last ones, 10, 11, 12 , I use the internal tendon of my thumb.
---
In my case, almost 2 years. I took a break until end of 2017, returned. Joined the raiding scene and raided for more than a year, got all my legendary armors and whatnot. Now back to an extensive break of almost half a year again XD
---
kinda reminds me of Rogue T2 with the collor sheme and the shoulders slightly ;D
---
All the mysterious downvotes are interesting
---
10 seconds was even on the low side of what I was thinking. I'm a ranger and I'm still just level 69, but over the past few days all these mobs really got to me man. They die too slowly.
---
News flash: skyscale isn‚Äôt mandatory. Don‚Äôt get if you don‚Äôt wanna grind
---
Take into account that all high levels scale down to low levels everywhere. So it isn't too big of a deal if one of you outlvls the others you can still play together
---
Tbf, it would be dope if there was a glowing akatosh skin for skyscale
---
Iirc it wasn't so much that there was a disruption but that she blocked the flow of some leylines which forced their magic down another path straight to Mordy.
---
Well you can't play them in GW2 cuz I'm fairly certain anet already adressed why those classes don't exist, paragons becoming guardians for example
---
Nice notions but honestly it would break the game, it's simply designed around weapon skills and specs as opposed to merging classes.   
---
Adding this would seem a bit redundant and cause a lot of issues
---
Your character appears in it. How can it be pre rendered?
---
What nonsense? Scarlet is the Season 1 villain, and Thaumanova reactor fractal takes a part from the first living story as well. That dialogue was the end from season 1 last cinematic. You clearly never did Season 1 which makes the meme funnier.
---
I switched from the g600 (because of broken Buttons) to the corsair scimitar pro, because of the adjustable thumb panel.
---
The Software is a real pain but the mouse itself has a nice handling.
---
Flying mounts always break games that weren't created speciffily with those in mind!
---
No, it never is, and especially with such a different origin.
---
that is valuable information and a beautiful hydra drawing!
---
From d912pxy reddit post: 
---
How i see it installed correctly and works?
---
‚ÄãBy default you should see bugged character portraits in character selection screen.
---
Aight, thanks.
---
You are far past standard edginess
---
It's a shame because while I played some of LW1, I didn't even know the Attack on LA was going on in the game world until it was over. Not only did I not even know it was going on and missed it by default, if I remember correctly at the time I was stuck in some major work stuff for a few months, I would have never had the time to check it out anyway. That's why I'm not a fan of timed content. I get that it improves depth of immersion, but there are ways to give people a "wayback machine" type experience and keep the content around, it didn't need to be removed from the game entirely.
---
This is pretty big for people wanting to try vipers I recon
---
by layering the video behind the character or having transparent sections in it. if you ever heard of green screens, what makes you think something similar isn't possible in a fully digital environment?
---
I still have one of the chests from one of the few times our server beat it. I figured having it is worth more to me than the junk contained within.
---
This is what my brother said. Then it can become a world boss.
---
And how many times have they actually done that in GW2...
---
The stunts some of you guys go for trying to discredit others are amazing.
---
This argument is TERRIBLE. Not every player went for Aurora, not every player CARES about legendary trinkets and would otherwise ignore it if it were to be released. A mediocre glorified dragon mount is NOT the same as a legendary elite item. I don‚Äôt understand how this is even an argument to begin with, I never went for Aurora because I don‚Äôt care for legendary trinkets, I never needed to grind 250 of each currency. The skyscale is NOT a legendary trinket so stop treating it like one.
---
Corsair called, they want their RGB back
---
Hello, and welcome to sarcasm! I admit that that often is not transmitted well in text.
---
I am fully aware of the context surrounding Thaumanova and Scarlet. My comment was highlighting the fact that many players would *only* know her from that fractal, and then only if they paid attention to the ambient dialogue. 
---
For reference, "/s" is often used at the end of a text post to indicated sarcasm, or that the post is not to be taken literally.
---
People accumulate fortune over time here by doing certain things on a daily basis. Here is a simple little way you can do.   
---
Do your daily (it gives you 2 gold and is very ez), then do fractal dailies for as high as your agony allows. So if you only have 50 agony resistance just do the t1 dailies. This is doing 5 dungeons I think, very ez to find a grp and go out to Dragonfall and participate in at least 1 meta.   
---
On Dragonfall, apart from all the sheer loot you get you will be getting a lot of ancient magic and mistborne thingies (can be crushed into magic). You take those (and a bit of gold) and buy crates with specific loot in them at the vendor. So by wasting like 1g and some magic you will be getting 2-3g (don't know the actual values, just an example).   
---
So not only will you be swimming in gear by the time a meta is done you'll have even more to get via the ancient magics.   
---
You can later step it up and buy the karmic retribution bonues which allow you to farm karma in that zone like mad and then you can transfer that karma into currency via some means (or just have it handy for a legendary you might wanna get some day).   
---
When I was farming gold for the last gift of my legendary I ran Istan meta all day, Dragonfall is profitable as Istan once was thus very popular and a lot of groups and commanders.
---
A legendary item is not the same as a mount. No matter how ‚Äúprestige‚Äù you‚Äôd like to call it. Arenanet KNOWS that only a small percentage actually care about legendary trinkets, they also know that literally everyone playing the game will want a flying dragon mount. They are not the same, at all.
---
Why exactly should it be worse in others? The concept of "all mounts should be good at something" doesn't quite cut it. IT TAKES SO LONG to get it and so much off your pockets and patience. I don't want to invest so much of the time I don't really have into a slightly better Springer.
---
Yes it should be superior to some other mounts. Not a midterm kinda good at flying kinda good at climbing bs that is only really usefull on **ONE** fking map and sucks on the rest.
---
Don't @ me saying you can climb that stupid tree in 7 minutes bullshit like some ppl said cause that's not nearly enough.
---
Someone please correct me on this if I'm wrong because I don't really play with these settings much, but as far as I know, the only way to target something by simply attacking it is to have auto targeting on. Any other method requires manual targeting of some kind.
---
I have auto targeting on, which means that it targets whatever I attack in front of me, and promote skill target, which means that once it has targeted something, it won't target anything else regardless of where I attack. If I need auto targeting off for some reason, I have a toggle that turns it on and off on the fly.
---
This is a beautiful rendition of hydra and I would welcome a full album of all the bosses.
---
There is no gear score in guild wars 2. If you want to gear properly, I would look up a build on metabattle for the format you like. Then, get exotic level 80 gear for that build.
---
That's a cool idea. That could be how races are implemented for the Skyscale.
---
Looking real dapper there üëå I love their coat!
---
Thank you!
---
I have not played Anthem of Div2 so may not be the right person to comment.. But.
---
Gw2 has a lot of different options that can sustain your interest for easily 1000+ hours of play.
---
1. PvE story (Core, HoT, PoF) 
---
2. Living Seasons (*These are episodes that gets released between expansions, and these needs to be purchased separately. If you have logged into the game when they got released, u get to play them for free. If not, you need to buy. These you can be bought using in-game currency as well. Not easy but not impossible too) 
---
3. World completion, and PvE events, Meta events 
---
4. Mastery completion 
---
5. Getting all mounts 
---
6. Fashion wars
---
7. Role Play
---
8.Dungeons
---
9. Fractals
---
10. Raids
---
11. PvP
---
12. World vs Wolrd
---
13. Repeat on 9 totally different classes.
---
We should have a whole cr√®che of adorable babby skyscales scurrying around :3
---
Focus Dagger for life! Looks cool
---
that‚Äôs the one thing people can‚Äôt seem to get into their heads with this whole situation. It‚Äôs not necessary or mandatory to get and mostly just for wish fulfillment ( Anet themselves said they wanted a dragon mount first and then thought about movement ) 
---
The fact that it even has a slight niche where it‚Äôs better to use over other mounts is impressive.
---
Dat air time
---
i can't give you definitive examples as i don't know how the painterly looking scenes we often got in the past were actually handled (e.g. core intro, dialoge, and epilogue scenes), but i can link you to these two tweets in regards to the current episode:

you questioned the very possibility and i gave you an answer. no reason  to feel offended.
---
Estinien I know that's you.
---
As others have said, the bugged character portraits are how you know it's working. The missing textures need a while to load. If this problem persists after a few hours of playing and loading into new zones, then you should start trouble shooting. Run around in busy areas, you should notice a bump in your frame rate. If you are noticing no change, or even worse frame rate, then your system isn't powerful enough to take advantage of d912pxy.
---
Nope, you probably just rode around a skyscale too much.
---
Dang! That‚Äôs cool!
---
If I had to guess, It's two scythes forming both the circular area of a Shade and a "No entry"  sign (üö´), to signify how shades are a deterrent that keeps enemies away from them.
---
Also: ppl buy second and third account etc just for daily log in rewards. There is another post up where someone has calculated the gold he lost by not logging in daily. Definitely worth is.
---
I kinda wish charr stood more upright, would be cool for the scholar professions especially.
---
Didn't see you help OP either so thanks for proving my point further.
---
Much better. Op's image looks kind of like a demon in diapers.
---
This is the only helmet I've ever wanted... I just can't get the hang of raids. Char looks awesome, I personally like it all dyed black if you're going for that bamf edgelord theme.
---
I got bandaids, I just dropped them on the floor for you to step on.
---
Fair point
---
I think you are mistaken. Kangaroos agree on Austria not Australia.
---
Soulbeast! I started this game 6 years ago as a Ranger main, and when I came back last year, I immediately fell in love with the soulbeast spec. I love finding and naming pets, I love always having a companion no matter where I am, I love that I can stretch the burst to better sustain in OW, I love the movement built into power and how quickly condi stacks bleeding, I love that I can switch between the two with ease (using arcdps build templates until the official ones are out) and how both options feel unique enough to keep gameplay fresh but related enough that I can switch without any trouble, I love that the main builds are so stable that they're rarely affected by game updates (PvP is unbalanced but OW is solid af), I love that it wears my favorite armor weight, and that it blends so well thematically with my beloved norns.  
---
Any class can be rewarding and interesting for the people who fit it and love it, and for me that class is soulbeast. Around 75% of my account's playtime is on soulbeast/ranger, and that's only going to skew more when I add a third one lol
---
I mean in a way it's "lazy" for sure, but you have to realize there is such a thing as limit to how much content you can produce. It is maybe "lazy" compared to simply making more, but since there is not a possibility of making more due to costs and time limitations, making a game live longer in an arbitrary way is good for it. You actually give the exact reason why weekly limit is the good option, otherwise rewards would need to be so low drop rate that you'd need to farm it a lot, and simply farming it until you get is a lot more fun than doing it once a week right? Statistics show otherwise.
---
Now you clearly don't understand that MMOs \_need\_ some sort of incentive to keep players interested or they die. Weekly and daily limits are a thing in literally every single MMO for a reason, wouldn't you think someone would make a game that is simply fun and enjoyable without any kinds of limitations if there wasn't a reason to have them?
---
season 1 is missing, all other content is available for sale in the gemstore and xpac (or for free if you log in before the next episode release)
---
also i don't think world quests were ever a thing (are you sure it's not called something else?)
---
Honestly? Never played Chrono until i started raiding. Got hooked on playing Mesmer, and now I'm playing it eeeeverywhere. You can tank, pDPS, cDPS, and huuuuuge utility
---
You can just do like everything with a mesmer, I love it so much tbh.
---
Core Tyria hasn't seen its maps changed since season 1 (and it was minor), except for a few insignificant events.
---
Season 2 occurs in dedicated instances.
---
HoT/S3/PoF/S4 all have their own maps.
---
So the only real hole in the story you can get, if you don't boost and rush to these specific zones, will be season 1 (and you are proposed a short summary from an NPC after finishing core story).
---
Each map is placed in a separate timeline. So yeah going to a map that is happening later might have spoilers.
---
It didn't bother me, but if your main focus is story then better do that in the first place and only after that get on with the exploration.
---
Dynamic events or meta events, and yes they are still a part of the game that people participate in.  Some more than others depending on reward.
---
I wondered about it, too. So I played the story again a few weeks ago. 
---
I think the key point is that Taimi (and her scanner) said "Energy" and not "Magic". 
---
Balhazar used Taimis machine not only to suck Primordus' and Jormag's magic, he also used them against each other (on purpose or not), so they weakened each other while he sucked their magic. 
---
In other words they hurt each other *and* lost much magic. Both could be a good reason to go back to sleep. They need to heal their wounds and they need to get their magic back. 
---
We know that the (almost) only thing Elder Dragons do, when they are awake, is to create minions and let them gather magic for them. And since Primordus and Jormag already created a lot of minions, they are able to go back to sleep again *and* to still get magic from their minions.
---
Because of both, healing and still getting magic form their minions, I think this sleep is different from their natural cycle. And I think this could be a reason to have to deal with them anytime later.
---
[...](https://images.app.goo.gl/TdAPGrBeiZn83xhs9)
---
Events are still all over the place, they are a core feature of the game.
---
Legendary crafting ensures there will be often people trying to fight World Bosses, a type of event in which many players fight a powerful boss.
---
Both has its purposes,
---
Let say Griffon is an F-14 Hornet. 
---
Then your Skyscale would be your Apache.
---
example, try getting all the floating Volatile Magic in Thunderhead Keep. Its a nightmare using a Griffon. 100% using Skyscale.
---
Some people seem to think that we will never go back to primordus or jormag, but I really hope we do. I know this is probably a pretty unpopular opinion, but I really liked the "old" idea of the elder dragons during the vanilla of this game. Killing off each one (maybe via expansion where we visit a new area of tyria to do it, like HoT) was a cool idea to me. I see why they're going the direction they are now, but I got really into the story of the norn and spirits and jormag from the early game and books. There was mystery there that kind of got dropped, like how owl got consumed, what happened to the missing spirits, what happened to female norn that got taken by the icebrood. I know now the female norn thing seems to just be "well they are killed and that's all there is to it" but I remember with the books it was a bit more mysterious. 
---
and then there's pretty much everything with primordus. We got his model and it was pretty cool, and I'm sure there's a lot more we could do with the asura having been pushed from underground and maybe the chak and whatnot. I just feel like these two dragons still really had a story to tell.
---
But nobody addressed you directly, your just complaining for people to talk differently because you don't like it?   
---
Sorry for what happened to you but this is entirely a you problem if you feel compelled to do this, you should be getting therapy so you can move on instead of getting angry at people who have 0 ill-intent and you are fully aware of that.
---
The races are very *Planet of Hats* so the entire experience up to becoming an order neophyte is very "I'm Norn y'all, and I'm Norn y'all. And I'm Nornity Norn and I'm Norn y'all."
---
Bloodstone Fen is always going to have players playing because of the pseudo-legendary status of the stuff you get there.
---
they are called [Dynamic Events](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_event)
---
they're not turning it around into something good. they're saying "I'm not affected by it, so that makes it ok for me to use it to kick down those who are". the context is that the word is still strongly associated with violence, and people who haven't experienced that violence are telling those who have that the problem will just go away if they just cooperate with their attackers.
---
it's like cis gay men inviting cops to pride while trans women are still being murdered.
---
Yea I like the vault, I also like the one behind the tengu gates in LA and then there‚Äôs the caledon forest unfinished jp I like to bust into
---
You're so edgy you touched yourself during the first episode of *Goblin Slayer*.
---
Too edgy? I don't know do you have a tragic backstory to go with all that black?
---
Ya made a good race choice, sir. Lovely art.
---
sell your mats on the TP, not the vendors (alot of people selling their stuff to the vendors, so I had the feeling I had to point this out)
---
Legs are the new etherbound greaves. Not sure what the chest is, though.
---
Why? Do you hate free money? Half the time, they can be done in about 5 mins for 2 gold.
---
They're a content guide. You can a minute of harvesting, a vista and cheat a jumping puzzle for two gold, or you can *do* a jumping puzzle, a bounty, an adventure or follow a meta along for the events.
---
Woah, thanks for the informative post!
---
I have no ideas that the episodes are actual dlcs content.
---
Nice to know that the game will be continuing for the forseenable future. &gt;.&lt; Thinking of buying the 99usd package w/ both expac n gems , is that a good deal? or I should just get the twin pack n purchase gems seperately?
---
=D nice and short reply.  Thanks
---
yea, too bad about the missed promo. &gt;.&lt;
---
factually incorrect and yikes
---
you just addressed me directly. everyone replying to my comments is addressing me directly. fuck off with that gaslighting shit.
---
=D Yea. Was wondering about which expansion might be more worth it. Been liking the game so far, but was qutie hesistant in plowing more cash in as it is a old game and i'm worried that some content might be outdated or superseeded by the new PoF expansion.
---
That posture and whole character looks waaaaay better than actual light armor charr :)
---
Great art
---
Indeed, I started playing the Ranger as main. Still using that to clear the LW story, but when it comes to open world (farming and roaming), the Mesmer is the best.
---
Silverwastes. If you open the bags at a lvl.51 character, you get around 20g/h, if you do the RIBA right.  
---
Sell stuff at the TP, not the vendor.
---
&gt; This wasn't though. At least not exclusively. It has to be considered to avoid unrealistic scenarios that couldn't be financed. But I was more focused on what would be fun in my opinion. 
---
  
---
Sure. Something that is "optimally fun" though is something that will encourage people to keep going for a decent amount of time by giving them an end goal to work towards but not be tediously long to the point where they get discouraged and quit.  
---
With the unlocking of mounts, you are not drip-fed any rewards, instead receiving all of your reward at the very end of the journey in the form of the mount. That means it's extra important to tailor the experience and not make it too long. Of course, it should also not be too short since that would mean everyone cheaply unlocks the mount right away, but then has no motivation to continue playing and so they stop. That's also a bad result.  
---
&gt; For all other mounts it depends how necessary they are to play the content. How much content is locked behind having the mount. The more there is, the lower the hurdle has to be. (And yes, (in)convenience of course also plays into this.) More optional mounts seem like a really good reward for long-term hurdles. 
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but of the 4 core mounts, content is locked behind 3 of them, with the manta ray being the unnecessary one (but in some cases is more convenient), no? There is technically content locked behind RB too. Content aside, each of the maps in PoF were clearly designed to be enjoyed by one or more of the mounts, not just raptor.  
---
I wouldn't mind there being a bit of work attached to unlocking each mount. Like had it been the case from PoF launch that you unlocked raptor and bunny fairly easily (which lock away the most content), but then the other two mounts had some tasks or an achievement you had to complete that involved story completion, yellow heart completion, and the map meta completion, I think I'd rather like that since it invests you with the lore and the land a bit more, but overall wouldn't take too long to complete, being on the time-scale of minutes to few hours + it's mostly self-contained within PoF content.   
---
On the other hand, if you had to unlock bunny, manta ray and doggo the same way you unlocked SS (time-gated behind 3-days of "raising" them from a baby/hatchling in addition to other checklist-based achievement stuff), that would be pretty awful and I don't think anyone would appreciate that.   
---
Point of the PoF mounts is to be able to unlock them and enjoy the bulk of content with them, not be artificially time-gated so you can earn them then back-track and do map completion. It's different with RB and SS since they aren't actually necessary. You can enjoy and conveniently play the content in their respective maps with one of the other mounts you've already unlocked.
---
depends if you want the gems. you can get both expansions on DLGamer for ~$38 and the 4000 gems are $50 but those are only standard editions which will not include the additional goodies.
---
dynamic events (or just events for short), they're still being done, yes
---
 (at least the mayor ones might be that there's a forgotten one in the furthest corner of a random map nobody remembers)
---
The balance nightmare was why they got rid of them for GW2. Honestly, part of me wants them to remove the elite spec trait line and just have elite specs be something that give you utilities/new mechanics. Imagine the possibilities that would be opened up if you lost all the traits but gained that third slot. It wouldn't powercreep the classes more because you would be losing the "+20% damage" style traits and instead would just get new utilities that would be used with your core traits.
---
The skyscale should be perfect for you, it can get nearly anywhere on any map if you put your mind to it, it excels at climbing and it's biggest downside is that is slow but if it isn't about being optimal for you then it is fine.
---
I don't mind the copying. What bothers me is that, after 2 years of PoF, they're not able to make a nice animation, when you walk (not run) with the gryff/warclaw/dwaggie and stop. It still makes this weird jump, instead of just stopping.
---
Marjory is helping Kas train with her phantasms, if you know what I mean. And you do.
---
Happened for me too. I didn't notice they were gone at first I just thought I randomly got some bonus gems. I was pretty hype till I realized what happened.
---
I did not said 11 chars a day, I said 1 build per day. Limiting berry farm would force me out to either spending WvW claim tickets instead of using it for another legendary set, either doing new map, either doing mix of sirens landing, Bloodstone fen, braindead season 4 heart farming, you name it. 
---
The point there is no reason nerfing convenient farm routes when there are 10 alternative farm routes. If someone likes to do alternative route it their will, and projecting your desire on other people just because you hate berry farm is stupid. I do not see how berry farm better to bloodstone fen for example (it was buffed reticently to pre-nerf levels), since it is still superior resetable trinkets, and you still need to get earring 2 somewhere else and ring 2 if you do fractals.
---
And I already have ascended trinkets on all 11 chars + alternative sets on some. I just hate when someone thinks that handicapping new players is a great experience, since that farm was in a game for 3 years. And unless you needed PoF stats and earring 2 + amulet it was the best farm as it would be after patch. I do not see improvement here. I see great improvement that now you would not need to do S4 maps. They are just bad for the most part, aside Istan and Dragonfall (for other reasons tho). I completed 3 Requiem armor sets several weeks ago and Skyscale yesterday and hope that I would never ever farm a SINGLE piece of mistonium.
---
happy cake day
---
I did the opposite-- made the tiniest norn possible, and insist she's a human adopted by the norn! So you might actually do better to make an enormous human, and just rp whatever you like. If it helps, the human story, whatever your choices, has you being raised by adopted parents, I'm pretty sure. Not that you SEE your parents, but still.
---
I saw that guy in VB, cutting down trees and opening airships cargos with 6 characters. It made me stop for a while.
---
Seriously dude?
---
Dailies are just a way of making the first 15 minutes of play time in a day more rewarding, thereby helping people who maybe can only play for a few minutes most days by letting those days contribute meaningfully to progress towards other goals, so they don't have to focus all their energy on the occasional binge session. 
---
That's it. They're not gating anything, they're just a bonus reward to level the playing field a little bit between people who can play a lot, and those who can't.
---
The legs, not the feet. Depends on the armour weight I guess.
---
Too edgy? Hmmm maybe not, but all your characters do have a mostly black armor thing going...you can be edgy with splashes of red too. My reaper is!
---
I agree that it can get anywhere. I just don't feel any joy in flying it being so slow and the dash feels weird and clunky. I don't want to hate but I had so many expectations for it. :(
---
I enjoyed it. Some parts were better than others, but overall it told a engaging story.  Reading the book Edge of Destiny really pulled the story together for me.  I've also played the personal on different races up to Claw Island, that's where they all start to merge.
---
The DPS benchmarks on those websites include a nearly full set of boons, and a full set of conditions on the golem. You can check the video for the exact details.
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
click "buffs" with the golem icon.
---
According to Braham we "put Jormag back to sleep" also, whether that is just in reference to what Taimi is also observing or did he see some other evidence of that during his time up north moping we do not know.
---
However, I do believe that we will not be actively going for either Primordus or Jormag any time soon... especially if the dev comment about not always having world ending stakes in the story is anything to go by.
---
Besides we only have one surrogate elder dragon in Aurene, and I doubt she can stand in for all of them without some additional developments (what those would be I have no clue) certainly the characters seem to be unsure what is going on with her even after absorbing one souped up (Zhaitan and Mordy influence) elder dragon + fallen god.
---
So the most likely prediction is they would like to focus on something completely different for the majority of S5, and whatever comes after that is anyone's guess at this point.
---
3 - 4 minute long clips have been recently getting recommended to me on youtube of the earlier seasons and it made me remember a time when i was actually excited for the next new episode. i didnt realise how far GoT had fallen because it's been so long since i saw the good seasons.
---
There is one heart in the south where you simply throw branded crystals at dummies. Do it on each character and then repeat at reset. I get 80 every reset.
---
But how much would you say is good dps?
---
So, he will be the next character walking around in a loin cloth for years. ;P
---
Maybe a pinsir tbh
---
Remember that you can do the hearts daily with different characters, map completion gives 25 of the currency for the last 3 maps, and PvP/WvW tracks give 50 of the currency except for istan, which gives 250.
---
It's hard to remember at times, because Arena Net does a shit job of ever reminding us, but something worth acknowledging is Braham was *literally* an angsty teenager both when we first met him and throughout season 3.
---
He's less than twenty years old for the majority of S1 to S3. I can't find the exact instance where his original age was stated but holy moly does it recontextualize his edgelordiness - if only a little bit.
---
That's brilliant !   =)
---
Well we were going to help but Shadow stopped us a little. Then in HoTs we were Commando. And now. We just say a word and pact comes runing like loyal lap dog.
---
I enjoyed the parts that related to my character‚Äôs race and choices during character creation. I found that to be pretty fun. I really wish we could replay that part of the personal story actually. 
---
But the story telling has been much better and more engaging during and since HoT, in my opinion.
---
:o imma go find this
---
Second Smart Asura? Like Gorrik and Blish?
---
This is probably the wordiest way to say "Woosh." I've ever read.
---
Female Asura VA still have sass in her voice best hero VA in my opinion.
---
I've already used the treat on it, still, to repeat what I said in the main post: I'd very much like the 5 ap from the separate achievement for killing the anomaly.
---
Power dps is always berserker, with some assassins to crit cap. Berserkers and assassins are both core so you‚Äôre in luck. Just buy exotics from the tp or even buy from dungeons if you‚Äôd like. Just follow the [snowcrows build and rotations](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/) very closely for the best results. As you can see, dh is hella awesome because traits give lots of crit chance, so you don‚Äôt need a single assassins piece, just full berserkers with gs + scepter/focus. Exotics are fine for raids, but if you want ascended, start those daily crafts now, then do a [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator) crafting goodness to make a ascended set for cheap. For accessories, fractal ones, raid ones, guild commendation ones, laurel ones, idk they‚Äôll all have it. Backpiece just do the fractal precursor one or some other collection one. The most expensive, and kinda unavoidable purchase will be superior scholar runes. They‚Äôre expensive, 38 gold per set or something. You could go thief runes or some other alternative, but if you want to be serious about raiding, you should invest in scholar runes.
---
The story is great. Especially when you look at it as a whole, rather than the individual path of a single character.
---
\^This.   
---
That's why I haven't bought any Warclaw skins. It was pure lazy work that pack of skins. Hope it wouldn't be like that for the Skyscale.  
---
I only disagree in mount skins being game rewards -- I mean, I would love to, spare me some money, but Anet needs the micro-transactions involved.
---
do I get the living seasons up until now when buyng the expansions now?
---
Or do I need to buy those seperately for the last 7 years? o_o
---
Plus as Sylvari you bond with Canach watching each other back all the time.
---
Thanks for the confirmation! :)
---
Nice summary, but to correct a statement, we do know Mordremoth‚Äôs actual size: he was basically the entire Maguuma Jungle, all those huge vines we see on the HoT maps and in Silverwastes are his body. We have also fought his head directly, his ‚Äútrue‚Äù physical manifestation. It‚Äôs kind of interesting how still so many players think that was only a champion, when it was Mordremoth himself (which is confirmed in PoF as well).
---
In One Path ends this is what Braham sent to Taimi
---
&gt; "Destiny's Edge‚Äîmy guild‚Äîhad it surrounded, and then... Suddenly, an anguished roar, and it returned to the ice." 
---
followed by Taimi referring to Jormag as "snoozy"
---
Then in The First City he says we put Jormag to sleep under a mountain of ice, but as you mentioned he could just be following what Taimi said.
---
We probably won't deal with the dragons anytime soon (rip people who play norn and care about their lore), but I think they are still potential threats that will need handled at some point. While I am in no rush myself to continue chasing dragon after dragon after dragon after dragon, I really hope they don't get handwaved off screen with some kind of "Aurene did something now all is well when it comes to dragons"
---
There's a fox you can play with in the Sun's Refuge already, so it's very doable.
---
A succubus. It's name is a succubus. ;-)
---
You will not reach even close to benchmark on the raid golem with this build. This build requires more critchance that you get from Fractal Pot to use Perfect Inscriptions instead of Righteous Insticts.
---
Please before playing any build read what your traits/skills actually do.
---
Finish what you began few years ago (personnal story). Finish world completion. Then buy, and play, in order, LW and HoT/PoF.
---
Take your time. And enjoy.
---
That what i did, and i did achievement then. I'm just finishing them 1year and half later. 
---
Not rushing to mounts was the best choice i made.
---
The only really lasting evidence of your story choices (aside from your chosen order) will be the NPCs that end up in your home instance, which you can preview here:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unlockable\_home\_instance\_characters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unlockable_home_instance_characters). Most people I know outright ignore their personal stories or draw only vague inspiration and just play around that.
---
It‚Äôs not a contradiction as I‚Äôm saying that I don‚Äôt actively play those game modes. Especially not the way they are intended
---
Every time I come back from a break I can't help but do the math (like I'm so familiar with the numbers my brain just does it for me whether I want it or not). It hurts more when you account for alt accounts too :(
---
At this point I don‚Äôt think you what grinding is.
---
There is no go to class for that situation. Pick what you like...
---
Stuff like thief, holo, warrior are not hard to gear and good just about everywhere.
---
It is Heavy Bladed Chest
---
The part before the 'Skyscale Saddle' was actually pretty fun to do. It was a little annoying discovering there was some timegating going on, but I didn't think it was that bad. 
---
But I'm now at the part where I'm grinding to get 250 of each map currency and at this point I want this thing to be over with. The grind to get 250 of each map currency is just not worth it in my opinion.   
---
Anet seems to expect us to farm the same map for 3-4 months untill the next one released not spending map currency to all kind of shiny things and now we get to start it all over again? This doesn't feel good or rewarding to me. 
---
When you are in the fase of feeding the mount you basicly login, feed it and you are done for the day. Maybe if at this point I knew about the map currency grind
---
There are some easy fixes for it though (in my opinion): 
---
* Change the 250 map currency to 'only' 100 (seeing how little some maps seem to pay out, this seems more then reasonable).
---
* Give the skyscale (as a mount) to the user before the saddle part and change the saddle part to give a skin instead. I think (at this poing) it would be nicer to grind for a skin. This way you would feel like you just received the big reward you are working toward. This grind wouldn't be that bad if there was optional skin for it (and as an extra bonus: it would be really nice for anet to give a mount a free skin in the game)
---
short: I already farmed the maps and spend its currency when it was new. I'm not looking forward to starting all that farming over again (especially seeing how rare some the map currency really is).
---
In GW1 they did make upright charr (the spellcasters from eye of the north): https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr_Avenger
---
Always thought they were cool!
---
Majestic af
---
This is exactly how I assume it works. Elder Dragons bleed all their magic out into the world while they are asleep (involuntarily). At some point during their slumber, they then notice that magic levels in Tyria are high again and wake up to feast once more. They are a little like lungfish in that regard, as they can (and will) hibernate when circumstances are not ideal for them (in this case, no magic left to consume), and will resume activity once circumstances get better.
---
I do. And I understand playing PvP isn't grinding *for you*, but not all people actually enjoy playing PvP and if they have to for the reward, that makes it grinding *for them*.
---
I didn't get a free one
---
Personal taste.
---
Fuck do I hope we do get one though. I know they never made a promise of it or anything but I still feel super let down that there isn't one. The Skyscale feels more like an ep6 thing than a wrap-up for all of S4.
---
Nice work! I love the outfit. I play a lot of elementalist, I‚Äôd recommend giving dual daggers a try sometime if you haven‚Äôt already, loads of fun. You can do some massive damage with Earth 5 if you combo it with damage enhancement abilities. Best of luck!
---
They have the map, or at least a version of it for the personal story instances (however, even that is something they didn't actually always have so someone dug it out of somewhere since it came later in an update).
---
What they don't seem to have is probably all the NPC and any hand placed props and scripts or related data for the open world version of the old map.
---
We know they used to have to place festival decorations etc. by hand every year back then, so that is what I am basing the above on. If they have access to old builds of the game, it is theoretically possible for the them to pull the missing data, but I am unsure if there would be a realistic way to migrate it into any recent builds of the game.
---
Fluidity of design (the pieces flow together well)
---
Consistency of design
---
Intent of appearance
---
Effort
---
Matching effects to your theme and leaving out ones that don‚Äôt make sense. 
---
When I make an appearance I generally pick a piece of armor I want to build my look around
---
We will never see another skyscale thing again except for a handful of fixes and **GEMSTORE SKIN PACKS.**
---
How is it objectively better? That seems to be your strict subjective opinion that you didn't even back up.
---
I can see how running with those particular scissors might be difficult!
---
Yeah I would say max time for a daily is 30min. Being bad at jumping puzzles and getting stuck on long events can suck some time, but its still very easy.
---
Warrior uses the -exact- same Equipment. Maybe you need 2 Axes and 2 Maces but rest should be the same.
---
there is a jackal portal there
---
Oh hey, I see this picture made it on here :3 - I'm the charr on the blue skyscale.
---
Just started playing (lvl 77 thief) and looking for next profession. Would you say ele is close to thief or guardian? Looking for more AoE attacks
---
&gt; This is probably the wordiest way to say "Woosh." I've ever read.
---
&lt;3
---
The Skyscale with all its masteries can also quite easily scale that wall.
---
Fly to maximum height, grab on to the wall to recover more juice, go up some more, grab on the wall to recover more juice, rinse and repeat.
---
Takes perhaps 10s!
---
I know. It always comes as a shock. Though truth be told, everything besides the map completion can be done on the side and you could suddenly realize that you have enough. If you don't spent stuff for a while
---
Yup but the gold per hour there is terrible and you‚Äôd need some ascended to get to the higher tiers.
---
If I stopped eating, I could buy a big house too.
---
Okay. Sounds good. Thanks!!
---
oh hai Zhaitan
---
It must've been hard placing all those mocap markers on a real dragon. Stellar work!
---
I guess it's like when you're snoozing, but hungry, then you smell something tasty and you get up to go eat it.
---
I have a Logitech G600 and it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the naga.  The top 2 rows and bottom 2 rows slant into each other, and make figuring out which row you're pressing much easier.  Also I use the right-right mouse button as my push to talk, also much easier than most setups I've used in the past.
---
Thanks for the drawings. The path was already written out in text in the very original Champ train post but a visual guide definitely helps.
---
Yeah, when you see the only ones left are event completions and pvp/wvw hard dailies. I just want to pick plants.
---
No kangaroo, only kuhlimuh here. Me sorry
---
I do something similar but it‚Äôs more ‚Äúwould I wear this if I was x profession?‚Äù
---
For me, it starts with a concept. It can derive from the theme of the class itself, from a specific item (armor, weapon, backpiece) or from external sources.
---
You can see my toons here:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/Qv9bZa3](https://imgur.com/a/Qv9bZa3) 
---
The Mesmer was based on GW1 Mesmers, so a Court Illusionist kind of feel, keeping blues and greens for a colour scheme.
---
For my Necro, I went for a Dark Aristocrat theme.
---
My Ele's look is inspired by the White Mantle. There's an outfit available in the gem store, but the White Mantle we meet around the world use regular armor sets, with a specific color theme, so I tried to replicate that. 
---
Similarly, the Guardian was based on GW1 Paragons.
---
My Ranger's look (male) was inspired by Nissa Revane from MTG, the Warrior by Alexios from Assassin's Creed Odissey, the Thief by Dorian Pavus from Dragon Age Inquisition, and the Engineer by Balthier from FF12.
---
With the Rev, I went for a traditional White Knight look, with the added bonus that the Helmet reminds me of a Unicorn horn :D
---
It really comes down to personal taste. You know what works for you. If it's not important for you, then don't stress about it. For me, it's one of the most enjoyable parts of GW2, and the game really does make it easy and fun.
---
Do I need to watch it till the end to understand it?
---
Got bored.  All I saw was some asura falling from Rata sum and then the vid cuts to the sky scale hovering?
---
For me it has to be a unique look, not something you see all the time. There are some looks that are way too overused, like the bragon ball hair on char, the hundred different infusion effects at the same time, female humans with the viper skirt and krytan top combo or the underboob cultural armor.
---
If you show me a character with different armor pieces combined that has a consistent theme, that's what im going to call a good outfit, you can find many good ones on the gw2style website.
---
Also for me weapons  must fit the color scheme of the chatacter or the theme. Dyes are really important too, try using different dyes. Fun fact: black is not the only color!
---
GOD DON'T EVEN START ABOUT THAT
---
I was expecting a quirk from Canach EVERYTIME he showed up.
---
But NOTHING.
---
Like, there were perfect times that he shows up and ssys NOTHING.
---
I cry ):
---
I have done them every day for 3 1/2 years, other than when I was away from home.  Now I do em on 2 accounts.  It adds up for those who play the long game.
---
Who could have expected the price crash after giving us a meta that shits out rare unid. Gear
---
To add to that, watch YouTube videos of season 1 and you will get most of useful information to understand the characters going from it. It's not the perfect experience (we still ask anet to redo season 1 and wait they someday will) but it doesnt take as much from the experience if you like story like me. I combined that with exploring the maps where season 1 took place to understand a bit more and paid attention to old instance maps from the core game personal story. Storytelling in gw2 is told a great deal from the maps and npcs and events so, explore them with that in mind if you want more story of the world itself.
---
Do you stop getting the 2 gold when you hit the cap?  I'm not there yet but I am past the 3 year mark.
---
They should remove all the rare unid from the chests, i'm noticing it drops like 3 at times sometimes, a single kralky kill gives something like 40 just from chests alone. It already give champion bags anyway so those can drop the rares

Probably just 2 living story episodes and some festivals
---
I give it a 2. At least you tried.
---
I want 2 minutes of my life back.

[I've seen better](https://imgur.com/a/IqirvAX)
---
Lol you don't have to worry about anet listening to their players, they never do that
---
critical thinking is not allowed, 'tis the rule
---
thanks will give it a watch.
---
why? this addes zero gameplay value
---
Solo DPS vs. Raid Buffed DPS are very different and will require different builds and gear.
---
Solo and self buffed anything over 10k is pretty good, anything over 15k is really good.
---
Raid buffed most classes should be able to hit 28-30k with practice. However to be honest most of the casual raiding public would probably struggle to hit 20k.
---
female asura necromancers have the best voice lines in the whole game, don't @ me
---
Yea I‚Äôm getting over 100 ectos per meta.
---
Just thought about it some more and checked benchmarks. Yeah you right. Guess there's no easy way to test combat-like scenarios so perma-retal buff is the way to go for benchmarking.
---
no gameplay value to you maybe, but to some like the OP it gives something to do/replay for fun. I personally wouldn't probably do it again, but since the code is already there I would think it wouldn't be that hard to make it permanent. (then again SAB...)
---
Noob here. Can someone ELI5?
---
Agreed. Really takes me out of the game. I can‚Äôt feel like part of the world when I can literally see the map drop off into nothing and render as I move. Obviously in a game like this you could probably never eliminate that but...there has to be at least something they could do to make it seem less jarring. Just pull the detailed assets at a certain height and only render the landscape and foliage, would that free up more space to push the LoD further out? Idk.
---
That definitely sounds fun.
---
Why do you assume it's not intended? There's no new content coming for many months from now, so they want to keep people playing. And the best way with this playerbase is to bribe them with loot.
---
&gt;SC benchmarks are done without console retal 
---
this is also plain wrong. It's funny because you probably didn't even bother to check boons on a benchmark video before posting too.
---
Not on benchmark video but on general description.
---
should WoW random rainbow color the armour for that mmo astetic look
---
Then what is it about? Ive never figured that out and my intuition was wrong then.
---
Either way you are wrong so...
---
The DH in the video is using way more boons so he is cheating :/
---
Well yeah, i'm not saying they couldn't do that, just that I'd rather have it something we could attend and enjoy after all this world ending chaos. A nice way to open LS5 before the next shitshow starts for Tyria
---
The first few times I played it, to get to see what kind of story different races get, I enjoyed it quite a lot. And I still think it's a pretty good story, just could have been executed better but yknow, since it's such old content it's fine, what matters more is that you can see drastic improvement in the newer story.
---
&gt;No connection
---
Not being able to find and/or create a connection doesn't sound like the sort of science a good Asura would get up to.
---
Hopefully today is treating you better!
---
No if I remember anything from highschool it was Roy G. Biv who invented the rainbow.
---
Hm too fancy for me lol
---
Skyscale will compliment Griffon by allowing the freedom to climb sheer walls.  No more need to look for something climbable, just flap up, dismount and Griffon over to where you wanted to go.
---
Real talk time.   ANet has one of, if not the, best art teams in the world.   Seriously, next time you are in game just watch some random NPC or mob in the world and pay attention to all the subtle details they have (model, texture, animation, etc.) that makes everything that much more living and vibrant.
---
Power Holo and power reaper for me!
---
&gt; People compalin about time gates but not dailies is disgusting.
---
Sure sounded like you were comparing the two. If you can't convey your ideas in a way that is comprehensible, don't get mad at me for not understanding your views.
---
Dailies are akin to a buff you might get when you log in for the first time every day that makes you earn 10x more gold for 15 minutes. They're something you do if you're already going to log in, because they're just so good on a gold/time basis. They're not going to get you to log in, and they're not going to gate your progress like a timegate (which is the real reason that people don't like timegates, not because they force you to keep playing...).
---
They're no more of a chore than, say, fractals. I'm "missing out" if I don't do my T4s every day, because they're so much more lucrative than any other content I'm doing, but that's the decision I'm making when I decide to play that content instead of T4s: whatever reward I'm getting (monetary, achievement, or enjoyment from playing what I want to play) is more valuable to me than the reward I would get from playing T4s. 
---
They're just a very lucrative (in very short bursts) bit of content, you can choose to do it or ignore it. If you feel like you're "missing out" because you're skipping them, I have news for you, you're almost certainly "missing out" on far greater rewards playing whatever else you want to play in this game besides the top farms.
---
First you go saying:
---
Then you actually check a video and notice they do. So the next "logical step" is
---
&gt;The DH in the video is using way more boons so he is cheating :/
---
the benchmark itself is cheats :(
---
Not to mention future medical bills for cancer and the like. Extra special cleaning products for clothes if you do not want to smell like a bin. Etc.
---
But the same could be said if you look at how much money you waste on daily coffee. Or having a car instead of walking biking (if possible). 
---
Tl;dr: live your life.
---
And you are very aggressive and unfriendly. The general golem section does clearly state: "Most organized groups can maintain the following 7 boons, so we benchmark with those same 7 boons."
---
So its inconsistency on their end. Can you then do a proper benchmark and link it/post the numbers?
---
I used a GW1 character of mine for a very, very pissed-off White Mantle-hating ghost. The gist of it is that they're all quite obviously dead by now, some ties to families for the few humans I play.
---
I was kinda disappointed with the first scene of episode 6, but I kinda figured they did it right off the bat to reduce the chances of people getting it spoiled for them in map chat. Not that there weren't people talking about it in lions arch map chat a few hours later anyways...
---
&gt; Braham and Rox had to have new arcs written for them because they were largely aimless after LS1
---
What? NO. Neither Braham nor Rox's were aimless in LS1, their conflict and themes were clear from the get-go and have been relatively consistent (although sometimes badly written) right into Season 4. The slowness of their character development is just a consequence of the nature of how an MMO needs to tell its stories (if we, the audience, are to see any of it in-game). 
---
----
---
Kas and Marj being given smaller roles isn't unique to them. The writers have clearly been juggling a lot of characters in season 4. In various instances, we see people get excluded from major scenes or important episodes to share the spotlight better.
---
Two big examples:
---
* Braham was the ONLY one to join us in Joko's death gauntlet and final fight
---
* Canach doesn't say ANYTHING in Ep6
---
You take this information from where exactly?
---
He's a little busy working on the Universal Rule of Six: The Metaphysical Calculation of the Eternal Alchemy.
---
The idea being that everything of metaphysical importance within the Eternal Alchemy operates on a rule of 6. 6 gods, 6 elder dragons, 6 types of magic, and that understanding this will allow you to not only see the scope of reality but predict the threads of fate itself
---
I see, for how long is ideal to run the game with 3 3 enabled?
---
When is the great point to switch to 2 1, due to game always loading players I encounter for first time and such, or does the world load while I just have 3 3 enabled?
---
me thinking before mounts guards were the slowest class
---
running with 2 GS for world completion ;(
---
I have 14,000 ectos stocked up. Dreaming of the day ectos cross the 30s mark again...
---
just need to solo Aetherpath and we are free
---
I want it to not "stick" to surfaces I could otherwise run up. Wall clinging vs landing should correspond to what a land mount or character cant or can walk up.
---
I adore that layout, but Razer build quality...
---
I just did a practice run on 100 cm, averaged about 10k dps. Not sure if thats good, bad or somewhere inbetween?
---
Season 4 was constantly delayed after 1st episode, even though Zadorojny claimed updating their workflow to get episodes faster. Then lay offs happened. Now we are back with season finale and season 5 confirmed instead of expansion with no ETA of release (or even if it's already been worked on or is starting only now).
---
New (last?) raid wing will be played by 5-10% of the playerbase as usual, no mention of new fractal.
---
We will be baited to log in more by "bonus weeks" with "buffed" rewards like the world boss event not so long ago or coming soon meta event rush. These are all placeholders to make you feel something is happening.
---
Just gamble them all until you get both gambling achievs.
---
Note to mention WvW is limited to level 60 on F2p account so you have plenty of time to fix the shot in case you end up picking the wrong server.
---
Also Upgrading from F2p to paid account give a Free World Transfer to use.
---
while it is an immense drop they are still above the rate from january‚Ä¶ so its not that crazy.
---

---
Oh god. This is the reason I went to my bank and got my 100+ port to friends so I could just skip and go to the commander. 2 attempts I missed the kill, didn't need to use the port in the end but was a pain.
---
I LOVE the details on the coat. Nice work! Hope to see more from you.
---
If they do... They better bring GW2: Switch on the Table as well xD
---
Visit and see everything you care about in terms of single shot renderers and load-ins. Or keep running 3 3 until your RAM/VRAM is utilized to suitable levels.
---
Time gating is alright but it tied to a over hyped mount and the way the time gating forces people to complete achievements or they have to wait another day is evil. It would have been better if the reset opens a part of the skyscale achievements. People would still have to wait for a reset but they wouldn't feel forced to complete a set of achievements every day.
---
Like I log in for 3 days and each day will unlock another part of the skyscale achievement, and in my free day from work I can do 3 days full of achievements instead of waiting for a reset after completing one set of skyscale achievements.
---
&gt;They woke up because they were getting  hungry for more magic, why would having less magic again make them go  back to sleep? That's exactly what woke them up in the first place.
---
It's a bit more complicated than that.
---
It isn't so much that they woke up because they're hungry, but because they sensed there was a high amount of magic in the world. That said, in order to wake up, they had to first obtain a bunch of magic.
---
This is why the Elder Dragons had "Heralds" - champions who would wake up (or remain active in the world, it's unclear) and feed the Elder Dragon magic to help them rise when the world was ripe.
---
Primordus' Herald was the Great Destroyer; Jormag's was Drakkar; Zhaitan's is suggested to be the Giganticus Lupicus in Arah explorable; Kralkatorrik's was Glint; Mordremoth made an impromptu one via Scarlet Briar.
---
With losing that magic, it would appear that they're unable to maintain themselves. But on top of that, what Balthazar did was not only drain the two of magic, but also injured them heavily. This would be putting them into a comatose-like state.
---
In Episode 6, Braham states via letter read by Taimi, that Jormag encased itself in ice. Similarly, Primordus submerged into the lava. This may seem familiar to you if you played the new map's meta, where at the end, Kralkatorrik encases itself in crystal to avoid being damaged further. Similar concept all around.
---
In hindsight, it's unclear for sure if they're actually asleep, but they've certainly gone into a sleep-like state of dormancy where they're healing themselves. So the difference is ultimately moot.
---
The main difference between now and when the Elder Dragons normally go into hibernation, however, is that there's still a ton of magic in the world, and there are hundreds of destroyers and icebrood that can fulfill the role of the Heralds.
---
And FREE GEMS plz!
---
But the when is the big mystery
---
Do they accept commissions/would it be possible for you to link to their art page if you know it?
---
How does your character's neck not snap from the weight of that unseemly huge helm.
---
raid releases are already a meme and many consider wing 7 to be the end of raiding for gw2, anet is allowed to prove me wrong though, I dare them :)
---
JJ Abrams meets the "all of the glowing shit!" GW2 culture.
---
May God help us all.
---
Perhaps that bright white orb represents aurene?
---
Completely understandable.  Waiting isn't a bad option, I just wanted be comprehensive with my explanation.  Just keep in mind that the expansion content is higher quality than the old core content - so if you like what you've seen, but are on the fence, you'll probably enjoy the dlc content more.
---
[Here is the official digital retailer list for Germany.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#Germany-digital)  But, it doesn't matter what region/country you buy it in (except China) - if you find a US-only deal, the code would still work for EU.
---
I feel your pain!  100 more Mistonium to GOO!!!  SCREW Jahia BLUFFS!
---
I think that center orb is literally Tyria, the 7th dragon.
---
This is really inefficient but I have my weapon skills bounded to E,R,F,V,C. My utility skills are shift modified and my profession skills are Ctrl modified. Special action on Z, interact in Q, mount on X, and menu on 1-8.
---
This is fine for PvE, but I might change this up as I start doing more PvP.
---
No, i think "you" consider it the end, not "many". There's no reason they can't add raids and fractals to the season 5 release rotation like in season 4, even with the layoffs
---
No, i think "you" consider it the end, not "many." There's no reason they can't add raids and fractals to the season 5 release rotation like in season 4, even with the layoffs
---
To many people buying gems at the same time and the Black Lion site had to be looped back.  That is what most likely happened....... A.net Spaghetti code at its best.
---
You can easily generalize any story to common tropes. I'll now ask you to name a book or game that doesn't use popular tropes. What have you read that's so different?
---
&gt; There's no reason they can't 
---
There's no reason to abandoning many other things in the past, they still did it. The question is if they want to release more raids.
---
No I'm pretty sure the the people I talked to hate the map itself.
---
Bloodstonr Fen, Lake Doric and Draconis Mons are really fun maps to explore and do events in, so I can recommend S3 chapters 1, 4, and 5.
---
Haven't finished S4 yet, but the meta in Domain of Istan from chapter 1 is a lot of fun.
---
There is an in-game model, as that's what the OP's linked videos shows, it just doesn't have proper textures for it so it's left black for effects to be added. They intentionally left it very ambiguous and hard to see, covering it with lens flares, but the model does exist all the same.
---
If we see Aurene again, there is a 100% chance the model will change. Just like how we technically get 4 renditions of Kralkatorrik since PoF alone (5 models and 3 concept art designs used in the games if we go all the way back to Eye of the North).
---
Why wouldn't they want to after having restructured the fractal and raid teams to work in both fields?
---
They only nerfed istan when they knew this new farm is coming. Same happened with AB multiloot, being nerfed shortly before the release of Istan. Everything is going according to plan, player horde is being moved like pawns by anet all the time.
---
It says a hint reminding you to select attributes, not a hint as to what you had it set to before
---
SHINIES!!!
---
nah but like it's all subjective. Having a consistent aesthetic theme and good color scheme is always a plus though
---
Because of exactly that, they merged both teams to cut costs, later they laid off multiple people from the merged team. They clearly see no interest in this content besides maintaining and fixing what's already released (plus wing 7).
---
i've had the same, could only queue if i invited someone else to play with me, fixed itself the next day, quite frustrating
---
I only just got the egg in suns refuge! How much further?
---
Well, you clearly speak for anet and their wants and needs
---
Then what do you use for Strafe Left, Right, Target?
---
Much, much further than that
---
&gt;  Q E
---
How do you strafe?
---
[This](https://www.deviantart.com/munwie) is their Deviantart profile.
---
I am unsure about commissions.
---
Holy shit, that is terrific. The colors, the details, the facial expression - welcome to the community. I hope this won't be your last piece!
---
‚ô´ You will not go astray ‚ô´
---
I just got back too, owned the base game since like forever, played only for like a week back then.
---
Doesnt matter which area, I have always found a lot of people running around, doing events, exploring etc so the game is very much alive imo. 
---
Leveled to like 40 then boosted my char to 80 to unlock the mount for faster alt leveling/exploration!
---
I explain to you my reasoning based on my observations. I m also willing to be pleasantly surprised by future releases by anet. Will that happen? I doubt that.
---
You on the other hand do not present any arguments, you came here with the mission of being defensive no matter what. If you want to engage into the discussion, please bring something to it besides trying to dis anything your partner says.
---
In the everything else category instead of unchecked it says "unhecked" which honestly is a hilarious typo
---
So you have no idea either. Thanks that's all I wanted to know.
---
GW2 has some horrible routing problems. Tons of people are having non stop disconnects, lag, etc. All caused by the Telia backbone
---
You can see user complaints here: https://www.google.ca/search?q=gw2+telia
---
And yes, the only way to play GW2 efficiently if you have these problems is using a VPN that bypasses the problematic node.
---
I'm guessing Hotspot shield worked for that guy. I went with https://windscribe.com/ and it solved my disconnect issues
---
Actually, you're the one spouting "ded gaem" sentiments and giving baseless arguments based on what "many people" feel is true, while I am backing up my arguments based on what i actually know about anet.
---
I'm expressing my opinions based on my observations. you are free to share your point of view as long as it's properly backed. That's how discussion works. Your "witty" comments have no value besides clear goal of being defensive.
---
&gt; There's no new content coming for many months from now
---
Well you expressed it as a fact, not as an opinion (as "there might not be content coming for many months" or similar would have been), so I was merely wondering whether you had any actual information or just stated your guesses in fact form, as is fashionable in the this subreddit.
---
As for my guesses, I assume they will try and stick to the current cadence and go right into season 5, since they emphasised that keeping this going was important to them several times around the PoF launch. That was quite some time ago thought and a few delays in the transition to S5 and due to the layoffs would not be surprising. What it really comes down to is that I have no real way of knowing what will happen, since they havn't told us, but then I don't go around claiming I do.
---
I have my utilities all bound to shift number and default almost everything else. I also have my #2 ability bound to a mouse button because fucking everything I play spams 2
---
&gt; its not my fault you fail to read. i compared peoples stances on the subjects not the subject themselvs. i didn‚Äôt fail to convey my idea. you fail to read.
---
All you said was the one sentence I quoted. There was no nuance there, nothing that I'm missing over overlooking. You compared the two, you didn't say on what basis. The meaning I took from it was entirely within the bounds of what you wrote. Again, if you want to be understood, it's your duty as the person communicating to be understandable. 
---
And your argument appears to be that you are "missing out" on the daily AP. That is like saying you're "missing out" because you're not getting the AP available for PvP or WvW because you don't like that content. If you don't like to do something, that's fine, but you won't get the achievement for it. I don't see why you think this should be something people are up in arms about. 
---
Heck, it's actually nice that the daily AP is capped. That means you're never fully missing out, so much as you are choosing to make the climb to the cap longer. That's fine. That's your choice. You don't like that, then do the achievement and get the AP reward.
---
As long as the setup is cohesive and looks intended to match in some way.  Just throwing all the expensive stuff together doesn't always work.
---
Blinding shinies is not always ideal for every look either.  Sometimes less is better.
---
I don't buy gems, and I wouldn't whether I enjoyed the design or not, but that's just me. The people who would shell out the most would do so whether they were happy with the game or not. That's something I learned after working with tips, like 90% of the time its a pre-determined amount and not actually because you went above and beyond.
---
I actually got 250 of each LS4 map currency before thinking they'll add a trinket like Aurora.
---
Your problem is you expect me to write "in my opinion" in every post. Everything here is an opinion ny default, only rare user posts come as facts.
---
Anyway, thank you for sharing your pov. Time will tell who was right today.
---
Oh no sweetie...
---
Start gathering 250 of each of the LW S4 map currencies now, and 500 Trade Contracts from the Crystal Desert. You're going to have some "down time" while feeding the hatchling...don't squander that time like I did...
---
 - Domain of Istan : Kralkatite Ore
---
 - Sandswept Islands : Diflourite Crystal
---
 - Domain of Kourna : Inscribed Shard
---
 - Jahai Bluffs : Lump of Mistonium
---
 - Thunderhead Peaks : Branded Mass
---
 - Dragonfall : Mistborn Mote
---
 - General Path of Fire zones : Trade Contract
---
I promise you, having these ready will be something you're thankful for in a few days...
---
15 gold for 8 days is not such a good deal.
---
Its sad to see you only "support" the game with words, not with actions. That's your choice though it doesnt help much.
---
Play with friends, goof around with strangers, interact with people, do random goofy shit WvW. I have most fun when I utilize the MM in MMO. The type of content doesn't really matter to me, it's the little that matter.
---
But are you actually alive if you just go through the motions? Drugs help raise mental awareness if used with responsibility.
---
None of ours were successful, he has the bubble that shields him.
---
IDK. Honestly from what I've heard, the general consensus is that watching guild wars pvp is "boring" unless you really know what's going on. I find it interesting but, then again, I have an understanding of the game.
---
Hm. People reference known facts or at least outlined positions e.g. by the developers rather frequently in my experience, but I do agree: In order to find out what really will happen we will just have to wait and see.
---
I don't think a game like GW1 would make a good ESport game. Too many possible options, and not interesting enough to watch.
---
Oh...my...
---
Thank you very much for the heads up, I read I needed food and started making that ahead of time. 
---
This mount is a right pain! :D
---
I mean, the whole no subscription fee is exactly what brought me over to GW2. If they drop another xpac, I'd gladly buy it. Otherwise, I'm just gonna play the game and enjoy all the content I can. PvE, PvP, and WvW, this game has more to do than I could ever ask for.
---
As others have mentioned standing in the middle will help a little if the return throw happens to be at the other side of the zone.
---
You can also try turning on the action cam. That way your character will turn and run in that direction rather than strafing left or right or walking backwards.
---
Most people bind AD to Strafe Left/Right because traditional WASD with AD being left/right is known as keyboard turning.  It's a bad habit to get into because it's much slower.  It's not a problem for general PvE, but anything competitive any sort of lag is a problem.  If you bind AD to strafe left and right you won't really know the difference after about 1-2 weeks anyway.
---
Didn't they say they didn't want to do a gold cap like they did with the Griffin? I've spent so much gold on the mount already (around 70 for the food and toy so another 35 for the future collection brings it up to 105), and not to mention the grind. Compared to the skyscale, the Griffin is nothing. All I had to do was save up 250 gold and got the mount in a day.
---
Im sorry
---
Yeah you can always get a head start on the what KyuubiJRR said, so even though it will be time gated for pretty much this weekend only, get a head start on that. It will save you time.
---
No, it is not possible to stop.
---
Don't lewd animals
---
It's a lot like Path of Exile.  It's watchable, but a lot of the depth doesn't really transfer to easy, non-invested viewing.  Most of the characters in games like League, DoTA II or even Overwatch are fairly iconic -- you know what to expect.  In GW1 &amp; GW2 pretty much every class can be built a dozen or more different ways and the rapid casting of abilities obscures purity of purpose -- it becomes hard to decipher what is or isn't spam and what major abilities to watch out for.
---
me too except the branded mass due to the dragons blood collections. I'm about 80 off which is an easy day of grinding hearts
---
Run alts through the Tomb of Primeval Kings for trade contracts. Very easy.
---
Since there are no hearts on Dragonfall, I figured it was just a matter of finding a great road going from low to high since the map is veeery vertical. Though in this video I made a whole lot of meh mistakes. **I guarantee the time can be cut well down!**
---
If you have a lot of toons, this is probably the absolute fastest method of getting Mistborn Motes, plus the occasional chance for a BLTC key (I got 9 in total from running all my toons through, though the majority was just transmutation charges :P).
---
I really love how the Skyscale rounds off the overall mount experience by filling in for the moments where the griffon or the bunny just feel odd/slow/impractical to use! It's not supposed to be a mount that you exclusively use. It just makes the overall experience that much more fluid!
---
Sounds like you and I are talking about different kinds of smoking.
---
Also, while I'm not at all against mind altering substances, if you have trouble feeling alive without them, you may want to consider other life changes or counseling.
---
if it looks like a full set but actually isnt
---
Out of the 4 rows of buttons i personally discard the last row as it makes me stretch too much my fingertip to reach those buttons confortably during normal gameplay.
---
Then from the remaining 3 rows my "resting position" is in the middle row. The 3 buttons there are attached to the most common used keys. From there i have no problems to stretch my thumb finger one row up or down. 
---
Of course the fourth row also has some key buttons attached but they are for things you ussually use in towns and definitely out of combat.
---
I don't think I've ever heard anyone present clinically-proven evidence that nicotine raises mental awareness better than a cup of coffee does, or even at all.
---
Hey, I'm a casual gamer (40+) looking for a game in which I can 'feel' the progress.  
---
Also I tend to choose a class by the... color theme of the buttons... yes... I'm that weird. I enjoy the blue of the guardian :)  
---
Any pointers about the state of GW2? I head that something bad happened this year with the company / they stopped support (?) / I don't know exactly what. Is the game still alive?  
---
In the pictures and videos I saw the players had a Massive inventory with 'too many' different items / things. Is inventory management a big part of the gameplay?  
---
Thanks.
---
Oh My point is just, it happening "offscreen" would be no excuse for them not mentioning it.
---
I agree, would be nice, if nothing else as a mini-event.
---
It's one of the two possibilities I think are most likely:
---
* There's a 7th dragon sleeping at the core of the world, oozing the magic that forms the leylines.
---
* A dragon turned into the planet itsefl. Leylines are her blood vessels, magic her blood, and portals to other realms and to the mists have formed over the years (most naturally, some intentionally), bringing to the planet creatures from other worlds, water, land masses and other stuff, covering her until she ended up trapped in the surface of a planet. 
---
I also suspect that The Dream the pale tree taps into to give knowledge to the Sylvari is her dream, so powerful that it can be entered physically like the metaspace inside Kralkatorrik, as she sleeps an eternal sleep and the magic that flows in and out of her returns with memories and experiences of those who live on her surface.
---
Correction, promote tells you what it does btw. If u smack another target it SHOULD promote it as your new locked target
---
Said should bcuz its not doing it for me unless I have auto target on
---
Although time travel is not out of the question, that's nearly impossible since the orb was there since recorded history, as seen in the ceiling of the Priory Archives.
---
Will it not change targets after the 1st? Like if u hit another
---
If not then what's the point of having promote target as an option that only works with auto target of auto target already targets for you automatically
---
I've had this happen too but only briefly, this is amazing
---
Dont forget the merchant in new map
---
I don't find it toxic, maybe just popular. With its popularity there is bound to be some people who ignore the mobs by the nodes, as they spawn when people gather berries and you get bored of killing them eventually. On the other hand the mobs die fast for people who get tagged, so it shouldn't be an issue.

#metoo
---
Finally.
---
Your server name is also edgy.
---
&gt; Also I tend to choose a class by the... color theme of the buttons... yes... I'm that weird. I enjoy the blue of the guardian :) 
---
Not that weird, try mesmer if you like purple/pink
---
People sometimes call guild wars 2 "Fashion wars 2" just because there's a huge emphasis on fashion at end game, so we're used to people playing for the aesthetics 
---
&gt; Any pointers about the state of GW2? I head that something bad happened this year with the company / they stopped support (?) / I don't know exactly what. Is the game still alive? 
---
Yeah, we're still fine
---
There was a huge lay off wave (400 people down to 250), but we're still going strong, and it feels like they've actually renewed efforts on GW2 as opposed to some other side projects they had
---
&gt; In the pictures and videos I saw the players had a Massive inventory with 'too many' different items / things. Is inventory management a big part of the gameplay? 
---
Yes. It was so much worse before one of the most recent updates, but there is still a bit of inventory management going on all the time.
---
The biggest thing missing from GW2 was the build diversity from GW1. Mixing and matching secondary professions, and the huge variation of skillbar setups you could come up with.
---
If only they had done this with GW2...‚Ä¶ I'm still dumbfounded they let this slip and moved away from it going into GW2
---
Sweet.  Excellent pro tip.
---
My human thief is a descendent of my old GW1 ranger. There have always been these tall tales in the family about his adventuring great-great-...-grandfather, who is said to have even traveled with the legendary Prince Rurik across the Shiverpeaks. Although, admittingly, he does not really know whether these stories are actually true.
---
These "Sic \`Em!" rangers are getting younger and younger...
---
This looks very helpful, thanks!
---
I about farmed out with Mystonium after completing the elegy collection.  250 more?  Ugh.
---
YOLO
---
but tekkitsworkshop has some trails that might be useful to you
---
Positioning yourself in the back almost forces you to use some kind of speed boost if the white circle ends up on the opposite side.
---
Maybe i was lucky myself. Failed my first try on hard on the second ball and inmediatelly realized that positioning on the middle was the best idea. And it sure was a good decision. Got it done on the 2nd try easily. Didn't need to use speed boost or anything. The white circle was always a few steps away, and if it was backwards on the very edge i only had to dodgeroll into it's direction and i would reach with time to spare before the ball.
---
I got sooo much Mistonium today. I think I did almost 40 hearts in that map across way too many characters that had no good equipment or builds because they never get played, and I did the Thunderhead and Sandswept hearts across three characters. I can recommend watching an old show on a second monitor, I'm on my fifth episode of Star Trek TOS today.
---
Still need 120 Inscribed Shards and almost 200 Mistborn Motes but at least those last ones I can get by just playing the new content.
---
Thanks for being interested! https://twitter.com/yacrical
---
I quite recently set up a twitter account. Tbf I'm still learning the ropes but I'll get the hang of it pretty soon hopefully.
---
Also thank you! I appreciate that a lot :)
---
I didn't have Kourna stacked cause that map sucked.  Or  the shiver peak one cause I made a ton of weapons.
---
Also, the legendary trinket from last season still has an awful unavoidable graphic, so I assumed this one would too and I could skip it.
---
Plenty of reasons not to have them.  Easily farmed though...took like two evenings of play.  The whining is excessive.
---
"This rose has thorns. HERE THEY ARE!"
---
All mount skins so far have been lore accurate I doubt well get Aurene for obvious reasons.
---
Despite all the negative feed back in reddit.  I think overall this collection had a positive inpact on the game.  I am finding my guild active for longer in this release.  This is where people come here to complain I hope the devs take all this here with a grain of salt.
---
All the LS4 maps are way more active than they were 2 weeks ago.  People are actually able to get some achievements they had missed now.  Giving people desirable and long term goals to drive activity in content is what the game should be doing.  
---
I mean lets be real here, anyone that is complaining about having to put some time into the game would have just unlocked the skyscale instantly and never logged on after the game anyway.  It is a lose/lose situation to cater to these players.  
---
Many of us had enjoyed the progression of raising and obtaining said mount.  The only qualm I had about this collection is the 4 day wait period on the feeding part, which they said they would fix.
---
Yes. Them.
---
I'm going to be so sad if we get a Super Adventure Box skyscale instead of an Aurene skyscale, and i don't even buy mount skins
---
I targeted nothing with auto target off and promote on
---
Yes the mounts are account wide. I just had this same problem last night.
---
I would use one 80 token and get a profession you think you will want in the future. Go unlock the raptor, it takes less than 20 minutes. Then go back to your other character and enjoy it.
---
JP did mention something in her tweets about Aurene being Elder Dragon of light, not the crystal dragon like kralk, which is why the ending cinematic was the way it was.
---
I have no idea. i dont relly hunt for ap more for the items you get
---
I don't disagree that its canon lore, but it still looks out of place. Aurene pre- or post-ascension would just look cooler, in my opinion
---
broken how?
---
You can also use grenades as a melee type by just throwing them at your feet while you run around. Don't even aim, just gather up mobs and drop nades as you go!
---
I am Malyck
---
If its use is a supplement to make griffon stronger then doesn't that mean it actually needs a buff?
---
So when are we getting the farming/western expansion? Guild Dead Redemption 2?  
---
Seriously though, this is amazing! Great work!
---
Awesome!
---
How is not broken? How is being one shot from stealth enjoyable? Or how is one class able to 3 v 1 without dying?
---
Nice.  Was wondering how the aoe thing worked.  Figured I was just too low level.
---
Thanks! The helmet is Bounty Hunter.
---
&gt; How is not broken? 
---
well i was able to play just an hour ago
---
&gt; How is being one shot from stealth enjoyable? Or how is one class able to 3 v 1 without dying?
---
those sound like "you suck" problems
---
Your best bet is the festival of the 4 winds to unload them.
---
I always do training runs if I can but xera scares me, will watch if I can
---
I worked in Adelaide once right after I am Legend came out. I kept thinking they should have filmed the movie there because the streets were empty on the weekends and after 530.
---
Achievement unlocked Icarus
---
They are instant casts. Put your mouse on the screen, hold right click so the cursor disapears. This keeps your aoe target on the spot, so you put it under your character. Run around and pull aggro on all the mobs start smashing keys and you'll 'drop' your grenades under you and instantly hit the mobs chasing you... also they have a large range.
---
Have fun!!
---
Typical fanboi lol... "LEaRn tO pLaY" or "jUsT dOdGe"
---
You need 12 charged quartz for the whole food thing.
---
Even though you can feed the skyscale three times daily, you can only charge quartz once daily, so in case someone is missing charge quartz they have to wait longer than 4 days to feed it fully, unless they buy stuff on the TP.
---
Now just wait for Tekkit to steal this and taco route it.
---
Did you get an email confirming they received your ticket?  
---
If yes, then all you can do is wait.  Don't submit a second ticket or it will slow down the process.

Uhhh, Super Adventure Box song covers with a banjo?
---
Aw, I really should have thought about this for my SAB cover last month :O
---
Anet, consistently inconsistent :^)
---
you're in the game's subreddit... of course the fans are here, it's our community.
---
do you walk in to Baskin Robbins and whine about all the ice cream fanbois there?
---
if you harvest your home instance daily, you would have had several stacks of the map currencies already (assuming you bought the home instance nodes of each season when it came out).
---
It's only advantage in PvE is that it's got a lot of HP. But it's comparatively slow and has a now anemic jump, cause walls and gates have been a buggy suggestion in WvW for years now.
---
She looks more like a sb than a druid.. place bets
---
Haha but using a combination of all 3, you can circle strafe while looking somewhere else :)
---
Expecting Anet to balance things properly is like expecting someone to walk on water.
---
Balancing is and always has been one of Anet's weakest points, so I'm curious as to where you've been all this time.
---
balance is broken\*
---
quite different

Nobody streams MMOs. WoW is an exception because it's basically a twitch meme at this point. What MMO have you ever watched a streamer play?
---
Victory has defeated you
---
By our powers combined!
---
The hint is when you go hit something and do no damage to it!
---
What a *Petey*.
---
I'm in my thirties, so old enough for 'hard as balls and less mercy than Miss Whiplash' games. Progress in GW2 is more 'holistic' than the average MMO; you hit max level, then there's a secondary progression system, them it's down to personal goals (better, more specific gear, Fashion Wars, achievements, difficult content). 
---
I entirely chose mesmer because they use a shield at level 80, so choosing guardian because they're blue and flashy is a valid motivation, in my view. 
---
There were a large number of redundancies as the company restructured. However, new content was released this month and the game looks like it's healthy. While sad, it probably ensured the game would continue rather than let resources thin out. 
---
You do accumulate a lot of crap in this game, but there are ways of managing it. It's not as bad as it looks. Salvage all your shit and sell what you don't need and you're halfway there.
---
I like to see cool, novel, well-implemented ideas. If you can nail the overall idea and the fine details at the same time, that's awesome. My current main appearance is an Agent Smith based condi mirage with axe pistol/staff or axe sword/staff, using the devout main set pieces and the gem store shades plus a tiny bit of flavor in the gloves.
---
People report this happening sometimes and the best thing to do is contact support and they'll clear it up for you.
---
Sometimes it is a problem with your bank, so you could check with them too.  More often it is an issue/hold on your GW account to protect against fraud.
---
Can someone who is just starting back up from before POF and hot where a thing but has alot of saved up gold get this quicker than normal? And if not where's best place to start? I just finished getting 30/50 on gw1 and forgot everything again on gw2 lol
---
Might as well go ahead and quit
---
I think the thing is, if you put it off, you're less likely to ever finish it. It took me a long time to finish the griffon, and that's after everyone saying how amazing it is.
---
If I treated the Skyscale the same, I would probably never have finished it since everyone is saying it's a bad mount. Long collections, time gates, annoying collections, tons of farming? If I stopped for a break, I would have never went back to it.
---
What equipment are you using?
---
This actually very cool. I like it.
---
Next patch : *"We don't want players to spend their whole day in there farming, therefore we are nerfing the rewards."*
---
I could throw the entire rest of my switch library in the trash if gw2 found a way on
---
Touhou wars 2.
---
Personal Pact Chopper.. anet pls
---
I heard that the expansions are even better, so far I'm having a real smooth experience and I still dabble around in the low lvl areas and get downscaled.
---
To me it really feels like a better version of skyrim with all the running around and exploration...and I hated skyrim because I found this very stuff so dull there.
---
How expensive are the living world DLCs if you buy them in their shop? Are they also 30-40 EUR per piece?
---
Wonderful work! Now I want a take on Maclaine's version.
---
Check his tag, his name is Charrlie ;) 
---
I still have him from when the game came out. He chills next to my blue quaggan from the store, and a pink quaggan I made! They're good buds.
---
guess those shades are too strong
---
The background is pre-rendered, I thought it was part of that.
---
I mean regardless of what the tag says he'll always be Rytlock in my eyes :)
---
Also that's kinda hilarious now that you mention it cause I have a Charr named Charlie lol
---
You're pretty good.
---

---
Looking at the ecto trend in its lifetime, it will go back to its price around the low 20S, that is if anet doesn't add anything that affects the supplies and once people get their skyscale.
---
Overall, I'd say the time to sell has already passed, its probably better to buy or to hoard until the hype passes.
---
Same with the sunstone nugget, price was around the 20s, but a night or two ago it went as low as 14s.
---
&gt; just wait
---
NOOOO
---
To answer you seriously,  usually before every season there is a new balance patch that shakes things up a bit, there always is a bit of imbalance, and PvP can be frustrating at tines. 
---
Out of curiosity what do you play that gets one shot though, because honestly the only classes I can see that is a base elementalist or a thief similarly.  Definitely not the best PvP in the world but honestly that kind of thing  only happens in pretty extreme cases.
---
Depends on how badly you want to spend now.  Lots of time there are gemstore sales in June and for sure in August because of the anniversary.  Anything you're likely to buy will be on sale then.  The only thing I think is worth getting now instead of waiting (even though it'll likely be on sale) is the Copper Fed.  The rest, I would would wait.  Personally, tp to friend, material storage expanders, shared slots, char slots or bank slots.  Copper fed is for sure first thing though.
---
There you go, because it was requested, i did some comparative runs of climbing situations. This should hopefully end the debates and help in amending the unjustified negativity. The Skyscale is an awesome addition to our mount pool and ArenaNet did a good job with its design.
---
Too much to watch, too little time? Have some shortcuts:
---
https://youtu.be/1x7fW6Jp3jM?t=100 for the Thunderhead Peaks climbing
---
https://youtu.be/1x7fW6Jp3jM?t=247 for the first Desert Highlands traversal
---
https://youtu.be/1x7fW6Jp3jM?t=345 for the second Desert Highlands traversal
---
https://youtu.be/1x7fW6Jp3jM?t=491 for the first Dragonfall climb
---
https://youtu.be/1x7fW6Jp3jM?t=582 for the second Dragonfall climb
---
And as a bonus: Skyscale priming for the Griffon in a flat area! Much safer with a little bit of a ledge, but you get the idea.
---

---
Outfits are are a -100% fashion modifier. Full sets are close. Zero creativity when using these.
---
White/asian human girls with blindfolds and wings are also a -100%. There are so many of them and they all look like anime trash.
---
Color combinations of black, white, and red knock off a few points. Too common. Monocolor is also a no-go. Dark colors tend to be a problem since in most lighting conditions you will lose all detail in your armor, so they're better off as accents.
---
Ideal look has a few interesting pieces that stand out a bit, but not too much that it looks gaudy. Unless you are deliberately trying to look like as much of an eyesore as possible, which I can respect.
---
&gt; Typical /r/guildwars2 here... You simultaneously twist my comment (to complement is not to supplement) and ignore what I said.
---
Make yourself clearer in the first place or correct me without throwing an insufferably smug pitty party for yourself. 
---
"Typical" 
---
Christ, I could feel the shockwave that fedora tip from all the way over here, I'll have to be on the lookout for a dorito dust storm.
---
&gt;Skyscale isn't Griffon. GW2 isn't about upgrades, it's about side-grades.
---
Which skyscale is not. It doesn't offer anything new that other mounts couldn't already do. 
---
&gt;Skyscale is a slower, more accurate vertical ascender that can scale sheer cliffs.
---
Before I move on, special mention to this. No, it can't. If you try to scale a cliff with the skyscale your green bar will deplete and the red bar will start filling up even if you stand perfectly still.
---
Its intentionally artificially handicapped to NOT be able to scale cliffs.
---
&gt; Skyscale is a slower, more accurate vertical ascender that can scale sheer cliffs. Springer ascends faster, but requires ledges and you can lose progress with a bad jump. Griffon can't take a break from flying, can't really ascend, but with some ability to drop will grant you great horizontal distance.
---
Everything the skyscale does, griffon and springer already do. Each mount before the skyscale had a clear and distrinct purpose, function and terrain specialty:
---
Raptor for long range flat gaps, Springer for vertical jumps, Skimmer for water and quicksand, Jackal for navigating rough terrain, Griffon for horizotal air travel and beetle for long range flat ground travel.
---
The skyscale has no clarity of purpose. Everything it does can already be accomplished by other mounts, its just a slow elevator and it can only shine on the new map that is specifically designed for it.
---
The other mounts had a real purpose. This one is a novelty.
---
And you know what the funny thing is? The design that went behind it confirms this. All the other mounts were designed with function first, and form second.
---
I.e. "We need a high jump. Lets do a bunny."
---
The skyscale was designed with form first, THEN function. i.e. "We want a dragon. What should it do?" 
---
This lack of identity is just a logical consequence of that deisgn philosophy.
---
Probably not.
---
Look at all the biggest esport titles out now. None of them require countless hours farming what you need to make your build. That is exactly what GW1 was.
---
In CSGO, you don't need to play for tons of hours to unlock all the weapons and grenades. You just have them all at the start. For Dota 2, you have all the characters at the start. In Overwatch, you get all the characters the second they are released. Things like LoL and Siege have the option to just buy all the characters. Without having all the options available the second the things come out, it results in those things being banned from competitive play for a time. We saw it with TF2, this is a big (but not only) part of why it never caught on in esports.
---
Balance is also really hard when you have this many classes, and this many skills. In CSGO, you always want a rifle or an AWP. If the game worked like CoD, that means every other weapon would never be used, but the way the games economy works forces teams to use worse weapons from time to time. If you get to choose the best things from the start, it's really likely that teams would generally be formed around using just a few classes, all mostly using the same skills.
---
Then there's just the fact that MMOs are generally only fun to watch if you play that MMO. When you just have a big cluster fuck of characters doing things to each other, unless you are big into that game, you'll have no idea why that play was so impressive. You even see this a lot when someone posts a video to a MMO subreddit. A lot of the comments end up being "...what am I looking for?". With games like CSGO and Siege, it's really easy for people who aren't big players of the game, to know that wall bang kill was super lucky. That grenade from across the map was really well timed. That the split second flick was a really skillful kill. Casual players might not understand all the nuance of the tactics, why a smoke was thrown there, why the molly was thrown there, etc, but there's enough going on for them to understand. MMOs usually don't have this, which makes them really boring to watch. That perfectly timed CC when you where almost dead, turning the fight around, easily goes over the heads of most of the people watching. Your insane play just gets taken as "oh, he killed that guy I guess".
---
havent even started
---
I understand why they made the decision to not allow free flight for the skyscale and i can even agree that it's somewhat boring to allow it. We have the griffon and it's a lot of fun.
---
But the skyscale just isn't fun for me. Even with all it's masteries it feels clunky. I honestly won't bother using it unless it's absolute necessary.
---
what is the max?
---
That up smash.
---
my guess is bag alts?
---
equipment and characters endpoint having some issues  [https://status.gw2efficiency.com/](https://status.gw2efficiency.com/)
---
&gt;  think the thing is, if you put it off, you're less likely to ever finish it.
---
That is true but if you are worried about that then you have no confidence in the mount itself.
---
Griffon also can't be compared. You get to try out the skyscale as part of the story while the griffon requires you to finish a much longer story.
---
That's largely on me for doing it all at once at this horrible pace. I think most of the skyscale collection stuff--finding all kinds of skyscale related things in Dragonfall, doing the jumping puzzles and world bosses, playing with the skyscale, traveling all over and doing map content at those locations to purchase collection items--is good content. It's just a bit much all at once.
---
If it was a bit more spread out, those would be much more fun. Finding 20 (I just picked a number here and stuck with it) skyscale things is cool, but then finding another 20 as the next thing is really weird. If you instead found 20 on the first day's collection and another 20 on the third day's collection, it'd feel much better. Same thing for bundling all 20 jumping puzzles together into one collection that you do all at once. I actually liked that because I love those old jumping puzzles but the way it's spread out is just silly.
---
Those hearts are fun the first 1-2 times, and they can be fun another 1-2 times at the end of the season when you haven't done them in months. I think it's good that ANet tells us to go back and do those again. It's just doing them every day as a routine or grinding them out in a single day that sucks.
---
I feel the same way. There has been a lot of build up for both of these Elder Dragons present since the beginning of the game, and it would be disappointing if there aren't conclusions to these things. Perhaps the Sons of Svanir could take an interest in reawaken their slumbering spririt of the wild. It seems strange to leave so many lingering plot threads related to those two dragons. I wasn't ready to be done with them.
---
This exactly.
---
There is no reason to grind this out as fast as you can. Just hop into the maps as you feel like it, complete a couple of hearts, and move on to something you enjoy more.
---
I really don't understand why people are doing this to themselves.
---
True. I have reaper in full balded, except the head. Head is reapers hood, as bladed light head looks quite bad. XD
---
More bank tabs, material storage expander (can increase it to a stack of 2,000 to but in your bank material storage) Copper salvage-o-matic.
---
[Here is an extensive breakdown of Action Camera functions if you're interested.](https://youtu.be/6kbTbs3YC_g?t=4188) ~40min of video.
---
I don't bother with legendaries so there hasn't been any reason for me to farm the currencies. Also I started season 4 less than 2 months ago.
---
Complaining about "cliches" is the laziest possible critique one can have about a narrative. It requires no thought or effort beyond recognizing some small part of a story that happens to be found somewhere else as well - but most using it don't even put that much effort in. A complaint without specifics is far closer to an unsubstantiated insult than it is to constructive criticism.
---
So is Jessica Price joining for a raid wing or not? I'm confused.
---
Would like to watch it while they talk about lore.
---
(For the record, I'm not dismissing what happened earlier, but I am willing to forgive and forget.)
---
Are you one of the people upset about the currency then?
---
I think I'm going all out and buying the copper fed, bank tabs, unbreakable tools, and more material storage. Although I know NOTHING about crafting, it seems like a huge part of the game.
---
Its not necessarily being one shot, it's more about being killed so quickly you have little time to react. Depending on which class I play, it sometimes comes down to whoever attacks first.
---
This is amazing! Gave me chills. I love the banjo, it adds a lot of character to the song :)
---
When the GW2 API (application program interface) is down, think of it sort of like an official skills/trait reference point, anything that interconnects with it will experience issues like this.
---
All that from one source image? Talented!
---
Actually, Jahai was my fastest 250 (starting from 0) 9 alts got me 180 per day, plus another 5 rifts per character, I finished within 3 hours.  
---
It also has the easiest hearts.
---
ZOMG! Imagine next April Fool's where all world bosses become stick figures!  xD
---
It really depends on if $13 is a significant portion of your entertainment budget.
---
If it is, then wait as long as you can/until a sale (whichever comes first).
---
If it isn't, then I would recommend buying once you know you'll be playing long-term. Two-and-a-half months of log-in rewards and no restrictions is worth something.
---
Leveling is pretty flat, so you should continue gaining levels at about the same speed (1-10 is faster, but 20-80 is fairly consistent).
---
Honestly, you'll be fine whatever you do.  There's no rush - the content isn't going anywhere and it's best to enjoy it at your own pace.
---
You've already figured out the biggest secret:  play it like Skyrim, stopping to smell the roses, organically exploring, following NPCs, and jumping into events as you see them.
---
And fuck that nearby rude-ass branded spire spitting pink shit at everyone constantly!
---
I never been in raids. But i have question for you guys that are raiding... Does one need to play a lot of raids to get enough of currency to get Dhuum helmet and shoulders? And, are you getting currency even if you dont finish raid successfully?
---
Thanks in advance. &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm doing Inscribed Shards LAST because Kourna is just the worst. Here thEy are - starving! - in a zone full of Moa, fish, and other game and they want to eat tasteless roots and rats? And definitely send the Commander out to procure those rats. What would Kourna be like if the commander didn‚Äôt flatten at least one rat with a roller beetle? Oh and speaking of those tasteless roots, you know all those Ilboga I killed to get them? In the original Guild Wars, ilboga could go in a salad. That shit is food. So maybe go vegetarian if you want. Also, people of Kourna, pleas consider how best to use the commander‚Äôs time. Maybe have a moa steak, nourish yourselves, and go burn your own infected crops. The commander can‚Äôt chew your tasteless roots for you.
---
yeah I got all 11 alts sitting at that heart so I just need 5 more to do a second heart. probably the corsair one to break up fights
---
Thought this would be about how queue is broken at the moment.

That would make the movement feel a lot more satisfying, I would welcome this change. I would also like it if flying higher than your canopy was more forgiving and didn't force you to descend so suddenly. The griffon is already such a powerful and capable mount, I don't see a problem with giving the Skyscale a bit more freedom in movement.

Underrated piece of art ^_^

I'm not saying that you can't be productive on mind altering substances, I'm just saying that a person is relying on something like that, they should at least consider seeking some counseling to help them be ok sober as well.
---
The brain chemistry thing may very well just be an excuse the person uses to justify an unhealthy habit, and the right counselor can help them determine that more objectively.
---
No it has amazing artwork, you're mistaking the 2. The graphic quality itself is actually quite low largely because its still a DX9 game..
---
preach!

&gt;Every shout give 2 might for 10 people (+3 from fire shout) and +3 before double it with 4 in warhorn. You can overload in Fire too to get some.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Me, I use septer to more blast (fury if you have to play fire trait for aura clean) but you can cover
---
There is plenty of might from 5 shouts, fireoverload, 2 blasts, fire 4 and earth 4. You will almost always also have excess might or might uptime from necro, chrono, guardian, etc.
---
To add onto this, you could try your luck with farming quartz nodes. They have a chance to drop a charged one (though it is rare drop, so would suggest boosting rare drop chance).

I wouldn't generalize on terrain navigation difficulty.
---
Because of how the Springer mechanically works, it is much easier to use. You only have to think about your limited horizontal reach, then its just press button, release button, or wait till the Springer jumps on its own.
---
The Skyscale on the other hand has a higher skill floor and ceiling if you actually want to be more effective - had i climbed Thunderhead Peak just by pressing spacebar, it'd have taken me forever. It is mechanically more complex, requires more attention.
---
But yes, the use territory of the Springer is quite a bit smaller now, because even small amounts of horizontal movements play into the Skyscale's claws.
---
Yes. I saw your well-crafted thread and the lack of understanding of nuance of people who read it just overwhelmed me. People are so obsessed about results that they forget that control is a factor. It's like the Raptor vs Jackal or Renegade vs Herald argument.
---
I don't see a problem, you hit 80 way before finishing all currently available sub-80 zones.
---
Story-wise it makes sense to keep adding 80 zones: it assumes you have finished the level 80 personal story and there for won't need to go back to pre-80 zones. 
---
What benefit will there be to adding sub-80 zones?
---
Statistically speaking, it's extremely improbable that you're the only one...
---
This was known before the episode released.
---
So you are complaining that level 80 expansion content has no low level zones?
---
While it's entirely unlikely that we'll ever get that Aurene mount skin I've been dreaming of for so long, especially now that our baby girl is a fully-ascended Elder Dragon, I really do hope that we'll get a skin like that Crystal Dragon spawn linked above. 
---
It would be nice to have a skin that gives us some kind of connection to our favorite crystal hatchling.
---
Also, it's cool that they wanted the Skyscale to be a wall-jumping focused flight mount, but they should really tweak it's jump mechanic to be a bit faster and more fluid. The whole "snapping to the wall" animation is a bit clunky and ruins the speed and flow of the mount since it forces you to be rooted to a single point on a wall until you charge the jump and leap away.
---
If it were changed so that the wall-leap had a huge range, possibly thanks to the Skyscale using its wings to launch itself, it would be a lot more fun as a wall-bouncing/gliding/flying mount.
---
Yeah objectively speaking the graphical quality isn't anything amazing but the colorful artstyle and great environmental design make it still hold up despite the dated engine
---
Just wish it had better performance!!!!
---
I only got 1 character with such a connection. It's a long write every time I explain it, but fortunately I did it recently, so I can copypaste. Here you go.
---
&gt; My male human elementalist doesn't know how old he is.  
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Back before the Searing, he literally fell from the sky over a flame legion squad, right as they were about to slaughter a small settlement that was evacuating to south of the Great Wall. He miraculously survived the fall, and killed a few of them with his weight, in the chaos that ensued, he stood up and defeated the surviving charr while dazed and confused.  
---
&gt; He was badly hurt in the fall, and lost consciousness after the fight.  When he came to, he could not remember much before the fall, and just a little of the fight.  
---
&gt; He joined the villagers and helped them get safely to the south while recovering. Not knowing what else he could do, he decided to go with the suggestion of one of the villagers and travel to Ascalon City to join the fight against the charr. He discovered there that he had a natural ability for elemental magic, and was trained as an elementalist.  
---
&gt; He survived the Searing, traveled with Ascalon refugees to Kryta, discovered the truth about the White Mantle, ascendended, defeated the Undead Lich, became Weh No Su, cleansed Kuunavang, defeated Shiro, joined the Sunspears, reclaimed an ancient Shrine of Melandru for the Sunspears, help them rebuild their army and take the fight to Kourna, defeated Varesh, and destroyed Abaddon so Kormir could sacrifice herlsef to contain his power.  
---
&gt; After that he traveled to the north and rallied 3 armies and a bunch of norn to keep the Great Destroyer from awakening Primordus early, helped Gwen find love, culled the Mursaat threat until there was only a single sneaky survivor, and wiped all remaining Awakened from Cantha.  
---
&gt; And then, finally,  a moment of peace. He had been so busy for so long that he had never time to stop and think where he came from. So he started searching. Elona. Cantha. The North. The Charr homelands. Forgotten ruins. Rumors. Leads dig by the Whispers... he could not find anything, and by the time he realized, he had been traveling the world for decades without finding anything, and the dragons rose. After the troubles, when the dust settled, he realized that he had lived for over 250 years. He looked human, but was he really human?  Over the years his faced has changed a little, and he had gained a bit of height, but other than that he didn't look like he aged a single day.  His own origin was the only mystery he could never solve.  
---
&gt; In these times of danger and uncertainty, people would fear the unknown more than ever. Humanity barely remembered the hero of Nightfall. He was probably considered dead. He though it would be safer to keep it that way, at least until he finally learned where he came from, what he really was. 
---
&gt; A few bribes here and there, and in paper he was an orphan adopted by a noble.  He had now the identity of child who had lost his parents, and then lost his life in a centaur raid before he could even walk.  
---
&gt; He could now move from Lion's Arch to Divinity's Reach and use the city as a base of operations continue his research to the North and to the West, to Janthir and far beyond Maguuma.
---
&gt; He packed his things and left through the south door, only to find Shaemoor under attack.  
---
&gt; Ah, shit. Here we go again.
---
&gt; His next trip would have to be delayed. But it's not like that's much of a problem for someone who doesn't seem to age. He'd solve the current crisis before continuing his research. After it's easier to find information when the world isn't a pile of rubble and ashes.
---
We don't talk about that mocap shoot anymore.
---
Upvoted so people see temp fix.
---
Oh. Dammit. Now I'll have to watch it on a loop for an hour again to get it the earworm out of my head.
---
Stupid distracting catchy song.
---
I don't think that's as common a phobia as arachnophobia, nor is it triggered by magical sand-jackal golems.
---
I'd love to see the sand puppers and skyscales roughing around!
---
I wonder if the idea is Aurene is able to filter out the magic or reflect (similar to how Spencer the Chak organ was used to filter out magic / explain magic exists on a spectrum). Did the gods arrive and upset the system handling it there own way, handing out magic?  Humans using different schools of magic associated with specific gods, the gods being vessels to help distribute this.  
---
Instead of hoarding the magic, we are to share the magic equally though, keeping it in a constant flux. Having Aurene as the main filter but also having champions to take the share out the damage (as shown in the glints trials). We sit in an ring while she communes, and he take the damage.  
---
Maybe we can also look into the abilitity to reshape crystal structures. Harmonising with the light and reforming the crystals (Nice touch by Anet that these crystals turn into tuning forks). That vision in Kesho does seem to show the different nodes in constant movement.  
---
Teh elder dragons don't have scions to help cleanse them properly and end up hoarding conflicting magics rather than sharing them out.  
---
I definitly think the skyscale collections were somehow trying to describe the different levels of magic.
---
Aurene has a theme song called Aurene - Dragon of Light. We also mentioned stuff about magic working like a light spectrum with that whole Taimi and the chak organ thing
