That is the stupidest thing I've read all week. And I've read a lot of stupid stuff this week.
---
Overall... Good job not understanding the *core* gameplay ideas of GW2 since launch. But hey, I'm sure turning this entire game into a pvp shitfest is a really great idea.
---
Yep! 
---
Or heck, just any experienced player against those less experience. The idea of making PoF/HoT maps Open World PvP would basically mean any new players that, gasp, *don't* like PvP (I know, really tough concept!) would really hesitate to spend money on the major expansions (== money for ArenaNet) of the game.
---
It's one reason I keep coming back! I love the dye system so much
---
I don't think it'd be berry enjoyable.
---
&gt;I’d be fine with opt-in open world duels, so long as they had an “Ignore This User” button to avoid trolls.
---
Yeh, a dueling system ("Bob wants to fight you. Accept?") would be... tolerable, but only as long as you could ignore people *and* turn it off (i.e., set to "I'm peaceful!").
---
even tho we had that stuff in gw1 already, i really would like to see the realm of torment once again with the domain of anguish as elite raid / area which is more open then the tube level raids we have now.  
---
the realm of torment would bring some neat new areas with itself, no more snowy mountains, cliffs, deserts or wood / dungle areas...no dark red, grey with big thorns / spikes and strange creatures.  
---
and a tiny bit of purple (not the area). because margonites are fucking awesome.
---
I’m so glad you like it! I love representing differing sexualities and genders in my characters and their stories, and a transgender Svanir seemed like a really interesting take. Might use it for another character, actually.
---
Yes it's kind of disappointing to be honest. I feel like there are so many human swords which would have
---
been a better fit.
---
No, both are the same. DX9 -&gt; &lt;api&gt; -&gt; card.
---
That there could be a reinterpretation of Shining blade attire. It does seem to have the aesthetic, and especially if it's a human.

---
If you are from the EU I full heartedly can recommend Crossroads. Super friendly, active and pretty much guranteed Boss kills.
---
The hacker isn't running smoothly because they're using the teleporting hack. That's what it looks like
---
People have been doing it in WvW since the game's launch.  Even if you luckily spike them down, they can port while downed.  They will just get out of range, full res, and come back.  There is no shame as some of them will do it for hours on end and for months at a time.
---
I read somewhere that in pve Minstrels Firebrand outdoes harrier's because they convert vitality to healing from force of will. Is this correct? Is it worth the trade-off from symbol healing?
---
wow your shrill shrieking really convinced me of the error of my ways
---
&gt;Mobile Gaming is the future that's a fact and no one can ignore this.
---
Until the power of a gaming-tier rig can fit in a handheld, and handheld controls don't cramp my stubby little fingers after more than a couple hours, it will not.
---
Sadly he is more likely to get action taken by doing what he is doing here because unless allot of people see it and demand stuff gets done they tend to put it off till much later if at all.
---
See, and raids are my least favorite content and I love the open world. The issue is you want to get what you want from the open world on your time schedule. It frustrates you more because you don't like it. But in reality from the point of view of someone who spends most of his time in the open world, I don't have a problem with most of it. 
---
Maybe you just need a couple of friends. We get five guys, look in the skritt burglar locations, one person finds it like a scavenger hunt and we kill it.
---
I'm not there in the open world waiting for one event. I'm there playing the open world, doing the events when they come up.
---
On the other hand the preparation for raids turns me off, and is just as boring to me.  
---
Exploration is least frustrating when you do it organically, specifically with a couple of friends.  Which is how I do it.
---
Ooh ok. That might explain it. Thanks! :)
---
1. Condi cleanse
---
2. There's a lot of different events to choose from. No need to idly wait.
---
3. Most of the time people will join to help from map chat, or in emergencies from LA/LFG
---
4. My biggest problem with skritt chests is the trolls who open them before you're ready. Maybe require at least 2 people to open it?
---
5. Stealth says hi. 
---
6. Yeah, that is bullshit.
---
That being said, I am all for improving the mechanics/enjoyability of open world content.
---
&gt; 6.Griffons, harpies, and other mobs that evade/block for 5 seconds with no way to counter them. Uhm, what am I supposed to learn from this mechanic as a player? Why don't these mobs teach players to CC/interrupt instead of just waiting?
---
just thinking about this makes my blood pressure rise
---
I do think its odd Anet thinks roamers add more to the game than being able to enjoy moving around without fighting someone tailored to 1v1.
---
You forgot number 7: Events needed for XYZ item that run at the exact same time as a map meta, and require more than 1 person to do. It's pretty much a struggle to get one other person to join you, yet alone a group. And a call in map chat is often met with people stating they're doing the meta (and in my experience, it's usually people being rude about it, whereas someone else could make a call and they'd be like "Got a meta going on, apologies")
---
Yeah, I do spot really cool fashion in-game, I think the most popular ones I see these days are those "realistic" looking ones, not your oversized cauldrons with Christmas lights, but the kind of armor you'd expect someone to realistically wear in a medieval setting.
---
And of course as with every MMO... the sexy mogs as well.
---
What's it like being an avocado? Do you have vegetable fiends trying to get you into their guac?
---
Interesting! Thanks! Though the way I see the grawl I'd never thinknof them as owners of Ascalon. During gw 1 they were even more primative than current times so even further back when charr themselves were a primative, tribal race  the grawl were probably just beasts with a very simple mind, much like current skales.
---
I love open world because it is the "relaxing" aspect of this game - as compared to the other game modes. I just put on a show on netflix and hop and run around and do events and gather material/currency. 
---
I spend all day playing with other players, raids, fractals, dungeons, wvw, pvp, world bosses, meta events, HP trains etc. etc. 
---
Do i really need to squad up to gather some mistonium or finish a map completion?
---
I will admit that sometimes when I get into combat in some place for some stupid reason I'll just log out to character select and log back in to avoid all the hassle. But what would you do? Remove the combat loss speed thing?
---
Thank the fucking heavens. Now quit the damn game.
---
Well do you think why they make that? Imagine gathering material for once, make it easier or unguarded and how much more inflated the price will be? Materials wont have value
---
I see that as Anet giving tough love for the game because they dont want the game destroyed
---
But i can see some points of yours is true too
---
As someone who occasionally drops into WvW, I find it frustrating keeping up with a zerg when tag and most of the zerg have warclaw. By the time you get to a fight it's already won or lost.
---
Charr are my favorite race, so I'd love for the next expac to focus on them. Maybe anet will give them some love. Probably not, but...
---
Mounts ended up being just an anti-gank measure. And I don't say it as a good thing tbh
---
I swear opening the map in PoF areas causes a sand eel to spawn and bite you.
---
My favorite and most frequently played GW2 mini-game: "WHY AM I STILL IN COMBAT!???"
---
Fashion is my favorite part of the game
---
Wiki about WvW-Territories:
---
&gt; While within that border, players from the capturing team will be able to Glide (provided they have the first rank in War Gliding Mastery) and their Warclaw will run faster (provided they have the second rank in Warclaw Mastery).
---
So if you are playing in the blue team and are trying to run away from multiple players of green while being in a territory owned by green then they will be able to catch up with you (as long as they have the mastery).
---
Welp, TIL
---
Having a friend is squadding up? lol k then
---
No I can run around the open world without squading up, but then if I'm not trying to do specific stuff like the skritt burglar which is one tiny percentage of PvE. It's an exceptional example. But it's still easily doable with 2-3 people, which isn't squadding up in my book. And if you're not doing one of a few collections, you don't need the caffeinated skritt burglar anyway. 
---
The point is, if you play organically there's a ton of stuff to do in the open world. If I run into an event I can't do solo I either go to another event, or I pop a mentor tag, call it out in map chat and generally someone comes. 
---
It's only a problem because you don't like it. It's the easiest part of the game. Imagine a raider complaining that they  have to squad up for basic PvE stuff. lol
---
No, it's not just you. People often mistake bad game design for "difficult" game design, they think that just because an enemy gets knockdown attacks, is immune to CC and is incredibly frustrating to fight, it's difficult and therefore good game design. They're wrong. Good game design is where an enemy is actually difficult to beat *but* the better you get at the game, the easier it will be to defeat that enemy. With GW2 there is basically a cap on how much your skill will matter, you only get so many dodges to use and no matter how skilled you are you just have to run away sometimes and wait for your dodge bar to replenish, it's pretty much time gating fights lol
---
The PvP in this game is actually quite good. I would recommend giving it a go. For as long as I've played PvP, I've never seen a hacker as obvious as this one.
---
that one enemy that you ran past a mile back and has gone back to the non combat animation and behaviour yet you are still in combat with it somehow, so fucking annoying.
---
I pugged to static to full clears. Thats how people learn raiding, they wait for training runs for the first kp
---
It’s not just the hacker, sadly. It sounds like the attitude can be super toxic, and given that I’m not a super good player (though I am improving), my concern would be getting a bunch of awful feedback and getting beaten down by it all. The solution’s clearly a thicker-skin, but it’s still sad, that there is so much that goes against PVP being a welcoming game zone.
---
No one had dhuum kp on launch in pugs. I pugged early dhuum that entire week and there were serious sellers who didnt clear till next week. Fyi i have all raid cms but 7 and i have full cleared that and air cm. This week earth.
---
I love my condi necro. So much fun and totally invincible
---
Why is this down voted? The game is so alt friendly good groups do meta comps per boss. We even swap chrono to qb and rev on power.
---
And the mount gets 4 skills now.
---
But having the 5th slop empty is kind of ugly. They should give them a 5th. 
---
What could be the 5th? One to grab an ally and carry it around, for players who have no mounts?
---
For me the answer is usually that my pet acts like an npc in the pokemon games and if it catches literally anything looking at it the fight is ON
---
But the hackers are the gift that keeps on giving!  Ban and they rebuy the game!
---
For starters, takes less time to OOC. For conditions, there needs to be an intermediate state, out of combat but without the movement speed buff that makes conditions cleanse faster so you don't spend 30 seconds limping after you've killed the mobs. 
---
Movement impairing conditions shouldn't be available for trash mobs either. veterans, elites, and champs should be able to stun and slow me down but why is a random jacaranda or iboga able to CC me? There is no challenge or reward for killing a random mob other than to get yourself out of combat faster so you can go back to doing your task - that's just boring and frustrating.
---
Actually that one is weird because most of the ones that have anything guarding is are not worth bothering with. Like "oh hey there is a vet guarding a rich gold node" but why the hell are you even trying to mine that?
---
After reading through these commemts I am so relieved. I thought I was just terrible at the game, like I was missing something... but nope it sounds like that’s just the game’s design. I love the game, the environments, everything, but when I started getting heated while trying to do “relaxing” content that’s not good.
---
Domination is only use if you need Boonstrip and/or you're playing with GS. 
---
Illusion is the main traitline along with Duelist and Chrono.
---
im usually in combat until any debuffs or buffs fall off that i got while i was in combat. its annoying.
---
Immediate reaction: hate it.
---
The constant negativity is what gets me. Maybe 1/10 matches were positive, 3/10 nobody talks until last second with something negative even if winning, and the rest were constant bitching throughout. I'm just a guy with a shitty computer who wants to play other game modes for rewards, but don't know if it's worth
---
Warclaw makes holding a choke point useless since you can triple dodge through it. 50 people inside sm? just mount up and get in. 0 counter. Sadly they already released paid skins so it's not like they can remove that mount now.
---
The goggle can be completely ignored ... there are more than enough points from other things.
---
For light armor, try the Archon coat paired with the Ascalonian dungeon legs :)
---
I feel confident they aren’t dealing with national security secrets, so maybe an anonymous tip on reddit isn’t such a horrible ask.  ;)
---
&gt; My biggest problem with skritt chests is the trolls who open them before you're ready. Maybe require at least 2 people to open it?
---
Why? It's easily soloable if you are prepared/on the right build.
---
When you try and waypoint but then that *one random bog skale* comes out of nowhere, so you have to close your world map, autoattack for three seconds, then go find that waypoint again.
---
Wanna list a build/class/anything? In my experience berserker is used in most situations because many builds have passives/skills that increase their precision up to the cap already.
---
Yes!! I just want to be able to explore the pretty parts of Dragonfall without dismounting and fighting every two seconds :(
---
I understand it's about making us wait to spam skills until the time is right, but it really doesn't make it any less infuriating.
---
This doesn't work for me and it just zooms in.
---
Wait, do all classes have easy access to that??
---
Is it even possible to air overload without wiggling around?
---
It’s almost like you are sparkling like a loot bag that hasn’t been picked up. Remember the days before auto loot and having to walk around and pick up bags? You’re a walking loot sack.
---
NDAs are taken very seriously by any company

For power chrono (which you only mentioned by saying the traits lol) check [SC for raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) and [dT for fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer). Make sure you swap to the domi build on SC. If the API isn't working I can also generate a build link just remember that with the mastery and potions you're getting extra precision in fractals.
---
I noticed these things as well and they are annoyances to me. But I don’t think to the level as some of you which seems to make you torment in seething rage. 
---
For me to avoid combat I spam mount key hard or I bring some invincible spells (blocks, aegis, evade, condo clear) in my utilities so I can either clear fast or get out of that place to a clear area fast. 
---
I noticed skyscale is great too so many ground monsters can’t hit you. I hope that helps you and let your anger calm down haha. We feel you!
---
Yup, they fixed that achievement.
---
they have to compensate for absolutely vegetable AI that look like theyre struggling to breathe and function even when theyre winning. fighting in this game will never be better than the AI, only as good or worse

The wiki has a [walkthrough](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Saving_Skyscales#Walkthrough) but if you're referring to the water, fire, earth, and air eggs (step 6) they all need you to talk to the Djinn that spawn there. Just talk with [Grandmaster Elder Djinn Emine](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Elder_Djinn_Emine) (no need to do the event).
---
Lmao he deleted all his comments
---
Nope. They’re super common, and most players don’t care.
---
What do I want from a third expac?
---
**Scarlet's War: Remake**
---
(Yeah I did just watch WP's video. He's right. That missing content is a big flaw in the game)
---
I haven't went out of my way to actually fight many of these griffins, but AFAIK theres no easy way to tell when they make the transition from regular mob to hacking the matrix. If they had an interruptable animation before going to another dimension they'd be much less frustrating
---
Iirc you should only need 3/4-ish of the bar charged to hit the ship.
---
Alternately you could swim up to the ship and hit it unless that's been changed recently
---
Check [snowcrows.com](snowcrows.com) for all of the best raid builds. You can use them for solo play in casual pve as well.
---
Your builds are definitely out of date, as expansions brought elite specializations which introduces new class mechanics after applying the elite spec trait line. They are usually more powerful due to power creep.
---
You want power dps for fractals and most raids. The best builds are: power weaver, power soulbeast, power dragonhunter, power daredevil, and power holosmith.
---
For story, these and power reaper are all good choices.
---
Try to follow all traits, skills, and weapons, while using exotic berserker stat (+ power + percision +ferocity) gear will do you great. Picking up ascended trinkets from living world maps bitterfrost frontier and dragonfall will get you a big boost in stats as well. Feel free to adapt the build to your wants and needs as well.
---
Remember higher dps will mean higher survivability, as enemies have less time to deal damage to you. So always try to prioritize getting better dps when having trouble surviving.
---
Some raid bosses will favor condi dps. The 2 best condi builds are condi mirage and condi renegade, with other options including condi daredevil, holosmith, soulbeast, firebrand, and berserker. Mirage is the best on almost all the condi bosses though, so every other option is objectively worse, though viable.
---
If there is a specific class that catches your eye on the website, a specific playstyle you want, difficulty of rotations, I can go more in depth on a specific build, but the website guides should mostly cover them in depth.
---
I’m not that experienced with wvw, but here is what I know.
---
Make sure your friends are on the same server as you, as you can only play with those on your server. Choose an active server for your time zone [here](https://wvwstats.com/timezones), though be aware that active servers switch with server links, so the server you choose may go dead the next server link change.
---
Small groups with your friends will require nice composition in order to compete with other small groups or larger groups. You will most likely need expansions for elite specs and ascended gear to compete with other player’s builds. Maurader gear for dps and minstrel for supports for the vitality. Firebrand support is really good for small fights, with spellbreaker being a solid dps spec. That’s the extent of my wvw knowledge, but I do know cleave, healing, and condi cleanse are all crucial to be successful. Wvw allows for lots of custom brewed builds, so get creative and experiment what works!
---

there is a witch-hunting rule?

I’ll try that next because the trebuchet did not work either time.

I’ll try to melee it. Trebuchet simply doesn’t want to work

---
FLOCK TO ME!
---
Before, it was for them to get an idea how HoT played for people who hadn't touched the game in at least 6 months.  Maybe this is something big they have planned?  Surely they wouldn't just need random people to come in and test normal content.
---
Heads up: sorry for the wall of text
---
You're right, I'm an achiever. And if there's one thing I hate about this game, it's that I can only finish achievements and collections based on the game's time, not mine!
---
Lets take Ziya the Radiant as an example. You need her to start her escort mission so you can kill the branded djinn so you can start your requiem armor collection. But I can't just go up to her spawn point and start the escort! I have to wait until she is ready! So i just wait, for 10-15 minutes until she pops up. I can't leave the area to do something else... because then I might miss it! So i'm just stuck wasting time! World bosses and meta events have a predictable timer, which is great! but for small events like escorting ziya, shouldn't we be able to have control over that? Since it doesn't effect the overall meta of the map...
---
Another example is skritt! You need them for specialization collections, right? They're fairly easy to kill with just 2-3 people. The only hard part is actually finding a damn chest. And it all depends on random luck because there's five maps with five possible spawns. and there's a random timegate as well! so you could be running around checking every spawn spot and still wouldn't find it because someone just recently killed it and didn't announce it in chat! 
---
If event/mob is tied to an achievement/collection, why can't we track them or start the event from our achievement panel? Double click the empty achievement box in the proper location to start an event! or make it so that you have your own skritt chest that people can help you with once you start it. 
---
or double clicking it will give you a message that says "X will spawn in 8 minutes and 2 seconds... "
---
what if it's on CD from the 3 other ibogas? That's the issue... every mob has access to condis so you can't possibly cleanse it all
---
&gt; I've never experienced truly extreme range on aggro;
---
I guess you never stood more than 3s near a jacaranda, or several of the forged enemies.
---
Pretending Anet has cared about lore and skins for the past few LW launches...
---
All the Karma skins from heart vendors so you don't waste your guaranteed wardrobe/armor/weapon unlocks on easily obtainable skins.
---
&gt; ...more than what your normal movement and stamina would allow you to reasonably avoid.
---
I know its not the first thing thought of but just walking out of aoes or otherwise always be moving so aoes miss goes a long way in this game. The best example of this i can think of is fire hydras, that meteor attack wrecks your shit but if you are already moving (no swiftness or anything) the meteor will land behind you and you take zero dmg. Kiting is a legit strat to lessen the headache.
---
I feel better exploring on a mount honestly.
---
It’s like having a repeating invulnerability phase on a trash mob, it’s the most awful thing. The only thing worse than a griffon is an obstructed griffon.
---
Yepp, customer support in this game across the years has solved all of my problems I've ever had from reversing accidental laurel recipe purchases (twice, oops), converting soulbound items from deleted chars to acc bound, fixing acc not being able to purchase gems &amp; removing authenticator app since I lost my old number.
---
I've learned to just provide as much info as possible on the initial ticket to save getting asked questions to "provide x info" and having to wait hours/days for another response 9 times outta 10 they have all the stuff they need to verify and make the change on that initial inquiry.
---
&gt; ...tanky mount that won't die if an awakened just looked at it.
---
Like the bunny that can evade while charging up it jump? or the jackal where you gain distance and evade all in one? Perhaps you are looking for a mount that have 30k+ hp so you can run around while paying less attention to your surroundings.
---
You kill them before you remove the conditions but it's simpler to run by with a mount or just skip PoF most of the time. Not like it offers anything good.
---
Wow, is there a reason the rocks form in that near hexagonal pattern, or is it manmade?
---
Enemy servers *heavy breathing*
---
I find this interesting , I wonder what they would need an outside player , and physical location playtest on , this far into the game life ? 
---
On a side note , anyone interested in actually being a video game playtester as a job , everyone hates it and says don't waste your time cause you'll hate your life.
---
&gt; 2-3 shot the skyscale

Eeeegh. Not looking forward to that.

I'm running Cinnamon, so I will see if there is some equivalent to KDE's cursor locator.
---
I have the same alt-tab problem, but in light of this thread I spoke to one of my friends, who also plays on Linux. He says he does not have this problem, but I haven't been able to thoroughly diff our configs yet. Maybe its a distri or desktop env dependent thing? He is running Arch IIRC.
---
It's not the hp, it's that mounts have barely any armor. Obviously Bond of Vigor + Jackal jump spam makes this inconsequential for the most part, but it's still aggravating how much your mounts are made of paper when you're not dodging.
---
Mai Trin Fractal in a nutshell. There's a reason I'll always have a Sigil of Energy on every weapon set for that place.
---
i feel like this isn’t how it should be done for pvp
---
And? My point was simply that both are correct.
---
I am excited about dragon bash because I missed it the first time around.  
---
I miss old Lions arch.  
---
I am excited to see a festival in Hoelbrak!
---
 these statements have existed without influencing each other.
---
Not sure if troll but I hope so
---
Can confirm.
---
I wished I had only half the blocks/evades/mobility other classes have. Necro is by far the easiest to kill because of that.
---
afaik mounts are supposed to augment our movement around a map. Think back to before mounts how everyone had to use the utilities and weapons that gave swiftness or skills like bulls rush, leap, shadow step etc Mounts were the answer to that problem. Having them not be tanky beasts that can run thru mobs with out a care is not a good thing imo. Mounts are already immune to all forms of hard and soft CC, them having a limited hp pool separate from my characters hp pool is while having the ability to evade attacks on command is excellent compromise imo.
---
It's funny, because this problem has already cost them money.
---
I still stand by my view that, even since GW1, A.Net does easy or moderately challenging content well. When they aim for difficult content, they fuck it up: they end up making annoying content instead.
---
That is why something like FoW was always my favourite end-game dungeon: it was the easiest of them all, and I think the simplicity of it prevented them to fuck it up.
---
It is also why some of the core starter maps are among my favourite GW2 content.
---
Camouflage skill. Last 5 seconds, but you cant move.
---
the idea in the mai trin fractal is to avoid aoes by positioning, thats why they all have big windups so you can walk out
---
I'm legit laughing at the mental image of the protagonist getting frustrated at the trebutchet:
---
"Fuck this shit"
---
*swims to the ship and sinks it by hacking it to pieces with his sword*
---
No but you might be if you are that easily distracted.
---
I know people want Cantha but if Afflicted are still around you're going to be crying. Heavy damage dealers, big aggro range, AND they explode on death. 😂 You'll never map travel again when you have 12 stacks of weakness and poison with 15-20 seconds of duration from that mob of Afflicted before another mob spawns. 
---
Seriously though, I did map completion by making a set of Nomad armor and accessories and using speed boosts &amp; anything to reduce/remove debuffs. I was slow because I sucked at vistas and mounts weren't a thing back then. Map completion is cool and all but there are dead ends that are filled with bad guys and that's no bueno.
---
That is metal? 
---
Also, I was on the receiving end of your chain teleport bombs... They hurt. ^ANETplznerf
---
I broadly agree with you.  And I know the main reason half the enemies in the open world have batshit crazy outgoing damage and armor  ("Veteran" mobs with more HP and outgoing damage than Legendary Dungeon Boss anyone?) is mainly to counteract a swarm of overgeared players turning them into paste in less than one cooldown.  But it's still infuriating.  And terrible game design.  (If you can't figure out a better way to make an enemy difficult than to make it immune to CC and go invulnerable 80% of the time, please go play a better game.)
---
As far as getting people for events goes, I've learned the the single most helpful thing you can have as an open-world PvE'er is a commander tag.  It is *amazing* how much you can scream in map chat for hours with a mentor tag for help with an event and get nothing.  Do the exact same thing with the Dorito of Instant Help™ and you get a full squad in about 20 seconds.
---
Yeesh
---
Violating an NDA doesn't help anyone, not even us. People start setting impossible standards and speculate wildly with little information that can change at a moment's notice, hence the testing

---
&gt;Your average casual player will probably burn out before they even get to a single legendary.

"I am casual player, and I wanna wield legendary sword."

But you are casual player after all. Some may want raid title, or PvP crown. Its all require extra effort.

I’m new to pvp. What are you showing us here? I don’t get it.

It feels like the cannons are "kinda" trying to shoot you, so the patterns are not regular. Bonus: flux bomb, enemies explode, sugar rush (so everything attacks even faster) and the rest of pugs ignore that shithead deadeye npc that can one-shot anyone without clear telegraph in this visual bukkake.
---
Hackers don't get banned but if you say something "offensive" you get instantly banned
---
So dont take it &gt;\_&gt;
---
Its a **survey**, its optional. But nooo, you opted to be edgy...
---
Its not a mandatory test, you moistened bint 
---
You're acting like Anet is asking for your card info and SS number. Over here acting like a ranch boy who just discovered the internet, the fuck.
---
But but... didn't we all LOVE golem week, repair hammers, portable cannons etc....
---
We lOvEd all these changes!!!! :'D
---
Indeed, you can this one falling during their first frames on the screen :)
---
Yes, a casual player who has maintained a schedule of playing daily through 70 hour work weeks and terribly bad health for 3 weeks straight because he wanted to whine about not being handed something.
---
I'm not complaining about the legendary collections. I'm talking about Mystic Tribute being a terrible game design.
---
What is this 'fix' thing? I'm not sure that exists in the GW2 world...
---
This is a bad change.
---
I’ve seen lots of candy corn nodes in Orr, hilariously.
---
As long as some people agree that Mystic Tribute is bad.
---
Afair coins were dirt cheap when they were put into the daily completion bag. Since HoT or so they were changed to spirit shard
---
And onto how to get them :
---
- Kill the ley anomaly to get a daily coin
---
- Do daily music forger if it's up
---
- Do 100/99 cm Fractal to have a chance on coins (or do all dailies to have a even bigger chance on a coin).
---
[Issues with the render server](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/947659#Comment_947659). You can edit the html style with 
---
    .gw2a--2_r-a { border: 4px solid white; }
---
and disable the border in ".gw2a---rxe-" OR just tell me what build you're looking at and I'll generate a build link. If these sites stored the images or used another source (wiki/gw2treasures) this wouldn't be as much of an issue.
---
I had to do that at the Rich Iron Node in Harathi Hinterlands. The ghosts had somehow managed to get vulnerability on me with a duration of 1 day 6 hours. :(
---
And that's where the problem lies. You're getting 1 per day. But the rest are a crapshoot. Which is not how it should be. I should be able to get the item I want in multiple different ways.
---
Pressing 5 now, sir
---
Lucky you, to me it's always a sand shark.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Was Ranked plat 1.
---
You dont have to apologize to me. Im just some jackass on the internet and just because thats what I took from your post/comments doesnt mean its accurate. 
---
I think what you said here "I've just come off a long week of PvE and I noticed a repeating pattern of not-so-fun experiences." is showing things in a extra negative light right now. Yes mobs aggro from further away in PoF but thats because mount are a thing and if mobs didnt then you could just run thru a forged camp and never get hit because by the time the mobs noticed you, you would be past them and out of range to attack already. Yes there are alot more conditions in PoF but you have many ways (more than one per class) to remove/counter conditions. I too have been put out by having to wait for X event to spawn for X achievement but thats part of the ap hunting process you want to get that AP right now you gotta put inthe time to get it and if waiting for a event to re-start is part of that so be it. Its a MMO and not everything can operate on my schedule or in a way that favours me over everyone else all the time.
---
This sounds too much like patiently working towards long term goals. :P
---
I'm using your estimations. I honestly wouldn't know, I don't buy coins, and I have enough for my projects right now. 
---
Regardless, 4 gold per day with relatively simple tasks should give you something to work with, and won't kill you with boredom too much.
---
The anomaly event gives more than the login. Login gives ~0.7 a day.
---
There's enemies everywhere these days. It's like a war zone. I want more safs spots.
---
target the necro meta &gt;\_&lt;
---
Yeah I don't contest that either. They'll probably transition over to Guild Wars Eternal or something. But as of now, this MMO has a better storyline than most other MMOs out there. Destiny 2 is a good contender (fingers crossed for Shadowkeep to be good)
---
Not you in particular, just in general. Rushing through any legendary is just a great way to get burnt out on the game. I'm working on three legendaries at the moment and I'm just casually collecting materials and doing what I usually do.
---
MATRIARCH TAKE YOU
---
You know that's not true, or did you forget suck at love?
---
Number 3 so much. Because of my timezone and work schedule I'm constantly fighting this. I've had to abandon many objectives I'd like to do because achievement tied events requiring a minimum number of players to complete.
---
TIL, thanks!
---
Since PoF, due to old hardware I was unable to play seriously, just some dailies, roaming in WvW in offhours. Eventually, I got enough of timegated stuff to never care about it. But, I was under impression that players with access to stuff like Istan would be in much better spot, than I, resource wise. 
---
Was I wrong?
---
There was 3-4 months delay between release of each legendary, isnt dailies alone would cover most of mystic coins needs?
---
Played vs the same guy some months ago already. The good thing is, its only a "speed hack" nothing else. So he is not stornger then he schould be. Easy win :D
---
&gt;Events that only happen once every two hours and force you to just waste your timing waiting. 
---
I think this has been one of the greatest flaws of the game since day one. Dynamic &amp; meta events are a really neat idea and great addition to the game, but relying on them to be the "meat" of the game's content because of the decision to oust "quests" from the game was a critical mistake. Particularly now since with collections we've got the concept of quests back, just implemented poorly.
---
Events should be a supplement, not the meal.
---
That makes sense. Imagine the buggiest game you have ever played. Now imagine playing something worse daily and you can't stop because it's your job ...
---
Yes, it “snaps” to full power. I can try doing it a little less I guess... just keep trying...
---
that has it's advantadges in combat since the necro class plays a lot with sending your own conditions to foes, but defintely out of combat is a burden. Something should be done about this. It has to be easy to fix this for OOC situations.
---
imagine being so starved for any news about game to ask people to break NDA. smh
---
Well, having multiple raid-ready classes/builds certainly is an advantage, but it is definitely not a necessary prerequisite. You can easily kill KC with a full condi squad, Largos twins can tolerate some power dps, and so on. Certain builds make certain bosses easier, but it's not a question of life and death if a raid newbie does not have all of that stuff.
---
the last 5 hot/pof sales i bought alt accounts, so i have every lvl60+ parked at vb flax farm and getting laurels and mystics coins by the boat load, i'm swimming in t6 mats and coins and more money than i care to spend right now.
---
i'm saving up for legendary armour i guess, i havent committed to the idea
---
Invest time to get good enough to sell raids and you make your legendary in a day after a new raid release :)
---
for a legy I'd need enough time to train for and then farm raids, which I don't have, and I'm 1900 levels away from the WvW. Ascended gear will do.
---
Every 28 days, without doing anything you can get :
---
* 20 mystic coins
---
* 7 mystic clovers (which reduce the amount of coin you'll need for the tribute by at least 7).
---
Every day you can get :
---
* One more from leyline anomaly
---
* A random amount between 0 and 24 from doing daily fractal CMs.
---
* A random amount between 0 and 3 from doing daily recommended fractals.
---
If we consider those activities to give 3 coins a day on average (not idea whether this is low or high), this is adding 84 coins every 28 days.
---
You mentionned crafting a tribute every season, which I'll consider to be 3 cycles of 28 days which would equate, if all mentionned dailies are done, to :
---
* 312 coins (bare minimum at 144)
---
* 21 clovers
---
The remaining amount of coins you would need to farm gold for would be far from overwhelming. If anything, the current rate of acquisition of coins compared to the amount required doesn't too atrocious : you need to invest a lot of gold only if you refuse to use the current methods of acquisition of if you're in a hurry and both of those reasons justify a steap cost IMO.
---
While I would not consider the anomaly very fun, it is easy open world so I would consider this relaxing. CMs can be a bit stressful but they are very fun when you are proficient at them. The main issue is the gatekeeping and learning process. All in all, IMO there are fun ways to farm coins and you're never really forced to farm gold for those and while I agree they could use a few more methods of acquisition, they don't justify such a rant.
---
I would like expansion three to do Cantha with a lot of side quests (just like in the first game).
---
The game has been doing story with a single narrative thread for way too long.
---
Your contribution to the discussion has been invaluable and we are so lucky, as a community, to have such intelligent players as yourself to give us new perspectives and ideas.
---
Re: 3 - Anet just recently adjusted Serpents Ire.  They've made other required content that was deemed too easy *harder*, but never dialed it back down after the rush passed.  A lot of content, especially LW map content, feels like it's balanced around the initial high-population rush.  A rework of the lowest tier of scaling could alleviate this issue game-wide.
---
Re: 5 - It's not just nodes; it feels like a good 80-90% of the interactables (nodes, chests) in the game are camped.  The designers clearly want you to clear then loot; the game for me is finding the class abilities or approaches to work around this.  If nodes are too obviously camped I just skip them; it's not worth the hassle if I have other priorities.
---
Re: 6 - I hate timegated enemies so much.  Use of CC to break the evade loop would be an interesting fix.
---
The most frustrating mechanic in this game for me is timed chest opening.  There's almost always an enemy nearby, and it always attacks you when the bar is 95% complete.  Unless you're a Guardian, then Aegis goes ***WIB!*** and you can actually open the thing and usually run off.
---
It's impossible to disengage from combat you don't want to be in unless you relog.  A Revenant with Shiro equipped can activate super-speed and outrun enemies and eventually get out of combat they don't want to be in, and Thief has tools if you build for them but that class does better *not* getting aggro than it does *losing* it.
---
Oh, and a final gripe - if I had 1g for each time I've been in a completely cleared area of a zone, opened the map, and am attacked *while clicking on my desired waypoint*, I'd be able to buy a Legendary off of the TP.  And I'd be most of the way to a second.
---
The beauty and joy of the game is weighed down by this garbage and the frustration of it eventually wears me down to the point where I'll play something else for a few weeks or months before coming back for new content.  No other game I've played *slows you down to a sluggish nightmare-like speed* to *keep you in combat,* and that alone is the feature I enjoy of all other games.  On PoF maps in particular if you get forced into combat while traveling it's often faster to get killed and waypoint than it is to disengage.  While it happens elsewhere to a similar degree, PoF enemies are thick enough, and condi-spewing enough, that the fact you wind up aggroing a chain of half a dozen of them in the course of trying to get out of combat is just *exhausting.*
---
Oh. I didn't know about the potion. That's good to know, but makes everything more complicated since I haven't considered AR in my build templates. Time to do it all from the beginning!
---
If I'm playing my Soulbeast the answer is usually to merge, as the pet is six zip codes away chewing on some random slab of hit points.  With every other class if I can't spot the source of aggro I just relog, as it's never worth the hassle to hunt it down.
---
Good to know
---
When a branded griffon goes AFK on me?  I just leave.  Screw it.  They're not worth the wait and they're the only enemy in the game that gives us plenty of time to disengage.
---
He said he didn't plan to raid so you can't expect 2 chronos on the group, thus aiming for 100% should be done anyway I think
---
I'll second this, though my gripe in Underworld is the damned archers.  Same basic annoyance - endlessly pissing you off from range - only they can close on you from their spawn locations.  Ugh.
---
Every time one knocks me off a cliff and/or otherwise stuns me to my death I complain in map chat to a chorus of agreement.  PoF harpies are a thing not even the most ardent anet-can-do-no-wrong fan of the game has apologized for.
---
I want to know what that exposed skin is all about. The entire right side of the outfit is ripped apart, exposing the skin underneath. From the right arm, the right side of the chest, to the right leg all the way down to the boot, you can see some weird corrupted skin or sylvari tree bark skin? Is it dragon corruption, some weird sylvari skin, or a new mist corruption we haven’t seen before? 
---
It makes me wonder if Scarlet Briar is going to hop out of the mists wearing this.
---
A thing that stunk about this event - really, really rankled me - is when it was a high-population event for a few days (due to being required for a collection), something like 3/4 of the people there for it just AFKed on mounts.  They refused to help with the pre events, which meant about half a dozen of us had to carry another twenty or so who reaped the fruits of our labor. slkjhfgjhshgfkjl.
---
The underworld is trying to break through there.  Time to go ectoplasm hunting.  I bet Fire Brands and Druids will do epic DPS down there.
---
HEY BUDDY, IM NOT YOUR GUY

Good luck!

This. Most annoying thing I can think of at the moment. I believe Skyscale was introduced as a fix for this. Hover on your Skyscale to prevent it.

What if they get better?.... ~~Burn~~ Ban them anyway!!!

Then don't answer it and delete instead of bitching. The stupid one is not hte one you think.

What is wrong with you for providing false data instead of deleting the email and moving on ? You didn't have a gun pointed on you to fill it, right ?
---
speedhack and noclip, Ty for sharing i hope a gm will see this video and ban that player.
---
They don't want personal data. Just answer things like this vaguely if you have such deep privacy concerns - but still want to contribute. It's used for analyses not for tracking you and your habits down.

If you don't want to contribute at all then why even bother answering a survey.
---
Have different run speed is always a bad design decision. Oh boy when I thing back to Lineage2 where the different races had different run speed...
---
Totally with you. It is horrible. It's all designed for zerg vs zerg. So boring. My main guild is a WvW guild and they play it every day for hours. I don't get them. The 2 guild raids and the head start. Every week is more than enough for me. Roaming is dead on my server and this change does not help.
---
The worst thing is - sometimes I could interrupt them while they were taking flight, sometimes they are immune as soon as their hindlegs leave the earth, sometimes even while they've already landed for 3 seconds. There's just no way to tell if they are invulnerable or not.
---
The thing is, if you can mount you can also use the wp so there is no point in mounting first.
---
As I was thinking about getting back to GW. Well then, Skyrim it is.
---
You forgot the one asshole who literally spends hours doing nothing but tapping your keep. Get ganked, respawn, go back to tapping the keep every life. Forever.
---
Get a warclaw then?
---
Name it: Lamethieves!
---
Actually, delta said he's going to end support for arc build templates once the official solution is released. So we better hope anet's solution is anywhere near as good as delta's. (it won't be)
---
Didn't know warclaws can dodge through gates ...
---
Maybe just keep them outside?
---
Too much rant, to little work. 
---
As Joko once said: "Put your awakened body to good use, or I am not gonna awaken you next time!"
---
What do u have to hide, cp? Calm down u absolute incel.
---
You are missing the point...
---
Well, your own fault for grinding like a monkey. If you hate it so much, then just play casually, do something else, and the gold will come in passively. You don't need legendaries, and you definitely don't need to rush grind them. Does it matter if it takes 2 months or one year? No. Your sanity is more worth than a stupid item. So congratz on not realising that and getting burned out.
---
Same with minions that just attack ANYTHING and you cannot call them back to you :-(
---
I never would answering any survey.. And nobody should. But that is a concept that you never will understand and I am not here to educate you

Check the hoard and exotic chest. Each one has 1G plus other drops so teq is 2g plus w/e else drops which is a fair amount. Compare that to the 20coins per 28day login cycle. So even over the same period of time doing teq every day for 28 days is 56g last i check coins were 1.6g. So with just the guaranteed 2g from doing teq every day you could buy 35coins with that.
---
I get you are ranting here but lets try and stick to the facts.
---
Sometimes that gatekeeping serves a purpose if you do not know the quality of people that you are pugging with. When attempting QtP CM with pugs I was joining groups that wanted KP of normal mode and some other CM KP from the wing. I pugged for about 9 hours without much success since a normal mode KP doesn't translate into an ability at higher difficulties or being able to sustain a reasonable DPS rotation.
---
When running my own pug, myself and two friends requested 100 Dhuum KP and some experience of Wing 7 (I have 239 Dhuum KP after donating 50 or so to guilds). That group got the CM in an hour and a half as they had greater experience on more mechanically heavy and punishing fights and have the KP to show they probably know their roles and they did aside from a Fractal God Scourge that was hard carried after dying at 60%.
---
For my friend group, that includes both experienced raiders and roleplayers that have never killed Dhuum on normal and have only done a few other CMs, we did QtP CM in about 40 minutes (full W7 CM clear in 1 hour 45 mins) because we know how each other play and people listen and adapt. That isn't the norm in pugs. 
---
When faced with something difficult where I want a kill, I'll definitely ask for a high amount of experience. On the flip side, the casual / training groups I run require no KP if we use LFG. Gatekeeping serves a purpose and I can fully agree with it on challenging and immediately new content when pugging since being lumped with people who haven't got sufficient experience can lead to burnout and disengaging from raids.
---
As for getting more people into raiding and retaining them? That is why we should have an easy mode and repeatable CMs, perhaps limited to the Call of the Mists wing each week?
---
Brown bear ranger pet on backup...always

My wife liked to do PvP. She didn't run any sort of coherent build, never typed in chat and mostly enjoyed doing objectives.   
---
The non stop hate and whining about unfair op builds or "mechanic abuse" (because capturing points is cheating? Uh?) got so bonkers that she stopped playing.
---
GW2 PVP is a hyper toxic shit show on par with the worst of them.
---
You can play something really tanky like necro, but really, HoT is more about learning the enemy patterns than it is about raw tankiness - lots of things can and will oneshot even the tankiest builds, so it's better to learn what attacks to avoid, and how to avoid them.

Can't believe this is a real request.

Thanks! It's Photoshop :D

thats funny considering even less players play fractal challenge motes than raids and what the hell is an open world challenge- simply doesnt exist

That's a good shout, I will think of that in future drawings, thanks!

Enemies that charge at you and their hitbox is 3 times wider than their model
---
Was gonna say that..... What a pain.

Hmm.. we didn‘t have humans in a month. Maybe it should be their turn instead?
---
Alright so answer that - it has nothing to do with personal data then if you feel you shouldn't be answering surveys. I'll leave my educating towards you at this point as you seem reluctant to reciprocate.
---
No way.
---
We already have a lots of way to pvp.
---
Dude, you can forget it. These bast**** (they don’t deserve to be called „Hacker“) never get banned.
---
Do you remember the SAB „Hacker“ who were selling Trib Mode? He made over 500G every hour and streamed it on Twitch!
---
I think he got banned 1 year later after 1000‘s of reports if I remember correctly.

Yeah Ive been practicing with support tempest and condi mirage but my main is still definitely thief XD.
---
They know anet takes their time banning hackers.
---
I dont really like it, they should have left it as it is, atm the warclaw is completely fine.
---
THIS. In most cases I log out and log back in, because it's faster than waiting/running to get out of combat.

Different player races sit differently in different chairs.

For example: in the Dragon Emblazoned Throne, asura might sit in the centre, where humans might sit at the side and lean on the arm. (not in position to look ingame, so cant check specific poses)

OMG!! I FORGOT!! /facepalm. Thank you!!! And you're right, I remember exiting from wvw back to the place I was before!!

I think I found the write up in your history, and I'm definitely trying it out! I'm going to use my viper set so I won't use Adventurer's Runes and Celestial Weapons, but at least I can use leftover ls currencies and unopened triumphant exotic armor boxes to get some Celestial gear. Gameplay-wise it seems fun, if it works I could try to optimize for it once I'm done with the Fractals build.
---
Legendary use a fair amount of them
---
it's [YoloMouse](https://pandateemo.github.io/YoloMouse/). I use it too because the cursor's so hard to find at times
---
no no no, if he saw 1 group asking that means EVERYONE is asking.
---
You might be confusing some scourge mechanics. Scourge is not always in shroud. Your F5 Skill Desert Shroud counts as entering shroud for trait-mechanics. So everytime you use you F5, you get a small buff symbol from plague sending. Its used up after the next attack from you, while there are conditions on you and transfers up to 2 conditions. Your obeservation thst only one condition disappears might come from the interaction with another scourge trait. In Scourge-Traitine, you can choose abrasive grit in the first tier. It removes one condition from allies and yourself after getting barrier. You get barrier from your F1,F3 and F5. So This effect will come into play before plague sending, so if you press any barrier skill, the first thing that happens will be one condition disappearing. Hope that helps.
---
No, it's not just you. This game is full of players who only spam 1 to kill stuff and use 5 signets without activating them, so it's expected for them to struggle when they don't know how to make a half decent build.
---
Just because majority of content can be cleared that way doesn't mean that absolutely everything should be, especially in expansion maps.
---
Well the issue is because I have "Emulate a virtual desktop" and "Automatically capture the mouse in full-screen windows" enabled in the wine settings.
---
I need these both on because without either, the mouse does not function correctly when rotating the camera - it'll move the camera but as soon as the cursor position reaches the edge of the gw2 window, it becomes extremely violent and erratic as it cannot wrap the cursor position or whatever gw2 does to allow you to continuously rotate the camera in one direction.
---
Which DE is your friend using? Could be worth testing.
---
They was at E3 with HOT
---
Yes Hot the expansion was announced at PAX South. Guild Halls and the pre purchase were announced on the PC Gaming Show at E3 2015.
---
Just look at the main page...pve plebs complaining about open world lol.
---
To get back on the topic, the main comment is wrong because you'll get dismounted as soon as you get in that choke, with or without evades and that's why literally no one ever does it.
---
just that the jade sea will no longer be filled with jade \~cough cough\~
---
but yes we all want Cantha! 
---
(at least i think everyone that also played GW1 will want that \^\^)
---
Those evades don't give 100% evade frames no matter how hard you press your buttons. Literally no one pushes through chokes with mounts because it's suicide.
---
It's even worse than dodging in on foot because when you get dismounted you don't have access to your skills for about half second, which is enough to get downed in a choke point.
---
Pre- purchaseBuying hot is expansion :)
---
It's still there in personal story instances. Was pretty confusing when I started playing gw2 since instances had nothing to do with actual city. Found out years later than LA got destroyed.
---
Pretty sure that receiving a survey isn't confidential information, nor would OP be under any obligation to not share any such confidential information unless they had already signed some sort of NDA, which they don't seem to have as of this posting.
---
The expansion was announced and revealed at PAX South. Guild Halls and Pre Purchase was revealed at E3. How hard is this to understand. Heart of Thorns was not revealed at E3 2015.
---
Minionmancer GW2. Google it. Have fun roflstomping everything.
---
What happened to suck at love if u may ask?
---
I suspect he is using Master of Corruptions, which makes Blood is Power as he has mentioned apply Torment on himself.
---
Condition Cleanse/Converts iirc will affect the newest applied condition , which means if he uses F5 or F2 after casting Blood is Power, Torment is prioritized first to be removed.
---
Without getting into that shit-flinging contest of a thread, I just wanted to let you know that legendaries earn themselves if you just do a tiny amount of work every day. Clovers, coins and whatnot add up via log-in rewards, doing a few daily gathering clusters will get you the needed materials, earning a few gold per day in addition to your 2g from dailies will allow you to buy what'S left.
---
As a rule of thumb it's around a year per legendary if you take it really slow and relaxed. No need to burn yourself out.
---
I’m very much doubtful that new players who only encounter old LA for 20 mins during the personal story can develop nostalgia for it....
---
For me it's not nostalgia, I just don't like the new LA.
---
those charr and norn up in the east and north sure have some weird architecture
---
i couldn't care less about the ash legion homelands. let's go somewhere else, like cantha
---
Also happening right now with the world bosses. The pre's were failing for the Megadestroyer and I thought I enter a new map that was empty. Turns out at the WB waypoint there were soooo maaanyyy freaaaking people AFK-ing. O.o
---
I managed to save the pre and after that \*new\* people poared in and we did the WB.
---
Maybe they will try to find out how they Hack or if there are more of them using the Same hack to ban them alltogether.
---
but maybe they just dont regard it as that Important
---
press f5 before you finish casting blood is power. that way both skills sync up and also the condis are directly send over before any other trait / skill can kick in to remove them from you.
---
Actually just doing the pact network agents every day is pretty easy. Wait for the day when you can use those profitably, about once every six weeks or so. Easy money/mats.
---
I use it to buy the karma gathering tools, might be dumb, idk, but I'm leveling crafting on 8 different characters and it's the easiest way to get lower level cloth and crafting materials like claws and stuff like that.
---
Right now, looking at those screen shots, I'm really hyped for a return to Cantha, and on balance Factions is probably my favourite GW1 campaign .... but ask me in a day or so and I'll likely find the prospect of an entirely new region more enticing. Ideally I want the game to thrive long enough to give us both. 
---
IF Cantha is next though, I'd be more than happy with that. An underwater jade city, a dense, massive, rejuvenated Echovald Forest, a two-tiered Kaineng, the undercity of old still thriving deep beneath a shining new metropolis .... sign me up.
---
As an elementalist who has the air specialization skilled:
---
Switching to air to buff myself with swiftness: The minor trait [Electric Discharge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Electric_Discharge) hits some yellow NPC nearby... thanks, now I'm in combat until I lost that newly attacked NPC, which I NEVER INTENDED to hit...
---
Honestly, just for this minor trait I would very much appreciate to being able to disable a minor trait...
---
Don't feel bad, my friend who got me into the game that's been playing for 5+ years didn't know you could keybind them until I told her. Other surprises were you can right click on your daily login and it goes through all the clicking in one click, and you can dodge roll while doing the guild mission races where you get transformed into an animal.
---
no
---
Except, no.
---
As long as it doesn't show them also getting better no. ;)
---
You do realise the whole point of a survey is to gather data? If you’re gonna throw a hissy fit, then don’t do the survey.
---
Has someone tried combo of peerless infusion+ polyluminescent undulating? Does it change color of peerless aura? PM pic If anyone got.
---
You’re dumb.
---
what a nightmare. that's a buttload of wasted space... is that freaking seaweed salad? yikes.
---
I want to get into raiding but my guild is pretty casual. 
---
What builds are in high demand so that I can find a spot easily?
---
Me "800 gems is far too much for a character slot!"
---
Anet "What if it was 600?"
---
Me "I'll take 5!"
---
I am simple : anything related to Cantha, I upvote.
---
^and ^I ^cry
---
still the best  food in the game if you manage to keep un 80%~ uptime, perfect for underwater farm or pug raids
---
He literally deleted all his comments.
---
Check snowcrows website for more info about bosses, builds, compositions as well as training guilds.
---
Having an issue resolved by a GM and my friend's issue (same kind) being denied.
---
Being the same issue, I'd assume the same rules would follow.
---
As it's told and repeated for years, there are training groups and guilds for raids, and yes you're not expected to hop into LFG as a fresh beginner.
---
You don't "need" ascended to play WvW. As for other parts of the game, it helps slightly, but learning your class, your placement and your encounters will provide way more ways to survive and contribute than a mere stats upgrade.
---
Unwelcoming ? Some might be. Especially towards people that don't want to put a single drop of their own sweat into training effort and research.
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game. I teach a lot of new players where to go and what to do. Vayne.8563 .
---
Your problem is, you are expecting others to carry you on their level of experience, while you refuse to do the learning yourself. For PvP and WvW you can watch skillful streamers. For raids, you can join training groups who just like you are learning the content.
---
The problem is you, not the game.
---
&gt; I have been level 80 for a year 
---
&gt; Raids
---
How much time of that year have you spent in gearing up properly and learning one or two dps rotations at the golem in the special forces training area?
---
Norn fighting with flame legion on charr homelands :O
---
&gt; whats the point of opening  it right away, if you don't get anything you need from it?
---
Then why not destroy it?
---
You will get something out of them that you need, maybe not in the next half hour but at some point like materials and gold.
---
I‘ll never get it why ppl hide their bags.  Just speaking for myself, can organize things way better then with one big space.
---
I save all those worthless lootboxes as well for some reason.  I might use the good ol salvage-o-matic to free up space on my non-played alt.  What size bags are those?
---
SO basically this is a problem of ¨I am unwilling to take the time to learn anything and expect everyone else to just do it for me¨
---
Yeah, but that's just what I'm talking about. This way to convert karma doesn't scale at all. 30k karma a day just about keeps my total karma level. The method's not fit to get rid of multiple millions.
---
Don't quote me on this but it probably got the name when it turned solid. Jade quarries probably came after this, as did the material.
---
 I'm pretty sure this is a troll post. Its a good one though.
---
You probably don't have many bag slots..
---
I've made two legendaries tho. Guess I just farm too much.
---
Each pact network supply is 5250 and you can get 6 a day. Getting all of them should keep your supply at least reasonably managable. I don't get htat much every day so over time, when I do it my karma ends up going down. 
---
I also buy minis and everlasting tonics in the new zones because I can.   The point is some days I earn more karma, some less. It's a resource. You don't have to spend it all. 
---
Eventually you're getting return on it.   I mean when I'm making legendaries I obviously use more too.
---
How dare you not agree with the mass mob of idiots on reddit! Downvoted!!
---
Same happened to me. Nice surprise to see all those goodies. (from 2014 and just started playing the other week)
---
What makes it worse is that they have shown to be able to create better mobs like the wyverns that only take off if you don't break them.
---
If we get Cantha, I am certainly getting back to the game. I can't get excited anymore about the current living world, haven't checked anything out of the season 4. 
---
But if they give us Cantha... I sure won't be dropping the game for a while. It's all I ever wanted from the start, to return to that world, it was perfect.
---
My 20 cents - don't. If you do then a good option would be that you unlock 1-2 mounts, then start another char and enjoy the game with mounts.
---
You can see almost all deleted comments by changing the link, from reddit.com/r/... to re**move**ddit.com/r/...

Welcome back :-)
---
I started 9 months ago and found WvW very easy and fun to get into even with exotics. I'm not saying my experience is correct but my interpretation is the emphasis is less on gear rarity, as your post implies, and more on finding a style that works for you and optimizing your build. Heck I'm still using all berserker gear which is not optimal but I can still kill other players and capture objective while roaming. And if you still can't do that there is always the option to zerg.   
---
Idk about pvp but with raids you can just join a community that does training for raids. There are entire guilds built around it and thrive by having training sessions for noobs.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but your inventory is full of useless garbage that you should have sold, opened or salvaged ages ago.
---
You should also stop wasting relics on consumable fractal potions. Just trade them all for relics, and use the relics to get the everlasting one.
---
I just sent an anonymous ticket containing the billing address, card holder name (Sent both mine and my mothers, since I don't remember which card I used) and possible char names I used. Received an answer later along with an password recovery e-mail. Try to include any information you possibly can.
---
Obsidian Sanctum has all services pretty neatly together in one place, and you won't waste skirmish map slots.
---
Yyyyyeeeaahhhh. If only we could count on that happening.
---
Agreed. Cantha would be boring.
---
I mean, I get they could play on the nostalgia, but it'd be so boring. Bring some new places, not visiting old ones...again.
---
I’d like to see more mountainous regions with Norn and Kodan
---
Yeah. That seems to be the sweetspot.
---
Make the arrow at the bottom of the trebuchet aim at the ship, then charge the trebuchet at 100%, 90% and 80%, and one of those 3 is bound to hit.
---
sounds like someones entitled, 2k hours aint shit, you get mystic coins by purely staying interested in the game aka just fucking logging in, its not a race. stop crying
---
I prefer events to collections and quests every time, but most of them are worthless rewards wise. Here take 100 Karma and 5silver for your efforts!
---
Its one of the reasons no one wants to do pre events leading up to bosses or metas. They are simply not worth the time.
---
The ship is outside the instance limits. You can't go there.
---
In both WvW and PvP gamemodes the comparison with other MMOs makes Gw2 win by a mile because a veteran player doesn't have years of advantadge over a newbie in the gear department. On gear for pvp everybody has everything available the same so it's up to you to choose the most suitable one. It's a matter or skill. On WvW, well yeah, you have to get your own gear, but let me tell you that the difference between exotic and ascended is minimal.
---
As for endgame PVE content, while i agree that those LI requirements are insane you will find the same problem in every MMO. Many "experienced" players only want to play with other experienced players (oh, and we can all agree that having 100+ LIs proves nothing) so they with try to filter group compositions. It's the typical vicious circle: "I'm a newbie player and need experience to be able to play with experienced players, but if i don't play with experienced players i can't get experience.". You can break this vicious circle in many ways, either forming your own groups with other inexperienced players or joining appropiate guilds. Community guilds are ussually good because they have training sessions were one or a few experienced players will spend their time to explain things and make your learning curve easier.
---
Oh, and i rarely ask things on mapchat, i prefer to do it on any of my guilds but from time to time i receive random messages from people (usually about the skins of the gear i use) and i always answer politely. Now that i think, very rarely i receive "hate" whispers. The last time i rememeber is when i unlocked the Aurora skin on release day (it was the first legendary trincket released). Toxic comments can happen, they are more common on pvp matches and the best way to handle them is to just ignore them and if the situation requires it report it.
---
Precisely the main thing that makes the difference between Gw2 and other games like WoW is that you "don't need 4 years of grinding" to be at the same level as other veteran players. That is exactly the opposite of what you are saying at the end of your post. You just need to be skilled at what you do
---
Poor people have 60 or less. 100 is an upper middle class thing.
---
Jup, 100% right. So quote as much as you want.
---
you know, there's something called bank that lets you store things you don't need to carry with you at all times. There are special NPCs on every city with one NPC with a gold bag icon that lets you access it. :D
---
the 2 types of charr. edgelord and pastel princess
---
I don't understand how anyone can play without showing the individual bags. (That's not a knock at the OP here; I was jut noticing in other replies and generally in many other posts that many people like to combine their bags like this). Everytime your inventory changes these sorts of combined bag setups wind up looking like a giant mess and confusing.
---
I completely agree. Elona already feels like it is a fan service for gw1 non stop. I want something new. Let us further explore the far shiverpeaks. Go to the charr homelands. Or underground to the old asuran cities, the stone dwarves and dredge. If they revamp under water combat I would love to go to the deep sea and explore an under water world.
---
The gw2 community is so carebear they'll consider anything toxic and vile to maintain their delusions of grandeur.
---
And elite kurzic armor!
---
13% upvote, this need to go lower
---
As someone who played gw1 AFTER playing gw2, I would hate to see us going to cantha, probably one of my least favorite places so far.
---
Yep, I played it a couple days ago. Still a very fun game.
---
The same way you clear every other phase really. Save high dps skills for breakbar, break it, burst him down. You even have a healer which makes the run a lot easier, the rest is just paying attention to surroundings.
---
Dont forget to jump and use special action key to avoid crucial attacks or floor. SAK is even strong CC, but you shouldnt lack that with your comp.
---
Well I think he's pretty funny.
---
I guess it doesn’t bother me. Much of what you said to me feels like nitpicking things, or just things that are fine design that you personally just find annoying. Some of what you reference is designed so that you aren’t just running through the game world completely ignoring entire aspects of it.
---
The one thing I will agree with though is the unkillable mob point. If they’re going to block everything for a solid five seconds then there should be some kind of additional mechanic to it probably. It’s not a huge deal, but it would enrich the game.
---
[Here's a Canthan expansion idea from last year.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Cantha)
---
There is no way Canthans can compare to asura technology, those guys invented just about everything
---
Cantha is my least favourite campaign in GW1. 
---
While I wouldn't mind going there someday, I hope we won't see it or any other human centered content anytime "soon".
---
I want to see Kaineng burn. I need revenge after so many years.
---
What *I* want is this is to go east and west of Tyria, not south.
---
So no, we don't all want that.
---
And people also want new lands, because we *didn't* go there in GW1.
---
Just another reason I'm not playing GW2, amongst the sPvP/WvW content being so stale now and being in maintenance mode compared to PvE.
---
One utility skill is barely affecting your synergy. You can even change a single trait or weapon for that purpose.
---
Everything in open world is situational, including fighting, especially with mounts. Even when you actually need to get in combat, you dont need a specifically tailored 15 skill sequence and in case you do, you'd adapt your build to that, just like you adapted your exploration build to mobs that spam random stuff on you.
---
I think you are rather the one missing the painfully obvious point.
---
Furry?
---
It's been a few hundred years, I'm sure it looks much better, now.
---
I love being stuck in combat because one of my shouts hit a fly or something.
---
it really isn't. i played dota for years, i even used to queue in the wee hours of the morning most days and sure, i met a lot of cunts, but the overwhelming majority just did not speak at all, aside from the mutes the next biggest group were pinoys who shouldn't have been on australian servers anyway, they were mouthy (and stupid) but their stupidity sort of made their insults more funny than annoying. i don't know where dota got such a reputation from but i've played csgo, dota 2, chivalry and rust and on a toxicity level, dota comes last in that list, by far.
---
Most single player games have natural and mandatory skill progression though, do you think those are hardcore? Or is it something justified by them having an easy mode?
---
I don't want cantha. I want fire legion lands
---
Yes it is
---
you must be new here
---
The fractal potions are desorganized y.y
---
it's cancer, terminal i'm afraid.

I'm pretty sure that nothing has actually confirmed the Jade Sea reverted back to being water? It was rumors, nothing more. And we saw the Zephyrites arrive to one of the Festivals of the Four Winds with brand new Jade carved statues/chunks.

First, it can be tricky to get in the right spot.  Second, when I did it it would often not show the cast bar.  It takes about 10 seconds for it to complete. I realized if I just stay there it would complete, and I could see the achievement recorded.  How that works for you, it is buggy.
---
I don't disagree with something being there to grind for. But that being the Mystic Coin is like telling your progression to go fuck itself off the edge.
---
I'm aware that you can do Fractal CMs for a chance to get coins but everything else on that material list can be gained rather easily without grinding like a madamn. There just needs to be a other sources of mystic coins.
---
I haven't played GW1 but I love Asian aesthetics. Also, an ocean of green crystal sounds hella cool.
---
 If content isnt allowed to be challenging, doesn't it become annoying over time by default?
---
The mobs fight you, that's normal. But they're not allowed to be scary enough to kill players. So people are annoyed by being kept in combat by monsters that arent threatening.
---
And any "solutions" proposed only make mobs less scary, combat more annoying rather than influential and thus worsens the issue.
---
Make mobs challenging or delete mob aggro from the game entirely.
---
That's only true for automated ban waves. If they're obviously cheating and get reported with proof, there is no reason not to take action then. It just takes more effort, so Anet doesnt.
---
I am not sure the effectiveness of their algorithm to find hackers/bots. I have a friend who has been botting for the better part of 4 years and they still haven't even sent a GM to say hi to him. He is an RL friend so I feel like I can't report him though I have voiced my disgust to his actions on a daily basis. 
---
The suite for his bot he uses also has a speed hack and noclip since he normally checks his bot settings by turning on the speed hack and making sure it is working properly. I am not sure how someone who is on for 24h+ is not immediately flagged, the guy will play his char for ~4-5 hours then just bot in the normal locations until he gets back.
---
GW2 engine is having a seizure caused by too many fancy effects.

I had the same happen. Was nice.
---
In WoW I had my account stolen and used as a farm account for awhile. Got it back from support to find a few thousand gold (when that was a lot of money) and my bags full of stacks of crafting mats. Pretty ok with that.
---
It's*
---
While I do adore Cantha, I just hope we explore some other parts of Tyria instead of just revisiting and rehashing old lore. 
---
We could maybe interact with Cantha in a way? Visit a Canthan colony on some remote land we've never been too (I loved the pre-release parts of Factions with the little Luxon and Kurzick settlements in Kryta).
---
Thought these was one of those stories where your account got stolen and you would recover it and find a couple legendaries sitting there. Would have been great!
---
Good on you, though!! Cheers and welcome back
---
Anet just doesnt care enough. They dont want to invest much money into security, which is also why the banwaves they do have are typically majorly flawed.
---
\*cough cough "Deep Sea Dragon" cough
---
Does anyone else hear a cat "meow" whenever you hit the last 15% phase of Ensolyss in 99CM?
---
did i just get "O" hand-ed?
---
It's common practice in most games to ban in waves.  The thinking behind it is to try and avoid giving away any kind of information on how the hacks are detected. Take this scenario for example: a company has an automated process that immediately bans anyone detected using a hack.  A hack developer can then use this to guide his development, making small tweaks, gradually escalating until he gets banned, then rolling back his most recent change, knowing that was what triggered the ban, and trying a different approach. If you ban in scheduled waves, then it deprives hack makers of this information, as they now don't know which change triggered detection. 
---
That said, for public cases like this, especially when it's so blatantly obvious, they should make an exception and ban immediately, as the negatives of letting the hacker remain outweigh the benefits of masking detection, when hacks are this obvious and come to the attention of the wider playerbase.
---
Oh yeah, Cronenberg Cantha is going to be a blast.
---
I've always felt that for a game that's about eXpLoRaTiOn that this game has way too many trash mobs. How the fuck am I supposed to enjoy the scenery when an Arid Devourer is flinging god knows what at me from a light year away?
---
No one's a professional "playtester", just tester.
---
Play testers are players selected not because of their analytical skills, but more like you construct a poll's target audience: several people with different backgrounds to be able to isolate what your game does well and what it doesn't.
---
(Dev) Testers are people who are selected because they are able to analyse what happens and provide reliable reproduction steps to the rest of the dev team.
---
i only use bags in multiples of ten, and keep my inventory 10-wide. my 32 bag slot occurs just before the screen cutoff. so i pretty much know where every bag begins and ends.
---
Where does [my charr](http://puu.sh/DIT4W/df5fdb3b3e.jpg) fit in?
---
Happy cake day! :D
---
Not sure mate, I see more pretty kitties than edge cats, or at least around the same amount.
---
I've got 23 Charr, so I usually keep an eye on other mad cats for design ideas.
---
Swap to a high DPS comp instead.   
---
Firebrand and Renegade instead of Chrono and Druid, Banner warrior instead of Reaper and Power Soulbeast instead of Daredevil. You'll be significantly faster and more efficient. 
---
It takes our team around 30 - 40 minutes (depending on instabilities and fractals) to do both CM's and all T4's. We run this comp and it's working well.
---
actually, the email itself isn't confidential really.

---
Style vs sjw
---
&gt; If it doesnt cause negative pr then anet doesnt care.
---
Thing is it actually isn't negative pr. Every game has hackers, especially pvp games. Recording a hacker is not that special and unless somebody is new to online games, nobody will think "omg, what a hacker contanimated game".
---
Ironically your charr looks like most charr PCs I see
---
Yeah my Xera encounters haven't been the best because I was definitely victim to Ley Line Fall Syndrome since it seemed like my client wouldn't recognize the ley once it spawned.  (But this was when Xera was always bugged)  As for Deimos, I think I've gotten twenty pulls but we've always had some sort of kiter issue in the last few phases and the group would just get too frustrated after 5 pulls.  (and that was with a static group where I was a dps fill in)  :'D It's a shame though because I really like the Samarog fight and Cairn isn't too bad, but it's always... disheartening when you've been stuck on Deimos since release since most of your groups that you sub for stop after Sammie and will reattempt Deimos later.
---
But we know it now. ;)
---
While Cantha was my favorite in GW1 and I’ve replayed it endlessly. I agree 100% the crystal desert was cool but let’s keep it fresh.
---
I don't need to know where one bag starts and another ends. I don't see a reason for myself so have the game show those boundaries and prefer to save that screen space instead.
---
You're supposed to kill it and enjoy the scenery for the 7.215 seconds it takes for the next group of pathing mobs to come by.  
---
Then you're supposed to kill them and continue enjoying the scenery for the next 4.6991 seconds remaining before the thing respawns.  
---
Then simply repeat the enjoyment process until you've enjoyed all you can!
---
[Scroll down to Challenge Mote, on the Living World Section.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Challenge_Mote)

I meant challenge motes within the story episodes, that was entirely my mistake. Sorry.
---
I want that 11 seconds of my life back.
---
probably promoting stacks of mordrem or evergreen slivers into lodestones via doubleclick and autoclicker.
---
Each promotion gives a little sparkly animation, which looks like an aura, if chained together (or a trail, if you move while doing it).
---
I used to do that in LA while running around and transformed into a jackalope (which completely disappears under the animations) to puzzle other players.
---
especially as necro
---
Honestly rushing a leggy is never worth it.
---
Specially if you dont have any other goals.
---
When im crafting a leggy i buy 10-15 mystic coins and 10 runestones per day while playing WvW and getting clovers + VM.
---
The burnout from mindlessly farming a meta is inevitable unless you find it fun to do the same thing for hours.
---
Been doing this for over a year, crafted 2 leggy weapons + 4 pieces of gear + aurora and barely touched any of the "farming maps"
---
Eyesore
---
The aggro ring from gw1 was excellent design, why didnt it make it to gw2 is beyond me.
---
Okey sooo, this got me thinking.
---
All the Jade that got mined from the Jade Sea got used for something right?
---
And now the Jade sea in turning back to water. Does that mean the Jade they sold also is turning to liquid?
---
The market is anemic
---
Keep 1 of each unidentified gear in your shared inventory slots, that's all the management you need, everything else should be opened &amp; consumed as it comes in. While using a single hidden bag at the bottom for gear &amp; food.
---
I mean people give you flak but in my eyes not too awful. I like how you just arrange bags without being tempted to open them all. That inventory is definitely "managed" but not in any way cleaned out, which again cleaning out was not the point of this post.
---
So yeah, my only gripes would be just putting the unopened lootception into a guild bank that you own. I don't throw 180g (32 slot) x 10 = roughly 1.8k gold for 300 slots (or close to it), but I do have guild banks with with 2 x 250 slot guild banks which didn't cost me 1.8k gold to get haha. Also my mule carries all acc bound shit. Pmuch to each their own.
---
&gt; For example the time from Januar to April 2019. This excludes W7, but for W1-6 it shows which Wing are played the most in these 3 months. So it would show the actuall popularity of each raid wing.
---
GW2Efficiency can't exactly display that sort of information as the results are based on people that have completed the achievement for killing each boss.
---
Same, but then I  see horrendously ugly mount skins in the rest of PvE.
---
I've given up caring. It's just not worth the brain cells. The same people that were cheating before I got banned for the bull hash were blatantly cheating when I got back. It's only gotten worse because they dont expect Anet to do anything.
---
What a sad thing to brag about... It's not even organized correctly.. Were you raised by a schoolbag?
---
lol thank you, I will
---
Moving the UI has nothing to do with keybinds though. I guess they’re saying they’d prefer to click the skills to use them, but that’s not effective anyway in GW2 especially. This is a different combat style and is too active for clicking to be terribly effective in most cases.
---
It does sound like they just need to accept they’re not playing WoW anymore. You can’t leave a game and try to find the game in every other game you play. If they let themselves enjoy GW2 for what it is then they’ll have a better time.
---
States the person that says "nobody will think what a hacker contaminated game". Always fun to argue with omnipresent mindreaders with double standards.
---
This is if the player has ever killed that boss right?
---
you asked a question on a public forum without naming anyone specific in a comment thread that the OP didn't start :)

---
Nope, I want something new. But maybe because I didn't play the one in Cantha but all others.
---
I don't know. Elona had many reasons to go there and a rich, lore-based history (so does Cantha, actually). I had not yet played GW1 when PoF came out and I absolutely loved it. Later, when I started playing GW1 I came to know all the famous locations, persons etc. and enjoyed seeing them in GW2 even more. Also, most of the places you've named have already been (at least partly) explored in GW1, namely: Far Shiverpeaks, Charr Homelands, Depths of Tyria (with Asuran structures, major Dwarv-related plots, minor Dredge-related stories). Only the deep see is something we've never seen before, but that one favors Cantha even more as it lies far outside in the Unending Ocean. Isles of Janthir, Woodland Cascades would be new, too, but unlike Cantha there is no immediate connection to the current story.
---
As others pointed out the game is quite fun while you level, so pulling is unnecessary. From my personal experience though - I wanted to unlock season 3 map, my char was level 76-78 and I used teleport to friend to get to the bloodstone ruby zone. Gathering unbound magic seemed to give me quite a lot of xp and I managed to get those last few levels in no time.
---

Personally I leave my 1-5 on 1-5. Then I use Shift+q, shift+r, and shift+e for utilities, X for heal, and shift+z for Elite skill.this makes all skills easily accessible to me and honestly isn’t too complicated. I did put F5 on my mouse though since I was having trouble hitting it as a Druid/Soulbeast.

I've done it hundreds of times. All the other rifts work. Literally it's the last thing I have to do to get the Skyscale and it's bugged... for real.
---
I did. Doesn't work.
---
Instead of wasting dev time and resources on trying to make the WvW mount less of a cancer that's killing the gamemode, they should've fired whoever decided to add mounts to WvW and then removed this shit before he was even out of the building.
---
And people who want that are wrong, and are the people who will drive this already dying game further into the ground
---
For the past 2 months, it's been around 1s 90c to 2s each.  Just at the start of June it started to drop.  Around June 11th is where it hit its lowest in months for 1s 40c.  This was during the meta rush event where bonus boxes were awarding materials, and Iron was one of those.  I'm assuming the prices of materials are slowly recovering after that event.
---
umm, excuse me I've played since launch and I don't have enough money for my 1st legendary tyvm
---
Yes because GW's strory works best when it is human centric, jamming all these races in and trying to spread the stories was one of the worst mistakes Anet has ever made
---
Wouldn't it be wild if it was still half jade?  so you've got pools of water in the midst of eroding/melting jade waves?
---
When was the last time you looked at the price? It's been at the 1.5s+ point for years by looking at gw2spidy. I think it started the increase around when ascended weapons were introduced since deldrimor steel ingots require iron and steel ingots.
---
I like it. It isn't top tier model, but the effect goes well with my [Scarlet's Rainbow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/8/85/Scarlet%27s_Rainbow.jpg) which isn't a top tier gun model either but at least both models are way better than the crappy model used in [Reaver of the Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/c/cf/Reaver_of_the_Mists.jpg)
---
I've been using it for a week, the difference is small but noticeable. My benchmarking isn't exactly a science, but I went from avg 27fps to avg 35fps in LA. 
---
I'm on W7 so I can't use dx12py.
---
Yeah its not like GUILD WARS 2 is the sequel to GUILD WARS or anything? Why would we base it off of the original game. That's crazy talk
---
Speaking of which, I hope the next Star Wars movie takes place underwater, or in the middle ages. I'm sick of all the space, We've seen it already for the past 30 years I mean come on
---
That actually would be pretty neat if they moved Cantha to industrial revolution level or later
---
looks like September 2013: [https://www.gw2tp.com/item/19683-iron-ingot?full=1](https://www.gw2tp.com/item/19683-iron-ingot?full=1)
---
No more bags of gear from raids to open them with lvl 50 characters = a lot less iron supply.
---
I hope someone can make a quick comparison soon, would like to know as well.
---
I mean we don't even know how long they have been gone.  I thought they were just wondering why prices were cheaper around meta rush..
---
All I've ever wanted out of this game. 
---
That and new dungeons.
---
Sadly both of which will probably never happen
---
Silverwastes?????
---
It's fan service if it's irrelevant to the story and brought in for the purpose of only serving fans.
---
However, including the same regions within the same world in a sequel to a game and keeping the story consistent and taking place within the same regions makes perfect sense and isn't fan service.
---
What UI do you think needs changing in order for your friend to have more fun? I don't understand how UI is related to being shit at pressing his keybinds.

Ah, this seems to be the answer. Thank you!

First one is the [Super Sayajin](https://banner2.kisspng.com/20180531/luv/kisspng-goku-vegeta-super-saiyan-dragon-ball-goku-chibi-5b1046bba9fb19.0154594615277933396963.jpg) one for Charrs.
---
sword and staff are on top because i swap them myself, others only with arc templates, hammer should be up as well, but have not done cm dungeon lately.
---
Maybe not.
---
Current Elona looks like a fainting paint of what it was 250 years ago.
---
I don't want the same to happen with Cantha.
---
On top of that there's a lot of touchy issues with the Asian market sensibilities..
---
&gt;Forcing players to take a condi removal doesn't increase the depth of the game. 
---
You're not forced to take a condi removal, you're encouraged to. And diversifying your build to not be min-maxed in open world, imo, does increase the depth of the game.
---
&gt; Having very rare and random spawns for required achievements is not interesting. 
---
TBH this feels more like oversight on ArenaNet's part than anything, caused by poor design from core release where they were guessing on a *lot* of things and had no clue back then that these events would be required for anything beyond drops that could go on the TP.
---
&gt; Having to build specifically around ONE type of enemy doesn't deepen the game. 
---
Who the fuck does this? In fact, the design of the game currently encourages - for open world - designing a build around **multiple** types of enemies.
---
When I do open world, I do not constantly change my build based on what part of the game I'm going. I set up my gear to not be min-maxed, but instead a condi-power hybrid with a bit of defense. Via skills and traits, I'd have one stun break and one condi cleanse, and deal decent to good damage in direct damage and condition damage. And I never have an issue.
---
Designing a build around one type of enemy is foolhardy and stupid and not the game's fault but your own.
---
Based on your post, it feels like you equate "deepening the game" with "making everything roflstomping simple". I wouldn't be surprised if you're one of the people who complained about the Eater of Souls in PoF being impossible to kill.
---
&gt; And that is inconsistency - going from "I will do a desk job" to "hey I'm in the field" without explanation would fall under as inconsistency.
---
For me that's just a change of his mind. Nothing he really needs to explain. He agreed with the desk-condition, but later changed his mind and started fighting again. 
---
Keep in mind that we are "just" the commander. Sure, we are part of the pact and command people, but we don't know everything. If there was an agreement or whatever between Logan, Almorra and the rest, we couldn't known, because we weren't part of it. 
---
Also I don't see Logan as a person who needs to talk with us about the latest news. We didn't heared from him after Head of the Snake, but we didn't see him in any fights, that's why it's likely that he just did his desk job. Because that's the last thing he said. 
---
Unlike watching a movie, in a game we play a character and this character are not supposed to know everything. Ofcourse people doing things independently from us and don't have to inform us about all their steps.
---
At least that's how I see it. :)
---
I never said raids were the only iron source. I made 40g every week from those loot bags.

Belongs in the trash.

Someone had to fill the role of stubborn contrarian for them, don't worry, I think you'll be worthy successor.

Yeah this comment doesn't address your point, but I wasted too many hours of my life arguing with those two buffoons, so I've learned my lesson and won't even engage any further

Don't know, never did that.

It is a legendary Item, You basically don't every need another one for that slot for any of your characters.

Though, You can always mix it up in what you want to do. You don't need to do those "boring" things of the heart but can also catch organs or whatever it is available, IIRC there are also attacks happening which count towards the heart.

It's not actually that bad. you can get them for amalgamated gemstones and trade contracts/elegy mosaics at no limit per day. not sure what your timegate is, but I bought 100 for Vision all at once.

The irony of this statement, given your spam of "game ded" and "anyone who says no cantha is stupid" posts in this thread, is fucking hilariously facepalm worthy.

To you apparently. It's too bad your like/dislike of the story isn't the end all be all you make it out to be.

"you can just dodge x" has been the justification for overtuned or fundamentally flawed skills and builds since the games launch. please try to come up with anything else to say other than that, especially once it goes live.

Given that I don't recall ever interacting with him, no. But I do tend to forget about idiots to save myself from headaches, and given his comments in this thread I saw after my prior post, I'm unsurprised.
---
I dunno, a solid ocean sounds more unique than regular water, since there’s the unending ocean for that. And since it’s a little unclear how fast it’s reverting, they can leave it mostly solid. There’s a lot you can do with that though, creatures breaking free, the surface cracking and underneath it’s water and you get trapped... interesting gameplay stuff

As long as they remove the ability for every single monster to explode on your face on death I'm fine with it.

What chest armor are you using?

It shows most of the bare chest, but I don't think you have this option on medium armor

Oof there have been tons of calculations on the SC discord, back at the end of 2k18 when pchrono got DT as a reworked Trait.

I did read your entire comment. What context am I missing? 
---
The part where YOU state EVERY pvp game has hackers and NOBODY but complete noobs at gaming are scared off by them?
---
Or the part where you call me a mindreader for writing off the stuff you propheticly claim to be true for everyone as something you believe in, not something everyone believes.
---
Please do clarify this context I'm not reading.
---
It won't? It won't mention anything about the Charr-Human relations since their wars? It won't mention the Titans and how the other three Charr factions abandoned them, but the Flame Legion held firm to their belief in them? It won't mention Abaddon, the traitorous human god that was even responsible for the Titans in the first place?
---
It won't mention any of that, you promise? Then what would the story be about?
---
Colorado
---
To each his own but looking at it made me anxious. I open all my bags and chests at the end of each session and mats/gear/weapons not needed sold. Sorry, but I like empty bank and bag slots, and gold in the wallet.
---
&gt;not sure what your timegate is
---
Essentially the timegating is for a discount.  The unlimited ones are purchased with 3 Elegy Mosaics, or 100 Trade Contracts per, while the timegated ones from heart vendors are only 5 Trade Contracts per, but you can only purchase 1 per day per vendor.  So you basically have a choice to spend time, or money/resources. 
---
Worth noting also that this is also a relatively new development; used to be you were limited to only 14 per day (iirc, it was 8 from heart vendors, 1 from the Steward with mosaics, and five from converting Crystalline Ingots), but they changed it when they updated the rewards and timings for the PoF metas, so that the ones purchased from the Steward were unlimited.  This is why it's important for people to always check the wiki, and not rely solely on 3rd party guides, since the guides might be outdated.
---
Man I really need to get back into the game but at this point it's been so long I dont even know where to start
---
As Asura main and sometimes Sylvari, I discover that other races have better Home Instances. x)
---
I agree here. I never played GW1 and only started playing GW2 a little over a year ago.
---
Although witnesses said I had been drinking at the time, the only line of dialogue I remember from the final cutscene of LWS3 is "I guess I'm headed to the Crystal Desert!!!" and I was left thinking it felt forced.
---
I have really enjoyed PoF though.
---
What are you even talking about? It has been the lowest since fall 2015.
---
HAHAHAHA wow...what a read
---
CoF p2 when :)
---
After ac p3 :]
---
The Scarlett series was great....dunno what you're smoking.  I had the most fun with that LS than almost any others.  The map changes, the bosses, the world actually feeling alive and not like its stuck in some weird permaloop of this map takes place before the end of the LS but takes place after another part of the map you can literally walk to.  I shouldn't be in the past in Blazeridge Steppes but in the future in Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Do you mean to tell me those three Superior Sigils of Karka Slaying on the trading post are going to get even more expensive?
---
I guess people didn't realize they can go to another rift in the area and just do that one instead. I headed south after picking up my skyscale and found another unobstructed one that was simple to do.
---
I play rs3 and GW2 :)
---
I will be disappointed if the jade sea no longer has jade.
---
Yes, it's true it was a corruption as a result of Shiro. But the Luxons have since then embraced it, and it's now part of their culture and aesthetic.
---
I'd prefer to see it partially melted instead. Sandy beaches with islands of jade still intact.
---
&gt; Too tedious for me tho.
---
Thats probably the main reason, not many others do it, too.
---
These price spikes for refined mats are usually caused by big content updates and not many want to stand on the crafting station, refining mats for hours, while there is new content to explore.
---
Really hoping that one of these "event weeks" coming up will focus on dungeons. We need it.
---
I disagree. The goal of a sequel is to build upon its predecessor.
---
I want to see cantha 250 years later. More importantly, I want to see the Jade Sea.
---
Heard you bought him a code. Have my upvotes at least.
---
are you sure this wasn't just bad lag? i dont know id be surprised to find out someone from discretize hacks
---
The game does a lot to try to incentivize combat - you're slowed to a crawl.  Your skills are locked.  Enemies in newer content heavily favor opening with mobility-restricting condi.  I get that it keeps enemies from wandering all over the place, but... it feels like this game has *the worst* "I don't want to be in combat" space in all of video games.
---
And it's *definitely* petty - some enemies will hit a guardian twice or more.  Once to break Aegis, once to lock combat.  Some enemies with knockdowns will fire them twice in a row to steamroll a stunbreak. Some enemies seem to ignore mounts but attack while you're dismounting.  Mounts are glassier than a Weaver.  There aren't a lot of escape and evade skills.
---
One of the bigger design issues with the game is the incentive for combat - we're locked into it by having our mobility taken away, and nearly all post-core enemies are *walls* of hit points, placed in such a way that trying to kill just one to get out of combat is almost impossible - it's typically three, four, or more.  Post-core combat feels like a time sink - it's just endless sawing away at enemies that are needlessly thick. 
---
This ultimately incentivizes raid DPS builds.  I've played long enough to have grown out of Marauder and into Berserker; I build for maximum DPS not because I raid but because I want combat to be *over with* as quickly as possible.
---
I hope they change CoF not to shut down every time we finish a path. Jeez Louis...
---
Underwater steampunk!
---
The only things I leave for later is unidentified gear yo uget tons of those. 
---
Having all the space used in the bags only makes opening unid gear more annoying since you can't do it all in one go.
---
Don't tell anyone, but if you jump just right with a springer, you can get the entry prompt to popup for just enough time to click it.
---
Why not original human world instead of GW1 areas? I would be genuinely happy if we got some high-magitech postapocaliptic setting there.
---
&gt;There's a whole world, and you're really going to tell me it's ridiculous to find or explore a new part of it when so much of that world hasn't ever been touched? Are you actually for real right now?
---
Yes, that is what I am saying. There are other parts of the world, but the limitations set on exploration have been consistent. Unless something comes up that changes that (i.e. an island falling out of the sky, or discovering a new technology), it makes sense to be consistent. That's logical story telling.
---
totaly yes to 1, 2, 4, and 6. I recommend you try out a better build. There are some great solo-hero builds out there. The only thing i cant solo on my necro build are those damned coffeinated skritts. -.-
---
I hate this shit so much. There are spots you could literally stay in combat forever without dealing or taking damage. I've come across them while using tekkits currency farm routes in kourna and jahai. It usually happens when I lose aggro of a mob but I'm still close to them like on a ledge above or something and I have to either run away from that spot until I'm finally out of combat or relog. I wish the game had something where if you haven't actually had a combat related interaction for x seconds it puts you out of combat. Idk if this would affect pvp or wvw but they could make it non instanced pve only.
---
Oh with Zhaitan? That’s a good point. It could be really cool if it was all Largos stuff though
---
Well , that's true , just a mis-spoken term. But your definition of tester makes it sound as though they are a part of actual development decisions , which isn't the case. They're bottom of the totem pole , paid badly , and rarely actually listened to. Also , they usually get sacked right after crunch.
---
I've tried it. Couldn't do it. I've gotten the prompt for a micro second but tried mashing click.
---
But there has also been tonnes of LS updates that are heavily reliant on things established in Guild Wars 1 and, as someone that enjoys Guild Wars 2 because it isn't Guild Wars 1, those aspects absolutely detract from feeling fully invested.
---
LS3-1 and LS3-4 were related heavily to Guild Wars 1 (White Mantle). LS3-2 called back to the dwarves. LS3-6 story was heavily focused on Lazarus, which was basically GW1 fan service. And of course the raids at this time were entirely driven by Guild Wars 1 established villains and events. 
---
For LS4 there was heavy call backs to Sunspears from GW1 and later episodes rested heavily on Joko.
---
I don't mind throwbacks. How they are handled in Dragonfall is really good since they don't feel necessary to understanding the story. I don't think that has been the case for many previous story elements that reference GW1 though.
---
What do you mean up to date? They all look reasonable to me.
---
Technically, yes - but I dont believe the main cashflow mobile games have actually does stem from people on their way to work o.s. 
---
It's very much made from people that play lots in their dedicated free time and are either willing to spend insane amounts of money or just plain addicted
---
The miniatures on sale in the Gem Store seemed like a better idea at the time. I got the game over a year after it came out, so I still "needed" some account upgrades and such too. Though with how long it took to earn gold back then, perhaps 3200g is actually cheaper now.
---
put 2FA on and or Google Auth on with your phone. do the same to your email and link it to your phone. if anything happens use the phone...
---
&gt;  because you could move the UI, you don't need to worry about mapping every single button.
---
I think a big difference here is that in WoW you end up with 30+ buttons/skills.. whereas in GW2 you're limited to ~15 depending the class
---
&gt; Okay but can we talk about how ridiculous Rhainnon's Path is? Those bomb turrets wiped my party and I was the only one to make it through so I had to fight the mini-boss fight solo.
---
Good.
---
God forbid bads are creative with their class skills in order to solve a puzzle.
---
Let me tell you something: I recently did it on a Necro. I used the worm to get a head start on the run, and I made it.
---
If I can do it, so can you. Other classes have a much easier time.
---
&gt;It wasn't too bad but I was built for tanking so it was slow-going. 
---
Kinda your fault for running a bad built tbh.
---
&gt; Felt terrible for my allies lying their dead and waiting
---
Their fault for dying. And your fault for not waiting on them.
---
PoF had a really good overall story with Balthazar and the character progression of the commander. The maps were also pretty, if lacking replayability at the time. However I'll readily admit to so many story elements being lost on me, something that wasn't so prevalent in HoT.
---
Underwater stuff for our next destination would be good. Gotta get that underwater mount and finish out our collection. Largos seem interesting; a plot involving Largos and some big problem would be good IMO.
---
Yeah, it was my least favorite too.  The specific aesthetics of the two factions was neat, but the cities were awful and the actual campaign was lame.
---
That said, turtle shell armor...
---
What about damage? Could you make yourself do like 94 billion damage?
---
I'm a little stuck on the idea that in wow they play meta's but are clickers... How is that even doable. I had too many keybinds for my tiny hands to conveniently reach in wow. Had to double up with alt+whatever on everything less frequently used at one point. If they have gaming mice with extra buttons.. yet are clickers- *how. It makes no sense.* Can you even play gw2 as a clicker? everything goes too fast. Lose awareness for a second and you've exploded to something. 
---
If they are actually trying to click their way through I have no suggestions. But if they're semi used to keybinds and it's just an issue of wow and gw2 being similar yet not similar enough how about trying to play with action camera? Rather than playing it as 'sorta like wow' play it like a hack and slash. Gonna be impossible for clickers obviously. But if it's half a matter of perspective it's an idea.
---
Nah, Cantha is way more interesting
---
I'd actually play that, and I barely ever even have games on my phone
---
Yeah, no. Raid has no influence on the market, the amount of people who do it is negligible.
---
Are you sure? Raids seem popular.
---

Scepter animation on Guard and Ele is just so horrid to me, too ^(and giving my poor chars extreme tennis arms)
---
[Just use a spare key :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeLra3KGTeI)
---
I loved cantha. But let's go somewhere completely new. I want to original content, not rehashed content.. besides.. I'm usually disappointed with the 200 year changes they do to old content anyways.. they just destroy it too much to make it recognizable anyways
---
All gw1 areas in gw2 were horribly designed, imo. Hardly ever reminds of the old spots, usually have to see a sign or something to even know what we are seeing.
---
I never said anything about "actual development decisions", I said dev testers are expected to analyze and provide repro steps for the bugs they raise.
---
As for their treatment, while you're correct in general, it depends on studios. Dev testers in mine are listened to, I can tell you.
---
This is a weird narrative to push considering the only new race in GW2 is the Sylvari, and the plot of GW1 boils down to "every non human race is trying to enslave/genocide them", making humans entirely reactive, with the true center as Abbadon. "Disconnected, all over the place", every expansion of GW1 has fuck all to do with each other; "unrelatable", see Kormir.
---
I've actually grown to enjoy fighting thieves on my Weaver. Turns out when you have as many dodges as them, they don't do so well!
---
Unless it's new lore, never visited, or mentioned.
---
Wait, something like that really happened?
---
Sometimes I think "maybe we should have Cantha so we can stop getting topics about it", but then I realize we'd get "ANet did Cantha wrong, this is an outrage" topics instead.
---
And Cantha can be about Tengu returning to their homelands (as well as other races) and the tensions therein? The melting of the Jade Sea and it's impacts on the people now, regardless of the events with Shiro way back when? The potential impact of the sea dragon? You're able to come up with "fresh" ideas for a return to the BLH, but can't think of any for Cantha? Beyond that, what makes you so certain one region would have better storytelling than another?
---
They seem to be popular because there is a new kid on the block right now. But the amount of peeps who successfully clear every boss and therefore would have a real impact on the economy with all their bags ist incredibly low. Anet never released metrics but I bet my cup that not even 5% of the playerbase is raiding. Let alone killing all bosses and event every week.
---
And even if the amount of players is higher than you can get the same amount of bags multiple times per week by simply running loops in sw.
---
Ya, canthan people stranded by the sea dragon... Found another civilization and grew into something new over the 200 years sounds better.
---
Elite Mordrem Stalkers are those things.
---
  
---
Scaled events with them are pure horror.

---
Although I appreciate you playing devils advocate, bad lagg doesn't teleport the enemy player to your side of the PvP arena 1 second after the gates open.  Nothing in the entire game can do that other than cheating.
---
This. Absolutely. Let's go past the Brand or beyond the jungle. We have the means to do so, and there's obviously going to be civilizations living there when we arrive.
---
No u.
---
Found the racist. Yikes.
---
GW2 is only related to 1 by story and classes and that's it.
---
That's not the point of the post.  But to humor your question, they were in unranked.  Even if it were ranked, normal strategy can easily get cast to the wind when someone is cheating - especially when it catches people offguard.

What crushes for you?
---
Upvoting just because I miss playing dungeons.
---
Theoretically you could all just create chracters with the same backstory, as that (and picking the same paths within the Story) would make you all get the exactly same story. 
---
Since you can accept Story Progress you made in someone elses instance as your own (provided it is the same instance as your active one). 
---
Alternatively, you could just set a Point in the Personal Story where you'll "meet up", f.e. after youre all joining the same order. 
---
Or just Level up outside of the Story using Dungeons or simple Events - it's not a ig Task afterall...

Game crashes if i use just d9vk and arcdps crash if i use arcdps with d9vk
---
Eh, that's kind of a myopic viewpoint. There are plenty of mobile or f2p games that manage to make their money purely through player retention. Gamers have a long history of dismissing audiences or genres they don't really take seriously, so it's easy to forget that Candy Crush has been making millions for years without a waifu gacha.
---
So...you want something new...but not if it's based off a setting you never played.
---
Do you know what "new" means? Because it sounds like you're saying, "i want something new but not things that would be new to me".
---
That's not an answer to the question.
---
Can you use Skyscale to just hover at that spot?
---
Fuck yes this!! Tho I think the jade sea may have turned back to just the sea now and the forest might not be stone, either way we can swim and itl be great too explore.
---

Every single post of yours in this thread has been about how GW1 is the superior game, how it should only have human-centered storyline, how GW2 is "dying", how GW2 should have stayed exactly like GW1 was except for adding Z-axis, how continuing to play it is "stupid", and how the game caters to "furries" by having non-human races. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Stop hiding it; you completely hate GW2. Nothing you say can honestly be considered remotely valid.
---
Wait, just so I'm getting this straight. They have, what, too many buttons to press and no UI that tells them what button to press next and that's too complex to them? Assuming not all of your friends are playing core engineer with its meme of a rotation, a DPS rotation alone shouldn't be much of a challenge for WoW players, should it?
---
Or I love when you get stuck in combat somewhere like the Maw after closing the portals. Can't wp back, can't mount. So you're stuck dodging and weaving through trash mobs, hoping you make it back in time before the boss gets melted.
---
&gt; Also
---
You really shouldn't talk about yourself that way. Get a therapist.
---
&gt; but
---
The most fun charrs I ever met are the ones that like Poo (yea, the teddy  bear from Disney) and command Zergs on the SBI.
---
I prefer the ones at the left panel tho.
---
&gt; But that's the point.
---
So you want us to slog through the depressing nature of Cantha after having already slogged through the depressing nature of a Joko-ruled Elona?
---
No, that isn't it. They can't move the UI around to be more comfortable to skill click, I think.
---
Ah yes, GameStop, Target and Walmart are definitely dying retailers...
---
Because anywhere else in GW1 has looked so much better 250 years later?
---
Weaver and tempest are both a lot of fun. I play weaver if I’m by myself or for fractals, and tempest if I’m doing group events cuz of the aoe capabilities. Getting the weaver rotation down can be difficult at first but if you’re playing sword (BttH is best imo) the rotation becomes very smooth and fun. Eles definitely top 3 faves.
---
&gt; it says right in your link both are acceptable
---
End of point.
---
I have always liked ayins guides more.
---
&gt;Dragon Arena- Fight waves of enemies with increasing difficulty.
---
Hopefully infinite difficulty. Really want that.
---
GW1 referenced events that came hundreds or even thousands of years before the events of that game though. And because it all started with GW1, you couldn't have possibly experienced those events firsthand. It's called worldbuilding, a world doesn't just plop into existence with no history or background for why things are the way they are. Yes, GW2 references GW1 events because it's part of its history, that's just good storytelling. They could go the WoW route and just retcon or erase entire character histories as the story progresses. The dwarves mostly dying out, the last of the Mursaat making an appearance, the effects of Joko's rule in Elona, all of that continuity wouldn't be questioned if GW2 was the first title in the series.
---
You're only bringing up that there's so much historical lore you missed out on because it came before and you can't experience it in this particular title. But history makes sense to incorporate and isn't lazy writing nor "rehashing." It's consistent and explains why things are the way they are in the present.
---
Dragon Arena sound like exactly what I was hoping for, enemies scaling in difficulty round by round. So, hopefully, fun with a group and a real challenge if you attempt it solo. Fingers crossed ...
---
I can't do it on my Skyfail :(
---
Lol you mean Pooh
---
Bolt to the heart. One of the traits in the air trait line. My other faves are Mirage and kind of a tie between Guardian and Engi.
---
Looks super fun. 
---
As an English major, however, the comma splicing and weird sentence structure used by the author pains me... Especially for a "journalist." &lt;.&lt;
---
I have said why. The experience is the reward. Having material rewards brings about dopamine-driven gameplay; do something, get something mentality. Ideally, players would play a game just to play the game. Because MMO's need to generate consistent profit, they want dopamine-driven behaviors so that people spend money. I am not saying Gw2 can exist without rewards, because it can't, so stop arguing for Gw2 in this context because that is not what I am talking about. MMO's can not ideally exist in the current world we live in because money, I get that. This is for games that do not need further development or a revenue stream (the old, buy-a-finished-game, no dlc, no achievements type game)
---
For difficulty I’d say it’s quite high. One thing is in terms of hardware you’d want to have a multi button mouse for quicker attunement swaps or closer key bonds to your left hand because reaching to the function keys isn’t common and combat happens really quickly. The other thing your health pool is really low. You gotta chose the more defensive talents and skills and stats or you might get got frequently. You can do a lot of damage but depending on how many people you’re playing with determines tradeoffs in those areas. Good luck!
---
Best path ever, it helps you catch up with your sleep schedule
---
Yes, thats why raid selling guilds exist.
---
outwear? hmm
---
&gt; id rather see a completely rehashed cantha
---
If this happens, the people howling for Cantha will instead howl with rage at how their nostalgia was not respected. That's probably a fate worse than having your taxes audited.
---
&gt;if the new designers have at it, its gonna be all purple branded dragon giant vine explody airships,
---
This is a stupid thing to say. What the fuck? We already dealt with both of those dragons; there's no reason for any of this to happen. Why would you say such a ridiculously stupid thing?
---
&gt;charrs / nonhuman races that are not relatable, and lightning bolts and half-assed asura plots
---
Not relatable in your opinion. Honestly, you sound like a VV alt account. If GW2 is that bad, why are you playing it?
---
you know, that he owns a permanent bank contract and he s keeping all the bags with him cause he will get them again and this way they just stack instead of poping up somewhere in the inventory again and again?
---
I dont understand these people who don't want us to explore old gw1 regions like cantha. I want to know what happend, I want to see how they've changed and most of all I want that sweet sweet nostalgia trip!!
---
Thank you for all the great info!
---
Ah gotcha, thank you
---
Warhorn 5 + we heal as one + F5 merge = 24 might, fury and unblockable attacks.
---
Ha ha you so funny!  I bet you think people equip stunbreaks and CC in open world too, don't you?
---
As long as *all* of Cantha is underwater, and we get mounted under water combat. Because sharks with lasers on their heads!
---
If we get a sort of Runescape ["Pest Control"] (https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Pest_Control), I am saying farewell to sleeping.
---
Now I’m doubting if I’ll play one lol
---
Waves of enemies *-*
---
Ok it works but that's not our job to do it each time we have to change pages. Not user friendly :/
---
&gt; thanks
---
Me, but with Crucible of Eternity, smushing my face on the forcefield. 
---
***Lemme. In. Anet. Please.***
---
A lot of PvE content ends up being like this.  You need to do an event but that event needs another one to complete in order to spawn.  Then the first event needs a minimum of 3 people.  You just walk away at that point.
---
I get the feeling that English isn't the author's first language.
---
There has been cases a gm saw a video and took actions. 
---
But often the reddit page admins tell to censor the name to avoid a witchhunt.
---
lol - OP is clueless.
---
who cares about charr and norn in gw2, they are just here for mmo fluff - big drunk dumbo guys and grumpy kitties. this isn't GW1 when these races had meaning
---
I saw where they told me where thunderhead keep was. Did it remind me of it? Not really.
---
Then you certainly wont be a fan of attunements and especially conjured weapons.
---
The bleed was useful, but now we’re back to seeing only two or 3 mounts for engagements: bun and skyscale (with raptor at times)
---
Well I guess there’s my answer then, thank you kind stranger
---
I want drops
---
Dungeons joined the crowd of dead content with PvP, WvW, and things to do as a guild.  Anet only cares about LW and is purely on maintenance mode with everything else.
---
Dungeons died when fractals came out.  PvP when ESL pulled.  WvW when GvG support was declined and power creep set in.  Guild content when they said they have no plans to ever add more guild missions.
---
just join a legendary bounty train
---
Wiki has a summary.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_All#Living_World_Season_3
---
Play through the GW1 mission, then check out the part in GW2 that covers the same area. That part in Thunderhead Peaks--even just on the map--is very reminiscent of the GW1 area, particularly the Dwarven town and the keep.
---
I want to go to Madagascar so I can move it move it
---
Please don't put tasks on real-time priority unless you know what you are doing. This would put the task above input detection, which is pretty much never anything you want. Setting it to High should be enough.
---
&gt;⁠define gameplay to range over zergs, havoc and roaming at least (perhaps also gvg and dueling) and test all new features in these
---
Would be nice to have an npc who can explain these for newer players in a help text. The problem wouldn’t be the npc themselves, but going about the text in a way that’s helpful
---
As someone with similar issues I can empathize. The UI in this game is god awful. Raid frames top left and UI being stuck on the bottom is not a good feeling. WoW devs are competent enough to support addons so a lot of WoW players are used to having their UI be more centralized around their characters. I personally don't like having to look all around the screen for info that I want but there is literally no other option in this game. There are also no boss timers or any way to turn off friendly AOE. There is no solution to this problem currently.
---
Isn’t the deal that Anet won’t go to Cantha as long as they have Chinese servers?
---
I don’t quite understand it, but that’s what I keep hearing...
---
I’d rather the other items move to the second slot if anything.  Don’t encourage adding extra clicks if you can’t be bothered to slow down and double check before buying.
---
OP, you live in France. You're looking at the vendors in the US. Those vendors are everywhere in the US, every town has one, and every city has multiple. 
---
The link for France is here: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#France-physical
---
And yes, it looks like only Micromania sells gem cards in France. Now your complaint looks much more reasonable.
---
Watching "WvW veterans" strangling their own gamemode has got to be one of the most morbidly fascinating things. And now we can watch the very same thing with raids and their raiders as well.
---
Stunbreaks? CC? Never heard of it :D
---
That's impossible, how does a RBMK reactor explode?
---
You are delusional, get this man to the infirmary.
---
This is CoF even back in 2012, tbh. Better hope that mesmer in your 1 mesmer + 4 greatsword warrior group knows the trick to blink past the closed gate for a millisecond.
---
I know but I was expecting a new mount license where I could pay at least 1200 for a single skin out of the bunch if I really wanted it or roll with 400 gamble
---
&gt; Welcome to PoF. Everything wants to cripple, stun, slow, bleed, torment you
---
Don't forget blind. Between sand lions, scarabs, and return of the dust mites, perma-blind meta is all over PoF.
---
i know, that's why i was being ironic about it. Whenever he wants to open all those containers he's barely going to have any much space left to work with.
---
Mount races are always fun but Hoelbrak has some weird issues when it comes to mounts. The whole east entrance area is off limits and halfway up the grand steps there is a raised edge that will stop you completely if you don't jump over it. I hope this makes use of how tall Hoelbrak is in some way.
---
What staff are they using?
---
How does this work exactly? Does the level 80 start the PoF story and the level 2 joins? Do you need to complete the entire story, or just get to the part where it says the Raptor is unlocked?
---
Ah I bet those will come down the line once they have released more skins. If it's of the quality of the first one i'm looking forward to seeing it. The 1st skyscale skin has a lot of welcomed effects.
---
&gt;placed in such a way that trying to kill just one to get out of combat is almost impossible
---
I could probably live with the extra post-elite-spec HP bump if many mobs didn't emphasize positioning and movement as much. The fight takes up more space, increasing the chance of drawing another critter into it, and that's before PoF aggro range comes into it.
---
what else are you going to use your thousands upon thousands of wvw mastery points on............
---
I would say that among the other currencies you can use to buy obsidian (Unbound or Volatile Magic, guild commendations etc.) karma should convert to gold rather inefficiently. Using karma instead of using other currencies should net you more gold in the long run.
---
It does. My secondary hope is that with the next license they’ll add in some warclaw skins too, as I ain’t about to drop 2000 for an ability in WvW that might get yet another nerf (dismount skill) and a next-to-useless PvE aspect (wish they kept the bleed in PvE, would be nice to see different engaging mounts)
---
Personally, Cantha cities were my most-hated maps in GW1 universe
---
My gamble is weak...as in I love to, BUT I lose more than I win. -.- 
---
Thank you for that option though!!! :)
---
With a name like Steven Weber? I mean sure it's possible, but it seems more likely he's just a poor writer, who, it seems, has a great love, that love being for, and his heart wholely enraptured by, that most noble of punctuation marks, the comma.
---
Sadly my account got hacked and I don’t feel like getting all my stuff again. amethyst aegis or elemental swords and what not. :(
---
:O
---
/blinks  I will have to check that out!!! Thank you for that idea!!! :)
---
I think the problem people have is mostly how long it took to get here. Between GW1 and GW2 there was an article called "The Movement of the World" or something to that effect which explained what happened to Tyria, Cantha, and Elona in the 250 years between games. Players expected to see the fallout of those things and then to expand their horizons.
---
...but here were are seven years later and we've only been to Elona. Now we're stuck in this position where a lot of players want to go back to Cantha because we've been told what's going on there, and a lot of players want to see something new because it's been seven frickin' years and we still haven't really left the locations GW1 took place in.
---
If you told 2008 me that in 2019 Guild Wars 2 *still* wouldn't have gone to any new continents or outside the known world, I'm not sure I would have believed you. Why even make a second game that's so much more ambitious in scope if we don't even see anything new? 
---
At this point I'm just keen to see whatever is cooked up. Anet works at their pace and hopefully this latest chapter puts the kibosh on dragon stuff for a while so we can explore some new ideas.
---
What?
---
I was triggered by the improper nomenclature. "Hoelbrakian Norns" NOPE.
---
The proper way to write this is "norn from Hoelbrak". Hoelbrakian isn't a thing. The plural form of norn is norn. No capital N is needed.
---
I just want 2 things
---
1: Player housing.
---
2: A story that doesn't involve a BBEG corrupting everyone to be in its army and the Asura come up with a technology to fix all our problems.
---
It used to be blah blah blah...
---
You know what it reads? "I'm poor and jelly". Thats what.
---
Well to be fair it was a pretty dumb OP. Let's face it if that was really the most important fix that needed doing in the game we would all be in a great place. The items have icons when you buy them so it's not really hard to click the correct one. Also if you are doing it time and time again and not learning from your mistakes....
---
it's not a witch hunt if there is video evidence or other conclusive evidence of the cheating, a witch hunt is more like if someone made a post without any proof (not necessarily lying though) claiming that a certain player was cheating or otherwise breaking rules.
---
I worry they would find a reason to cover Kaineng in goo like they did Elona this time.  It was already a pretty grimy place, and I'm seriously sick of maps covered in black sludge.
---
He's in the endgame now
---
I've gotten it with the griffin and was able to hit the option for exp but it just said I couldn't enter
---
Could you possibly copy and paste this build for me? I main Chrono power dps but don't enjoy the squish of GC. I'd like to try this out. Cheers
---
You're looking at support builds if they include a shield. Greatsword brings nothing useful for a support build.
---
* focus - pulls groups of enemies together to be cleaved quickly, can be traited to provide reflects
---
* sword (offhand) - has a strong CC skill, a block, and a high-damage phantasm
---
* pistol - has a strong CC skill and a high-damage phantasm
---
I mean it's a sequel. Of course they are going to build ontop of things from the other games lore. It's called world building. While GW2 does at times run past the player if they aren't in the know, it more often then not elucidates beforehand pretty well. 
---
PoF was fantastic from a lot of standpoints. I dunno how you could call it unnecessary or something just because there are a few moments and vistas that are clearly nods to the original, those are good things, it's called depth, and consistency. Not fan service.
---
That is not build templates
---
Horn set is a helmet armor skin
---
Skyscale mount pack is going to be a bundle of 5 Skyscale skins for 2000 gems or whatever
---
Wuut, thats pretty much inventory swapping xD
---
If you're after higher dps, bringing a firebrand is almost always less dps than either the alternative of Ren/Chrono/DHs with fmw or double Chrono depending on encounter. Firebrand is pretty much only meta on VG, Sab, and CA.
---
Can also find some of these outfits on the trading post, but some of those can get reaaaally pricey.
---
Even without kits there are the toolbelt skills
---
These people. They don't want world building, they want one time spinoffs totally unrelated to the world that this game stands on.
---
Honestly the population is so small right now I can tell usually someone's lying just by account name and if I've seen them in matches.
---
Or at the very least don't make the defend event last so long
---
This is why I like the new style of dialogue forcing us to stay in a certain radius of the npc speaking, instead of being able to just spam through it like with the personal story. Helps us retain maybe a little more of the story details.
---
Damn dude, destroyed my whole world right there,  now I feel I bought a character slot for no reason
---
If China's influence was strong enough to remove the Cantha district from DR, it's more than strong enough to make Cantha an unlikely stop on the commander's world tour.
---
I also dont personally care for the weeb service that Cantha would create. But it would be a good way to pull old players back into the game so I have mixed feelings about going there
---
How dare people have different opinions than me!
---
That is unlikely to happen since weapon swap is also used for dropping bundles which includes ele conjured weapons and engi kits along with many environmental weapons. So weapon swap needs to remain usable while in combat.
---
With a good enough interface for build templates you can achieve the same thing using two templates.
---
Yeah it'll probably be like [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warclaw_Frontline_Mount_Pack)
---
I'm ok with that
---
Couldn't agree more. And while we share our frustrations: Grenth area in Dragonfall. For the love of me I can't slow down for one second, let alone stop and look around (admire the view? Appreciate the map artists' work?) without being sieged from all directions. Ranged trash mobs are the worst. Not every map and every corner of the map has to be filled with enemies, Anet, you know.
---
I actually prefer the way they play. Since if you want to do well with ele and engie you HAVE to swap attunements and kits, it is even easier for, for example, trigger "swap weapon" sigils. I feel it is a lot more natural than with all the other professions (I only constantly switch with mesmers)
---
However a counter could be said that with additional difficulties/tiers, that could bring in more people into raiding, and thereby possibly (and hopefully) increase the raiding team and their resources
---
Im really glad you volunteered to do it for me. Fortunately some of my guild mate did it for me. Thanks anyway
---
One of these years we will be able to explore...I hope lol
---
But there already are basically no releases. It's by all means a dead gamemode. If instead of one wing every 9 months it becomes one wing every 11 months, but they get repeatable challenge modes for them to progress wipe on - isn't it clinically insane to refute that? Not to mention that a lower difficulty in addition to the higher one would get them more players, and more players means a higher priority for resource allocations, meaning more frequent releases.
---
Fighting difficulties is like fighting firefighters because their fire engine blocks the street for the pizza delivery guy. I mean, yes. That's right. But don't you wanna live?
---
Ouch. I had to start over on a new account as well. I didn't lose much though, 1 set of 15K armor and access to the [Canthan Targe](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Canthan_Targe).
---
^ truth
---
I had another thought, since I know you don't have to have an alternative main hand sword to carry over to your weapon swap, but in theory you could have one with seperate stats, like a berserker's or otherwise for  more DPS when swapped, I know it'd be more in the way of dumping funds in but perhaps it could throw in some options to get the best out of a build?  
---
Also, since you seem pretty knowledgeable about this setup, what sigil would you recommend I have on my offhand focus (I've looked around at some builds but most don't go into detail on alternative weapons), if you happen to know of any good ones that'd work well?
---
As far as I know, no. Things like skill activation needs to go through the server. This is why when you have a lot of lag and you try to use a skill you just the skill icon blinking at you and doing nothing. It is because the client is waiting for the server to respond. There is also the other skill lag that can happen when the server isn't able process all the skill activations fast enough such as when there are many people all trying to use skills at the same time such as at a big meta event or in large WvW fights.
---
 
---
Dodging seems to be a mix. The actual movement part is still client side but whether or not you evaded is still server side. Again, this can be observed if often encounter high ping or ping spikes. On your screen you will see that you've perfectly avoided the attack but moments later you get hit. Especially noticeable with knockback/launch attacks.
---
Thing get even more complicated by the fact that the game also does some lag compensation. I think that is up to 300ms but this from memory of a dev post from years ago.
---
I want Cantha because it'll give ANet a reason to create Asian faces.
---
Request granted.
---
I liked so much Kaineng City, and I hope that one day, we'll be able to wander again in Kaineng.
---
What lore Janthir could have had was ruined by hiding Saul in a raid.
---
That's cool, thanks :)
---
There's a spot to stand on the teleporter that keeps the box open.
---
Idk I mean even if it was done would it be fair? (Wouldn't that make it OP?) Very debatable but from a personal standpoint I'd extremely enjoy this, I main ele the whole appeal for me behind it was the variety in its kit, adding more skills would open a whole new playstyle, imagine the potential you get with 40+ skills is extreme and beyond frightening but in terms of balancing I can't imagine how this can go, I love the idea but it probably wouldn't that much accepted...
---
agree, It was ok with warclaw as it is a special mount. But why go with packs for a pve mount and not just add them to new mount licence? I wanted to spend 1200 for one, but now I will have to pay 2000 for one? (as I wont use others) is this some new strategy ? :|
---
because gyros and turrets are already working so good?  
---
better introduce another useless summon.
---
Just give us Tony Stark elite spec. Taimi can have her own exosuit, but we cannot? BUUUUU!
---
We want a round ground so the new area is west of the jungle and east of the desert, unless... anet are flat earthers.
---
Love Weaver vs Thieves. Herald also makes quick work of them.
---
Sure, they can dash away, but Herald dashes are almost all targeted and meant to close that gap. Stealth? Facet of Darkness -&gt; Gaze of Darkness. Swiftness? Facet of Elements. Gonna Death Blossom at me? Facet of Light -&gt; Infuse Light + Facet of Chaos, then I also have a nifty knockback for when you're done spinning around.
---
With Elona we kinda covered a lot of human territory, Cantha would just mean even more humans and human gods related stuff while leaving all those pockets in the north and east empty. I know gw1 players want Cantha but... I'd rather give the human driven plot a rest for a bit.
---
One thing the last episode showed is that &gt;!Elder Dragons aren't inherently evil and one of the two personalities of Kralk we saw inside his body actually supported Aurene, chances are all other elder dragons have this dual personality conflicting with each other ongoing, so we could go to the far shiverpeaks to kind of... remove the bad side out of Jormag without having to kill him!&lt;
---
i remember guesting to Blackgate just to do Orr content
---
What happened to the days of stripping the hackers down before deleting everything they own and theor entire account once you've commited suicide on their main?
---
Don't get to excited. This a festival. It can't be challenging.
---
Someone is caught committing a crime on camera Vs. the crowd who is watching said footage to see what it was
---
See the difference?
---
You can say that people benefit for this, you can call the leaker a hero, you can say that it really doesnt matter, and who care. The difference is that a crime was committed and it was unethical to violate an agreement. 
---
It is **LITERALLY** black and white.
---
Omggg, I was thinking that too
---
Depends on what you mean by "complete". Do you mean just get through all the story instances? Fully unlocking all the mounts? Getting the meta-achievement for every story arc? Getting all the achievements?
---
For me, zones take precedence before lore. Good lore in a boring zone isn't as playable as boring lore in a good zone.
---
I don't like snowy zones because they're like the deserts we've been having for the last 2 years, but even less variable and populated. I don't like norn and their hurr-durr-spirit-booze-I'm-so-cool culture either.
---
I'm okay with brown mountains and occasional caves and lakes, but I like more fantastical landscapes more. Also, I don't like charr and their hurr-durr-mah-steampunk-such-warrior-much-wow-let's-war culture either.
---
I wouldn't mind underwater zones and underwater creatures - they have a lot of potential and would be a serious shift in paradigm. With how well ANet pulled off mounts (including the z-axis ones), I'm sure they can make an enjoyable "underwater" expansion with a couple clever tricks that would fix the common issues of actual underwater zones. I believe in them.
---
No they IP/Hardware ban. There have been numerous people on here complaining of a ban where their brother/cousin/aunt used their computer and got them banned too.
---
But if it is endless.
---
Wait, so those aren't zones I have to explore for 100% too? I just started playing and was like, GEEZ this is going to take forever!
---
But it isn't a *direct* sequel. It's set over two centuries later. I'd understand the referencing if this was a Guild Wars 1 expansion but it isn't.
---
World building shouldn't presume experience with a different game, unless it is minor referencing and not of importance to the overall story. For a while, Guild Wars 2 has been incredibly reliant on many events in Guild Wars 1 without fully elaborating and emphasising the significance of these events within the game itself. Depth and consistency should be accessible to all players and not those that played a previous game set far in the past with an entirely different structure and playstyle.
---
Not sure how you can seriously suggest that there hasn't been fan derive to Guild Wars 1. The entirety of Wing 4 and LS3ep6 was absolutely playing to the wants of Guild Wars 1 players while ignoring a coherent or interesting story for players of Guild Wars 2 that didn't want to play a lobby co-op RPG while games were progressing to open world MMOs (which is what GW2 is!).
---
Games top doesn't sell gems
---
Just because people want Cantha does not mean they do not want the other stuff. Quite simple really.
---
Finally something to be happy about in PvE. Took long enough. Just playing PvP for hours and thats the gw2 routine. New information looks quite cool until now.
---
Most of them doesn't sell gems anymore and a few of them doesn't exist anymore
---
You're definitely 150% right with that.  They can't even write GW2 lore without expecting you to have been apart of every DLC.  That's definitely a really good point.
---
As a power rev, what's condi clear?
---
Just give lunar new year more love. Give us a lunar new year map, like the zephyrite map, and add new free faces (like elonian faces) during the holiday.
---
Thank you! We were glad to get some good fights, this past week has been very blobby. Not much fun when you're running 10-15 at best.
---
Ok, contrary to everyone else, I don't think ele is *that* hard to play. I main a Tempest and whilst it's definitely squishier than my reaper, it's way more fun imho. I actually had more difficulty with Firebrand and mesmer, because all the skills are the same damn colour. The attunements make a lot of sense: fire for DPS/burning, water for healing, air for CC/DPS, earth for bleed/defense. 
---
 I have mine set up as a Fresh Air Auramancer because you get a bit more survivability from auras and the damage is still good. With Fresh Air (the air grandmaster trait) your air attunement resets after a crit, so you can overload, drop a huge AoE storm, switch to fire and crit immediately, then go back and air overload again, or use whichever attunement you need. 
---
 I love it, I've played ever profession/elite but ele/tempest is my favourite. The AoE is amazing and flashy, the animations are cool, it's thematically badass and you can smash stuff with a lightning hammer.
---
Yeah thanks that's definitely my point apart from the US retailer I can find only 2 shop selling gems and not in €
---
But on the other hand I can buy plenty of gem on g2a wich isn't a official retailer
---
you know you can just walk out of the cannon barrages right? dodging out of every single attack not needed in the slightest.
---
A golem you climb into like Scruffy, a battle mech elite spec.
---
Thank you! We are fortunate to have some good drivers and folks in the guild are committed to getting better. I'm super green, so it's good to have experience people to follow.
---
Probably because dumb races like Charr or Norn won't be able to figure out advanced tech like Golems. /s

you mean like them kneeling, taking aim with a red line pointing from them to their target?
---
But what about Asurian asurans? How do you feel about them?
---
Thank you for that, I loved the comment, trying it out right now actually
---
Ugh, yes. Path of Fire was one biiiig GW1 trip that's just boring and you feel like you are missing 80% of interactions if you never played GW1.   
---
We don't need another expansion of that.
---
TO is legit one of my fav fractals and I run it on the higher scale fractals.
---
Underwater does suck, to be fair.
---
healing spring never leaves my bar... i know there are better options but fuck 'em
---
Who said anything about dodging out of every single attack?
---
And you can do collection to get ascended versions (and upgraded skins) for the new weapons.
---
Personally I LOVE fix-r-up-er... (upgrade skin ascended version)
---
Depends how you use it. Burnt toast is objectively burnt toast, but you'd use burned for a sentence like "Remember that time I burned my finger when I grabbed the side of the frying pan like an idiot when trying to make pancakes?"
---
It's a bit more nuanced than simple copy-paste.
---
They’ve honestly been better than any subscription based MMO I’ve played too.
---
Agreed, making pre mandatory would wind up screwing a lot of players out of rewards.  There's no clean and easy solution to the leech problem.  I did a couple of orbits of the world boss train and just couldn't stand it socially so I opted out.
---
A friend was complaining about the state of the game population recently and their opinion is it's the toxic effect of the WoW influx combined with an "aging" population - a lot of players have been at it awhile; we log in for new content or to farm objectives and generally don't engage unless something catches our attention.
---
I dunno what the solution is - but the core maps are quiet and the LWS4 maps are full of players complaining bitterly about timegating (still.).  Good in-game conversation can still be had but there does seem to be less of it these days.
---
I really didn't expect people to be this serious about a silly complaint. Kinda confused by the reception to be honest.
---
So basically an asura elite on steroids.
---
Support in gw2 is verry good
---
So true. And their hinted kinship to Kodan, plus how the reckless "personal legend/being a hero" ideology contrasts with the need to survive, to support the norn people as a whole.  
---
Norn are long overdue for some lore spotlight.
---
let me on your acc for 2 mins, i'll clean that right up.
---
TT is still hard, but imo that is because of mechanics and buggy behavior, not the lack of dps.
---
Talk about moving the goalposts...
---
they recently(meta-event update) increased the drop(by like 2-5 per) on mosaics from bounties, not sure if your numbers reflect that or not, because i don't do them enough.
---
I mean, Elder Dragons not being inherently evil has been something of a plot point since day one last I checked - they've always been presented more as forces of nature than entities acting with any sort of malice. It would appear that they only started to develop evil tendencies once they started consuming magic that would normally go to other Elder Dragons, which is further supported by the events of the last episode. Before that, while they did attack settlements and corrupt people, that was just their way of gathering more magic to eat.
---
As such, by my assessment even with the "bad side" of one of the other Elder Dragons removed (likely in the form of Aurene absorbing any magic that they aren't inherently aligned with) they would still pose an existential threat to Tyria by merit of trying to consume any magic they can get their hands on and corrupting anything that gets too close, which isn't part of their "evilness" - it's just what they *do*. The only reason Kralkatorrik allowed this willingly is because he realized it was the only way to make the pain stop, and we had to mostly kill him to get to that point anyway.
---
I'm kinda tired of this gw1 fanservice bs. PoF content was pretty bad outside of story instances IMO.
---
But its gw2.
---
Unlike Charr or Norn, "human" lore isn't just one piece of lore. It was basically the whole world before GW2. If we ignore the dragon lore and their retcons, 90% of lore in this game is human lore.
---
Cantha has several plot threads that are unresolved, has multiple culturally distinct, unique regions and is full of mystery. 
---
Elona was boring AF.. they wrote Jokos off way too soon and the entire continent was the same brandead/undead/Joko things. There was little to no variety and all of the sense of wonder these zones had in GW1 was just gone.. homogenized and made Orr 2.0
---
I fear that's exactly what would happen to Cantha, but if they'd manage to not screw this up then it'd be a really amazing and diverse expansion. Way more than any Charr or whatever other area they'd uncover on the map.
---
As long as I never have to see an Elder Dragon ever again I'm fine with wherever we go though.
---
Praise Rngesus! Now how much did it cost to get it?
---
one guild commendation, or just doing SW chest farm gets you a TON.
---
That would be neat. But I'm a sucker and just want a starscale skin.
---
Take my upvote
---
Did you get the upgraded ascended version of the lightsaber? You unlock the regular one by starting the Holosmith specialization, but get an "upgraded" version after a collection. Same with all specialization weapons in both expansions.
---
I would recommend another slot for weekly key-farmers/starter unlocks anyways.
---
Over the entire lifespan of ecto gambling? No comment. Over today? I started at 1900 :P
---
probably from SW chest farm, they drop like candy. Also you may have been getting clovers directly now that they added in more reward tracks in WvW/PvP and some other sources like Magic Warped Bundles.
---
They certainly couldn't have gotten very far in wow if they clicked skills, or not used the most common QERF + modifiers for abilities.   
---
And it's the absolute standard for most games, so they'll just have to bind these 4 buttons. Plus there are two more mouse side buttons.
---
My mum made me 2(blue and pink) before she passed. Love the heck out of them. She was unable to finish the black one but the 2 i got have a special place near my pc and i totally flip out when someone wants to pick them up or my cat gets to close lol.

---
For those interested the pattern
---
I get that, but GW2 shouldn't be all about continuing GW1's human plots forever. The entire HoT revolved around a race that didn't exist in GW1, PoF around humans, maybe the next step could be a whole new plot involving one of the untouched races.
---
Norn are big and dumb and in no way is this opinion racist.
---
-Asura
---
Tbh, I kinda want more racism ingame. Coming from gw1 where "Bookah" was dropped incessantly.
---
No longer have access to the email I had my account on. So I can't play either. I miss my ss necro

It's not visual but it'll tell you everything you need to know.
---
Given how much GW1 lore they fucked over, ignored, or ruined, your statement of believing GW2 is a "GW1 memorial fest" is funny.
---
We're constantly going to the same lands, true, but the lore is barely connected anymore.
---
there are no gyros anymore, they got reworked into moving wells.  
---
also how do turrets work fine? they are the most single useless skillset in the whole game. hell, they can't even crit in pve. LMAO
---
&gt; Narrator: They totally were.
---
Are you complaining about AI or balance? Make up your mind plz.
---
I actually had an idea for this. Focus for Elite Spec weapon. Like some kind of remote control. Have a golem pet like a Ranger and replace tool belt skills with golem command skills. Glyphs for utility skills.
---
Extremely cost ineffective.
---
you can open that while its closed too
---
Better way:
---
https://imgur.com/a/ef0Rogl
---
I'd rather Cantha over the underwater content
---
Just dodge rectangles, dodge wedges, stack green circles, kite red circles, kill Quartermasters, strip boons, cleanse condis LOL 4Head
---
The other way was to use the Browse Properties menu to view the key information: https://imgur.com/a/ef0Rogl
---
Wow, so it's possible after all 😃
---
Seems like 6 world-ending super dragons wouldn't all be located in such a relatively small amount of real estate.
---
Break out of the map with some crazy shit size story
---
The elder dragons shouldn't be confined to Tyria as we know it
---
Its the equivalent of westeros which makes up about 15% of their world
---
Anet can essentially build an entire new game with crazy surprises on the other side of the world
---
Long forgotten gods? Lost civilizations or those who barely survived *(the great filter of the elder dragons cycle, like the Jotuns*)? Super advanced species? New threats? Shit, maybe even a part of the world that the elder dragons have completely decimated - OR the previous generation of elder dragons?! DRAGON CIVIL WAR (in the past)?!
---
Anet can go ridiculous distance because all they have to do is expand the world map art itself. The distance being traveled doesn't need to be filled 
---
UNNNLLIIMMIIITTEEDD SSTTOOORRRIIIEESS\~!!!!
---
Google gw2 keybinds, right now my forward is W, strafe left is E and strafe right is R and I have keybinds all around those
---
both is a problem when done wrong and after doing it 2 times wrong on engi, why should there be a 3rd time?
---
Hot take - the human gods are the *real* threat to existence and Balthazar was just chaotic good.
---
`this` refers to the object calling the code, except in cases of `.call()`, `.bind()`, or `.apply()`, or in arrow functions.
---
I don't care if his name is sexy serpent squarepants, I want that model. I freaking love underwater dragons and I NEED to see the model.
---
According to Tyrian globes west of the jungle is just sea. Unless you mean super far west where there's islands and stuff.
---
The entire turret category is a dumpster fire.
---
Turning radius makes them useless against anything that moves.
---
They have low health and massive hitboxes.
---
They cannot crit, but can *be* crit and can take conditions, but cannot benefit from boons.
---
Years ago, before HoT, ArenaNet heavily nerfed turrets because they were problematic in PvP. This was before elite specs came along and disrupted PvP even more than turrets ever did. They ruined the entire category to such a high extent that bunker engineer went from popular to worthless overnight.
---
They have never touched turrets since then besides the overcharge change, which makes turrets worse if you intend to deploy them for more than a few seconds. Before HoT up until now, they've never revisited the category. 
---
They've been worthless for literal years, dude.
---
Maybe we are trapped here...
---
I can only do the entry prompt glitch on CoE or sigh
---
I think it would be interesting for them to have a government like Ba Sing Se, that actively suppresses outside information and makes the citizens think that nothing bad is going on outside of the walls.
---
(Whispers) “Kuunavang”
---
Wait, isn't the earth flat??? /s
---
Just the thought of adding another AI oriented spec in a game where AI isn't very good makes me shiver.
---
Then we have turrets and old gyros as perfect precedent of bad implementation.
---
The Radial menu has made the growing mount list so much more bearable for me :) can't recommend it enough
---
https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk/issues/21#issuecomment-504426736
---
Yeah, why can't they go bother Cantha?
---
Jahai Bluffs was very well done.
---
Steam can be hit and miss, I managed to get a good one a few years back, managed to get a full refund before refunds were a thing.
---
No, people have to see your weapons. So they can know your weapon set and ideally, your bıuild especially in pvp, wvw
---
Yup, it's sad that my shield hides Mawdrey. Stuff's popping already anyway, so I don't care about that part.
---
This will, however, likely need to be disabled for PvP, because readability blah-blah.
---
Try one more !!!!!
---
There's actually a lore reason why. You see, all of the Bloodstones are in that small area, and the dragons could feel their magic remained despite devouring the rest of the world's. So, that's where the dragons gathered at the end of the last cycle. They went to sleep once they realized they couldn't get the magic.
---
I kinda get the excitement people have for Cantha, but mostly not. I get much more excited about the idea of exactly the areas you pointed out.
---
To solve half of that you don't even need to make addons a thing. Just do what Swtor does and let you move certain frames around on the screen. You can already move the minimap, just let use move some of the other things too. My biggest annoyance with this game is that your own health and your targets health are on opposite ends of the screen. It would be so much easier to stay alive while still watching boons and conditions if they were closer.
---
Thanks!
---
GW2's art style is gorgeous and just the thought of seeing Cantha in GW2 makes me really want to see it someday.
---
I wouldn't mind if it's planned for the next expansion, and in the meantime we get some Charr/Norn stuff. Though my one fear is we get a lot of snow maps which I find to be depressing thematically when overdone. I am not a fan of snow zones in MMOs, though if there's one company to do it with some variety, it'd be ArenaNet.
---
its gotta be in your inventory and then you can spam it, faster spamming with the how to dance book
---
What is your biggest disappointment on the way lore has been handled?
---
I just wish they'd let Teq's Tendrils be conditioned. They're (un)living tissue, unlike most other condition-immune objects.
---
The furries are at Black Citadel in front of Serrated Blade.
---
Yup, I wasn't going to name and shame anyone but a certain Japanese MMORPG holds my personal title for worst customer support lol.
---
Stating PvE gets more resources and attention than PvP is definitely a conspiracy theory.
---
Very cute!
---
It is really fun joining a group of mob players killing mobs bosses/champions...
---

---
Sometimes I spent 15 mins to half hours to solo kill a boss/champion. Then meet mob players and kill the boss/champion in seconds.
---
&gt;thanks
---
Whereas in the UK we use *learnt* more often.
---
im really tempted to try ecto gamble but i know i have bad luck :&lt;
---
Right I don’t find ele hard to play at all but I see how someone who mains warrior or guardian would consider the change in gameplay hard, I’ve just mained ele for years so the rotations and cds are muscle memory at this point. I’d say on average though people just pick up the straightforward gameplay of professions like warrior faster and easier
---
I view it more as predator-prey relationship. We don't consider a lot of predatory behaviors such as spider traps, wolves who work together to split calves off from the herd, or dolphins who use clouds of dirt to funnel fish into a panic as evil. These are still smart and even tactical hunting methods, but they do it because that's how simply how they hunt.
---
Hell even us humans took wild cattle, spent generations domesticating them, and now raise them *explicitly* for food. To us that's just farming, but if the tables were turned and *we* were the ones being raised for sustenance then you end up with a Matrix situation. It's easy to assign evilness since the Tyrians are on the prey side of the relationship with the dragons, but just like any other predator they are only doing the best actions for them to eat.
---
What, our Ascalon?
---
if going to vendor doesnt bother you that much, might want to consider just buying a perma merchant contract. it's cheaper then doing gold to gem for 3 unbreakable tool + a merchant to sell trash
---
It is even more of an convenience thing if you intend to use glyphs.
---
We can have all of that. After Cantha.
---
I remember one of the interactions I had with Anet customer support when I deleted one of my characters that had my new golden piggy mini on it before I added it to my wardrobe. I was distraught because it was a gift so I sent in a ticket and I think the answer I got was something along the lines of “oh no not your golden piggy friend! I’ll get right on that!” It was short and sweet and I appreciated their willingness to play along with my sadness over my deleted golden piggy lol
---
If you haven't already, you can snag the engineer (and other!) [exclusive starting head gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Starting_equipment#Engineer) by creating a few temporary characters before you make your permanent character.
---
You guys run very well and bring a good fight. Always good to see the \[HERE\] Guild on the field. We know it's going to be a great fight!!
---
I'm really interested in that third black lion garden plot for my home instance...
---
dodge twice plus interrupt once plus health for two hits. So one needs to kill the boss in 5 or run.
---
They never could fly.
---
I would love to see these areas through Living World. I feel Cantha is worth a full expansion and subsequent Living World episodes.
---
Yeah it's like ANET was telling us this is not the world of tyria and even if it is you'll never see all of it.
---
Pretty much all the passes. The new WvW pass is often very populated with WvW players waiting to get in or duel friends and so on. Mistlock also very full. Well tbh most of them have lots of players hanging around.
---
They may make Cantha into another expansion (I hope) since this PoF we step foot in Elona.
---
Almost everyone has a second weapon set you can't see. So I don't see how it's really all that significant.
---
I may just know which game you're referencing. ;)
---
2019 fix.
---
And so have the dream of getting rich in GW2 ended for many. And theY stand with no gold and no ectos wondering what the hell happened there and how could i be so stupid :)
---
Canthaaaaaaa!!!! Ftw
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
I pledge myself to your teachings
---
I remember back when I played PvP for the first time before HoT, I did a weird combinations using the 1 through 0 keys for my abilities and also manually clicking on the icons with my mouse mid-combat.
---
Needless to say, me dying more often than I was killing people enticed me to give keybinding a shot.  If they arent feeling that incentive, I'd urge them to take the plunge and keybind anyway with the knowledge that they can reset to default key bindings again if need be.
---
I'm sure they'd have a better impression of it when they see what they can do after a week or so.
---
Hahaha, oh yes! Crochet is very easy to learn, I think. This pattern was fairly simple, I made it in just a few hours last night.   
---
I would suggest you check out the YouTube channel "The Crochet Crowd", I like his videos the best. And the best thing with videos is you can repeat parts as many times as you need!
---
Adding to the other replies, I also find them to give me an abundance vs scarcity feeling. Like, with normal tools, each use has a cost, while, with an unbreakable tool, it doesn't matter how much I use it (besides amortization which is never going to happen). So in characters that have unbreakable tools I tend to gather *a lot* more, because it's like "hey, I can mine this vein for free", "and this cassava roots as well!".
---
THIS one was considerably more difficult than the quaggan.
---
So it would seem
---
THERE IS NO WAR IN BA SING SE!
---
I can think of one instance, though it's a bit more subtle. Faren sails over and tries taking over the negotiations/attempts at connecting Kryta and Elona and whatnot, wanting to represent Elona instead of you know... Someone from Elona.
---
Did you save it? It's 404 now.
---
I quit playing gw2 the first couple years after release because they completely shit on the gw1 lore/ players.your comment makes no sense.
---
players don’t generally have 1 million hp though 🤔
---
Thank you so much.
---
Lmao.
---
Funnily enough this is accurate when talking about the occult
---
Tyria is the name of both the planet and the continent the game is set on
---
where is this from?
---
If you use a melee weapon to destroy it you will only need like 20 hits.
---
You *should* be sorry.
---
The wiki states the land was taken sometime *before* 100 BE, not that the ownership of said land started at 0 BE and lasted till 100BE.
---
According to [the timeline](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Timeline), the human gods (and humans) arrived at -780ish BE at the earliest, and history before that is very fuzzy due to -10k BE being one of the last known sightings of the Elder Dragons. But it's fairly easy to extrapolate that the charr existed for a bit longer than that, and held Ascalon for at least some of their history beyond the Bladeridge Mountains.
---
So while the humans of Ascalon have inhabited the area for at least a thousand years, the charr likely *did* own it for longer. To that end it's little wonder why the peace talks between the races started with less violence and more of an attempt of mutual understanding from the bloodshed.
---
So yes. *Our* Ascalon.
---
Tengu is like North-Korea, they probably claim to have nukes for the dragons n shit.
---
I don't see why they couldn't have it so when you enter WvW/PvP it disables the hide when stowed. Similar to like how your mount defaults back to Warclaw when you enter WvW, or how your builds are different depending on the gamemode you're in.
---
Its also where human life, the pantheon and by extension magic originated from.
---
Yeah, but I don't test how fast I can do 1mil damage, I test how fast I can kill them in the normal situations I get in WvW/PvP.
---
I really want Cantha, more than anything. But I would be happy going into the Charr Homelands and further north in the Shiverpeaks. 
---
But Cantha is way more appealing.
---
In my country only one store is actually selling the game. The other listed have not sold them since HoT came out and you can not order from them either. So even that is outdated. They should really clear those lists up and remove those that might be retailers but for sure not selling anything GW2 related.
---
I guess Twisted Castle is this Jumping Puzzle? First I am hearing of it. Is it new?
---
I'm not familiar with \[KING\], I have only really witnessed \[PINK\] out in the wild, really helpful with JP's (understatement).
---
I loved platform games growing up, but fast forward to GW2, and I'm suddenly turned off...? lol
---
Ehm anyway, grats to ya! Bet ya hearts were poundin', haha!
---
&gt; normal situations
---
either they one shot you, or you live long enough to see them blink away across the map
---
I got from 3k golds to not having enough currency to waypoint. Lol. So that helped me grounded to say stop every time I open the gizmo to sell my trash.  
---
But noicee. Congrats!
---
Why not buy a pre paid debit card and use it to buy gems
---
easy
---
&gt; go AFK
---
Any PvP match. ofc. best conversations, constant afk
---
Sounds like MMO's aren't your type of game then bud.
---
Hell yes
---
Lag doesn't make you go faster, it just desyncs you so you appear as teleporting forward instead of smooth walking. It can also make you not get hit by certain things since you dont move through them etc. But lag will never make you go "faster" - you'll go as fast as you see on your own screen.
---
It is not the real dT.
---
Unopopular opinion: I don't give a rat's ass what the Blood Legion homelands look like. Why does someone always try to imply that they would be amazing?
---
But I haven't logged in on a couple weeks. I got to level 80 and then work got crazy.
---
Taunt + Fear = Immob?
---
3.6 Elder Dragons. Not great, not terrible.
---
And in that very same instance, if you pick the right options at Gorrik’s trial, you will see some racism towards the asura from the Elonians.
---
IF we ever get behind those walls, it would be neat to find out that they had their own problems - like they were collectively cursed or frozen in time or had to flee to another dimenions, idgaf something like that.
---
I think you might have an appointment at Lake Yaogai.
---
that's what i did, bought a 25€prepaid card but now there is 5€ sitting inside that i'll probably never use. That's why i wanted to buy the 2k gems cards, it was supposed to be sold at 25 €
---
&gt;In addition, Jormag is the only dragon that has "supposedly" made a point of only corrupting the willing, although I think that only applies to the Svanir cult , as I can't imagine many Quaggan were voluntary converts (Maybe they are open to conversion during Quaggan rages?) 
---
I believe this is the case only with the Svanir cult. In Edge of Destiny we see Norn hunters who were turned against their will pretty early on. They went to slay The Dragonspawn but ended up as Icebrood attacking Hoelbrak.
---
Twisted Castle is a location in the 3rd raid wing Stronghold of the Faithful.

Holy shit

Their movement looked similar to extreme desync

it never ends

Gladly not the normal situation for me, hah. Usually it's the random Thief trying to ambush me in WvW, realizing he can't one-shot me, and that he's got three seconds to live if he doesn't have a condi clear available for use immediately.

Oh boy... seems like you misunderstand on purpose. I want something new for GW2. New lore! new areas that where not already in GW1. Everything they put in the game is new to everyone, doesn’t matter if the played GW1 or not. But if they are just visiting old GW 1 areas than it feels a bit boring to me.
---
If you do full power it will go to far. So just dont use full power and it will work fine.
---
Same, I have the same bag setup across all characters, all 20 slot bags, so I know where everything is, and the panel takes up less space by not showing the names of the bags.
---
Your character effectively cannot gain experience from enemies more than 10 levels above you, even if higher level friends help you kill them, because you need to do some damage yourself to get kill credit, but you will only get "glance, glance, glance" and 0 damage. Moreover, enemies will seek you out and 1-hit kill you.
---
[\[GW2Wiki\] Exploring high level areas](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Character#Exploring_high_level_areas)
---
The best you can do to gain experience in high level areas is from the exploration itself, and *sometimes* managing to get credit for events by inflicting control effects on enemies and/or healing/ressing allies, all while said enemies are sniping you at every available opportunity.
---
I leveled one of my characters exclusively by exploring high level areas for fun, without an escort. I'd already leveled 7 characters to 80 the normal way and I didn't look forward to doing the same thing an 8th time, but this challenge made things exciting again. It turned GW2 into a stealth game. I had to ration out my dodges, use every skill that granted invincibility, cripple or knockdown enemies for a few seconds, and strategically sacrifice my pet to get past enemies to unlock the next waypoint. After PoF came out and I got access to mounts, finishing his leveling became much easier.
---
makes sense, who would think of applying venom, bleed, torment or confusion to a pile of debris? :P
---
Wait, maybe fire could work, but you would need a very potent source of fire to melt the debris... something along the lines of the last dragon of Game of Thrones....
---
Better forget it, it's easier to pick a hammer and crack the debris into fine dust.... no need for a legendary hammer, a simple white pickaxe would work. :D
---
same. need 90 total slots for one of each race of each class of both genders..
---
The thing is, it's not fun or spectacular to watch bosses who take hours to die with rotations that run out and you end up with autoattacks. Even if I understand that it is painful to always see double chrono comp, it remains one of the only options to make fast and interesting records to watch thanks to the portal strats etc.  We would like to find a cool record to do with another class because we are a bit tired of the chronomancer and would appreciate some diversity :p
---
Some races can't choose to help some of the other lesser races for levels 40-50, like, I don't think charr can choose to help hylek, and I think asurans can't choose to help skritt.  So you may want to be wary of that if you play different races.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
To each their own.
---
Take a look!
---
The Jackpot was not enough for me, thankfully. Got the achievements/Merchs, then ran. 
---
Grats to you, hope you ran after! :D
---
you basically needed to be capped out on character slots before hot came out. most people didn't do that beforehand.
---
iirc you had to add the slots in a certain order, like cap out then buy a specific thing that came with a slot, then get HoT/PoF slots
---
I'm not sure. The way Anet was saying, it seemed like resetting some items was just a side effect of the new feature instead of a feature itself, so I don't think they were planning on resetting everything. Now, if there's enough push for it, they might try to reset things or have a way to change ascended trinkets' stats, either as a one time thing, or in a way similar to weapons and armor.
---
Actually either a previous version or one that was datamined showed they had expanded the map about 1/3 more than what is currently visible in game:

If you zoom all the way out you'll see plenty of obvious features not viewable on the in game world map.
---
Rata Sum, LA, and Divinity's always have people.  Basically anywhere that has a bank, TP, and crafting stations close to eachother.
---
Hmm, good point there. Didnt think of that
---
It would be great for them to have the default glider being them gliding with their arms.
---
So much more interesting than Cantha
---
Holy crap, what's wrong with you?
---
*Laughs in WvW.*
---
Cantha is like the brilliant car in the that mean where they guy is like “I like this, but this is brilliant” 
---
Give us Cantha already Anet
---
Unless it's a festival jumping puzzle.
---
Imagine a wall with retaliation
---
INB4 the flame legion says fuck it and tries to awaken Primordius.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if its holographic see-through mount skins.
---
As a new player who farmed cof for zerker exotic I can relate,can't tell you how many times I've lost the will to raid even after clearing the events.
---
Probably how non-Elder Dragon villains are treated.
---
How Lazarus is treated is definitely the worst offender there, but Gaheron, Kudu, Adelbern, Cadeyrn, Dhuum, Ulgoth, Taidha, and even Joko all suffer from the lack of screen time before their deaths despite interesting lore behind them (and half or more of the interesting lore is buried deep for most of them).
---
Balthazar's drastic and unexplained change in personality from a warrior of honor and defender of the innocent into a glorified manchild before he got stripped of power is just downright pathetic. They should have used Menzies instead, and could have used the exact same plot layout. Hell, I *still* see people posting theories that "maybe Balthazar was truly Menzies!" because of how Menzies-like Balthazar's GW2 actions were, but if it was revealed to be Menzies I'd bet no one would question it.
---
And Scarlet... well... Mary Sue villains are never fun. They had to retcon her lore three times before they finally settled it in a decent position, and that says a **lot**.
---
Am I the only one who thought this was a detailed RuneScape3 map at first

you can't really do this in wow and have it be reliable. A while a go you could, but the `/castsequence` macro command isn't really that helpful anymore. Macros in WoW are just there so you can make better use of your keys as there's a larger number of skills available (30+) which is much more than gw2 \~13 and also there's more direct target things. Many bosses have mechanics that place a curse/spell on a player and another play needs to remove it. Direct target cleanses aren't really a thing in gw2. Macros more let you handle situational stuff that you don't want a whole other button for. Marcos in WoW let you: 
---
* have a skill that's ground targeted be cast at the cursor or target with ctrl or alt modifer
---
   * ex: `/cast [mod:ctrl, @cursor] Death and Decay; [@player] Death and Decay` lets you cast a ground target aoe skill at your cursor when you hold down ctrl otherwise it casts it at your position 
---
* react to a situation without messing up your rotation and target. in GW2 you can't really spot rez in combat (yes i know there's a few skills that do this, but i don't know many builds that take them).
---
   * ex: `/cast [@mouseover,help][@target]Raise Ally` Lets you combat rez a team mate without needing you to drop your target/mess up your rotation
---
* use the same button for stripping a boon or clearing condition based on if your target is a enemy or friend  
---
* force stop a cast and cast something else (like an immune)
---
   * ex `/stopcasting  /cancelaura Ice Block  /cast Ice Block` 
---
* add rp to a skill (say something silly when rezing someone)
---
* cast things on a focus target. Focus targets are basically a secondary target that needs to have some cast interrupted on a rotation. So you can make a macro that casts the interrupt at your focus target while preserving your current target. 
---
* bind a command to a button that's buried in a menu. In Wow I could spec swap with one button that it would also swap all my gear, I know many people want that here.   
---
I'm not trying to call anyone out there just seems to be a misconception in this thread about how WoW macros actually work or how it can be a "one button game' while this was true for some classes/builds for some patches that by in large not the case anymore. 
---
WoW is definitely a game you can just play with by looking at the UI, for bosses you can have timers for each attack, warning and countdowns for each mechanic. Highlighting for people who need to be decursed/healed. All of those things are why I'm happy gw2 doesn't allow for massive UI changes because it forces you to look at the game and not bars on your screen. I think this is why OP's friending are having such a hard adjustment.
---
As a morbidly overweight individual I could certainly use less of it.
---
Defintely sounds like SE of Sandswept, where you grab a magnetized hammer and complete a reknown heart.
---
Yeah I'd really enjoy an expansion or some living world that's entirely focused on a baddie that isn't a dragon. I think it's much more compelling when the antagonist isn't some destructive, world - eating, one-sided dragon (ie Zhaitan). The stuff they did with Kralk in the end of Dragonfall was really cool and I wish they'd do more stuff like that.
---
But yeah I'm a fan of an enemy that could have been a normal person in another life.
---
You don't even have to complete all the zones revealed in there. The 100% is for core tyria. So no expansion or living world maps required. There's a list somewhere in the wiki if you wanna check it out onces you've played the game for a while and want to get a legendary weapon.
---
I spend my karma on Pact Supply, which is 31,500k, a day.
---
Look at all of those places, notice how there's next to no variety compared to Cantha?
---
Lets do that after we go to Cantha
---
It'll happen soon enough, DSD is very likely to play a part in it
---
Wait, does the missile act like a dismount as in you dismount as soon as you fire or do you dismount on successful hit?
---
I mean chrono comp is of course good and I used it myself in the cod p1 record I did a year ago , I still think anet should reduce the damage or boon output of power chrono to bring it more in line with other classes .
---
As I said I understand your class choice and I would have taken the same 
---
Nice record no matter what !
---
&gt;and skills do less damage to elementals of same element, more to the opposite,
---
There were things like this; such as how the Destroyers in some parts of core Tyria are immune to burning. I seem to remember that players complained about it, because not all classes have the elemental flexibility to change-up on-the-fly.
---
Pssh, look at this guy not engaging enemies by griffon dive-bombing from the sky!
---
Anyone have a mirror? They seem to have been removed.
---
... leave the pvp lobby, or change your pvp build.
---
Here is how separating them makes things easier for me:
---
In the top bag I keep all of the stuff I will carry around permanently: alternate weapons, musical instruments/toys, any Black lion consumables that I actually carry around (bank access, revive orbs, etc.) and things like eaters, portal scrolls, etc. (some of this stuff is in shared slots, but I only have 11 of them). Whenever I swap any of this stuff around, especially things like swapping from a two handed weapon to two one handed weapons and a slot opens up, having the separated bags helps me see where that stuff was supposed to go when it's time to put it back.
---
I then have an invisible bag where I store different consumables. The same thing applies: by keeping the bag separate, it lets me see where something was supposed to go if one of those slots gets emptied from use or for some other reason.
---
I then have a bag where I keep different stuff which fills up and doesn't easily leave the inventory, for example things like Auric dust and Dragonite Ore and Bloodstone dust and so forth which won't deposit because the bank is already full of it. By having it in a particular bag, it makes it easy for me to see where it is if I need to move it somewhere else, delete it, etc. I keep things like Winterberries here, too, so that when I want to make a big purchase with it and so I need to gather it from all my different characters that have been harvesting it I can look immediately and see where it is.
---
When I hide the bags this just looks like a jumbled mess to me and it becomes *significantly* less clear to me where I should be looking for a given kind of item.
---
Currently you can also get them for 25 black lion statues. If you buy keys or do key farm regularly you probably got enough statues to buy one. I feel currently the unbreakable tools are one of the best things you can buy for statues.
---
&gt; Unless the Khan-Ur was some poeto-mythic
---
Possibly. [Guild Wars 1 wiki](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr) says
---
&gt; The Charr are a savage fighting race that once dominated the eastern side of the Shiverpeak Mountains. They fought anything they could - including themselves. Eventually the many warbands of the Charr united under a single leader: the Khan-Ur.
---
&gt; In the days before the Gods of Tyria brought the Humans to Tyria, the Charr battled with the Forgotten in the Blazeridge Mountains. Long after the Forgotten stopped threatening the Charr, the Humans appeared and, with the help of their Gods, pushed the Charr from their southern borders, conquering the land that became known as Ascalon in 100 BE. Along with being pushed back, the Khan-Ur was assassinated, preventing any hope the Charr had to retake their lands. The death of the Khan-Ur caused a schism among his four children, who became known as imperators, and brought the establishment of the High Legions - the Ash Legion, the Blood Legion, the Flame Legion, and the Iron Legion. 
---
The charr existed before the Khan Ur. The Khan Ur was just a figure that united the charr and helped them move further...before being assassinated. And the human Gods helping the humans take Ascalon seems to be omitted from the GW2 wiki, as well. So that's fun.
---
It's less like you buying a house, and more like you going to a cat sanctuary and this all happens. *No shit the cats want it back*. Nevermind, being a sore a loser ever since the humans lost that god-assisting edge.
---
I still play GW2 and it will be my only MMO for a long time, I just do the rollerbeetle races since they were released last year and pretty much nothing else xD
---
when I play other games they are either singleplayer or sandbox multiplayer
---
Take a screenshot of your pvp build and your normal build pls
---
Now I want to see a 30 000 Health + 5000 Tougness + Retaliation aura wall.
---
Just signed up! Can't wait!
---
I mean it's true tho... An underwater expansion would suck ass! Anyone remember that underwater fractal boss? No! Because nobody enjoys underwater combat.
---
I agree, I think having characters with other motives than destruction of x is much more interesting for narrative such as Gw2. I personally found Scarlet, Balthazar and Joko a bit more interesting than any of the elder dragons. Especially now that they basically are 'forces of nature'. Grabs my attention a bit more having those variables on the field.
---
Wood can't melt. Otherwise it wouldn't be usable to make fire.  
---
Wood molecules are long and break at a lower temperature than they would melt.  
---
When the molecules break, some of the new molecules keep the fire going by releasing excess energy when binding with oxygen.
---
Added in expansion, but core tyria entities were never updated to remove condition immunity.
---
It is a leash range thing... the mobs in PoF/LS4 have some unique mechanics that no other mobs in the game have.  They a) Have an extra long agro radius, and b) have a very large patrol radius.  Both of these were implemented because the mounts move so fast that they are in and out of the agro radius of the normal game mobs before they have time to register your presence.  This is especially noticeable when you run through, say, Heart of Thorns maps with raptor and they don't even move in your direction when you go past.  By making the agro range and patrol zone extra large, it doesn't make mounting a get out of combat free button, necessarily, and still allows the game mechanics to attack you and potentially dismount you.  
---
The problem is the patrol path still keeps moving even if the mob itself does not because it is attacking you, or at least this is my suspicion.  So eventually that patrol path moves out of its leash range, and it de-agros and becomes invuln, starting to slither away to within range of its new "location".
