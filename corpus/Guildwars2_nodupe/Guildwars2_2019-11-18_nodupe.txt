Thank you, I hope that my comment made you exhale from your nose at some velocity.

The only things I find fun after 3 years of play are metas (specifically the HoT ones), fractals, and dungeons (they're still great). Raids are too hard and time consuming, and I'm terrible at competitive stuff. What rewards do I want? I want some of that cash store shit to be earn able in game through quests like the griffin collection. I want cool skins that are earnable.
---
Agree, it’s not a stream friendly game like the FPS games or wow
---
GW2 has many problems but them complaining about mega servers lying to them makes me question the sanity of these veterans.
---
I'm more intriguied about why is there a toy broom in your shared inventory? Since they made the whole shared account bound system for the novelties, why still keep it there..?
---
IIRC it happened in 2013.  I'll try to find an article aboot it!
---

---
Edit: I haven't found anything yet but I found this hilariously relevant post from 2014: http://dulfy.net/2014/06/05/gw2-developers-are-looking-into-build-templates/
---
Edit2: Sorry, I wasn't able to find the incident on their forums or elsewhere.  At the time (beta till 2015) I was in a guild which had a number of anet employees (qa mostly) in it, so I am wondering if I am remembering something they told the guild which wasn't public knowledge?  IIRC the incident was with an employee on the official forums talking to players in a very unprofessional way (ie. might've been akin to flaming).  What doesn't help is that several forum posts are no longer available (lead to 404 / not found when linking from google result).
---
Or, you know, the **Shiverpeak** mount set lol...
---
underwater mount which also can be used on land, because skins sell.
---
Meanwhile half naked humans are doing fine. Oh, I am ready for the reactions if mounts are not usable on the new map and there are enemies everywhere.
---
1. How's core Guardian for solo play? I seem to be finding that my survivability as Guardian so far is a bit polarizing, either I tank everything and kill everything instantly or I just get instagibbed (by enemies at the same level or lower than me).
---
2. Certain vistas are unaccessible without gliders/mounts/flying-things right?
---
3. Why does everyone look like the unloaded default model to me? I can't see the skins/outfits/custom models of anyone else, the most I can see is their attachments like wings
---
Did the same lol, i played the game as a f2p for 1 year and a half, and after i started doing Fracs, i saved all my encriptions (was going to open only with the mastery).
---
When i finaly bought HoT i had 5k saved, after training the mastery, i opened all of them and boom, insta 2k500 gold.
---
That i burned all of it in the march sale that happened 1 month later hehe.
---
There's [a lot of ways to profit from spirit shards](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards?filter.show_subcomponents=false), but whether or not you can survive the boredom is an entirely different matter.
---
I do have one more question. How good at support and/or healing is ranger on the way to level 80? I know Druids are pretty good at it once you get there, but I want to be able to do it on the way there as well.
---
I remember the gag order being talked about, which made it all the more frustrating that I couldn't find any news articles or reddit threads about it!  I am 99% sure it was anet/gw2 and not some other game/studio.  (I played GW2 from launch/beta/2012 till ~2015 religiously, so it would only make sense this is the game that the situation occurred in)
---
I am no longer in the guild I was in during GW2 launch.  They no longer play GW2 and I am not sure if they archived any of their gw2 discussions/forums.  I can reach out to someone in the guild (multi-game guild) to see if they remember or have any info if you are interested.
---
AFAI remember, the anet staff in question (I don't remember what department they were in) were discussing something like wvw or pvp on the official forums.  The discussion got heated and the staff resorted to using some poor choice of wording (I don't think it was directly swearing at someone, but hinting at something via indirect wording).  One or more users reported the post but the post was still visible for many days (I remember reading it and thinking it was poor wording but nothing majorly offensive).  The staff stopped posting shortly after and then all staff stopped posting a week or so later, with only the appropriate positions (ie. marketing) posting news.  I remember learning there was an employee gag order to halt all communication on the forums and in-game unless it was in their job description.
---
I thought it occurred after launch (ie. 2013), but maybe it was during beta?  I was in closed beta shortly before open beta.  I had to sign an NDA which included scanning some photo documentation and it was super cereal stuff.  So I am now wondering if maybe this occurred on the beta forums and that is why I can't find anything.  :(
---
2. But there's this one vista in Lion's Arch which is just on an island raised up high with nothing around it to get to it.
---
&gt;I watched whole Exilecon livestream and it was glorious. My favourite part was the Einhar intro, he did so good!
---
That's funny to me, because my friends hated it. It was clearly a bid for time, because Chris was almost in tears on stage.
---
I'm glad to see a dev that cares that much.
---
Yeah, I am personally reserving my judgment for the gameplay. The story I'll just watch on YouTube regardless of if I buy it - It's a non-factor.
---
Calling it a "dick move" this early though? Excessive and presumptuous.
---
*And it is nothing like D3's necromancer.*
---
ohhh ok tyty
---
Devs don't want passionate players, with ideas.  They want docile players, with open wallets.
---
Exacltly, thought this wasnt going to happen to me but left the game 2 weeks ago. No point in wasting my time in a soon-to-be dead game.
---
It would if characters actually played through the world changes individually, where you don't just all play on the same version of the map.
---
People shouldn't have to create a new character to "go back" and play different times, though, so maybe characters unlock freedom and people can play whatever versions of the world suit them after a point.
---
If they have the playerbase to support that (dividing characters/players up across the story periods), it might work.
---
Another way is to have the living story genuinely live, where the whole game world flows through its story on a schedule, then resets and starts over again after the end, maybe developing iterative additions to parts in the past as well as occasionally extending the world story into a further future.  Then the world changes have value and add ongoing interest watching them come and go.  Need some automatic catch-up/summary resources, so people who are away for a break or whatever can quickly re-place themselves in the current timeline, but with the world story repeating, work adding/improving such things keeps paying back with value and utility.
---
In my case, I am in three different guilds that have tons of people online playing but only 2-3 actually repping at a time. I've joined a few other guilds and it's the same story. Many online, no one repping. I feel like there are secret super active guilds everyone is committed to and I just keep getting into the side-pieces.
---
You have to scale appropriately.  In GW, "amazing" "story" translates to "dried and moderately less smelly" "excrement".
---
old LA best LA
---
Joko was great too. Until they killed him. I hate how even my own character acts like a PC cuck. I'd rather him/her just not talk. The writing is really cringe to me, I hate most of the characters in GW2 with exception of canach who is always a smartass.
---
I would agree with statement. Just because the hard core gamers you used to know are gone, doesn’t meant here aren’t new F2P people out there waiting to open up the world.
---
Luckily, the other possibility is that they disabled it only on the strike since its basically a 'mini raid'.
---
I have a Been There title. I still go back to Q-Dale and G Fields for events and dailies. 
---
I just tried the G Field beetle race time trial. Missed it by .40 sec
---
IGN and Eurogamer in 2013 and 2014.
---
I feel the same way man, I bought the game with the excitement that they would be updating the existing maps but ever since they 86'd that plan I just dont care what gw2 does any more. People complain theres no raids or fractals. I hate both and hate that they also abandoned dungeons in favour of fractals
---
LS1 had almost more cosmetic unlocks then the LS we get now. the existing maps changed. we got new enemies and an actual story line.
---
Just change the VA, they've done it before.
---
Good if they don't sell any boxes in Europe where it's legally obligated to reveal individual item drop rates from each type of loot crate
---
Crazy idea that definitely won't happen: what if they did a 3 month (or so) flashback event for LS1?  Restart at the beginning of LS1, each week a step forward.
---
The wiki page for canach has a good telling of his history in gw2, would recommend giving it a read.
---
Uhm... yea, that's exactly what I said was happening. Two games, same engine, tandem updates, sold separately.
---
[Anet](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/497/040/471.jpg)
---
Ugh, I know right
---
I suspect Chill spam so Lemongrass Poultry Soup. Not meta but anything to help get rid condi faster will help.
---
It is fine. People who finish with mount cannot be in combat mode to mount up. Meaning, they either just arrived to the fight or theyve been sitting on the side lines of the fight waiting for someone to go down. It is a fair trade off for someone to have a once-per-fight instant finisher if they were not able to contribute to the dps or cc that downed you in the first place.
---
2k500...why not just type 2500 then?
---
I honestly think mounts ruined maps. Made them feel too small and too easy to traverse and super scripted. But hey, they sell skins...
---
Gem Store for 600 Gems per preview.
---
I like the tactical advantage. Have some squad reserves hang back mounted until first downeds in backline then finish with no chance of rally.
---
[removed]
---
Nope. It's fine as-is.
---
The only friendly harpy in game is the one in Joko's harem.
---
Oh yeah? That's good to know.
---
You can do a little bit. They don't have weapons that are super aimed at it until you get staff with druid, but they have some skills.
---
Water Spirit is one (heal skill), search and rescue is a very strong res skill, and the elite spirit of nature is very supportive. Spirits in general are great support.
---
You might already know about this too, but any skill that is marked as a "blast finisher" on the tooltip will combo in a water field and heal surrounding allies. That healing scales with healing power you have on your character.
---
Warhorn's skill 5 is a blast and a party buff so that's a good one to use for it.
---
It will probably have non mount areas which I'm fine with. I love mounts but scary forest wouldn't work all that much with mounts.
---
Traversing maps by foot for the x-th time is so annoying.
---
I thought it had since all the shitty chinese gacha games I had on my phone one day all had to reveal rates or get removed from iTunes entirely due to non-compliance with the new law. Don't see why it would apply differently to PC games with loot rolls, same reason that Valve shows all the crate percentages on CSGO now.
---
There are no villages or groups if friendly harpies, but single npc's one of them in jokos harem.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but what exactly is the difference between a template and a loadout (serious question, I’m actually not sure)?
---
&gt; They initially state it was going to new content every month.
---
In the OPs linked picture it was originally planned to be 4 teams each spending a month working on content on a rolling release schedule of new content coming every 2 weeks. Look at Final Fantasy XIV if you want to see a well planned out release schedule with heaps of stuff constantly coming out.
---
Especially during Wintersday
---
I hope you know impersonation is against the code of conduct and you might be putting your account at risk for this
---
How in the world would you not know who leeroy jenkins is? Even if you never played WoW he has been referenced in everything.
---
She doesn't work for Arenanet anymore and you'd have to ban every single person who Fashionwar'd anyone.
---
Loot is so much better in GW1 because its much more sparse. It is just a clown fiesta in GW2. Its better to have no loot, than a bunch of trash to sift through. It was so bad that I used autoclicker early in the games life and didn't even care if I got banned, they design it to cause you carpal tunnel its not my fault just terrible design. Worst loot system ever.
---
A very friendly community!  
---
[So anyway, here's a screenshot of a recent pvp match I had.](https://i.imgur.com/mesz4hB.jpg)
---
wow, i can see your name and guild being forcibly renamed
---
a gem store only buff that you have to buy, last 2 hours, and only then can you use a mount for that 2 hours
---
Rather than be cycled back into the regular Black Lion Chests, most of those "exclusive" items have been cycled as options that you can buy with [Black Lion Statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette#vendor37).
---
For example, that Exclusives Chest lets you pick the Envoy Scythe Staff Skin or the Mini Spooky Mounts Pack -- both of those are available for Statuettes right this moment. The Statuette choices get updated at the same time that Black Lion Chests are updated.
---
Needs to be fatter and more female neckbeardly.

If you haven't already, check out this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dkl02z/d912pxy_dx12_for_gw2_now_v19/
---
That mod helps stabilize and in many cases significantly improves FPS.
---
The opposite, by far. We do actually get about two metas per day. Metas like Serpents Ire pre-nerf were literally once a week, when the largest guild in NA did them. If you wanna get any kind of meta achievements (Shatterer, Triple Wurm, etc.) you need to google the schedules of big guilds.
---
Bosses dropping rare weapons is for me an outdated way of progress. I prefer killing a boss to get an item for a collection. Rare drops are tied to RnG so it means killing the boss over and over until you get what you want. It is a lot more rewarding to salvage the material and craft my own stuff.
---
There's a lot of skills and traits that are useless, far more than any other class. I could understand if ANet wanted Thief to be a beginner-friendy, spammy, pure DPS class, but I for one would like more impactful decisions when traiting and playing GW2.
---
Try a client repair?

[The trailer endcap.](https://imgur.com/a/FaUsVs8)
---
Core: Literally anything
---
HoT: Get gold on Adventures. Make sure to "train" each new one.
---
PoF: In Thunderhead Peaks go down to the Ice Floes and follow the Volatile Magic from one end to the other. Do this on alts until it stops appearing. Repeat daily.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Two bots getting stuck against the ledge because they're not smart enough to jump while they're trying to get to their target. This happens very often when fighting bots and is an easy way to stall them for a couple of seconds.
---
They were removed from the game years ago, I've also removed them.
---
Again, thanks a lot for finding this 🙏

Why this is so funny to imagine

What are you even talkin about? Literally 0 leeching

---
Any idea how much gold 96 farm is?
---
&gt; The story is predictable AF
---
Well, occasionally they go too far in the other direction and throw some absolute nonsense out with no real foreshadowing (PLOT TWIST LAZARUS WAS ACTUALLY BALTHAZAR HUR HUR) in some attempt to "subvert expectations".
---
They tried no expansions, then they tried expansions, then they compared the results, and decided that no expansion was the way to go for 2019. You learn from the lessons of the past.
---
Firebrand rune in fracs is totally overkill as you get boonduration from AR anyway.
---
I'm not sure what the point the OP is driving at here. Yes, they need to produce content that keeps players coming back, but they already do that. Even if players take a break between releases (which some, but not all do), the important part is that they *do* come back, because they still find the game engaging. 
---
Expansions certainly don't improve on that, all that does is lead to the cycle of players coming in for the expansion, playing a couple months, and then leaving for a couple years until the next one.
---
A fair number of  bots playing on gold through platinum. Mostly if not always Necro.
---
What bugs me most, is not bots playing, it's when actual people are fighting bots off point for an entire match.
---
The necro bots are quite decent if they get into a fight.
---
Aren't kasmeeer and Marjory friendly in your missions or did they bug out?
---
WoodenPotatoes and Teapot?
---
I'm in a 500 people guild and we have \~10 people showing for guild missions.
---
You mean the WoW player who quit in BC? Why'd that qualifier suddenly go away in your example but it applied when you asked him for examples?
---
Somewhere between 30 and 65g per hour, depending on how good your group is and what tier of [Mist Attunement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account_Augmentation#Mist_Attunement) you have. 
---

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgWTvPhSlds for a DH vid of this, this doesn't show what the chrono would have to do for it though.
---
**Rewards:**  
---
Did you play Tibia? Everytime you kill something in GW2, it costs you NOTHING. You don't have to restore your health and energy with potions (worth some money). You have 100% chance to get profit. There are games with no guaranted profit or even loot.
---
Rewards here are meaningless because everyone is getting them, so it's common and cheap. Every new loot would be expensive at the begining, but it's value would go down it time.
---
**Fashion Wars:**  
---
You don't get skins, you get items and unlock their appearance, so you can just make your armor and weapons look like you want. I love it.
---
**Inventory:**  
---
Box inside box inside chest. It sucks, but it's still better to get Unid gear (which can stack and be sold) than regular item.
---
**Not friendly to beginners:**  
---
Sometimes it's nice if you can discover things by youself, but... as we know, people stopped thinking and usning their brains if they can't figure out what to do in events even if there's a description. I don't know about others, but everything was pretty clear to me.
---
**Poor PvP:**  
---
This is one of the reasons why I don't play PvP, because I don't like these games based on "DeFenD tHe pOiNt". I don't want to defend the point, I want to kill players and get points for it, not lose because someone stands on X point.
---
**Lack of famous players.**  
---
This is just my opinion, but I don't care about "Famous people". They're only players, doing the same thing. I don't care if there's someone from Discretize in my Frac party. I don't feel better. There are no reasons for me to make them famous.
---
**Garbage Marketing.**  
---
Maybe Anet doesn't care about marketing in some shitty country (like where I live). ANet employers probably don't know where is my country on EU map.
---
**Grind.**  
---
What grind? For Skyscale? Maybe.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would add one point:  
---
**Abandoned content.**  
---
Like dungeons.
---
I play DH myself 👍 need to find Group and Learn this today
---
They still plan to release PvP templates, which is best time to actually also update regular templates according to feedback....but one would imagine tht it takes some time...
---
I would personally rather wait for PvP templates release, that is ideal time to release update for regular templates. Balance update is just something totally different that it should not be mixed.
---
Was thinking the same thing. The title suggests constructive feedback, but there isn't a lot concrete here. Granted, a lot has already been said, over and over again, so repeating it feels useless given how much it has been apparently ignored.
---
in POF they were fine since the maps are massive but vanilla maps are just not designed for mounts. But yea having to constantly use movement skills to keep up with my mates who had passive buffs was annyoing as fuck.
---
You do realize this game has existed prior to the changes to signet of inspiration and curtain (whose swiftness buff didn't stack prior, and inspiration didn't have the guaranteed swiftness). I actually had to do world completion on the vanilla maps with mantra of recovery and centaur runes to keep swiftness uptime back then.
---
Well, the strike needed to have more than 2 min of content.
---
Several bots are high gold or low plat. That's better than the average gw2 player.
---
During off hours this rank is high enough to get match made even with top players because of how dead gw2 is.
---
I love how on the wiki picture that light and medium versions of the armour look quite nice.
---
Then the heavy looks like Walmart Megaman cosplay.
---
omegalul being this delusional about Pearl Abyss games. Not even BDO is p2w wtf are you talking about mate?
---
Go to the map 15 minutes before meta starts and use lfg to find a good map, any later and you might not be able to find one, they fill up fast
---
That's the reason why I made this post on the reply that talked doom and gloom, and not on the main post.
---
Look, I could've gone through my usual logical statements of saying that criticizing something and giving feedback does not automatically mean that they'll 100% take what you suggested in there and implement it tomorrow. That would be too impulsive, and can actually harm your product further. 
---
A great example of this when Aurorapeachy, the streamer,  at some point complaint about about how the sorting and send to collections in your inventory worked, as it was a bit annoying for specifically how she used it. A helpful dev implemented a change to make it work how Aurorapeachy wanted it to work, and a ton of people came in after the update complaining about it because, surprise, people use systems in different ways. And this is the reason why there are now is a very selective option in your right click menu of your inventory to enable or disable this behaviour, as that was the haphazard "fix of a fix" they implemented to calm people down again.
---
Anyhow, that's one potential explanation to why you don't see your feedback coming back in updates yet. Other explanations can range from the silent majority just not having a whole lot of issues with the current system, to people making outrageous suggestions that either take too much time/effort to implement to make it worth it, or things that would honestly be a step backwards architecturally, or silly things like that are never going to happen like removing the monetization part. Trust me guys, if they're really too highly priced that they aren't making money out of it, they'll change the gem price themselves soon enough.
---
I could've said all that, but I just felt like speaking my heart about this for a change instead, and you know? People in these kind of topics will downvote me anyway no matter how logical I bring my answers, so why bother?
---
With apologies to the late Terry Pratchett

---
I'd say only 2 people have strong recognition within the community as a whole. Dulfy because of her guides and previews, and WoodenPotatoes because of his analysis and commentary.  
---
I think what differentiates GW2 from a lot of other games, is that nobody has gained their recognition from playing the game.
---
What do you mean? If they announced an exciting next product people would actually be hyped as fuck.
---
The reason this game is a dumpsterfire is because there is no next release to care about.
---
Anyone in wvw have hope for alliances? Anyone in raids have hope for more raids or cms? Anyone in pvp have hope for better days? Anyone going to pretend collections are content that is enjoyed by the majority of players? Answering yes to any of these questions ranges you between delusionally optimistic and retarded.
---
If you look at the green box at the bottom of that wiki page, it shows that it was a Wintersday addition. So, yeah, it may come back next month again.
---
Danes if you do and damned if you don't. People love to complain and it gets them karma on this sub.
---
And most of it is gone without ability to replay it.
---
"Heavy is pretty princess!"
---
Honestly I can't really pinpoint the reason but I don't feel engaged with the story of GW2. Not since Tybalt. The lws really feels like an episode of a TV show. It's great for TV but this is a game. And try as I might I can't get into the lore.
---
I agree whales are the majority of the spending.
---
But this ignores that whales dont ever play in a vacuum. You need a broad and healthy playerbase and game to attract whales and keep them engaged as long as possible.
---
A game that isnt healthy or sustainable long term especially so.
---
I dont get it :(
---
The difference is rather irrelevant. Gw2 isnt dead, but it has some terminal illness. 
---
Everyone knows it's a matter of time. 
---
Its technically still alive, but not exactly living. Just making it through the day. Regular reminders of terminal illness whenever you step outside of the latest story map. 
---
End of life care is expensive. Please donate to our dying game.
---
Yup, and that what made it suck.I like being able to log in when a story is released and catch up a few times a year.  But to me LS1 was much closer to a "living" story and I felt much more immersed in the world than the standard story to meta map we have now.
---
Gw2 had more known players in the past. Because as you state, gw2 had more and healthier communities in the past.
---
But the veteran and hardcore community here is shunned and has only declined. Famous players with them. 
---
Casual players that dont interact with anyone (pressing 1 or F in the vicinity of other players isnt interaction btw) obviously dont care for famous players.
---
Can Kas speak in small caps now?
---
Golem week in wvw... Asuras racial elite was doing insane numbers. T3 doors stood no chance. Let alone people outside of golems, racial or not.
---
Blame the trashual community. They repeatedly demanded this even when rewards were rebalanced and nerfed.
---
Did it inevitably lead to farming the same metas until loot isnt worth anything and grinding for skins is most of their job? Yup. Did it decrease the value of everything except gems? Yup.
---
But who cares about effects in a month if you can demand a 40g/hour farm NOW.
---
Because people running around on low level maps arent relevant to them. 
---
If these players dont grow through to endgame they're literally irrelevant to the vets. If they dont join guilds, dont move on to endgame content, join or make lfgs, play with others then they dont affect other players. 
---
In fact you could replace them with bots and nobody would be able to tell the difference.
---
So new players that play for a week as pseudo single player... they dont make the game more alive unless you sit in starter maps drooling "ah, isnt it nice to see new players!"
---
And the game becomes more single player and bot focussed.
---
So the poorly thought out business model is the source of all their problems pretty much. That and lack of a game director with actual direction for the game.
---
The Titanic
---
no
---
Now, hear me out on this one...
---
Hydra Mesmers.
---
Oh Rose! Haven't heard that game in ages, she was my favourite character in that game :D!
---
&gt; Any good system that is functional and beneficial for players will do. But their system isnt :))
---
Now you see, this is the subjective part. Personally, I've used ArcDPS for my main and had about 5 builds on there. I was only really using 3 when the ingame templates came out, so it was pretty easy for me to convert that to the ingame variants, and after setting it up it's basically just as functional and beneficial to me now as arcDPS was...with the added benefit of not having this functionality broken on every major update of the game, and additional inventory space that got freed up with the equipment loadouts. So yes, the system is most definitely functional and beneficial to me. One friend of mine ingame similarly has the same kind of experiences, giving him the same quick access to swap his guardian between Power Dragonhunter and Heal Firebrand. Another friend of mine doesn't like it, she plays WvW alot next to PvE and can't get used to the game not automatically swapping to her WvW template when she goes there anymore.
---
Then there's people who didn't use build templates before, those more or less basically got more options than they were using for free so it obvious is beneficial for them, while the true power users of arcDPS with multiple classes in multiple game modes adding up to more than 6 builds per characters have to go back to having multiple characters to hold all of their builds, and it's not beneficial to them.
---
You see? This makes it complicated and subjective, but that does not automatically means it's completely not functional and beneficial, at all.
---
I'm also of the opinion the criticism before the release of the system was too hash, as well. I'm a big advocate of giving everything an honest try, and basically judging a change like this purely on speculation without having had hands-on experience is silly to me.
---
Thank fuck there's no shortage of sloots at least
---

some players understand this aspect wrong. What I mean is, they join  end game PVE and WvW with gear from core story. Some have rare-quality gear, no runes nor sigils and lvl 58 trinkets.
---
Lol yeah worked out great.
---
Could you elaborate on those signs?
---
I'm a veteran that quit the game but still occasionally browses the subreddit. 
---
The subreddit is in a very weird place right now... Seems that the game is glorified on some days, and trashed relentlessly on others. 
---
Anyway, I personally don't think the game is worth coming back to if you're looking for a game to truly invest a lot of time in. You'll be disappointed at the lack of new content entering the game, and disappointed at how horribly apathetic or toxic the community can be (a portion of the community can be very kind, but the majority of them is apathetic and/or toxic, don't be misguided by all the claims).
---
However, if you're looking for a chill, laid-back experience, the game might be perfect for you. It truly depends on what you're looking for.
---
Seems to be. I mean they're doing better today than they did the year HoT came out. *Way* better than any year GW1 was their primary game. We'll have to see how s5 does for them, but we don't have any particular reason to second guess them that this is not their best play available.
---
Depends on if you are upset about the build templates not being what you wanted them to be and/or if you are the small group of this game who want PvE raids that is much harder and more challanging then what they are today, then the sky is falling down. 
---
For the rest of the PvE players it seem to be working for them, the game is very active and have players for everything. But imo jump in and check it out. Be aware of if it was very long time ago since you played the game have changed a lot and end game have more to offer then it did the first years. Open world is a big thing and we get content updates about every 3-4 month and inbetween there is usually some events or festivals.
---
WvW and PvP is still active but don't get that much attention so they kind of are what they have been but you can still play those game modes and people do. In EU maybe more so but NA have activity enough too.
---
i think the current event cycle we have where
---
Event Start &gt; Runs for 10-20 Days &gt; Event Ends &gt; Wait roughly 1 month &gt; Next event starts &gt; repeat
---
it would be nice with some random pop-up events like LW season 1 had or living story stuff but we dont need more events that happen on a cycle.
---
Yeesh, I hope you’re never tasked with developing any kind of video game ever, let alone an MMO
---
we have one every 2 months now.
---
Yes. I mean if players are the type to gobble up content as fast as possible and then "finished!" and go away until more content is added, then better that they come back every few months than every year or two. 
---
For everyone else, that keeps playing throughout the development cycle, getting new content every few months is better than having to wait a year or more for anything new to drop.

If you wanted an Elemental Sword in GW1, you farmed Sulferous Wastes. Essentially you were farming a skin because stats wise, an Elemental Sword is the same as any other sword with the same attribute requirement.
---
GW2 goes one step further - weapons and armour are generic containers for stats and any skin can be transmuted onto them. 
---
In GW2 however, skin acquisition is heavily skewed towards the gemstore. There are no glider or mount skins that are obtainable directly through the game. They are all gemstore purchases and they are expensive. 2000 gem mount skins cost 25 euros. 
---
You can farm gold and convert to gems but this lead to a pve game state where it is not worth a player's time to target farm anything. You just liquidate everything you pick up into gold, convert to gems and buy the skins you want. Or you can just buy gems directly with US dollars because if you are talking about efficiency, working a full time job and buying gems with your disposable income is by far the most time efficient method of acquiring gemstore skins unless you own enough high value assets to generate gold at a faster rate via high volume speculative trading.
---
Its fine to have cash shop only stuff but to maintain player engagement, you can't make all of them cash shop only. You need to have things in the game that people want to keep, not think of solely in terms of its liquid gold value.
---
In GW2 you get loot bags within boxes within boxes that explode in a shower of crap. None of it is something you want to keep - its all crafting materials, vendor junk and intermediary collection items (which waste inventory space and have no value until you tick all the collection boxes).
---
I rarely get that jolt of excitement where something drops and I'm excited to find out what it is. Most of the time, its all just farming for gold and realising that you are not an oligarch and you don't have enough high value in-game assets to earn gold faster than you can just buy gems and convert to gold and that feels really unsatisfying to me.
---
Once you reach which end game? Raiding? The problem is people throw around the word end game as if my end game isn't end game for me, or it has no meaning. Are collections end game? I certainly thing so. They are to me.
---
What you're saying is if you're end game is raiding and t4 fractals, instanced content, which is what every other MMO offers as the defacto PvE end game. This game has a lot of options for people who don't want to do that.
---
All games are awesome timewasters. You think no one plays WoW is wasting time. Games are for enjoyment. If you're enjoying your end game, then that's great. I feel bad that some people aren't enjoying their end game. But that's not THE end game.
---
For me it feels like the the dragons are holding the lore hostage. 
---
Look at PoF. Anet did a great job setting up the continent. We have the free city of Amnoon, 3 nations of Elona under Joko who some see as a savior and some rebel against, we have the Order of Shadows splitting from the Order of Whispers with their own goals, Sunspears on the run trying to rebuild, the whole thing with the Djinn, and more. 
---
It's a very lore rich and complex region, a lot could've been done with it. Yet how much have we delved into this? We got introduced to them and then nothing. "Sorry guys, no time to focus on the lore, gotta kill another dragon.. again". And once the dragon's done, we peace out and never go back. 
---
The whole universe was rebuilt around the dragons for GW2. Everything took a backstage and every new development has to do with dragons in one way or another. They wasted the whole universe on lizards that got shoehorned in for the sequel.

Turn off show all XXX names.

A YouTuber I was watching explained **why** that’s boring in current MMOs and described various ways we could fix this, the bottom line of the message he was trying to get across is that people want (whether they know it or not) **meaningful work** with **meaningful rewards.** and this is one of the core concepts that will drive a person to continue to play an MMO
---
When all you’re doing is one shotting trash mobs and your level is practically nothing but a number, the story isn’t compelling, and rewards are basically trash that you could get by doing literally anything, **of course** the game is boring.
---
Look, I will admit that GW2 is a heavily flawed game, and it doesn’t implement this “meaningful work meaningful rewards” concept perfectly, but one thing it DOES do right, is that you’re given a leveling system called Mastery, you need to collect mastery points, and you need to gain experience in order to spend those points on skills. You’re given the **meaningful work**(I’m using this loosely right now because even I agree the grind can be monotonous at times) of completing metas for large chunks of experience, and the task of actually collecting the points, for the **meaningful reward** of being able to lean while gliding, or being able to jump really high on your springer, or being able to dive on your Griffon. 
---
**That** is the sort of thing that drives players to continue playing, they have a goal to work towards, they have meaningful work to do, they have a meaningful reward to look forward to. When they log on, they feel like they’re chipping away towards that goal. They’re less likely to take long hiatuses as they’re engaged in a struggle.
---
This is what made old MMOs so fucking good and addicting, you had so much meaningful work and each step along the way gave you something that **felt like progression** skill points for skill trees, piles of gold that were hard to get otherwise, rare pieces of armor with good stats that were really hard to come by and had super nice skins, etc.
---
Could things be better? They most definitely could.
---
Right now the state of MMOs in general is that we’re handed everything on a silver platter and it makes them really boring. 
---
The fact that WvW and raids are being kind of neglected reflects a desire to focus more on the community that would remain engaged between seasons. GW2 wants to be an MMORPG, so the devs are focusing on the part of the game that most embodies what an MMORPG is. Unfortunately for people interested in those modes, Anet has made it abundantly clear over the years that these modes are kind of vestigial, they’re not prone to growth, they’re in place as more of a bonus activity rather than a hard focus. There are plenty of games that focus on these things, Anet may have intended for these things to be a core focus, but they changed direction and they’re clearly not interested in pandering to PvP and raid crowds right now, which makes sense given how many games already offer strong versions of those game modes. Why would they bother to compete when they know a majority of their audience is more interested in open world content like metas? 
---
You guys have to think about this objectively. I understand what you **want** out of GW2 but what people say they want, isn’t always what’s best for a company or a game. Listening to the loud vocal minority of fans a little too much, has toppled many an MMO.
---
If I remember well if you preview the skin in the hero panel (so a skin you already have)  instead of right clicking for previewing you can see the equipped infusion, but I'm not sure
---
Any Negativity isnt allowed
---
Biggest female model possible
---
No offense but you quit the game, do you truly know what state it is in right now? Reddit posts arent even close to the reality of it. From wht I can tell it looks like everyone and their mom are raging about templates, yet ingame most people dont give 2 shits about it
---
Wait the game is going into maintenance mode?
---
Not yet
---
The problem is this game is very different from other games. You can think of hearts as quests, but they're not like quests in other games. You can think of DEs as quests and they're not like quests in other games. How many MMOs can you name that don't raise the level cap or add new tiers of gear with expansions? This game doesn't fit the mold, but people still try to judge it as if it's every other MMO.
---
If raids were the be all end game of this game, we wouldn't have waited 3.5 years to get the first one. In fact, plenty of people are saying raids are easy in this game, and thus not challenging content. 
---
Furthermore, what challenges one person doesn't challange others.  I feel like griffon races, some of them anyway, challenge me. And I can repeat them daily. Does that make them end game? 
---
In general for other games, you'd be right. Just like in other games, in general there's a gear treadmill that doesn't exist here. 
---
It's clear to me that there's a host of players who aren't raiding who are somehow finding end game here. If you're only talking to raiders that's fine. But I've introduced this game to a lot of people who raided in other games, who now get exactly what I'm saying. 
---
And sure, it may not be your cup of tea. But it's clearly more the focus of the company.
---
I mean, you're a griffon with earmuffs and a scarf on. So, yes, you are a joke to me.
---
I don't think this is a whine. I think this is meant to be funny.
---
The original post, yes, I agree. The replies on this thread? Absolute childish whine fest.
---
lol no
---
No it is not going in to maintenance mode. We have the saga that starts tomorrow and will likely go on for a year at least. We have no info what is comming after that which could be two reasons, one they want to see if the saga works better then expansions or if they need to go back to expansions or it could also be something else either maintainance work or other ways to deliver content.
---
Either way there was a porlouge that was as large as the previous living stories have been, and that give us a pointer toward more content involved in the saga. We will see how that turns out. 
---
So no it is not going in to maintenance mode and wont in a long while.
---
&gt; Even if the game is going into maintanance mode next year
---
bs
---
Downvoted because you could just take a break instead of whining about the perfect game that gw2 is. 
---
/s
---
Grind for new players is a problem.  You finish the core story and end up with rares/greens/blues for gear.  You're level 80 but your damage and such is nothing. Which means taking a lot of time leveling up a crafter.  In the beginning of the game I'm sure that gave people something to do.  Now it's a time-waster.  If you use the level 80 boost you're "golden" to a degree.  You at least have exotics but the exotics that are given out often have stats that don't work in PVE, still better than than the yellows/blues/greens but not always helpful depending on the content you're planning to play.
---
Time-gated mats make x-material 1 per day is the Ascended situation.  If you're starting to play that means it can take weeks for you to finish your first ascended piece.  That made sense when it was first introduced, not so much now.  It is grindy to get the mats needed to make gear.  No way around it.
---
I can't even help my friends who just recently started playing.  Once they get to a certain level I can't really do anything except face tank/heal etc.   The level 80 zones are too much for their level 80 toon in "core" gear.  They've not played enough to get the mats to level their crafters up and it's discouraging for them to die so much.   Some zones they get 1 shot by trash mobs.
---
"Low visibility. Can't mount bro."
---
Its a good time to download another game instead
---
Some nice armors/weapons to craft. Aurora/Vision as well.
---
Yes, that's why I used "if", not "when". I used extreme scenario to explain to OP he is safe to invest time in the game, because he already has a lot of content to go through.
---
if and is means you think it will.. 
---
maybe correct your mistake and put if and was instead?
---
I kinda wish they'd let us design the home instance and place the nodes where we want them... Right now, it's way too spread out.
---
I wish more people tagged and went away to leech. Judging by arcdps, most players' dps is abysmal and barely makes up for the upscaling they're causing.
---
agree LW1 was a big mistake, that looked good on paper and even maybe worked fine then. But now is the source of problems for new players that is hurting the game more then people who played it think. The big hole in story makes new players dont care about it, about characters. Because of it they unlike us veterans dont care about what will happen next with Taimi or Kasmeer. What I want to say is that we may think LW1 was amazing but it actually failed and may be one of the reason game have a hard time right now.
---
It's a debuff with roleplay, just like the Knife Tail Hunting Gang is a lootbox with roleplay.
---
I quit after episode 6 of season 4, and played the story of the prologue. Unless I'm missing a huge content release, I'm pretty sure I'm very well aware of how the game is doing right now. 
---
And from what I can tell from templates, they seem like they do the job just fine, so that's just another example of how fucked reddit is. 🙃
---
This. There is no way to beat supply and demand unless you account bind stuff.
---
GW2 is very rewarding in the way that pretty much every type of content drops the same junk and that junk is salvageable for materials which are typically high demand. I personally am a fan of this because it means I don't have to play any specific type of content to keep earning gold at a reasonable level.
---
I just got the jackal mount, it feels suuuuuper clunky. What are it's benefits over the raptor mount? When do you prefer jackal? Other than the sand portals obviously.
---
When this game launched the devs actually said that the temples in Orr were end game. They used them as an example of end game. That was the design of the game.  They did mention dungeons, but I don't recall them mentioning dungeons as end game, even though they said they were difficult content. But they did talk about Orr as end game. That's how they designed the game.
---
Generally speaking just because one demographic likes something better, doesn't mean it's better either. I am relatively sure more players find open world meta events better than raids, on the whole. That is less people raid or are interested in raiding. You can say it's because they suck. You can say it's because they're addicted. I've heard both comments recently. But your interests are yours....other people have different interests. Raids aren't better for me and people like me. Nor is instanced content. I'm here for the open world and I assure you I'm not alone.
---
The code of conduct doesn't only include anet members, lol. 
---
Also the name of your char *and* your guild could be abused to pretend you are from Anet.
---
You need to think about your positions more. Youre trying to argue more maps is better to not split the playerbase. And as for my "anecdotal" evidence, its not anecdotal. I used to be a lead commander in guild wars 2 community, the biggest eu community that existed. My friends list is full of ex commanders, im part of 3 of their guilds full of people, and I got added daily by 20 people looking to run triple trouble. None of these people are still playing. I dont know how much of a reference base you need, but literally thousands of dedicated players is a good start.
---
"If you combine all the total revenues of ALL GW1 launch windows, they would not add up to the GW2 launch window, and many of those GW1 boxes were bought by the same players buying all the expansions. "
---
Guild wars 2 has an average of 1.5 million players. Guild wars 1 had that at its peak easily. It sold 1 million in its first year alone. Numbers dont support you.
---
You really think ff14 keeps its players because theyre a different audience? How do you explain ff11 a similar game being killed because of its unpopular state. No, this is not opinion. FF14 keeps its players because it can keep content coming at a reasonable rate. They do this by utilizing old assets intelligently. You can find this out with a basic level of research, go ahead.
---
Last thing MAPS DO NOT EQUAL CONTENT. Maps by themselves are not content. They are a playground where the actual content is. If you throw in the same events in 2 maps, one old, one new, you have the same level of content. Your statement "they have much less content, therefore they have more content" is disingenuous at best, because what my point actually is : They use their assets smartly to make new content without needing a new playground. They can pump out 5x the content because they dont need to make a new map every time they want to do something new.
---
Thanks for this, now if there were only players to help. :&gt;
---
sorry, fat fingers, it should have been 2 not 3. Skyscale wasnt the only mount we got this year we also got the warclaw in march.
---
You're servery underestimating the work that goes into things I feel. do you really believe all Anet has to do to make a legendary accessory is design the effect and thats it? Dont you think you're ignoring a lot of the work that goes behind the scenes, the design of the collections needed to get some of the ingredients necessary, the work that is required to implementing that collections, creating the story that accompanies it and then translating all that in game objectives and finally writing the hints that guide the players to those objectives? thats not counting the testing either.
---
same thing for weapon sets, its not just the model of the weapon itself, to craft the heroic versions you have achievements you need to do that and those too had to be designed and implemented. 
---
\&gt; the strike mission is literally a story boss but more HP. 
---
The fight itself sure, but what about the supporting features?, The ability to choose a premade squad or public when entering the instance,  the instance itself , the jumping puzzle in it, the system that allows any number of players to start the encounter when ready. The rolling snow ball,  the story / dialog, the voice overs, the reward delivery, the ice slipping mechanic, the teleportation mechanic once someone gets to the arena. A lot more work went into strike mission than just getting the story boss and adding a bit more health to it!  
---
\&gt; I mean making a race is barely any work 
---
are you sure about that? Do you really think Anet making a race is the same as someone putting a race together in a guild hall? Like lets take the Volatile Delivery race in Thunderhead keep. First of all someone had to design that, its not just designing the track the race is going to take place in but also the mechanics that go with it because anet tend to always want to do that little bit more with anythign they do. What they came up with is not only you get the usual race time but you also have intermediary timers in between checkpoints. They gave that a story dimension so it feels less artificial. They also designed it so it requires multiple mounts and that obviously requires strategic placements of the checkpoints. All that needed to go in tandem with the map design so it likely involved multiple people. If you dont make it to the checkpoint in time you loose the whole race. 
---
Now design is one thing but you also need to implement. The intermediary timers discussed above need to be implemented as well as a way to represent them in game, someone had to develop that and hook it up with the existent racing infrastructure, make it trigger an explosion and have you fail the race if it expires.  They also had to implement the timer resetting if you make it to the check point. The map has to be updated when the race is triggered to show the various checkpoints. You're also supposed to be carrying a volatile package so someone had to model that and program the race to change your back item to the new pack to represent that in game and add that little more realism to the whole thing. Yeah dont think Barely any work is accurate. And yeah we got only 5, together with EVERYTHING ELSE!
---
\&gt; What are those 15 story line missions? 
---
each episode story is made of 5 separate missions on average.
---
\&gt;  All together it's 6-7hrs of pure story which isn't that much. 
---
If you skip all the story elements and just rush through the actual objectives, sure maybe. but If you actually follow the story and talk to the npcs it takes closer to 6hrs per episode not in total. 
---
\&gt; OMG YOU DID THIS STORY STEP? HERE GET THIS CHIEVO. and you get like 10 of those each episode :) 
---
what? first of all thats always been there but thats just 1 achievement per story mission and like i said above there is on average 5 story missions per episode hence only 5 achievements you get for completing the missions themselves per episode on average and btw they're just for fun, they give no achievement points at all. So If we take War eternal there is 238 achievement points to be had, 0 of which are gathered for just completing the story. 
---
\&gt; we didnt get legendary sigils, just runes. And like ascended cooking it was rushed and on top of that incredible overpriced. idk why anet thought with current market prices 400g/rune would be worth it. Should've been 60-100g/rune. 
---
We got both actually. We're not discussing how amazing each feature is and how well thought out, completely agree with you the prices for crafting legendary runes/sigils is absurd. That doesnt negate the fact anet had to invest developer time to make it happen which is what we're discussing here.
---
 \&gt; For 250people it is kinda low. Especially compared to FF14 which also has a dev team of 260-280people, with the 5.1 patch we got more content in FF14 than half a year gives us in GW2. On top of them actively improving their older content to make it more enjoyable for newer players.
---
How so? I dont play FFXIV so its hard for me to compare the two but I've tried seeing a bunch of lets play/reviews on youtube and read patch notes to try to compare the two and I dont see this truckload of content that supposed to drown not 1 but 2 gw2 living world releases. Seems to me the two are actually quite on par. Story content in 5. 1 seems to have included about 4 - 5hours and that including a dungeon run (based on actual lets plays that went through the story). There was a raid but no new map. a new game+ which from what I understood it allows you to play past story missions for no rewards, well gw2 can do that too.  Some new furnishings for houses, some side quests (dont really know how many cant comment) 3 custom deliveries, 5x beast tribe quests. some balancing changes. scenario mode added to trust system, dont know what this is, but from the description it seems like redoing old content with new characters or something of the sort.
---
Seems pretty on par to me with dungeon + raid on one side instead of a new map which I'd say take similar amount of work to make. Now I get it if you're one who loves doing dungeon / raids one game will give you many more hours of enjoyment then the other but keep in mind the opposite is also true, as someone who loves open world exploration a lot more then repeating dungeon / raids having a new map to explore gives me hours of enjoyment too. 
---
\&gt; Anet is known for their incredible bad workflow, you can't really deny it. 
---
no one outside the company has any visibility on their workflows how can it be general knowledge?
---
\&gt; This was literally the reason why they had the layoffs 
---
The reason given for the layoffs was ncsoft cancelling their side projects. That has nothing to do with the performance of Gw2 or Anet in general. Square Enix cancelled projects as well doesnt mean FFXIV team is has bad workflows! 
---
Again tons of assumptions, we dont have a clue what the side projects were much less why they were cancelled. Not all projects are cancelled because they're bad and not all bad games are cancelled. FFXIV wouldnt exist if that were the case dont you think? And plenty of example of promising games that got cancelled for the craziest of reasons like The latest Silent hill because Konami had issues with Kojima. Or the highly anticipated prey 2 which was cancelled because allegedly it didnt meet Bethesda's standard even though every game play video shown showed a game that was light years ahead of anything else available at the time!
---
I miss when they had huge living world updates every 2 weeks. No other MMO ever competed at offering updates that large on such a frequent basis. I worry GW2 will never return to those glory days as its an aging game.
---
The other sad truth is that PC MMORPGs are a dying brand. They're very expensive to make/risky and not as profitable, so companies would rather make the current fad(battle royale/autobattler) because it will sell more, or mobile games.
---
Yeah, because once I was once as delusional as you seem. 
---
No offense intended, it was actually a big problem for me. I was in denial of doing anything wrong because I didn't accept that other persons point of view were correct or that mine could be wrong. One year of therapy and some fights with friends made me finally realize that sometimes the rest of the world sees something that I don't, and I better pay attention to what it's or I'll be in trouble.
---
It may happen to you, so we're just trying to help you realize.
---
I think you were hacked also
---
This is assuming all the mMsteries of Raptor + Jackal are unlocked, otherwise you would have to add that before Jackal Mastery 3 it's the only mount that can dodge attacks during their jump/teleport animation.
---
Base speed (ie. without using the jump/ability) of Jackal is higher than the Raptor.
---
Raptor is super bad at jumping uphill while Jackal teleports follow the slope and don't get stuck on it. Raptor is however very good when going on flat ground or when when going downhill (you get more out of the Raptor jump then). This is my main reason for using Jackal as my default mount because the group is very often and for some reason I often end-up having to go up-hill.
---
Jackal is nice if you sometimes plan to throw yourself over high cliffs this a Jackal port resets your height and thus prevents you from taking (too much) fall damage.
---
Similarly because you can use the teleport mid-air on the Jackal it means you can sometimes get further that with a Raptor (assumin you don't have some other mount more suited for air travel since you just unlocked Jackal) and if later you couple that with the [Bond Of Vigor Mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bond_of_Vigor) you can dash while falling for qui some time (assuming you start from high enough ofc :p).
---
I fell that the shorter evade frame on Jackal can be more interesting sometimes when the path is not really straight or when you have a bunch of hostile mobs and traps all over the place and you don't want to risk landing on one (looking at you Desolation and Vabbi). For longer travel on rather flat ground Raptor will be faster than Jackal (and you can be even faster with the Beetle mount from somewhere in Season 4).
---
For engage sometimes Jackal is useful to get a bit of initial barrier when you are jumping in the middle of "a few" mobs: if you are solo Raptor would win but if you are 2+ one Jackal is nice to get the bast of both worlds.
---
Development takes time and planning WTF is wrong with everyone on reddit why you so entitled?
---
Polla buged out the same way, since she didnt had any restriction at release. Lowlevel players were able to oneshot ppl or small groups.
---
Yeah but they need to split these up more Dragon Bash should be June and Four Winds should be in August. Last year it was Dragon Bash in June and Four winds in July which was okay because Dragon Bash was essentially new but they can't do that every year.
---
Right? Imagine thinking Living World for four years with only super-easy strike missions is more sustainable than having an expansion with new fractals and raids to look forward to.
---
If you are going to come back from work and get on the content right away I would suggest ensuring that the character you're going to do the story with the 1st time is "ready" the day before (it's like 5-10 min):
---
 
---
* you are on a gear+build you can play well/enjoy playing
---
* your inventory is as clean/empty as it can be without throwing half your gear in the bank either (to avoid having to stop every 5 minutes to empty it)
---
* same idea but refining base materials that are close-ish to being full in your material storage can be nice and help you not have to worry about capping
---
* maybe place your character in a not-too-crowded area for faster initial load
---
* (ultra optional) maybe get a bit of cheap food with you in case the extra safety can be nice like some [lifesteal food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scoop_of_Mintberry_Swirl_Ice_Cream) or some [health regen food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tropical_Peppermint_Cake) or even a more XP/MF oriented food
---
Jeez no we need less😁
---
No because people will get bored of it yeah you may say "oh no I won't I love SAB" but I know this community if SAB is activated permanently people will stop playing where as if Anet do it annually they can be confident people are going to play it.
---
I remember some in Blazeridge Steppes

You cant buy expacs that way. You can buy living world seasons that you missed, which are basicaly episodic expacs, and it takes quite a while, and you cant play 3rd,4th, and 5th season without expansions, only 2nd.
---
&gt;You need to think about your positions more. Youre trying to argue more maps is better to not split the playerbase. 
---
I'm arguing that more maps are *necessary,* because explorers require more maps.
---
Then, once that has been understood, I am saying that "adding new bosses to *new* maps is better than having multiple iterations of old maps," because adding them to new maps provides additional reasons to be there, whereas adding them to old maps, people would only come *because* of that revamped boss, and be bored by everything *else* happening on that map. 
---
&gt;And as for my "anecdotal" evidence, its not anecdotal. I used to be a lead commander in guild wars 2 community, the biggest eu community that existed. My friends list is full of ex commanders, im part of 3 of their guilds full of people, and I got added daily by 20 people looking to run triple trouble. None of these people are still playing. 
---
I'm not sure you understand what "anecdotal" means. 
---
&gt;I dont know how much of a reference base you need, but literally thousands of dedicated players is a good start.
---
Not particularly, in a game of hundreds of thousands. You've never even played alongside most of the players in the game, even in a zerg.
---
&gt;Guild wars 2 has an average of 1.5 million players. Guild wars 1 had that at its peak easily. It sold 1 million in its first year alone. Numbers dont support you.
---
Here's ANet's [revenues since 2005.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7bzor8/arenanet_a_complete_history_of_earnings_since_2005/)
---
Adding up every unit sold between launch and the first expansion, they only sold $46m. The first quarter of GW2 sold $40, and the second $110m. It takes up through about Eye of the North for QW1 to match the first two quarters of GW2, and it trailed off precipitously after that. And keep in mind, their "units sold" were not individual players, because many of the people who bought Eye of the North had also bought each of the other four expansions, so they are shared in terms of playercount, not additive. 
---
And of course GW2 continues to add new players on top of that, with many that started well after launch.
---
&gt;You really think ff14 keeps its players because theyre a different audience? How do you explain ff11 a similar game being killed because of its unpopular state. 
---
FF11 launched in 2002 on old hardware. It's a miracle it stayed alive as long as it did, especially after their successor came out.
---
&gt; FF14 keeps its players because it can keep content coming at a reasonable rate. They do this by utilizing old assets intelligently. You can find this out with a basic level of research, go ahead.
---
FF14 would not exist if not for the "FF" part at the beginning. 
---
&gt;Last thing MAPS DO NOT EQUAL CONTENT. Maps by themselves are not content. They are a playground where the actual content is.
---
They are *part* of the content. An empty map is boring. Plain events and bosses just dumped in an empty plane is also boring. Some players enjoy PvP or boss battles. Others enjoy exploring. You need to create new environments for people who enjoy exploring to explore. 
---
&gt;If you throw in the same events in 2 maps, one old, one new, you have the same level of content. 
---
No, you'd have less, because you wouldn't have any exploration content. It's be like saying that if you threw noodles, chicken, and stock into a bowl, or noodles and chicken into a bowl, either would be just as much "chicken soup."
---
&gt;Your statement "they have much less content, therefore they have more content" is disingenuous at best, because what my point actually is : They use their assets smartly to make new content without needing a new playground. 
---
If they're reusing maps, then they have less to explore, therefore they have less than if they had new maps.
---
&gt;They can pump out 5x the content because they dont need to make a new map every time they want to do something new.
---
I don't know about that. Typically that's not how work is divided. Environment teams tend to be completely different people than the ones designing boss encounters or even event mechanics. I mean watch the Guildchat about the Grothmar Valley, they had on one person who did all or at least a lot of the "map" itself, and then completely different people who were placing events on that map. Now you might argue that they could take that map person and have her designing missions instead, but that's not her skillset. You could argue that they should fire her and replace her with another person designing missions, and maybe *you* would be happy with that, but plenty of other players would get burnt out playing on the same maps they always have, and move to a game with fresh vistas.
---
Probably would do you well to ask this tomorrow when the new patch drops.
---
at least that last gardening plot was free. I always expected that anet would just ask for gems to get it.
---
In any case, the home instance cooking station doesn't bring anything new since you have those with every "XXXX pass" they release.
---
"Pvp lobbies are crowded"
---
Clueless Anet whiteknight spotted, time to nope out!
---
The top and spread of a mmr system depends on its amount of players. Pvp ladder going down in rating over time proves a steady loss of players. 
---
As far as anet is concerned, revenue is down and so is the size of their studio.
---
You demand numbers for my claims but provide none for your own. Believe as you wish, have fun with the crowded pvp lobbies lul.
---
So the most reasonable option is to buy latest xpac and i have everything right ?
---
And yet sub fees are sooooo evil....
---
It's probably because of two possible reasons:
---
* Mount skins are not the canon mounts used by the commander.
---
* Black Lion mount skins are actually illusions applied over the canon mount, which are the normal Elonian mounts, and do not actually change the mount.
---
Holy Mother of God.
---
Any direct link with 2019-worth resolution?
---
No there are no plan to refresh the personal story, especially not the story part. This would be to much work for the little gain it would bring.
---
GW2 started out as lets do a few things in distinctive ways, but over the years has morphed into lets have a bit of every MMO meme/feature every other MMO has.  For me the single player RPG element - the Living Story - has never been a drawing card.  I have plenty of single player RPG's that do that way better.  
---
As long as GW2 keeps trying to be everything to everyone, it will remain the mush it now is.  
---
It's done, there is no going back to the original core ideas and simplicity.  Too bad, it had great promise, another MMO ruined by mis-management.
---
Gemstore skins and outfits are more and more ridiculous/overdone.
---
I understand they have to drift further away from normal GW2 aesthetics with each release, so the store additions remain impactful and people fall for it.
---
And it's obviously generating income, but the game now feels more like a disco party or eccentric fashion show than a serious mmorpg.
---
And I'll say this at the risk of being mocked or meme'd, it hurts my immersion and prevents me from caring about lore and story.
---
It's hilarious because that's exactly what I thought.
---
Monstrosities, undead abominations, horrifying crystal constructs in an unholy effigy of life, - HAVE FUN, KIDS!
---
I'll ignore your soy-infused passive aggressiveness and piss poor attempt to insult and indulge this:
---
1. Why is my cosplay any different than other people's cosplay that actually are after real people?
---
Since you are the accuser you need to provide evidence that EVERY cosplay depicting a "RL" person has been subject to the punishment you are proposing. 
---
I await your reply
---
Thanks
---
The only thing that I recall that rings a bell in regards to a dev being gag-ordered after interacting with the community, would be Josh Foreman's interactions during the SAB 2 release. Since it was his baby, he was very present on the forums, and he didn't speak with the typical bullcrap PR responses. He was very real, and it was really clear that he cared for what he created a whole lot, and there was a **very** negative contingent of players that bullied him a lot until the PR dept stepped in and gagged him; partly for his own good, partly to quiet a vocal and shitty part of the playerbase. 
---
I don't know if that is what you're referring to, or even if I have all those facts correct, but that is my recollection.
---
Welp, there goes 2000 gems from my account.
---
Ah to clarify. I mean having chilis to warm the body in the Far Shiverpeaks. A non addictive alternative to the one from Bitterfrost.
---
It pervasive throughout everything now.
---
Look up my thread on my 1st Cosplay......lol
---
I'm still waiting for the charr bike beetle skin!!
---
I wish skyscales didn't make springers obsolete outside of perfectly placed cliff patterns and choya pinatas, giant rabbits &gt; dragons imo
---
Servers been trash for years now, next
---
Not that much of a stretch.  Back in the day, Hydras were Elementalists...
---
That has been debunked.
---
There's way more skins earnable in-game.
---
They look worse in general to most people, but there's more in-game ones that gemstore.
---
This is perfect for people like you: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/
---
Those are hostile, harassing friendly ogres and keeping them from using a local watering hole.
---
Those things should be added to guilds, honestly.
---
Those 2 do feel very similar indeed, especially outside of PoF, fortunately the others have a more unique feel and use imo.
---
&gt; superficial release of that episode thingy most players don't care.
---
Now you're just being salty.
---
I guess that's a whoooosh.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Book_Of_Knowledge:_Harpies
---
Little is known about harpies. And we can't be sure about we know about them.
---
When it comes to isolationist xenophobic races, harpies are only second to krait.
---
I would recommend you create your account and log into the game before tomorrow end of afternoon (EU time) that way you can still unlock the current Living Story episode for free even on a F2P account (you won't be able to play without xpac but the episode will still be unlocked for your account when you get the xpac).
---
I hope they will continue it eventually!
---
Looks like a good necromancer skin.
---
&gt; are there any plans to refresh personal story?
---
Not a chance. There's an entire chapter missing at the end of the personal story that they've never put back in.
---
Stop, please. It hurts.
---
The only way I would come back to gw2, as far as I can see, is if they added a well designed personal housing system that adds tangible progression back into the game.
---
I luv this.
---
Wow, I absolutely disagree with you for so many reasons! The idea you just explained would mean that all MMOs should have a steadily declining player base- anyone who stops playing for any amount of time will get left behind and should, as you said, “focus on single player games”.
---
A good MMO encourages players to stay active in multiple parts of the game so at any given time a new player can join the game and find players and content at any stage. 
---
New players trying to get the Griffon, Roller Beetle, or Skyscale should be able to do so. The reality, however, is that you get stuck with posting things in LFG for hours at a time hoping someone will have mercy on you to help kill that world boss, that specific legendary, or do that meta event with you. If your time is limited, you’re more or less screwed.
---
Moreover, I personally hate gemstore cosmetics and knowing that so much development time is being poured into the gemstore really sucks.. 
---
Because that time/money could be put toward developing new JPs, Fractals, Raids, elite specs, WvW/PvP maps and ideas, story arcs, and *gasp* **in-game rewards**...
---
I hate how GW2 has evolved. Completely killed my joy and love for the game.. I headed back to GW1 recently, and it has made all the difference. 
---
Such a better game, imo.
---
GW2 in my opinion is the jack-of-all-trades game that has everything but is not good at anything.
---
Yeah because the same person developing a springer skin is the same one developing fractals...
---
And the cool characters and villains get totally overshadowed by the dragons while we simultaneously have made the dragons less and less of a real threat. 
---
Palawa Joko was a great villain- cool backstory, great lore, nice acting, good motives, the whole nine yards. He was set up to be an awesome MMORPG villain too- he’s an undead lich, how you gunna kill that?
---
Answer: dragon goes rawr XD and it’s game over. Lame. So. Freaking. Lame.
---
We started the game with dragons being this massive force of nature, but we have since spiraled into “alright, I’m gunna go 1v1 this dragon and kick it’s trash”.
---
That’s super lame to me.
---
&gt;Clueless Anet whiteknight spotted, time to nope out!
---
Actually, I didn’t care for GW1 and I didn’t care for GW2 until the past couple years. I don’t really care about Anet and the moment a better MMO comes out, that’s where I’ll be. I’m just objective when I talk about MMOs unlike the emotive whiners who comment incessantly around here and the trolls who don’t even play any more and haven’t for years, but come here to talk shit just for the hell of talking shit. It’s funny how lacking some of you are of self awareness.
---
When any time anybody says anything positive at all about Anet or GW2  your first instinct is to call them an Anet white knight, and it happens super frequently, then maybe it’s time to pull your head out of your ass.
---
&gt;The top and spread of a mmr system depends on its amount of players. Pvp ladder going down in rating over time proves a steady loss of players.
---
PvP is and has always consistently been composed of a minority of players across MMOs, people just don’t really care that much about competition in fantasy games. A loss in PvP player base is an indicator that the PvP system just isn’t that good, not that it matters because this is a full fledged MMO, not a lobby for a game that’s strictly PvP. Sometimes you just have to face the facts, the facts being that people just generally don’t like the game mode that you love on the game you play. There are tons of competitive games that are lobby based, maybe it’s time for you to look into that. That’s not what GW2 aims to be.
---
&gt;As far as anet is concerned, revenue is down and so is the size of their studio.
---
Anet’s revenue has been at a slow but steady decline since launch but ever since the WoW controversies, there’s been an uptick in profits. GW2 has also seen recent population growth directly related to WoW’s population decline. Where all this is going to go is up in the air for now, only time will tell. You gotta pay more attention to current trends and updated data if you’re going to make claims like that.
---
&gt;You demand numbers for my claims but provide none for your own. Believe as you wish, have fun with the crowded pvp lobbies lul.
---
You’re the one who started making claims about a drop in playerbase to begin with, ill go search for data when you provide your own data. See I’m on mobile and it would be a chore for me, I’m not going to bother wasting my time if you’re not even going to be serious about this and provide data to back your own claims. For all I know you’re just trolling. Stop being such a little bitch, if you’re serious provide some data to back your own initial claim.
---
&gt;I dont say much with regards to pve = casual. I'm saying story and open world = casual. And that's the only pve content they put out. Let's not pretend the content isnt made so anyone, even a monkey, can complete it. There is no challenge or difficulty to any of the content anet has released lately.
---
Heart of Thorns maps were specifically designed the way they were **because** there was an outcry from the “hardcore” crowd that open world content was too easy. On launch, you couldn’t even get around very well because you had to get around on foot and unlock your glider, and you didn’t even have mounts. You died A LOT, things were hitting **hard** especially if all you had was exotics. People used to fail metas even with full maps. If you did story alone at that time with exotics and likely not even an elite spec, you were going to die a lot. There’s nothing “casual” about that. Many strictly PvE players also engage in fractals and raids. I would even say a vast majority of players at least dabble in fractals and raids. 
---
You’re not “hardcore” just because you log in every day at the same time to run raids with the same group. In literally any other game that would be a baseline entry into endgame content, and the hardcore stuff would be way worse. You “hardcore” players need to fucking chill, you’re not that good. You likely play worse than people who only log in for like an hour a day but you call those people casual. It’s really sad how seriously you guys take yourselves even though you’re probably jobless and obese mid 20’s nerds who have nothing better to do than play video games all day.
---
Springer? Easy. Get the raptor up to its third mastery level, and go into the Desert Highlands to do a heart and pick up your springer. 
---
This specific skin? It's probably going to be 2000 gems on the gem store. Which, at the current exchange rate (100 gold for 271 gems according to GW2Efficiency) is about 738 gold. Alternatively, spend real money on it (25 USD).
---
&gt; For me it feels like the the dragons are holding the lore hostage.
---
Oh, but that's so true. I was hoping after putting Jorg/Primordy back to sleep that we could stop having this, then shit ramped up to 11 with Kralk *going into the mists* as a threat. Like, shonen-manga level of escalation that was completely unnecessary.
---
What chapter is that because you are right when they did the whole re doing of the story in 2014 there was a chapter missing I believe it was the greatest fear chapter that was re added in 2015 when they made Arah soloable.
---
If they want to disallow mounts they can do a better job of working that into the lore/canon than "it's too cold" considering most gear our characters wear won't work for sub-zero temps, the Norn don't give a crap about the cold, and half our mount skins are like "fiery raptor" or "ghost blah blah" and even the canonical jackal is *made of sand* and can teleport so what gives?
---
It is not too much to ask for slightly more convincing contrivances than "it's *too cold* for your mount!"
---
Necro/Anything, if you seriously need a healer, Firebrand.
---
Necro/Mesmer for easy content.
---
No. If it was a joke, you suck and should not quit your day job. If it was sarcasm, get a clue about how sarcasm works on text.
---
On the one hand, interested players could just buy gems every month. 
---
But, there's something about a steady, no-thought investment that could help GW2 quite a bit. Track what the subscribers are doing, and that gives a different approach to what content to develop, instead of focusing on gem store cosmetics. 
---
As long as the subscription doesn't give an unfair boost in power or earnings, I'd be fine with the idea.
---
and you will get bored of it in a 4 days
---
guardian for everything. they could be great dps and healer (support) for all contents -open world pve, raids, fractals, pvp and wvw.
---
That's 4 days of temporary joy.
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for opting to spend my own money on a game I enjoy. Spiteful ass community
---
I just wish there was a quality button in the video player so we could actually choose our resolution manually for desktop users.
---
Even the canonical jackal is literally made of sand and wind. I would expect its cold tolerance to be at least as good as that of a half-naked human who would struggle in even the southern Shiverpeaks, let alone where we're headed.
---
I used to use it all the time but then I got the other versions.
---
Nowadays I only use the rune thingy one
---
&gt;The year post hot was a financial problem because they spent 9 months not releasing content. 
---
That was the year they released most of the raid stuff, as well as Bloodstone Fen, Ember Bay, Bitterfrost Frontier, Lake Doric, and Draconis Mons.The doldrums only lasted through the first quarter or two of 2016 (aside from the raids, of course, but nobody liked those), and Q1 2016 was actually pretty decent (glider sales, I assume?). 
---
Here's my theory: Around $15m is about GW2's "natural level" at this point, post raids. All else being equal, that's how much they make per quarter. When an Expansion hits, they get a short term bump in sales due to boxes flying out the door, but it's only equivalent to about one bonus quarter. More notably, I think that glider sales accounted for the 16Q1 bump, and that mount skins account for the stronger early 2018 sales. I think that when they add a new thing to skin, players snap up early skins, settle into one that they like, and then that market mostly dries up once they reach equilibrium. 
---
Presumably, whatever the state is, ANet is aware of this, and have much better data than we do, and this is the path they've chosen. This would *seem* to mean that they are either fine with $15m per quarter revenues, and believe that they can maintain that with their existing options, *or* that they plan to introduce new monetization options over the course of s5 that, while it wouldn't have the "burst damage" of an expansion, would produce the same "sustain" that they do. A pessimist might say that the build templates were intended to be that new revenue stream, but I highly doubt it. They way they designed it was just never likely to take off like that.
---
well thats how it works, You give wings so players buy then as they would feel bad without wings when they see other players with wings. Then you need to give even more ridiculous wings so players with wings would want to buy them as they are more then they normal wings.  
---
  
---
Long story short, its visual power creep. You need bigger, flashier, more anoying things as time goes on to keep selling them.
---
i'll believe it once we actually get any expansion quality content
---
There are 9 base classes
---
Light | Medium | Heavy
---
-----|------|-----
---
Necromancer | Ranger | Warrior
---
Mesmer | Thief | Guardian
---
Elementalist | Engineer | Revenant
---
And each base class has two elite specializations, which are max level modifications to each class that change how the class is slightly played, along with unlocking a new set of skills and weapons for available use. Firebrand and scourge are specializations of the guardian and necromancer respectively.
---
In general, there are no dedicated tank classes, and until you get to max level, there aren't really any dedicated healer classes either. There are classes that happen to tank in particular raid conditions, but they aren't built like a tank, they're often built as a support/healer role.
---
Ignore them and take solace in the fact that every purchase makes their angry little baby brains shrivel faster
---
If you mean the actual PS, no, there's nothing missing. It's all there. If you mean season 1, then yeah that's missing but that's not PS anymore.
---
As long as you've logged in, you have the current episode unlocked, regardless of whether you've played the content
---
That being said, today is the last day, the next episode is out tomorrow
---
It's definitely worth it, for me it was super convenient to not having to buy salvage kits from time to time.  
---
But I suggest you to buy it when it goes on discount.
---
&gt; Anet when will you care?
---
Look at GW1's PvP (a gamemode of a game that they are still supporting), that is the future of GW2's PvP :)
---
You sure it's not the words "entitled," "condescending," and "circlejerk" that would bring in the downvotes? Not a great way to prove a point when you fail to control for language.
---
Definitely worth it but I only use mine on blues or greens.
---
My mystic salvage kits are saved for rares and exotics are saved for the black lion salvage kits, if they're worth salvaging.
---
you should stop thinking in my content and your content and read what i wrote again. collections are a rewards. worse then standardized quests from other mmos even, there you at least have content tied to it. collecting all trash items has no story to it. collecting all treasure items has no story to it. collecting all skins x has no story to it. those are simply rewards.
---
content is doing tequatl, octovine, or various other openworld events...doing hearts, quests....thats content.
---
oh god.. and i thought the armor 2 weeks ago was awful
---
Maintenance mode bois.
---
Demon wings...blindfolded eyes...
---
I've sacrificed everything. What have you given?
---
It's purely a convenience item, IMO its worth it. Basically you use the copper fed one for greens/blues, and the mystics for rare/exotic.
---
People are "whining" bc the flavor doesn't make any sense whatsoever. They could've just left it at the usual "mounts are disabled for this area" but instead they decided to add a line of flavor that doesn't work whatsoever.
---
First thing: if your time is severly limited, you dont have time for an mmo.
---
Second thing: if you're such a huge hikikomori and don't have a guild, maybe mmo is not for you, especially a 'social' mmo like gw2
---
Third thing: be smart about things like that. There are many people who are on those maps, you rarely need more than two other people, assuming all of you have both hands and all buttons on your keyboards. In case of bounties, those indeed can berm harder, which is why its a good idea to tag up, call a bounty run in ATM +10, do legendary bosses, do your boss, and ditch the team.
---
You can do that stuff. Indeed, not being able to replay ls1 is a minus, I'd love to see fractals like the full nightmare tower, with carrying canisters and whatnot, and raids like marionette. But the core idea stands, if you're not there when the content is out, you are behind and you are supposed to be behind. If you weren’t there when skyscale was released, tough luck, do all the puzzles w/o kind mesmers porting you, and use skyscale treats for stuff you cant solo and are unwilling to wait.
---
Maybe its my elitism or whatnot, but segregation of people in an mmo is a good thing, because if everyone has equal footing always, you dont see anyone behind you, but you dont see anyone ahead either. Amd what's the point of achieving something if it can be done by just about anyone? How would you feel if a newbie at your job started off with the same salary you have now, because to have him start with a lower one would be unfair and, Kormir forbid, he'd feel left out?
---
copper fed for masterwork and lower, just right click and salvage all of those. mystic salvage kit for rares, sell exotics and rare greatswords. If you get an exotic with a pricey sigil, black lion and sell the sigil.
---
Maybe I put it too brutal. I actually like GW2 story a lot! I read a lot about it, watched lore videos on youtube and story in general is the main reason I play video games at all.  It's just Personal Story is noticably worse than the rest of the story parts and I couldn't really enjoy it fully because it was so rushed and not developed enough. It's not bad, it's just bland in comparison. I get it's an old content and that many people spend countless hours working on it but I'm just saying that a little refresh (even just dialogues and interactions for better introduction and explanation of the characters, no new missions or sth) would make this content more consistent with the rest of the game. Especially because this is the very first experience for new players. But I get your point and I really enojoy newer story parts a lot! :) They improved so much and I'm very curious about the Icebrood Saga to see what they came up with :)
---
They look sick.
---
A mount wheel...get rid of the free one that works well.
---
Oooh I never heard about it :) Can you tell me more? Do you remember what it was about? :)
---
Yeah, I Know a cute Handheld one. Usually does fractals with me
---
Wait for black friday
---
do you remember about actual events ? it was a cool little thing
---
WvW-related. Don't expect much.

Improved LFG revamp - LFG Finder

I agree, I'm only a user but you can see in so many design decisions that they making pc more like mobile, it is like they didn't learn from window 8. But with the case of twitter it makes sense since I bet most of the people who visit twitter are on mobile, I found a statistic for it and [93% of video views on Twitter happen on mobile](https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-statistics/). They should put in some better options on twitter but it is unlikely a high priority twitter.
---
I remmeber Whetospu was well known in the past cuz of his skill and abillity to solo almost every content in pre HoT era. I think many veterans remmeber him.
---
That would be nice and maybe allow verified users/companies some higher limits on upload size.
---
Yeah.. I honestly don't understand this subreddit. It's like they try to alienate people who are looking for rational discussion. I wished we could give critique and feedback on this game without being demonized.
---
LMAO, you are so pitiful. Not good at thinking, huh?
---
What do you think how phishing works? Lmao...
---
I agree. Exactly the same for me.
---
Is this... CONTENT?  *insert meme here*
---
Turns out telling people to just take a break and stop playing your game isn't a very good strategy.
---
Aww, dang, dulfy has some of the best guides
---
I agree it's the best out there for MMORPGs  IMO.

Clearly these skins are making big money for them, so technically they are very much listening to what some players want. Money talks louder than words.
---
Bunny traverses cliffs far faster than skyscale. Skyscale just happens to be a combination of griffon and bunny where it's not better at what either specialize in but is pretty close.
---
PvP is FFXIV is largely unplayed because it's boring and awful. My point is if you have a 15+ minute queue, does it matter if it's because there's too many people or not enough? 15 mins is 15 mins.

You may want to look up the definition of entitled, I get it, you like buzzwords but still.
---
Sorry but the person you reply to is the perfect example of why you shouldn't listen to low-skill players for advice.
---
"You can stack wells and wait till people walk into them and die" isn't a thing outside of low-elo which isn't relevant for balance or gameplay. They're literally people playing without thinking, then he accuses those players of going for no-brain gameplay. 
---
It's like playing league of legends in bronze and then complaining that master yi is an inbalanced brainless champion with no counterplay. It sure might be an effective noobstomping strategy but it's irrelevant once people get past these basic L2P issues. 
---
Exact same for PvE. They nerfed every bit of interesting combat to the ground to avoid any challenges or difficulties. Then he goes "look it's brainless!" Of course it is - that's the type of content and player left in this game. Everyone else has moved on because it's clear in what direction all gameplay and gamemodes must go under the demands of /THE/ gw2 playerbase. W1 or W2 release weren't health sponges - they became that after absurd powercreep. 
---
They don't offer any insight or examples of how GW2 combat relies on intricacies because they literally do not know them.
---
Eh. Hard disagree. Still don't have proper pants/shirts or disco roller beetle.
---
Same here. even my griffon is feeling jealous.
---
Perspective. I'm not one to agree with doomsday theories that easily, and I say this as someone who was extremely angry with how they handled the LS5 presentation back in August and the lack of upcoming expansion (or expansion-worthy features). I'm not hyped for tomorrow's release, not as much as I was during LS4 because now I know that's all we'll get in the near future. 
---
However, the decision of replacing an expansion with LS5 came before the layoffs. If they were really hungry for money, you'd think they would have gone the easy route and focus on elites + a bundle of maps all at once and call it expansion 3, it's a guaranteed purchase for most of the playerbase. But they didn't, for whatever reasons. So I don't think their earnings are as low as we think... But what do I know really.
---
and one more thing, you say gw2 is special compared to other games because it has no normal quests, hearts are so much better because dynamic and whatnot.  
---
for the most part of collections when it comes to new maps for the last few years it was excatly like kill ten rats quests...just collect 30 coins. collect 1k ores. collect 5k plants.  
---
it literally does nothing like other games since ages now, just that there are no npc's arround which give you a quest where you have to collect 10 ores because their feudal lord demands so else they get thrown in prison or so.  
---
no, you simply have it in your fucking log and when its done you get some arbitrary 5 AP where the next rewards is withing 100 other collections. YOU DO NOT EVEN GET REWARDED INSTANTLY.  
---
how brainwashed from pr talk and nostalgic feelings can a single person be to think that arena net has such a special game with gw2 when the overall quality since release has dropped in every single department APART from story telling.
---
Thanks, I guess it's time to learn the catacombs, spend some gold, and add that to my daily routine. I don't know why they'd make this particular set so difficult.
---
you know, I would really love if there were casual skins. would bring that maple story vibe to it
---
lol
---
It's never a good time to get into a sinking ship.
---
then leave
---
Hmm...and in the first case diviner/zerker can I modify it in order to get into raids or not?
---
Hard xD
---
that is what happens in Zelda BotW...i am pretty sure they understood you just fine.
---
So glad she was gone. That attitude is absolute cancer.
---
Also, ANET wouldn't do shit to help recover hacked GW1 accounts, but bent over backwards when their own shit security measures allowed someone to get her account. Only way you can get your hacked GW1 account restored? Your name has to be Gail Gray.
---
Until you explain what you're referring to I'm just going to assume you've never opened a dictionary before.
---
Yes. I say diviner/berserker loosely because you should use as many diviner pieces as you need to do your job in a raid (80% boon duration is a good starting point for a new chrono). As you improve, you can switch pieces to berserker to increase your DPS. But no matter how much diviner or berserker you use, you can simply swap to DPS chrono traits and be ready for general PvE.
---
Its been like this since the day they added Wings as a back items and has only gotten worse from there.
---
The unfinished jumping puzzle behind the AC paths 1 and 3, if you climb the stairs and when on top pass through the bush/shrub thing
---
If they are selling, it means that people are enjoying them, so, they are listening to the community. Money just talks louder than posts on Reddit.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think that some gemstore stuff is out of context and kind of ruins the environment, but it is what it is.
---
To be honest this skin doesn't bother me nearly as much as some other skins in the game (wintersday mounts for example)
---
LOL! I can only imagine how weird American can seem at times for non-americans.
---
I think they mean that they want to buy shared inventory slots as a gift for someone else, like you can do with other items in the gem store. 
---
However, shared inventory slots are classed as account upgrades, and account upgrades cannot be gifted.
---
Killing Lord in pvp LMAO.
---
To be fair it seemed clear that their intent the whole time was to have Lazarus be Balthazar in disguise, but yeah the foreshadowing was not there.
---
&gt;Dps+tank or dps+healer?
---
That's not how this game works
---
I would say Firebrand+Renegade or Berserker+Chronomancer
---
&gt; even new sets come with 5 skins out of 8
---
Because no would pay 3000 gems for a skin pack for 8 mounts, right? ....right?
---
8 years eh? Look at you optimist.
---
&gt; Bunny traverses cliffs far faster than skyscale. 
---
Yes, but the skyscale gives a bigger margin for error since you can control your landing better.
---
lil bb is stroking out
---
Chronomancers would have [looked interesting](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/b/b1/%22Chronomancer%22_concept_art_4.jpg), and their [clockwork city](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/b/b6/%22The_Hub_of_Time%22_concept_art.jpg). Would have been nice to see. It's clear though that Utopia would have taken GW in a completely different direction to where GW2 ended up going.
---
Big grains of salt for the following information, which is vague, some of it has been given by devs and some of that same info later contradicted or denied, and some of it's just speculation based on trying to interpret concept art:
---
&gt;According to Linsey Murdock, Utopia was not set on Tyria but rather within The Mists. The land was a sort of **home or playground of the Gods of Tyria**, and was to feature an **expanded pantheon of the gods, such as Dwayna's father**. It would also feature characters from across the timeline, and both Gwen and Mordakai, Devona's father, were to be main characters.
---
&gt;Although the PC Gamer article heavily implies that the plans for Utopia were scrapped and the initial plan for GW2 were started at the same time, there is a possibility that this is not the case, and Utopia, not Eye of the North was intended to be a bridge to GW2. Indeed, it is known that multiple races were intended to be introduced in Utopia, **such as the Sidhe** (which later became the concept for the Sylvari).
---
&gt;The plot of Utopia seems to have focused on the ruins of some earlier civilization. The Asuran constructs known as golems seem to feature in artwork in multiple different forms. Many depict the golems as - contrary to the existing image of shiny, almost modern constructs - older looking, more statue-like beings. They are also depicted as being a fairly old technology, with one piece of art showing a deactivated golem overgrown with plants and weeds. In any case, it can be assumed that they played a fairly large part in Utopia. It is not known whether their creators, the Asura, were also featured in the game.
---
&gt;Destroyers were also possibly featured in Utopia, albeit not as we know them. Early concept art for "Taneks", "Tanecks" or "Tanneks" (the actual spelling is unknown) feature fleshy, piglike creatures. Later concept art, also entitled tannek.jpg or something similar features the Destroyers as we know them.
---
So yeah, taking that at its face value, it's clear that we were heading in a completely different direction. I cannot find it right now, but I recall another dev stating that the original story plan for GW2 was that it was going to be about a war between angels and demons, where Tyria was the battleground. With that in mind, I would generally tend to believe that the earliest plans for Utopia were setting up all this extra information for this divine war (like the expanded pantheon of gods) which was dropped.
---
We'd probably see: the realms of the other 3 main gods (in GW1, we only saw Grenth's and Balthazar's - and technically Kormir's, but it was still being cleaned up as it had only recently stopped being Abaddon's), so a realm for Melandru, Lyssa and Dwayna. Probably get more information and places in the mists to do with Demons, expanded lore on how they form. And maybe even information about what "angels" were (maybe just as simple as being "good" demons made up of positive emotions as opposed to a "bad" demon's negative emotions, or something like that). So a big focus on the Mists.
---
I don't know if gem cards are still a thing, but that's also an option for a gift for gw2 fan.
---
I fucking hate those holographic wings since they day they were released. This was the start of glowing garbage.
---
It would make sense that there's a preview for what ANet decided to be the most expensive high-end items, right?
---
Well not in this game!
---
Could send them the gold and with a message of what they should spend it on. Not as exciting
---
you dont have to run the meta to get the wyvern. if you have a mount you can just go to the area and pick one up anytime. without a mount you will have to sneak past mobs and bouncy mushroom/leyline glide to the wyverns.
---
Thank you so much! I will surely watch it :)
---
Thanks for the reminder. Didn't get to play this weekend.
---
I just want a Griffon race through the first image and a ~~Sonic~~ Beetle race through the last one!
---
You spent so much time refuting what I was saying and no time whatsoever coming up with your own examples. The short of it is basically “this guy is an asshole for not providing a helpful answer but I’m not going to either.” How about you stop being a hypocrite and tell us how exactly PvP can be improved, besides banning all bots, hackers, and match throwers.
---
New Mount skins with legendary like effects. What's with that visual clutter?
---
I wonder if they ever implement legendary skins for mounts which you can obtain through collections. I'm calling it now lel.
---
1 - taste is subjective
---
2 - I'm supporting a company that has provided me with years of content and enjoyment. That'll not change.
---
3 - you'd really get triggered by the amount of gems I buy monthly.
---
4 - tell me.how you REALLY feel.
---
[wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga#Dates_of_free_access) entry for Icebrood Saga states that Bound By Blood is part of the usual free-access period model
---
the next level: autorun activated to afk on walls.
---
Which it doesn’t
---
Not my cup of tea.
---
The execution of the Elder Dragons in-game hasn't always been to my taste, but personally I find the idea way more interesting than a war between gods. Using dragons puts the focus on Tyria itself and the nature of the world, rather than being an incidental setting for some war between beings that don't even live in the world.
---
Not my job to come up with a better reason. I can still say the one in the strike is not convincing.
---
Only Permanent if you login during the free window. Otherwise it is likely 200 gems like other chapters or part of the season pack. Nothing to claim I don't believe, just play sometime in the last couple of months (Since September or so). Can't look up the date at the moment.
---
You need to spend money to have fun in game?
---
i think the rotation is fine as is unless they want to rotate festivals in and out of the lineup to make room for new festivals without bloating the calendar even more.  6 festival slots a year is plenty.  We do need breather periods between festivals and while living world releases do accomplish this in a way...a living world release in and of itself is treated like an extended festival because it's new content.
---
I could see dragon bash being replaced by a different norn centric festival for 2020 since 2019's edition was in-story specific.  I don't know if it should connect with Icebrood Saga or be something more fixed like a large moot in hoelbrak or a celebration of the spirits.  connect queen's gauntlet concept with the norn festival as it fits the norn idea of a holiday more than human and we got a super mini form of a PoC with the mini strike mission encounter during dragon's bash.
---
You probably have, just haven't realized it. Bots today are way more sophisticated than a decade ago.
---
Added a guy to my friendlist during halloween because I wanted to dodge him for still playing scourge. Found out had had 700 achie points, 100 games played already, and was basically farming lab and ranked all day. Pretty sure that's a bot.
---
Jormag's voice has gotten significantly more feminine since the announcement, hasn't it?
---
Personally, I don't even like most of the outfits. Ice Encasement, Starborn, Dynamics Exo-Suit, Inquest Exo-Suit, Lunatic Guard, Mad King's, Mist Stranger, Raiment of the Lich, and Taimi's are the only ones I personally enjoy. That's eight out of out what, 92 outfits? And a few of those, like the HoT outfit and the Birthday Armor, are free.
---
Still, even if all 92 were super good and cost gems, the amount of decent armor obtainable through in-game methods still vastly outweighs that.
---
Feels like a chorus effect for different pitches, which works for Jormag's concept.
---
Congratulations on crafting an entirely pointless response that addresses nothing that I said, least of all the first part of my comment. But no, I'm not looking to go into video game development; not that it matters in the least. 
---
This idea that we should have to consider ArenaNet's workload, company structure, available resources and other constraints is absurd: when a corporation sells you a product, you, as a customer, should be allowed to judge the product on its own merits, and in comparison to the competition. If aspects of the game are subpar, they're supbar, and making excuses about mitigating circumstances does nothing to change the product for the end user, now does it?
---
that GW1 shiverpeaks music at the beginning gave me shivers
---
One of the few good and interesting plotlines and they killed it. It's sad. Also letters from E.
---
It would've gone better. Instead we got generic dragons woo-hoo...
---
Endless whining
---
I got fed up enough with my 5700 and bought a 2080. :/
---
i remember playing the game and reading about destiny's edge coming back after a long break ; doing the story and have couple of people i've never met seen or heard of talk to me like we're buds
---
\*THIS\* seems to have fixed it! Thank you!!!
---
copper feed is best salvage kit for blues and greens without a rune
---
GW2's dragons are just about the least generic take on dragons I feel like I have ever seen...
---

When an indie developer releases a funky little 2D game that’s kinda buggy but is still pretty cool, you don’t review it like it’s a groundbreaking AAA title right? If you do then you’re kind of a dunce. Anet isn’t nearly the size of Blizzard and doesn’t have the same kind of resources so it’s a little bit forgivable that they’re not as diligent in their updates as blizzard, anybody would agree that’s a fair statement.
---
But let’s go even further, you wouldn’t review a dinner you got at Waffle House like you were comparing it to a Michelin 5 star restaurant’s gourmet desert waffle with hand crafted French vanilla ice cream on top, drizzled in the finest chocolate syrup money can buy, finished off with gold flake. You wouldn’t review a phone VR set like it was a $1500 current tech VR set. You wouldn’t return an aluminum pan to a store because it’s “not as good as the cast iron skillets you offer.” 
---
You know why you wouldn’t do any of those things? Because it’s dumb to that, and people who do those things get laughed at, rightfully so.
---
So settle down Karen, with your “I’m the customer and the customer is always right” attitude.
---
yes.
---
so warclaw still doesnt have a 2k gem skin and a bunny gets a 3rd???
---
New skin for gemstore right? Man I’m glad I decided to wait on the sun temple gecko into this Tuesday to see what they add. Of course, now I have a dilemma cause both are amazing
---
It is the prologue
---
Your comments on LW1 resonate massively with me as a new(ish) player!
---
Is there a way to lock windows in place? It's mostly for the bank window. The normal inventory stays where i put it, but the bank window always appears in the middle of the screen, but i want it more to the left so that it doesn't overlap the inventory.
---
Times changed. The glorious days of TT are sadly over. No one calls it so nowadays. Most of the early day vets are gone :(
---
Sorry to see all the downvotes. I am fairly new to GW2, but what I love about it is being able to do what I like, what suits me. I will very likely never participate in high level instanced PvE content such as raids and high tier fractals. It's pretty clear that these groups come with high expectations and high pressure to perform. I know that particular environment isn't for me. But I still have a ton of stuff to do and get a lot of enjoyment from playing the game. I can see myself sticking about for the long term. 
---
You make a good point and I agree.
---
Yes and no. People might expect all lore maniacs to feel this way, but as one myself, I don’t because every item from the gemstore exists in lore as items made by the black lion trading company. Some of the crazier things like living breathing mounts I think in my head aren’t actually made by them but bred and sold by them at least (or maybe they ARE made by them, the BLTC does some shady stuff)
---
pet arent mounts in this game bro.
---
I don't have alts on reddit.
---
Reasonable feedback. Surprised "condi hell watching your UI" didn't make your top 10 negatives.
---
Good point - but what if we didn't have to choose between gods and Elder Dragons exclusively. Let's say the plot of Utopia ended with GW1 and you could pick any other type of creatures and villains for the focus on Tyria in GW2.
---
Would you still choose Elder Dragons? Or maybe rather a setting that allows more varied, down-to-earth stories of different factions, alliances, creatures and races
---
I'm on Gunnars, not had an issue with German speakers. Plenty of ENG comms and Kodasch folk are friendly regardless. I've only reinstalled recently after taking a few years break. Not trying to poach, not trying to steal , just calling it how I see it. You're a big boy, you'll make the right choice I'm sure.
---
I agree with that I just don't see how anyone can be confident it will be any better with an NCSoft company person in charge. I've likened it before to jumping from the frying pan into the fire.
---
Go full berserker.   
---
If you wish to raid, you'll need another set anyway, but once you started doing fractals you'll be swimming in ascended boxes
---
I would never in my life buy one of those boring 'realistic' mount skins like maguuma jack rabbit or badlands stalker. And all the mounts I see in game? Fire and ice and lighting and glowing and shiny because that's what people actually want.
---
No unfortunately not.
---
Well, if you have logged in at any point between September 17th and now you already have it unlocked.
---
man i remember doing condi husks for EVOS runs waaaayy back, fun times watching zerg chaos ensue all around me while i quietly burn husks and loose larva eggs to the ground.
---
The other answer here covers it well, but I wanted to add that if you have WvW ranks and currency you can also complete hero challenges by buying them from a vendor in WvW.
---
random ppl on random internet forum downvoting some shit they dont understand? (its agains reedit rules btw)  (probably 5 fanboys which think that gw 2 is best game ever made and gona downvote every **diferent** opinion than their own. Make picture/draw of random shit remotely reminding something from game get 3 000 upvotes? im shocked good sir. GW2 forum is known to being one of the MOST toxic on reedit. One could say that with MILION players this will not be issue to find one person,who can swap/switch or wtf you doing in that game,if you wana play different class.
---
Well, obviously it can't handle the cold very well if it needs a scarf and earmuffs.
---
Logged in and got no notification or anything. I'll see tomorrow, I guess.
---
Looks like other gave you some good build advice, but if you're coming from other rpgs you should also know that every character I'm gw2 is super squishy by traditional rpg standards.
---
Combat is more of a dance than standing and taking hits. It's all about understand every way you have to mitigate, avoid or heal damage and use them conservatively to survive.
---
If you're doing a fight well you often don't take any substantial hits at all, or very few. Hope some of that helps!
---
account upgrades can't be gifted. The main reason for it is that there's a limit to them and you can't know how many the recipient already got..... and that could lead to many troubles like asking support for refunds.
---
one thing you should know is that there's no such thing as "new character zones" in this game. the zones that your new characters load into after the intro are just normal low-level maps, most of which even have world bosses
---
I mean PvP used to have iconic players like ostricheggz, ItsMeMarvin and a few others i can't remember because it's literally been 4 years or more, but after they added PvE rewards to Pvp all of that kind of vanished. Also, the lack of competitive play despite it having one of the best Pvps i've personally played.
---
I think that’s the goal. In the Reveal Event, they kinda touched on the fact that this season will delve into the fact that the elder dragons are a lot more than we initially thought. I mean, Mordremoth already kinda revealed that they’re much more than just a natural brute force. Not only that, but think about dragons like Glint, Vlast, and Aurene. Aurene especially now that she has ascended. She’s much more than just a brute force. She’s shown herself to be a highly intelligent, self aware creature.
---
They’ve already confirmed that in the Bound by Blood trailer she is addressing Bangar, correct?
---
That makes sense but in this case I did ask.
---
I'm glad you have no artistic talent, cuz otherwise it would be another *look what I drew* post.
---
Core guardian is quite strong though it has fallen a bit out of the limelight lately. It's still a powerhouse though.

Obviously.

Meanwhile, I'm stuck sitting here, waiting on an SMS verification code that isn't arriving, locked out of my own account because I'm on crummy hotel Wifi in a place where I should have plenty of signal, but instead appear to be in the middle of nowhere.
---
Chronomancers looked cool and I was thinking how cool it would have been to play a mesmer/chronomancer. It was so long ago so I have no idea if any chronomancer skills were leaked.
---
&gt;When an indie developer releases a funky little 2D game that’s kinda buggy but is still pretty cool, you don’t review it like it’s a groundbreaking AAA title right?
---
But ArenaNet isn't some tiny little indie developer and they're not making a funky little 2D game. You're making a false equivalence by comparing things that differ by several orders of magnitude and then implying that the same comparison is applicable to the matter at hand.
---
&gt;But let’s go even further, you wouldn’t review a dinner you got at Waffle House like you were comparing it to a Michelin 5 star restaurant’s gourmet desert waffle with hand crafted French vanilla ice cream on top, drizzled in the finest chocolate syrup money can buy, finished off with gold flake. You wouldn’t review a phone VR set like it was a $1500 current tech VR set. You wouldn’t return an aluminum pan to a store because it’s “not as good as the cast iron skillets you offer.”
---
You're again making comparisons that are absurd in the context, or are you saying that Guild Wars 2 is equivalent to Waffle House and, for instance, World of Warcraft is a 5 star restaurant? On what basis are you making that comparison? The price? The fact that Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a subscription? I'll grant that it is certainly possible to play Guild Wars 2 a lot cheaper than it is to play World of Warcraft, but make no mistake: Guild Wars 2 isn't subscription free out of the kindness in ArenaNet's hearts. It's subscription free because they thought they could make more money with microtransactions that way (which the entire game is designed around, incidentally). Making a price comparison between the two is difficult because it's going to vary a lot from person to person, so I can only speak for myself, but I've easily spent as much or more money on Guild Wars 2 as I did during my years playing WoW.
---
&gt;You know why you wouldn’t do any of those things? Because it’s dumb to that, and people who do those things get laughed at, rightfully so.
---
Yes, I *would* get laughed at, if that was what I was doing, but I'm not. You've simply painted a picture of ridiculous extremes and then pretended that they're equivalent to comparing Guild Wars 2 to other MMOs.
---
&gt;So settle down Karen, with your “I’m the customer and the customer is always right” attitude.
---
Nice, so we're getting to ad hominems now.
---
&gt;If your boss all of a sudden started reviewing your work performance based on the standards and work ethic displayed by the top workers at Amazon warehouses and they started docking your pay because you’re just not cutting it? I bet you’d be pretty upset. But they are like customers and you are providing your services to them in the form of labor and time, so should they be as harsh on you? I dunno, by your logic I guess they should be doing that.
---
This example is so mind-boggingly impertinent that I don't really know what to say to it.
---
I've heard that a lot through the years. I don't run a guild any more ( haven't for about a year and a half) But I was a part of the leadership of the guild all the way back to gw1 (07, I believe). 
---
It seriously takes a lot to run a successful guild, not even including luck. --Esp in gw2 where there is a lack of infrastructure. I'd say my guild lucked out. I found 4 or 5 really good individuals to be officers that were open minded, socially cunning, polite/mature, fine with leadership, and really took care of things when I was away (I was away often, due to work/schooling). They were older, and lived full lives so they were always in rotation, but we'd always meet up and do content once or twice a week. There were even months where I had to break for commitments and they covered.
---
We grew slowly. Then we absorbed another smaller guild because they enjoyed playing with us. This group represented a way for new recruits to join the core group. A good road from newbie to steady member. So we always had a steady increase of members because they felt at home due to the "Core group" and this intermediate more casual group. A small group of Irl friends could be considered in this as well. People could always do dungeons, fractals, and different content with them regardless of skill.
---
Finding these people to help maintain a healthy guild was truly lucky. I even met 7 of my members irl (I travel a lot for work) and we occasional talk on discord.
---
What did us in? Time and maybe a lack of content/guild infrastructure. I'd say the average age was mid/upper 20s. A turbulent time and many of my officers were in their thirties. So folks started having kids, or starting new jobs. After I had a traumatizing relationship end, I started my own business so I had to leave my position as a leader. 
---
At our tip top shape, I'd say we had about 150ish\~ primetime online members average for a year, but for the bulk we'd have a solid 50 primetime. Good memories and interesting people though.
---
Rytlock's Critter Rampage for PS4 and Xbox confirmed.
---
probably upcoming stuff like Ps5 or VR in general.
---
Thank you for helping remind everyone OP.
---
It's actually possible, since anet is mentally stuck far behind current trends.
---
How do you know what seems too much for them. Speaking from your own experience? I was new once and I never had your problems.
---
You have a very low opinion about new players. If they get to max level they won't moan about endgame prices.
---
Late reply and will probably be missed, but I've had the problem with disconnects during unskippable cut scenes for the last few years - I've never solved it. As a result I've only finished the main story on one character, have only got half way through HoT and PoF and any living world episode that has a similar cutscene disconnects. But I have no issue in fractals.
---
I've tried all these support steps:
---
*     disabled non-essential services
---
*     sorted startup programs
---
*     changed dns source to openDNS
---
*     opened up all router ports required
---
*     played videos in the background and pressed all the buttons all of the time during cutscenes
---
*     ran their support tool twice and sent the reports in
---
*     did traceroutes and contacted isp
---
* ran /ipconfig flushdns
---
* ran netsh winsock reset
---
Non of which really worked. The only thing that worked for a time was going via a VPN but even that stopped working after a while. 
---
tbh i've not tried it for a long time, i was getting so frustrated not being able to finish key missions  that i've not logged any significant game time for ages.  
---
be interested if you find a solution!
---
LOl The feature does not have any bugs, you clearly do not know what QA even means.
---
And FYI idiot I am a dev and if a feature this advanced did not get QA time it would be riddled with bugs
---
Also as a dev that has to read feedback from fucking shit bag neckbeards like yourself I assure you when thousands of you assholes offer basically zero constructive criticism and whine that nothing has been done weeks after NOTHING ever gets changed.
---
So keep whining about the cost, keep whining about the fact you have not been told that you are right I would bet you a trillion fucking dollars, because you are behaving like an entitled piece of shit your gonna get nothing.  It is too bad that since you are a white male you do not understand that it is a privilege to get anything from whining.
---
Thief has the lowest health pool among classes, tied with Guardian and Elementalist, so it's understandable that surviving is tough at times. Using some Marauders gear while you're getting used to expansion-level combat sounds like it would be very helpful. Compared to full Berserker's, full Marauder's is about a 50% HP increase for a \~10% DPS loss. Also you should definitely take [Invigorating Precision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invigorating_Precision) (last trait in Critical Strikes traitline) in open world, you'll have a lot more lifesteal sustain.
---
If you have enough hero points, the elite specs might also help with combat. For Daredevil, the extra dodge bar, plus the evade frames in staff3 and staff5, allow you to avoid a lot of damage once you get used to really using them. There's also the [Marauder's Resilience](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marauder's_Resilience) trait which gives you extra health and reduced incoming damage.
---
Deadeye is a more glass-cannony spec, but you can try that route if you want to kill enemies faster than they can kill you. Taking the [Be Quick or Be Killed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Be_Quick_or_Be_Killed) trait gives you quickness when you mark an enemy, as well as bonus power and precision when you have quickness. Self-quickness is extremely nice for instantly melting enemies (Deadeye with dagger/dagger and rifle is my personal go-to spec for open world shenanigans).
---
son,if you think that 20g is ENDGAME price,you didnt seen much ENDGAME items.
---
&gt; war between angels and demons
---
That sounds a bit like Aion...
---
Ok, thanks.
---
Something not otherwise mentioned is that after you've finished the Jackal mastery track; all of your mounts will evade when you use endurance. This is a big improvement for all mounts.
---
Considering how "good" GW2 engine works, this only may mean they wanna port it as [console program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application) /s
---
Oh I thought it had to be today or tomorrow.. Allright that's good to hear, thanks!
---
I avoided buying this for a long time despite hearing people sing its praises. I don't have a lot of gold and I dont buy gems often, so when I do, I like to buy things I can get excited about like mounts skins, etc. Recently I bought a whole dump of gems and forced myself to buy the dumb thing.  
---
Very happy with the decision, but it still frustrates me to think about the fact that item management was so bad in the base game that we have to pay another ten bucks for a feature that makes it run like it should have from day 1.
---
EVOS runs were always nice.  I remember running many runs with them as worked on the achievement.
---
The only reason now is a good time to give guild wars another try is because a lot of people playing classic WoW are starting to get bored with that and might check out other old games. :(
---
&gt; LOl The feature does not have any bugs
---
It has a crapton of bugs, just to name a few:
---
* it completely fucks with revenant utility orders.
---
* Since manually swapping a traitline counts as swapping a template to the game, it re-equips all youjr utility skills meaning: presses shadow return, deletes shadow portal, kills spirits, uncharges mantras, etc.
---
* Upgrades get removed from legendaries (lmao) unless it's exclusively template 1.
---
* It has an exploit where you can dupe certain account bound infusions, it also has a way to delete them but couldn't find the right set of steps to repro.
---
&gt; It is too bad that since you are a white male you do not understand that it is a privilege to get anything from whining.
---
black girl actually owo
---
The list goes on and on and many have already wrote about it, including myself.
---
I thought your opinion was moronic but reality is you are as well.
---
That probably was already said million of times, but this is yet another "micro" transaction worth more (it's 2k gem \~25$ i suppose?) than a whole expansion. This has to stop... This is just anti consumer bullshit.
---
And don't even start with: support the game you love, just trade gold to gem or any other similar response. This is not OK and you know it, stop finding excuses.
---
There was supposed to be another battle on the ground after we knocked Zhaitan out of the air with the cannons in Victory or Death. It was cut before release and left us with a lame ending to the story.
---
&gt; I guess he's talking about living story season one.
---
No, I'm talking about exactly what I said. There was originally another chapter planned with a ground battle after we knocked Zhaitan out of the air in Victory or Death.
---
Hey Man could i get like 3 for my family they love gw2

---
Down vote correct info. gg... Instead of believing the downvotes, click the link, sort by core, diviner \\o/
---
We introduce to you the new look of Kratosa in, "Goddess of war XII!"
---
Looks good, but consider moving some of your armor's diviner stats to the trinkets if you can. Those are much cheaper to obtain (and later swap out) than armor pieces.
---
One of the few must-buys in the gem store.
---
Does the skimmer perma evade while hovering higher? That's mega nice lol.
---
Utopia architecture has been implemented though. It's called asuran; Meso-american and floaty things with a bit more glowy.
---
I agree. Was taking a long break after the Karka invasion event and back a couple months before HoT and i was like "who are these people? And why are we celebrating for in DR bar?"
---
&gt;Is it worth to even consider this game as a person that doesnt have much time to play a day? maybe 2-3 hours every couple of days? is this game friendly with casuals?
---
Yes, very. Even if your focus is completionism, you can get a ton done with just a few hours a day.
---
&gt;Is the community and player base healthy? meaning low areas still have folks around I could do quests with?
---
Yes. Most of the game's content is also easily soloable. Most of the events around the game you can get any stranger to do with you. The hardest part will be finding groups for older dungeons when they aren't dailies, as the more rewarding dungeons are the newer level-80 ones.
---
&gt;Can my Latitude E7470 run the game in low settings?
---
Yes, it should be able to quite well. If it has Windows 10, there is a mod that can speed up the game even further.
---
&gt;Is this a better option than Final Fantasy XIV? I now I'm asking on a GW2 subreddit but I'd assume some of you have play both games? (I only have time for one game in my life atm),
---
Yes; FFXIV has a GCD and a subscription fee.
---
And then not log in again for 6-8 months.
---
Can someone explain what a blocker does?
---
Yes
---
Depends on the configuration of your laptop but it's likely.
---
It's a matter of personal preference and what you want out of this game. I say it's worth investing 24 hours of play time to at least test drive the game before you make any final decision. Even more so I suggest 24 hours of play time after max leveling a character.
---
Some of those harpies in the Pheromone quest in Blazeridge tend to get pretty friendly at times.
---
A bit late, but something is better than nothing. It's good to get some confirmation they've heard at least a few of the complaints and plan to address them.
---
because it comes out tomorrow...
---
I didn't really expect them addressing the monetization scheme, who would expect that really, but I'm still disappointed. The post doesn't talk about the bugs that plague revenant templates and "flexibility" is quite a non-specific term.
---
Oh well
---
Your computer should be fine and this game is literally made for players like you, with not a whole lot of time each day and a lot to do in the 7-year-old world. Download and try, it's free
---
&gt; The post doesn't talk about the bugs that plague revenant templates
---
"And yeah, we'll just leave those bugs as they are!"
---
Come on, bugs are bugs and features are features.
---
Color me impressed, and her I thought we wouldn't even hear about it before December.
---
But there's not even a word on the most pressing need: client-side storage option to the extremely limited 24 server-side slots. Unless "Greater flexibility when making experimental changes to templates" included that.
---
I had over 500 builds saved in GW1, and I was on the lower end of the spectrum. GW2 has less variation in a single build, but it actually has more skills and more possible build combinations because of traits.  
---
24 server-side slots will never be enough for 9 professions.   
---
"Build storage" must have a client-side option just like GW1's only option. It doesn't have to replace the 24 server-side slots that can be bought in the gemstore (specially since there's people who play in Internet Cafes and can't save anything client-side there), but the client-side mode has to co-exist with it as an alternative for those who want to store more than 24 builds in their disk without constantly copypasting them in some text file or using some third party tool.  
---
That's the greater red line I will put in there, and the system shall not get a dime from me without that addition, no matter what else they fix too.
---
I dont think you re right. I think its aflot cuz its still one of the best MMOs with the best combat mechanics (subjektive). Even if they fully fail one feature, here templates, it does in no way change the other things in gw2. Even WvW is badly seen by alot of ppl, but it still makes this game unique. Untill a better MMO gets released GW2 will stay healthy with only a slowly decreasing user count.
---
There is a small body of water in 2 of the borderlands, but it is doubtful you will spend a lot of time there.
---
As it only provides its stats when you take a dip it is absolutly not necessary to grind for a marauder rebreather.
---
He means if you use lege gear for its stat changing property, you miss out on having alternate skins. If you use ascended in each slot, you can have each gear set have a different look. If you use your lege armor in each slot, and just modify the stats, then you only have one look. In a game where the big ticket items are cosmetic, this in effect, makes lege gear less desirable as now youre not saving slots, its not cheaper than buying whatever stat set you want, and youre not getting the extra cosmetic perk.
---
Invulnerability or projectile block/reflect.
---
That's a good point. I really don't feel like I have any agency at times while doing the lws or the expansion stories. The personal story was directed to go a destination but I got to make decisions about the journey. I miss that.
---
Played thru all of BL3, Destiny2, and jus lately new pokemons
---
Maybe it was just somehow related to the abilities of a Chronomancer, since she was a Mesmer and time was a main theme of Utopia:
---
&gt; Both classes tied into some of the themes for Utopia (time, beings lost in the Mists)
---
Bugs happens, fast and often. By over 1.5k Lines Code per Week, Mistakes will happen alot.
---
The update will be in the gemstore
---
Well... yes and no. By logging in on a free account, you'll unlock the episode for a hypothetical future when you have the expac.
---
I'm a noob. What is this referencing and how do I get it?
---
Wasn't expecting them to revisit templates, but I'm glad they proved me wrong.
---
Really want to know more, specially intrigued about the Legendary changes.
---
Exactly.
---
Make lege armor account-wide, unlock it, add it to gear, and it can now be equiped by any char of that armor class, as many characters. You still need like 10 characters/different stat sets for it to even break even with the cost of crafting vs making ascended armor.
---
I'm about to do the same thing lol
---
Guild Banners are crafted at a guild hall with the Scribing crafting skill.  Levelling up Scribing is a very complex procedure compared to other crafting skills, such that as a newer player you really shouldn't worry about it for a long time, if ever.  Whatever guilds you wind up joining should already have dedicated scribes to handle that.  They have occasionally handed out banners via bonus events in the last number of months, so those could prove a way for you to get a hold of some of your own.
---
While banners aren't something you can reasonably craft yourself, joining an established guild can get you access to an XP Booster effect from the guild's tavern, as long as the guild is built up enough, so that's something more reasonable for you to aim for.  Other boosters enhance gathering, reward tracks, and other things, but you can only have one in effect at once.
---
To level fast?  Everything you do gives XP, so go out and do things.  Killing enemies that have been alive for a long time gives bonus XP.  Completing events is generally the best way to progress quickly.
---
Empower should say its range on the tooltip.  How can you tell how big that range is when you use it?  That's a bit trickier, but if you can find a targeted ability with the same range, you can test with that.  If you target an enemy, a red bar appears underneath that ability's button when the target is in range.  Empower would affect that same range, except all around you in a circle.
---
Today's the last to get Bound by Blood Prologue, Living World Season 5. Episode 1 will release tomorrow, and *if* you have Path of Fire expansion, then you can play it tomorrow.
---
Can you get bound by blood prologue for free just by logging in?
---
It really baffles my mind that they probably worked 2 or 3 years? on this and probably still need another year to make everything right and fix all bugs.
---
I have no clue about programming, but why does this take so god damn long to make such a "small" QoL feature.
---
Their priorities getting weirder and weirder each release.
---
Yes but usually 20 min before map closes a squad shows up in LFG for the new meta. This is on EU. Also time of the day can be important.
---
Nice novemeber fools anet...
---
Oh, wait, is this post for real??? Jesus, this stuff is worse than horse armor...
---
I was just making stuff up. The point is Starbound Outfit is pure visual diarrhea.
---
https://i.redd.it/6rqj4gut1eez.png
---
Huh, good point. Maybe it's even a time traveling Gwen who wants to undo the searing or at least restore Ascalon and wants Mordakai on her side, but instead he recruits her to handle whatever's going on. 
---
At any case the possibilities are endless.. would be cool to see an alternate GW universe some day. Something like GW remastered but we continue where we left off.
---
Well i mean some people end up fighting in Bay water and they have the lvl 10 something aqua breather and some blue random lvl 20. If that person run in to the ascended or legendary weapon and breather (ascended) then they will be in disadvantage. Question is how often does this happen. Not that often tbh so up to you to decide what you want to do. 
---
Imo i would at least place a exotic weapon to avoid being ganked under water  they are less then a gold on the trading post. 
---
Aqua breather i dunno what to say about it. I am one of them who have a ascended but i know veterans who still have their lvl 10 ish so i guess it is more about effort or what you like.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Breathing_apparatus
---
This webside tell you were to find or how to make aqua breathers if you want something higher :)
---
It would've been the GW2 we deserved. Not the one we got.
---
I don't think anyone cares much about it being free. The game showers you in transmutation charges in PvP and WvW and even if you only play PvE, you still get a lot of them. Free would be a bonus, one more thing to make legendaries special, but just a bonus.
---
The more important part is being able to swap cosmetics without having to remember and re-select every single skin and dye. Cosmetic templates, perhaps.
---
So, basically, nothing until April and then some minimal changes (cause, you know, progress report in New year is minimum January and then couple more dev months and then a tiny bit of test). Okay then.
---
All I have to say is this:
---
Thank you for the communication, and I will wait for positive results. Arenanet has gotten many things wrong before, then QoLed them to become among the best features in the game after listening to feedback. Oh how soon we forget as soon as it is fixed.
---
When time will WitD be released tomorrow?
---
Getting my WvW slot back is very welcome. This last weeks i don't know how many times i join WvW in full zerker getting one shotted before realizing or joining PvE pulling half the map of mobs and then realize i am full minstrel and the joy of killing veterans and other mobs with litterally no damage. 5 hours later.....
---
When i join WvW i want to have my wvw build and be able to swap in WvW without comming out in PvE with my WvW gear and vice versa.
---
I am so stoked to experience the deep, gnarled forest\~!
---
they also were announced a month before that and most of the issues with their concept were clear as day then already and mentioned plenty of times by the community. the release itself for the most part only revealed the bugs of the system and confirmed many concerns to be true that weren't addressed until then (e.g. game mode auto swapping). so we are actually closer to two months of valid feedback than just under one.
---
Why do people think that storing gear loadouts = appearance loadouts. 
---
Every piece of armor currently has 1 appearance Would you want the game to transmute your armor for you every time you switched? 
---
That would burn up all of the transmutation charges you have currently in no time.
---
That is good to know. It certainly paints a clearer picture of what Jormag since we know who it is being said to. And what you said makes sense, they did say they were taking inspiration from cthulhu and having people spiral into madness makes sense.
---
One of the few things that are actually worth it.
---
&gt; A bit late
---
Build Templates are only 3 weeks old, but okay...
---
yeah, but electric wyvern is a pet, not a mount
---
yeah, no. the issues with their concept were pretty damn obvious the second we got some info on it. someone even made a comparison sheet long before the release. sure, as always there was a lot of side rants going on, people proudly boasting that they see no issue and there can't possibly any downside, or that people just misunderstood the announcement, but the moment people got as much as a sniff that the system would consist of loadouts instead of templates concerns and feedback were voiced.
---
in case of a class rework you would be absolutely right. there are a lot of interactions to consider and a lot of info simply can not be contained in a blogpost. this however is very basic and simple concept in comparison. it's two panels worth of UI modification. *and* we had something to compare it to.
---
you don't need hands-on experience to come to the conclusion that someone looking for a bicycle isn't going to be satisfied with a construct that has its two wheels aligned side by side.
---
I mean they could just refund the gems right? It's not really an excuse.
---
I want to see an aztec expansion, with maybe some hints of Mexico.
---
My only guess is that it's related to the way they move or sync data between megaservers and/or the client. They may have an infrastructure that speeds up data transfer and is hard to change what data is sent.
---
&gt; so... we won't even get a status update on just the few changes they do until next year, let alone actually changes ... 
---
"Just a few changes" lmao. Read again.
---
So if you say not many, then drop the pay thing, you are telling us a game does combat right, the only one I can even think of is BDO.
---
What "not many" games are you referring to then?
---
I can't comment on the tech so I'll leave that for someone else but I can say that it sounds like you have commitments that take up your time and it takes you some time to save. GW2 is more casual friendly than FFXIV and doesn't have a subscription fee so it sounds like it would be better for you long term. You can drop it and pick it up again very easily compared to other MMOs. You can also try the free trial account and play all the way to max level before deciding to purchase. That said, there are deals right now for cheaper living world episodes and expansions so it's a good time to join. Also if you buy path of fire expansion you'll get heart of thorns and the base game already included.
---
Good start. 
---
Still think theyre way too harshly monetized. 
---
ImO, Change Account-Bound Slots into "Inactive Build Slots" and make them Character-Bound (and free as theyre literally worth a chatcode).   
---
Then rename the currently Char-Bound Slots to "Active Build Slots", sell those two account-bound - one of each in a package.   
---
Bonus Points for enabling linking gear and active Slots. 
---
I'd happily pay for them that way - a higher price, even! 
---
Right now i see no incentive to actually invest Money or even gems, especially since theyre character-bound.
---
And the best introduced and defeated with actual build up even if the actual encounter was cake . In contrast we’ve just killed all other threats whether they be elder dragons or others with several ass-pulls
---
Read it multiple times, still just a few changes.
---
So? Just because you asked your friend doesn't mean it will magically become available to gift do them. How would Anet know you had that conversation? The point still stands that accou t upgrades can't be gifted because it's more hassle than its worth for Anet. This is the dumbest thing I've read in a while.
---
This is speculation based on a few datamined files and has never actually been confirmed. Those files could have been for other things such as another Dungeon path or anything really. Is it likely? Maybe, is it fact as you have presented it? Far from it.
---
&gt; It really baffles my mind that they worked 2 or 3 years? on this and probably still need another year to make everything right and fix all bugs.
---
Holy cow, who fooled you by saying they worked 2-3 years on build templates? Lol. 
---
And what the hell are you reading about "need another year to fix bugs"? They literally said "early next year" plus we all know that this year is over in like 3 weeks, because Winter Holidays. They just said "it won't be finished in the next the weeks" and *not* "next year". 
---
&gt; I have no clue about programming, but why does this take so god damn long to make such a "small" QoL feature.
---
Easy answer -&gt; 
---
&gt; I have no clue about programming
---
Sorry this question thread is anwsered by players, not Anet devs. Many here share your frustration about the current state of PvP, but there isn't much we can do for you. :(
---
&gt;Gemstore skins and outfits are more and more ridiculous/overdone.
---
I actually think this looks more fitting than the original "cute" Springer...
---
Maybe turn down the particle effects.
---
The model/design itself is cool though.
---
&gt; but who the hell care about auto switching, you can do it with 1 key... 
---
People who play PvE while waiting for PvP matchup. In PvE you wan to play with your PvP builds obviously, but in a PvP match you can't change your build.
---
3 weeks is ok for an update on what they intend to do to address the problem. But they should have given more communication in the meantime to set expectations about when we could have expected this particular update.
---
So about 6 months for anything, true GW2 fashion :)
---
they put themselves doubly positioned themselves into a corner because they release an already heavily criticised system and *immediately* put out purchase options for it. and because people now bought into that stupid system they have to be careful about what and how they change it.
---
and that's what is so frustrating to me. this is a 15 or whatever years old company and they still frequently trip over their own feet in ways that would be comical or even hilarious if it wasn't so sad.
---
&gt; they'd have just a progress update next year.
---
Just like they did with alliances... Over 2 years later, still no sign of anything.
---
not really... its mostly that that no one is doing new major MMOs anymore with how easy it is to milk players with mobile games now....
---
The economy would collapse if they gave the mystic forge recipe lists.
---
time to get 2k gems. now downvote me. thats all this salty shithole of a reddit knows how to do
---
By logging in while they're active, you can unlock story chapters on your account for free (without having to pay for them). It's just that you can't actually play them until you have the corresponding xpac.
---
&gt; Ease of swapping legendary equipment between characters.
---
...but she didn't address anything regarding the ease of swapping legendary equipment between tabs and in a single character...because the primary issue is legendary swapping in a given tab (especially if it's used on other tabs), weapons most notably since those are swapped often, causes all upgrades to be un-equipped.
---
Wait... Leg armor isn't *supposed* to be cost effective? Gasp! It's also a prestige item, not just expensive QoL?!?!
---
But it would be less pretty and there would only be one gamemode.
---
I’ve always like this. As good as it was however, if it wasn’t for Guild Wars 2 being worked on at that time, I might have never heard of it or ever played. I know for me and a few others, GW2 came out at the perfect time. I never played GW1 when it was the thing, only until after about 2 years ago.
---
&gt; 😉
---
😉
---
&gt; And for the auto swapping part if you join WvW or PvP ... it is nice that we get auto swapping for WvW, but this actually existed in the game already since the very start, before they forced their "templates" to us ..
---
just a small correction. this has only been in the game for... idk, maybe 2 years and was a rather well received change. it not being all that old already makes it seem quite odd that it just got removed and forgotten about again, but i also remember a comment that back then claimed it was loosely tied to a *potential* template system that may or may not have been worked on as a side project that nobody should hold their breath for.
---
Yeah, it will take what feels like an eternity to make the system feel good. A system they charge you for.
---
Bump for RnT!  Condi squad represent! :)
---
Nice content lul. Definitely not income driven *\*coughs\**
---
&gt; Someone at anet should tell ncsoft and their investors because according to their conference call notes they look at expansions as cost beneficial. 
---
As of when did they say that? Was it in 2019, or at some earlier date? If it was earlier, perhaps that was their opinion at the time, but they have since taken in new data and changed their mind for some reason.
---
&gt;FWIW from what I understand anet does get better roi from expansions and the choice not to do an expansion cycle after pof had more to do with resources being allocated to other projects besides gw2
---
Source?
