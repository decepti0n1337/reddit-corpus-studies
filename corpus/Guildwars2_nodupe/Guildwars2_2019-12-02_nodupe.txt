Honestly I do enjoy watching real raid squads doing raids or someone cheesing fractals and speedrunning, but when u get to casual level, theres 80% downtime on every boss where people prepare + wipes. thats no fun.
---
---
---
What am incredibly pointless remark for something nobody has hard data on.
---
I don’t know as I stopped playing. The community always expected GW2 to really blossom from its release onward.  
---

---
Sometimes it did, with good quality of life changes and the addition of raids and certain fractals as well as HoT meta events.  
---
But, the game is 7 years old now and it seems the focus isn’t on improving and expanding upon the multiplayer content that actually shapes this community, meaning WvW, PvP, Raids, Fractals and Dungeons.  
---
From a new players perspective what matters is if that community is active enough to enjoy those modes (in my opinion). I don’t know if they are, but they are certainly well out of their prime because of a lack of constant content additions.  
---
Lastly, GW2 will never become the game that a lot of people hoped it would become, so don’t get your hopes up. In my opinion the game has come to its end already. That is unless you enjoy the open world content and Living Story, but to me the open world is mind numbingly boring and the Living Story is just not amazing but worth logging in and back out for.
---
Instead of just accepting it, you want to see why is that.
---
Gw2 is beautiful game but theres not tjust a lot of content to stream apart from PvP which stays stagnant over the years AND Arenanet doesnt even do advertising for it or giveaways at least to draw in more viewers.
---
People have all the rights to talk about flaws of the game they love. Its only good for new players to know what's up before investing thousands of hours into a game that might not be there in couple years. You can only blame Arenanet on this one.
---
I've never **ever** dropped a shimmering/tenebrous crystal in Windswept Haven. Its rare drop seems to be Obsidian Shards instead.
---
Not being on twitch is not necessarily indicative on in decline, and no one wants to hear that. This game has always sucked to watch. Too much visual spam on skills, for example. It's probably in decline for the hardest core players though.
---
What resolution is that? Looks like a background scaling issue. [Normally](https://ctrlaltrepeated.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/guild-wars-2-cutscene.jpg) the darker bar above the painted background serves as the dialogue background.
---
My friend who plays on 4k complains of the same issue, I didnt even think of my resolution.  Its 5120x1440 I also cant see character heads either most of the time :(.
---
First of all GW2 doesn’t make good use of threads so you need a lot of ghz on your CPU to make this thing run proper and even then there are areas where the frames will drop.  
---
Laptops are infamous for not being great with this game as their CPUs will often just get too hot. I’ve heard stories though where peoples fans were simply filled with dust and had to be cleaned out, maybe try that.  
---
Other tip is to set Character Model Limit to lowest or low. That’s the amount of other players that will be rendered around you, it eats a lot of performance if that’s high. You might have to set this to Medium though for certain raid encounters since some mechanics are bound to this setting too.
---
I have tried both PvP and WvW but anything competitive isn't really my thing in general.
---
Which just furthers my point even more.  The idea that "GW2 isn't a good stream game" isn't really an issue at all.  What is an issue is lack of 1) Hyped new content (Expansions, tournaments, etc.) regularly and then 2) lack of (many) popular or exciting streamers.  Big events like the ERP that drew in so many people show that the game can really do decently on Twitch, it just requires more things to hype it up and more people to engage with the community.  Ofc this may be too little too late at this point 7 years into the games life and ultimately has to be helped by Arenanet with strong releases, not just constant living story updates
---
my feet are spastic. my wrists are not steady. my fingers and elbow in my left arm and hand are ok. i play without a mouse. my keyboard is my main playing instrument/device.
---
Yeah it's probably that, I play at 1680x1050 (old monitor) and there's no issue. Large resolutions don't seem to scale properly.
---
The last champion of the elder dragon have revealed itself.
---
Wouldn't a mmo mouse help a lot? You can bind autorun, special action key, dodge, and heal to the mouse and then skill click the rest. Sure, it's not as precise as wasd but it's a lot better than playing with a normal mouse.
---
Guildie of mine is limited to one hand like you, I have no idea how but shes one of the best players I've met, she does raids (various roles) fractal CMs and basically all the hard content. I believe she has a 12 button mouse
---
Or just move around watching netflix
---
Love it! Keep up the good work :)
---
play the game without a mouse and use your thumb and pointer fingers to experience what i do.
---
Most are bots. Ppl who take is seriously are not In bronze
---
&gt; Everyone who enjoys the game is too busy playing it to bother getting on reddit to bitch about it. 
---
This argument needs to go away. It's a complete fallacy. For almost the entire lifetime of GW2 this sub has been overwhelmingly positive about the game and Arenanet. Anyone who criticised the game in any way got shat on by toxic white knights and only recently has the general opinion swung in the other direction which is extremely closely tied to the direction and future of the game lately.
---
You should give it a try tbh. The game can be a bit grindy for sure and the controls, graphics and combat may seem a bit simplistic but it's one of the best and most rewarding pve experiences I've ever played. The skilling and quest systems are both amazing with how they interact with each other and gameplay in general. I've never had nearly as much satisfaction from anything pve related in gw2 as I have in osrs whether it was maxing out my first skill to 99 and getting the 99 Cape, or killing TzTok-Jad for the first time and getting my first fire Cape, or killing a gwd boss for the first time its incredibly satisfying to reach a goal and have all your hard work skilling and questing pay off with not only something shiny and new but something that will aid you going forward in whatever you're progressing towards next.
---
Then my idea isn't as good as I thought. :(
---
I run the meta power reaper build in solo open world and I do just fine. However, I've also been playing the game (and reaper) for a long time, and if OP is more new then maybe they'll prefer taking death magic instead. I think it's fair to explain why soul reaping is better/meta, but also say "yeah, obviously you can take death magic instead if you want", because it's just open world lol, and op should play what he enjoys. 
---
If you don't like the vuln, speed of shadows is an *excellent* alternative (and what I sometimes take for PoF, because I feel like those mobs apply an inordinate amount of soft cc skills). If you're thinking 'meta' enough to be considering how much vuln someone else will apply, you're not going to be taking death magic anyway, unless you're trying to play the tank. 
---
Also, you probably wouldn't take power reaper to a world record, but for raids/fractals (and cms for either) it's completely fine - I rarely feel like I'm getting dabbed on hard by another dps class. The benchmark needs to be higher though tbh, it's frustrating being kept at 30-31k for so long.
---
i dunno about that,teapot didnt get anything from anet and he had 30k gold in rewards and there are probably few streamers which do it just for fun,like sindererr and few other pvp figures. than you have cringe streamers like aurora peachy,which literaly just licking anet balls for years and i wonder how much shes getting paid.
---
Trading post. Look up "named armor" on the wiki, that's usually cheap.
---
If both a hardcore dude and a game jumper/casual can't stay in your game, no one can. 
---
You are describing the only 2 types of players for any game out there, either the casual or the hardcore gamer.
---
Banning kripp is bad marketing, you shouldn't ban people based on an "exploit" in your own vendor. Look at how valve handles this type of "exploit"
---
https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team-fortress-2-unusual-crate-bug-depression-resolved
---
"If you deleted your unusual hats from bugged crates, Valve is returning them to your inventory with the same rules applied to the above." players were too scared to lose their steam account that they deleted the "exploited" items AND VALVE RETURNS THOSE deleted items back to them.
---
Furthermore, an exploit on rank mode + streaming/advertising it only gets you a 3 days ban for blizzard case. https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/06/zero-to-legend-hearthstone-player-banned-for-using-free-win-priest-exploit/
---
It is just bad marketing to players since by permanently banning players for "exploiting", you are telling them they don't have freedom of choice in any matter in the game and everything is up to the discretion of the company.
---
Personally I go with Spite + Blood Magic for open world reasons (supplying my own might, life steal, more life steal with wells, group revives, one-touch revives without having to sit there, bonus damage against half-health-or-lower foes). If I used Reaper in T4 Fractals, I'd be using that too (random pugging, can't rely on having a healer).
---
Any organized PvE with a healer, though (Raids, Fractal CMs), you want to go Spite + Soul Reaping, as the survivability from Blood Magic becomes no longer needed.
---
I really can't recommend taking Death Magic over either of those two, and Spite has too much good synergy with Reaper to replace with anything else.
---
AP / fun
---
Yes, did it for Quip III last month.
---
I don't think it's an excuse, and FFXIV is actually very low compared to the playerbase for the exact same reason, it's not interesting to watch outside world first raid races.
---
I'd go further ahead and ask, what exactly is so interesting about watching streams? Why not just play the game yourself?
---

It's not a perfect solution, but look into using VoiceBot to be able to say commands. My mother is legally blind and also has extremely limited use of her hands and thumbs, but I was able to help her get set up to say commands to use skills and abilities, and work the menus, etc.
---
If you need help with it, please let me know and I could try my best to give you some tips on how to set up the different commands.

Thank you for your answer, it's very informative.
---
My English is pretty rusty, I guess I worded my question poorly - I certainly didn't mean to imply that visitors have a right to expect specific nodes in a home instance.
---
What I wanted to know is what the community means when using the term "full home instance". 
---
The thing with the garden is what I'm most interested in - is it usually included when someone offers a full instance and what crops are used? 
---
Or does it vary and some people offer their garden and some don't when using the term "full"? 
---
Should it be mentioned that the garden is not available for visitors?
---
I know that people can only use the treasure chest when they earned it themselves, what I don't know is whether they can open it in a home instance where the owner hasn't unlocked it.
---
People that spent the amount of gold needed to unlock it probably have their own full home instance and this is not really relevant, it's just curiosity.
---
I get gold every single day by playing quickness healbrand, no matter how good or bad the players are. Squad mode only. There are always one or to players who play ineffectivly with 2k dps and it's still always gold. Preventing cc and downstates while buffing them is enough.
---
I wasnt judging. I was just handing you options which you did not like about. You really dont have any right to complain about not being able to get transmutation charges if u arent willing to play or pay for them.

Can the Xbox Adaptive Controller be hooked up to GW2?

At what point can you leave and still get the loot sent to you?

Name me one big name streamer that isn't geared toward high replayability hardcore content.

&amp;#x200B;
---
How do you think WoW would stay afloat if it only released normal mode raids?
---
I don’t understand your point, if you have one.
---
There’s another poster here who said he’s in plat and bots seldom show up, but they still do.
---
Bots are not fun to play against nor are they fun to have in your team. Just because YOU don’t care about PvP doesn’t mean other people can’t.
---
I dunno, maybe I'm an asshole, but if there is a physical limitation (not of your doing, obviously) that requires someone to come play the game for you then why bother playing the game at all?  Sounds like a lot of trouble for something that you might not be able to get full enjoyment out of.   The thing is the game was designed for two-handed actions (as is apparent by your inability to progress with a single hand) so why shove a square peg in a round hole?  Maybe you can try a point-and-click MMO like Ragnarok Online or something?  (Maybe there are better point-and-click games out there but that's all I can recall from college days.)
---
Good luck to you.  Hopefully you find something that works.
---
And even when you want a hard carry healer that doesn't do any boons, scrapper is outclassed by scourge and tempest.
---
PvP is challenging but as I said that's not the reason I don't like it. It just isn't the kind of game mode I enjoy. You're just jumping into wrong conclusions. And you can go away with that "toxic" crap, that word has lost its meaning a long ago.
---
&gt;Or does it vary and some people offer their garden and some don't when using the term "full"? 
---
yeah, it varies. you're fine saying 'full home instance' while using your gardens for personal ascended seeds
---
&gt;I know that people can only use the treasure chest when they earned it themselves, what I don't know is whether they can open it in a home instance where the owner hasn't unlocked it.
---
 
---
they can't.
---
you can't buy crowbars. for whatever reason it's the one HoT map-specific key that isn't available to purchase.
---
So you just enjoy instant gratification and dont like to put any brainwork into rewards and think that you deserve everything just handed to you?  
---
I really dont understand your mindset. Just suck it up that you cant get transmutation charges unless you leave your comfort zone and work for it a bit. Even map completion hands them to you. Grind that at least if you refuse to do better methods.
---
"Everything to me now right now" attitude has ruined gaming industry and you seem to be part of that gang.
---
Basically just the vendor trash bag and hoping it gives you something that's wanted on the TP. I don't think any of the crafting recipes makes anything wanted by the meta fanatics so that's out.
---
Crowbars only drop from doing events IIRC.
---
following
---
Maybe you need the mastery for it. I am not sure since I've had it for a while. By chests I mean a coffer with whatever rewards you would've earned.
---
I used to have no problems for most of GW2 and then developed some very serious one that really limit my skill and ability.  I love WvW and roaming, but these days, I can't play for long.  Meaning if I run into a highly skilled player where our fight is going to take a long time, I leave.  
---
After a couple of minutes, this becomes obvious to me and I end up leaving the fight.  Of course, to the other person, this gives them the wrong impression and I could worry about that.  Think oh this person is going to think they're the better player skill wise and that I am running scared where for me I know that while I will likely win the fight, it's cost to me is that I will have to end my gameplay much earlier than if I did less taxing stuff. 
---
But that's the thing, this is some random person you are likely never going to meet in rl or even their real name or anything about them.  Why risk health and enjoyment over worrying about what others who don't matter think?
---
Don't worry what others think.  Play the game how you can if it means fun to you and don't worry if they think less of you when they don't even know what you are dealing with.  
---
And personally (and I don't think I am alone in saying this), I LOVE helping people in real life and GW2 and well everywhere.  But I am also conscious about not helping without being invited because I might not be appreciated.  For example, there are certain champions and challenges that I've always enjoy doing solo.  It's a test of my abilities and I love it and when others join, it defeats what I was trying to do.  
---
Sometimes, for example, I create a new build and take it a relatively challenging boss as part of my way of evaluating it to compare.  And these days, I have to take great care in not taxing myself too much due to my physical problems so I need to get inventive. 
---
Because of this, I also respect others when I see them soloing something.  Most times I don't interfere and once in a while I join but only asking if it's okay to do so, even though I know most in GW2 open world welcome help.
---
But when I actually know someone needs help?  I LOVE it!!!  I've gone past people soloing who ask for help or who are dying.  I jump off, revive them, and help them and while they're grateful, I am more so for providing help and joy to someone else.
---
In the past (when my hands were better), I've gone hours helping new players.  Once I creeped out a new player who was in too hard an area by following them and keeping them alive while not getting involved in their fights directly so they could still have fun.  That player was convinced I was part of the system that GW2 provided a helper character to new players.  When he/she realized I was a real person, I think they were a bit freaked out.
---
Thing is, I am not alone in loving to help others IF we know someone needs/wants us.  When someone calls out on map chat for help with something and if I can help them, I do most times.  In fact, the times I don't is because I know there is no point.  I know others will hear the map chat and go help too so I am no longer needed.
---
Need help with the story?  I'd love to and others would too.  Just because many of us just love to help.  I don't think we're rare in GW2.  But, in my case, I do need explicitly to know it's help.  If I hear someone in map chat ask if anyone wants to do something, I don't respond.  But if the same person asked for help explicitly, then that changes things.  
---
And if you have actual issues like physical challenges, I think it's good to share that too because it means even more people will respond.  A lot of us love to make a difference both in the real world and virtual worlds.  And all we need, if anything, from it is usually just appreciation and kindness back. 
---
Don't lose faith in the playerbase, the ones in the actual game.  
---
And, if you don't take offense, I'd like to give you a quick hug.  *hug*  That's because I've been there and know how hard it can be to play what you love with physical limiations.  Mine can vary but when it's severe, I can't type, I can't play GW2 at all, work...and am limited to TV and if I am lucky, playing another game with a specialized controller and where I can work around with it.  I'd play GW2 much more if I could.  So *hug* it can be really hard physically and more...and sometimes...well just know you are not alone.
---
Definitely not something new. Was in an lfg squad group and we had 2 druids I'm thinking alright, we may not get gold but at least we'll stay alive. 
---
I was so wrong. We wiped after 5 minutes, both druids were useless. Left squad asap, as soon as we respawned hit "leave squad" and it popped me out in Bjora, with two mails in my inbox. One with silver rewards, one with base.
---
What? This cannot stand! Head to the first WP in Queensdale. Say your situation you'll be swamped with help. Daily Jump Puzzles would also be a good place. Lots of people just hang and chat while out porting the JP. They'd love to lend a hand.
---
The ones on the TP are produced by *someone* playing Sandstorm.
---
Yep, I did say condi base warrior in the post.
---
Fully half the squad in my Fraenir strike today was doing less dps than me on support chrono, and I don't even optimize for damage. I'm running full Diviner gear to max out my boon duration, so getting beaten by me is truly shameful.
---
That episode is officially my favorite episode. Ever.
---
Yeah for the current Fraenir strike, condi quickbrand is a true hard carry. You do incredible dps, provide quickness and aegis, and get a free reflect in your f3 tome to negate the splash damage projectiles that are the most frequent cause of wipes.
---
Nah I loved that ending and I loved the episode afterwards. Both episodes were amazing imo
---
do actual raids then?  IIRC strike missions are for casual pugs and introductions to raids,  no need to be a dickhole about it. If people want to try hard then join those people? if they dont know the mechanics then dont play with them
---
seconded. have seen a lot of stuff, including max range LB base rangers, power scourges, multiboxers with 4 engis that tried to leach and got cocky.
---
for today's run i had a healbrand, alacrigade and me on DH, LFGing for *good* DPS. long story short: the alacrigade did ~ half my DPS, everyone else was easily below that, with the lowest struggling to keep ahead of the healbrand. i was seriously surprised when we still managed to get gold with ~5s to spare.
---
naturally one ~~toxic casual~~ rando dude had the nerve to blame the fact that everyone was in the same sub-group... while doing less than half my damage.
---
pugging bjora strikes leads to some of the wildest experiences.
---
&gt;i cannot do 2 handed required actions
---
Would a gaming mouse help?
---
How will this be an introduction to raids if they're not criticized for playing poorly? This game doesn't have a DPS meter built-in, other players live in a bubble, they cannot know how well they are doing compared to others. A player who never watched videos of others playing the game would think that their 200 damage autoattack is a great number. Because its just a number in a vacuum, they have nothing to compare it against! So they'll just keep playing in their toughness-vitality-healing gear, thinking they're doing just fine and everybody else is just like them, being gleefully unaware how bad they are unless someone points that out to them. A no, not everyone is supposed to have a degree in psychology and a patience of a babysitter to treat such people like tender snowflakes to not upset them or make them feel bad about themselves.
---
What is botomline?
---
Beautiful!
---
For open world solo play, Reaper + Soul Reaping + Death Magic works really well.  Death Magic + Soul Reaping increase your Life Force generation and reduces your damage taken, increasing Reaper Shroud uptime.  Because you dropped Spite, most of your damage comes from Reaper Shroud, so having higher uptime compensates for the loss of Spite.
---
You're also impervious to conditions, since each minion transfers one of your conditions to its target every 10s.  With 4+ minions you're streaming your conditions back to the enemy.
---
High toughness, zero-cooldown constant condi clear, increased Life Force gen, higher Reaper Shroud uptime.  It's a beast, probably the strongest build for solo play.
---
That said, in group content like Fractals or Raids, stick with Reaper + Soul Reaping + Spite.  Your teammates will condi clear and provide increased defense (Aegis, Protection, etc).  Don't need Death Magic in group content.
---
This could be read as a compliment or a simple assertion of fact.
---
One reason for this is that OSRS is a game that allows livestreamers to consistently interact with their viewers. Another reason is that OSRS has a lot of activities that allows the player to play it while doing something else, for example watch livestreams. You can see how these things complement each other greatly.
---
Naturally OSRS' playercount is also a reason for how the high view counts as its currently got 81k players online playing.
---
Have you looked into https://ablegamers.org/ ?
---
So far I'm finding the Strikes not only ridiculously easy but incredibly pointless. I can think of many an open world encounter that is much more difficult. The 4 Djinn champs fight in the Hanging Gardens in Vabbi, the Specimen Chamber in Sandswept, the drunken pirate boss fight in Istan and several of the open world bounties off the top of my head.
---
I don't get why they create these new properties only for them to be underwhelming or abandoned. Wouldn;t it have made more sense for the effort that went into strike missions to have gone into fractals, raids or heck, even some new guild missions?
---
Everyone claims their opinion represents the oppressed minority these days. Everyone wants to be the scrappy underdog fighting against the big bad. Captain Sisko said it best when he said "Everyone loves a lost cause."
---
We can't even get hard data anymore because of data manipulation. Everything is a conspiracy and it's become a Baskin Robbins of narratives. This isn't limited to this subreddit or GW2 or even gaming. Societially speaking our information is in a constant state of flux. So I ask how you are sure of anything and how you aren't being manipulated right now.
---
Dodge into the wall, instead of off the ledge.  You don't have to cover distance when you dodge to still get the evade frames.
---
Those kind of arguments seriously are the worst. They're dismissive and make the assumption that if you criticize something you don't enjoy said something with the added pretense that you're just being irrational and not worth listening to. Awfully rude and flawed way to brush people's feelings aside.
---
Right? Also, some of us are fashionistas, so...the more of these, the better.
---
read OP again. I think you missed something.
---
This behaviour should be reportable. I guess LFG system abuse?
---
The only toxic person in this thread is you buddy. Try not being a condescending a-hat? Just a thought.
---
There should be weekly or even montly limit on how often system can sent rewards to player. Otherwise some people will abuse it (101 why we cant have nice things).
---
Not judging your binds here btw but just more of a PSA for anyone reading this: you can use Shift/Ctrl/Alt as actual binds for stuff. I've got Shift bound to my weapon swap and used to have my Dodge bound to that so I could Dodge in every direction with ease (currently got it bound to X which I press with my thumb).
---
The two mount abilities can also share binds with non-mount abilities. I've got Mount Ability 1 bound to Shift (same as weapon swap) and Mount Ability 2 bound to 3 (weapon ability). So if you wanted you can use R and T for both mount and non-mount abilities.
---
Btw if you haven't already, GW2radial is worth looking into. It's an addon for mounts that pops up a radial menu on the screen with the hold of a button (Alt for example) and allows you to select the mount you want to hop onto with the flick of your mouse. For example when I hold down Alt and flick upwards with my mouse, I mount up on my Springer. Hold Alt and flick down, and I mount up on my Skimmer. Really handy.
---
Yeah, with AHK you can bind pretty much anything to any given controller
---
Yeah, it's nuts. I did one on my support Chrono and had four of the dps (and rightfully, the healer) below me. I've (politely) dragged a couple of guildies into the Special Forces Training area after strikes too.
---
I'm firmly convinced that everything that makes this story so engaging to Anet is sitting in a desk drawer somewhere.  Like the writers don't actually play the release product and are talking about the script they sent to production.  They do a few things well and a few more adequately, but... I definitely haven't put as much time into the game as I have because of the story.
---
no. my wrists are unsteady with random, snaky movements. i can only play with keyboard with my thumb and pointer fingers.
---
It's not a bitch and moan post about not getting gold?
---
Hm, I wonder if one could use controller designed, or atleast compatible with legs to overcome this condition.
---
UPD: Ah, I see people suggested it already. Hm, well, advanced MMO mouse maybe? Voice control or even webcam with gesture recognition? Not like I know about it alot, but its all I have right now in mind.
---
Main reason I quit daily t4 fractals. Even with the required agony resistance and having to work way up to t4s, the average player was very poor DPS. I often came in as 2nd highest DPS when playing a pure support roll even when being selective about which group I joined. 
---
In strike missions anyone can join so it’s even worse. This game is very unkind to any non casual players. It is very frustrating.
---
no. this is the first time i have saw this website however, this will more options if you really quit gw2.
---
Hakuna Matata
---
It ends up being, what, a loss of \~20g per AP for the collection? Feelsbadman.
---
Ok boomer.
---
ah gotcha gotcha
---
That's too bad. Wish I had some useful advice beyond telling players who give shit about to go fuck themselves.
---
Yes.
---
Im on EU and doing the strikemissions daily. Sure theres here and there some players doing poor dmg, but at least \~5 players in my squad do decent to good dps, so it doesnt matter.
---
I tend to give tips before starting, like with last weeks bjora strike, Id tell people to stay in mid and dont overlap red circles &lt; 50%.
---
Overall, Im pleasantly surprised, because people definitely are more ambitious in strikes. Its a good start to get more people interested in playing the game well.
---
I have hundreds of them in my own guild hall, made a nice jumping puzzle stairway from them :DD
---
can be seen at the end of the video, but just a part of it .D  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHlO0j2h7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHlO0j2h7M)
---
Hmm i joined rando lfgs after the metas for both missions today and got gold on both...  lucky??
---
Some content may seems dead, but overall population is one of the biggest in mmorpg genre, we don’t have exact numbers but it should be close to eso
---
Especially Deimos. That one is… interesting.
---
This will sadly never change unless Anet decides to balance and design classes around actual roles. Why make new specs that can take the "role" of a chrono if you can be Anet and split it into two new specs? Even if it was perfectly balanced it would still be very PUG-unfriendly. And the less players there are the less varied groups there will be and the more you are "forced" to follow a certain meta.
---
Im pretty sure its a bug that will be fixed this or next week.
---
Even dungeons (the most dead content in the game) have people doing them if you look for them.

The thing that makes the open world feel a little dead sometimes is the sharding, which is very similar to what happens in WoW, so it's not a big deal. You also get a prompt when you're playing in a shard with too few players, so you get to transfer to a more populated shard and they get to shut down the empty one.

Ff14 has way more variety of content, as well as more and highly replayable. It has way more dungeons, than gw2 dungeons and fractals combined while having different difficulties. The same is true about raids. More pvp modes, even if its pvp is not that good, alliances pvp is super fun. It also has surprisingly deep mini games, something that i liked initially in gw2. Gw2 has at times, more polish but they focus on dumb things instead of pushing to high replayability and rewards in long term investment, something that BDO excels at, even if it lacks in typical content.
---
In point 1, they did push in twitch exposure in the beginning, with weekly tournaments, and inside look at pvp mechanics with grouch, but they were quick to slowly halt this, and were never aware of supporting streamers that were streaming their game. It was clearly mismanagement from their part.
---
I agree with point 2. They pushed raids without providing a learning curve to casual players for them to actually learn the intricacy of the combat. People dont know about field combos, all they do is let auto attack do its thing in open world. The new strikes or mini raids, dont know their name, provide nothing that actually teach these players about this again because again, there is actually no risk.
---
Overall gw2 lacks long term rewards and highly replayable content. What is there to obtain in the game? The cool stuff is obtained from gem store, so there is no progressuon at all... What would be the point of even streaming this game? To stream it for 2 hours ever 3 months for the story? Not worth it.
---
Gw2 had no focus in its vision, even if lot of us saw how big the potential there was. All because of the poor mismanagement. It is too late now to do a turnover.
---
First true-fullscreen gamma correction can be wrong. So if you use true-fullscreen better to switch on windowed fullscreen.
---
Second is some non-precise sRGB shader code and faulty low gfx settings related shaders. Fix to this part is in progress.
---
Taimi is my best character, im sad she’s not in ls5
---
Braham in ls3 was cancer, in ls4 he was fine but now again i feel like he’s kid
---
It's a great opportunity to meet new friends.
---
When do I use FB runes?
---
This was a triumph. 
---
I‘m making a note here: huge success.
---
one whoud say,that kind of information whoud be usefull BEFORE you start download XD
---
Glint Jalis is good for PvP/WvW
---
Glint Ventari is...bad. You're still taking S/S Staff, but now you gotta get Harriers/Magi, and half the time you literally have no heal spells. I still like it because you can vomit out boons even outside of Glint, but 50% heal uptime is just not enough.
---
The fact of the matter is, Herald is a boonshare tank, in a game where tanks are bad. So you slot in all your boons and everything else is DPS. Renegade has some interesting Condi builds, though.
---
If you sneeze in VB you'll get a crowbar.  At this point I don't think I'll ever be able to open enough airship cargos to use them all.
---
Oh its just slightly annoying for me because some missions my friend would be faster or I would be faster. And idk what you mean by dragon stand.
---
&gt; game design promotes cooperation
---
to bad this isn't a thing anymore shortly after HoT times
---
I don't think it's the signet, it's the tactics trait line, soldier's focus I think it is.
---
People can't read minds, if tell people you have a real life issue and need help, someone will help you.  You can't expect them to know what you're dealing with if you don't tell them.
---
Is there any chance of rewards being buffed in some way because the rewards on these are worse than the strike mission in Grothmar.
---
You can sell them back
---
I never understood quitting a game over something like this, since this type of thing can happen in virtually any game. If you do something like that here, what's to say you won't do something like that somewhere else?
---
Just sell them back and take the hit on them.
---
You can do dungeons ( even tho they are not officially supported anymore they are a lot of fun especially if you run with friends )
---
Do fracs , try raids ...
---
Do pvp together ( daily at maybe ) 
---
Join a wvw battle
---
Isn't gold just one rare? If you kill boss no matter of time you can loot 2 chests, if you don't loot them they will send them as mail.
---
Gold rewards are just one rare bag and it is not daily capped so you get it every time.
---
I just finished the personal story arc and it's now begun Scarlet's War for me. I don't mind the story stuff but can take or leave it unless there are some good/necessary gear rewards. 
---
Right now I am on the base account (purchased on release) and have one character up to level 80. Now keen to do some of the expansion stuff and get access to Revenant class, mounts, etc. 
---
So is there any point doing Scarlet's War and all the Living World episodes other than just the story? Or should I just jump into the 2 main expansions and play them to get access to all the other things?
---
Even though the impact of All or Nothing is squandered in the very next episode, I would still call it the absolute high-point in the GW2 story, and an example of the gravity with which an elder dragon should be treated.
---
The thing that really brings it home is the former enemies joining you out of desperation (the flame legion chef and the dredge) and a small side dialogue with a Pact soldier talking to an Awakened about dying. I mean, besides the insanely good chorus phases that kick in when you channel against Kralkatorrik. The whole fight is pure hype, and it genuinely feels like the end of the world.
---
In isolation, the next episode isn't bad. It completely compromises the emotional impact of All or Nothing, but it was still a good episode. You could make a very good case that Dragonfall is the best map in GW2: there are no hearts, it incorporates almost every mobility mastery, and the meta is entirely player-driven rather than being on a timer (which is also why people still like Silverwastes). Plus the fact that it's literally set on top of Kralkatorrik and chunks of the god realms is bonkers and makes the map visually striking.
---
If your left hand and arm is steadier, would something like this be of any help?
---
https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-orbweaver-chroma
---
There are things like that from other brands as well, probably at a lower price
---
Reminds me of when I tried to play World of Warcraft.
---
I was making my first character and I must have misclicked because I accidentally created an alliance character!
---
I submitted a support ticket but they said they couldn't help me. Why is that button even there?
---
Never quit a game so fast.
---
Greatsword is extremely good. However at your level it really doesn’t matter. Play around and find one you like the move set of. 
---
I liked using greatsword and axe/axe while leveling. I also liked bow. Try a few and see which suites you.
---
I really dislike people that leave mid fight on anything. I personally have always managed to get gold on both bosses. I just join random LFGs
---
But if the group looked like they wasnt going to, I most definitely wouldn't ditch them and leave mid fight...
---
You can't play scarlets war (season 1) because it was happening as open world changes, which are gone now. In game you have a short recap.  
---
In short and by order:   
---
* season 2 is just story, and considered the weakest. You can skip if u don't care about story.   
---
* HoT - expansion, comes bundled with PoF now.  
---
* season 3 - tied to HoT. Episode 3 has bitterfrost frontier, which is an easy map to get ascended trinkets from. So if you don't care about story you can buy just that episode.  
---
* PoF - expansion.  
---
* season 4 - tied to PoF. has actually very good story, also comes with beetle mount and the skyscale. Very recommend.   
---
* season 5 aka IceBrood Saga aka IBS - tied to PoF, current story. You probably already have both of the episodes unlocked.
---
Tbh to get gold when do the Strike I usually go with 2 friends and we try to cover Support Chrono (with StM) or cQB, Heal Druid (that we skip if there already is 1 healer in the group and go for a Might Tempest) and Banner. After that the usual way to miss Gold is if we have too many people having fun with pewpew Soulbeast/Ranger at max range instead of stacking :p
---
But yeah even without specifying "gold" in the LFG I usually encounter the issue of mentionning to just come do damage/come DPS in my LFG and I have people in fully fledged support build joining and even if I can accept that for some people their very weird build is considered "DPS" from their point of view I refuse to accept that someone arrived at this classification with a Honor-Virtues-Friebrand character using a Mace and a Staff --'
---
I dont know if this will help you, but I have a foot peddle for push to talk. My friends find it funny. But it frees up my finger and stuff for better things. 
---
But you can buy foot peddles with more than one button on and they are just keys you assign your keyboard to. Perhaps look into them?
---
Now this is content
---
70g is nothing LUL
---
I had saved [this fast leveling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9z3sai/the_be_all_end_all_guide_to_the_fastest_way_to/) which a year old now but still pretty much correct.
---
The edit at the bottom is also to be take into consideration:
---
&gt;If you have a bit of money, professions such as Cooking and Jewelcrafting are really quick and good ways of leveling up.
---
Accoridng to [Gw2Craft](https://gw2crafts.net/total.html) leveling up Cooking would cost you 2-3g and Jawelcrafitng (the 2nd cheapest) 9-10g. So at the very least I would suggest leveling up Cooking because it can help you skip a few levels when you start getting a bit bored in a specific window between story episodes. While leveling up a [Crafting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting) profession using an [Item Booster](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Item_Booster) and a [Guild Crafting Boost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Crafting_Boost) is a good idea to maximise the xp you will get and reduce the cost (as the cost calculated on gw2craft is calculated assuming you crit 0 time while crafting).
---
yea too bad the minion army that death magic spawns will never actually let you ooc
---
condi removal can be achieved with consume or spectral walk, no need for an entire line..prot and carapace are nice indeed
---
dps-wise death isn't that bad after the rework but still weaker than soulreaping on an already weak dps(no need to cripple it further)
---
No longbow no respekt déso.
---
&gt; You can play for free
---
Totally agree on the other points, but not this one; being free to play is one of the main contributing factor of the dominating position of LoL, Fortnite and CSGO.
---
it's really unfortunate a lot of what should be basic pvp knowledge is lost/unknown by the current playerbase
---
especially rotational awareness is blissfully missing even in higher tiers
---
Not knowing much about this game: i can play both right? Like having another set or spec (wow like) and switching between them
---
Just give early leavers strike-dishonor for 2 days and solved. They can get their today's loot for the cost of tomorrow's one so they learn to commit to what they joined. Would work for raids as well as leaving groups and creating the BRUTAL big downtime is ruining the gamemode's population.
---
Okay thanks. And do you get the mounts and stuff just by progressing through the story or are they some kind of drops?
---
Yes, you just need to have the gear to do so and you change out at any time
---
Not necessarily. It could still be growing or stable but other games are growing at a faster rate. You could check if it's declining though by looking at the numbers the ranks are based on though to see if there is declining viewership or if it's just limited growth.
---
I have most of my keybinds next to each other because i have small hands, so I cant use an mmo mouse effectively:  
---
Weapon skills - 1-5  
---
Utility/heal/ult - alt+1-5  
---
Weapon swap - ~   
---
Special action - tab  
---
Movement - wasd  
---
F1-F5 still there, but I don't play anything that needs more than F1-F4.  
---
Interact still at F, and my dodge is mapped to my mouse side button but you shouldn't have trouble mapping those to something like v and b right above the trackpad.
---
Infusions, there are always infusions
---
You get raptor via story. Bunny and skimmer are required for the story, but you get them via open world heart.  
---
Jackel is heart+some gold (15 or 25, don't remember)  
---
Griffon you need to complete PoF for, and do a collection, and costs 250 gold.  
---
Beetle is a quick collection.  
---
Skyscale requires all of S4 and is a long collection, but not that expensive.
---
We already have those lol
---
dungeons and fractals are always good
---
It's hard to overstate
---
my satisfaction.
---
Even if I take a "static" screenshot in first person?
---
That sounds like the line a villain would say when taken to court to explain their actions :x
---
[Presenting...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJgUTVG9H4c)
---
&gt; but most classes play very similar and are extremely limited.
---
thats exactly how i feel about gw2 combat
---
Just enjoy the game .. don’t worry about that ... as soon as you enter a endgame zone you will see dozens of ppl playing ( and even in the starter zones you will find some )
---
Best way is to transmute t5 blood to t6 using the mystic forge. The t5 materials drop so much especially if you're doing daily fractals you will always have a ton of them. You can find the MF recipe here [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic\_Forge/Material\_Promotion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge/Material_Promotion) or on gw2 efficiency site
---
Listen, I do not even PvP anymore since cost benefit there are better way to earn money and have fun. But if u ask me what a noob should do to earn his asce see 2h weapon cheap this is they way. Anyway u would stay in lower bronze 3so not that problem for anyone who would like to play seriously.
---
If u do not think this is what happen in PvP even among that few who do not not I have a bad news for you.
---
It is not the most lawful legal practice but it is not even a chaotic evil one.
---
imo world vs world. super cheap to get exotic there, and u even can choose from about 5 stat sets.
---
LOL I do know the music OP talks about, but no wonder s/he can't find it, because no one bothered to record it. :D
---
i'd even say the first six servers on the ranking list are pretty much equally populated.
---
alacrity renegade in team games is fun. =)
---
Most of then don't work for win10 tough.
---
I am searching one to usecwith discord as well.
---
I wish I did, but I think Jeremy Soule didn't even bother to name it...
---
I have absolutly no idea what the comic is about.
---
omg mate i literally wrote and thought something close to this lately xD  
---
we need: 
---
\- proper rewards for activity (pvp gets freaking grandmaster shard boxes, thats 400%+ from wvw) 
---
\- rewards for server performance after a week  
---
\- EotM put into some use. such a cool map but for obvious reasons empty.  
---
unsure about tournaments - just an official leaderboard with weekly, monthly and maybe quartal rewards would be dope af though.
---
what i wanna add - wvw is a pretty unique format and extremly left out. the balancing and updates (have there been any, cannot tell after 1 year playing it) are barely spotable, rewards not good, etc.
---
Oldschool runescrape is maybe stealthily one of the most popular MMORPG's.  I remember a news article from earlier in the year where it said they have over 1m active players.
---
I was recently playing cele weaver in wvw, had guild aura from keep as well as protection and a DE kept immobilizing me and critting for 8-10k with DJ 2-3 times within a few seconds only.
---
Luckily most DE's aren't even close to being that good, they just permastealth and usually just die to a random reflect.
---
PvP doesn't require gear, it's totally different set of settings, mostly free.
---
For other modes you can use recent addition of [build templates](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Template).
---
Pretty much why I ecto gamble. I am mainly a pvp player, and don't care about cosmetics. If someone gifted me a million gold I wouldn't really have anything to spend it on.
---
Mine works fine with windows 10 and discord
---
i personally think wvw need rather proper rewards to bring players back to it. it doesn't lock anybody out - unlike raids and high fracts.
---
notsure if the "alliances" would change too much. wouldn't pull new players; i fact we always again have some newbies pop up but they don't understand what wvw is about in many cases. it gets not really well explained. 
---
all this pve-npc talk about "the mists" probs just confuses players, since mists exist in like 3 different game modes. fractals, pve, wvw and pvp have maps named sth with "mist"  
---
the warclaw was a sweet tease, but did really not benefit wvw too much. especially bc it became a "you need it to really do much"-thing plus because it got several nerfs yet. its utility is greatly limited, and the only real trashy thing (finished downed insta) did not get nerfed.
---
i'd say just add it as comp map. no need for a replacement. and maybe remove obsidian sanctum's arena bc EotM has a bigger one anyways.  
---
otherwise, i see no issue why you'd not make it a rated map too. its design is unique and great.
---
Quite a few things I found odd.
---
1. I hope you meant DD as daredevil, not dagger dagger cuz Power dagger dagger is really crappy in my opinion. 
---
2. 18550 HP is too high. The soft spot is usually somewhere around 15k. I'd usually just go full zerk if I have to go power, which is about 12k HP.
---
Now, for some general tips:
---
1. Power thief, including DE, has been hit quite hard. You'll hardly ever win a duel vs an equally competent enemy. Stalling is ok, but to win a 1v1 vs some crazier classes like Revenant, Soulbeast, Holo, Warrior, Guardian, and even Mesmers, you'll need quite some luck. XD 
---
I usually just fight without the intent to win, since I can just run away like a bastard anytime. Waste their cooldown. Waste their patience. Waste their utilities. 
---
2. Maintain your initiatives. It sounds like you're spamming every initiatives as quick as possible. 
---
3. You can search the rest, I'll just name a few common combos and tricks. DP 52 combo. SB 2 blast finishers. You can teleport to some really high grounds with SB5 and ShadowStep. SB 2 denotate (power) or SB 4 (condi) quickly followed be Steal. DP 52 STEAL for a free heartseeker attack before going invisible, follow with a back stab.
---
A few general PvP tips.
---
1. Dodge. Know what to dodge, and what to tank. 
---
2. Always have at least one stunbreak. I usually have ShadowStep and the block ability on Daredevil. As soon as you lose your stunbreak, start planning a "run for your life" retreat, or stall if you're confident. 
---
3. It's recommended to understand what the other classes are capable of.  Thief's purpose is to punish mistakes by dodging. Ex: knowing a typical Reaper trick (like how a crap ton of them start with Axe 2 &gt; ... &gt; GS 5 or Spectral Grasp &gt; Reaper), or a Holo combo (lets be real, it's always holo mode 352 xD) 
---
Hope this helps a bit.
---
Here's what you do"
---
\-find a safe spot
---
\-use dagger/pistol
---
\-press 5, then 2 2 2 in the smokefield (turn your camera around to get back into the field :D or 2 against a wall)
---
\-you have like 6 seconds of stealth now
---
\-sneak up on enemy
---
\-backstab into their evade so it misses
---
\-time runs out and you are revealed with half the initiative you started with
---
\-the enemy spellbreaker turns around and owns you like a Christmas present
---
Jokes aside. Use the 5 222 combo to initiate fights. Always try to plus 1 (turn 1v1s into 2v1s). Roam around the map and decap points. Remember, you are weak and squishy BUT stealth allows you to pick how you initiate fights. Your mobility is a massive asset to you for: evading dangerous situations, picking fights, finding and finishing off weakened enemies, decaping, etc.
---
There is no shame in running away, it is much better to come back later when you're ready for it or find a new opportunity somewhere else on the map.
---
i think some balancing would be working. would be kinda fun see zergs fighting on that small area thaha.  
---
as for luring people in, they could give it special rules. like, give it special buff for playing on it, changing up each day. one time rewards, then wxp gain, then rewards track gain etc... with enough activity and rated status it surely will be fun.  
---
about the siege devourer etc - i never saw that in action, the map is empty 99% of the time.  
---
ergo, whatever it is, the status quo is the worst case for it and a waste of ressources.
---
i think if you give EotM special rewards for playing, it would be populated, worth and fine, kinda as second EBG, just with less ground space.  
---
maybe limit queues more for it so it doesn't get overpopulated.   
---
the kick for afk'ers should be anyways a bit faster, some ppl just afk for 10min or so lol. just redirecting them to OS after 5-6min would be more fair for all players i think.
---
(T4)Haha, the amount of times there were people below or near my dps when I was a harrier hfb is kinda sad. 😦  
---
When I'm qb I'm almost always second in dps with a zerker-diviner mix.  
---
It's like a natual phenomena. Just with auto attacks you should be able to get decent dps with the amount of boons that get thrown around.
---
Doesn't it also play in some Divinity's Reach instances? Like the noble personal story or the season 2 party politics?
---
What ever you want to do. You need to find your own goals to achieve.  
---
Fractals? Dungeons? Skyscale? Mapchat trolling in divinity reach?
---
Well the rewards are another concern, especially with the new strike mission. Having the gold reward being something as worthless as a single rare bag means that people will not put the effort in to go for gold in the first place. Next, the main reward for these are the Etritite Ingots. If these remain to have the only function they currently have, which is crafting Boreal skins and the backpack, they will eventually decrease more and more in value as people are done with these or don't care about them. Which in turn removes even more motivation people would have to do these Strike Missions in the first place, and that is concerning.
---
well strike missions are supereasy, high tier fracts and raids exclusive and elitist. i play 1,5 years and i didn't touch raids nor higher than t1 fracts, despite having chars that could do it bc mainly equipped with metabuilds and ascended gear.
---
and bc i don't like crafting and the pve meta farms aren't really my thing, i mainly play wvw.  
---
and  if you look at Wvw participation rewards compared to PVP ones, you might notice that pvp gets freaking grandmaster mark shard boxes and wvw grandmaster marks shards, which is 1/10 acutally away from each other. plus pvp has tournaments and a ranked season. so no, they are not equally left out. :S
---
I really admire legendary ranger Eir
---
Wanna hear her ost
---
Choose an achievement or a set of skins (armor or weapons) and try to get those together. Many collections will require a bigger team to take down some bosses.
---
Me and my friends are almost done with the Legendary backpack Ad Infinitum. There is a lot to do with people. Just need to find something and stick to it.
---
Sell them back, salvage (for ecto), throw them into Mystic Forge and hope for someting good.
---
and i no you here. why are the copypaste borders a good thing? we're a t1 server, and most of the time stay t1 - but when we had due to lack of players bc of a weak link been #3 once, we also rallied and defended our hbl despite it beeing desert. desert BL is such a cool map, i honestly think it is a matter of taste to prefer the alpine borders. just make EotM a 2nd EBG.  
---
eotm needs surely some adaptions, but not too many. make its player cap smaller than for other BLs, give it unique participation rewards and give it rating, and it will work. i don't think this would hit the balance, couldn't think of how.  
---
(you could precise your statement tho, i don't fully understand why wvw isn't balanced mapwise. it sounds as if u think of desert BL as a inferior map, which surely isn't the case.)  
---
besides, the roation should be different from ebg, maybe make the starting position for EotM either cycle, random or contrary to ebg start.
---
your these about hitting SM from keeps may be true, but after all the outer of SM is kinda designed to be swiss cheese thaha.
---
thanks for caring to explain, kinda bummer tho
---
Is this the one that progresses 1 per day when doing 3 games ? Try 3 games tomorrow. Goodluck
---
heavily disagree with you here - made some posts about it yet.
---
if u play dolly walking simulator there, you don't play wvw at all.
---
What I think is interesting is that I got more straight-up exotic drops in WvW lately than I got in PvE. But yeah, in comparison you get a lot more stuff in PvE or PvP that you can make to gold than you can in WvW.
---
They did their best to drive up attendence in WvW. As it turns out *people do not want to WvW,* so it would be foolish of them to spend any development resources on that game mode.
---
exotic isn't special, that stuff is pretty common anyways by now. u even could buy ascended trinkets in lws3 and get a ascended caladlaldblog from the trahearne line + ascended weapon box drops from several world bosses. older players could yet buy it from dungeon vendors - which u still gotta do for the skins.
---
what shall i say, i don't care about the gold really. i see no real use for gold. for buying good stuff on the shop its not enough, for everything else it's too much. you get like 15 gold a day with shop-selling and dailies.  
---
i like your "equal rewards" idea, just that precisely might be tough due to the different currencies. maybe if we talk "same quality" it could be fine. but then raid people would cry. pvpers be disappointed, openworld would be a hard choice bc they technically have the collections anyways so would feel left out. and idk about fractals thaha.
---
well, maybe if nobody carries or they try it for the first time.
---
I know it doubles your effort, but what I did was craft both Sunrise and Twilight, list them on the trading post, then buy ordered Eternity.
---
Binding Eternity got me the skins I just made and a legendary greatsword, and at the time crafting Eternity was a 1000g loss, so I came out 1000g ahead.
---
Check the TP prices on these items, it might be worthwhile for you to do it this way.
---
how did they? i realized nothing at all towards that direction. and the t 1-3 servers still have population and queues on the weekends.  
---
the warclaw did draw many pve'rs in and did show how "too much" people would look. but it's after all just pve content put to wvw, so doesn't count as drawing people in.  
---
and furthermore, the warclaw now scares newbies off, bc they get jumped by roamers while they try to get their scraps of warclaw journal lol. plus some veterans stopped playing bc they dislike it. enabeling superspeed for blobs also wasn't a really good thing that warclaw brought.   
---
not to mention all the nerfs warclaw got yet.
---
Oh come on... They are very well aware of the fact that this is the game where the skill cap between certain playerbases is the biggest. They even said that in an interview recently. 
---
The fact that this game still doesn't have proper difficulty modes is a tragedy.
---
I feel like this needs a lot of qualifiers. There are populations in early zones, particularly Queensdale, but really all of them. That doesn't have to mean there are zergs. I always see people in low level zones and I've often in low level zones, for all sorts of reasons.
---
There are enough people in those low level zones to get all the content done, including group events as you're leveling. 
---
Are there more people in the end game zones? Sure. I agree there are.  But saying there's not a lot in the starter zones, while literally true, can also be misleading. There are plenty of people in starting zones, enough to do all the content.
---
I just did the new one tonight ..drunk..one shot and i was top dps....
---
Holy shit dude you do not get my point. My point is PvP sucks right now because of the bots and the people who don’t take it seriously. Which is a problem. That needs fixing. 
---
I don’t care why people bot. I don’t care why some people don’t take it seriously. I care that ANet seems like they’re not trying at all to save this game mode for the people who actually enjoy PvP. 
---
I especially don’t care if you think this is the easiest way to get an ascended weapon. Go to WvW and walk Yaks while you watch Netflix. At least that way you’re not fucking over people who want to PvP.
---
I recently started playing again and the population in cities and starter areas seems very healthy, comparable to FF14 or at least not much less. 
---
In fact, due to the addition of "megaservers" (the game collates people across servers into the same maps if individual instances get too low) the early zones are more lively than I've seen then except for when the game first launched. Back before Arenanet added that feature, the early level zones depopulated very quickly once the initial wave of first players hit the cap, and the cities apart from Lion's Arch were mostly deserted.
---
Despite a lot of the pessimism around the game's support long-term (which isn't unjustified), if you're looking to get into the content as it currently exists, the game in no way looks like an MMO in decline.
---
(Caveat: I've heard non-world vs world PVP is underpopulated and full of bots, but I don't play that mode so I can't comment).

icibici seems to be the cheapest working one, but it's not like it works that well.
---
**Brain–computer interface**
---
A brain-computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a neural-control interface (NCI), mind-machine interface (MMI), direct neural interface (DNI), or brain-machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) under a grant from the National Science Foundation, followed by a contract from DARPA. The papers published after this research also mark the first appearance of the expression brain–computer interface in scientific literature.
---
Due to the cortical plasticity of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels.

The person you replied to never said that they wants free stuff. They just don't enjoy your preffered mode. Stop being assblasted on the internet and grow up.

For the good of all of us, except the ones who have quit.
---
&gt;I always see people in low level zones and I've often in low level zones, for all sorts of reasons.
---
Why do high-level players go back to the low level zones? I was playing back in 2012 and 2013, and back then one of the big issues was that players didn't have any reason to go back to areas they had passed. I remember Arenanet talking about coming up with ways to fix this, but I stopped playing before they did. Now coming back to the game I'm seeing tons of max-level players with high mastery numbers, so I guess they must have.
---
I've seen sub 1k even in training raids I commanded in the past. Some people really only autoattack and even then interrupt them with dodges.
---
it is not a shame that things get fixed.
---
Yeah, episode 4.6: Epilogue
---
"Ok guys, world's over, see you next iteration in Guild Wars 3!"
---
Is this Love?
---
I didn’t find the aesthetics all that stunning. I mean it looked good, but it was more the return to Heart of Thorns map design that I liked most about it. I’m probably one of the few that really liked Istan though. Sand swept was a nice map too, just mostly vacant.
---
The new map just feels like bitter frost with a meta , and I’d honestly say bitter frost is a little more appealing to me.
---
Map completion for gifts of exploration and legendary weapons. I have a fresh level that I boosted just to do map completion
---
Baby don't hurt me
---
Partly it's collections and farming. Tons of people farm iron and softwood and also platinum and hardwood.  People who are interested in farming mats instead of gold.
---
Many collections require you to do stuff like the Shadow Behemoth or get stuff from hearts in low level zones too.
---
Also there are things like beetle races, which some people enjoy. Some people enjoy leveling alts. People who are working on legendaries need world complete.
---
And believe it or not, a lot of people go back to low level zones just because they enjoy them.
---
When you played the mega server didn't exist either, which meant that every single server had to have enough people in low level zones, but that situation hasn't existed since HoT. With the advent of the mega server, there are no more PvE servers and maps are created and destroyed as they're needed or no longer needed respectively.  
---
That means you can have a critical mass of players in each zone with far fewer players.
---
All these things together means the game feels plenty populated.
---
NPCs that lose to things they logically shouldn't.
---
Because allied NPCs are made to be super crappy.
---
Hello everyone, than you for your answers. Yes DD means Dagguer/Dagguer. I'll try other solutions then. Thank you all for your help.
---
If your focus is PvP, go find a different game. PvP in GW2 is currently a shit-stewpot of 50% bots and 50% people whining about bots.
---
High grind content is oh so popular on twitch. Oh wait its not.
---
Only thing you can do is wait for the support.
---
Who plays glint in fractals? You never go Herald for raids nor fractals. Except for hand kiting.
---
dps Herald used to be a thing and a few ppl still bring that occasionally to raids just to have fun
---
that was jalis/shiro tho
---
Gear template slots for your guardian.
---
I'll bring just my harvesting tool/weapons and show them how its done!!!11
---
Thank you for the helpful reply! I'll contact support further and give them as much information as possible.
---
Going back to your "gambling regulations don't apply here" doesn't seem to be correct though... because according to the following link it is in some cases.
---
https://dutchgamesassociation.nl/news/loot-boxes-netherlands-gaming-authoritys-findings/
---
Questions would be what they think is "transferable" as in "can be traded to other players" (which the BLCs would fall under) or it has to be outside of the game.
---
I'd be kinda scared to have that implanted..
---
This is fault of Anet and not the players. Without a built in dps meter players wont know if they're good or bad except word of mouth from strangers who could be talking truthfully or in toxicity. Don't ignore the actual issue and blame players wanting to play content in a game where the breakbar mechanic still has no good tutorial.
---
Same contacted support, by the time they fixed it I saved the gold and custom exchanged it. In the end it saved me money !
---
A little bit too late for any of that. Good for the remaining few players that stuck through it all, but most have moved on. Not a free fall but a temporary straw to hold on to before the inevitable crash. And no there's not even close to enough new players in PvP to make up for the loss of all the veterans.
---
But there's no sense crying over Anet's mistakes
---
You just keep on playing till you run out of raids
---
Ye that’s quite helpful but not that expensive
---

Reminds me of WvW.
---
Players that lose to things they logically shouldn't.
---
Biggest reason why I hate death magic and minionmaster builds lol. You can never ooc, ever.
---
Unless those were all full accounts with access to daily login rewards, I see no reason for someone to bot with that many..
---
Yeah most of season 3 was with taimi now she barely gets a word in.
---
B-but fashion wars?
---
try riding a mount and draining a moving devouver in the pof story or gliding-aim-drop or shoot or cast moving targets in hot without a mouse use a keyboard, the thumb and pointer finger.
---
Dragon stand is an (endgame?) map meta where many random players meet and play together.
---
For what you've planned (or questioned): You need friends that would be patient enough to wait until all of you finished. This was indeed a problem with our guild when the game was released, that some were too fast and didn't want to wait and others were too slow that didn't want to skip things **when playing as a group**.
---
Clearly a metaphor for the relationship between the player base and Anet... only I'm not sure who is which.
---
You say your writs are not steady, but what about your arms? Maybe a myo controller can help.

I've work with one in the past and extended their JS wrapper to write a browser plugin that let's me navigate websites.

Unfortunately, they are no longer oficially sold, but you might get a used one somewhere.
---
Cheers =)
---
I 100% suggest Soulreaping+spite.
---
Death magic is a meh line. Recent update was neat but it still just doesn't seem too fit into anything necro is good at. Best options for that line really is only the top 3 traits so you can run a minionmaster build (the definitive braindead build). Problem with minionmaster, though, is that 1. You'll never be able to get ooc because minions are dumb shits who you cant control, and 2. It reinforces poor gameplay because you are nearly invincible.. in open world.
---
I suggest soul reaping + spite, the common power reaper meta build, because even with that build, you'll still be crazy tanky (necro is just tanky be default. Its got two health bars, what do you expect? To die in 2 hits like a thief?) And most things will die too fast to worry about tankiness. Also, since you won't be invincible, it reinforces good gameplay by forcing you to learn how to properly dodge, position skills, and so on, better preparing you for higher end content and overall making you a better player/necro.
---
Also its debatably way more fun to be a one man show than to brainlessly spam autoattack until something dies without even dodging.
---
there isnt even 160 games in world gratz dead game on placing 163 lul
---
if the keypad sits flat and secure on the desk, yes. it is possible.
---
Completely this. Yeah I want to finish achievements for this chapter, but losing Blish and listening to Gorrik break down like that hurts so much.
---
Kripp exploited something very obviously unintended, not once, not twice, but repeatedly.
---
Like, make the argument that it would've still been a positive, it's all subjective (I don't think it's a good way to start things off when you tolerate exploiting like that, but to each their own), but don't act as if he did nothing wrong :)
---
It was colorable weapons or a trading post. They decided to implement the trading post.
---
does gw2 support keypads?
---
Same thing happened to me during the weekend. Been playing for 3 years straight with no hassle and all of a sudden all my purchases got that error message. I contacted support about it, as I saw another thread discussing it and they said to contact support since every case is different, and the day after it was sorted 😊
---
You could come at this a couple of ways:  
---
Which zones are the most tangled and hardest to navigate?  
---
For me personally that tends to be Ascalon.  
---
Which spread of zones gives the most access to other zones?  
---
Maguuma Jungle backs up to Drytop &amp; SW 2 endpoints of kryta AND Orr (Sparkfly Fen and Mt Maelstrom are considere Maguuma zones IIRC), the shiverpeaks (Timberline Falls and Lornar's pass), as well as 2 home cities.  So in the case of access to granted to the rest of the map, Maguuma might be your best bet.  
---
Generally covering the most ground?  Shiverpeaks or Ascalon.  Kryta and the Maguuma have plenty of area, but the Shiverpeaks and Ascalon span a far greater distance North/South, meaning it takes much longer to traverse them.  Kryta goes pretty far north/south too but the land is generally a bit flatter and less difficult to navigate.  Except Hirathi Hinterlands.  Screw that place, get a flying mount.  
---
Another consideration is what set of zones do you find yourself in far too often?  The "I'm always having to come to this rotten place so why not" methodology is perfectly logical here.  
---
On the same token, if there is a region you haven't ever touched, having the waypoints in place will make exploration a bit less bad later on.  
---
And finally, if you have access to mounts, especially the beetle, please consider not buying these things.  Use the beetle for the waypoint unlocks, it takes all of an hour or so per character in core tyria.
---
if u call 1,4 years "long term", then yes. i started wvw pretty early with a horribly bad equipped warrior and used a special supporting build to hit enemy zergs, and the reward track farms i go from this gave me basically a ton of exotics with free choosable stats + acess to hero points and runes.  
---
the ascended gear dropped either or was rankup rewards and i just had to change the stats on them. plus cheap infusions.
---
the regular ascended drops are only rings yeah. i mainly got some chests, but an armor has only six pieces thaha. and i play warrior, guardian who share a equipment class. and the trinkets are shared with my holo.
---
&gt;  high tier fracts and raids exclusive and elitist
---
Sound like a you problem, with mental barriers and not trying to give a shot. There are training guilds for raids, and yeah it's harder nowadays to progress through T2 to T4 because fractals aren't exactly "fresh" but I'm pretty sure it's still possible.
---
There will always be stupid people to exclude new players out of gamemodes. Don't base your opinions on stupid people's behaviors.
---
As u said I do not do PvP anymore for the very reason it is only bots and ppl farming pips . I was just telling you why the situation is the one it is now .wvw escort reward less than PvP and  you can be killed and wasted your time.
---
I am not suggesting this is the best thing to do. Just saying how it is
---
assuming there's a "best build", idk. i don't play thieves myself, but basically thats what they do. melee thieves are far weaker bc they have to get in range of highdps melee chars.
---
Where to use the waypoint unlocker that I got from shop? Fresh account btw.
---
HA NO pull your own weight sucker
---
"...no engi will be a healer in ftactals" - poor poor scrapper. F xD
---
i just did the weekly strikes, but it was quite chill. people are dpsbots often and get rekt in process, and that was even a group of full mastery 300 ones lol. freanir i think it was, he has a burst before he dies, and if u don't know that it's "gg" once - but every group with a brain just regos and takes care ;P  
---
i didn't do raids yet really, only one pre of it (which was pretty easy, an escort), but i know my builds. learnt to play by dying in wvw :P
---
Hmm, I think I like that my "I-do-not-care-style" is kind of unique automatically. It would be a lot harder to compete would I focus on the female human meta with some scarf and infusions. :)
---
On the other hand, I do dye the stuff I wear, so it is not as bad as you might think.
---
I'm a mainly PVE player who has just started dipping into PVP (wanted to get some daily potions for guild upgrades). It's pretty fun so far. I guess what I wanted to ask is, are there any basic/common sense pvp tips that any vets can share? I've been standing in circles and spamming my aoe skills as a scourge, which buys enough time for my teammates to rescue me from death and defend the point. Is there anything else I should be doing? Is standing in a circle while my teammates fight elsewhere afking?
---
with that argumentation you could close many maps at all, bc nobody does the metas. lws3 for example... also finding someone to do bounties with you is a pain, even if u only would need like 10 people and its not prime.
---
also how 30-40 people queues (thats the current EBG weekend stand) is "not enough" is pretty enigmatic to me. rather view it from that part: there's still a ton of people playing this abbandoned format, that should be enough reason to push it.
---
Any sure way to earn gold from Aitship Parts is this thing: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pruning_Shear - it's terrible conversion though, compared to what you could earn early after HoT release. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley-Energy_Matter_Converter is the only other decent choice - but to be exact, the best way to convert them to gold value is if you create new character and want to gear it into exotic Diviner/Harrier/Viper/Trailblazer/Minstrel... and other more expensive armor sets - you can buy boxes with all armor pieces other than chest armor.
---
the farm for the agony res is boring, that's kinda all keeping me from attempting higher levels of them. plus i hate jumping parts. it's not about possibility. i might at some point just look for a pve/fract/raid guild, but that point isn't now.
---
i wanted to write "feels exclusive" not phrase it as dogmatic "are", my bad. this "ping" thing for example is nowhere explained within the game, and people even sell raids. that shows how overproportionally they stand compared to literally all other gamemodes.  
---
and yeah not saying all raiders are bad, met some nice people in the lobby yet. the lobby chill took longer time than the escort pre-raid. and idk why people don't just farm these escorts, they're super easy.
---
It's still a core design philosophy. Sometimes they just make mistakes, and other times it actively conflicts with some types of content.
---
&gt;with that argumentation you could close many maps at all, bc nobody does the metas. lws3 for example... also finding someone to do bounties with you is a pain, even if u only would need like 10 people and its not prime.
---
Bounties as a concept never worked out, it was like Stronghold. 
---
And individual PvE maps do die off, there are a ton of them, but the people shift from one to the next, and only the most recent and a few of the evergreen ones are heavily populated, but between those they hold the majority of the game's population. 
---
Adding new PvE maps is much more effective than adding new WvW maps, since in WvW, the players are meant to be the primary engagement. The problem is that 1. There aren't enough people who actually *want* WvW PvP to make that viable, and 2. even if they add PvE content, most PvEers don't want to go there because they don't want other players ganking them when they're just trying to do PvE stuff. 
---
It takes a certain type of player to *want* what WvW has to offer, and there just aren't all that many of those. 
---
&gt;also how 30-40 people queues (thats the current EBG weekend stand) is "not enough" is pretty enigmatic to me. 
---
Because 30-40 people is absolutely nothing in the scope of a game with hundreds of thousands playing. And that's not even *all* the time!
---
Wolves do lose fights to deer IRL tho; it's one reason they hunt in packs.
---
how much dps do you do in T4 fractals thats not bad?
---
Have you played 3 ranked games since reset?
---
Braham — He's acting like a child in HoT, LS3 and half of the LS4. And then — like a teenager.
---
mastery says nothing about skill. i wish people would be dps bots, but i know the reality from raids. the majority of groups isnt even able to burst on the simpliest bosses.
---
also whatever you usw in wvw, it probably doesnt overlap with raidbuilds at all. (w3 escort, while it gives an LI, isnt considered a real fight by the community. you dont even have an enrage timer)
---
but it seems we have very different approaches for strikes. i mean, your sentence "are dps bots and get rekt" sums that up pretty well. thats your job as dps. for everything else you have your buffer and healer. (sure, you still arent supposed to stand in red circles, but those are gamebasics)
---
Yup, all dead.
---
But dead inside
---
maybe I misread the ban post. but still 60 accounts is like 100% of the pvp playerbase :D
---
if it's well within the confines of the game, it's not an exploit. Anet fucked up and refused to admit fault, not much has changed since 2012
---
[Basics of PvP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7t0bqo/pvp_for_noncompetitive_players_beginner_and/) i.e. these are the rules of baseball/crickette even though you've seen them on television
---
&gt;"twitch is only for veterans"
---
Is this a view some people really hold? I rarely use twitch, but I'll occasionally pop on to check out a game I'm interested in buying to see how game-play looks, or to grab my prime freebies. I'm really the opposite of "twitch is only for veterans".
---
Thank you so much! Take a bite!
---
On a more serious note... that thing looks hella delicious. I feel some weird crave for a browny coming up :3
---
Must be a guardian. Try that grub on mes, much easier
---
Don't hurt me
---
Oh yeah, I'm not fond of infusions either (not like I could afford the flashy ones) and I have male charr so most armor is weirdly stretched haha
---
Yup. After I saw my GF cry from you toxic little kiddies I realized this player base is too far gone.
---
I first played the game during closed beta(although I didn't play during 2013-2018) and yet 70g was still half my gold, I guess I just suck at making money.
---
If that wasn't the case, then strike missions wouldn't have existed and we have Difficulty modes by now.
---
The game is doing you a favor.
---
The Arah track awards shards of zhaitan which can buy full berserkers gear. No need to use gold or Karma. 
---
I also used seels of beetletun from caudecus Manor track to buy rampagers. That's pretty good for starter condi builds
---
&gt; First one is a good support, 
---
No, it's an extremely extremely subpar support when compared to what else it could be doing.
---
Herald itself is fine (still noticeably below average in PvE), but fine.
---
Dwarf Herald is bad.
---
&gt; second is one of the best healers 
---
Healing tempest is indeed quite good, not sure why OP complained about it.
---
&gt; and the third is perfectly viable DPS that can do 25k+. 
---
OP said "condition **base** warrior", implying base warrior with no elite spec, also known as "core warrior".
---
Condition core warrior is really bad.
---
lmao that's true
---
If you want PvP content this isn't the game.  Anet has done a remarkable job ignoring PvP and WvW with very little updates like new maps or game modes.  It's gotten stale, and while the combat is fun a lot of people have moved on to other games which has led to what feels like a rise in bots but really it's just a lack of player base that use to be there.
---
Anything above 10k (which is really easy if you go with a decent composition) will make CMs possible and not that painful
---
Note that the higher the better, as bursting through phases will reduce the amount of time you need to pay attention to mechanics/insta, sometimes avoiding them entirely if DPS is high enough.
---
&gt;The biggest thing about blood magic being used as a dps is transfusion. When a party member goes down and you're facetanking shit, you're gonna pull them right into the damage.
---
Ah, right. When I said "more life steal with wells, group revives" I meant taking 1-3-1 in Blood Magic (Ritual of Life, Vampiric Presence, Vampiric Rituals); Ritual of Life is more than enough with Well of Blood and Lesser Well of Blood on the reviving side, and I know well enough how ~~hilariously~~ disastrous Transfusion can be.
---
Remember that NPC that attacked a sheep and lost? Good times.
---
This is not a You problem, this is a "Company has no fucking clue what they are doing" problem. You put out content all the time, and its quality even funny a lot of the time. But the fact of it is A-nets game means next to nothing to the gaming population right now. It has been out of the lime light for so long, the only ones who know about the game are those who play or have played.  
---
People on the outside don't give a single shit, I doubt unless massive sweeping changes happen that this game will ever have large presence on twitch or mixer or even youtube. Its niche,  because its designed to be niche\~
---
farming lws3 or 4 currencies will allow you to buy ascended trinkets/back pieces, that and pvp is probably the quickest way
---
Post like this are why I hate reddit.
---
He simply stated his opinion (an opinion I fully agree with) and he gets thumbed down for no reason.
---
Seriously, it feels like the people who thumbed him down are just salty thst they aren't good at the game. That's not the games fault.
---
In gw1 there is a former 8v8 pvp mode called hall of monuments, now its doable solo with 7 npcs and still you only see bots fighting each other24/7
---
Insignias - I believe you can only craft these.  
---
Trinkets/Backpiece
---
* Bitterfrost (S3 map) currency farm is the easiest for Asc. Back, 1 Trinket, and 1 Ring.
---
* Bloodstone (S3 map) currency farm gets you stat selectable and re-settable Back/Necklace/Ring, but this farm isn't done as much as it used to be and is quite the grind.
---
* Sandswept Isles (S4 map) currency farm is another decent farm for Asc. 1 Trinket and 1 Ring.
---
* Bjora Marches (S5 map) currency farm after completing "The Hunger" achievement lets you buy a stat selectable Necklace for pennies.
---
* Fractals Mist Trinket/Necklace/Ring is another stat selectable and re-settable items
---
Make sure you're happy with playing Alacrigade. It's not bad but I see a lot of people yelling for Healgrade too, so if you enjoy support you might enjoy going Harrier instead.
---
It really does help some people folks.
---
Wait, you need all that much Branded Mass, Serpentite and Ectos just to craft the insignia and inscriptions?
---
I thought you got extra Eitrite Ingots for Gold and Silver, no?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s_Orichalcum-Imbued_Inscription
---
Since you only need the exotic insignia/inscription to stat swap the ascended gear, this is the only thing you need.
---
Yeah. The meta is fairly generous, though.
---
┬┴┬┴┤ ͜ʖ ͡°) ├┬┴┬┴ .....oooooooooooouuuuuuuhhhh
---
From the wiki it looks like theres nothing mentioned.
---
It won’t let me friend I wvw until level 60. That had been my original plan for him.
---
Why would I read all the responses, I have better things to do.
---
If you want money, go sell some of the Mystic Coins you collected from dailies in 2012.  They're sitting forgotten in your Collectibles tab, but you can get well over 70 gold just by selling a fraction of them.
---
You might want to keep some for personal use, but if you want gold more, then you have to use the sources of gold you have, right?
---
Why is it an abuse? Maybe the person has some emergency that pops up right after the fight started for a while. 
---
You could argue for a similar dishonor system to be added to pve strike missions but I am not sure that will sit well with the PvE casual players.
---
I say that if you leave in the middle of combat, YOU are the reason why those people won't get better. You deny them to have at least single fight to be either lost or won, and to evaluate how they performed. You disrupt whole team. Have in mind that strike party is locked there so they even can't get someone else instead. 
---
It is not hard to get through 2 minutes fight and then deal with who contributes how much. But once you are leaving, you are taking over the role of person who denied the fight to be performed well (even though it wasn't true until you left).
---
After all, less performing team is very nice way how to call challenge mote, but I guess people are there only for loot and not for a real challenge anyways....
---
Hello,
---
I was wondering if the strike mission awards is repeatable in order to get Eitrite Ingots for the 32 slots bags?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
It's not basically what we do. It's basically what people who want to play cheese do.
---
Melee has way more survivability. Way more useful when fighting multiple people. You won't be one shoting people, but you also aren't going to be scared of sentries, and constantly running away from fights when you fail to one shot someone.
---
Perma stealth is just cheese. Thief isn't exactly top tier for group fights, but staff can fuck up an entire group of people, S/P can stun lock classes, and S/D can chase people down pretty good, boon strip naturally, have an unlockable attack. Rifle and backstab only have one big damage hit, then a bunch of nothing else. They can't even hide in a group like burnbrand can, cause their one hit will get blocked, then they will just die to trash damage not even aimed at them.
---
They have like two strengths. Being an annoying +1 in a small party, and taking down single targets that don't know how to fight them.
---
Per character or account ? 
---
Thanks mate
---
How does the shaky wrist translate to something like a joystick/flight stick?  I know they are less common these days but when I was a kid I would map them to all sorts of games.  Might be a slightly more stable option than a mouse. 
---
Your other hand useful at all? Perhaps to press a single button in a controller or use a dpad?   I have my mount and quick action tied to tilting my mouse wheel either left or right.  Maybe a similar set up could aid you in this and other games. 
---
My last suggestion is the logitech g13 keypad. It works well with gw2. I use the mini joystick on it for moving and have 90% of my most used keys within easy reach of 3 fingers but could be set for 1 finger. Granted I do use it in conjunction with my mouse.  But the g13 has profiles you can swap on the fly so you could have 3 layers of controls set up in the same keys so you could mount and swap to the second setup and have more options at your fingertips. 
---
Also do you play using the action camera at all?  Makes the game a little more like a shooter but don't know if that is easier or harder for you
---
I am playing the Power DPS DH now and I'm enjoying it a bunch, though being a potato player I die semi-frequently. Was thinking of looking into FB but I only really play open world - does it offer more survivability?
---
I’ve seen it posted elsewhere, and verified it yesterday, that you can loot those essence chests simply by joining a squad that completed it before the instance closes. Is this intended?
---
Apparently you couldn't even read the original post where he says he can't use them either. 
---
But apparently you have enough time to half(I'm being generous)  read something and spit out a useless comment to "help" and just end up reinforcing his beliefs that the community is becoming more and more apathetic.
---
Eso has inflated numbers due to twitch drops. Plenty of viewers are just there for the drops and may not even be watching at all. Warframe does the same thing (and PoE for some things as well). Not saying any or all of thoses games are less popular, but they definitely have inflated viewership.
---
Gw2 can offer Twitch drops aswell. Opportunities are there, anet doesnt use them.
---
I'm kinda curious how it would work to not use a mouse with GW2, but it seems like it could work decently well. I'd probably keep strafing left/right on A/D like I have it now and bind turning to the numpad along with the skills I usually bind to the mouse. And of course make ground target skills lock on to targets.
---
Which skins did you get out of this? From my impression you should have only gotten eternity, dawn and dusk. Not sunrise or twilight.
---
Just use foot controller...
---
Congratulations my friend.
---
From my understanding, there's a very small number of people on the support team that handle deletion requests, so just sit tight. They haven't forgotten about you. 
---
Hope you get better, dude.
---
Addiction is a serious thing, even if it’s to gaming. We wouldn’t recommend a drug addict try to manage their own recovery, so I definitely don’t think trying to un-addict yourself to games on your own is a good idea.
---
I’d talk to your parents about psychological services that would be willing to, or even specialize in, treating gaming addiction. They can get you the help you need.
---
Offer twitch support, bundle Season 3 with the Hot+PoF experience, Bundle Season 2 with the core game (seriously, I would be questioning purchasing any content from Anet if I came from the F2P campaign and dropped more money than an expansion on season 2)
---
Release on steam... I am pretty certain that this sort of move would be a huge injection of funds into the game.
---
Maybe you should sell your account. If you’ve been playing nonstop for 6 years to the point you have to force yourself to stop permanently, you likely have one of the best accounts out there. You could potentially get upwards of a thousand or even several thousand for it. That person will surely change the password and you won’t be able to play anymore, but you’ll get some of your money back
---
Oh I'm really sorry about my poor advise then.  I hope you find a way to play x x
---
Continue this. Trust in your professional help. Keep communicating. Have an open mind. Share this with everyone you know even friends in-game, so they can also form under the support umbrella you already have. Who knows, some may share this struggle with you too, and by sharing, we help support each other.
---
Dude, you need to find something that makes you happy and that gives you a purpose, it could be some kind of sport, volunteering, you need to get into something that gives you a sense of belonging, where you know you have friends and that you are important to them.
---
You keep coming back to gaming because you feel the need to fill that emptyness in your life, but if you find what makes you passionate about life you will slowly need less and less of gaming.
---
You mentioned that you are delaying your education, maybe that's because what you are studying is not what you like to do, that's why you procrastinate so much, maybe if you put college on hold for now and try something different, like going to a trade school and learn to do some type of skilled manual labor, that may make you feel more engaged with what you are learning.
---
The problem is not the gaming itself, the problem is that theres something missing in your life, and you are filling that void with gaming.
---
The thing is. I actually do have things to do. That is exactly the problem I value gaming over anything else which has caused me to delay my degree by 4 years already. I probanly would habe been a madter of engineering by now if it had not been for my gaming addiction.
---
Trust me I feel ya, I went to place a buy order for a smoke shaman tonic( during a buy order war) and by doing it super quickly i ended up buying all 17 of them for ~9000 gold. 
---
Devs acknowledge its a problem (https://imgur.com/a/Yqtqrk8), but its been around since the TP change way back when.
---
Criticism is not toxicity.
---
I hope you're right. Thanks.
---
Unrelated note but it's funny how they never in those 8 years fixed the hyphen character (-) so it doesn't appear on the bottom of the line like underscore (_) making things in the UI look like they were debug placeholders.
---
Why not just go to the other maps and pick up the materials directly there?  It's only as much of a grind as you make it be, but there's usually an event chain or a few hearts that are easy to complete to give you some currency.
---
I mean, if you're only mining an Eternal Ice node and then trading it for the other currencies, I hope you're at least going to Dragonfall to buy other currencies there for karma too, as a merchant there lets you...
---
there's the good old support loophole
---
Anet will [delete](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001357228-I-Want-to-Delete-My-ArenaNet-Account) or [close](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000712327) accounts upon the owner's request, FYI. This was added in last year when they had to become compliant with European GDPR laws :)
---
Be rational and sell it, instead of deleting.
---
Bullcrap it is a bad thing since they lazy with developing and fixing classes and balance issues that have plagued the game since they tried to appeal to e sports.
---
you might get faster results if you do it alone, but do you also have more fun?
---
Why hello! It was supposed to be a part of #inktober and I drew a pencil sketch but didn't finish it on time. So now I added some colours by Photoshop. Her name in Nycta Umre. If you are interested you can find my other art here https://www.deviantart.com/ryumo =)
---
The value of strike missions is for players to improve who need it.
---
In last week's strike mission, when we had to defeat Lolek and Bolek if we killed either of them and left the group I would be awarded both chests.
---
So put a &amp;&amp; and not a || between them.
---
This is an extreme thing you can do, but you could remove the graphics card from your computer. It will still function for everything you might need it as purely School device, but it will remove the ability to play most modern games and severely curtail being able to watch YouTube videos in the like online.
---
certainly, the professional help and everything else you're doing, is absolutely the way to go. If you are sitting there staring at the screen though and your fingers start to itch, I would imagine this is at least a last-ditch sort of thing to do.
---
\*Gemstore is breathing heavy into your ear\* Hi
---
True. Rn I don't have a computer.
---
However it is always easier to get bavk intl gaming if you don't habe to start from scratch, right?
---
Pardon me while I strap this onion on my belt. 
---
So, I spent a lot of time in college playing video games. This was the early 90s, so this was an actual video arcade. I played a LOT of Street Fighter variations. I wasn't bad, either. I could generally hold my own against about anyone. 
---
My senior year, this guy showed up at the arcade I was at, and he has only one arm. He laid his quarter on the machine to take me on, and I'm thinking this won't end well for him. I mean, how is he going to make this work? A joystick and six buttons? There's no way this can work. 
---
Yeah. About that. 
---
He gripped the joystick between his index and thumb, and his remaining fingers were able to hit the other six buttons with no problem. I proceeded to get my ass kicked eight ways to Sunday. 
---
Over the course of that last semester, I was able to play him more than a few times and watched him against other folks. Dude was just GOOD. Anyway, that was a true lesson in humility there, and I'm glad I learned it.
---
I've seen this be done a few times... Someone rocks up in a city and does a sort of 'santa giveaway' where people que up and get given something
---
It could work as a deterrent for you to come back as you'd have nothing
---
Excactly what I am planning to do. :)
---
You need delete all your game acounts, sell your gaming PC and buy shity one only for work and study. Go outside and find new friends. That's my little adwaise
---
Calling them pathetic is not a good look... Addiction is addiction no matter what it is for and its negatively impacting their life, if it was that easy for them they would have just stopped
---
Fractal CMs are mostly mechanics.  Mechanics get crisper as DPS gets more competitive and optimized.  I think players are more willing to excuse essences for FB/Ren than anything else unless at 4/5.  Personally, I don't really trust LNHB that much anymore, but it's better than nothing, and if you have it that's a mild indicator that you're competent.  
---
Just try to play well, be friendly and build some rapport with people that LFG frequently.  For example, there's an Engineer player that goes above and beyond that I like playing with; uses consumables, even more uncommon one's like Hylek Poison Pots (Swiftness) and has some creative super-speed pinata skips.  Being a proper team player goes a long way.  
---
I think being willing to go above and beyond with consumable CC; Slaying Sigils (Night/Krait for Siax/Ensolysus) &amp; Potions of Scarlet Slaying Armies really do help sustain higher damage.  They're free damage boosts that are easy to use.  It takes a little while to get in the habit, but you can push much better DPS when you're taking advantage of them.
---
it has.
---
default is left click + right click i think.
---
I did not know it was update, thanks for that!
---
I actually am doing that atm.
---
I already got confirmation for deleting my steam and riot games account. My PC goes to my father and my beother gets the grafics card. I gladly have a lot of good friends willing to spend time with me.
---
I don't know anything about it, but if I had to guess, it might not be the code being related so much as they only had time/manpower to do one or the other.
---
Yeh I quit a while ago, I just deleted all of my items and characters. If you wanna "delete" your account, just get a simple gw2 hack and use it.
---
don't be sorry. because your and other advises can help someone else that fit the situations. we are on a reddit forum.
---
For that I would have to play the game which is what I am trying not to do. ;)
---
Well also true. Just deleting your stuff should be good then.
---
Pretty sure you can share your story progress once you hit story level 60 or something
---
&gt;That's exactly the attitude that ANet has always hated
---
  
---
which is why anet is a shit company and this game is now in maintenance mode. And it opens a slippery slope of what constitutes an exploit, because back when there was multiloot, that was way more economic earth shattering than what kripp did, but nobody got banned from it.
---
Your comment will help him :) keep that bullshit to yourself please.
---
my steam library is bigger than two times your number
---
no lol
---
before anyone asks: 6 keys, 25 transmutation charges.
---
Why are you going into engineering? Do you find that super interesting and fulfilling? Many people do. They love diving deep into logical problems on computer and/or designing with CAD. 
---
Your first job, or two, or three don’t need to be fulfilling, but eventually you DO want to move in that direction.
---
I don't think there's a list anywhere, but I'd imagine it's the keys on a standard american/UK/European keyboard.
---
Let's also not forget general final fantasy nostalgia. I've had no interest in watching FFXIV before, but when they added bosses that originated from FFV and FFVI and I suddenly found myself watching some raid streams
---
You came here to talk about yourself and humiliate others? How pathetic are **YOU** mate?
---
Every person is different. Human psychology is very complicated mechanism, programmed by MANY factors throughout our lifes.  
---
You know NOTHING about this person, you don't know what did he go through in his life etc etc etc. Don't judge others based on yourself.
---
Well seems to be a very good demonstration of \[SC\] skills, very good job
---
How the hell does that even work?
---
That makes more sense, but it doesn't really explain why they can't make it happen later on. :/

---
I haven't checked what's going on with mmos in a long time but I accidentally saw Lineage is getting a remastered version and Aion is getting Aion 2 - a mobile version. I wonder if that has something to do with slashing Anet and GW2's budget in favor of those.
---
https://tenor.com/wBti.gif poor guy.
---
I am so curious now aswell.
---
What......
---
Sorry but Guild Wars 2 is not dead. Though the population is mostly casuals now days. And a large amount of those are extreme casuals. 
---
It's still alive with tons of players activity playing. I'm in a mega guild and there are constantly people playing; numbering in the thousands just for our guild. I'm pretty sure we aren't the majority of the maps players. 
---
That being said the numbers have certainly dropped due to mismanagement of the game. The lack of focus on PvP, WvW, Raids and fractles has led a lot of vets away from GW2.  
---
This all could have been prevented with simple communication and responding to concerns of vets. The lack of communication on the game's direction is a total flop. Super stupid on management's part. It leads player to believing they are lying to us like before. 
---
Even if by some miracle they have something big up their sleeve I have little hope lost players will return. The treatment of vets has left bad taste in too many mouths. 
---
There is no competitive play and the gaming community knows it. Talk has spread far and wide. With the marketing we've seen come out of Anet I doubt it can ever be fixed. 
---
Instead of proactively fixing this imagine they have kept silent. We've been at sea without a map for some time now. 
---
The devs have tried to help Anet much as possible with their limited ability to talk. Asking us to have hope and stating that there is something big coming. Sadly this is but a leaf on the wind. Anet's reputation has little to no pull now days.
---
Guild Wars 2 is not dead however. It is still a fantastic game overall. It can go another 3 years even without a single new update; if not more.The only thing that should be in question is its future direction and if it will ever become competitive. 
---
For us vet non-extreme casual players the future looks grim.
---
You must be living in a different world than I am. I'll post a group of four on LFG indicating that we're looking for alacrity and we'll get someone who asks, “Looking for DPS?” As for a more egregious example, one time we posted that we were looking for alacrity and we got a chrono. We rolled our eyes, but whatever, let's get on with it, right? No, it was a fucking power chrono.
---
why title is "HOW TO" 
---
seriou sly?
---
Never have such problems tbh, the only thing that also happens is that people join and ask if we still need dps, because sometimes so much people join at once that i cant keep up with updateing the lfg.
---
If you look at the 1st frame of the vid, you see the OP already has 100% core World Completion and is only missing this one Hero point in Grothmar.
---
I'm guessing they never opened the bouncy chests after they completed the other maps, though why the Gift of Exploration just showed up at the end.  Maybe it's a bug.
---
The OP isn't saying anything about this because there is nothing to say, nor is there anything really to see.
---
My best guess is this has to do with that free waypoint unlock thingie from gemstore.
---
&gt; I guess PvP and WvW but I don't play those
---
You answered your own questions.
---
Man these comics have sucked for the last 2 years. Improve already. Or quit making them.
---
Omg it's Ryumo again! You drew Acadia for me :)
---
Again, I'm astonished with your work, it looks absolutely incredible!! If you'd ever be open for another commission, hit me up with a PM!
---
u got an arcdps dll in your folder?
---
Which ingots are those?
---
those arguments are kinda invalid. the numbers are low because there's not much u get for playing it. nobody would raid if the rewards would suck. nobody would pvp if rewards suck. and wvw isn't pvp. its masspvp, pretty much not compareable.  
---
"certain type of player" is also those who only play pve, the very softcore'ers. thats fine. certain type are also the pvp'ers, recognizable at badges on their nicks and other visual stuff.  
---
most people play fractals i guess, but also mainly for the rewards. no other way to get the best infusions i think. 
---
i can't tell how many people really raid, but since the focus is on softcore, raids are probs amongst the thinnest populated things in this game i'd guess.  
---
yeah the maps of wvw have yet limited number of people even allowed on the maps - 40 people queues, means people that cannot enter a map bc its full isn't few exactly. do u have any clue about it, bc i kinda feel you don't from this part of your comment?
---

Downvoted...
---
You don’t take addiction seriously because if you did (as you claim) you wouldn’t be on Reddit bitching about some account...
---
You would be taking yourself to treatment!
---
Step back and look at yourself.. 
---
You sound like a crack head asking about their favorite pipe....
---
Go away, get off reddit, and get help if that’s what you need... nobody cares about your special crack pipe and maybe IF you would quit thinking, and asking, and talking, and dreaming about your super special crack pipe.. you could actually get away from said “crack”.
---
You must be young and mostly spoiled is all I can surmise.... an addict in his 40’s or 50’s would start a post instead of calling your sponsor and saying....
---
“Bro I’m thinking about that crack again.” (That’s what any REAL addict is taught to do when faced with life’s temptations)
---
SO since you got help... then call your damn help and don’t get on reddit...
---
You realize this place is full of actual trolls right?
---
This is gorgeous!!!
---
What a disingenuous post, steven hawking can't play the game either but we're not balancing around him. 
---
The game is easy, If you can't play the game due to a disability, then you can't play the game, its a sad sitiuation and I'd feel sorry for you if you weren't being so blatantly disingeuous to try and pretend people who take issue with the difficulty are somehow discriminating against you because they can't read your mind. What an incredibly rotten person you are, trying to milk your disability for an agendapost.
---
I know this is sarcasm but... it would not be the craziest thing they did accidentally.
---
Well i play ESO currently and it's far from dead, it happens some times a faction has less population so they stop playing all together turning it into a 1v1, with a huge part of the map abandoned, but it's usually pretty active
---
Thanks for putting this into perspective!
---
Sure doesn't help that it feels like anet trying its hardest to kill of the game.
---
It may have gotten stale for you, but it wouldn’t be for a new player. I just got into PvP about two years ago (picked up the game at launch, with extended breaks), and have finished a full set of legendary armor, my wings, and the final princess llama. The base gameplay of PvP is still very entertaining for me, and a new players would have thousands of good games, and goals ahead of them. It never takes more than a few minutes to queue, and most rounds end up really entertaining.
---
Hey thanks! What's a good class for solo content?
---
See you've only played a couple years, I started with PvP around launch.  The past couple years nothing has really changed other then what's the most op build and people just spam it because anet sucks at nerfing things promptly if they are way out of balance.  That's my biggest gripe with the PvP, there isn't enough balance passes to level out the playing field.  Many seasons I played it mostly came down to who had the most scourges or engineers because if they had two and you had one or none then you almost always lost.  Crap like that shouldn't stick around for months on end.
---
good luck mate hope you can save yourself.I have a suggestion if you think about "this game is dead" you can quit safe and fast (which is dead)
---
Again any.....yes there are builds that are again again "meta" for solo. But once you understand how the game works you can pretty much solo till 80 easy. 
---
I have just used the best gear I can get my hands on when leveling a toon and maybe other then event bosses and sum hero point fights (these are used to get skills unlocked) never had an issue.
---
Necro because of minions and rangers because of pets are very very good noob friendly solo classes.
---
If you are the type to learn game mechanics most classes have good solo builds.
---
Otherwise necromancer and guardian stand out as solid tanky classes.
---
Wow this is absolutely beautiful
---
Try one of these PVP builds: godsofpvp.net 
---
All the build that say 'core' can be played by F2P players.
---
Deleting a character loses, map comp, crafting,soulbound gear, dungeon and story progression, not to mention future potential bday gifts, with the later ones being really nice, I recommend against it, especially if the character has any time on it.
---
If you do reroll, salvage all the gear, clean out bags, put bags in your eith any ascended gear you had
---
I like that the last phase has the larger image though. Good job on that :)
---
pvp sucks in this game dont waste your time on this game for your sanity
---
Its kinda nice that skill is the main factor :)
---
Well, that's interesting. I appreciate your opinion! Does anyone else feel this way?
---
PBM holo skips the first two and never makes to the last one.
---
Note that the game is not free to play though. It's a buy to play game with a very generous play for free model. That being said without buying the game you will have less options that are good enough in PvP. Iirc there are only 3 meta builds in the current meta for free version players.
---
every character has their own story, plain and simple.  So if you decide to start a new character you gotta go through the entire experience all over again.  Granted you can skip HoT and go straight to PoF if you only care about getting back to Icebrood Saga asap.
---
You will lose small nods towards your character's story progression. Like if you did that story path or this story path. For example, if you didn't do the story step of choosing your mentor, the game defaults to Trahearne. So yes, you lose something. But it's minor.
---
:D this guy will be a tiger one day!! Many ppl ignored what I said because they read only the first line! 
---
I explained what I needed to explain, and this guy will defeat every challenge that cross his way! I got faith on him!
---
You'll switch around trust me :p I mostly play necro but I do play other stuff sometimes. Nothing to lose though. Only thing that you lose really is map exploration and waypoints. And also having to get new gear which more so is hard for those that don't do daily fractals and weekly raids . doing those 2 you end up with many tabs of ascended gear just sitting there
---
I love most JPs, the only ones i dont like is when you get punished to hard. E.g. NSS is a bit harsh without the rewinder, since you can die easily.
---
I love a nice jumping challenge tho.
---
*saga*
---
OMG! these are great!
---
Nah i think this is fine, that is why most JPs have a nofly/mount zone to begin with, sometimes it can take longer to probe for a cheese than doing the actual JP.
---
Sadly doing JPs usally doesnt reward you. The only "jumping title" you can get is SAB, JPs on the other hand have no such thing...
---
This is me, except I somehow manage to get more DPS on the Condi Quickbrand than I do on the dedicated Condi DPS Firebrand. Probably due to muscle memory. I've come to accept the support role.
---
That is the normal and desired reaction but sadly not the one you’ll always get. Some people are assholes.
---
revive orbs are right now
---
i dont know what mine is but in 100 cm was really low on arkk
---
Remember they're talking about sPvP and all the gripes that go with that. The game has two different PvP modes: sPvP (structured PVP - five per team capture and hold is the main formate) and WvW (World v World - Open map objective based where three 'servers' battle against each other to take objectives).
---
The only sPvP issue is not enough players at high ELO so matches often have mismatched teams skill level. Bots would be extremely rare outside of the highest ELO groupings. Both these are to keep the queue times lower. Even at high plat queue times are lower than I face in LoL as a high mid rank Jungler (I'm plat 2 in LoL, was also plat  in GW2 but in GW2 that's high ELO in LoL it's below Diamond, Master and Challenger) 
---
The game mechanics are good, balance is pretty good (in spite of whining) and the daily and monthly automated tournaments are fun.
---
Upside to playing on free account is in sPvP gear is all normalized to level 79 and your toon is also normalized to level 79. I believe it's lvl 79, might be off a level.
---
Downside to free account, I don't believe you can use any elite spec you don't have the Xpac for. So for example if you don't own HoT you can't play as a Daredevil (Thief elite) and if you don't own PoF you can't play as a Mirage (Mesmer Elite). But don't worry too much about that until you get to higher ELOs as there are lots of Core builds that work just fine and a few Meta Core builds- like Thief often is.
---
Again, you'll hear a lot of griping about sPvP on Reddit but most of that comes from players who've never stepped in the arena. Outside of player numbers most actual sPvP'ers complaints are minor.
---
Maybe they have the same emergency again and again /s
---
You didn’t have to tell me how the situation is right now, that’s literally what this whole thread is about.
---
I’m telling you that it’s not fair for you to say “don’t care about winning/losing” to people who still want to enjoy PvP. It’s easy for you to say that because you don’t even play it.
---
Also if you die once in WvW you don’t lose participation and you still get rewards. But you wouldn’t know that, it’s obvious you only play this game to make gold and not PvP other people.
---
&gt; Does anyone have a suggestion on what I can do? 
---
Asked.
---
&gt; As you can guess addicts know how they get to their stuff  
---
Answered.
---
The truth of the matter is that deleting your account will not stop you from playing. GW2 is free and another download is the obvious choice for you to make here. Even getting them to block your IP in this age of VPN's is pointless. I am afraid that, addiction being what it is, you can only do the hard yards as you have been so far.
---
Thank you! I don't know, maybe 30-40 min for sketch and then about an hour for colouring.
---
try disabling discords ingame overlay if u havent alrdy. that caused random crashes for me
---
If you download the game then... open it...? look around with your mouse, see for yourself...
---
They ignore it for long periods of time and hemorrhage players. The main thing the mode needed was more frequent balance patches. The meta for over a year was FB + Scourge + Mirage + Thief + FotM home node. If you believe they've given PvP more than lip service since PoF launched, then I don't know what to say.
---
The problem isn't the type of game. It's the frequency of updates to watchable modes.
---
I'm not the person you're replying to, but the answer's probably nothing. And by that I mean they might be mad about the fact that, storywise, we went straight from the end of All or Nothing to the beginning of War Eternal, so it felt like the end of AoN got immediately nullified by the beginning of WE. Even as someone who played both when they came out (as compared to someone literally playing them back to back), it felt like kind of a letdown.
---
Both episodes were great, of course, I just felt like they could've used something in between.
---
your account is dedicated to shit talking this game. Is there something wrong with you in the head?
---
Highly stylized stuff can look pretty in motion but ugly when you look at the details.
---
great work! love the teal highlights you chose for this, really adds to it :)
---
For the people who don't do fractals, the reason is simple.
---
Daily fractal rewards exist at each tier (1, 2, 3, 4) and they're for the same fractal, just different levels of the same fractal. So doing a T4 fractal gets you the rewards for each tier.
---
Today's highest daily only needs 122 Agony Resistance which is pretty easy/cheap to obtain. I haven't done the math but I'm sure it's cheaper than the cost of ascended armor (which you need for agony resistance anyways). You should pretty easily have the AR you need by the time you get to the higher tiers. 
---
Log in, do 3 fractals, and get 12 rewards for the daily achievements. It's super easy, quick, and actually rewarding.
---
Dont be torn, I got 28 lvl 80s, tho for different reasons. But i do replay the story, the living world and the expansions at least half a dozen times.
---
You all are incredible! I find it so ironic that your speedrunning comp actually does the McLeod colored adds mechanic when literally no one else does :D
---
How much time do you think you would have lost by insta-cc'ing KC and pushing the orb into a single rift each time?
---
It's not just spvp. Normal pvp suffers from the same issues and they both suffer from griefers and afkers too. The problem is becoming more and more obvious as people leave the game, you wouldn't see as many in a healthy game because there are a lot of normal players to dilute your experience but now that a lot of them have left, you see a lot more undesirables

If the streaming scene for GW2 was doing better, the popular GW2 streamers could grow to be big names like that. Isn't that how Asmongold, for example, got popular streaming WoW? It's not really an independent issue.

Mistake in thief rotation: oh well, a slightly lower DPS, you're still fine a second later.
---
Mistake in renegade rotation: your DPS is screwed for next 10 seconds, all energy management is fucked, important skills unavailable due to "low profession energy", panic on which one of 5 rotations you need to use now, that energy is too low but not low enough to switch correctly to other legend.  Druid's iboga laughs at you :(

Sorry to disturb again.

Can't fin on wiki or google about   [Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Extra-Pungent_Skyscale_Treat) .
---
I need to jump to near wp and use it?
---
But general question is there are 21 tasks and you said I need 17, rest 4 can't be done with that item? How can I know what exactly, again wiki don't say.
---
Thanks.
---
Dont sell your account man, just give it to me. I'm still addicted and not getting help.

Spend $20, get a code in email. You can send that code to your friend and they can enter the code into their account.
---
To expand on this, there were attempts to drive it into eSports early on, but those tournaments quickly stopped because the infrastructure just wasn't really there to support a scene. Prior to HoT, though, we had the Go4s running for a year or so with real money cash prizes on a weekly and monthly basis. Pro League was the next step from that, not the first step.

What do you mean "Pure 64-bit System"? If you mean that it still requires 32-bit libraries, that's the case with most games, even those with 64-bit binaries (for some reason).
---
That said, are you using the installer listed here: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/31192/playing-guild-wars-2-on-linux-performance-optimizations-and-more/p1](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/31192/playing-guild-wars-2-on-linux-performance-optimizations-and-more/p1)
---
Currently I get the best performance in Linux using the build that is maintained there, though me (or someone) should just create a lutris installer that installs his package and runs it.
---
Just by doing 3 dailys every day you get 2 gold. That is 60 gold on 1 month. Gather wood and sell and you should get loads of gold every day just from that. Meta events, there are several also make you gold.
---
But either way, just sell it back. Might not get it all back but a big part of it at least.
---
Guild Wars 2 devs regularly talked about how many of them were really into PvP and specifically talked about making it for esports. However, when the game launched, much like the rest of the game (the Zhaitan fight comes to mind), many aspects of it just weren't finished. Clearly they re-prioritized prior to launch, and the game launched without as heavy a PvP focus as intended. That said, it still wasn't meant to be a "casual" game. Dungeons, for example, were supposed to be quite difficult. They just got easier over time as players got more used to the combat, but that wasn't by design.
---
Bro, I never use glint shiro outside wvw roaming and pvp. If you do use it outside of that your gimping yourself as it is not the best build for other types of content. Do note that if you dont have legendary gear, weapons and trinkets  or dont have tons of ascended gear then switching builds is just alot harder.
---
Tell me how far mechanics and knowledge of fight gets you on largos.
---
lol you casuals have mental problems for sure and calling people psycho,games are fun when you play it for winning,nobody will have fun when they lose a football game,chance of winning is the thing keep you playing,go to the tango course if you want to roleplay or casually having fun, instead of complaining about your stupid campfire duration.And stop calling people toxic and mental just because they are good at game,and good players can have social life aswell.Losers.
---
They could simply add a permanent one that is rewarded from the new strike mission but you can also buy from the TP.
---
&gt; Strikes cannot be too hard or they just become really short raid boss encounters. It's an important balance
---
um... they are...
---
This response is a clear example of the lack of understanding people have about rotations.
---
The fact that you think the difference between a good thief rotation and a poor one is marginal, and the fact that you think you cannot easily recover from a slight mistake on condi renegade tells me you don't understand where rotations are developed from in the first place and only blindly follow button presses.
---
Was talking more about fractals than raids and it is just way better than chrono there and it even outdamages some dps specs thanks to super short phases. Old double chrono meta allowed more dps specs than current fb/dh stack meta. In fractals its so extreme that a single fmw is enough for each ensyl phase or fb precast is enough for siax. Nothing could probably compete with that.
---
Some builds are simple and shrug off errors, other builds are flexible enough that you can do things in the wrong order for a short while and not get too badly punished, then there are the builds implode when you don't press the right button at the right time.
---
By missions in the open field, do you mean hearts? It's not too difficult to complete most of them (so if your group wanted to do one, and someone finished early, it shouldn't take much for everyone else to catch up), and for many you can basically share progress. For instance, as long as you deal enough damage to an enemy, usually one or two hits, you'll get credit for killing it, so if everyone hits it before it dies, you should all get credit and heart progress. Plus I think some non-enemy heart things are instanced per player, so if one person fixes a fence or feeds a cow or something, everyone else still sees a broken fence or hungry cow and can fix/feed it.
---
Also, I see a lot of new players overvalue hearts. They're great for unlocking vendors with decent items for the area's level, necessary for map completion, and give decent xp. However, I often see people focusing only on the hearts and getting burnt out. You can always go do something else and come back later if you want. Maybe go explore new areas of the map, find vistas (red triangles symbol on the map), complete hero challenges for hero/skill points (yellow arrow symbol on the map), join events you come across (orange symbols on the map as well as a box appearing near the top right of your screen when you're close enough), do story missions (green vortex symbol), try to do achievements, run around randomly killing things, or just do whatever you feel like.
---
Just stop dude. Your jokes are unfunny. Your artsytle is shit. And you have no intention to improve your content by the looks of it. Taking on the average teenage wattpad user defense when someone calls you out on it. "DON'T LIKE IT DON'T READ"
---
Put in some fucking effort.
---
For gathering, achivements, events for collections, world bosses, leveling a new character, key runs, Helping a friend/guildie, helping new players by using the mentor tag and answer questions, mastery for Tyria, map completions, well that is what came on top of my head.
---
Yeah you dont play renegade do you
---
That would be really cool if Sylvari had phosphorescent patterns on their skin.
---
Rest in Holo
---
reason 1 out of 2837813782473 why renegade is a bad spec in pvp
---
Idk man, Condi Renegade is one of the easier ones to recover from, dump all energy using whatever you have available and then try to Legend swap then weapon swap, and you're back to normal.
---
"Pure 64-bit System" as in, no multilib, thus no 32bit libs at all. Had no problems so far, besides, GW2.
---
Petition to give the DPS golem a Santa hat during Wintersday.
---
Too bad. Great game, awesome open world and dungeons/fractals. But zero reasons to play the game everything that is actually appealing  is locked behind gems. With gems to gold people can easily get legendaries and ascended armor and so on. Mount skins are locked in gem store aswell. With that said streamers and youtubers have pretty limited content to show.
---
I'm fairly new to reddit as a whole. Previously I only used it to keep up with the status of Wars in Eve Online, and only recently have I branched out. Anecdotally, I've come to realize that every subreddit dedicated to something non-sex related is in a state of dismal self-loathing. It's almost as if the internet has become a nest of malcontents. Whether that is because the outside real world society has become that, or if it is a sign of generational turn-over, I cannot say.
---
Given GW2 explicitly provides 32 and 64bit binaries, I hope it's simply a mishap regarding CoherentUI\_Host.exe.
---
Hahaha oh man that last one is the best by far.
---
I mean it also takes effort to not get this mad about what someone else does with their spare time but there you go
---
What do you mean? Because they have, I drew this from my character's reference, but that parts glowing only at night or dark places and usually hidden by armour.
---
I refuse to believe that anyone who defends this is actually being serious.
---
Thank you! She had teal glowing and bright red eyes, but I've decided to make it in one colour.
---
Ranger isn’t bad for solo play since you’ll have a pet to accompany you
---
All good :) that text is genius for those who can actually understand it
---
Looks like you would enjoy the blood magic variant of power reaper.
---

---
Do you RP on US servers on Australia friendly time?
---
This isnt the right game for you
---
There’s no real gear progression per se but sometimes a new DLC includes a new stat and that becomes meta and it just takes a few days to farm what you need to change over to the new stuff 
---
As for the so called “trinity” in other games. It exists but it’s different. 
---
We have: 
---
boon support (Chronotank, diviner’s Chrono, revenants,  quickness firebrand and Boon thief), 
---
healing (scourge, druid, tempest, healing revenants, and healing firebrand,  
---
and DPS (berserker banner warriors, dragon hunters, Condi firebrand, soulbeast, Weaver, tempest, daredevils, deadeye, renegade, and Reapers. And probably a few more
---
The thing that annoyed me the most was that it was the norn who were quick to distrust the sylvari during mordremoth when they of all people had this issue not only as a social construct, but also wanted to coexist with theirs. 
---
Now they're like "ho hum, I'm gonna walk out onto the middle of the blizzard to sit under a tree and die because the dragon told me to." Like dragons killing people but now we gotta be uwu sorry for them? Pfft.
---
right! there are still people who dont trust sylvari but waa waa norns :'(
---
You must not do pug raids often.
---
Are we talking about pug raids here? If so, you're in some kind of amazing lala land with your fantasy.
---
Lead here (also hi Cerosi )- we go at pretty much random times, though it's typically in the evening our time (anywhere from 6-10 PST ). And yes, US servers. :)
---
Don't even bother attempting to reach benchmark numbers. The people that make them employ many tricks that you may not know about:
---
- Weapon stowing to cancel animations
---
- Special positioning to hit the golem more times than you would usually
---
- Using different number and assortment of buffs and boons for every benchmark, they you might not have noticed without watching the video
---
- Some builds benefit from having party members around you, which is also not always obvious even when watching the video if you don't know about trait intricacies
---
- Many builds rely on infusions to cap important stats like Precision, Condition Duration, Boon Duration. Without having the exact same number of +stat infusions as in the build but using the gear and consumables from the build - you will suffer. You would need to adjust stats on gear or use a different food. Thankfully SC now have a gear optimizer that can do the dirty work for you
---
I mean, you can have a free account. Assuming that's what they have, they'd lose nothing but time in downloading the game
---
I am enjoying A Whisper in the Dark, but this is one thing I found annoying? I loved the whispers to Sylvari in HoT, but doing it again here came across as lazy and cheapens it in both uses.
---
Original post was changed to make me sound like a dick, ultimate power move yo

lulw
---
I don't know. The opening to War Eternal established how shaken everyone was by believing that &gt;!Aurene was dead, how much could have been gained in wallowing in that to longer before her inevitable resurrection?!&lt; 
---
Plus War Eternal already had a lot going on, and they probably wanted to get to the new map relatively early. 
---
I do think that this is an area that their move from Episodes to Sagas could be a benefit though, because with Episodes they do want to reach the new maps early, it's frustrating when the patch drops and it could take a large chunk of story before you even get access to the new map, but with Sagas I believe they have the flexibility (if they choose to use it) to drop pure story content into the game outside of "full episode" releases, so that when the episode drops you *can* get on to the new map almost immediately, but a week or two before that you can follow up on story beats that take place on existing maps, but fall outside of the "big finale" to the previous episode.
