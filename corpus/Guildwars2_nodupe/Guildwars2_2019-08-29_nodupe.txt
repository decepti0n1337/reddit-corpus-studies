While i appreciate the well thought out post, I was mostly taking the piss out of the irony calling races besides human - in GW2 no less- boring.
---

---
Like have you seen FFXIV's racial selection? barring Hrothgar it's human, wide human, tall human, short human, human with cat/rabbit ears, and spiky human.
---
---
---
I never had pc password neither on my desktop or laptop
---
Get that jerk locked up.
---
druids bring might, fury, regeneration, spirits, and a unique buff called spotter, and on top of that, they bring healing. 
---
The trinity isn't really a thing here, we have a set up of DPS and supports primarily, where the supports bring buffs, condition cleanses, blocks, etc, and healing.
---
"8 guesses". 
---
If people have noticed by now, he knows whats going on, 8 guesses is such a random number, most people would pick 10. 
---
Some of this is true, some of this is bull.
---
Simple, you still have access to everything(except the special mecanic, f abilities for guardian) that the base class had when you pick an elite spec.
---
Dont know where you got that info from, but elite spec dont change your class nearly as much as you seem to think it does. Sure the style of gameplay change but its silly to complain about MORE content when you still have access to everything you had before...
---
I'm sorry that my passing comment on the internet came off as a personal attack on your character. In the future I'll try to refrain from making jokes , about a game I'm not even playing, in the presence of those who may not understand them.
---
Playing a game while your SO is yelling at you will never end well. Log out, talk it out, and structure your free time to not cause these kinds of issues.
---
I disagree strongly with the notion of applying the framework of abusive relationships to public company &lt;-&gt; customer relationships.
---
Yes, there's people behind the company. Absolutely none of them deserve abuse on a personal level, and hitting them during a Twitch stream (while, sadly, to be expected) is gross.
---
Putting an entire company on the level of a private person in an abusive relationship comparison is disingenuous at best and harmful to discussing the issues at play at worst though.
---
I believed in you. I always have.
---
They're also an increased variety of play that applies to all game modes.  GW2 desperately needs that right now.
---
&gt; You can salvage food now
---
Did you hear that [RMX], [RmX], and [rMx]? You bank guilds are gonna get cashed out this month!
---
PoF was huge, what are you talking about
---
I legit think that sometimes ANet employees go like that. They see a forum or reddit topic about dungeons and be like "Wait, what? Since when does this game hav- Oh! Oh yeah, lol"
---
Casino coins could be consumed for PoF mastery experience. The note suggests consuming them all allows you to get all your experience at once, instead of clicking each one.
---
What're you gonna do? Send Regional Manager Darth Maul?
---
Im really hoping they dont just plan to continue doing living world. I think they need another expansion at some point. The problem is idk if they have the means to do it
---
Seems like the glyph of crucible, good RNG and the gardens in Drytop and Mount Maelstrom (if you made the legendary longbow) might be a good daily routine for a while.
---
If you're on EU feel free to add me - Arsene.3568, online during evening hours :)
---
i actually brought both glyphs to the dry top farm and didn't really get anything good out of the cactus, carrot, and lettuce. the cabbage nodes in the dry top farm are the only thing that can convert into mint seeds
---
Given the expectations I have seen in some of the posts the past two weeks..... I foresee a lot of rage and disappointment but mostly rage that people won't get the crazy things people want.
---
Tempest in fractals because of easy access to stability, strong mid range dps and stun breaks. For general pve you can play around with different builds.
---
&gt;simply because it can't possibly please everyone
---
I mean, people who expect this are *really* naive. There's no way this could happen.
---
That's actually Kokoro with her hat on. You can see Gonbe and Chimney in front of her.  The skeleton hasn't made an appearance by this episode yet.  (Episode 312)
---
Don't take it literally. I meant groups of players who are cattered by certain game modes for example.
---
HoT too. Mordremoth's theme was playing some minutes ago.
---
Exactly. I'm keeping a clear head.
---
Sure we don't know about the real situation, but you surely don't break in your ex home to destroy everything out of spite just because your exgf don't want to go to the nightclub. She could go out alone too if she wanted that so badly, you don't need to do every thing as a couple, she could also made concession : dl gw2 because it's free and play with him. We also don't know if Op was always the one doing concessions. 
---
I think we always trust female victim on abuse account but always try to debunk or dismiss male victim, as if it was less serious. If gender were reversed the ex would already be arrested.
---
Also, as an introvert, going to the nightclub is one of the worst thing I can think of after pulling off my nails with a plier.
---
As someone who can relate for the exact same situation earlier in my life I naturally tend to trust Op because what he said sound credible to me.
---
But, while I agree on the premise to always doubt when we have a one sided story, even if it's a crime, I mean especially if it's a crime ; it was not the point of my comment.
---
My point was, when someone is upset you don't want to escalate things, if nothing works, just ignore. It can quickly slip into domestic violence. And as a man, you don't want to get into a domestic violence case. I mean nobody want, but if you want to be recognized victim of a domestic abuse by your female partner as a male, ha ! Fat chance ! Especially when you had to defend yourself.
---
Pretty interesting what they did get right (sun's refuge more or less). Almost all of the season 4 leaks in that first thread were wrong though, so I'll take it with a grain of salt.
---
I'm one of those weirdos that finds the underwater stuff interesting though, so I keep hoping they'll take another look at it. It's not as far from good as a lot of people make it out to be in my opinion.
---
Well yeah, that's what I meant. One group is going to be disappointed.
---
It's just a living world episode, what's with the doom and gloom? We all know what to expect from a living world episode :/
---
Afaik the humans are invaders from another land. Ascalon used to be charr territory before the humans occupied it.
---
Literally none of those season 4 predictions were correct, beyond the predictable confrontation with Kralkatorrik, which we knew would happen from the PoF epilogue. 
---
Why is that an indication to you that this guy knows anything?
---
The issue with that though is any content that gets put in there instantly turns into shit because random instabs exist
---
Unless they drastically change the format, this would be a pretty hard pass from me. Living World episodes are already pretty stale. 1 new map, same basic format with a new map currency to grind endlessly, maybe a fractal or something on the side. Expansions are what keep me playing, because they've changed up the gameplay style drastically each time.
---
The lifesteal has an icd of 2 seconds and is similar to lifesteal from Vampiric Presence, afaik
---
Sounds like both of you were neglecting/abusing each other
---
Really hope not, but it does look that way
---
&gt; all raids get a Dungeon Mode.
---
If they could retain their difficulty and rewards this would be the single biggest QoL update the game ever got. A lot of other MMOs have scaling raids except for us. That is limiting a huge portion of the game.
---
What is going on with those objects?

&gt;* Fixed a bug that could prevent the third home instance garden node from being unlocked by the Black Lion Garden Plot Deed.
---
&gt;* Ascended feasts can now be used in raids.

---
Exactly. 2012 dungoens can't be "fixed" or "patched" so, if I were at ANet and wanted to make bringing this shoddy content up to speed, the best way to do that is to basically make them "raids". Also, I love Fractals, and I hear people say that Fractals can be everything dungeons are and more, but they will never feel like a proper replacement to dungeons because of their weird lore. Dungeons are physical locations locked in time/space where players go on an extended journey. Fractals are small fragments existing out of sync with time where players can go on condensed journeys. There's space for both. What I think is silly is the distinction between dungeons and raids. Raids are just harder dungeons. They needed to be harder because powercreep over the years made dungeons largely trivial to anyone who did the content.
---
Also, the community has been asking for difficulty levels for years now. The casuals want raids easier. Teh hardcorez want it harder. Porque no las dos?
---
^ and *this*, kids, is how you give constructive negative feedback.
---
Yeah. I think I had a venom laying around (or maybe crafted and sold it sometime, and bought a new one for this), and they heavily buffed Necro trident skills (now half of them cast the auto-attack several times at the target, so heavy bleeding fast). Since I only had a shitty rare trident I ended up deciding to make Kraitkin.
---
I’m wondering if we could see season passes like Destiny. We pay a fee and get access to the new larger living world content for the season. Something like a hybrid of paid expansions and the living world seasons.
---
These "leaks" happened after Sun's Refuge and the armour had already been talked about by Anet themselves.
---
Frankly this is a living story anouncement, and has been explicitly advertised as such. Expecting major announcements regarding Pvp, raids and wvw is setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Weirdchamp
---
I hate cilantro so much.  My stomach is actually churning just seeing THAT WORD.
---
&gt; thats like trying to make Tequatl a Raid.
---
You technically could. If you scaled Teq to a 5 man it would be something like: 2 people on turrets, 1 person on a defense team while 2 DPS teq. If anything you could make it *more* complex with new mechanics each person needs to do, like Marionette.
---
Yeah. Disappointment
---
If thats true then fuck him, this is just click bait.
---
That's the thing, we don't know! Were they working on GW3? Or were they working on new IPs and just wanted to sunset GW2? You know, if we ARE going to Jormag next, some beautiful poetry in narrative would be for us to end our GW2 journey by building a new wing onto the Eye of the North Hall of Monuments where we then collect things to carry over into a Guild Wars 3!
---
they don't, but thats the people they're catering to. Same people that say why should we go to new specs when the old ones are just established and good and so on...
---
&gt; There is so much hype and expectation going into it that I can't help but feel that a good chunk of the playerbase will be disappointed, regardless of how good it is.
---
That's probably the case when we look at this sub an see people speculating about new especs, a new expansions, console adaption and even more. 
---
However, if we keep in mind that only ~5% of a game's playerbase actively write stuff in forums, it won't be a good chunk of the whole playerbase. Maybe a good chunk of that 5%, but that's it.
---
TL;Dr
---
OP stuck his dick in crazy.
---
He admitted to knowing stuff about expansions, at the end of the day content creators are part of the Anet PR machine when it comes to new content. 
---
Its been 7 years and you haven't noticed?
---
Fractals are cool but I for one like having a location on a map that’s an actually place to visit and is alil longer then fractals, fractals are just so quick they don’t have substance in my opinion
---
Y'know, gonna take this opportunity to mention that I really hope charr models get a rework. Seriously... look at some of the new mount skins, like that fox-raptor. Finely-detailed fur, muscle/tendon/subsurface shading, *freaking specular wrinkliness on the lower lip.* The painstaking attention to detail that you can only see if you pull the camera in until it's almost clipping through the model makes the charr sitting on it look... almost goofily outdated by comparison.
---
ANet's creature artists are spectacularly talented. But I'd give anything to see them go back and give some of that new love to the old models.
---
Please add them to the wiki!
---
Pretty sure it was more golden than that.
---
guess the casino coin glitch is a little more complicated
---
If anyone gives you that immature of an ultimatum, then you have to go against them. Shit like that isn't healthy. It really has nothing to do with the game. You didn't feel like going out, and she was forcing you to. So much so that she left with an ultimatum. Good for you getting out, hope you can get your account back.
---
You get a plot as part of the new chef related achievements where you go around learning stuff from the different races. 
---
The plot is from the sylvari section.
---
The charr section gets you the new meat drops.
---
Asura to make the food salvager
---
Human just gets you a different looking stove.
---
Not sure what if anything you get from the norn ...
---
You can't whisper me, because I haven't added. YOu can not whisper ANYONE. You'd have had to give your name here to me, not in game. That's the point. If you could just whisper anyone and you were a gold seller, the limitation would have no teeth, see?
---
I'm with you, especially because I'm feeling LW maps are super hollow in comparison with xpac maps.
---
A clash / team up between Jormag and Bubble.
---
What seems the most likely is expansion like content in the form of free LS updates.  Everything is pointing to going into some snow region in the north.  Build templates coming first with episode 1 along with a new map and story that hits the ground running.
---
What deters me from thinking that way is why they feel a need to do a live event for it.  That makes me then think that something bigger is coming.  Maybe they changed their minds and there will be another expansion.
---
Either way, I hope its big and shakes everything up.  Give me hype, Anet!
---
the button to consume all for casino coins wasnt in game even though its in the patch notes
---
Honestly he's not even a shitty person, he just handled a shitty situation. 
---
He even said something to that effect in another comment thread. It's amazing to me how many people are getting so up in arms about the insinuation that OP messed up too.
---
Yes I saw the wiki but in my memories it was more glowy when shooting. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
Will do. But not sure if your evening hours are the same as mine :))
---
I remember a patch where they claimed to have at least made his AI less awful, HM might be a different story lol
---
The personal story had a lot of downs.... Mostly in the execution, but I think most of us can agree that the mentors were some of the better parts...
---
And while Tybalt gets so much love, probably because most of us GW1 vets recognise the Order of Whispers, the other two mentors are pretty memorable on their own... Despite the Priory one having a generic face....
---
That's the entire reason that, to this day, I've done Mad King's Clock Tower exactly once for those boots. I don't mind falling and redoing, but I DO mind having to wait to try again.
---
Nah man, your points were amazing. I went into this almost entirely uncritical of Rurik, but you really opened my eyes to the gray area. Rurik is his father's son in a few ways, and I hadn't really noticed that until today. You're right, without the context of history, Rurik's actions really are just as questionable, if not more so, than those of Adelbern.
---
Damn, ANet made a surprisingly complex story for that. It's a lot less clear-cut than I remembered.
---
True but the maps are overall way way worse... :(
---
If they can't balance right, what makes you think they can balance wrong?
---
This the new Stranger Things season?
---
Yeah I got. But I’m in the EU server
---
Way to try bringing useless unrelated drama here. Gotta farm that karma.
---
Maybe OP means the character bouncing up and down on the mount??? 
---
Maybe it is the mount rubbing against the rock??? 
---
We will never know what went through OP head to make this thread
---
Probably, but considering the situation resulted in a breakup, you really think that was the right call to make in a relationship?
---
True, but in this case WP as always been quite critical to Anet when needed.
---
i got a invisible boots box and selected the heavy one. I sold it for 2750g and bought incinerator from tp.
---
Not fully agreeing; mounts make it easy to cheese the puzzle while for own portals you need to first reach the point where you can lay them. Additionally, portals from others add a layer of cooperation that mounts cant :D
---
I don't really want new elite specs until they do a comprehensive rework of a bunch of the existing specs... but that's an **18 spec** rabbit hole I'm not sure I want to dive into right now.
---
God some of the guys in there chatting are douchbags
---
Thanks for looking but no, it wasn't that :)
---
Winter is coming.
---
Aw, why not? GW2's snowy environments are some of the most beautiful in the game imo, and I hate snowy stuff IRL. Plus it'll be right on-season with Autumn and Winter coming up. :B
---
It's a feature that's locked behind buying the Expansions, unfortunately. Type /map in chat, and now you can talk/ chat for the entire map you currently in.
---
It isn't. What step does the achievement panel say you are on? 
---
The final step you wait in your home instance while he very very slowly delivers your oven.
---
I agree, the news has to involve elite specs to be of any relevance.  Though, being that we are within 2 days of the announcment and there hasn't been any egregious leaks of spec information yet, then I'm thinking there isn't any.
---
I still give it an honest few goes every year hoping to get those 25 AP I'm missing, but it's like fine-tuned to make me wait exactly long enough that my muscle memory can't kick in. I'm glad there are people who can farm it, but all the guides and encouragement in the world haven't helped me. I think I got lucky the one time I made it.
---
My best loot from non blc was a precursor, The Moot I believe.
---
From blc best was probably one of the home instance nodes
---
Because of the option to do so ?  
---
To keep the game fresh ?  
---
To let people do what they want ?  
---
To try something new ?  
---
To have fun ?  
---
I'm not sure where to end the list, do you want it alphabetically or numerically? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
EX: Some people really enjoy the base mechanics of mesmers, but some people want a small change, you change specs. This way you dont need to abandon the entirety of the gameplay you enjoy in favor or an entirely different class
---
Its like saying "well there is ONE class that matters, and its the Condi class, so we need 1 tank, 2 druids, and 7 of that one class". Just - No.
---
&gt; they don't, but thats the people they're catering to 
---
I dont get this statement. Wot? You're telling me, the people who are still learning their rotations are being catered to by Anet - who are releasing new specs so....they can learn another set of rotations?
---
\&gt; Slashed the tires of my bike
---
Ouch.
---
\&gt; broke everything made out of glass
---
That bitch cray cray.
---
\&gt; TOOK my freaking dog
---
TIME TO GO JOHN WICK ON THIS BITCH
---
What colour was the string; are you sure it was a longbow / which profession used the bow?
---
I think elite specs were their way of doing secondary professions without the balance nightmare.
---
Gives me some Paul Ruskay vibes. I dig it.
---
The string was white or gold. I'm not sure it was a longbow and I don't know the profession. It was in Dry Top, maybe the map has some kind of special bloom or reflection and it was indeed the Luminous Arc and it appeared brighter than it was.
---
Soule compsed all of the core game's [music](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soundtrack). You're probably listening to his work every time you play.
---
Not disagreeing with you but the community being clear!?
---
Oh man, I definitely shouldn't have opened this at work! I'm so embarrassed now.
---
Norn doesn't seem to give you anything at all
---
Sylvari unlock some seeds to drop from plant nodes, the recipe for the food salvager and a Garden Plot  
---
Charr unlock the new meats to drop  
---
Human and Asura improves your home kitchen  
---
So you basically want to do the Sylvari and Charr quest line as soon the possible. Also, each questline gives you 10 levels in cooking and unlock some new recipes.
---
That was a nice quick bug fix for ascended feasts in raids. Much appreciated. :)
---
That was quick and I very much appreciate it. Looking forward to feasting on the next raid night.
---
Very subtle hinting at the real Final Big Boss of the series-- SPACE DRAGON :V
---
They stress at every turn that *only* Elder Dragons can consume and process magic on that scale, so if we do get anything besides Aurene they would have to be dragons too. Pale tree might qualify, but I don't think we have anyone besides her.
---
Personal guess? Caithe is how it's going to happen. Aurene will be "connecting" with people to make them champions, and the order of the crystal bloom will be her take on dragon minions and dragon champions. They will spread out and collect/process/feed magic to her so she can balance and distribute it all, in what is effectively a purified process of how Elder Dragons work.
---
Low effort karma farming drama post = report, go be a mindless drone somewhere else. 
---
And no, I have the game muted so I don't hear his work.
---
I'm the guy everyone hates when it comes to ridiculous luck.
---
2K hours, multiple ascended boxes, multiple ascended trinkets in WvW, 3 Teq hoards, 2 Wurm armors, The Legend, Dawn, Howl, 2 100g+ BLC weapon skins from map keys. Despite it all, I never bothered to get a legendary.
---
Rarely played on https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cwqkjk/its_the_final_countdown/, but it could also be an unused track
---
Istan and Dragonfall get way more play time from community then all PoF maps combined (just my teory)
---
Totally not named after the GW character. I'm putting 60-40 odds on this.
---
Died a total of 0 (zero) times in nearly 8K hours of play? Is that all PvE?
---
I got one of the new seeds tonight in drytop, but don't recall from which node.  I also got some seeds from the artichoke farm in Strait of Devastation.  The glyph of crucible is RNG dependent, so I am approaching it as a numbers game and focusing on node farms at least for now.
---
and they get in the way of my oyster farm.
---
No in GW2. :S. Almost certain it was ingame GW2 somewhere, but not on my friends list and IDK what gamemode cos i play all.
---
&gt; Yeah my joke didn't land, thanks for pointing it out
---
Your joke didn't blow over very well
---
Wasn't that Kralkatorrik in season 4?
---
For all we know it's the fifth weekend in a row he's been "too tired" to go out and just plays games lol
---
Though that doesn't excuse breaking into his house and deleting characters
---
No god no. Not my spicy cookie and nougat combo..I've been using them for years!
---
Whichever exec is ordering this policy needs to accept responsibility and change it.
---
that's exactly my reasoning, as well. several rolls at potential herb drops is better than combing the maps for herb nodes which still might not roll the right drops
---
No idea. But I'm often helping people if they ask for help in map chat. My friends list is ridiculous.
---
I really doubt you didn't die once, that's the only part of this story I don't believe. lmao
---
6 years and ~4k hours my biggest drop was Dusk on the champ train in Frostgorge Sound. I haven't had any notable drop recently.
---
The majority of players are happy spamming autoattack and getting loot, it seems like. It would be interesting to see what would happen if they nerfed easy open world rewards and encouraged players to attempt harder content. Like if some of the harder PoF metas gave a significant amount more rewards (proportional to how much effort you need to put in to succeed) than 1111 maps. Although I guess then comes the "toxicity" argument of having to police your squad for free-riders in open world content (which appears to be the majority according to the stats).
---
See, this is exactly what I meant. But you do you.
---
Forgal is still my favorite, I miss norn dad.
---
I will try. I plan to do it next week when prices have settled and bugs fixed. Most will be on the wiki by then, but having a *another* recording is extremely valuable for confirmation.
---
Thank will look into a build for it, thx!
---
Do you suggest power or condi for fractals?
---
18k hours on my main account.  Best open world drop for me was a Chak Egg Sac, which I sold for 10K (I did not know about using a middle man and trading for legendaries worth more than 10k, which was an option I learned about just after my sale).  
---
I just recently got a permanent bank access from the BLC after years of key farming on 2 accounts, which I kept because I never got around to buying one.
---
Yes I do, yes I do.
---
You're too stupid to understand how twisted of a view you got on the discussion, so I don't really need any advice from you.
---
But for your information, my "condescending" side came from people being condescending right after posting something that had already been said multiple times, it's like talking to a wall, but that's what I should have expected from the reddit hivemind.
---
Anyways, off you go, there are memes to upvote.
---
I'm surprised people find elite specs this important. For me, elite specs are meaningless without content. A new spec to play means very little if I'm still running around the same maps doing the same things.
---
Guest appearance by Wooden Potatoes would hit the mark
---
You take this upvote, dumb adelburn still makes me laugh.
---
Fair, but it just sounded like you were providing evidence that it's for that big payoff that rarely happens, and then said the opposite.
---
You certainly have a lot of hours. I've been playing on and off since early access 7 years ago, and have just over 2k hours.
---
Well, that's...what people do metas for, the loot.  I doubt people farmed GH for days because they keenly felt like Amala was an exciting and engaging fight.
---
I just said you dont need story or lore to Raid or CM to be good. Its literally not neccesary living story missions are the exact opposite and they are some of the most boring content in this game, you cant even die during them. Its designed to not fail.
---
That was my bad, I let the SSL certificate expire (it was only an April Fools joke after all, didn't think people would still be sharing it). Should be working again.
---
&gt; If they announce a new expansion with new specs and new maps and essentially that's it, more or less the same as PoF, will people be satisfied?
---
I won't be. I wasn't very impressed with the previous expansions. Going into the HoT, I was expecting a full storyline, much like what we saw with GW1 expansions. Scourge also wasn't fun to play at all because of the awkward mechanics of expecting the class to be highly mobile, but also forced to drop wells in the process, with no real way to generate more life force short of being in a zerg. And, what's up with all the Elonians speaking New Krytan?
---
Eh, roaming was fun until mounts. As for staff weaver, yea I do switch to it for defense. If you self stack 25 might with some quickness and invis, you can wipe people easily especially if you know raid rotation. Problem is dying to retal lmao.
---
Living World Season 5 Episode 1 "The Sounds Ice"
---
I'm not sure if it's possible to complete it in another character without the chef discipline. But If that's the case one of the characters will receive 10 levels, be it the one you begin the quest or the one that doesn't have the chef discipline, still that is just my speculation.
---
As of this moment, 196 people are watching the timer and it is the highest of the gw2 twitch page.
---
They function the exact same way as the other normal plant nodes.
---
Um did you link the wrong pictures or something?  The top pic looks like the model of a shield from MoP, the bottom pic has absolutely nothing to do with the post.
---
And how are raids different?  Xera was cool because of her white mantle story.  Not because she's deeply fun to fight.  Dhuum is cool because he's a god of death.  Without him being a god of death, his chair is just another overblown skin that's gemstore quality.  No story means the skins aka only reason to raid etc are pointless.
---
Hell NM fractals draw was the Caustic skins.  Guess why? Cause the Court is awesome.  Otherwise they're kinda purplish and meh.  NMC connection made them a must-have.
---
Power is always preferred in fractals because of the quick phases. Sword dagger Weaver is the best dps class, but extremely squishy and fast paced.
---
Well, in comparison to HoT maps basically.
---
PoF maps are more barren/worse than LS maps, larger and more spread out.
---
I’ve always wondered what value home instance nodes offer. I guess if you have enough alts, anything is worth the gold
---
Either it turns out to be HoT 2.0 hype, or this is all a plan to reinvigourate the salt mining industry
---
I think the second pic is from undertale, where the souls characters are drawn out. What that means in relation to the shield I don’t know though.

Home instance nodes are once per day per account.  You would need alt accounts to get multiple harvests per day.  Mostly just there to get a few extra crafting mats with close to zero effort.
---
Surprised they didn't just go straight to legendary food... "Legendary gift of shitting sparkly shiny skritts" cost 20,000 of x mat automatically mat costs 5g each
---
Seems a whole lot like wah my game is spaghetti code and my job's hard, doesn't seem like developers of other companies make that many excuses on why they suck so bad at basic shit. 
---
This goes back for years now like not even testing a fail state with a way point in a fractal, so don't give me that shit. Ideas and implementation are irrelevant if you cant even run a basic checklist of shit to look for such as checking the fail state lol. Games would get alot better if people would stop making excuses for multi million dollar companies especially when they do shit even indie devs wouldnt.

When they switched to dragonhunter, they CHOSE to use the dragonhunter weapon and the dragonhunter utilities. You don't need to use these though, even as dragonhunter ALL of your core guardian weapons and skills are still available
---
In fact, from a DPS perspective, playing as a dragonhunter but not using the longbow is actually better, which means you still use core guardian skills
---
Same with druid, you unlock the ability to use a staff and you unlock the ability to use new utility skills, but whether or not you equip them is entirely up to you. You are not required to equip any of the new utilities or weapons when you choose an elite spec, you still have the entire arsenal of weapons and utility skills that you had before you switched available to you. 
---
So when you select an elite spec, you get a new weapon choice, and you get 5 new utility skill choices, but that's all they are, choices. You don't lose the base kit
---
Was there a spare key in the house?  Spare keys to anything?  They probably should be considered compromised at this point.  It was breaking in this time, but with the same locks, it may well be unlocking the door next time.
---
The POF reveal video was 22 minutes long, and it included mounts, story, and elite specs.
---
I guess.  I just don't see what's fun about the actual fight.  As I said, take the story away and there's no hook.  That's the reason I've quit other games.  Like yawn, this boring instance with fat giant monsters we have no reason to fight.  It's just there, I guess.  Oh look, it's a building full of exactly the same monsters, why are we here?  Oh, that one's taller, now we're done.  What did we accomplish?  Cool, nothing at all?  Well, that was a waste of time.
---
It's the same for every game.  Even Dark Souls is more fascinating for its story than its combat.
---
I support much of what's been said already. Sounds like a narcissistic BPD type. Sure, ignoring a partner isn't great. Ignoring the 5 year old having a tantrum, on the other hand...
---
Idk why you getting downvoted. Given the limited context I'm in agreement with you.
---
Yes, I can confirm that it works the way it did before the patch. :)
---
Thank you.
---
Well were goingbto have to disagree for me living story episodes are the most boring content this game has to offer. They essentially act as intersctive cutscenes for all intents and purposes but if thats what you find fun by all means go ahead. I just dont want other people to waste their time thinking that Anet is going to properly develop their other game modes

---
Memes aside though, the entire conflict got a nice extra level of depth and greyscale with that reveal of Charr being there first. I especially love the meta angle, where GW1 vets scream it belongs to humans because too much time has passed for it to belong to the Charr, but its been 250 years since they took it back in GW1 so the argument is flipped on its head against them.
---
It's actually a really well crafted conflict with no clear "right side" and I wish we got to see more of that conflict. Would kill for a proper Ebonhawke borne NPC to represent how bitter Ascalonians are, and for some Charr NPC to debate them all the time. Alas.
---
Thanks
---
Seconded!
---
Extremely controvertial statement, but I'll be brave enough to say it: 
---
Its ok to be white.
---
&gt;Let's be honest here: they could announce literally everything the community has ever wanted and there would still be people who found a way to be disappointed by it.
---
You say this as if there hasn't been predictable outrage about 2 years between every expansion pack due to content drought.
---
Been playing since about 3yrs now logged in for 3,995hrs. My last big drop was the invisible boot box and selected the most expensive one and sold it, netted around 2700g and it was probably a little under a year ago, then again not sure could be more, didn't noticed I had gotten it till I started to open all my bags/boxes since I hoard them till I need more space :p
---
Umm no? For pve there is plenty to do after 80, you work for leggy, world completion,  achievements, fractals and meta events. 
---
If you do pvp and wvw you would pretty much know how stagnant it has been. Last major change they introduced in wvw was months back with warclaw and before that don't even ask. 
---
The meta in the game modes has remained pretty much the same as well so yes it has been stagnant for people who do those mode hours daily. 
---
Or did you mean endgame pve and two other pvp modes and made a typo?
---
I was introduced to it in 2014 by a guy I was dating! I played a bit on his account as he showed me the ropes (fell in love with charr) but didn't have the money to buy it then. 
---
I forgot about for another year or so and then really got into in 2015 (particularly memorable was my first time experiencing SAB) and got one of my friends into it too! it was how we kept in contact for awhile after we graduated college
---
I wish I had learned about it sooner. I watched Angry Joe’s review like 3-4 years ago. I’m not a really a fan of Angry Joe, but his enthusiasm for the game sold me.

Had a 14-Day demo key for Guild Wars Prophecies in a local PC magazine around the time factions came out.. Enjoyed all the GW1 xpacs back then (especially EotN), even though I did not play on a regular Basis.. Well, this changed when GW2 came out :D
---
On Saturday.
---
Gw2 Ded game. But I returned to it
---
oh and also, I used boosters.
---
My craziest Idea: Regular PvE Content that doesnt suck and ongoing class balance for competitive Gamemodes.. and, you know, actual "Guild Wars" :D
---
Halloween is just around the corner.... huh huh huh .....
---
That was a bug when they introduced the Skritt Knife gang.
---
Gnashblade was required to be added back, because they were selling a gemstore item that had a mini quest tied to it, and Gnashblade triggered it.
---
Without him it was basically false advertising. The 'lore' explanation was a nice little cover story.

Read about guild wars online at like gamespot and ign when I was a teenager. Looked fun, but our home computer sucked so I assumed I couldn't play it. Tried it at a friend's house for a good 30-40 minutes after it released and knew I needed to play the game, but still assumed I wouldn't be able to. 
---
A few months later Factions came out, and I was reading the back of the box and looked at the specs and realized the minimum were WAY more reasonable than I realized, so I got it, and have gotten every release in the series day one since. Eventually went back and got prophecies too, but I don't think I ever actually finished the campaign for it tbh. I think I never beat thunderhead keep.

---
Ah got it
---
Is vendor food available still?
---
I'd like to see the game get a native Vulkan backend because the performance of the current is absolutely horrible, even with a GTX1080 or above.  You can use the D9VK wrapper but an official means would be much better in the longrun.
---
I feel like this will be at the end of a cutscene on Friday. Maybe at the climax showing Jormag or some massive teaser.
---
I hope it finishes with a pile of snow being blasted by flame followed by a drop by the camera into the ocean and an entire season under water is announced.
---
Are you me? I think I was actually 13, almost 14, but I just got a laptop for Christmas and I wanted to get a game for it and came across Prophecies in a Circuit City while looking for a medieval game. The warrior in plate armor shooting a bow at a bone dragon had me instantly sold on it (as did the lack of a sub fee). Good times!
---
Played GW1 in high school because I was too poor to pay a sub for WoW, which is what all my friends played. Ended up liking the art *much* better than WoW and loved the game.
---
I remember being super hyped for GW2, watching all the build up to release, the teaser trailers and such.
---
But then I graduated high school and went to college, and all I had was a crappy laptop that was a glorified word processor, and I was doubly poor now on my own. No video games for me for years. Kind of forgot about Guild Wars.
---
Now I'm working on my PhD and I just sort of remembered the game, and googled it on a nostalgic whim almost two years ago. To my surprise is was free to play now! Still have a crappy laptop but this one *barely* meets the requirements so it works! Slightly less poor now so I got the expacs during one of the Friendship sales and grinded out gold for the LW seasons, luckily I came in right as S4 was starting so that worked out nicely.
---
Having a blast, this game is gorgeous!
---
They won't spoil the plot, so they'll only give us a premise of the story going further, mainly focusing on the first 5 minutes of Episode 1.
---
There's bound to be a 5 minute trailer, and 5 minutes of hyping (at least) before going into the real meat of the announcement. I say it'll likely be about 10 minutes of Season 5, another 5 minutes of hyping (or interspacing hype), then covering other things like what comes after Season 5 (expansion confirmation, for example), major features upcoming (basically expanding on and updating that April "What's Next" blog post), and if theories right, announcing a mobile game (which would take the meat of the second half).
---
If it was **just** Season 5, they wouldn't make such a huge announcement.
---
Even more pointless reply
---
I should have enough grandmaster marks,  wvw skirmish tickets and materials for a set of legendary armor.
---
How should I use the grandmaster marks towards making a medium set of legendary armor?
---

---
In open world content that doesn't matter? Sure. Everywhere else in PVE? Nope, not as far as Longbow Ranger anyways.
---
Back when wow was in production (so like 2004?), I was hyped (as a long time Warcraft 2 and 3 fan).
---
My brother told me that another online game made by some of the original team behind Warcraft games was coming out soon as well. Looked into it (guild wars 1) and got it instead of WoW (despite the later release).
---
Ended up loving it and getting all 3 campaigns on release, expansion on release and beta tested/early accessed GW2.
---
You said some people would never be happy, as if there aren't predictable long periods between expansions where we see large parts of the community unhappy due to lack of content. It's not being unreasonable, they have hardly added anything to the game this year.
---
Technically they said it's about the future of GW2, and that Season 5 will be covered.
---
Unless Season 5 truly is expansion stuff in a LW, they won't have enough meat to cover 45 minutes, even if they do an extra long trailer and a good 10 minutes of nothing but hyping the crowd.
---
Also, last year's announcement was saying no expansion *immediately following Season 4.* Nothing's been said about post-Season 5, because at the time they hadn't scoped out that far ahead.
---
I wouldn't write off Jormag and Primordus just yet; they may have been temporarily taken out of the picture in S3, but that probably isn't going to end up permanent, and with all the hints ANet has been dropping over the last few months I think it's safe to say our adventure will be taking us into Svarnir territory before too long.
---
Secondary Professions are an interesting idea, but they don't really fit into the design architecture of GW2 very nicely. There's just too many problems with how they would be implemented to avoid strange (or overpowered) interactions, and the end result would probably be disappointing for everyone involved if the devs decided to brute-force them in. The best possible compromise is eventually getting enough Elite Specs to achive essentially the same result, although that's decidedly a long-term goal unless ANet decides to go ham on adding new Specs for some crazy reason (which would be cool, but probably not the wisest of ideas).
---
I dunno, especs don’t seem too outrageous. Mike Z did say they’re going to have expansion level features in season 5, at a time when living world mounts were already in the pipe. Elite specs are the only thing that’s missing.
---
&gt;My guess is the "going to be a mix of season 1 and season 4/5" is true, it's just too oddly specific of a guess imo.
---
It's not that odd or specific tbh. It was rather hinted at in the "What's Next" post where it was stated that Season 5 won't be doing a "one map per release" like Seasons 3 and 4, but will occasionally focus on expanding pre-existing maps. Since then, folks have thought they meant in the same manner as Season 1 but permanent (e.g., how Southsun Cove got expanded during Last Stand at Southsun, or Kessex Hills).
---
Personally though I think that was more referring to a Season 2 style of map releases, where a map has more to explore as releases go out, and can be accessed via multiple episodes instead of one (something that really hindered S4 with Sun's Refuge and Thunderhead Keep being places to return to, but couldn't go to the actual map).
---
I was at Best Buy I think and looking at computer games, I thought that girl on the cover of the GW Prophecies cover looked pretty cool so I bought it. I didn't really get into the game though till I bought Factions. Been playing ever since.
---
What are you even on? Elite specs revitalize old content. Even after running wing 1 a hundred times, I get to enjoy it in a new light when a new type of build becomes available. Elite specs are the number one most important thing to keep veteran players around.
---
HoT was basically a bulk of LW content and a feature patch. LW seasons do get occasional feature patches too, so the comparison made by Blademaster still rather stands.
---
If you compare what PoF added to what Season 3 or Season 4 added, they're pretty much on par in every field.
---
As much as I have issues with GW2 right now, it *is* still better even it's going at a snail's pace.
---
I'd rather not reset that.
---
Also GW2 still ran like ass back in the day.
---
&gt;HoT was basically a bulk of LW content and a feature patch. LW seasons do get occasional feature patches too, so the comparison made by Blademaster still rather stands.
---
This is ridiculous. They added whole new systems, pvp modes, wvwvw maps, and tons of content. HOT was a huge content dump all at once.
---
\&gt; If you compare what PoF added to what Season 3 or Season 4 added, they're pretty much on par in every field.  
---
Except for something like 6 new maps at once, a whole new bounty system, mounts, and elite specs for every character. There is so much more content in expansions that you're shrugging off.
---
You've clearly never even watched a video of GW1.
---
Most of the current roster is actually in a pretty good place right now by my assessment, and a lot of the current issues could be better solved by adding new Elite Specs to fill gaps rather than trying to balance the existing ones to fit multiple roles - Ranger could use a proper Power Spec, for example, allowing Soulbeast to focus more on Condi (or vice versa if they want to swing that way), and Scourge would benefit from not having to be stretched between Condi and Support quite so much. Not all of them are optimal or practical in every mode, but that's kind of unavoidable and there isn't anything that's totally unplayable either. The only things that I'd say really need a total overhaul are Scrapper and Chronomancer, but that is indeed a kettle of fish I'd rather not deal with at the moment, particularly Chrono.
---
So sylvari is 4 Spritwood and 1 elonian leather and asura is flat 15gold. Oh the hidden costs.
---
Also consider this when choosing:
---
Asura gives a recipe that may be needed for food.
---
Sylvari rewards a free garden plot for ascended herbs.
---
Without charr one will never drop the new meat that is required in alot of recipes.
---
Norn and human might be visuals in home instance only, correct me if wrong
---
No one can honestly answer that without knowing why you quit.
---
In that case then yeah you might as well, there's been a bunch of new maps.
---
This is how my husband and I made all of our friends.  Joining in on the convo in their comms helps too.  We're still friends with 7 of them six years later.  We've even met a couple of them in real life.  Good times.
---
You do the collection for cooking (unlocked at 425) and you get "portable composter" recipe. It's 4 spiritwood planks and elonian leather.
---
There is guide somewhere in this sub I suggest looking into
---
My point was more that ANet could add every feature that has ever been asked for and then some, and promise enough future LW and Expansion content to cover a decade or more, and there would still be some cretin complaining about how it was *clearly* a sign that ANet was done with the game and was going to put it on life support to work on a new project or some other nonsense. Some people just aren't happy unless they're complaining about something, and the internet has an unfortunate habit of enabling them. I guarantee you, no matter what ANet announces, be it amazing or terrible, there will be a post here on Reddit within 24 hours bemoaning everything wrong with what they're doing and how they're abandoning the game - that's just how these things tend to go.
---
Clearly it says “Are you ready to catch the very first look at an all-new chapter in Guild Wars 2‘s Living World story?” From the announcement. 
---
In the video they very clearly make it sound like expansions are done.
---
Your not an American thats for sure.
---
Just to add, it's the general launch of things he gets info with, not every episode release
---
thx a lot for such a good explanation;3
---
This sounds a lot like the "ticking" theme in Interstellar when they're on the high-gravity planet.
---
There's the odd watch partnership, and there's this. I wonder if season 5 is going to involve time in some way?
---
Fucking yes ban people like the assholes I copied from chat. Assholes finding excuses for being assholes and blaming their behaviour on others, no way! Water wet, more at eleven. Anet is not their therapist, they don't have to engage these failures.
---
At least *fake* being a decent human being while outside of your discord bubble with the other crazies that think that being 'ignoried' by a online computer game company gives them the right to act like a disgusting pile of dogshit.
---
announcement : mobile gw2
---
Absolutely agree with that perspective on elite specs. They are incredibly important for also revitalising older content through a different way to play that content. Elite specs also provide extra things to work towards, such as gear for new builds.
---
Elite specs are one of the things I really feel *must* be addressed on Friday.
---
Simple fix, selete your character and make a new one ;)
---
lol what did they say?
---
There are no dots to connect, Greg Miller is a popular game journalist host, he also hosted E3 this year.
---
I learned something new today, I honestly thought that digital stuff like game accounts weren't protected by law and only by the developers of the game.
---
You can get plenty of clovers from mount maelstrom ... partly because the drop seems buggy.

You clearly just assume things about people, don't you?

I had a Feathers of Dwayna drop once and salvaged it without noticing, I just randomly noticed I had the skin one day.

My out-there prediction/hope: New elite specs revealed, specifically new music-themed mesmer spec called Siren. New weapon will be... Warhorn makes the most/only sense, I guess?
---
apparently, even though the emotes are just basically facial expressions.. anet goes by 1-2 articles of what is spoken of pepe of being either racist or a hate symbol.  Which imo is none of those, but good luck getting them to change their mind.

not much compared to highly addicted no-lifers, sure. why is it a competition in this sub to see who spends more time on an online game?
---
I don't really agree. I mostly play, it because I love the story, the maps and the new masteries they add, etc. I've got a nice build on my main character which deals a fine amount of damage and keeps me alive and is fun to play. As long as they don't nerf it in PvE I won't have any problems and'll still enjoy the game. I don't buy the Expansions for the elite specs, I buy it for the listed reasons above

Started playing the GW1 beta with friends and co-workers. (Love ya, Oink!)

Yay, this means I can get the package in Belgium too? :-D
---
Your post is wrong on multiple levels and I hate myself for being baited into discussion with you.
---
I am not on a hype train for classic wow or other games. I dont know how you managed this mental gymnastics. I am talking about gw games only.
---
In addition, in your post above you demonstrate that you dont understand what classic gw2 would mean. You use story argument to say that gw and gw2 are the same game. I dont know even where to start with that idiotic statement. Nothing beyond story is the same for these games. Combat is different, builds are different, equipment is different, looting is different, teamplay is different, content structure is different, game modes are different, even the genre isnt the same for gw and gw2.
---
As I said above, your argumentation is in line with suggesting people who wanted WoW classic to go play W3.
---
I don't think this is true. I just loaded up GW, went into pre-searing Regent Valley, found a big group of Grawl and they killed me :( I never even attacked them.

I think that all points to Grawl being a relatively minor nuisance rather than everyone getting along.
---
Thats not correct. At least not for veterans. Who cares if you get new specs if you still do the same content? You'll be able to escape chronojail and provide boons on the exact same encounters, only with a different build? Meh.
---
Casual community wouldn't be even aware those are useful runes.
---
I was trying out all kinds of mmos at 14,15 vame across gw 1 but it really did't click with me. Then in 2010 or then the first news of gw2 came out i gave it another chance and i was hooked by almost everything i saw. To this day it's the only game i pre ordered just to play early and it was worth it.
---
Although I agree with most of you guys about expansion having a ton of kick and hype surrounding them, Guild Wars 2 has proven that expansions do not necessarily mean an abundance of good quality content. I mean, HoT was saved my Raids and later patches, PoF was just underwhelming for me in terms of content. The latter was just 4-5 living World updates bundled together.   
---
That means, at least imo, there isn't too much of a problem if there's no expansion on the horizon IF the studio shows (tomorrow hopefully) that they can ship expansion-level content every 2-3 months. I do not think they will ship a season pass for real money but I would be okay with a gem store Season Pass. For me the New Horizon Pack is not interesting as I don't want half of the pack's content but something similar would be okay with every patch. Let's say they release a pack for 2400 gem every patch that includes Mount skins, Outfits, Weapon Skins, plus something that ties into whatever the new thing they are aiming for be it housing, fishing or even build templates. That would mean that a good chunk of the playerbase would buy gems every now and then in my opinion.
---
So I think the key is to have content every 3 months (AT MAX!) that has meaningful repeatable content and support it with a Raid/Fractal/VP/WvW release every time.
---
This is why you never allow anyone to know your password, no matter who it is.
---
Jessica Price, *sigh*. She just needs help or move to the Moon, instead.
---
All we have is op's word, we don't know for sure if she actually broke into his house. She might have had a key or someone let her in after being kicked out. People tend to exaggerate. Unless she has serious mental issues, it's unlikely that she went to all this length of deleting characters and possibly breaking in simply because she was mad that he didn't go to a club with her and wanted to play games. This kind of situation normally is a result of relationship issues and emotions that have been welling up for a while. The op seems to enjoy playing games, perhaps that is all he does and expects their relationship to magically work, with no effort on his part. Maybe she was so desperate for attention from the person she cared for and had had enough. No one likes to be ignored especially when they are mad and yelling. Even if they both were avid gamers who did nothing but play online games, they would still need to take some time away from games and spend quality time together, otherwise the relationship would just go stale.  Sounds like a narcissistic relationship to me. Maybe he is exaggerating, maybe not. Either way, it's clear both have issues, as does everyone, both are better of without each other and need to work on their own issues.
---
well the last one I get cuz anet banning people using pepe emotes, but the dead game thing's been going around for a while.. the "game is trash" sounds more like WoW players being dicks..
---
We will see. I'd be inclined to agree with you if it weren't for the fact that OSRS has an absolutely enormous active community. Larger than GW2's community by certain metrics.
---
They've already said that. A ranger/monk is essentially a druid. A warrior/assassin is like a spellbreaker. GW2 explicitly avoids dual professions because most combinations with dual professions suck, and they were a balance nightmare. Explicitly designing elite specs to branch out into the themes of other professions or roles (warriors becoming more support, rangers becoming more support, elementalists becoming more tank etc) is the way we do it now.
---
They could, but this is much less exciting than getting another, new weapon. Not to mention it ends up giving less choice and diversity.
---
And don't take this the wrong way, but you don't seem to understand how the weapon skills system works, on a technical level.
---
did... did you just suggest ranger for WvW?
---
The two big things that killed RS was the removal of the wilderness and EoC. They essentially reverted 07 RS, imagine if we got GW2 classic, what would we get, a buggy game with less content.
---
&gt; What is an expansion but a bulk of living world content though?
---
It's so sad that expansions are just living world with extra features. GW2 expansions are truly pathetic.
---
tfw you realise you have an entire bank tab filled with once useless trash food
---
In 2005 or 2006 our family bought a new computer and for the first time I got to pick a game from the store to play. I immediately went with GW1 because, well basically because of the boxart.
---
Had a blast pre-searing with everything being so colourful and joyful but was immediately turned off once I hit post-searing Ascalon because it all felt so dark and gloomy. Took me about a week or two to get my shit together and actually play the game from start to finish.
---
 I actually still sort of hate Ascalon as a whole because of this and don't bear a similar grudge to any other area. Though Kaineng City, or whatever it was called, is a close second. Jeez, I hated that place.
---
I was really hyped for GW2 but as I was in college with a crap pc at the time of release, I only got to play  it a year after or something. Until this day it remains my favourite on-and-off game to play.
---
Common tell us plebs how ranger is not ok in wvw?
---
My point is that we shouldn't waste valuable resources and game dev time on making a scraped version of the game we play today, just to jump on a classic hype train, and there are still many things that needs to be fixed in GW2. If you want a scraped version of GW2, go play its predecessor.
---
I dont want gw2 classic. Im correcting your wrong statements.
---
Gratz mate. Living world is pretty easy to understand.  
---
If you're around when the episodes are live, you unlock them free. If not they have to be purchased from the gem store.
---
After the personal story, came Living World Season 1 but you can't play it anymore.

That's followed by Living World Season 2, Heart of Thorns Expansion, Living World Season 3, Path of Fire expansion, Living World Season 4, if you want to play the story in order.
---
Keep in mind expansion content is harder than core content. I help a lot of casual players learn the game. If you want some help with what to do next or stories when you get them, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563...assuming you're on a US server anyway.
---
If you don't sacrifice your enjoyment for the sake of efficiency, you're doing it wrong. So yes, you really, really suck at MMOs. That's a good thing.
---
Congrats to your milestone and see you in another year once you got your raptor! :D
---
Because of the gem store, limited item effects, and wardrobe combined, any item that isn't absolutely insanely rare to drop will be pretty cheap. The gemstore makes sure everyone has access to the same buyers and sellers, so availability is constant. Wardrobe makes sure you don't actually need the same item more than once, and the limited item effects means you don't need it for much more than the skin, so any subsequent findings will go directly to the gemstore and drive the prices down.
---
So yeah, it seems insane to not have a precursor drop in thousands of hours, but over the entire game there are enough people to get one for the gemstore all the time still. If it was any less rare, it would also be worth less gold.
---
OSRS tho

for zerging it's the meme class on the same level as necro was for raid content. And you suggest roaming while roaming is almost dead, because of the mount. But, I guess you can play solo roamer ranger and get that 2 minutes of fun battle in 3 hours of getting kited or ganked.
---
Well... yes. But there's also more of it, it's more thematically consistent, there are more earnable rewards like armors or weapon skins and it's generally of higher quality and polish.
---
Most LS episodes have been really underwhelming so far, you play there for a week or two and then never come back unless it's to grind one particular thing. Meanwhile HoT had tons of content you could come back to and slowly work on over the years, and it didn't really feel like grind, at least not to me idk. It had its fair share of problems, mostly depending on zergs and generally other people, but it's in a pretty good place now, especially considering it was the first gw2 expansion.
---
I have really set us up to have the expectation that this is only a living story release. I am Magine that if they have not produced another expansion, they likely have poured that same development time into something a little more than the usual. Hopefully they come up with something unexpected.
---
Well the game pointed me to a mission speaking to someone named Ella i think and it sent me a letter stating i can no longer play season 1 but they can give me a run down. Is the run down they provide not very good?
---
Ladies and gents we got "roaming is dead - ranger is shit - necro is a meme" kind of player here. Get off your metabattle crack buddy
---
That's a 2 minute recap for a year and a half of game. Most people find it completely insufficient. You should obviously do that, but it's not enough.
---
I'm surprised that she was smart enough to log into your account and delete the characters, with such a child-like behaviour. Anyways, I'm sure Anet can give you the charactera back.
---
Cool thanks! Im not super into the games lore like i was when i first started playing but ill look into it
---
I know right? What a nymphomanic psychopomp.
---
Been playing on/off since beta but the only half decent drop I got was an ascended shield from a fractal chest. Sometimes feels like it's not even worth trying
---
No no NO! They will annoounce gw3 on mobile and dedicate full attention to gw3 leaving only the gemstore updates for gw2. They will also announce they don't like competitive gameplay and delete pvp/wvw/raids from gw2 because they make the game lag. Third announcement is season 5 itself which is actually just a 20 minute cinematic that fills in the gap between gw2 and gw3 kinda like what season 1 is these days.
---
Any chance it was the golden fractal bow?
---
I quit playing STWOR because it was pretty boring (I'm a fan of Star Wars, the game has awesome story, but gameplay wasn't what I expected). In 2016 I was looking for a new game and I remember watching a short movie about best MMO games. Guild Wars 2 was one of them. Other movie said it is worth playing, so I gave it a try.
---
I haven't played any other game since I met Guild Wars 2. Best. MMORPG. Ever. I love action combat, I love the story, I love the world design, I love not-grinding-and-not-depending-on-luck (like asian games are - you're lucky or you have to grind... otherwise you are nothing).
---
Well if that's how they wanted to end GW2, it would have been a very unsatisfying end. If anything should end GW2, it should be the end of the world, consumed by the mists - done right, this would burn into memory.
---
This is not about what is the game u playing. It can be U just eating your chips and she still yells at you  about eat your chips or go out with her. And she come back to destroy all your chips
---
That's Twitch chat for ya. The vast majority of it can fuck right off.
---
where is the proof that it's teapot's community?  
---
Couldn't it just be some random asshats in the official gw2 stream chat?
---
rOaMiNg Is DeD, RanGoOr Is ShAiT aNd NeCro Is A mEmE cLaAaAaAasS
---
Ps: Which "ladies" you mean?
---
Wait until you learn about Lucidity and the entire NA WvW community.
---
Gw1 remake
---
iirc they have many possible end point for the story and that's something planned years in advance
---
Since the victorious kit contained in the 7th anniversary gift let you select the specific dye within a set I'm assuming it's gonna be the same here.
---
Apparently yes. People just need something that they have to buy andthat is called expansion apparently. Me, I'd be happy if it's just LS stuff as long as they improve on the formula. If they throw in elite specs and other new expansion worthy stuff along the way... is it really that different from an expansion? People are saying LS is just "play for a few hours and you're done" but expansion is pretty much the same thing, only you get it in bulk. So you play intensively for longer, let's say days but then you are in the same place as you were before.
---
So I would need 18 Grandmaster Leatherworker's Mark's which can be obtained from 180 Grandmaster Mark Shard's
---
Or converting whatever Grandmaster Mark Shard I may have into  Grandmaster Leatherworker's Mark's, and crafting the remaining  Grandmaster Leatherworker's Mark's from the recipe using 
---
Carbonized Mithrillium Ingot
---
Square of Vabbian Silk
---
Blended Leather Sheet
---
Empowered Cured Thick Leather Square
---
&gt; Imagine if you could convince Anet that "good morning" was code for white nationalists establishing the new world order, and they'd start banning people for a simple greeting. That's basically what happened here just on a larger scale.
---
The important thing to note here, though, is that in this hypothetical example the *actual* white nationalists would co-opt the "good morning" as an actual dogwhistle and use it unironically.
---
Rarely did I get what I wanted when I specifically played content for RNG stuff. That's a lesson I learned: if you really want something and can buy it instead of using RNG: buy it. Stuff for me usually just dropped whenever I was last expecting it. No precursor so far, but since I played fractals quite a bit I've git quite a bit of ascended weapons and armor boxes from there.
---
The two drops I remember most was an HoT-hammer that I sold for ~50g, at a time where that was an unbelievably large amount of money for me. It's all perspective...
---
The second was a TT-Wurm's armor chest for joining a kill just because I was a little bored. Not that I need or like the skin, but it's rare, so it's nice, you know? :)
---
is level 53 still the ideal level to open champion loot bags (to get the most money)???
---
Not in instanced pve, no.
---
Open world pve anything is good and range might make you safer if you don't know how to combat some bosses or ads. 
---
In wvw you can play scourge, herald or staff ele in zergs, or yet again anything you want while roaming. 
---
I'm unsure about spvp build tier lists but I'm sure there are plenty of builds that at least have a ranged weapon on weapon swap.
---
This is not to defend "his" "community" but this is far from being a Teapot related/exclusive issue, or even a Twitch/Discord related issue.
---
It is extremely rare to not find this kind of stuff on a lot of semi-public and/or popular Discords, Twitch streams and unfortunately literally everywhere else from people not LGBT.
---
While this should be addressed (and probably won't) you could also say that about a good chunk of the rather popular current and former regular GW2 streamers and related big community Discords.
---
This is not to provide an excuse but to say that this is a wider issue that should be (or should have been) addressed on a bigger scale way before considering all the shit that is being said on such platforms.
---
Name... Checks out?
---
The wall rangers give rangers a bad reputation. Also the pinsnipers and the floor rangers in zerg play. Otherwise they're just another roam class.
---
Clearly those people are idiots. But pretending that you won't find that kind of comment in LA map just to reinforce your negative opinion of someone is ridiculous.
---
If it were actually teapot saying this then you would have a point. It's not though, so you don't.
---
maybe they live stream someone playing the first half of the episode and end with "but the other half you have to play on yourself".
---
I was doing research for illusionist spells for a 1st edition AD&amp;D blog, and this Mesmer class and it’s skills kept popping up on my internet searches. I figured I’d give it a go, and I’ve been hooked since 2015.
---
Again: Welcome to the year xyz in the past :D
---
Assuming that gaming might mean that you're not a regular functioning person is a very old concept.
---
A friend recommended Guild Wars Prophecies to me back in the day and we played it every night together. It was such a blast advancing together, collecting Elite Skills, enjoying the story quests etc. etc. Hopped on the train of Guild Wars 2 on launch day and am playing it on and off to this day.
---
My older cousin told me about it in 2012 and we still play together sometimes even though he’s like a working adult now :/
---
Jormag makes the temperature on Tyria drop rapidly so we need to move to another planet. ~~Burning Crusade~~ New Horizons ~~expansion~~ LW5 confirmed! 
---
To be honest, with asura tech I'd say space travel is pretty possible in GW2 universe.
---
You can add me, I'm on the EU server too: WhiteMouse.9843
---
And then they complain for lack of content :O
---
For Peppercorn decent place is Bitterfrost Frontier - there is quite a few permanent nodes there, if you learn their position the farm route is pretty good. Alternative would be Timberline Falls, going from NW waypoint south, but it's random.
---
Mint seeds seems to drop in Kryta and Ascalon - there is no really good maps to farm that, Lake Doric with new Verdant Herbs nodes is probably best, if you have combat ready alts, are willing to gather wood and still need Jade.
---
Cloves are the easiest to obtain in Mount Maelstrom, in the west of the Crucible of Eternity. Jungle Plants in Heart of the Maguuma have very low dropchance, but you can try farming them in Bloodstone Fen.
---
Cilantro/Sesame is easily farmed in farm spots in Sandswept Isles and Domain of Kourna.
---
[removed]
---
I was not interested in GW2 because i didn't like GW1.
---
But i gave it a try on Beta Weekend and got hooked on WvW immediately. After weekend me i my brother preordered game.
---
Not just pepe emotes, any frog related emote will get you banned.
---
I think the general population - your average player in game, not on Reddit - definitely doesn't care _as much_ for elite specs, but more for the new maps, new mechanisms (mounts/gliders), masteries, achievements, etc.
---
A Little backstory first. 
---
  
---
Back in the days where dungeon running was a thing and there was a host or a party leader who had the power to kick people at will there was a toxic behaviour of selling dungeons by kicking the party members right before or during the final boss. 
---
It was so common of a problem that me and my guildmates decided to take a break and quit the game for some time. But before that i decided to make some noise on the official forum.
---
I know i broke the rules and all, but i posted a list of every person from my blocked list that was tied to party kicking. To my suprise, i wasnt alone as in a matter of 1 hour topic was 10pages long with people posting their own lists.  
---
Naturally the thread was deleted and i was contacted with a mod saying that i violated the rules etc. I know forum mod is not a dev but i replied by saying that this is my feedback to how broken the game is atm and they should fix it or more threads like mine will follow.  
---
Next day me and my guild decided to do one last dungeon run for goodbye. We started with AC, took p1 and when we finished destroying barrows after the boss at foefire wp... I got Dusk. Back then it was worth around 900-1000g. 
---
Coincidence? To this day i have a hard time believing that.  
---
I took 6 months break anyway. I play since launch and that was my only precursor drop in over 8000 hours played.
---
Or, you know, don't date crazy chicks...
---
even twitch sub emotes?
---
Yeah, that was a bullshit circlejerk theory that only r/Guildwars2 believed. A major mobile developer like NCSoft coming into ArenaNet to save them from "mobiles"? NCSoft West *is* ArenaNet management, and after the layoffs ArenaNet now has even less creative independence.
---
I agree. Wasn’t the teaser logo for this announcement literally ice vs fire?
---
In a perfect world, this LW will be 5 episodes, conclude the Jormag/Primordus act once and for all, with an expansion releasing in Fall 2020 to finish up GW2
---
Thanks, those were the right pages, I always ended up missing some materials, then forget why.  
---
I already updated my material list.
---
Y, if it's emote of a some kind of frog, you get ban hammered.
---
Playing this game for loot feels like working on a minimum wage. All content is always accessible and quite casual for the most part, so the rewards are shitty. I rarely ever get excited about loot in GW2, it's just not that kind of game.
---
Disagree. That's opinion. I'd much rather get a weapon with actual skin variety than a basically identical weapon doing the same thing with half the skins.
---
And you clearly have access to the code so you obviously understand it perfectly. I mean, ANet themselves have said multiple times that the weapon and armor code is a mess, but I'm sure you know better.
---
tbh, either you didnt play a lot or you should check your items more often before trashing them.
---
About 3 months after I started I got the endless anomaly tonic. Unfortunately I didn't know the value and added it to my wardrobe.
---
It wasn't how they wanted to end it. It was more of a 'if this game gets cancelled at this point, at least we'll have this as a decent ending'.
---
and talking about elite specs, until they work how to properly balance in pvp and wvw. and stem the insane power creep I new specs would actually make things worse
---
Can you elaborate?
---
got my 5th precursor yesterday, which was the bard (but was my 2nd bard in total ) dropped it from the moltenboss fractals trashmobs on the preboss.
---
it is crazy to see how many people in this thread droppped a chak infusion already, like wtf
---
GW2 on low levels is both a very fast-paced and a very casual game, meaning players aren't usually in the mindset to cooperate for anything. You have to be lucky and find someone who actually wants the social interaction for its own sake, and I feel like many players find that too exhausting or risky. 
---
The solution is definitely to find an active guild and go get to "endgame", where the dedicated, social players are.
---
This video was 21min and look what WP all talked about. No fucking way they are just going to talk about S5.. its just not going to happen. There will 100% be more. So i think you are being a bit rediculous. :)
---
I love the sound. Beautiful and haunting.
---
We started playing Prophecies on the recommendation of a friend after SWG shot itself in the foot...fourteen years ago this month.  He said it was beautiful and that was definitely the case although the crafting was disappointing.  SWG crafting was light years beyond any other game I've played and it was my first MMO, so I got spoiled.
---
Here is a link for the mentioned video. https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg
---
It is pointless to build full fledged map and then just rebuild it. That is months of lost dev time. 
---
And it is pointless to release half-empty maps. So I guess that would not be viable way to go.
---
I saw an ad for Neverwinter with a cool dragon on it. Then I remembered reading something about it being pay to win so I tried GW instead because it also had dragons.
---
Ohhh right, that's exactly what happened, you're right! Thanks a lot!
---
I feel bad for having sent a ticket to support now
---
the patchnotes means consuming them. so getting xp. And btw, u still can just buy 1 unid gear at a time
---
Went from my old computer with an i5 2500K, GTX 770 and 12GB DDR3 to an i7 9700K, RTX 2080 and 16GB DDR4 and I was pretty disappointed with the performance. Had to turn some stuff down to stop the game from randomly freezing a lot. I'd love for them to fix the performance.
---
I still use these foods. Nice try.
---
I think a lot of the game's art could use some tweaking towards higher quality.
---
Got 3 precursors from the Mystic forge
---
2 Infusion from Wintersday presents
---
Playing since the start
---
It will be the new LS, a bunch of cash shop stuff and maybe a few lower quality items you can get for actually playing the game.
---
Orrrrr the tassel is creative freedom?
---
My new boyfriend played Guild Wars, it seemed to be one of his main hobbies. I was up late one night, and decided to look at what it was on their site. I saw there was a free trial, so downloaded it and made a necromancer. I told him the next day, I had spent all night on it and that it was so cool. He got really excited that I was interested in his favorite game and made a necro to play and guide me through the campaign. We bonded so much over it. Eventually, he told me about how they teased Guild Wars 2, but it had been a while ago. Shortly after, trailers started appearing for Guild Wars 2, and I was mesmerized by it. We had ended up with the same job in the same place, and I worked so hard saving really fast to build my first PC so I could play Guild Wars 2. I was so nervous that I wouldn't make enough money in time, but I did! Choosing and buying the parts, storing them in a larger box bit by bit, was one of the most exciting times for me. From beta til now, I have played an incredible amount. Over 8 years, I and my boyfriend are still together, living with my 9-year-old cat that is now our cat.
---
I would love to be able to use the Spear as a land weapon on my ranger or even my warrior but what I want most of all is the scythe from GW1. I've long since given up on them making Dervish a new class. I've wanted it since the beginning along with the Tengu as a playable race but nope that wont happen. I'll have to settle with a scythe elite spec.
---
I think that most people will be satisfied with one elite spec set per season.
---
There is still a lot of different things that can get implemented that would be of similar impact. 
---
The thing is that we do get such updates outside of LS5 already - they could have waited with cooking 500 for LS5 and advertise it as another big thing within it, yet they didn't. Legendary runes. Rune salvaging. Tonic wardrobe. And many similar huge reworks make it into the game, but as they are not tied to any expansion or LS, many people just don't give them enough weight. Anet could use it as big advertisement leverage if they bundled it within LS releases and yet they never do it (and then people complain that LS does not offer enough stuff, completely being blind to all releases in between).
---
Maybe check OP's name
---
I've heard rumor of GW2 on cell phones so now I'm scared.
---
It never was
---
That makes me think of Unreal Tournament...
---
It wasn't before.
---
&gt; most people will be satisfied with one elite spec per season
---
That really depends on the release cadence. If it’s once per 3 months, then there’s no way that’ll fly, especially if your main is last to receive one.
---
First a man can falsely accuse as well as a woman. Second i'd be a speciest since were talking about a whole different animal. Third yoy're the rascist since you assumed that chimps is slang for blacks. Fourth this thing smells like "i'm too shitty at my job so i'll make controvertial shit up to gain some publicity" feminazi shit. Fifth you're a twat.
---
A friend of mine from Runescape told me about it in 2016. Stuff happened and I stopped playing after about a week, but i’d still bought Heart of Thorns. Finally, last year (actually, just over a year ago), I basically got bored with Runescape and decided to give this game a try.I basically haven’t looked back at all.
---
Atleast it's different to revive the modea for half a year :)
---
I got the best solution! Lets not introduce any elite specs are all! That would satisfy everyone.
---
I think adding 1-3 elite specs every update would work just fine.  This isn't HoT, where not having a viable elite spec would be a great disadvantage, now  every class is covered with viable options in most game modes. (That, hovewer, leads to a typical "horizontal profgression" fatigue. Lets say they introduce a condi-oriented engineer spec. And it is still worse than mirage/rene/weaver and fb in their fields of expertise. That would be a leftdown). People who would be strongly upset about "their" class not getting and update right now are either casual enough to handle the wait or should seriously consider multiclassing. Slower pace of elite spec releases would also allow balance team to fix and integrate stuff better and marketing team to maintain at least some kind of hype. 
---
But I don't expect any elite specs to be released at all. Even if a-net started rushing them right after layoff, they are still far from ready.
---
I've met two really great guilds through here. Find one you like the look of and message the contact.
---
makes little sense, what is a point of a spec if it's incomplete? using that is just crippling yourself.
---
color of HPs has so far been irrelevant. core ones are yellow, non-core ones green, they still go to the exact same pool.
---
It seems I may have got it from an old pvp reward :)
---
still I would like the old hearts back with all the pickups and fun weapons/stuff
---
Really hoping for an icy-blue character screen, kinda tired of the PoF one :)
---
My first girlfriend showed me the tequatl world boss event, made a gamemap for me and bought me the game, we made a full map completion and played the story together. Times I look back on fondly. Unfortunatly she made a mistake by buying gems on a bank account that was not covered and she got a permanent suspension. She quit the game and i am still playing today
---
It would likely be cheaper, living world is only free for a period of time. It would also spread out the required work. I’m not sayings it’s a good idea, just something I could see happening if ANet decide no more expansions.
---
IMO even worse than introducing the elite specs in sets. That just gives us 9 elites that feel shit to play until multiple episodes have released.
---
Blue hero points just means we're going into a new region. You can still use HoT hero points for PoF specs and PoF for HoT specs. Also, do you have a link to that particular datamine? That'd be a huge point in favour towards elite specs if it's true.
---
Doing Rhendak quite often, and got the 200g signet. Also got 80g drop from Arah gates invasion. One just has to participate in such events to get such loots, doing silverwastes farm or similar brainless gameplay of course does not drop those.
---
What would be of similar impact to a set of elites? Honest question. Elites are entirely new ways to play, usable everywhere in the entire game. Nothing comes close to their impact IMO.
---
How would you use it if you have to wait months to completely unlock the full spec?
---
Even in braindead open world it would feel really awkward and weak to not have every trait available to you.
---
That's why that one guy bought all cheeseburger off of the TP!
---
yeah, I agree. when we get new elite specs, its periodical (but I would say 3/3/3. one light/middle/heavy with every release) or all at once. another idea would be to get all with the first episode but unlock them with every release more and more. but I dont know if that would be a good idea.
---
&gt; Imagine if they introduce 9 elite specs for the first episode, and then a mount for the second. And a new fractal/raid for the third... It would feel like such a "letdown" after a big thing in the first episode. People are going to complain "We got NINE ELITE SPECS in the first ep, now they're going with just a mount for the second. I'm disappointed!".
---
I dont think that would happen. ofc a few would say that, but I believe the vast majority would be okay with that.
---
I think people are trolling BECAUSE Anet is so sensitive to any form of dark humor
---
Do this achievement:  
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gourmet\_Training](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gourmet_Training)
---
No sadly not, it would need a compatibly patch and the autor of gw2hook does not work on it anymore
---
This is too much...
---
It looks like there's an ice creature standing below the countdown.
---
Maybe it showed up as giftable while it was locked for you, not impossible. Sadly it's not :( But I guess a TP to friend on alt accs is nice to have
---
Ah bummer. Hook gives my game around 40 FPS but it’ll drop often. Probably not worth it.
---
That's the downside of a convenient server wide trading post. All things that drop - sometimes - even if it's rather rare, lose their value because there are just so many players in your market
---
Good reason for them to finally add underwater only elite specs with a separate build panel for when underwater, as part of an underwater combat revamp.
---
All 9 at the same time. I don't want to see my favorite being 18 months away while others can enjoy theirs right from the start.
---
Except the Charr have always been barbaric warmongers to the point that it's literally ingrained in their culture. To the point where even Asura in GW1 mention things that imply that the Asura view the Charr as little more than feral animals.
---
&gt;never forget that defeat, train and bide our time
---
Or in other words: &gt;Start worshipping minions of the human god that gave them magic in the first place.
---
I think the general way that the Charr behave in GW1 sets them aside as the villains pretty clearly, but of course most people in GW2 aren't aware of that because they haven't actually played GW1. :0
---
Im pretty sure you only need Cooking level 425
---
You think that Anet care? Everything not on gemstore is not priority and should be passion project of random developer (off-time, not paid).
---
Considering that ingame mail is rather important system for the game to function and was never touched from 2012 I guess it is in huge technical debt and would need whole team to effectively resurrect it and improve.
---
I strongly disagree. 
---
Trying to force current and future spec skills to work underwater has caused all kinds of issues, revenant was especially bad during it’s release. 
---
An elite spec for each class with skills and traits specifically designed to work underwater and made available not as an expansion elite spec is the best approach to underwater combat.
---
For the upgraded oven?
---
Reshade does work with dx912pxy, so you could use that.
---
Has a lot of nice effects as well, some tank the fps quite a bit though
---
My biggest drop in nearly 3k hours were  3 Brilliant Djinn Doubloon from W7, sold them for 150G. I was also "lucky" to drop a Ghostly Infusion, after my 20th Gorseval or something.
---
Really? I always keep a few stacks of cookies on me to hand out to people who are nice and help me out. Or to welcome newbies.
---
I think they are aiming for faster releases again. when not every release has a map now, I think we can speculate with a 8 weeks release cadance again.
---
Don't say that on the GW2 sub-reddit or the race hipsters will get angery. 👀
---
It all started with a theft. Guild Wars 1 was my third big game love after Age of Empires and Runescape. And I have to admit that I couldn't afford Guild Wars Prophecies when I was 12 years old. That's why I stole it from a store. I regret some things in life, but definitely not this! Otherwise I would have missed thousands of wonderful hours together with my brother in Tyria!
---
I was really looking forward to GW2 and bought it as soon as it came out. But I never got all warm with it. I give GW2 a new chance every few years and have played a few hundred hours to date, but it has never become my great love.
---
And now that Blizzard has made its fans overjoyed with WOW Classic and created a huge hype, I long more than ever for Guild Wars 1. I wouldn't need a HD remake or new content.  I want a new server where we can all start from scratch. A server on which the economy can develop anew and on which new guilds and builds can be created again. A server where not all players are already gods among mortals, but can become gods again.
---
Downloaded the game again after a few years, what to do and where to go? No expansions, thinking of buying them. No pvp matches or WvW stuff happening(could be the time Im online).

i heard about gw1 in about 2010, but never got around to playing it much beyond the ascalon -pre-searing beginning, i loved it immediately and announcement of gw2 just began then so i slowly began to love this world of tyria, but unfortunetely i did not play properly guildwars1 at that time, then my life had lots of personal issues that didn't get resolved until around 2013, but i was folling gw2 closely and played as soon as i could on december 2012 :) and played ever since :) my regret it that i only fully dived into guildwars1 and the 3 expansions and tried my best at that until just early 2018, so i completed alot of gw2 content already now trying to go as far as i can in gw1 :)

I've been playing Lineage 2 for more than half my life. One day, I somehow clicked on the NCSoft logo and got to a site mentioning other games from NCSoft. One of which was Guild Wars. I got to try other games from NCSoft simply because I **loved** (and still do) Lineage 2 (the old one, not the current one). Without that little misclick I would probably never got to play Tabula Rasa, City of Heroes, Guild Wars or Aion, or at least not since their start. So many fond memories. Guild Wars 2 was then, you see, a logical try. And a try it was, logged on day one and I've been in love with it ever since. I am also very happy with the payment model both GWs have. My parents, obviously, had been paying for official servers during the time I wasn't yet making money, so without them I would never have gotten the chance either and I think that needs to be mentioned as well.

Contact support, they can restore your characters. Also, contact the police Bout the break in and destruction of your property.

just look at how much they censor their forums

CAN I TA-
---
nope, the only pattern i’ve noticed so far is that it crashes when the time is an hour and five minutes; like 12:05, 1:05, 2:05. it’s a really odd pattern and i’ve tried using a separate gw2 launcher- still didn’t work, i’m not sure what to do at this point besides just living with the crashes.
---
I cant remember really, I just knew it. Like I was in the gaming, rpg and shit and eventually you will heard or read something somewhere. It's one of the biggest MMO brand after all.
---
yes

Maybe he used the deadeye elite skill

For organized  PvE people stack for buffs but your fine for everything else. Check out deadeye elite spec, thief class.

My father brought me a PC Gamer magasine (the one and only "PC Gamer" I own to this day) from the airport when he returned from some work trip and in it was an article about gw2 and an A2 poster featuring the charr warrior concept art. 
---
I read that article more times than I can remember and just a few months later I took a chunk of my saved up money and bought a hard copy of gw2 and still to this day it is one of the few games I regularly return to and still love as much (or more!) than when I first started playing.
---
Soo, coincidence I guess? Or maybe fate?
---
In 2012 a few months after release, I found a Rodgort's Flame. Stupid as I was (and people not knowing back than how rare precursors were) I sold it for 72g. You don't understand. That was a LOT of money back then. It was at a time when 100 gems cost less than 1g. Like an idiot I used that money to buy cultural armor, instead of using it to buy gems.
---
Never dropped another precursor, not even through thousands of mystic forge attempts. Always had to buy.
---
Here's a clip of the figure appearing: https://clips.twitch.tv/TenderInnocentLeopardPeteZarollTie .
---
It appears when the counter hits 31:37:02.
---
It's weird they didn't equip Seimur with vendor feature - especially when he stays near the unlocked station once achievement is completed

Should we place everyone who buys milk on an fbi watchlist?
---
I really, really fail to understand how some of you find the drive to keep playing when the loot in this game is almost non-existant.
---
being able to play in bulk is the key point
---
Yup, I just can't take a screenshot for some reason, it doesn't appear
---
The stream has to end for someone to rewatch it.
---
Dungeon dungeons: everyone just does their own thing. DPS is key and most can be done just by running headfirst into them.
---
Fractal dungeons: At lower tiers, everyone just does their own thing. At higher tiers, it's generally a case that people want a source of quickness, alacrity and healing. Tanks aren't really relevant. 
---
Raids: Tanking mechanics vary, but it's usually the case that there will be one or two dedicated tanks and one dedicated healer, who also should be contributing to DPS and usually boons.
---
Druids are usually welcome because they provide a good amount of healing, lots and lots of might (which gives a significant damage boost) and other decent buffs. Don't just try to camp staff and only heal, though - you also have to generate boons and do your part as DPS.
---
Why not say “ Learn about the next chapter of Guild Wars 2’s Living World story!” And other new features coming to GW2 or and the future of GW2.
---
I think it will be 45 min of explaining why living world will have a different structure this year.
---
Thought it was a cake at first lol. Looks great!
---
That is awesome!

Any tips on keybinds?

That is not correct. You can watch VoDs on twitch for ongoing streams, up to current "chunk". Link to VoD in question, phase happens about 10 seconds from the timestamp:
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/473659419?t=12h01m00s

It doesn't.

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/473659419

&amp;nbsp;  
---
Around the 6:06 mark - although I'm not sure what we're supposed to see.
---
Well that's random. Google doesn't bring up anything relevant, and I can't figure out if that's an anagram of anything either.
---
Could it be just some mishap/error? Can't really see it properly (on mobile) but looks like it's just the stream title and there's nothing new in the actual image.
---
The correct answer is: for you it probably doesnt matter. Core has very low cooldowns (most noticeable the 390 cc on its f1 which is around 10% of its breakbar). In total core does 390 from F1, 130 from mace 3, 300 from mace 5 and 150 from kick and the option to use rampage. This means that core has 970 breakbar in a very short amount of time.
---
If we look at berserker on the otherhand it has 400 from hammer 5 (if target is weakened) 150 from hammer 4, 130 from F1 (if you are in berserk which is not always) and 390 from headbutt. This adds up to 940 or 1070 if you have F1.
---
As you can see the cc is about the same, but as you can see from this log https://dps.report/iIws-20190825-224442_sam the phases in a fast group dont last long. This is where the short cooldowns of core warrior make it superior to berserker.
---
What does this mean for you? Not much. You probably wont join a fast group any time soon as youre a returning player so you mostly stick to pugs I guess so feel free to run berserker
---
&gt;get big Streamers and Youtubers on board,
---
Nah fam. We're good without the "Hitler did nothing wrong" jokes.
---
Great, now I have to watch a timer just to see if something changes *sigh*
---
I *think* my first impression was Tom Chick's site. Someone there, maybe Tom, was able to play a very early alpha, and described his experiences wandering Queensdale, which was just *so weird* for a traditional MMO fan. Heart Quests? Events? What even is this nonsense? 
---
then I checked out some of the race trailers, and I was on board. I pre-ordered, got into the early public beta weekends, loved every minute of them, and have been there ever since.
---
LMFAO she took your dog ?! What in whole craziness is this
---
I knew about the franchise since the announcement of Guild Wars 1. Back then, the screenshots looked astonishing. However, I was but a kid with zero penny, so all I could do back then was drool over the various screens and imagining how good it would've felt to play the game.   
---
Then, when Guild Wars 2 was announced, I had a little bit of money saved so I bought it during the first week. I was super excited.
---
ppl like the game play itself.
---
What I really fail to understand is why ppl that aren't interested in the game spend time on its subreddit.
---
My question is very precise, does the luminous arc's string glow when shooting. I'm not asking for which bow I saw, I'm asking about the luminous arc specifically but it seems no one selected it in the anniversary chest. Didn't get any luck in-game either.
---
Oh no, Icy Nigel is the name the chat gave to the humanoid figure in the fog, not an actual thing that appeared on the stream
---
No.
---
Thats because youre playing a game where you have to interact with other people and where you have the actual possibility of failing anything you do.
---
You didnt get the point of the post did you
---
Yup, some icy statue.
---
Next to those 2 there's also VG and Sabetha that have some clear intended to be ranged mechanics. It's not perfect but it's always been there. Even Matthias could be argued to have some.
---
Why are you even here then? Play another game if you dont like it.
---
Never had a big drop in 7 years
---
couldn't care less, I still manage to eventually get the items I want and I enjoy my time playing regardless.
---
Have you bought the plots after patch, or between unlocking achievement plot and gemstore option being disabled earlier? If in 2nd case, try contacting support with your problem, they should be able to fix that for you.
---
TI TI TI TI, TITITITITIIIIII, TI TI TIIII, TITITITITITITIIII
---
Yeah, I just realized I was looking at a clip lol.
---
Anyways, can't really see the figure on my mobile. Will check it out once I get to a proper PC.
---
I want awareness of this issue, sending them a ticket wont do anything.
---
Dudududu
---
Yeah I see the same shit parroted everywhere. Nobody is considering though the diffirence between expantion level/worthy feature vs expantion *exclusive* feature. Barrier got added with PoF and crowd control with HoT. Not exclusive to an expantion though. Guild halls, mastery system..
---
i checked all thru the stream, this is the only change so far, so im gonna check again tonight. i hope it starts to change more frequently tho hehe
---
A bug report for the garden plots working exactly like they did before the patch?  You don't think ANET was aware of how the garden plots operated before this patch?  Did you also suggest that ANET ban people for taking alts toons and accounts to the different flax farms when HoT dropped?
---
Why dont you just, get it from your anniversary chest lol
---
"  I’ve been watching all the choices you made. " I know what you mean but it got a purpose. People should know that Im not just somebody whos hating on them without even knowing whats going on!
---
it has 2 eyes, and what looks like a cloak or something around in that touches the ground. gives me the impression of something that froze and is maybe kneeling. maybe corrupted ice on an ancient norn statue
---
Let me understand this - you are saying that the *only* character that will have access to the home instance oven will be the one(s) with the chef discipline that have completed the collection - is that right? But that/those chef/*cheves* will have access to it in any home instance he visits, correct?
---
On this episode of shit that goes over your head.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but why would one account need more than one of each crafting discipline? S'all in the family, right?
---
Ok, but what is a nigel?
---
Classmate who was playing the GW1 betas kept telling me about it, but I didn't start getting interested until shortly before the first Wintersday in 2005, when I bought the game.  
---
Played ever since.
---
Link to real gw2 official livestream: https://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2  (time did not change).
---
must be nice to be a nobody on the internet. really easy to simply lump all streamers together and make a pretty harsh assumption without getting a shitstorm against you.
---
Back in the old days when gaming magazines were a thing I read in one of them about GW being a new upcoming MMO that didn't have a subscription and I was like no harm in giving it a shot. Me and a friend joined one of the betas and we both still play today.
---
Why is this useful? Does this have anything to do with the new ascended crafting?
---
9mm of death.
---
You want critique? 
---
First of all you ask them to refocus their attention on the audience that "matters most" gamers. The fuck do you think gamers are?  
---
You mean players that invext thousands of hours into a game to get the most out of the experience? If that is what you want, then I have no clue what you mean by "*it has nothing to do with the content you guys at Arenanet produce*". You want to appeal to people that invest thousands of hours into a game, start by giving them a reason to do so and give those people a challenge. Also if that is what you mean by "gamers" you have an incredibly immature and narrow vision on the general "gaming audience" in 2019
---
Also from some of your suggestion it feels like you've been playing the game a maximum of a year, considering that Anet has already tried most of them. They were at least at E3 2019 and 2016. Goind there without any major news to share is a waste of time and ressources. They partnered with big streamers and youtubers in the past and didn't gain "100 times more" players than they currently do.
---
I agree with an increased investment in twitch, for what it's worth. But you are not even close to the first person to suggest something like this and having this suggestion hidden in a post that reads like an enlightened 14 year old that just discovered that "holy shit you guys, I think expansions are really good for the game", doesn't help.
---
Not a single one of your observations is new and presented in an incredibly condescending way. Add to that, that your logic is all over the place (Advertise to hardcore gamers, but your content right now is definitely not the problem).
---
There, critique
---
Basically this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cultivated_Peppercorn
---
That would be really cool. I wouldn't be able to remain chilled before the announcement if that happened.
---
&gt;  The person who asked the question is being rude, multiple times. 
---
Oh really? He's being rude multiple times? Well let us check real quick.
---
[Can you kindly point where the "multiple times" are here?](http://prntscr.com/oz4dgy)
---
Because it seems like you're basically lying to defend OP. The only rude comment came after OP was being intentionally obscure over and over to egg out more questions, yet somehow you multiplied that one comment into "multiple times"?
---
Even when it became clear the guy was after the infusion OP said "Oh yeah it makes the infusion cover the body, but I won't tell you you which until you ask a 4th time."
---
Good for you.
---
Yes it's just you.
---
Got the Torch precursor last week, very first precursor drop after 7 years of playing, 3,000 hours on the account. Got an Aurene chest and also an ascended coat box from Dragonfall last week as well.
---
I've recently decided to do a rerun of the map completion (something I'd only done once before, on my main). Except, this time, I am playing it entirely RP.
---
I started out in Queensdale, and I am exploring the area. I'm up to a half-dozen maps in the human region. I've decided that my character is something like a Paladin of Dwayna, an itinerant priest in armour who goes from village to village to preach and lend a hand where it's needed. I walk everywhere, either on foot or on a raptor, depending on whether or not I'm in armour (the character is a warrior, but I have one of the city clothing outfits unlocked for the out-of-armor look).
---
It's not something I do for long stretches of time, especially since it does take a while to walk everywhere and avoid waypoints. But an hour or two here or there is very relaxing, and I've found it very immersive so far. I'm discovering plenty of little spots I'd never seen, or never really paid attention to before. Taverns, empty houses, which garrison fort has beds (you gotta look for a place to sleep every night, in a bed if you're lucky, in a barn or by the side of the road if you're not), the usual roads caravan takes (it's nice to travel in company), how far out of Lion's Arch you can find lionguards (gotta know who the local authorities are)... If I use a waypoint, I try to do it in a way that makes sense. For instance, I'll port from one sea-side village to another and imagine I boarded a ship. It gives me a new appreciation for the geography.
---
The only city I've been at so far is Divinity's Reach, but I've just recently started in on Gendarran Fields, and I'm really looking forward to Lion's Arch. By the time I reach it, it's going to feel like a whole new discovery.
---
as you mentioned yourself they forced down our throat dwarfs and asura tech just to now brush you off for a spawn of time. I know you genuinely want to learn more about the Dwarfs, especially if you come from GW1 and Anet gave us(you) a couple of regions here and there with asura tech in Thorns and Dwarves in PoF. 
---
And another point i'd like to make is that Arenanet Living Story is going to the direction that each expansion or story will result to the defeat of an elder dragon. It doesn't give room to explore other minor but even more deadlier factions like we saw in vanilla gw2 with Scarlet mixing Citadel's magic and the Dredge technology. Which means that if the dwarfs drew a different path away from dragons the best and only way we are going to see some action from them is through a raid.
---
well it is a ranged damage weapon used close to the boss.
---
anywhere we can get the STL?
---
Best thing is: if u put it in the raidlobby u might think that everyone will be able to use it.. but as soon as u enter the raid, it despawns.. 
---
I think it should stay in the raidlobby, until the 5 min are over.. 
---
pls fix it anet
---
Imagine new elite specs being announced
---
Tbh I’m sure festival cheap garbage food will be cheap garbage food again when the relevant festival rolls back around.
---
Because it seems like you're basically lying to defend OP. The only rude comment came after OP was being intentionally obscure over and over to drag out more questions, yet somehow you multiplied that one comment into "multiple times"? Do explain how.
---
Even when it became clear the guy was after the infusion OP said "Oh yeah it makes the infusion cover the body, but I won't tell you you which infusion until you ask a 4th time."
---
You feel proud to be part of it because everyone is logging in bursting with nostalgia, circlejerking over how great the old days were and hoping the game will take them back before a time when they still had potential in life.
---
Well first of all, thank you but calm down a little, since I never attacked somebody but made my point about marketing of gw2 on reddit.
---
My point with gamers was not to only look at those who invest thousands of hours into a game (however you got to think that), what I meant was that partnering with coffee and watch shops wont attract the right area of the market, targeting non gaming people is in my eyes the wrong way. 
---
 "*it has nothing to do with the content you guys at Arenanet produce*" YES, as I think the content they produce has a very high quality standart wich can hold onto WoW's. 
---
My points connect! As I said focus more on \*Expansions\* to gain more media attention it connected to almost everything I said, E3 and Gamescom then would be targetable events in which they can show their stuff. Btw they never had big shows at an E3, they were there but nothing more or less.
---
Yes I've not been the first one and this is a topic thats been going on for YEARS, I know. But this only shows how bad they are in making out a good marketing strategy or they just dont listen.
---
All you did was having a one sighted vision and looking down to me, degrade me by saying my text is worthy that of a 14 year old ... Ironic to say the least.
---
they despawn, as soon as the person leaves the raidlobby.. for example to enter a raid.. guess anet expected ppl to use food and then go afk..
---
so no.. the food u need will prpably never be up, unless u start the raid at exactly the same time
---
I played GW1 Prophecies for a bit, but the lack of jumping and everything being instanced content kind of turned me off.  For a while I avoided MMOs altogether, but I did see trailers for Gw2.  At one point I went more towards looter games like Diablo 3, Torchlight, Borderlands, and didn't even bother with an MMO until August of 2017 when I decided to try WoW again after a 7-year hiatus.  That lasted until early Feb 2018 when I quit WoW (for good), and decided to download GW2.   I purchased the expansions 2 weeks afterwards, and have since sunk 3.2k hours into the game.  I still enjoy my daily logins, but like many, if Aug 30th doesn't give me a feeling that ANET has a clear vision for the future, I may just decide to take a break and play other titles.

Who the hell actually checks back with his software publisher?
---
I hope the dog will be OK and you recover him/her soon. Very sorry to hear this, that is the worst thing someone could do to me most likely. Good luck!
---
You know I have never looked at the daily achievements, I'll log in and start in a few minutes.  Thank you very much.
---
I think the story during the LS showed expansion like possibilities,  besides the few mounts, the LS didn’t provide new expansion like content.
---
Season 5 is Frozen Throne, confirmed?
---
Bought Guildwars Factions off the shelf of my local gamestore 13 years ago. The rest is history.
---
I get where you're coming from and I agree that it's a mess, I just don't think it's intentional.
---
What a nightmare that would be.
---
&gt;the content they produce has a very high quality standart wich can hold onto WoW's.
---
Good one.
---
&gt;Btw they never had big shows at an E3

[You sure about that?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkrfShQ7QLE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4395)
---
&gt;however you got to think that
---
Yeah, how could I come to that conclussion when you were so incredibly precise. "Gamers" can mean any of 200 differenty things and appealing to advertise to them is as worthless and broad as you could possibly be.
---
&gt;Well first of all, thank you but calm down a little
---
I am perfectly calm, don't worry. It is, however, impossible to descirbe anything you say as anything but delusional. 
---
I love this game and have played it for 6 years now, but to describe the *content* ArenaNet puts out as "on par with WoW" is hillariously false. Saying "it's not the content" when 90% of the complaints on here and the official forum *AND* map chat is focused on the content is hillariously false. Saying things like "focusing your marketing on an audience that might not have heard about GW2 is wrong", while simultanuously advocating to double down on strategies they have employed since the launch in 2012 is hillariously wrong. Literally all you say is "focus on expansions", like, duh. Have you spent any amount of time on reddit? On the forums? In map chat? That is literally the overwhelming majority opinion and the fact that someone, who expressed that majority opinion, still got downvoted into the shitters might be an indicator that my critizism of "you write like a condescending, enlightened, 14 year old" might not be that far off base.
---
He didn't dodge the one bullet but think of all the other bullets he dodged.
---
Yes! thats what i though
---
I was bored walking around the city waiting for someone. 
---
Sent into magazine shop and sneakily skim read PC Gamer. Their review of gw2 (when it came out) was enticing and I left and immidiately bought the game.
---
But I only played it for an hour.  Not being into rpgs or having any experience with MMOs, I was so lost. (I wish they had the NPE back then).
---
I quit, some months later(shortly before the marionette fight). I logged back in. I'm not sure why. 
---
This time, I stuck with it, join a guild and had someone encourage me to join them doing dungeons(despit being under leveled) to level up and they explained soooo much. I'm grateful to them, but it wasn't until experiencing and beating the marionette fight for the first time, that I decided I actually really like the game xD..and have been here since(minus a year ish break due to health between HoT and PoF)
---
Thanks dude. Very insightful. Lmao I have no idea why people are down voting me for an honest question XD
---
Oh lol I misunderstood your comment and Im really sorry! Ahh no you cant but I dont need one to give criticism to a game I love and followed for 7 years now.
---
I probabpy will juzt watch it first thing when I wake up
---
By my assessment, the main problem with Chrono is that Alacrity is the sort of effect which, from a meta perspective, you'll always want if it's possible to have it. This means that as long as Chrono can provide Alacrity it will need to be balanced around that point, particularly if it's one of the only sources, which can make playing it uncomfortable if you aren't focusing on that part of its kit. The only ways to really avoid the problem are to make Alacrity more ubiquitous, remove it entirely, or make it something internal to Chrono (similar to how Malice works for Deadeye); I personally favor the third option, but there's probably an argument for all three.
---
Nigel now has a friend on the left side as well!
---
Do you actually play wvw at a respectable level or do you just roam for your dailies?
---
We are k8nd of overdue for steve lore. Seven years and we've gotten... one letter of it's name.
---
You can actually do two additional daily achievements and get your free daily 2g on top of it. I do all quick and easy daily achievements just for their rewards that add up over time. Killing a sentry in WvW, watching a vista, daily gatherer, killing a dolyak in WvW, capping a monument in WvW. If I ever need a Gift of Battle, I just pop all the WvW potions I get from the dailies. Karma and crafting materials from the other stuff. I do more little things in my daily routine that, by themselves, don't do much, but combined they really add up and allow you to be prepared for next to everything. Daily crafting cooldowns for charged quartz and ascended materials, for example.
---
Pick a few you feel like doing and weave them into your playtime. Money earns itself in GW2.
---
Condition stacking bring limited to 25 making condition builds balanced ad fit what conditions should be* 
---
There ya go, fixed.
---
Power creep and the insane notion of anets "vision" for the game has created awful balance in every aspect of the game. Wvw has hammer revs, pirate ship bullshut because the aoe damage is no longer the focus, it's rangers and hammer revs pressing 2. Spvp is a shitshow of condi builds for the last year. It's all bad, all of it.
---
I'm going to assume she was hotter than anything we've seen.
---
With all the UI updates, balance changes and datamining, it's either dual classes or more elite specs. I doubt anyone seriously expects no new global class update in an "expansion-worth" release coming at an expansion-like cadence.
---
You are right for wvw, not for pve. Im not sure about pvp. I agree that condition revwmp should be made indicidually for every game mode.
---
They could show a lot of concept art and stuff from revious seasons to fill time.
---
WP just put out a video speculating about the announcement. If he was participating he would be in the loop already.
---
I think you wanted to say trident engi.
---
Looks like a door!!
---
I still need to figure out how to rip out of the game .. I tried using the guide but never would capture ... Thanks for showing these
---
Why?
---
Or, you know. Christmas in Sept.
---
When did the names get decided?
---
I was pretty stoked over the exotic I looted off a dolyak in Frostgorge yesterday.
---
well, it's a stream for an announcement that's been extremely hyped, on which much of the future of the game is based on... Of course it'll attract people, and I sure hope it does, or else it'd be pretty sad
---
Most noteworthy was the Meteorlogicus I put together from a Storm that dropped before the wardrobe change. Didn't even realize it until much later that I had, in fact, gotten a precursor drop in the wild. o_o   
---
Sold it, bought hair kit and vendor contracts and put the rest of the cash toward a Gen 2 legendary. 
---
Most recent was from my alt account. That free chest/key given out this week? Got a friggin' Advanced Cloth Rack. Shipped that to my main and kept it, worth a 70-160 gold when I checked.
---
This is good to hear. The rush to save the world was a bit tiring, I'm all up for a change of pace.
---
TBC please!
---
Saw one guy in twitch chat saying stuff, ctrl + f'd and found a few more messages.

Honestly I'm not getting my hopes up, I'm 99% sure this is complete bull but hey, you never know. Posting here just in case.
---
Nothing definitive has been datamined yet, and the rest could just as well be build templates that have already be confirmed yet. ANet has underdelivered before, so it's not unexpected that not everyone believes elite specs will be there.
---
As long as it's not dual classes I'll be happy at least. If it is dual classes, the balance updates will have been for nothing.
---
I say it has a 50% chance of being correct: it either will be, or wont' be.
---
„No PVP Matches happening“ - Sorry, never encountered that, regardless what time. There is an estimated queue time. If you wait like 2 Minutes longer than that, restart your match search.
---
I play since pre launch 2012. Around 7k hours.
---
Never got a precursore or anything big.
---
Last week tho i got a Chak Egg Sack and i literally rolled around on the floor out of joy :) 
---
It was way over my 300th time killing the Chak Gerrent..
---
To be fair a rifle Ele with Arcane Rifle would look good, bullets could be made from pure elemental energy.
---
I played gw1 for years, but later it was abandoned, just like gw2 will be or already is.
---
Seems like a wishlist. We'll know more tmrw
---
Lying, am I? It seems to me that you're being willfully obtuse. It's pretty clear that said person very early on interpreted the OP's answers very negatively in the way they responded. But if you can't see that I can't help you.
---
*squints eyes on the animation*
---
Ehhh....
---
I think I'll leave that to you people...
---
That is not true thought:
---
* If you play sPvP/WvW even if you are not playing the new spec you will have to learn about it. After a new expac there is usually a huge uproar with different builds being discovered, declared broken (often just because people haven't figured out the appropriate counters yet) and then the meta settles down and people complain about its staleness. One at a time would allow people to focus on on spec, learn its counters and tells even when not playing it and the meta would keep adapting every couple of month. Post release balance could also focus on the one new spec rather than 9 and thus probably produce better results.
---
* In PvE teamcomps and thus ideal builds could change affecting people who do not play the specific class as well.
---
And on top of that: if you dont happen to play the released class you still have the other new content. And if all of them are released at the same time you are left out similarly as you only experience 1/9 of the new content that way.
---
They give you 5 to try and get you to buy another garden plot. Way to show anet, greedy punks.
---
Cantha coming this September, with everything teasing towards Jormag and Shiverpeaks? ANet would have to be monumentally stupid to tease one thing then do the opposite.
---
Models that Kiza prints are not ripped from the game. He models it himself.
---
If we would get elite specs, maybe we can choose one every episode. So you can play your main class first with the new elite.
---
Seems like a wishlist. Especially the Cantha part. Until they talked about elite specializations it all seems plausible though.
---
Not gunna lie, pistols or rifle on ele would be pretty awesome
---
I got an All Seeing from the high priestess once, back when they were 200 gold. I got 2 precursor from the forge, that's about it.
---
Never trust twitch.
---
can i get a banana for scale?
---
Cantha will never happen. Sooo definitely fake
---
Shiverpeaks for S5, Cantha for expac.
---
Twitch chat.
---
Agreed that it has to draw people, I want this game revitalized. My point was a timer counting down from 30 something hours, a bit of music has drawn more viewers than "how to draw..., play with dev, whats ur fav mini" streams. I expect thousands of people to join in tomorrow for the reveal.
---
twitch.tv/guildwars2
---
Much clearer in motion. If you still can't see anything there besides a snowstorm you must be snowblind.
---
Here's an updated Content &amp; Feature Chart [from 2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7147bq/i_left_guild_wars_2_during_what_changed_a/), with stuff updated and categories moved around a bit. If you feel something important missing/incorrect, please to let me know in the comments so that I can update it.
---
The latest existing version of the chart will be posted [here on my website](http://www.nojamtoday.com/eng/guild_wars_2/). I'll likely make an update after LWS5 announcement with corrections (if any) and the new planned stuff, but I wanted the chart to be out by that moment already.
---
Also, if imgur forces you a to small image on mobile, try [this direct link](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_36.png) instead.
---
Eh. That's so vague it may as well be true. Most of the stuff we know already anyway and them announcing an expansion that's going to come after S5 is well within the possibilities.
---
Can you tell who placed a BO on the TP?!
---
Ye ye, the figure is quite clear, but where do you guys see the names?
---
Just gonna throw this out there for everyone else's sanity:  
---
In group content, don't use Longbow skill #4 unless your life depends on it. If people are engaged in melee and they see fire that off, they *will* lowkey hate you for it. 
---
Also, you can keep longbow as a weapon swap, but it's recommended to have a melee weapon as well for those times the enemy has projectile-reflects and so you can get buffs from the melee characters. 
---
Otherwise, welcome to the game! :)
---
Arenanet marketing department 10/10. Taxi ad never forget.
---
Oohhhhhhhh. Okay. Now THAT's clear. I watched [this clip.](https://clips.twitch.tv/TriumphantShinyGooseOptimizePrime)
---
Thanks for the link! I genuinely cleaned my glasses thinking I'm just fucking blind.
---
Thanks will do, looking at them now
---
It's not exactly what I am looking for, because I imagine it feels kind of artificial with all the self-restrictions you have to make. But I'll give it a try right now! ;-) If you wanna add me ingame: "Iron Marracuda"
---
Probably a permanent contract.
---
Would still be a waste of the Shiverpeaks, and contradicts what the person said in their 'leak'.
---
Yeah bull
---
Going to start getting interesting in the markets now...looks like about 400k peppermint rolls left near 1 silver/ea and then a bit of an air pocket on the rest of the foods up to about 1.5s/ea.
---
The model is not ripped though. I created it in blender. It's based on the concept art of the shield https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:The_Flameseeker_Prophecies_concept_art.jpg Looks quite a bit different from the game.
---
Really shows how weak PoF was
---
It's been appearing more and more as the timer gets lower.
---
Eh. Expa before March 2020, new PvE content (Cantha, new elite specs + LS 5 at September. It's everyone's guess of the 'new PvE content' is meant for the expansion or LS5.
---
I only see Joko upon an icy throne.
---
Praise Icejoko.
---
According to http://bananaforscale.info/ it's 0.702 bananas.
---
By the time it releases mobile will be so out of date. The next gaming industry push will be “don’t you guys have smart watches?”
---
Holy shit that's some difference for four hours. We'll probably have a clear picture at the evening if it keeps going like that.
---
The second comment literally says 'Cantha is coming on September'.
---
Well, the names are what chat "decided" them to be. ;)
---
Latest hotfix fixed this apparently
---
Wow that WvW Map neglect. [when compared to the rest of most game modes]
---
I mean there's an option of building 20 diff ascended sets and play the game differently with the specs u got and its gona be !"unique"...
---
I think there is just more appearing in the background, not necessarily everything that's here becoming more clear.
---
Big brain
---
Are you kidding me? Yes 2015 but whats about now? People outside of Gw2 dont even know what Living World is, they think "ohh its just a monthly update with some features" Theres no huge reason to come back or get into the game, especially when you advertise Living World so poorly.
---
I think you misunderstood the conzept of a forum, its there to critizise the game OFC people will get their opinion on certain topics. Have you ever thought about how they should increase the amount of content and its quality if they are on a decreasing track of income? For me Gw2's features, let them be small or big are unique in the mmo market and thats why I said its quality is at WoW's. 
---
" Saying things like "focusing your marketing on an audience that might not have heard about GW2 is wrong" "
---
I NEVER said that but obviously you wont understand what I mean... It almost seems like you play dumb... I said that promoting Gw2 via a WATCH SHOP wont help Gw2 in terms of growth ... In economy you always wanna get the best outcome for YOURSELF wich means ... in an example of Gw2: 10 People can win a Gw2 watch, approx 1k people sign up and get awareness of this watch shop now think about how many people of this watch shop got awareness of Gw2.. If I had to guess, not that many people interested in watches will hop on Gw2 and looks what its like... Gw2 made nothing out of this deal thos its bad marketing!
---
"while simultanuously advocating to double down on strategies they have employed since the launch in 2012 is hillariously wrong"
---
YES cuz its BAD and they start loosing more and more people than they gain trough their marketing.
---
Lol no I did not spend a lot of time on reddit, yes but I can still tell my opinion like others do, thus I dont care what the majorities opinion is since I got my own. You are one of those persons who drag this stuff way to close to their heart, thats not healthy and I got to know that by the hard way since Ive always been the one who defended Gw2 like a real fanboy.
---
Only thing bad you did was ignore her, but yeah, pointing the door was for the best. Hopefully support can help you.
---
A girl breaking in someone else's house? Not possible in the country where I live. She must have had a a key or know where he hides them.
---
Yeah especially since things like Raids and Fractals are already grouped together.
---
Ele would be perfect! Ele is considered the meta DPS wise, and is also often used as healer in raids, becoming slowly even more popular as healer than Druid’s.
---
Timothy (the left one) reminds me very much of original art of a necromancer, the one with kneeling evil asura.
---
Whoops, you're right. That's what I get for staring at the upper one all the time. Okay then. Still might work out, S3 started out in the Maguuma and ended in Orr. S4 started out in Elona and ended in the middle of the sea. S2 was basically everywhere in core Tyria.
---
*shrugs*
---
But I get what you're saying.
---
Its the same for me, cant for sure say why.
---
Maybe because everything is so slow and you hanh out often on each hub and make they same way dozen of times.
---
It feels more real then using waypoints all the time and only going somewhere once.
---
While design whise it may be clunky that you often have to run 3 times to the same place for one single quest chain in wow classic, it really gives a heavy feel about everything you do and accomplish.
---
It's so strange wow classic makes so much right by doing it kinda wrong.
---
They're Icebrood. I think people are getting too excited.
---
Shows how forgettable the 2v2 maps are. There's not much for PvP maps even if you count the forgotten 2v2 map.
---
&gt; I know that I used to be a support character in BDO and now I prefer playing melee with a dagger in this game. Give yourself time to try out how a new weapon feels and what kind of build feels nice to you.
---
This. 
---
I'm usually caster/ranged/healer in other MMOs and adventure games, but what felt right for GW2 was an in-the-face warrior with a hammer. (Not meta, but idgaf, and it's gotten a lot better as a weapon over the years.) And since then, I've played all sorts of builds among all the professions.   
---
Besides, ranger gets a greatsword attack that summons a spiritual bear to maul people. It's hard for me to say no to that.
---
Hm, if you are indeed interested, the linked tumblr has my contact info or reddit pm works as well. I am currently preparing a night themed version for Ipos to send to a friend. Trying out a finish / varnish for the coloring. So it'll be much more robust for packaging and mailing.
---
After that I am open for commissions. :3
---
Its the fact that you didnt mention its not in a good spot, why would someone who even wants a dedicated pvp game mode want to come to a game where its been neglected for years by the developers. If you want a game to play raids and want really hard content to grind your teeth into why play gw2 when Anet makes a wing every 9 months only for the lastest one to be easier than every single one that came before it. Same with fractals too Anet has basically made it clear they ever make another fractal CM. GW2 isnt that kind of game so if you arent that kind of player its best you know that now instead of a year from now and 2 expansions later.
---
I really hope they wont do the expansion like LW updates. A new expansion isnt only exciting but also brings alot new players with them. Good marketing isnt really the strength of arenanet and i have the fear that the playerbase will just slowly erode away over the time, if they only keep on releasing lw episodes.
---
There's supposed to be one more, but not weird that it's forgotten with how neglected the mode is.
---
It looks like the list grows a lot at the far right, but a lot of it is just fluff and filler
---
That a throne/statue or a figure in the middle bottom?
---
My thing didn't run on my thing.
---
Suggestions?
---
I think the OMEGALUL emote rom the screenshot is enough to comment on this
---
I can also point out that my non-chefs dont have the station in the instance at all.
---
MO has stated through out the game that dragons are the focus of Guild Wars 2. Look at the logo.
---
I wouldn't mind them releasing 3 specs every 2 weeks.
---
IMO it definitely got better, but the release cadence is just shit.
---
That's pretty much what has stopped me from playing. I played daily for the best part of 5 years, then LS4 just added a ton of timegated, poor grindy collections as 'content' and it put me right off.
---
I've still not done the Skyscale collection.
---
Mostly shows how HoT was a feature pack that "laid the foundation", and PoF was a content pack with one major mechanic that changed all of the game dramatically.
---
That said, I can share the sentiment that after HoT, PoF was an undesired spin for many. Too samey, too solo, not enough repeatable content with good rewards.
---
Commission was done five years ago by /u/kurururu, felt it was relevant again considering the upcoming content.
---
[Ingame look](https://i.imgur.com/A2HnJ4I.jpg)
---
I was just joking. Just a jab at how WP can take the smallest bits of information and put together hours of content. But of a worn out meme tbh
---
Nice!
---
its just a copy/pasta troll post. its nothing. move on. and dont believe all these "positive" posts in twitch chat about the game either. its even more trolling from the obvious toxic part of the com...
---
Maybe it's a red herring. Maybe we don't do the entire Jormag arc. Heavens, maybe it's not about Jormag at all! The guy's asleep! Maybe we fuck around with Jormag's Scarlet and then have to go to Cantha. Not that I'm keen on Cantha. I'm tired of the GW1 Memorial Lane. I'm just saying...
---
*cough* But I could get behind a Cantha cronenberg army invading the Far Shiverpeaks and we having to pool our resources with the Son's of Jormag. *cough*
---
I declare that this 2m dollar manison on the mountainside is my homeland!!!!!
---
If they could make edible glow in the dark paint, i'm sure it be a hit at black light parties.
---
&gt; fluff and filler
---
To be fair, most of things mechanically imaginable that *could* be done were already done with HoT. That's how frameworks work.
---
I mean, what *can* be done after mounts and 9x2.5 specs? All that's left is patching the occasional holes, or breaking stuff down and replacing it altogether, or just adding fluff and filler.
---
This is my current thought. Icebrood in norn animal forms like Svanir was in bear form.
---
Don't forget to make some footage as well, I always enjoy those!
---
Thank the gods tbh. I've always hated that food prices were so cheap. I actually have a reason to go pick those onions now.
---
If it were a red herring it'd be poorly executed. You don't point literall everything towards something and then go 'haha really fooled you guys'.
---
Jormag is not necessarily asleep anymore. Its minions don't suddenly become more active. Would be a real copout not to involve Jormag now.
---
So far it's been finished for months and no release date in sight. They might not ever launch it.
---
Go to the Raid Academy discord
---
Anyone who get's the message:  **“this app can’t run on your PC, to find a version for your PC, check with the software publisher”**
---
I'm not sure. 
---
I honestly think at this point they're more likely to announce a new game than a new expansion. The game is really showing it's age, especially when it comes to performance, and we see the devs struggling with the now archaic game engine with each new release.
---
to me it sounds like OP is more at fault. all signs point that he is a game addict that threw away his real world relationship for a bunch of pixels. 
---
OP's future is locking himself up in his basement playing games and eating doritos until he dies of heart attack and noone will care
---
Let's be real, the reason Classic is demanded is because gamers have really shitty memory and don't recall that vanilla was garbage that was only good in relation to its competition and the nonexistent standards of its era.
---
I heard Plebs In The Void \[QQ\] is recruiting again you might wanna give them a shot.
---
They are looking for new players so that they can move on to killing end bosses in various wings.
---
Definitely fake, cantha on LS5 is not happening. 
---
Just look at the official countdown on twitch, it definitely points to Shiverspeak.
---
can you unlock if you 425 on others ?
---
&gt; The framework has been laid, so why is the release cadence still going down?
---
Two possibilities:
---
* Because ANet decided that since it freed up their time, they could throw resources at making a mobile game and what not instead.
---
* Because LWS5 is really awesome and full of great new features.
---
Let's hope it's more of column B than column A.
---
It would be stupid though, to hype people up for something then deliver something completely different. 
---
It's like trying to surprise people for dinner by saying they'll get steak, then suddenly delivering fish. Can still be good, but people who were really looking forward to steak will be disappointed for sure, and those are the ones that would be coming in the first place.
---
wonder what this is.. [O_O](https://i.imgur.com/rvHAQ4q.jpg)
---
It'd be a huge waste not to involve Jormag when doing Shiverpeaks. Otherwise there's not much room to go back when we eventually get to it.
---
Insider trading and knowledge of patch changes has been huge with GW2 pretty much since launch.
---
Such science. Many data point.
---
It is the thingy being shown in the countdown now. Looks like this will be a charr episode too
---
I wouldn't mind build templates,but they're basically a small QoL change without much significance. It's not like the GW2 of 2013 where there were a million traits you could do with as you please. Is it so hard to memorize 2-3 templates and then switch to them on-the-fly? It takes literally 10-20 seconds to change your build around; having a button do it for you is cool and all, but nowhere near as revolutionary as people make it out to be.
---
Having typed all of that out, i must admit I've only been thinking about traits... If build templates would also involve gear sets, runes, and skill bar layouts, then that would be useful.
---
There's snow in the countdown thingy. Looks like w're going to the Shiverpeaks.
---
I love teasers like these! Where they change in real time so you can come checking back every so often. It's really fun. Maybe stuff like this in game too?
---
Any build works for open world PVE so have fun with whatever you choose. For the rest of the content: I think longbow ranger is fantastic, my main since the start of the game. I do all the story content on her and most of it is fine. There are some story instances that are a pain to do on a ranged character. I run around in WvW capturing camps and doing fine. For group content (and a few story instances) I switch to melee (sword and warhorn, there are other options). 
---
On those days that I don't want to shoot from long range I switch to one of my 5 alts. My GS Guardian likes to look into the eyes of her enemies before she kills them :-)
---
Four's* because she didn't do anything.
---
I’m trying but anet won’t stay in my wells
---
Thanks for compiling all of this, I never know which one is new or not! It's all very interesting, I'm liking the vibe from the new tracks so far
---
Don't remember the whens, but over the years i had several items drop that were worth 50g and above. Not a single  precursor in 7 years, but a 250g sword once.
---
If we stare at it long enough we could see anything... :o)
---
ahahah, if it's Cantha instead, I can tell you the overwhelming majority of people will love the surprise
---
Human takes 3 days if you don't just buy heat stoners. And you need the meat from the charr line to do the asura line. So do human or norn, charr, asura.
---
what does the scribe vendor not have that you would need?  sorry I don't make stuff with scribe often..
---
Hey, don't knock it. Every little helps.
---
Oooh. I had an /r/woooosh moment there.
---
"Templates (1-2 free slots, more with gems)" This looks like arenanet.
---
Oh, this is amazing, saving for later:-)
---
&gt; my previous main,
---
What happened? Fell off an icy cliff?
---
I play on and off, ~2k hours over that time. I check my items reasonably frequently (several times per hour).
---
No, it's something else.
---
We've got rideable dragons...
---
We're going to fight a terror in the North...
---
...Winter is coming.
---
Naaa pistol mainhand. Condi focused. A new busted version of one shot chrono and CI Mirage combined!!
---
Followed by nerfs for the next few years to chrono’s QoL
---
mhm that's why I said it will vary person to person. There are those like you, who won't touch another human centric story, and those like me who would prefer it.
---
No they consistently hinted towards Jormag. Adding special in-game NPCs to quite a few maps and to Dragon Bash to say how Dragon has been calling them. Giving every mail and announcement about the expansion a snow theme. Now slowly revealing what seems to be frozen silhouettes in a snow countdown stream.
---
They have hinted a ton at what's in it.
---
Imagine an elite spec called Icy Nigel.
---
Wow this is a pretty nice tune
---
An Elder Dragon that's busy with the cosmic balance. Maybe this time, it's just us? And some threat in the Far Shiverpeaks. Braham talks to us, the Demi-God Commander, and we can hardly tell him, again, to shove it. So it's all...a bit more small-time, you now.
---
Not enough?
---
Nah, I might need it for later.
---
oh this got updated? :o
---
i had forgotten this existed
---
TLDR for the non weebs?
---
But why not just elite specs? Speargun is basically rifle and shares most skins with rifles. Trident same with staff. Spear can also be incorporated into staff, albeit a bit harder.
---
Elites can also easily repurpose already available weapons for the class. An elite that changes Ele staff into melee for example. Elites are often designed to be used with their specific weapon anyway.
---
You'd just be substituting Underwater weapons with a severe lack of skins for weapons that could do exactly the same. It'd be a lot of effort for something that could be done just as well just as easily.
---
[deleted]
---
Rightfully so. ;)
---
I've been playing gw2 since release and had literally never heard of this guy until this erp no support from anet bullshit popped off a few days ago.
---
Why should the game suffer from this person’s (alleged) crime? 
---
Jeremy Soule’s music was what pulled me into Guild Wars. Literally the reason I’m playing - that I’ve immediately got nostalgic for Oblivion 
---
If he is proven guilty, then obviously don’t work with him in the future (besides, it’s hard to find employment when you are in prison), but there is no need to ruin the existing soundtrack
---
Unless the leaks are accompanied by screenshots, and a lot of them, I don't believe any leaks.  The leaks for PoF were very obviously real leaks.
---
It's an Icebrood. Clearly the story will go around the followers of Jormag. I can forsee a new playable "race" maybe? Would be nice! Let's hope it adds a new lvl up tutorial.
---
While I loved many of the changes WoTLK brought to the game (and my preferred spec), TBC was the best of times and the worst of times.
---
&gt; we both make assumptions while
---
The difference between our assumption is that you are assuming the devs don't know how the nodes work, while I assume they do.  One is clearly more likely than the other. 
---
&gt; since every single account can provide 12h worth of ascended food feasts, more than enough to cover the average daily game time
---
Let's just assume for the sake of argument that this is true (which it is not, because not everyone has cooking max'd and many do not even plan to work toward this).  So what?  
---
&gt;  if the home instance owner doesnt harvest them at all
---
Then this just lessens the "flood" that you are so alarmed by.
---
That's just Waldo; nevermind him, he just took a wrong turn.
---
Cozy little ship that the weeb family traveled in since the very beginning falls apart because the journey gets crazier and crazier and just becomes too much for it, so it slowly falls apart, captain makes the tough call, the mechanic flips his shit because his blood and tears and sweat and love have been put into the dingy cute lovely little thing, dramadramadramadramadramadramadramadrama, story arc climaxes, dingy little hearty lovely thing does one last voyage and goes down in a blaze of glory milking the "i love you my nakama" like there is no tomorrow, shattering the heart of every living being capable of emotion. RIP
---
Nigel = baby ice dragon mini, 600 gems on the Gem Store.
---
PrIce Joko.
---
I'm interested in the bit where the dev was about to talk about the lost Abaddon fractal before stopping himself and saying "hmm we wont talk about that". He was talking about the evon/ellen election. 
---
Straight afterwards you can tell he think he fucked up coz he stops talking and nervously laughs to himself. 
---
I think we can expect the Abaddon fractal soonish to be honest.
---
Not sure if people have noticed, but something is becoming visible!
---
Check out the vod from earlier in the timer!
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/473659419](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/473659419)
---
Nah. It's really small time. If you go from giant threats to basically nothing, everything feels forced. It's part of the reason why WoW BfA was not well received story wise initially, and why they're moving back towards the old gods insanely fast. It's why FFXIV went towards an even bigger threat than last expansion that's literally about the existence of the world. 
---
We've slain three elder dragons. Nothing is even close to that level of threat. Why would we have any trouble with threats of a much smaller caliber (unless it's buildup towards a dragon)? Why would there be any stakes involved when we can basically beat anything? Especially with aurene as a backup plan, we have no idea what she's doing but we're still connected to her.
---
Aurene's stomach was only a setback.
---
Its not that big they weren't just going to use it for episode 6 a lot of new stuff added in living world is used to make other episodes.
---
The stress and/or depression or whatever was in the air was obviously to see, it was very awkward to watch. And idk what's going on with rubi but it looks very unhealthy :x
---
That's just over 5 years of listening to GW2 music leaking XD
---
Considering her reaction, it was probably some thot-club. Loud shitty music, piss all over the toilets, sugary cheap but overpriced drinks, bleached twats in their early 20s and bad airconditioning. No view.
---
I wouldn't believe this at all, But I'll play along. On tuesday there was an item in the black lion chests that had no use and has since been removed. It was cordyceps which is a parasitic fungi which of the 400 species most are found is asia. Cantha Confirmed. They are the fungi that turn bugs into "zombies" and was what made the clickers in the Last of us.
---
Plz let it take the place of the underwater fractal
---
Honestly if I saw this coming back I’d second guess it. This is kinda daunting
---
There were also [THIS](https://clips.twitch.tv/BrainySleepyCrocodilePicoMause)
---
I've always hated snow in every aspect. Living in Canada, I got my fair share of snow and I dislike that it's cold and wet. I also hate that it makes everything more difficult (driving, walking etc.). I collects dirt very easily and makes everything look incredibly dirty (kind of like when you have white furniture that shows dirt more easily).
---
In a video game sense, I find it just doesn't look very good. I'd rather see vibrant colors of green, blue etc. than see white as far as the eye can see.

I also find that the constant snow effect has a detrimental effect on my PC's performance which is already arguably lower than it should be for this game.
---
You can extrapolate either way: Google is useless because we need to keep asking the questions to generate answers and to prevent them from being outdated. So why ever use Google?
---
The practical analysis is this: there are billions of people on the internet. There's only 1 in millions of chances that you're the first one to face the problem or that all the current answers available are outdated and can't fix it.
---
If you use Google first, you'll very likely find the answer to your problem immediately without having to wait for other people's answers, and the step-by-step fix will be far more detailed and easy to understand. In the very unlikely scenario where the top 3 fixes can't solve your problem, then you can ask your question with far more detailed information like "I tried XXXX, YYYY and ZZZZ and I'm still having the same issue", which will increase your chances of having an effective answer.

This post is the epitome of laziness. OP literally copied the message into the title and that's all. Absolutely no further information provided (like his Windows version, if he uses addons like the DX12 DLL, et cetera)
---
Man he must be furious, I sure hope we get to see this

anger of the undead necroancer regent
---
Wrong that would be pay-to-win. Stop trolling.

---
It sure looks like a Charr to me, especially since it looks like there's at least three. That's the making of a warband!
---
Why though why add new weapons when elite specs add a new weapon, new trait lines, new utilities, new mechanics, new elite skill, new runes. If they are going to add a new weapon to each class go the whole hog and add a completely new elite spec.
---
Wasn't aware of his current status with Anet, if that is the case then I guess that's fine. Had they been currently involved with him I would have liked a statement, not that it would make much difference but I appreciate when people/companies stand up for the victims of sexual abuse. It's gotta be hard to come forward, especially against someone famous and beloved for his work, plenty of people in this very thread casting doubts and making disparaging comments. But since they already have cut ties with him then that's probably enough.
---
Can't have anything clipping if you can't see the charr at all \o/
---
I got swept up in all the marketing and hype that Guild Wars 2 had leading into launch.  I'd never played Guild Wars 1, but I was drawn to GW2's art style, their promises of no gear treadmill, and their goal to encourage cooperation, rather than competition, with randos you meet in the open world.  At the time I was broke though, so I didn't end up getting it until Christmas that first year.
---
I think we'll go to the Homelands in season 5. Maybe Jormags reach begins to go there like Mordremoth managed to reach the Iron Marches. Also interesting though is the central transfer chamber from GW1 is in the Far Shiverpeaks so maybe we will be able to return there.
---
So we’re headed for a shitty ass ending then? Goddammit
---
Thanks. I hope there won't be any more soon.
---
Can't blame you, it's been 2 years.
---
The northern green areas have several Herbs and they gave me a ton of cloves.
---
The dedicated gardener is specifically for the black lion plots, as is the vendor part of the gardener NPC in your home instance. What you need is seeds that drop from herb nodes around Tyria, you plant these in your garden and they'll grow into the ascended plants.
---
Ah... Awesome! I can finally fill that empty plot.

&gt;Is [milk](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/milk-white-supremacy-racism_n_5bffad35e4b0864f4f6a3e28?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADvqLw-6MxSjz36g5PfPAr3Y3Gc-etCIQygL_eExp3bRAhMDUITd0oiHXhNCap1hIKyG1-v8jzQLjQnNfDA49b0GzSg3Kcdkzcz7bj_MDnXP4rWTNqTYPvcepwP7vHlCx1Sn0Nxoakt7VgIpjgOMFKboIhwaaCoyXbtC0UIUJYnU) also a [common](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/white-supremacists-science-dna.html) white nationalist virtue signal?
---
I'm curious. Did you actually read what you linked? Because in neither article does anyone say "ARGLEBARGLE THEY DRINK MILK THEY MUST BE RACIST!"
---
Instead they simply point out completely factually that specific people who advocate violence against non-white people and Jews as open white supremacists, are tagging their posts with milk and chugging it on camera, because white supremacists again use it as indicator for really stupid reasons. 
---
Literally no one is saying "They drink milk and say OK? They are racist." Instead they are correctly noting "Hey, the losers who think their race makes them smarter than other people are drinking milk on camera now and here's why." Because despite with 4chan losers think, people are actually capable of putting things in context. 
---
&gt;Should we place everyone who buys milk on an fbi watchlist?
---
Neither article suggests anything of the sort. No one is. It's a strawman, the kind again meant to provide cover for people who say that society would be more peaceful and civilized if we got rid of people based on their melanin levels. When they start spouting white supremacist talking points and posting Pepe memes and chugging milk, people correctly call them out, and their fans cry out "Lol you got trolled! You only think their racist because of milk and OK! Because you claim it's something racists are doing!"
---
Yes, it is something racists are doing. That's a fact. But we identify them based on words and actions, not the signals alone. For example, when I see people with 88 in their name espousing problematic views, I know that either they are a fan of Hitler and racism, or they simply were born in 88. So I check their post history before responding. Their words indicate what their beliefs are. 
---
Incidentally, while neither article suggests at all putting people on a watchlist because they drink milk, there is a person suggesting we create watchlists to remove people's rights based on scans of social media posts. The same person who suggested seizing guns first and engaging in due process later. The same person who specifically told government agents to break the law to seize property and hell pardon them as needed. The same person who has banned people from government service based on their gender identity. 
---
I don't dislike people because they drink milk. I dislike them because of what they do and say to show ignorance and cruelty to others.
---
I just hope we're not being over hyped... I'm definitely far from one of the many doomsayers this sub has seen recently, but even I would be pretty disappointed if all this countdown stuff led to not much being revealed.
---
Looks like a redesigned icebrood dog, maybe?  Or a icebrood Charr; that'd be pretty dope.
---
Only 21.5 mins? Wheres the real WP video? :D
---
Isn't it obviously clearly a charr ? It has the charr face, the hunched back, the horns and even the Charr's spiky hair.  
---
It IS a charr. Flame legion ?
---
Maybe it is forgotten because of community actively asked to not implement any new map ever again.
---
Yes but 3 hours ago it wasn't clear.
---
Its a clip from 10 hours ago.
---
Let's not forget their bases in metrica, caledon (unreachable), kessex (secret), brisban, mount maelstrom, gendarran fields (two secret bases here, one made for the aetherblades), the secret one in LA they had along the Aetherblades.
---
And there's also other hidden bases that or may not have been inquest, like the one in Fireheart Rise and the one in Timberline falls.
---
Building facilities and labs all over the place seems to be like 1/4 of what asura do, and they spread all over the world using whatever they can, so Inquest or a solitary asura having some secret base anywhere to research is never out of character.
---
I was introduced by my friends a few years ago when they told me they played a game where they met "the world's ugliest furry" who took all his clothes off for them, and also that you could make a character with a mushroom head. I was hooked instantly.
---
It'd be interesting if the snow stopped at some point and they started melting.
---
Put it this way last week I was in a 5 man Fractal group with a ranger that loved his legendary long bow and legendary  short bow and was doing as much damage as our healer.
---
HEAVENSWARD Calling it now.

Thanks! Help me to dig into specific wiki pages!
---
The enjoyment of the story by the games playerbase is more important than the subjective quality of that story. I don't really care if it's about people being the hero, or just a random adventurer, the stupid thing is going back from the first to the second. 
---
It's jarring to go from high to low stakes. It's jarring to go from being important to being just another dude. When there's precedent for stuff, you need to not ignore it in future story for the sake of plot convenience. That's what makes a story truly shit. 
---
It's like how GoT trivialized big threats, never actually finished the arc of the big heroes by ignoring precedent, and turned previously amazing characters into dumb caricatures of themselves for plot convenience.
---
Maybe we could get a merchant contract for him as another home instance unlock.
---
Go to the BLHQ in LA, talk with an NPC there there, pay for the supply contract, then Seimur gets the Master Chef vendor shop.
---
Chat full of furries?
---
The figure down the countdown is not a charr but a dwarf. Mark my words.
---
Part of them asked for no maps. But since all we got were maps, the mode's neglected now. The last substantial thing introduced were automated tournaments, and after that only undelivered promises.
---
Chat's actually quite interesting right now.
---
&gt;specs around the region  
---
saltychrono: we don't have any leaks tho  
---
Turboradik81: The reason why the "hardcore" commuinty as opposed to the tublr/casual community is that the hardcore always just rush trough content without appreciating the small details which makes the game awesome. They also tend to be more lazy than the tumblr community as we are able to create our own fun trough RP and art and the likes while hardcore raiders rely on others (devs) time for everything they do.  
---
Direct Relief - Charity 2018BenLubar: people are saying it's rytlock but that would mean they killed rytlock offscreen which I find very unlikely  
---
VerifiedWoodenPotatoes: a dwarvern story would be better suited to primordus content than jormag  
---
dhau: Bring back Prince Rurik!  
---
cruxxferemar: at min. 24 flames will be seen in the background. primordus crossing the snowstorm. youll see ;)  
---
TurboDebaros: So an icy region would mean elite specs that thrive there  
---
Jollegp: please!  
---
cruxxferemar: hour 24 i mean *  
---
narnarthemoth: @Kwisek Not a frozen charr land but that season 5 would take place in charr lands.
---
unseen0000: @WoodenPotatoes Also. now that i have you reading this. I just wanna say i love you and appreciate your time and effort. You're one of the reasons i'm still actively playing 7k hours in. &lt;3  
---
De9zT: k  
---
VerifiedWoodenPotatoes: hardcore raider usually = log in once a week, spend the other six days QQing. it's not actually that hardcore but people like to identify themselves in camps they don't belong tbh  
---
Direct Relief - Charity 2018pufferzsola: @michram YES!  
---
Direct Relief - Charity 2018BenLubar: @michram what would your abilities be as kormir rev? leaving whne people need you?

unseen0000: ^^  
---
Twitch PrimeTherenar: True LUL  
---
Kwisek: @WoodenPotatoes they can connect both, Dwarfs with Primo and undeground fights under Northern Shiverpeaks, and Charrs homeland with Jormag  
---
saltychrono: monday and sunday raids, rest of week fractals and doing things with guild
---
For all we know, Jormag might as well be sleeping like a baby and it’s actually Drakkar calling the shots
---
It’s the Canthan Emperor with a big coat and fake horns.
---
I hope someone has been recording this to repost it in a video x100 times faster so it's easier to see if there's progressive change.
---
I think trying to force feed the player base the idea that living world with expansion like content is enough, regardless of how they dress it up would have catastrophic consequences for the future of GW2. This idea was tried in one form or another and backfired on them and the player base would never trust they could do it or that the results would meet the promises.
---
I would be shocked if NCSoft would buy into this because like it or not, the huge cash injections that come from expansions have been a staple in the MMO history, and certainly in NCSoft's history.
---
Expecting a rehashed concept to be welcomed with open arms despite any assurances they could try and give the player base would result in their own version of the Immortal debacle Blizzard endured and would send their stocks plummeting, just like it did for Activision.
---
If you turn off Chef on either of them, do you lose the cooking station?
---
New to the game. Going to start as a Ranger - and I'm thinking on either Salvari or Norns. I enjoy eye-candy and relaxed atmosphere. The Salvari sounds like 'Night-Elves' in wow for me. Forest people, everything green around, relaxing music. Norns - Snowy mountains, beautiful alpine views.
---
Or at least that's how Imagine that. People who played both can state what they liked/hate in each - and which had a better starting zones to keep me hooked early on with quests/story?
---
Also, I know there's personal story in the world. Are there 'World' quests that are detached from the personal quest-line? Wow 'forced' me to investigate every section of the zone, because it might have a hidden NPC with a hidden quests. Is this also happening in GW? Or all quest are giving by NPC one after the other?
---
It's Balthazar disguised as dwarf disguised as Joko disguised as Kormir disguised as quaggan disguised as sand disguised as Ho-ho-ho disguised as "Yes who is this" disguised as Collin Johandsome disguised as Poobadoo disguised as what the hell am I doing with my time disguised as Pavlova disguised as "???" disguised as weird cosmic mushroom disguised as Rytlock's fur disguised as a charr.

This.
---
I do not remember how I got there, but guild wars was free for a weekend, I tried it, and then instantly deleted all other free mmos I had been trying until then, and went to buy the game.
---
Oh yeah I know. It's just that I prefer a consistent narrative that actually deals with it's threats than rushing them to go back to random adventuring.
---
There's bound to be some who desperately want to believe it on this sub, even with the start of that comment.
---
Also means half of Dragon's Watch is likely to die (hope it's Logan and not Rytlock/Cannach)
---
That's one of the big things I'm worried about with elite specs potentially being in the LS. How many do we get at a time? Is a class or two gonna have to wait a year or more to get theirs? Seems unfair.
---
I'm down for elite specs, I'd love it. But I think it'd be best if they're released all at once.
---
It's a leak alright. Not sure if it's from a gaming industry insider or someones anus.
---
It seems like they're talking about changing how Teq-style "bosses" work. Like they said, Teq/Claw/SB are all essentially statues that get told to play animations but can't move or do anything on their own. While creatures like an Awakened Abom/Vinetooth/etc. are creatures that move and rotate as needed. The big bosses would look like shit if they acted like creatures. Even the big creatures like Vineteeth/Aboms look weird when they rotate to track your movement. The instant 180 looks rough on something that big vs. a smaller creature.
---
What I get out of that is there is new tech coming that will make it easier to give prop bosses more fluid movement so they can act like creatures and animate more smoothly.
---
I want to hear her side of this whole ordeal.  Two sides to every story so I want the juicy details.
---
I heard that more as him being a tiny bit salty that the Abaddon fractal wasn't picked and not wanting to reopen that whole discussion.
---
Don't know if you're pretty. Maybe?
---
They could "easily repurpose" existing weapons. But there is no precedent for that. And it would be limiting, because an elite that _changes_ a weapon also locks that elite from using the standard weapon skills.
---
I would not want to give up elementalist staff or engineer rifle to get 'whatever this elite is bringing, unless it's a clear upgrade.  I'd rather get a land trident and speargun as it means I can still choose to use the other weapons.
---
Thing is, we kind of dealt with our threats. Kralk won't devour reality itself, all minor villains are slain, the other dragons are asleep and the deep sea dragon isn't part of the story. We *are* at a good point for a breather, aren't we?
---
hell yeah you're pretty, you sexy motherfucker
---
A very nice amount of content. As an avid player who loves all game modes.. Especially the large and detailed LS maps.
---
...But where exactly have the consistent balance patches been for PvP and WvW? 
---
Lets not just forget those guys.
---
And a beach chair to complete the theme.
---
An _ingame unlock_  
---
how quaint!
---
^(I'd love it actually)
---
I ain't got no eyes so I can't help you no more
---
I have 4,844 hours.  I have never seen a precursor that I haven't bought.  Welcome to the club.  On the other hand, I've seen about seven or eight Black Lion keys drop in the wild (for what little they are worth).  I also seem to have pretty good luck with various exotic dropping, in general; though, I have \~250% magic find.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cx0d6m/what_do_you_think_of_this_real_leak_or_just_yet/
---
GW1 had a shitton of useless skills. GW2 doesn't, all weapons are useful at least somewhere, so full reworks won't do much good and might actively harm diversity. There are enough useless utility skills, but changing utility skills will not create new playstyles.
---
GW2 is balanced enough that new skills have a much greater effect than in GW1, where skills were often useless and similar to each other already.
---
I don’t know if you realize this, but veteran &gt;hardcore&lt; players are a fart in space of the population, doubtful they bring in much revenue since they’re likely to have more time than money. No business would cater to that archetype.
---
Remember Wildstar? Pure hardcore mmo. It’s dead and gone.
---
An expansion will satist the vast majority of the playerbase, and veteran casuals who are jack of all trades.
---
But pls continue
---
Epic-rank bosses would be way more fun if they could move around more freely.
---
But if they were large creatures, they would look particularly bad when they turn around to face an enemy behind them. Normal size bosses already look bad enough when they instantly face back to attack something behind them.  People get used to this instant twitch and eventually stop thinking about it, but it still looks bad if you think about, and worse the larger the enemy is. This is more prominent on large enemies like the Megadestroyer, and way more on long enemies like the Champion Fluffy, vinetooths, or siege devourers. The instant turn makes them look kind of twitchy until you get used to that.  
---
But they developed 'turning time' for mounts, to make sure they can't turn around instantly. 
---
If they were able to extend mount turning time to players and NPCs, and that turning time could be adjusted so it can be almost as fast as it is now for players (so it doesn't affect combat negatively) and normal size enemies, but much smaller for larger enemies, fights against larger enemies would feel more natural, but more importantly, it'd be easier to fix the issue with immobilize not preventing enemies from turning around, by making it prevent turning while it lasts.  
---
A thief could finally pop immobilize on someone then move behind them with stealth to do a backstab without the enemy turning around as if they were not immobilized.
---
*laughs in mule characters*
---
There is no quests it's all hearts and random events. Story related stuff is marked on your map with a green star. Both norn  and sylvari are great norms feel slow to move and jump ppl though so jumping puzzles might feel weird on them.
---
I used to see the boxes for GW1 in a local shop, but at that time I didn't have interwebs so...
---
And then somehow a couple of months before release I came across a prerelease Dev blog about the sylvari, which led me to one about mesmers and I was just hooked on the whole idea. Bought it for my next birthday, never looked back :D
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion, but I regret to inform you that nobody cares about it.
---
ThIs PoSt Is So CrEdIbLe I wOnT eVeN aSk FoR sOuRcE
---
In other MMOs, your mounts just have one setting pretty much. It might be a different speed on land, underwater or in the area but they are pretty much just flat speed buffs. 
---
I'm not sure your point is all that valid though seeing as you've effectively changed a traversal build (which may still be used for particular places or JPs) that'd be pretty similar for others playing the same profession as you to mounts that reward situational awareness by having distinct advantages and disadvantages. You'd also pretty much traverse terrain the same way as other players previously whereas now you'll often have a choice for getting from A to B. Do you tackle the vertical obstacle with a springer or Skyscale? Do you move quickly over flat ground by finding a vantage point and using the griffon, opt for the roller beetle or prefer Jackal or raptor (that also have their own disadvantages and benefits). That also not taking into account variation with the order of mounts or using the abilities unlocked throughout LS4. 
---
Personally I find that much more engaging than being a Dash/shadowstep/SB Daredevil for getting around - the same as any DD caring about movement pretty much.
---
I like that you're trying to help out, but honestly you'd be better off wandering around [wayfarer foothills](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wayfarer_Foothills) for young herb nodes that drop peppercorn, while additionally farming [Halvaunt Waypoint](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Halvaunt_Snowfield)'s myriad of mobs that drop high-quality red meat for sous-vide.
---
I sold a Dreamthistle skin for 600g when the price was very high. I hoarded it from when I got it for 1 ticket.
---
Otherwise, I dropped a 185g dye from a dyepack I had gotten from the free key in the gemstore a few days ago.
---
I dropped 2 precursors, though both were underwater and not worth more than 15g and 40g respectively when I sold them.
---
Awww that's beautiful.
---
*only useable under water*
---
Hey there! We are certainly still going on this. In fact, one of us has just started looking into working on both races and professions. So really, this is perfect timing!
---
If you want to share anything, feel free to share via PM or drop some info in our [Github issues](https://github.com/lloyd094/Project-GW/issues) (we have specific areas for most things, and if there's anything left over, you could always put the rest in a brand new issue; you could also dump everything into one large issue).
---
Additionally, our [discord](https://discord.gg/xd2t4mb) is still active, so if you'd like to speak with anyone directly, that would be the easiest for those interactions! 
---
Thanks for posting here! I'm excited to see what you have!
---
no, though it has been requested for over 2 years, aka since the second we got the very first legendary trinket.
---
Occasionally I swear there's a 3rd on the left.
---
The most expensive items I've ever got were 13 bl key drops, but the items that came from using them were all crappy. 
---
Remember the ancient karka event that had a [chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Karka_Chest) at the end that gave 2 guaranteed exotics and 2 guaranteed rares?
---
It gave me ONE level 76 exotic and ONE level 78 rare. Both with the crappy default Iron skins, and the karka shells.  
---
Meanwhile there was people left and right  boasting about getting precursors.
---
There's rotten luck, and there's what I have. Anti-luck.
---
A few hours later and it appears to be a charr, how intresting
---
Oh I suppose so. Good point.
---
Cry me a fucking river will ya.
---
Wait till after the stream then buy them. Patience!
---
I hope he never shaves his beard again.
---
I want sailboats :(
---
so much bullshit in one piece of chatlog..
---
I had a chuckle when I saw wvw and pvp content over the years
---
As a veteran I don't think you can speak for me.
---
Elite specs are my top want.
---
Her testimony is evidence and I have no reason to doubt her. An investigation isn't going to uncover much other than each person's accounting of events. Like most of these cases, it will merely be he said/she said and so it comes down to who you believe. I have no reason to doubt her.
---
Yeah, I'm replacing my primer plot with Ascended herbs as soon as I have a multiple of 8 of the primer ingredients to craft the last ones without wasting ingredients. Primers are no longer BiS for garden plots when feasts offer so much more.
---
You need 250 truffles for a legendary weapon and mushroom pizzas were good food.
---
This isn't about the justice system, it's about my opinion and public opinion. I don't believe accused 100% of the time but I lean towards believing people who come forward
---
What about abortions?
---
OMG
---
Winter is coming boys
---
if this was a hint at new elite specs there wouldn't be a charr in the center. throughout core, HoT, and PoF, professions/specs have always been shown off in [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/92/Professions_reveal_12_%28highlighted%29.jpg) arrangement. same positions, same races, same genders... just updated specs.
---
yep, LS4 had already everything PoF had (actually more with fractals, raids) except elite specs.
---
so if they wanna give expansion-worthy content, it needs elite specs as absolute minimum to meet that criteria
---
That would actually be really awesome
---
I agree... i haven't login since last living world episode and haven't finish ep. 5,6 yet. 
---
It is so boring for casual player like me... who ... well ...have 20 characters with different elite each... what i want is variety of play styles that elite spec deliverble. for me ...the story is second important (well i can recap later in wiki page without playing episode anyway)  
---
In my opinion, The LS4 maps were bad... vast but empty and repetitive .... infinity grinding: new mounts which are optional, the same old meta event... i can't do the same meta event for a whole year for nothing.   
---
so i wish they could add elite to spice up the game a little bit.
---
There won't be legal case.
---
My speculation is based on her blog entry which mostly focuses on her perceived business injustice. I didn't say that those who speculate are declaring him guilty. 
---
Blog post is clear in its wording, Soul did not force himself physically on her. She chose to go to bed with him to keep career going. I don't understand people who act this way. And it drives my speculations in context of the rest of blog entry.
---
An allegation was made I have no reason to not believe.
---
And now we've got lightning in the background too.
---
my dad bought gw1 when i was like 11 or 12 and it stuck with me as THE game
---
but what changed tho. i'm a returning player and refuse to read this info unless it's handed to me on a silver platter /s
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape
---
Is gear progression better. I kinda hit a wall last time, given last time was pre heart of thorns. Also, is map completion still a necessity? I could never get past that.
---
One of my friends from elementary school moved away before we graduated, and we were really close, so our moms arranged for him to stay over at our house and go to the same camp for a week. He bought me GW as a thank you. Installed it using the 2 discs on our home computer, and there were no textures at all because the computer sucked. The ground was a neon gray, and my R/Mo was neon green. i played on and off throughout High school, then GW2 was announced and i also played that on and off. jsut got back into it after playing wow for a bit. this game is better
---
My only real Problem with Hot was that you needed a lot of players to remotely being able to make the events and that the maps were only made for those events.
---
Especially since after War Eternal's end, we can take care of some smaller stories without it feeling like we're ignoring a huge elephant in the room. There is a bit of peace for once, or at least less chaos than there has been.
---
That seemed pretty fake though. At least I hope it was. There was barely any new footage and the couple things I think were new were quick and could have easily been faked. Also, Why the hell would they say things like "Dungeon Finder", "Extended Experience", and then other generic changes.
---
**Good bait though, shame on you for trying to get people's hopes up.**
---
Friggen love this trailer, lol.
---
Adolescent male, case closed ;)
---
My next best guess would have been you running the class/build with the currently most simple rotation.
---
this expac better have a new class otherwise im not even interested in playing
---
I kind of feel bad for you, to be honest.
---
The Frost Legion, with Tribune Freezerburn and Imperator Coldheart. Side story update will include Centurion Coolheir.
---
Sooo, Charr/Norn expansion/season? I can dig it.
---
80% wishlist, 20% stuff that's already announced.

Missed an oppurtunity:  https://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+announcement+host

I'm not convinced it would actually be less work. I don't have any special insider knowledge, but I think players vastly underestimate how much work new artwork and animations are—didn't they once say it took 8–9 months of development to get a new armor set into the game?
---
Besides. If they're trying to convince us Living World is as good as expansions, we either need elite specializations or something as big and important as elite specializations. If we get new weapons, I expect them to come as a part of new elite specs. They can't be cutting corners if it's supposed to be expansion-like content.
---
According to the Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nigel) Nigel could mean Champion or a person who is unbelievably fantastic. SO there is something looking to us behind that snow...I SEE NIGEL

Updating this comment whenever i see something new o7

New track change, music went back randomly afterwards

Sign me up!
---
Holy shit, ascended weapons came out ages ago. I still remember it like it was yesterday.
---
Zero's because spoilers. :)
---
I mean it's not an expansion but a LW season.
---
And they said they added the revenants to even out the professions by armor class. So I don't think we'll ever get a new profession, just elite specializations.
---
Frost Legion... Me thinks. Maybe remnants of Flame Legion. Or the Blood Legion left in the homelands.
---
The mists got ruined, so the only places left to explore are space. Makes sense to me.
---
and what if their expectations are already at another LS4 style living story
---
i genuinely cannot fathom having this mindset
---
the story and open world are honestly the WORST part of this game by a longshot
---
Avengers
---
Yeah, I guessed as much when I wrote this and put in a ticket to hopefully resolve it.
---
I would love a minor graphical overhaul. GW2 still holds up very well despite its age but you’re right that the newer stuff definitely clashes with older stuff when they’re placed side-by-side.
---
You are definitely close as I remember missing POIs that were very close but the compass decided that a heart or waypoint were more important. Thankfully I use taco now but damn it sucked having to run across the map to get that one missing POI.
---
You will take many many many trips to Cymbel, and have to do that stupid escort many many times to be able to speak with her, it can't be skipped.
---
That's crazy, well done on it!
---
This would cause a massive lore retcon since we're still in a "if another Elder Dragon dies, Tyria goes boom" situation. Until we get a replacement for Zhaitan or Mordremoth we'll remain in that situation.
---
And something tells me the charr don't have a dragon scion lying around.
---
Plus, Jormag is one of the more interesting Elder Dragons. From release of GW2 he was isolated as being different from the rest as he focuses on getting willing converts over just corrupting and enslaving everyone. So if they kill any ED off screen I really hope it isn't Jormag.
---
So whats the the thirds name? We have Nigel, Timothy, and now?
---
Would be a pretty fun idea
---
That'd be so much of a copout.
---
Anet was like "Game of Thrones havent done justice to White Walkers and the entire Night King story arc so lets go"
---
5 charr now
---
Every character felt the same running around with perma swiftness or a 25% movement trait, except the ones who couldnt do it, and they just felt bad. And a tradeoff for decent movement in the open world just felt awful, I'm much happier being able to make builds without worrying about how I'm going to get around between fights. 
---
There was nothing "flavorful" about taking the one utility or trait that provided 100% swiftness uptime. It was just limiting. Now you have choice in how you get around, it's just not tied to your class.
---
It always blows my mind how anyone can just pop around a corner, become a prophet for 5 minutes and everyone loses their mind.
---
Here let me try: Season 5 soon covering the Far Shiverpeaks and the Depths, Expansion after that in 2020 will see the return of the human gods. Old dungeons get a challenge system, one new fractal en passant. Stronghold Rework, announcement of regular balance patches. Alliances this winter, Edge of the Mists will be changed to a battle royal map.
---
I agree. The fact that all the maps are time-locked just ruins any sense of immersion or living world. It feels like exploring very beautiful dioramas with some moving parts.
---
Being able to dye back items, at least ones that are paired with the dyeable gliders, is a little QoL thing I would adore. Please Aneeeet.
---
The easy answer for "I left . . what changed?", regardless of when, is:  
---
*Chrono nerfs*  
---
Kidding. Kinda. +1 to the work you put into that list, though.
---
Looks like there's 5 now.
---
All I see is potentially another class with two swords
---
That track was used in halloween.
---
Plans to do a graph of what changed in your graph in 2 years? :)
---
Dont choose based on starting zone, you can choose to go to any starting zone with any character from any race, you should choose for the race itself. 
---
Do you want very intertwinned and hive-like Sylvari, who are more peaceful than not but also a curious and young race trying to find its place in Tyria, or do you like Viking-barbarians with an awesome story about fighting a huge ice dragon with the help of animal spirits and heroes, then Norn would be the way. 
---
For their little bit of unique story, I think think Norn is a bit more fun, but Sylvari is very colourful and it lets you explore their culture. 
---
Youll end up playing. both im sure anyway so just pick the one you prefer for now and make your next character the other one. Gw2 is super alt-friendly and you will most likely want to use many classes.
---
that will show him!
---
yes so they're gonna add taimi and canach jokes instead
---
Taimi will stab Jormag
---
Do we even know who is supposed to be repairing it?
---
never
---
you mean poke?
---
Or you can pay a "sub" and get a "free" item from the gemstone. WOW, thats a nice VIP incentive!
---
How is 500 gems for 10$ with a 3 month sub 300 extra gems when i can get 800 gems for 10$
---
not if there are **inconvenience** for **other players**
---
Okay? Good for the streamers, I guess.
---
Watched my brother playing WoW Vanilla. At some point he got bored so i was looking into it myself but couldnt pay the subscription fee at that Time. I think i was 9 or 10 years old at that time. 
---
So i found GW1 which was buy2play and i felt in Love with it! And here i am 13 years later being excited for tomorrows Guild Wars Announcement.
---
Where are the gemstore updates? ^/s
---
And then there is WvW.  
---
I new map. Done.
---
How do we read this? Is it just the added things by year? Because if I left in 2012, the graph should be reversed?
---
I thought dynamic events were a launch thing :0 did they get revamped in 2019?
---
Imagine thinking you're ever gonna get a third expansion
---
So much stuff has changed since I last seriously played. (Caught the last like 4 major events of Living World Season 1). 
---
I always been meaning to get back into the game somewhat, but between work, other games. and other MMOs I just simply don't have the time anymore to add another MMO.
---
uncle beemish?
---
But season 4 was great
---
No it goes against Anet and their business model whether its optional or not. If at the start of GW2 they did this sure why not I'd have been annoyed but 7 years in and lets face it people leaving they say "oh by the way we are adding a sub model its optional" people will see the words sub model and will rightly say Anet have gone back on their business model. Its a bad idea.
---
Fixed, sorry. I meant 1000.
---
My relatives, who were avid fans of GW1 (played since the beginning) introduced it to my dad, who introduced it to me. Which is kinda funny, because I introduced my dad to WoW. Anyways, I played it, and it was an amazing experience. Leveling was awesome because it wasn't just a bunch of fetch quests, and the community was great and always willing to call stuff out (shout out to Orr karma trains and people who still remember them). Got deep into WvW and its politics, and had a great time overall. Makes me a bit nostalgic, kinda wish we could go back to the days where people were excited about GW2.
---
That’s literally Eye of the North with the titular characters switched.
---
Elaborate.
---
I'm 100% with you on this, even the [Olmakhan Sand Elemental tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/05/Olmakhan_Sand_Elemental.jpg) got way better textures
---
I hear swimsuits.
---
If I could skin over the accessories/rings I'd probably make them. I don't personally like the turd bubble you get with all three.
---
Umm, yes. But eventually we will run out of Dragons. The logo for this season so far would also apparently be not a dragon.
---
The music playing as the characters came into view was really spot on, imo.  Really looking forward to see where this ends up leading.
---
BC had too many one button rotations. Wrath at least let everyone do something somewhat engaging in combat.
---
There are 6 there
---
Whoa now I can it see both ways.
---
&gt;Standard protocol in ~~mmo~~ software development to have backups
---
FIFY
---
**Winter is coming**
---
An alliance of Norn and Charr that follow Jormag?
---
A friend of mine found info about Guild Wars 1 before it was released (when it was in it's monthly beta weekend phase).  I read the stuff and had a burning desire to play.  I got the game and played in the last beta weekend, had a blast, and stayed up late into the night on release (I was in college at the time and not being responsible).
---
I was disappointed when they said they were canceling more expansions for Guild Wars 1 but was interested in Guild Wars 2 hoping it would correct a few flaws (balance and skill bloat being two of the big ones).  I played in the betas for Guild Wars 2 and have taken a few breaks from the game but generally I've played a lot since release.
---
There is one issue with it. Gems do have absolutely stable cost and thus also gold has quite stable value. If you start selling gems cheaper (whatever how you package it), you can easily hit this.
---
Have you seen the wow classic numbers?
---
I would only pay a sub fee for GW2 at this point if they developed the content I want to play: Raids and WvW.  It's the sole reason I don't put any money in the gemstore because $0 of what I would put in goes to the content I enjoy.
---
Yes you can, but it won't be the pretty bloodstone oven. I did this yesterday on my main so I could have the home instance "bank access".
---
edited my post / wording and some points. :)  
---
hope that makes my standpoint a bit clearer.
---
The logo of living world has always been the same, just a different color. The game won't go on forever, but this is a story about the elder dragons. Only half of them are "dealt" with.
---
So far it's just a warning I guess
---
My hopes for a far shiverpeaks + blood legion homelands season intensifies!
---
The first time I heard of GW2 was when someone on the Smite sub compared a character to Necro (I think). Then I wanted to try a MMO but wasn't in the mood to pay $100 each year, which is when I remembered GW2. Turns out it had a free trial so I was like why the hell not. What really hooked me was the living world concept (surprise I know but I really am a fan of continuous story development) which made me buy HoT.
---
There's no morality contradiction. The game is still free, with a Pay to Play model. The VIP sub would be for those who want to support the game and at the same time have some minor perks associated. If I decide to buy $10k worth of gems today, it won't really affect your game experience. Besides maybe affecting the gold/gems exchange ratio, but the economy would most likely adjust right back again since the extra influx is not that great.
---
Frankly this is as pathetic as the innumerable people in Teapot's chat who, rather than focus on the game Teapot is actually playing, spend their time crapping all over GW2. 
---
Far too many people on both sides of this particular divide really need to grow up.
---
Looks like there's norn with horned helmets, a charr... and something shorter than a hunched charr, also with horns, but it doesn't seem to be a charr.
---
The head is too small and it isn't hunched enough. And it seems to have a beard, like a frozen dwarf.
---
How many seasons have actually dealt with the Dragons?
---
S1 - Scarlett
---
S2 - Modremoth
---
S3 - Balthazar with the Dragons, Mursaat and White Mantle as a side show.
---
S4 - Praise Joko. And then like a couple of episodes about a Dragon.
---
They’re typically, S4 aside build up for something else. S4 actually ended on a very open premise where they can go in any direction they want. Two Dragons are snoozing and one is active under the ocean but seemingly not well understood. Let’s get some Charr/Norn politics going on end on a cliffhanger with a Dragon. Or preferably not.
---
Yeah like Sabetha and Deimos, but it's usually just that, a single player baiting a mechanic for the group.
---
I'm talking about mechanic design on the scale of WoW mythic raids. Unfortunately I think GW2's combat system is still way too shallow and won't allow for that kind of variety.
---
What if this is just the flame legion who headed the calls of Jormag.  I never played GW1, but didnt the Charr want gods of their own to use in their attempts of invasion?  They used the titans Abaddon sent which gave them the cauldron used in the Great Searing.
---
Maybe this time they're trying to gain power through Jormag and that's why the logo is frost and flame.  It might not have anything to do with Primordus but with the new enemy of Flame Legion that serve Jormag now.
---
I would probably do that. Makes it much more sensible than sporadically spending for new skins.  
---
It would be like an allowance i guess...
---
Complete all PoI, Hero Challenges and vistas, and it will point to hearts.
---
 
---
Edit: and waypoints too.
---
&gt; One is clearly more likely than the other.
---
And we are undecided which one it is
---
&gt; Let's just assume for the sake of argument that this is true (which it is not, because not everyone has cooking max'd and many do not even plan to work toward this). So what?
---
You just need one Grandmaster Chef with the collection finished per guild who invites all guild members to their home instance to reap the ascended herbs and you also only need one (the same) to craft the feasts, so everybody is provided for 12 hours per day regardless of being master chefs or not.
---
&gt; Then this just lessens the "flood" that you are so alarmed by
---
That impact can be nearly disregarded, if the amount of accounts harvesting one and the same garden plot is big enough.
---
Taking a 50 man guild for example, they can harvest 588 ascended herbs with only 12 seeds or 600 herbs without using seeds at all.
---
So in the end, you either loose 12 herbs out of 600 (2%) or have to farm 12 varietal herbs for 12 seed pouches per day with 50 man.
---
Either way, that impact can be neglected.
---
Hopefully won't be as... short as the one in GoT.
---
Would be nice to have this for path of exile
---
Wait.......Are you saying I can swap saying 500 cooking skill from one character to another?  How?  And if you do so, will the oven appear in the other character's instance too?
---
Or do you mean the fee to just keep swapping in and out for the same character?
---
If you saw the anniversary stream yesterday the devs were worried about revealing season 5 stuff and Rubi did say "wait till tomorrow there will be rehearsals". So this is likely it. Lets just hope they don't accidentally stream the rehearsals.
---
What about adding secondary professions. Have it so you can wield first hand your primary class weap and off hand your secondary class weap. Make it so your trait line is one of the other class and you can access the corresponding utility skills.
---
I think mat stacks could be a little bit fishy. Specially if trade-able. I would rather it went for things beneficial for the player but of low impact to the economy. Untradeable stuff. etc. But yeah, you get my point.
---
POG, hype!!!
---
Is today low-effort field trip?
---
no it wasn't
---
You do realize that he said multiple times that he is neither done with GW2, not gone for long, right?
---
He has said multiple times he will do AT's if he gets a group together, do raid releases and the occasional GW2 stream. If you followed him for GW2, then I'd suggest refollowing, otherwise you may very well miss his GW2 streams.
---
but thats not an anology.
---
Eh, I don't think it's the combat system that's shallow. Ranged/melee split mechanics are not particularly interesting to me anyway, or playing DPS from range at all for that matter. Qadim 2 and VG also tried to incorporate range mechanics, but not to great success either.
---
Well it's been icy blue for 12 years in GW1 and I'm tired of that. Wish they would just let us cycle through all the previous login screens.
---
I have 2 plots, which should be 1 primer per day. Food would be only used during fractals run.
---
The last time I was so excited for a half covered screen was back in 1998 when my cinema lifted its curtains to start the screening of Pokemon: The Movie.
---
Economy would see a shift, yeah. But I don't think it would be drastic or at least not greater than when Daily rewards were implemented (where you get literally hundreds of gold just for login in).
---
Reminds me of the second legendary dagger draw animation.
---
So....can anyone point me to a current cheapest way of gaining 400 cooking skill?  I had thought all my characters would have access to the oven.  But if not...it means doing crafting.
---
Launch player here. I've never gotten a prec but I did get a Mordrem Saber from DS meta which I sold for about 280g and used the money to buy a Leaf of Kudzu which became my first legendary
---
I'd rather have them create more supply drops than having to set a subscription. 
---
I'll buy the supply drop if I want the stuff in it. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/New_Horizons_Supply_Drop_Requisition
---
Look at at that. over 5K worth of gems from less than 2,5K
---
I'd rather have the choice to get that when I like what's in it than a subscription. That may or may not give me what I want every time.
---
Thanks for sharing, I missed the other 10 posts before this one somehow!
---
Ranged gameplay is kind of awkward when it comes to PvE, since boons are almost always shared via AoE, so if you're out of range or not in the AoE, you're not gonna get it. That being said, Deadeye (the highest ranged class) can easily give itself all the damage-focused boons it needs, allowing it to stay at range during PvE boss fights.
---
In PvP, ranged damage is always an advantage, especially if it isn't projectile-based.
---
It's the living world Logo with living world write
---
And there is going to be a dragon's head in the upper middle. Didn't we already have something like this picture leaked?
---
oh, i should have said that i meant the mat storage with that, let me edit that quickly.
---
What do you mean missing?  It's being posted every 5 minutes..
---
You go to sleep with the knowledge you're a loser, and you wake up with the knowledge that you're pathetic. 
---
I'm surprised you haven't killed yourself yet, to be honest.
---
I am scared at the prospect of this happening. When GW2 was announced it happened at the same time as the announcement of the final expansion to GW1 - Eye of the North... I hope they're not going for "Season 5 is last season then GW3" announcement.
---
There is no movement. The passing snowflakes make it look like the cloth to the left is moving.
---
Ay no problem man

Nope. But many guess it is Eir's good friend Biegarth.

Bah. Shall I tell who won the fight between Tony Stark and the Mandarin in Iron Man 3??  Almost 3 year old content is beyond the scope of 'spoiler alert' :)

So just so we're clear: 
---
People leaving to a game they enjoy more, even if it's temporary, that is absolutely disgusting and good ridance to those assholes, but [you complaining about the pricepoint of PoF](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6r3cj0/hot_50_eur_vs_pof_30_eur/) and [shitting on Anet over the past couple months for the most mundane shit imaginable](https://imgur.com/a/fTNmXTE), that's fine...
---
Grow up, kiddo
---
They're too fire focused to go to Jormag imo. Plus in GW1 after the death of titans they tried to make the destroyers new god figures to worship. Didn't work out. After this they "learned their lesson" and stuck with not finding gods, but making. Hence Gaheron Baelfire who attempted to obtain a form of godhood and immortality (via resurrection) in the form of the Eternal Flame.
---
Perhaps Jormag rises from his slumber again and envelops the Charr Homelands in icy death, leading to legions of charr becoming Icebrood.
---
I still only see 4... Yet I've seen comments saying there are 8 (3 to right, 4 to left).
---
It's been there since forever. Just a cloud.
---
I still vividly recall on WoTLK launch day, having to walk up to the desk sergeant in Stormwind Harbor to report in, and take the ship to Northrend, and he said something about getting in line with the other recruits.
---
And I'm like "Don't you know who I am??", especially with the Hand of A'dal title floating over my head.
---
This is why I don't mind being the Commander in GW2, because I like that the game recognizes that I'm not just a typical bookah running around the fountain.
---
I never left, but cheers on this epic chart.
---
So mesmer
---
i thought it slightly a shame that the endless ocean wep set didn't have any spear or tridents, :I
---
I mean, I think that's going to be inevitable to some extent for the next few days at least. Say it's season 5, but with xpac features: people want it to be an xpac. Say it's season 5 but with the promise of a new xpac in a year, people want it sooner. Say it's an xpac now, and it looks amazing for PvE stuff, we still haven't got a magic bullet to make WvW perfect or PvP have swiss style tournaments yesterday, and people will still want more raids and dungeons faster, and rewards are always garbage to half of people no matter what they do. 
---
I just hope that they can make a decent chunk of us happy, even though unfortunately I know they can't make all of us happy.
---
Agreed all around, thanks for putting in to writing what I missed in my explanation.
---
its probably just a small animation on loop for a certain time until they reveal more and it repeats the loop again?
---
Been what, 5 years since AC timeline?
---
Demigod*
---
But Jormag is in a weakened state, very similar to the state Kralkatorrik is in during Dragonfall's end meta.
---
Don't forget though that Jormag was awake for 150 years longer than Kralkatorrik, so he would have absorbed more magic before Zhaitan died. And while it wasn't much he *did* get magic from Zhaitan and Mordremoth too. It was also implied in the Narrative Q&amp;A earlier this month that more dragons than Kralkatorrik and Aurene got some of Balthazar's magic.
---
Besides all that though, unless Aurene plays a direct role (which imo she shouldn't) then Jormag is still a powerful foe just by virtue of being an Elder Dragon.
---
That all said, Tom Abernathy did say that doing constant world ending threat plots is boring and he heavily implied S5 won't be such but may lead into one. So I'm betting the plot will be more about Jormag's faithful trying to help him heal and rise again.
---
Id say only places where i wouldnt like to see longbow ranger is in t3 to t4 fractals and raids. Everywhere else, i think theyd be ok. Dungeons became so easy, having 1 subpar dps shouldnt be an issue. Theyre actually pretty popular in wvw roaming with longbow/gs soulbeast.
---
Okay a couple of things after reading the first few lines. These are police reports and reports to campus authorities, and they’re also estimates and it very clearly states the true amount is unknown.  
---
My hunch is that the amount of accusations done through things like blogs or interviews that aren’t reported to police are much more likely to be false.  
---
And that’s exactly what this is.
---
Complete shit. Gorse infusion drops from time to time, I would estimate it to be around 2% from my years of killing him every week, but with 2000 crystals stuff - don't even bother. Just buy it with currencies or buy it from people who bought it with currencies.
---
6.

GW2 OST still the best music in the game all these years later. Jeremy Soule is a horrible person it seems, but the music just had a much more classical epic feel to it that just suits Tyria perfectly. It uses strings, winds and brass all perfectly and the when the heavy drums kick in it amps everything up just right.
---
The new music is good though, not saying I don't like it, it's just not quite the same.
---
Title of your sex tape.
---
I bought HoT and PoF at the same time and HoT is the expansion that finished GW2 off for me.  Man alive I despised that zone and every single time I had to go in it my ahole puckered with dread.
---
Be honest guys, the way they are teasing the launch of this announcement on their stream is actually pretty cool.
---
Battle Royale and wvw are nothing alike. Nothing.
---
Cool! Thanks for the heads up!
---
Looks like a ice lizard.
---
when you are a gw2 player and like the game, the atmosphere on his channel is not good or fun for ppl like him atm. why should he still follow?
---
After actually looking and reading over this...still doesn't change my stand on where the game is now. I don't raid because all of my raiding experiences have been garbage, fractals get repetitive, the story and content cadence is lackluster at best. I've got all the ascended and legendary gear i want, I've gotten each of the mounts and masteries tied to them; and anything else i could possibly want is behind either the RNG of the Black Lion chests (loot box fad) or the gem store. 
---
This chart shows that the devs have been busy keeping the game float and adding on features and changing things to try and keep the game fun and engaging for players, but all of that content on this chart, yielding repeatable content (Raids, Fractals, WvW, PvP, etc) there's not a lot here...and that's where i'm at with the game. I played since launch, I saw all of this content go live, and I'm sure i'll be back for LWS5 but...they're really gonna have to pull out all the stops if they want to keep people engaged.
---
I can't remember much but I did like the gliders. We'll see how I feel about it once I go back and complete HoT content. Can I ask why you hated it?
---
I can't think of a major mmo that has raids that scale down to 5 players.
---
Been getting the same thing a lot on mounts with my Asura lately too, I do not remember it being a problem before but maybe one of those cannot unsee type things *shrug*
---
Depending on your ressources and what legendary you make, you can absolutely make a profit. For instance, i crafted Dreamer and Moot for around 1k each (and that was with buying almost everything on the TP, including precursors) and sold them for around 1600 each. If you farm every ressource yourself, the profit margin would be much higher, of course.
---
Could be icebrood norn snow leopard form like Svanir was an icebrood in norn bear form.
---
imagine following a game on twitch and not the streamers who play it.
---
I think I found Guild Wars the same way I found most games back in the day; in a box in the computer games section at a store. My Dad and I would pick up most of the RPGs to play and while we preferred offline games, we originally gave GW1 a try. I had fun messing around with it, but didn't care for GW1 too much and preferred other games but my dad stuck with it. Then years later, he was on the GW2 hype train while I was between games and I ended up trying it on his account during the first beta and I really liked GW2. Ended up getting it on my account and playing every beta and stress test up to release.
---
They also look like cape edges too me. Could see it being either way.
---
Shiverpeak charr hunted to extinction for their fur...
---
They've been putting capes in concept art since forever though.
---
It's en vogue so guess it's time to lose the classical epic vibe the game always had.
---
It's a Dwarf, oh mama!
---
Is it? haha.
---
Are they gonna fix the engine so my PC can actually hold a 70 man karma train with snow?
---
yeah, thats not how all ppl think. I think like you, but OP certainly doesnt. and I know a lot of ppl that are like him. they just want the game they like in their follower list or dont like big lists.
---
and tpot said he will stream the new stuff when it comes out and then he will probably leave again. so when a new release is around the corner OP can just tune again. not a big problem.
---
I need Rubi laughing as the last panel
---
Which proves what?
---
And no I haven’t have you? Or do you mean twitch?
---
What if it really is about Jormag's influence spreading into the Blood homelands?
---
Jormag's shtick -that we know- is seducing those that will listen with promises of power. All it takes is anyone in there saying yes
---
It could, but the precedent for this one is there. It can always go another way, but the Jormag/Primordus one would be my preference. 
---
LS5 could be a setup for it, with a slow exploration of how Jormag corruption works, meeting with the last dwarves and discovering some artifacts we can use/infuse against the dragons while helping with destroyers. Meeting with Kodan, other northern races, defending them from being corrupted, etc. So only looming threats in the background. Then the expansion is our actual fire and ice campaign.
---
Or for a more exciting season, a slow buildup to Jormag where the plan is to lure Primordus and Jormag together and make them kill each other. The entire season is Jormag focused, but the final confrontation fails. Jormag is killed by Primordus and he escapes, so the expansion is trying to fight a super buffed up Primordus without having a lot of access to his weakness.
---
Charr-lifaunt!
---
I solo mostly as pugging never works out and my schedule prevents me from forming any bonds with guildmates but from the sulfur pits north, in PoF, you can easily solo that and the areas are beautiful but for HoT bring as many with you as you can unless you're a masochist.
---
Isn't that exactly what people did in guild wars 1 to get mats on the market?

Icy Nigel sounds like an urbandictionary sex term.

Your entire post history is nothing but hate and bullshit.
---
I avoid it as much as possible but ANet made them mandatory in PoF.
---
woot woot icebrood! I was really  hoping we'd fight another elder dragon that converts everyone into slaves for its army. Now all we need is some asuran technology to fix this problem.
---
He meant bots by devs so you always can play.

Compression artifacts.

---
Yeaaah, because unending negativity, curses and threats are the only way to make things better!
---
It's fine, keep at it, I'm sure it making you very happy.
---
For very specific jumps and portals, sure, but you don't need them to traverse most of the land in pof.
---
That was beautiful.
---
I miss that smile
---
I would like to pay a sub for GW2, but I'm not interested on gambling BS or stupid RNG chances.
---
So, only gems is not good enough for me; that sub would have to give me direct access to all that stuff currently locked behind BLC, mount licences, etc. (maybe an special store with adjusted costs for those items). Also, improved drop rate for those items that nobody ever get (e.g. queen bee thingy), maybe making them account bound or whatever for it to not mess with the market.
---
Any hypothetical sub that doesn't somehow address these two flaws would not interest me.
---
&gt; So when people choose the Dragonhunter, they choose the utilities (traps) mostly? 
---
No, I think that they were just showcasing the traps for you in that video. In the meta fractal build [here](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter), you can see that they use two traps (procession of blades and dragon's maw), and the rest are core guardian skills.
---
&gt; . Come on, I hate stupid melee weapons, why this game forces you to play melee only?
---
I mean, it does and it doesn't. The big thing about melee is that, in group instances, shared buffs and healing are done at a limited range, so it helps when everyone is in one general area
---
But if you want to go ranged, there are other options. Guardian uses a scepter for mid range dps, ranger can use a shortbow or a throwing axe for mid range dps, it's just that parking out at a long distance is a safe option, so it generally is also a weaker option.
---
&gt; If I will play guardian with a longbow and full dragonhunter abilities and utilites - will I be considered 'not good enough' for other players or what? 
---
Some people yes, some people no. There are crowds of people who think that your two options are meta or shit. There are also crowds of people who think that, as long as you're not being total garbage, they're fine with going a little slower. You just have to find the right groups to play with
---
&gt; Btw, people say Druid can't stand the solo content because he lacks damage, it's a pure healer
---
Only if you choose to build it that way. Your damage output is largely dependent on weapon choice, skills equipped, traits equipped, and gear equipped. If you're wearing full healer gear, then yes, you're going to have a bad time doing solo content. You won't die, but neither will the enemy. If you're wearing dps gear, you'll generally be fine doing solo stuff. 
---
&gt; So why that guy said that it's worse playing a Ranger with a longbow if it's only for solo content, like if I will be struggle to kill trash mobs with a longbow or what? 
---
Longbow just tends to be a lower dps weapon, again, because it's so safe. The trap that people fall into is what we call "bearbow", which is that you let your bear pet tank for you while you stand in the back with a longbow, It's safe, and you'll kill what you need to in open world at least and doing solo content, but it's not what anyone would really call good.
---
For all we know they both gas their neighbor's pets every month. There's no point in conjecture of this nature.
---
Acting as though OP is at fault when we have no reason to assume so is even worse than acting like she is at fault when we at least have a perspective on that.
---
Not to mention, maybe he does play every weekend? Maybe he doesn't like going to the fucking club. Maybe they weren't meant for each other, and he responded the way he should have to someone flipping out and giving him an ultimatum.
---
What is the cost of one feast? Isn't it 5g?

I got a dhuum chair in like the third week but no one else I know have ever gotten a chair.  That is a good 30+ people weekly clearing on main and alts.  I think I have got a total of 5-6 ghostly infusions full clearing every week since SV came out with main and a lot of alts as well.  If you want one of these items, buy them.
---
I got one Ghostly Drop. When I used to raid frequently we'd see one every month or maybe 2? But by the time you get a drop you'll have all the currency you need to buy one already.
---
Why would you grow anything besides the ascended seeds....?
---
Played Guild Wars 1, because I was too poor for WoW, and turned out to like it better than WoW anyway.
---
Calling it: the Blood Legion from the Charr Homelands are planning a significant assault against Jormag, and we have to prevent their success. Not 'dragon threatening the world' scenario, but still dangerous enough that we have to risk an all-out war.
---
what if I enjoy being efficient?, both concepts aren't mutually exclusive.
---
no just pets that tag a long
---
Well I was shorthanding it since people don't like walls o' text but yeah we don't yet know the full scope of requirements for ascending to Elder Dragonhood. We just know that "lesser dragons" like wyverns, hydras, and skyscales cannot become Elder Dragons.
---
As for a charr becoming a replacement this seems impossible. Mortals cannot handle even a fraction of the amount Elder Dragons house, they become crazed by the magic (e.g., PoF/S4 bounties). And even Balthazar couldn't be a proper replacement, otherwise we had no reason to antagonize him let alone stop him from absorbing an Elder Dragon's magic.
---
So while we don't know all requirements it seems to require a "high dragon" for lack of a better term. Or a creature connected to The All like dragon minions.
---
As for working with Jormag. Of all Elder Dragons, Jormag seems most likely to be able to become good (followed by Zhaitan but he's a deader). Not sure I'd like a random group of charr suddenly enslaving an Elder Dragon though. I feel like if any group could manage that, it's the Inquest under Overseer Kuda who has been continuing Kudu's works. It'd be nice to see them as the main antagonists and not just a randomly plunked group of villains for a map.
---
Would actually enjoy if Kuda repaired and completed Kudu's Iron Forgeman 2.0 and used it to battle and dominate Primordus, turning Primordus into some enslaved cyborg (the cybernetics being the controlling mechanisms) and becoming a legit threat.
---
Hrm. That might be more likely than my guess: the Blood Legion from the Charr Homelands are planning a significant assault against Jormag, and we have to prevent their success. Not 'dragon threatening the world' scenario, but still dangerous enough that we have to risk an all-out war.
---
How do i get (minis)
---
Absolutely so much fun.  I love it when games do this sort of thing.
---
Yeah it's really strange and doesn't quite fit in right now with what we see currently
---
I quit before the original Lions Arch was axed and came back close to the end of HoT.  I absolutely loved it.  The difficulty from the mobs was enjoyable to me and making it to the lost city in AB was magical to me once I heard that music.  That plus the LS3 stories, which most people hate, I honestly found fun.  Before I knew it I had most of Auroras stuff finished before I even knew what Aurora was.
---
Wait... Did the video image change over time?
---
It's not necessary at all. This guy is severely overreacting. Just a tiny bit of practice and you're good.
---
You‘re probably thinking of minipets
---
You mean the expansion coming after season 4 like they said hmm wait oh yeah they didn't say that.
---
I think he does for some of the books, but it's not finished. Besides, I think I'll go with recaps now (else I would have just buy the book). But I already spend so much time with Guild Wars 1 lore before I even started playing Guild Wars2, I probably need to recap first and try if I enjoy gW2. if I will, I can return to the books later :-)
---
Srly.... if I think about it, my "joke" from the thread before gets.... a little less stupid?  
---
Jormag is dead or enslaved, by the Homelandcharr, who now invade Tyria, with the Power they gained there. The Frost Legion (or whatever) thinks of every other race as inferior and want to wipe them out. Thas also why they invade ascalong: the ascalonian charr work toether with "weak" races, so they're weak too.  
---
Or im just messing around. But since there is [this tweet](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1166763542835544069) of Mr Cheeky Hints himself and the picture we see now.... let me mess around! =D
---
Minis are unlockable from achievements, you can buy them on trading post, some do drop from certain bosses, and such.
---
now hold up, VB and AB are both mostly fine solo.  if you know your class.  I have no issues with probably 80% of both maps on my DH or DD, SB is a little more dicey but that's because i'm still not used to their mechanics

Here you go. I run a FB with zerker stats and flame legion runes.

I despise snow and don't care for norn/charr lore, and even I think this slow reveal countdown is pretty awesome.

So, this is really read as "what got added x year" and not "what I missed by leaving x year"

Have you tried including the d3d9.dll.md5sum file from ArcDPS as well?

I had the same issue after updating arc and after i put that file in it worked like a charm again.

It's not impossible and it wouldn't be the same style of Monk from Prophecies as those are more religious in conotation despite their martial arts dance. This monk is more of a martial type. The kind you find in monestaries training all day long during a musical montage of asian styled music and then the student confronts the master and tries to take a pebble from their hand. Only if they can take the pebble will they be ready.
---
pets that just tag along, anyone can have. If you want them to fight back and help you in combat, that is Ranger only.

I think we might get something like Season 2, where they grow maps over time and also do some stuff on core maps.
---
&gt;If they announce a new expansion with new specs and new maps and essentially that's it, more or less the same as PoF, will people be satisfied?
---
I probably would be. What brings me back is the new elite specs :P
---
This is probably the most irrelevant thing you could ask regarding season 5.
---
You are missing "Complete engine overhaul".
---
What about fishing 500?
---
This is something I struggle with too. For me it took just randomly joining a guild, I went through a lot of guilds but then I found the one where it all clicked. I considered them to be better friends then I've had even outside the game.
---
I've also met some friends just playing through the game. Like I'll compliment someone's toon and we will just start talking and hit it off with each other.
---
friday will either be memes or dreams
---
 &gt; And we are undecided which one it is
---
No, "we" are not.  
---
Stop discounting the intelligence of the devs.  Of course they know how nodes work.  Of course they know your 50 man guild scenario is a possibility.  They also know this could happen with 100 man guilds (gasp).  Even 100 100-man guilds.  If this is how people want to spend their time in game, there is nothing wrong with that.
---
I want to win a line at least. That one is a no no for sure. :(
---
&gt; if another Elder Dragon dies, Tyria goes boom
---
Unless the charr built a new bloodstone or something to capture the magic.
---
~2g per additional character to get the oven. Not that bad if you just want it on 2 or 3. Pricey if you want it on 70something characters.
---
i grew up when nigel was that weird loner guy who had no friends
---
It would still be more profitable, simply because buying on the TP is always more expensive than farming the stuff yourself. If nothing else, you will pay fees and that adds up quickly.
---
I left as soon as the real money black lion trader was opened. How are new skills earned now? Do you buy them from books or rewards for fighting certain monsters, or a different system?
---
I don't see beta on the chart.....
---
What if the red part of the season 5 logo isnt promordus, but the blood legion? We could maybe explore both the north and north east part of tyria, for both jormag stff and blood legion homeland stuff!
---
They stopped doing expacs for the original gw games and test there is still a small diehard group of people who will play until they die. I disagree with your reasoning.
---
:shrugs:  you can't just faceroll content like you could in core tyria.  you need to be a bit more tactical about stuff, and either burst weaker shit down quick enough to not have them matter (see: pocket raptors) or be quick on dodges/blocks/aegis applications to outlast the chunkier enemies.  Mordrem Snipers are evil incarnate.
---
your implication was that the HoT maps can't be touched solo, when that's just not the case at all.  you just need to adjust your expectations because its vastly more difficult than core tyria and needs to be approached differently.  
---
I'll certainly grant that TD is terrible and requires far more skill to solo than probably anything else in the game, from an open world perspective.
---
Lol cause it was hard or something? What's wrong with HoT or Southern PoF maps? I feel like all maps were super well done. Great depth and lots of hidden bits of lore and content. Only maps I have issues with are the unfinished ones like DoK, DoI and DS.
---
They may get extra fancy and even call it *Living World* Season 5
---
Really? To this day Hot is still my favoruite content, lws3 included, it was amazing, tons of exploration, hard enemies, beautiful maps
---
They stopped because they were working on GW2 I'm sure if GW2 wasn't thought of we would have gotten more campaigns like Utopia or expansions.
---
I don't think we'll see a new Bloodstone. HoT added lore saying the Forgotten couldn't make one because they lacked "divine resources". And with how distrusting charr are of magic and gods it just seems higjly unlikely.
---
&gt; I mean, we kind of do have reason to assume he's at least somewhat at fault based on what OP himself did say.
---
We really don't. Not any more than we do her.
---
&gt; If you care even the smallest amount about your relationship you do not straight up ignore your partner when they're upset, 
---
Relationships are complicated. This sounds like a situation where they'd often argued and it was time for it to end. There's nothing romantic about toughing out a relationship when you aren't a good match for each other.
---
&gt; especially (if we do reasonable assuming) she is at his place specifically to spend time with him.
---
Obviously she is. Do we know how she ended up there? Did she just show up on her way to the club? Does she just hang out there more often than not? Every relationship is different, and it's not right for you to apply your relationship standards to theirs.
---
I have a friend, for example, whose girlfriend essentially lives at his place. Not really, she has a place. But she stays with him more often than not, it's just assumed she's going to leave work and head there and stay the night unless otherwise stated. If they were in this situation then it wouldn't be "ignoring your girlfriend when she comes over to hang out." At that point she is staying nearly full-time at his place so she's there regardless.
---
&gt; I would be absolutely furious if my husband did that to me.
---
This isn't your husband and it isn't you, and their relationship isn't yours.
---
&gt; I have broken up with someone for almost this exact scenario though so maybe I'm a little more sensitive to the girl's side.
---
I think that must be the case, because you're definitely giving her the benefit of the doubt over him. And did you enter his house after the break up and mess with his stuff/delete things from his online accounts in revenge? 
---
If the answer to that last question is no then you might need to examine it a bit more objectively and consider that someone who would pull a stunt like that is no more worth the benefit of the doubt than OP is.
---
Time for Rytlock to defect back to his legion?
---
You forgot WvW alliances but that might be coming anyway? RIGHT?!?!?!
---
Hey the two worst game modes in GW2
---
It's been a few hours, we're down for another one.
---
The odd thing is I (after a LOT of asking repeatedly) asked if Seimur and the cooking station in your home instance was an account unlock or only for that one character and was told it was indeed unlocked for your whole account.  I'm hoping it's a bug and we'll basically get bank access in our home instance for this.
---
Fishing anywhere in Tyria, but we still use high powered harpoon cannons to do it

"Arthas, my son..."  Oops, wrong MMO.
---
I played the original Guild Wars back in 2005. Back then there were almost no quality f2p MMOs out. I had just come off Everquest Online Adventures when they decided to increase their subscription rate from $10/month to $13/month (this was absolutely outrageous at the time as I was in high school and had limited funds as it was which I had to earn. I was considering WoW at the time, but a group of my friends told me about this new game called Guild Wars which didn't have a subscription, didn't have a massive penalty for dying (in EQ you had an exp debt you had to pay off before you could continue leveling) and it wasn't going to take years to reach max level. Plus I was going in with a group of like 8 friends. I instantly loved the game and played it like a madman. My other friends slowly dropped out but I stuck with it and captured a bit of my own personal glory throughout the years. I also voraciously devoured the lore of Tyria and thought it all was very facinating. Over the years, I did slow down my play and even enjoyed other MMOs such as WoW, Tera, and Eve. But when I heard they were making a sequel to GW and that it was going to be more of a solo hero type game, as opposed to the mandatory team play from GW1, I was instantly enthralled and purchased the game as soon as I was able. My biggest problem with GW2 is the inability to connect with the community the way I did in GW1 and other MMOs. There's no real random encounter with another player that encourages you to meet and befriend each other. You meet at an event objective along with other people, work to complete the event, then go your seperate ways. You don't stop to get to know other people. This is why I've been working to bring my RL friends into Tyria so that I have a group of people I can rely on.
---
&gt; I was waiting for someone with a HUGE epeen to come in and tell me I don't know my class.
---
Oh don't be that guy. GW2 is like the only mmo on the market currently with a difficulty curve. I'm sorry you weren't up to it.

My vague plan is to designate a post (either we will make one or some nice soul will) where it's a a catchall arrgghhhhommggggthis!omg this!!! Arrrrrh this! Kind of thread prior to the announcement. This will be stickied. 
---
Then when some kind soul makes a summary / structured work in progress thread move the discussion there. 
---
Things like anet blog posts can get their own link post. But posts where people just squeel over one small part will probably be trimmed down. 
---
All subject to change based on mod availability (some have already said they're MIA) and general feeling of the sub.  We want everyone to have fun and be excited about what they're going to announce, but we also want the place to be readable.  As always any posts removed for being low effort / low value is not personal, we want the sub to readable and enjoyable by all. If anyone sees something they think shouldnt exist, shoot us a mod mail or make a report and we will get to it asap :)
---
Apologies if the joke flew over my head, but map completion has never been a necessity.
---
No new JPs were added because as fun and awesome as a difficult puzzle is, most people do it once and never again. Chalice of Tears is absolutely incredible, but it's so time-consuming and soul-crushing for so little reward that no one does it. So why would they bother adding more JPs when most people won't do it? It would be a waste of developer time, unfortunately. Same reason they stopped working on Super Adventure Box. It sucks, because I love JPs.
---
Really, if they added better rewards for JPs, I feel like more people would do them. Back when the game came out, I always did Obsidian Sanctum every day because it was fun and challenging, but also because it dropped siege at a time when siege cost significant money. Getting an Alpha Golem once or twice a week was insane. 1g for about 7-15 minutes of work (depending on enemy presence in the puzzle)? Totally worth it.
---
So scale the reward based on difficulty and average time to completion, so something like Abaddon's Ascent or Chalice of Tears give 1g-2g daily, while something like Vizier's Tower or Antre of Adjournment would give maybe 50s.
---
Flame Legion, with their Leader-God dead, have turned into Jormag for power. Icebrood + Flame Legion = Love.
---
Those are called [Miniatures](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Miniature) or Minis for short in GW2.
---
Pets refers to the ranger's profession mechanic. 
---
There's some cheap minis you can buy in the trading post, many you can earn playing, and they also come from the gemstore, mini claim tickets and BL statuettes.

The material cost associated with the HI is in the acquisition of the nodes, and those are substantial.  The costs are all paid upfront and players spend the rest of their GW2 "career" trying to recoup those costs.   And there is nothing wrong with attempting to profit from a HI. 
---
Thanks for the elaborate, far fetch scenario about the guild who does nothing but harvests a home all day and does not adversely affect the game at all, but needs a bug report because the devs don't not how the garden plot nodes work.   The time spent with you was...time spent.
---
Not unplayable, just dead.

Also it's not WvWvW anymore, just WvW.
---
There's been some confusion about an upcoming promotion for the Living World (DLC) bundles, so keep an eye on them if you're interested - will likely go on sale soon.
---
Looks amazing!
---
Coming from the tech world, the concept of large expansions boggle my mind. In an age where the larger tech community pushes for smaller more frequent updates that are much more stable and easier to troubleshoot (less new code means fewer places to have to look to find bugs). Larger changes by nature are riskier and legacy software/business and gaming are the only to places where large changes are still a big thing.
---
I think living world makes more sense from a stability and content push standpoint. An expansion won't necessarily give players more content, but rather more content at once rather than the same content spread out over months.
---
Oh I shouldve learned from you beforehand 8D
---
FWIW, the game's Wiki has a good page for both [Releases](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release) and [Release Features](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release/Features).

RIP guru :(.
---
I wish in the future we can have charr with closed mouths in more than one face
---
Thanks :D Yeah, this particular charr had his mouth agape the entire time, so I closed them for the artwork, haha.
---
Well, the fact is that we realy don't care
---
I would tend to agree for typical game play, this topic included ... until it bleeds over into the realm of: new player + gem store.
---
Is it actually worth it to buy silver fed scrap-o-matic? I read all the Google docs showing profit margins, etc. but even if the guides mentioned the uncommon scrap kits, they would leave out the mystic forge recipe or I had no idea what those stones were used for, how to use them, where the mystic forge was and that such non saved recipes existed. Cut to me holding out until a sale then make an uninformed purchase that I only realized was uninformed six months in, I would have never spent money on the gems for it given that anet would have made clear: oh hey, you CAN make 250 kits as opposed to this. Even the YouTube videos which covered what to buy or not were all over the board on pretty much everything besides copper fed and mistlock pass.
---
Not implying you hold this opinion but ... One can say to the above: Your fault buddy. This type of opinion typically comes from people who essentially think they chose their parents and environment but don't have the mental capacity to actually grasp their error in judgement of another's action in that said action is being made subjectively, yet I cannot judge them for behaving as such for the exact same root cause reason: lack of freewill.
---
I suggest this scarcity of comprehensive information or where to find it in your first six months of playing a game six years in existence benefits the gem store profits in a less than fully transparent way. Luckily I have the financial means that I can't cry too much about it and make and honest argument for myself but it is more that I care about the people who cannot afford the gems and still make the purchase. That's a bad anet! Bad dog!

It won't, goodbye 👋

I agree but the problem is that you dont need to acquire any nodes to harvest them for free.
---
If we would apply the same scenario to ascended mats of other professions, it would be as if a grandmaster armorsmith gets a deldrimor forge in their home instance, which has to be stocked with the materials to forge 1 deldrimor ingot. Next day, the ingot is ready and everybody he invites to his home instance, can take one deldrimor ingot out of it as long as the instance owner doesnt take out as well. Without ever having leveled any profession up to level 500 or contributing the required mats for the ingot.
---
I've been playing since beta and like that guy in spaceballs combing the desert with a comb I ain't found $\*\*\*
---
I don't include ascended weapon/armor boxes since you can't sell them.
---
I think maybe I sold something for 30 gold once, it was some ugly bow in the HOT expansion that was gigantic.  Since I've been playing so long I consider that complete garbage.  My MF is 1 away from Max and my drops have gone from complete garbage to garbage.
---
Plenty of vendors you can access that sell temporary pets or tools that can help fight as well too

Whether you do it or not, a lot of end game is based on grinding.

Well, these are just icebrood charr, so everything is true, except for  Jormag being the bottom.

Running my standard HoT Train when it finally dawned on me that the conversation was being directed towards a developer.
---
I've seen Jonadev around a few times but never had him join one of my squads. Was pretty cool how laid back and chill he was, talking with folks.
---
Na that's a char
---
I really liked it up where you get the hopping rabbit (forgot its name).  I am a desert highlands type so loved that part of the map.
---
If they do this it needs to have an excited Mammoth-Jester dance.
---
You have to complete the quest steps per each character to get the upgraded looking one, that is the whole point. Some don't care about the upgraded looking station but I do, on my main.
---
Meh.  Nice chatting with you.
---
👍
---
Well hopefully you called nobody neckbeard or something. And no, the game won't cure cancer with the start of S5, no matter what.

I mean the ascalonian 15k armor from Gw1 used charr fur squares and was made of charr fur. Soooo
---
"better be good", but provides no expectations or what you deem "good". What are you trying to accomplish with this post? It's okay to just keep this in your head, nothing of value of being shared. You're just "threatening" to quit the game.

Guild Wars 2: Warlords of the Lich King
---
why, it's not a troll just having some fun friend :)
---
Thank you! The two requests were quite different from eachother - there's so many amazing looking characters in this game.
---
Yeah, it's pretty much accurate. You're watching a countdown.
---
i dont know, it runs pretty poorly compared to any modern mmo but at least its prettier than most.
---
Im hoping theres no more new mounts this season. I’m already out of hotkeys!
---
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
---
higher effort than the content we are getting tho
---
Are you okay man? Do you need someone to talk to?
---
Remove this troll low effort
---
Mid-core player here, Elite specs are literally all I want out of this game. New playstyles and the like are my bread and butter. I will literally enjoy core tyria all over again with new specs to play around in them with.
---
Minions and elementals are [summons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Summon), pet is a different kind of npc
---
Oh? I never posted this artwork here before so if somebody did before me, I'm definitely not aware of it.
---
but for a player interested in the pvp side of things, that grind is completely out of focus and besides the point.
---
Try it out, it’s really great. GW2 has an incredible combat system so you always want to come back for more.
---
it's meant to be aimed at what they will release with the living story not towards the stream :)
---
I know, but they're pet-like.
---
The GW2 manifesto.
---
Shiverpeaks/icy zones arent my favorite since they tend to be a bit bland but Im still interested in seeing whats announced.
---
give me a revenant with gs
---
give me ANY class which use my sharur in the proper way which is fun
---
give me a ranger with a rifle 
---
let us use spear above water 
---
there is so much content to explore again and again . u keep on doing just ftactals and  raid but, as a veteran with more than 20k ap 5 legendaries and so on i will buy expansion even just for the elites .
---
Literally any fucking game as a service has grind to keep people playing and/or coming back. PvP only games have grinds for leaderboards, too. 
---
There's a world of difference between having to grind to keep your character at a relevant level / gear level to play the game versus collecting 2000 bear asses for a cosmetic item to wear
---
Pretty sure that's /u/JonAnet, he's great.
---
It says guild bank and there everything is logged. Besides how do you effektivly steal the siege?
---
If they announce an expansion like HoT , i'll be hyped , if they announce an expansion like PoF i won't even bother with it  , fuck PoF it's basically a mount/new Spec bundle other than that it's so shallow and plain .
---
That's not the point. The point is that you can't state opinions that are different from the popular view without getting shut down. That's frustrating and quite toxic. Me jerk? Yeah maybe a little bit, but these are platforms for people to talk and discuss things and not to be controlled with what you say. Removing posts, because the moderator has a different opinion, is toxic. People need a place to talk through things. I mean, just look at the comments here. You have the most useless comments, where people act like jerks. And so how is that different from what I say? How can they say "mean" things and I can't just because my opinion is different? That's the point. I'm just writing the post to see what other people think and all I get are facetious comments. The comments I see one gw2 forum and here are the opposite of what you're saying.
---
So, just to check. If I don't do the human quest part requiring the heat stones, the only thing I'll be missing out on is the prettier looking oven in the home instance, right? I won't be missing out on anything important to the actual 500 cooking operations?
---
I still have my Ancient Mew card.
---
Best post of the month!
---
remove this troll low effort
---
Of course, but saying that gw2 doesn't have grind is straight up a lie.
---
The problem with gw2 is ANET isnt good at consistently spreading out content over months. Things like OSRS survive with that model because they actually do it, there’s frequent updates and a decent stream of content.
---
The consistent updates have been consistently way off on their timings to the point where people dont really believe things like “4 raid wings a year” any more. At least an expansion promises a reasonable amount of content where living story isnt too consistent in that.
---
A bloodstone explosion? In your kitchen?
---
Again?!
---
[Completely guilty, but no shame!](https://i.imgur.com/gBL1NIM.png)
---
ayyyy
---
That may be true, but an expansion definitely gives people more of a reason to start playing the game or persuade others to join, so it brings in more players. I joined because a friend of mine was playing before PoF, but I ultimately started when there was a new expac because it was a good time to start. Likewise it’ll be hard to get friends to play just because there is a new living world season, but if there was an expansion, they will feel like its a better time to start playing.
---
Wonder why you deleted your other comment but not this one.
---
Hmmmm
---
Wvw is also a part of pvp in gw2, and it's pretty grindy at start considering that you need max level, good gear as well as hero points  to be relevant, which are all a lot easier to get in pve (and OP doesnt like doing pve).
---
Maybe if they sell it as a Season Pass, with full expansion + LS size content, but released across a full year.
---
Which modern MMOs run better than GW2? Many of them are unplayable when there's too many players nearby.
---
For the 1% discussion and 99% shitposting!
---
Jokes aside we know what we want we listed it thousends of times, And even if we are not agreeing on everything there is base things that all of us agree on more or less. Just like with raids or fractals. People have basic things that all need and want, and then there are other things were people not agreeing that is how life works over all. 
---
And we did not say fuck you we hate it for no reason. I can give you 50 game breaking bugs that litterally made it unplayable for the game mode. And even after those 50 there is still 50 more today that makes red border a punnishment.
---
cmon really
---
Now put aegis over it so we can't appreciate the detail  for authenticity 
---
/S
---
wouldn't have it any other way
---
Spoiled kids in Elona can stop whining and enjoy their new life as awakened.
---
&gt; The comments I see one gw2 forum and here are the opposite of what you're saying.
---
Again, read what I said.
---
I've been saying this since the first year, if it has to be an effect make it a subtle aura or the effect around the feet that one of the elite skills uses.
---
lol Just saw this, wtf man? Why come here to talk made shit if you don't even play or have a clue what you're talking about? Want me to copy and paste our discussion? How you've shown proof that you are coming from a stand point of ignorance. You lack the necessary knowledge to give grounds to any of your statements. So you're just misinforming any readers with your claims. You're being toxic towards something we actually enjoy and possibly turning away new players. You don't seem like you're crying but you do seem like an ass. 
---
This is what I'm seeing "burrr I'm angry at shit so I'm gonna shit on shit and shit... shit. Look at these shits! They are such lil biLches. Let me tell them how what them likes is no good. This is so fun talking shit ha ha ha. Now let me see what they are saying. Hey wait a minute! Why you talking shit to me?! Me no like this! Me mad cause they such lil flowers! How dare they respond negativity to me Toxicity in dis city in dis city it's murder it's murder" 
---
Pretty uncanny if you ask me.
---
I know your Asura! Cute!
---
I'm pretty sure he was in a DS meta today or yesterday
---
I think the Charr homelands have been taken over by Jormag
---
You guys need to stop. Memeing everything isn't funny.
---
Now that you mention it, he did talk like an asura.
---
How do you figure that?
---
In ep5 we only saw his head, while in ep6 we see him whole.
---
GW1 wasn't MMO to begin with. If they choose to keep GW2 alive, they will churn out expansions - MMOs tend to have reaaaaaly long life spans if they are worked on. IMHO, NCSoft wouldn't let Anet shut down GW2 for another 4-5 years so easily.
---
Oh hey, that's my charracter! :D
---
Thank you @pwnagekitten, it was a pleasure!
---
The dude can turn into dust storms and take an ephemeral form. Probably reshapes his size accordingly. 
---
Obviously, there are technical reasons as to why this happens.
---
Dwarves are cool and shouldn't be forgotten, but Norn need some love too.
---
It is both possible for people to "ironically" use it as a white power symbol and for people to use it as that sincerely. It might have started as a joke but all it's really done is made actual white supremacists adopt it.
---
[Where are all your Asura?! What did you do to them?!](https://i.imgur.com/MOk3WbR.jpg)
---
in the middle, thats a guy, right?
---
&gt;  leader could try asking support if they can see the account name who took items.
---
Support will not help with anything regarding guilds.
---
They let a hacker recover an account from someone in our guild, That hacker then proceeded to kicked everyone and stole the guild - Anet support refused to help.
---
There are only two servers. America and Europe.  
---
What you select is a "Home world" which is only used in World vs. World vs. World.  
---
(not something you have to worry about now)  
---
You can play with anyone in any "home world", but American and European servers are separate.
---
Thanks :)

DX 12 and PvP Balance Team aren't on there to crush my hopes and dreams

"Living World Season 5: Friend/Ships"
---
Now his friends have friends! It looks like Icebrood in the background honestly.
---
How about the fact that i already messaged him in a private chat yesterday. In fact i messaged him immediately after my first post and i already told him all of this because he was looking for a game with a challenging endgame. He wanted the option for pvp straight up told him that anet neglects everything thats not living world. But please continue on your meaningless rant that you started because i had the audacity to ask him what kind of content he was looking for. Obviously its much better to tell players to just sugar coated lies about the actual state of the game.
---
I'm guessing that Jormy invaded charr homelands. That's sad... I really want to see them with natural, non corrupted environment.
---
Completely possible, since my old guild and I may or may not have caused some trouble in Rata Sum in the past
---
&gt; That hacker then proceeded to kicked everyone and stole the guild - Anet support refused to help.
---
My old guild faced a similar situation but luckily, officer was alarmed, went online and guy was kicked out - sadly, he managed to remove half of the roster from spare account.
---
Nothing keeps OPs leader from trying to ask tho but yeah, I've read they don't get involved in with such players issues with guilds.
---
[They're still there!](https://i.imgur.com/NAs1sro.png) In fact, there are even more of them than there are sylvari on my account
---
Ranged can be good and fun but more in pvp and wvw than pve, to the best of my knowledge.
---
No Dulfy = no new skin showcase :(
---
And people still think that veteran/dedicated players leaving the game has no impact because gw2 is a casual game.
---
Holy shit you actually put Polymock on there. They said BEFORE RELEASE they were gonna have it. It's been 7 years. I've completely given up. ;_;
---
I saw on their guild show that the developer actually shrunk Kralk by a bit and the player character by a lot and did some camera trick so you can see the whole body.
---
I really hate they gate this kind of info from us, why keep it a secret if it ends up being shitty in the end?
---
We really need more insight on what content they make, i haven't played fractials in months and that's mostly because they keep on making them more "challenging" for same reward, honestly what's the point.
---
It was already fine at release. Playing HoT at release was the most fun open world I've done in this game. Mounts trivialize it, but it's still decent.
---
Again your place words in my mouth i never wrote. I never said get over your self. I said get over it. 
---
And now i am done, have a nice evening :)
---
if you're after textures, audio files etc, search for gw2browser
---
Let's see.. 7175 hours total on sylvari.. 5507 hours total on asura..whoops, guess you're too late already
---
Ah yes huge difference, mb yes that has an entirely different meaning. Goodbye 👋
---
Yep. I think I'm just chronically unlucky in GW2 for whatever reason :\
---
I mean, I wasn't there at release so I've only gone off what other people have said. I guess you'd know better than I.
---
I feel all these "icebrood charr warband" folks are setting themselves up for disappointment.
---
I only see the traditional icebrood norn. Center figure isn't a hunched charr. Those aren't glowing eyes. They're his icy chest. Its just https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Icebrood_Berserker.jpg this model. To the left is this model: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Icebrood_Norn.jpg
---
It isn't a Frost Legion. It's a brood of Ice (Jormag).
---
This is... Intimidating...
---
I doubt the SWTOR example. Got a friend that plays that game and has logged over 10k hours and he complained a lot in the past about poor performance and low fps in raids, especially when new ones came out (think it was the 16+ ones).
---
And yes he has quite beefy hardware.
---
I see you are ready for r/tinfoilhat, Nasiran. Well done, young padawan.
---
Are you telling me someone payed you to make a picture of your own character?
---
Yeah, that would help.
---
Holy sht /gw2g/ lives again just in time for announcement. Praise Joko
---
If you build guild siege or buy them from the guild merchant, they are stored in the storage tab as consumables. When you double klick it there, the blueprint goes into your inventory, but as this is not the guild bank, you can't find it in the logs. 
---
So if the guild decided to keep them as consumables, because they are easily accessible for the WvW-commanders who need them or some other reasons, everyone with the right permissions can take all of them.
---
People just didn't want to adjust. Every enemy in HoT is easy to counter with just some well timed dodges. They never nerfed HoT mobs to make them easier either IIRC.
---
Man. I only have nine characters, all 80. And not one of them has any Ascended gear.
---
Aw, thank you! :3  Was also super hyped my Ipos and Xiuquatl models were mentioned in the last guild chat episode. &lt;3
---
I definitely see a Charr in the middle, but I agree on the warband part. There could just be some Charr who joined Jormag for power, or got corrupted.
---
because when you have unlocked all the masteries for that zone the xp we get there is kinda useless so we  get a spirit shard instead
---
Done gorseval maybe 30 times, 3 infusions
---
Aye, I'm going to bet that at some point someone will make a tool that shows the cheapest foods to craft for salvaging into compost, but it'll still be absurd to try and even fill up your 4 free spaces per day that way.
---
Have Glyph of Bounty. Got 7 swings on the five nodes. Picked up two Varietal Peppercorn.
---
Yeah I actually agree with this, there's many points throughout both of those JPs where there is literally no way you can figure it out without trial and error and just keep dying until you get to where you want to. I did love the one in Siren's Landing as well but I would like one with a higher difficulty setting, kinda like with Not So Secret where you have very precise points that you have to land on and if you fail, you get rekt.
---
That is some apple to oranges comparison if ive ever seen one. It is about the amount of players and animations you see. If you have a 100 player in-action example at a decent framerate, come back. D2 is also a shooter - there are maybe 10 projectiles and a few onhit effects on screen at one time. 1/5th of the screen is taken by a gun and fov is low.   
---
Teso regularily gets the same threads on low fps (40 or less in towns) or think BDO when there are 20+ players fighting - it is horrible.   
---
Now i am not saying that there is no room for improvement (far from it), but as far as i can tell other games go out of their way to make sure there are never too many players in sight and severly limit playeroptions to make things like fields or summons.
---
Afaik Destiny doesn't have hundred of players on screen.
---
I think people vastly understimate how well GW2 performs. Is it perfect? Of course not, but we're doing far better than other games.
---
And don't even get me started on stuff like queues, server ping, download speed, etc.
---
Damn, I'm at about 800 or so and I've gotten a few Ghostlies
---
The chair I've never even seen someone get
---
Which limitations? No one here knows anything about the engine.
---
 Joko killeded Baltushar. He told us sho, himshelf
---
Tl'dr?
---
Small child becomes leader of fates razor
---
i doubt there is any remotely successful mmo out there that somehow only favors veterans and new players are just left behind
---
it makes absolutely no sense from any perspective for monetary gains, playerbase and many other reasons
---
not sure why people keep asking this silly question
---
i think you should use the search function or maybe your brain
---
I play WvW for fun.  So much of MMOs and doing content is tied to rewards and people forget playing for fun.
---
As for incentive to win a match besides fun, I don't know.  I'd like to win (though I won't sacrifice fun for it), but sadly it seems the majority only want big zerg fights.  Lots of people just don't care about points or defending or so much else because they just play WvW only for big zerg fights.  I'm not one of those.  I guess incentives may change that, but then again are those people playing for fun or the rewards?  
---
And sure, if you play for points, you do get big fights with that, but so many people really don't care and if it's up to them, it would be constant open field fights.
---
&gt;as far as i can tell other games go out of their way to make sure there are never too many players in sight and severly limit playeroptions to make things like fields or summons.
---
Maybe anet should have thought of the same thing then. If they can't live up to the technical challenge they themselves set, they should have at least designed around it.
---
Perhaps you should bring up a thread with all those spots so it can get upvoted and seen.  They fixed many with the warclaw and many of those they didn't know until people told them.
---
Nope. Backpack + Ring + Amulet.
---
&gt; No matter what that's gonna piss off a lot of people. Even woodenpotatoes was saying if they just talked about LW then the game would be in dire straits  
---
I believe he also brought up the possibility that the developers would be able to move away from expansions and just go off a LW+gem store from this point forward to keep the game alive. Probably not the most ideal place for the game to be, but better than dying off after all those firings.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars_2#Gameplay
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 uses a heavily modified version of the proprietary game engine developed for Guild Wars by ArenaNet. The modifications to the engine include real-time 3D environments,[2] enhanced graphics and animations[13] and the use of the Havok physics system.[2] The developers say the engine now does justice to the game's critically acclaimed concept art, and that concept art will be integrated into the way the story is told to the player.[14]
---
It was not built from the scratch.
---
This is like Creation Engine which was used for  The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. Each time even more modified than for previous game. If you played at least Skyrim and Fallout 4 you will see how many specific bugs these 2 games share and developers inability to get rid of them.
---
Sylas is a huge sweetheart, good job on him!!!
---
Heres the difference. In 1.0 of ff14 the game was so fucking terrible that square eventually didnt make it required for players to pay for it. 2 years later they communicated with their playerbase and dedicated fans and reworked the game from the ground up over the course of 2 years. Anet however doesnt actually communicate with their playerbase outside of pre recorded "live streams" and bi yearly roads map plans.
---
Dolyak.
---
Thank you so much. :)
---
Nah, best MMO is strictly a matter of opinion. There is no best MMO. There's only a best MMO for me. Out of all the MMOs I've tried, this one most closely matches what I personally want from an MMO.  And you can join older players pretty easily when compared to most other MMOs. Not sure what you're actually disagreeing with.
---
Why Mention X-Pac and not the rest of Degeneration X?
---
Well, I have a full home and now 12 garden spaces. I'm hoping that my garden itself will at least give me the seeds to make the next day's seed packets.
---
I'm actually hoping that Anet will realize what this will do to the TP and crafting market. In the long term there isn't enough material available to salvage.
---
Prices on some items have already tripled and even a good coordinated guild will have trouble to keep ascended food available.
---
This is really cool, trying not to get myself hyped though!
---
Same story here, saw it on Yogscast, looked like a phenomenal game, forgot about it, then on the day it launched I bought it and played the shit out of it.
---
It's subjective, there is no way someone can say that this is the best MMO to play for anyone except for themselves.
---
All anyone can really do is just tell you the facts and what we like and don't like about it. Off the top of my head here is a list of pros and cons from me:
---
*Pros:*  
---
- Great artstyle and very nice color palettes used  
---
- Best cosmetics systems I've seen out of any MMO, in particular with gear transmutes and especially dyes  
---
- Most fluid and comfortable general movement/jumping I've felt with any MMO  
---
- Very good combat system, either tied with Blade &amp; soul or slightly behind for me in terms of how fun and engaging the combat feels  
---
- Core game dungeons are unique to any other game's dungeon experiences I've ever experienced, and while they are very outdated they still bring me joy to do  
---
- No vertical progression so as a result it is very easy to take breaks and not feel pressured from missing out on stuff simply for having a life  
---
- *By far* the best mounts I've seen of all the MMOs I've tried  
---
- Gem store/microtransactions aren't as intrusive and influential on a player's success as a lot of other games (not P2W)  
---
*Cons:*  
---
- While the systems in place for cosmetics is great, the lack of options for casual attire can be off-putting. For example with heavy armor I haven't seen a single skin released since 2014-2015 that has been better for human female than aetherblade leggings. Also the meme with medium gear is that most of the tops have unremovable buttcapes and that anet has a fetish for trenchcoats. This is a meme based off of truth; the lack of options for skins can be frustrating  
---
- Combat system while being great suffers from generally very uninspired balance changes. For example whenever there is a balancing update I'm always thinking "Great let's see what they've ruined now" rather than when I played other games I felt hyped to see what new stuff my class is getting. With this game it's far more common to see things taken away rather than given in terms of balance updates, and often times in the case of mesmer you are left wondering if it's in the job description to be on bath salts in order to be on the balancing team at anet.  
---
= Very slow release cadence for content updates. Regardless of what anyone here will try to tell you, the fact of the matter is that this game doesn't do a very good job at maintaining player retention compared to some of the other giants in the industry and that is largely due to how long it takes for content to be released which doesn't keep most players busy for as long of a time as they would like.    
---
- Adding to the above point about poor player retention, the lack of difficult content in this game has been a problem for many many years. The raids on this game are puggable and very reliably so, and worst of all both of the recent waid wings if I'm not mistaken were even cleared on the first day which is depressing.  
---
- GW2 is by far one of the most casual-friendly MMOs ever made which is both a good and bad thing. Good for obvious reasons, but bad because it leads to players burning out from a lack of a need to get better at anything because the majority of content is designed so that *anyone* can do it.  
---
- No DirectX11 or 12 support, meaning no multi-threaded rendering, meaning very shitty utilisation of modern day CPUs (and ultimately GPUs)  
---
- No officially supported DPS meter
---
My guess? Valium and Alcohol.
---
But there are MMOs were catching up is horribly hard and a chore. There are MMOs where starter zones are dead because vets never need to return to them. People who have started other MMOs late have had mixed experiences. That's why people ask.
---
I'd buy a new character slot instantly if that were true
---
That's wonderful!!! &lt;3
---
The implementation of said system will naturally be shower than in tech due to differences in game dev vs software dev. That said, having a 3-4 times a year cadence (more if you count PvP, Balance, and festival changes) of smaller patches vs a large expansion is still going to be more stable and easier to maintain as the change set and potential places things can go wrong
---
Thank you :)
---
Maybe consider buying a second pee bucket to keep next to the computer? :3
---
I don't think there's much they can do to get outside the box attention except announcing major new content, and making all their content free to play
---
I don't think the buy to play model is working for the game, and it's impossible to grow their player base that way at this point.
---
As a linux player, I would be over the moon. But as a necromancer I have to ask (as cutely as possible), "Can I have an.. undead penguin mount??"
---
Also, could we put cooking stations at WvW keeps so I can sentry and get my chef on at the same time.
---
I have been saying for months that I think elite specs are coming in LWS 5 , and that they would be charged for. It just attracted down votes. A LOT of them. Now, people are all finally on the elite spec LWS5 train. But saying , "not free" is still attracting down votes , haha.
---
I think we will get them , and all at once.
---
ah yes, I loooooooved EQ2. I also played Paladin and Shadowknight (and Coercer) there. Great game, just super dated now.
---
"Luminous Arc" was a pretty fun video game series , actually.

I would like to be able to travel from one end of the world to the other without loading zones or artificial walls far away from the zone border. (Looking at you, Diessa Plateau, Iron Marches and Temple of Balthazar...)
---
spear as a main weapon? fucking yes pls
---
I was so confused by UW weapons on land because all I could think was Underworld.
---
Thank you both for answering! All masteries from HoT/PoF/seasons respectively, yes?
---
Jona, will we love tommorows announcement?
---
Looks like a gemstore skin for warclaw.
---
and then you don't screenshot it until 4 hours later x)
---
awesome. too bad he's not with anet anymore. love his work
---
It depends on what map you're in. In Tyria, once you've completed the Tyria mastery tracks, exp will go towards shards.
---
In Heart of Maguuma, as well as Season 3 areas, once you've completed the HoT mastery tracks, exp will go towards shards.
---
In Elonia, as well as Season 4 maps, once you've completed the PoF mastery tracks, exp will go towards shards.
---
This. I was clicking through all his chat options thinking I'd miss something. But no, I had to go OUT of the home instance to buy stuff I needed. How do they never use common sense for this stuff?
---
I'm sorry Shaun.
---
That "content" has been dying at an essentially terminal pace.  It's been in a negative feedback loop now for years and even by shrinking the number of server tiers from the 8 originally to now just 4 for NA those tiers are very often dead on most maps even during NA prime time.  Reset is the only high pop night and we can't even queue all maps as a T1/2 "full" server anymore like what would occur 1y+ ago.
---
wanted a new game when i was 11, went to my local game store and asked for a fun game. got guildwars, 10/10 .
---
No, about 20 minutes as the train ended soon after. I took the screenshot at 16:21 my time.
---
Server time on the minimap is four hours ahead of my time zone.
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see Dual Spec/Multi classing *eventually*. I doubt they will announce it Friday but I do expect it one day.
---
Guild Wars 2
---
Living W"orld"
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Link? :P
---
It does well enough for my needs in PvE. I don't really follow the min/max of classes. I generally run Staff/Staff Mirage. But when running trains, I run Axe/Focus for the 4 Skill Speed Boost as I'm always on foot so I don't leave people without mounts behind.
---
I made an account just to talk about this. Arenanet and the Guild Wars series will always hold a special place within me.   
---
I discovered Guild Wars Prophecies back when I was in middle school, through a friend who played it at the time. I don't remember exactly, but I think he found the game a bit boring at the time (he later returned to it a few years later). The late nights I had through leveling, capturing skills, exploring sorrow's furnace over and over again...man, that's my childhood and I'll never regret those years. I met some really cool people in game, and had a relationship with someone special for a little over two years. I met some strong IRL friends through this series, and Arenanet will always have my thanks for that.   
---
I've been around this series since a year after the beginning. I remember stealing Factions from Wal-Mart (couldn't afford it), and for Nightfall..I walked myself to the store and bought it around midnight. I've been playing Guild Wars 2 since head start and I haven't really taken much of a break from it. I'm currently in my last semester of graduate school and I still play...albeit not nearly as much. Thanks for everything, Anet! You may not get everything right, and that's okay...love you all the same and will probably be playing years ahead from now!
---
then shouldn't you be asking why the game comes with 5 character slots as well?
---
Yeah seriously. I've played MTG before I even got into Guild Wars and his artwork he's done for WoTC is crazy. Here's probably my favorite one that he's done  [https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/f/f/ff204024-20a5-4bb9-82b6-f6b4337efd60.jpg?1552226335](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/f/f/ff204024-20a5-4bb9-82b6-f6b4337efd60.jpg?1552226335)

[YES!](https://media.giphy.com/media/Lr3UeH9tYu3qJtsSUg/giphy.gif)

Rough screenshot, I panicked. Kinda looks like Eir in the shiver peaks, there is a Charr with a flaming sword standing behind them. I assume Rytlock
---
There are 6 total weapons that an ele can potentially use: staff, dagger, scepter, focus, warhorn (HoT), sword (PoF)
---
You can also make other characters from different professions and use for them.
---
I dont see the livestream on on IG. Maybe they took it down?
---
Oh man, imagine the potential. The player character charging into the Shiverpeaks alongside the full might of the charr war machine. A group of warbands manipulated in the same way as the Sons of Svanir into fighting for the dragon. A mixture of the Blood Legion Homelands and the Shiverpeaks environs as the ice dragon steadily expands its domain east.
---
The only way the got to be such a massive MMO was marketing to casuals tired of a subscription fee. If they did this, I personally would leave as well as many others.
---
&gt; It was created for large groups (at least three) 
---
Is this a joke. No offense, but this is a ripe moment to say "Git Gud"
---
The interview is over :( it was suuuper quick. I just saw a notification on my phone and rushed to see it before it ended. It was super echoey as I think they were just standing in a hallway? Couldn't understand much.
---
It was only up for like 5 minutes, the livestreams on IG aren't saved after they end, I believe.
---
"I panicked" this is a mood. I'm so excited I can't sleep
---
Shame! they were quick in taking it down, probably a mistake. And yes they arent saved indeed.
---
And oddly enough they don't cater to the minority who restricts themselves to one thing. Shocking, I know!
---
I should mention btw: i was a huge gw1 fan, tried gw2 for a few months, then quit pretty much entirely for about 2 years, only ever logging on for a bit during the end of lion's arch story.
---
As a fan of GW1 it wasn't at all what I wanted.  And even now, I'd like a potential GW3 to bring back some of the stuff I'm missing about the mechanics and theming of GW2, though I've warmed to it now.
---
This is just to say GW1-2 wasn't a smooth transition for everybody, and there are always going to be people who drop off during series transitions.
---
I'm currently playing Destiny, and I straight left the match I was in to watch the livestream.
---
Read the comment again, im not saying that Anet is going to fail
---
I'm saying that unrealistic hype can lead to disappointment because the hype train doesn't care about what is practical - a hype train is more like a wish list that everyone has an opinion about, and at the end of the day, people can only get upset
---
I don't mind playing on the Desert Borderlands, but it suffers a bit from having a bunch of narrow passages and choke points that discourage engaging the enemy unless you're suicidal or they're AFK. Add to that a lot of winding roads and verticality and you get a lot of extra travelling to get around those choke points.
---
I think most organised groups play for the fights, so anything that stands in the way of that is seen in a negative light. I think people playing other game modes would react the same way if arenanet implemented changes that arbitrarily slowed down what they were doing.
---
I just want Seimur to sell me the typical materials I might need, without having to go to another cook.
---
they can drop 3 varietal seeds (maybe more?) per node. no other node i've found has acted that way i'm guessing it's unintended
---
you downvote because I ask a question. Great "Community"
---
I see, thanks. Do you have a build for fighting in PvE at hand?
---
3-4 times a year is too slow of a content flow though. Either the content gets blazed through in a couple days, or it's artificially extended by external time gating. *Especially* when raids and fractals are taking turns and a new raid wing represents much more one-time and repeated content than a fractal does. Once "solved", a new fractal adds *variety* to the fractal community's daily routine, but a new raid adds *another thing to do per week* forever to the raider's weekly routine.
---
Nobody's out there competing for world first on new fractal releases, and the "lab work" on fractals isn't as in depth as the stuff for raids is. Raids give the "release day blind run" one time content which brings very memorable moments, as well as first time CM content, and then leaves a whole wing behind to do every week and optimize and experiment with.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke
---
its like saying Condi warrior was viable using base warrior
---
There is a reason why new specs have new weapons and traits. The importance of the two aforementioned things are so vital to how well something can function
---
This conversation is ridiculous- no one needs to explain this to you wtf...
---
You are wrong in judging me
---
Oh I know, still makes no sense lol. Salvage gear and you break it down to the metal, leather, cloth, runes, etc. Salvage an omelette, you're somehow completely reverse cooking it back into an egg lol
---
The return of the Stone Summit Dwarves would be a truly WTF announcement. Didn't only the Deldrimor turn to stone?
---
If they did they they'd be better off switching to a sub fee, and neither would make the playerbase happy. GW2's *biggest* selling point is the low barrier to entry compared to other MMOs.
---
You delete you post because of some downvotes? How "self-loyal"
