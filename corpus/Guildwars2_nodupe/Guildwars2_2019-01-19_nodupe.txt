They complete it because they are getting carried an the content is in my opinion undertuned relative to what you should expect from end-game content. I will not call a 2k dps ranger with double bear and minstrel gear competent for killing a champion.

---
Oh okay, I planned on going for mirage in the end. It seems really offensive focused which I thought was cool.

---
I tried out chaos but it seemed more support like.
---
Why does that 8 year old have boobs?
---
Oh right, anime.  
---
I do think the possibility of obtaining rewards for the time invested should be available quite early, yes. I would like to dedicate the effort getting rewards, let that be gold value or just genuine enjoyment out of better matches, while I play the mode and not just being forced to grind 50 lvls to begin to dedicate then my play time into those things just because Anet doesn't want to moderate and punish afk and bot play.
---
Making it harder for new players is sentencing the mode to rot and die, WvW says hello.
---
base necro has a few support skill lines, each specializing in a specific aspect of the class
---
Minions - Necros have the ability to summon multiple minions to assist in taking damage and dealing it along with active skills for each that deal damage on top of a condition.
---
Spectral - These focus on building up Life Force for the necro's Shroud mechanic as well as added movement and raw support. 
---
Corruption - These are the skills your gf is probably referring to.  Necros can inflict conditions on enemies at the cost of inflicting a condition on themselves too.  In conjunction with Plague Signet (see below) and a few other skills in their arsenal, Necros can immediately transfer said self-inflicted conditions to enemies as well.  It also has one of the Necro mainstay skills as far as meta is concerned, Epidemic, which bounces conditions on the target to enemies around it.
---
As others have said, core necro is pretty tanky as far as core professions are concerned with the help of the Shroud.  It has access to ok but not great damage, opting into longer engagements when soloing the story but with far less risk involved.  It's probably one of the better solo professions long term as the Reaper and Scourge elite-specs are pretty self sufficient going through the story and can dish out decent damage when played right.  It's not really a super meta profession as far as raiding/fractals are concerned but they are handy in certain scenarios especially with epidemic still being as strong as it is.
---
Good on ya! I got world competition a few months back, and managed to finish up maguma a month or two ago.

exactly!

It would be perfect if they did this.  I'd upvote you again if I could :)

No DirectX 12/11 No Multi threat optimization!

The biggest problem with this game! Is only this! that makes new players and old stay away!
---
Some people might say that says something about the crafting system in gw2.
---
NORN masterrace!

But she ded tho

what armor is that?

The only positive back then was that you could buy the gift of battle.

Uhhh ... how lol 
---
Whereas Stonemist 3-ways tend to be a real shitstorm because both invader forces REALLY need to break through. And if all 3 forces make it inside, then that's where the fun really begins.
---
Death is but a doorway...
---
It's honestly really strong, we've had 3 years of playing Chrono and basically zero time spent playing FB/Ren so I wouldn't be surprised if it was optimal in more places than we'd think.
---
Pugs and double healer groups I can say almost definitely will see an increase in DPS increase swapping over to a more FB/Ren oriented setup.
---
Which settings and why they make such a huge difference?
---
&gt; because there's not enough players   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; That has nothing to do with fresh blood at all 
---
Yes, it kinda does, or at least it doesn't get any better were fewer people to play games, even at low tiers. If people enjoy the mode and keep playing they'll rise eventually to populate the top while new players need to keep coming to maintain a healthy population. I don't see how the proposed changes would help at all with the problem of top tiers battling low tiers? I don't see how it could help at all.
---
**STOP!**
---
Think about the rune/sigil crafting.
---
Think about guild hall materials.
---
If ArenaNet were to "improve" crafting, it'll just become far more expensive!
---
Canach went double-or-nothing on you vs. Kralkatorrik. He's going to be the villain of LWS5, much stronger than he ever was at Southsun Cove.

Stonemist isn't nearly as fun now that its t3 every prime with each side having massive queue but nobody able to form groups organised enough to survive under pressure longer than 5 mins. 
---
Stonemist has been scrubs farming scrubs abusing how OP am has become, with fights being increasingly more rare the last 3 years.

What part of that is "inner". You're visible like permafrost dye in VB.

I already commented this on your Alacrity Renegade video but gonna post it here so everyone can see as well " Great video but I have some suggests to the rotation. During Kalla, you should use the healing skill in the rotation as well,  because it only costs 5 energy and bring an addition 8s of  protection+some healing(\~4k total)+ -50% taken condi dmg(maybe useful in  fractal). I have tested the dps using the rotation with and without  sword skill #4 , and I have noticed NO DIFFERENCE in dps. Futhermore, it  is a dps LOSS if you dont have quickness(1\~2k lower), so I suggest you  to avoid using sword skill#4 and keep the energy for other skills, feel  free to test it out." 
---
Alacrigade.
---
Nice shield, but are you really a Herald?
---
Manuals are not a book, cub.
---
Infinite potions are a pretty good use if you like fractals. 
---
You dont need extra dps from chronos at all. Im even fine with 1k chronos, if fail dps check, I will kick dpsers 1st.
---
[See Also:](#s "Hey everyone, meet Blish. He'll endure several sympathy-building moments like getting turned off and being stuck in the inactive shell of his own golem body and be super useful then get killed off horribly scarcely 3 episodes after he's introduced.")
---
I don’t do them for the rewards, but I enjoy doing them. It’s because I mostly spend my time in instanced content (dungeon, fractal, PvP) so being out in the world is like a nice vacation. YMMV. 
---
springer high jumped up there and rez’d :D
---
Renegade 10-man alacrity hits 100% uptime at ~78% boon duration. While the execution on the alacrity is trivially simple, I personally feel that ~90% boon duration is a more consistent goal if there are no other sources of alacrity since this gives about a second of buffer time between F4 activations. Anything less than that feels inconsistent in practice due to mistakes and mechanics.
---
If you have a second source of alacrity (such as a Chrono with Shield5 and SoI), then 78% is more than enough. Alternately, if you only care about 5-man alacrity (fractals), then the Ventari tablet can help cover gaps for healing builds.
---
I’d go with power warrior. Banner build is meta for end game, complex enough in needing to stack damage modifiers before unleashing big attacks and Axe4 + Axe5 just kills everything in open world. 
---
That all seems pretty hard for something fairly easy (and fluid). Practice in fractals and open world pve and you should have your play down fast enough
---
If mordremoth could attack the mother tree in the grove. He can attack anywhere!
---
20 sec loading times with ssd and  20 fps? no thx.
---
The warhorn is kinda hard to see over all that jazz. Dyejobs is leaking
---
Then your perspective is woefully limited. I am sorry.
---
you cant port to pvp lobby for free and do same exact thing for free.
---
Pretty much always Laurels.
---
Experience is just flat out useless. There is never a reason to pick that one.
---
Ascended is worth an average of like 8g. A max of 13. Less than the others.
---
Legendary *was* useful in that it provides Obsodian Shards and items made from Obsidian Shards. Way back then Obsidian Shards were hard to obtain, but these days there are multiple ways in every game mode. Even the gold cost of the crafted material isn't that high. If you were actively working on a legendary this isn't an *awful* pick.
---
Laurels however are time gated. The only way to get them is log in rewards and a negligible amount from achievements. Ascended Recipes, Novelty Items, and even certain new weapon skins require them. And even if you have run put of stuff to buy, you can simply convert them to gold via buying materials at a rate that slightly edges out Legendary.
---
So if I want to run supprt FB with heals and quickness,harrier is still my best bet? Also can viper FB really sustain 100% quickness with only FB runes?
---
Love the idea, hope to see more :D
---
No boss uses toughness as an aggro mechanic in fractals.
---
Ele is in kind of a lucky spot.
---
Every weapon is meta or good enough in at least 1 area. (That is not to say everywhere. Probably wouldn't run a Scepter/Warhorn Tempest in raids, but it's decent enough in Fractals, for example)
---
So it really comes down to what you like the look of. Personally I am a fan of Binding of Ipos, the new Focus, and a lot of Ele builds use Focus. Or if you like Weaver Sword, Bolt fits the theme.
---
The skill bar slot for novelty items is a relatively recent addition.
---
I think it is:
---
Wizard's Hat
---
Tempest Loop
---
Exalted Gloves
---
Leystone chest/legs/shoes
---
Well, it’s decided. I was on the fence about it earlier, but tomorrow I’m calling my doctor and getting a testosterone prescription. 
---
Wow, that's quality armor!
---
I’m gonna bet on Nevermore, the raven staff. While not exactly meta, staff can still be useful for ele. 
---
It really depends on your toon’s look though. For example there’s two types of legendary focus atm: The Minstrel and The Binding of Ipos. The former is brighter coloured whereas the latter looks super cool and dark. I chose Minstrel for my Guardian because she has a light coloured fashion wars theme. 
---
I wouldn't worry about it. As ArenaNet puts it, "[GMs are overly generous on the amount of time that players are given to respond.](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Please-a-clear-statement-re-AFK-farming/6162437)"
---
There's a small chance you'll get relocated or temporarily banned if you forget that you're logged in or have to leave due to some emergency, though.
---
Thanks. Bifrost is shiny. I like that. But last time before I took a break Staff Ele took a big hit and became really poor state. I will make it after this one. Really like the rainbow effect.
---
Imagine being the JP designer who did the one in Ember Bay. Everyone waits for a mesmer squad to port them and no one does the after getting the achievement.
---
Thanks, come again 
---
Did you just assume their class? D:D:D:D:
---
For shame on you good pronoun! 
---
Ah that's a shame, but sure I'll check again and try some older ones, thanks. Maybe I'll  try fan art if I can't find any of that ANet goodness to fit my needs. 
---
yup
---
I COULDN'T DECIDE ON A NAME
---
Reminds me of Beast Castle at Disney World. Awesome work.
---
Making a Legendary is tough work but totally worth it. I have 5 legendaries and my favourite is The Ascension (PvP backpiece). Although The Ascension is the cheapest legendary to craft in the game, holy shit the PvP grind. 
---
Among my Legendaries, The Ascension took the most time and effort. So it’s my favourite. Good thing it looks great :)
---
Oh it's 100% a learning experience, my guild runs fell flat on their faces the first time we tried it until we ironed out its strengths/weaknesses.
---
chronos job is to increase group DPS as much as possible (with some utility)
---
I haven't even PvP more than 30 matches =)) One of these days I swear I will find the motivation to do it... One day...
---
Yeah, Chrono has solid damage these days. Chronomancer is focused on power damage (direct damage), while Mirage is focused on damage over time. Both are really, really fun. I think I enjoy Chrono's utility more, but I like Mirage's weapon attacks with the axe more. They're both really fun.
---
I see the message... I shall doot for her every night.
---
Alrighty. I’ll be sure to try both out then! Chrono sounds like my type of thing, but mirage just sounds cooler lol
---
O_____O
---
Few k dps on Chronos is not really mandatory, maybe its only good for speed run. 
---
As a player who has survived cancer while playing GW2.....I demand this be in the next expansion. I want my dragon maid harem now! Don't make me play the cancer card! But I totally will. 
---
*cough cough*
---
How do I decide between Snowcrows's Inspiration Domination or Inspiration Duelling builds? 
---
FUN DETECTED! Oh wait, wrong game.
---
I like the idea but the fighting and the 3rd person view are really distracting from the scenery (not going to talk about obnoxious legendaries). I still enjoy any GW2 related videos :)

Hey! Returning player, just started playing again this week after being gone for almost exactly a year. I just hit 80 on my first character, i have both expacks and plan on being invested in PvE like fractals, then maybe WvW eventually.
---
About the gemstore: should i get the Mistlock Lounge Pass? It sounds like people really like this lounge, and the convenience sounds good on the surface, but is the QoL worth the price? I also plan on getting the Copperfed Salvage at some point, i know that that’s very agreed upon to be worth it
---
That's really cool!
---
Typical php dev sadly. 
---
So I read through it, and if I understood correctly spear is the only weapon that benefits from the stance switching? I feel like that could be problematic, like how Engi Sword is the only weapon that benefits from heat.
---
I did the same picture long time ago for my community, back when she was born in the living story.
---
After almost a year i joined a guild that had that image as the cover of their whatsapp group, lol.
---
Funny part was that i also included my thief in some photos, and they didnt recognized him even if it was my main for raid for a while
---
wow I've never seen a GPU mounted like that before. What is it sitting on and how do you reach the dp/hdmi ports?
---
I am blind and deaf and all I know is rage.
---
Gambling is legal in Elona, you know.
---
Actually, scepter/warhorn fresh air tempest is awesome in raids right now!
---
he's cute 
---
More violets, I say. Less violence.
---
Right? What child deletes their items and characters after tilting. Smh.
---
Well i didint expect it to become the grand idea of the millenium. The well you can remove the hilt and tip zone and instead give the weapon the range instead. 
---
The main idea with the Stance mechanic, was to give warriors an option to use a more non-weapon swap based build. Becuse we are stuck for the most part in Defence and Discplin (most in PvP and WvW situations) 
---
And to be fair, it grows a bit tierdsome to use same trait lines over and over again. And not make somthing else.
---
In part 2, i will talk about implomanting the Stance idea to all the other weapons. Not only spear.  Also in part 2  i will talk about the healing, Utility and traits aswell
---
The lich stool.
---
Valkyrie on guardian is way riskier than valkyrie reaper, just because of how relatively uncommon retaliation is compared to vulnerability. Nearly everyone outputs vuln, but only other guardians give retal.

As someone who is part of the LGBT community, fuck off. It's a defining characteristic of the character he's talking about. They didn't have anything else defining them as a character. It's apt.

Oh there was?  I had no presence on reddit until last year.  That's crazy how those guys knew immediately.  I wonder if season 4 has done anything like this that'll pay off in the final episode?

Necro in pve is extremely easy to play and survive on.  Necro has rarely been part of the endgame meta in pve and when they are it's usually some niche build for specific scenarios. You can still use necro for endgame content but there are almost always better options unfortunately. I've held out hope they gain a stronger role in pve but after 6+ years it just seems anet wants it to be a pvp class.
---
Necro is really good in pvp but I dont have much pvp experience to talk about it.
---
Guardian is in a pretty good spot right now for pve. Dragonhunter is a great power burst spec. Firebrand gives a good condi spec and also can play healer and quickness boon support. So it's a very versatile class in pve. 
---
Guardian is good in WvW.
---
In the end, choose what you like thematically (odd you chose these two because they are literally polar opposite themes, light or dark lol) and what feels good to play as. And will depend on what modes you enjoy more. 
---
This game is also very easy to get all classes to max level eventually so try them out and if you wind up not liking it you can try something else.
---
Perfect, thank you!

For me, music is always an obnoxious element in these kind of videos. I want to hear the actual footage.

When the 2000-series chips came out, you were able to use x370 boards with a BIOS update. I strongly assume 300- and 400-series chipsets will work just fine after another BIOS update, but obviously I can't know anything for sure.

This bug is stupid but no response from anet about the fix is even more funny to watch. Thank god I don't care about achievements but levels of frustration this company creates for their customers with every patch is mind blowing.
---
Please think again on it, don't waste a so good account and so many hours of "work" and fun. Can't be so bad, try to contact the main support and come back! In addition I really loved your site, I love how the inventories are displayed, all in a single page, I can check which chars have free slots and have a general idea where the things are stored. Please, keep the site up at least, or someone put online anywhere, it is a double waste! 
---
Hope you come back in game again soon!
---
agreed to this
---
I have limited free time, the time I spend in game is the time I deliberately set aside to play the game. I'm going to get as much fun out of that time as possible. That's what I meant by it :)
---
My raid group have been tackling the FB/Ren since the SoI nerf, and it's pretty good/consistent for average skilled raiders. The Stab/Aegis/Prot along with the 10-man 90-100% alacrity uptime is amazing for folks like me that struggle with playing Chrono.
---
Although I think the only weakness I've ran into are bosses that require a lot of moving/spreading around like Matthias/SH, but it can be fixed by having someone bringing a 3rd healer.
---
Guess I won't be able to play the game then. Thank you for answering. How sad the customer service is so bad. Been over a week I don't think support will ever answer me.
---
Effectively I suppose this isn't going to work on cell

Have you checked Metabattle for builds? [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Necromancer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Necromancer)

Kim Taek-jin, NCSoft's CEO bought a decent chunk of them, increasing his own stake in the company from 10% to 12%, but by-and-large the shares were just sold off openly to investors that wanted them.
---
Nexon was only ever involved because they wanted to take over NCSoft entirely, and when it became clear that wasn't happening Nexon moved on.
---
You can also train your rota pretty good in the PoF maps. Just find an HP or a vet hydra or a bounty or a bored elite and happily chop away. I find this beneficial as you are in a real combat situation and need to react to your environment / enemy behavior. This will sharpen your movement skills while practicing the rota in parallel. 
---
Why not some assassin pieces on chrono to get to 100% crit chance? 
---
Looks more like "(Server vs Server) vs Server" to me...

This exact thing happened to me. My female human was called him sometimes and I was spoken to as a non human as well... made me feels awks as my character’s parents were part of the shining blade lmao

Well, the commanders do, over a cup of tea.
---
Reaper is a very mediocre dps for end game PvE unfortunatley, it does have some uses ofcourse, such as nice cleave damage and vulnerability uptime which can be handy during split phases of bosses, but unfortunatley for necro, holosmith can also output a lot of vuln and has decent cleave. Holo is very strong especially in pug groups because it can output a large amount of cc (which is usually a bit of struggle) while doing competetive damage.  
---
New player here, what class should i chose , and what profession / weapon for dps raiding
---
does race matter? or is it just visuals
---
I like 2 daggers , or 2 swords,
---
They’re never going to fix it. They’re going to leave it like that forever. 
---
So here we are:
---
Queen The Commander of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, Lady of Dragonstone, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

Support seems to take 3-4 days usually. Try the password recovery process again. 
---
Also, double check you're not doing something silly like typing your username or password out wrong, capitals are in the right places etc.  Unlikely, but it happens. Type it out again in Notepad or something and copy it in, making sure there's no space at the end or anything like that. 
---
I once spent an hour trying to get back into my Google account, assuming my password was wrong somehow but it turned out I had a capital letter in the wrong place when I write it out and it wasn't until I looked at it in Notepad it clicked. 
---
Could it had been an old email address? Do you have the original emails from Anet confirming the account? 
---
Yes. I've tried this, frequently. It happens irl with traffic lights as well.
---
See that anvil? Repair your own gear!
---
I'm not the person to ask, but I find engineer has a lot of flexibility in everything they do
---
Sure that's a viable build as well. I got the idea somewhere that you can stack more condi with scepter and staff with infinite horizon. Haven't actually checked, so couldn't say 
---
very nice
---
The GM I had on contact with this ticket is stupid, I opened a 2nd ticket on the US support, they never bothered to respond. They don't read what I wrote ans they didn't care about me, so I don't want to care about this game, that's simple like that.  
---
Exemples : 3 times I explained the weird bug I had (I even explained the bug : seeing 244 as quantity instead of 500 because of 8th bit in the binary number representation : 500 -256 = 244) and I gave screenshots. And later they read that I was spoken about a bug and asked me about screenshots ... I politely send the screenshots a 4th time ... that's only ONE example of the lots of stupids things they do.

Largos is a condi-oriented fight where you shouldn't be taking frost spirit to begin with... the power damage increase on condi mirages isn't worth it compared to Sun/Storm/Stone.

Oh sorry, this comment wasnt meant to come across as negativ.
---
Well I play chrono since HoT in raids/fractals and you feel a bit less godlike and you are more dependant on your teammates.
---
I still count it as "bad", because for many it just means less "fun". I guess this feeling will disappear in the future.
---
Yes, I already did with a company where I worked : I said they made shit I will leave if they continue, they continued, I left and they asked to keep me while offering a bigger income, I refused and continued my way.
---
Eheh I love these discussions about the often under appreciated aspects of the game. 
---
Some vistas will give you a view over the area that you cannot get any other way. And some of them will point out a path to a hidden area or JP 
---
Example: the one in Lion's Arch that leads way into the pirate JP... 
---
Speaking of which, and apologies for the offtopic, that moment when he says "and now you're stuck here with me" at the end, unaware that you can just open your interface and WP out of there eheheh priceless..

Gotta say the amount of small details in this game is unending. 
---
What are your favourite views whose cinematic leads into a hidden area/gem? 
---
Every loading screen is fanart so I think they are up to something 🤔

You're welcome. &lt;3

Nope : I didn't care about gold. That's the stupid exchange which triggered me with a GM stupid beyond real.

It's really annoying if you have any skill that moves you as part of your rotation. I.E Hilt Bash and Gazelle F2 on Power Soulbeast. Feels like you have an extended aftercast.

sure, just dont do it with turrets active, just waypoint and stop getting loot while using notepad or other apps besides gw2 if you cant keep your attention on it.

Yeah its definitely jarring. I can't decide if I like it or hate it yet though. Reality IS jarring after a loss. I ran around the forge desperately trying to get Taimi or someone to talk to me, tell me what to do next. No one would. From a story standpoint it almost felt like they were too upset to talk but I didn't hang around for ambient chatter to kick off. 
---
I like the idea of ending with no plan, no hope, no ideas. But thinking that's where we have to sit for 3 months or more til next chapter!? They're either gonna pick up like no time passed or treat it like everyone has been off dealing with it emotionally, and I hope whatever they go with I done well because I really like the possibilities.

I'm pretty sure this image depicts every single wvw player in existence. I never hear about anyone playing wvw or see anyone mention it. When I visited the map to get my catmander tag the one time I've ventured into wvw, I did not see another soul. I just kinda assumed it was completely dead tbh. 
---
And how would you suggest that they did it? The open world is still the open world. The whole point of the end was to make it a doom and gloom scenario and a cliffhanger, having a random scene after that (which could also potentially spoil any other character deaths that might be revealed in the next episode) would take a way quite a bit from that. 
---
Do it for her? Don't forget her? Do it for the hero? I'm not sure which one it is but I guess every one of those works

If by Endgame pve yu are talking about CMs and Raids that is.

Holo is very versatile and pretty much one of the more popular power class to bring to such content, but it is also harder to pull off, or so I heard.

Reaper is getting there slowly due to all the buffs Anet has been focusing on it every few patches, but it still suffers the same problem it always suffered : lack of consistent damage.
---
[I'm just gonna leave this here](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-it-for-her)
---
Cool!
---
It still happens even with the one outside of Thunderhead Keep.
---
I wonder if they could just disable the purple plate from dropping in the meantime while they search for a fix.  There are other rooms and plates that could use to still let you progress.  
---
Hopefully they find a fix soon, every time I'm in that map someone is raging about the Graveling.
---
I use them for mystic clovers.
---
2 a day keeps gambling at the forge, away
---
I would also shorthen the 84 second intro
---
You realize she'll be back right? 
---
I keep saying it, no one believes me. It was probably never the plan to have Aurene replace more than ONE Elder Dragon (Kralkatorrik). Obviously we know that killing a 3rd dragon would lead to Tyria collapsing because the other 3 can't do the job ... So if Aurene  just Kralkatorrik we still have 4 and if she replaces just one more ED we're down to 3 ... which won't work.
---
And this is precisely why I think that her Death (if confirmed) only changes ours plans regarding Kralkatorrik, not Jormag/Primordius/Bubbles. Which makes it possible that killing the already very weakened Kralkatorrik *in the Mists* (where, possibly, the release of his magic won't collapse Tyria) is the solution. And could be done with the help of powerful entities of the Mists (Gods, Spirits) who had to stay away while Kralky was at full power.
---
Concerning the other dragons. Jormag&amp;Primordius may be maintained in sleep forever for all we know. Bubbles could either be conveniently forgotten by Anet, or this time we actually replace him with another Dragon ... remember Kuunavang ?
---
Thank you
---
It took them 6 weeks to fix the bug that prevented completion of the Requiem armor set for a lot of players, one of the main features of the last LS episode.
---
&gt; With chunks of reality frozen in time and looping indefinitely?
---
Gonna be the fun-at-party guy. If you're talking about world bosses and/or open world maps, the "frozen in time" aspect is *game mechanic* NOT lore. Anet already tries too hard to explain pure game mechanics in lore, please don't add this one.
---
#1 is copper fed salvage I matic. 
---
This is #2 for sure
---
&gt; I feel makes it so... dissonant as you transition back to playing outside of LS. 
---
A bit, maybe. But then that's how GW2 has always worked; the locations are both geographic and temporal, i.e. the exist in a specific place *and* time.
---
Verdant Brink is the best example of this; the zone is permanently set in the day after the Pact Fleet was pulled down from the sky by Mordremoth, and the meta in the zone replays the same day/night over and over.
---
I was saying I spent so much of my time in the Largos fight giving Might (CA), fury (Storm Spirit), Vigor (Sun Spirt) and Protection (Stone Spirit), that not having to sacrifice a spirit for the Frost one had become the "druid standard" in my head - hence why I said earlier that the Druid could maintain all of theses boons
---
Most matchups are decided before the week even starts due to coverage inbalance. 
---
The easiest way to create upsets and win the match up with lower coverage is farming PPT servers until half their coverage is done playing for the week. 
---
Can't beat PPT monkas by ktraining in circles with them. It's what they love to do. But force them to fight you and suddenly every loss they lose 5 players. Funny how that works.
---
[There actually was a response yesterday, just not here on reddit.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66349/an-update-about-episode-5)
---
People will have to learn to CC on Samarog and Matthias, and many are thick-headed.
---
The door is ajar.
---
In gw2 having to play the game isn't desirable. Getting loot for the lowest amount of effort possible is preferred. 
---
Very helpful. Thanks for the info.
---
I don't think there are much more "important things" to a MUSICIAN guild than the instruments, but hey, you tried.
---
Commander Kirta, of the Iron Legion, First of her Warband, Tribune of the Legions, Leader of the Pact of the Priory, the Whispers, and the Vigil, Slayer of Zhaitan and Protector of the Realm, Initiate of the Shining Blade, Breaker of Bloodstone, Defender of Amnoon, Slayer of Balthazar, Chosen of Kormir, Slayer of Joko, the Unburnt, Breaker of Chains, and Champion of Aurene.
---
lmao that gave me a hilarious visual
---
You could read out skill activations with arcdps actually. No screenshotting necessary as it reads from game memory.
---
I missed this because the response was made outside of merged thread related to this bug.
---
rules are written in the way you never can argue with anet no matter what you do :)
---
release, collect gemstore cash and forget - this is anet since HoT
---
Don't disregard the angry Sylvari with now nothing more to lose. 
---
I was actually hoping (waaaay back in season 3) that Lazarus was actually turning good, and he might make up one of the potential substitutes.
---
That didn't really pan out how I was hoping.
---
If you fight for defended, upgraded keeps then air is harder than earth (garri).
---
Controlling lordsroom in earth despite respawns is very doable, and lets you kill the Lord while dealing with defenders. Killing air Lord with good defenders nearby is generally suicide. 
---
Luckily desert bl usually doesn't attract the best players.
---
Also, for quick questions please use general question thread
---
I think the fact that she ate Joko will suddenly become relevant.
---
Joko was a lich, and you remember the one particular thing liches tend to do, right?
---
I'm guessing you didn't see the "I am not him" video that got posted a couple of days ago, then?
---
Most jumping puzzles in GW2 is clunky, especially like the one in the volcano maps (two of the episode maps, can't rmb the name?) - requiring you to step on weird clunky and even sort of glitchy platforms? Its great for people who love it and for me, I live I too when encountering them for the first time. Like that underground one in the Metric Province - it's a joy to see them the first time.
---
But I hate puzzles. It wastes my time and just makes me fustrated. So the mounts are a plus for me.
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself :(
---
Wooooaah that male sylvari looks awesome! Can someone show me how to make one look that cool?
---
I replayed that story step recently and got treated correctly as non-human, but refered as "He" despite being a female character.
---
Seems like the code checking what gender / race you play is all voer the place for this now.
---
I wish they would make SM none upgraded and only stay as paper and it wont ever make the matchup stale on EB. But i guess that are one of those wishes that we had for years but never got heard about it so we could get that simple change.
---
So how is this supposed to work? The graveling is supposed to drop the purple plate but isn't it in the room that needs the purple plate to get in?
---
I saw the word catacombs and for a moment I thought Anet was acknowledging the existence of dungeons
---
&gt; Is it just me or does ArenaNet need to improve on making characters compelling enough to form a connection with/care about?
---
I find it interesting that you mention Trahearne as an example when many in the community didn't feel anything for his death at all. I feel that no matter what technique ANet implements, there will always be someone who doesn't feel for the death of X, especially because GW2 will remain a game where story always competes with gameplay, unlike books and movies/series. I also feel that that's okay because in real life, everyone also has different reactions when tragedy happens and that's not necessarily good or bad. Trying to get everyone to feel exactly the same would be impossible.
---
FB/REN is so close to being an alternative. I am looking forward to having a meta where you take chrono for xyz bosses and FB/Ren for abc bosses
---
Switch to DPS
---
Still waiting on those accidentals, too. Pleeease, Anet! Serve us this one rework and we will sing songs in your honor forever.
---
Is dis Kakirtog, Golden Charr, Monarch of housse kittens and officialy rich person ?
---
Well. You are correct. Holo is better.
---
If you want you can  put some cheap power gear on reaper for open world, he's quite tough.
---
Remember Eagle Runes 6th bonus doesn't affect phantasms.
---
&gt; The team is also looking into improving the experience for players who have started the Catacombs plate puzzle but have to log out
---
i may be wrong but isn't there a similar system in place..in siren's landing? 
---
i know that one isn't perfect either but at least you get to keep the "buffs" from each shrine/god upon logging..oh and they have a clearly distinct icon unlike the buggy mess with the color plates
---
You re welcome! I look forward to it and I will see if the audio is better. See ya!
---
Lots of Awakened Nightwalkers, etc guarding the thorn walls.
---
Hm, they have the same hair.
---
Can't believe what I've read. Can someone really be this stupid to rage over a crafting mistake which a supporter didn't want to restore?
---
&gt; you don't know the whole story, you know nothing.
---
Enlighten us then. Because after reading your responses and the thread, it makes you look like a monkey raging over nothing.
---
Episode was late and basic bugs like this still appear.....
---
This a big deal to a lot of us, even though it’s overall a small subset of players. There’s already been a huge decline in people playing music around Tyria - macro’d or otherwise. It’s a damn shame because it adds such an amazing touch to this game and has become quite the community. I really hope Anet saves this. 
---
this is fire!!
---
It would be double Healing Renegades (tanks) and two Condi Zeal FBs. With Lasting Legacy and Salvation the Renegades can be your healers, provide 25 might, and do perma alacrity. While you lose Sun Spirit and Spotter you gain Soulcleave and Assassin's Presence. Most importantly it enables you to run a Firebrand.
---
The Firebrand is a decent increase over the Chroni and with the Zeal traitline + SoJ (eternal armory) you can upkeep 25 vuln on the boss for a minor dps loss. The CC is plentiful, boons are decent, damage is comparable, and you are sturdy as all hell with a Heal Ren instead of a Druid (and all the aegis from FB)
---
I can't decide between Ranger and Elementalist (Weaver)
---
I have full power accessories so will be playing power only.
---
I like PvE only (raids/fractals/open world)
---
I have a power ascended greatsword and a power ascended longbow.
---
I typically play mages in mmorpgs but I have heard weaver is complex and not great for open world content. However ranger also has pets which I don't normally like but I can get past that.
---
I am not new to the game but coming back from a break (level 104 mastery).
---
What do you suggest to me please?
---
You do not have to go in to that room at all to get the poi in there. I don't get why people still suggest this. It was fixed several day ago and i got it outside with several characters. I just got it now with one today. Just walk up to the gate and you will get it. I noticed you can not be on a mount though so make sure you get off it and the poi is yours.
---
r/Blessed_Images
---
Are this both player characters? Looks great!
---
The really great thing about this game is that there are SO many varied ways to enjoy it. You might not like music, but anet took the time and care to develop instruments and we like to play them. It’s important shit to us. 
---
Griffon races are about the only adventures I don't hate. It's a shame there aren't any on this map since all the verticality would have made it the ideal terrain for them.
---
so i dont know why you are arguing
---
But it's 4 elder dragons.
---
Zhaitan, Mordy, Primordus and Jormag.
---
Karlk and bubbleS still have their energy.
---
It's easy for bugs like these to slip past testing because they don't have hundreds of people testing the maps and this is the kind of issue that only manifest itself when a lot of people do the same thing at the same time. 
---
That's still under your control.
---
GM whispers have an UI sound, so you can also enable GW2 sound in the background just in case. 
---
ANet has made the rules to be as lenient as possible with those who are not actually AFK, but those who walk on the edge will always have the risk of falling.
---
At this point, every new balance patch is kind of a chrono 'suicide watch' meme because of constant re-gearing. 
---
But as others have said, the previous build is still fine. Relax, learn the rotations, embrace the chrono jail :)
---
Yes this are our player characters. :) Thank you.
---
Wrong room. They fixed the green POI, not the purple one.
---
He was a norn firebrand

You are completely wrong from A to Z. In case you didn't understood, english is not my mother tongue, so take your arguments around that and drop them.  
---
You think throwing hours of gameplay is bad, but the fact is I have hours of good memories of GW, I just left and make sure I won't return in any way. I would do the same in any store where the customer support is so bad I won't buy anything forever. That's all. The past is the past, not being able to move on is death. When you read a book, you spend hours for what ? just memories, thinking, knowledge, ... Guildwars is the same for me : an adventure finished, I move on. It happens because I just realized the support didn't care about me. I won't spend more euros on this game. Period.

I was a very bad casual back in the day and never really did dungeons so I don’t know Eir outside of the main story. In fact I have only done four dungeons but I can’t say which ones, I don’t remember any of it. It’s a part of the game I never thought I was good enough to do - I got scolded once by someone for not having the right weapon equipped and just felt like I wasn’t allowed to do dungeons because I just wanted to do them for fun/story. Nowadays I’m raiding but I always think about dungeons but I’m still scared to try them. 
---
For me, Trahearne felt like he was on some epic quest, as some Sylvari are, but I was just a stepping stone for him, some cog in the machine he was building but only he knew what it was, why it was important and how it was meant to be built. Kinda like the Trahearne Show and I was just along for the ride. 
---
I do heavily agree on the whole bringing back dead characters cheapening their death part. Death in stories can be a driving force or it can move story/development forward. It can bring a lot of meaning to the game, especially if it’s a character you’ve grown fond of. For example, Marjory’s sister passing didn’t really affect me, but I really like Marjory and felt really bad for her but it lead to some character development which was cool. Kasmeer was a bit boring/flat for me until PoF. Also in the case of sacrifice - it makes the sacrifice not seem as selfless? Especially if them coming back to life is expected (like people are saying with Aurene - I don’t really know how she died yet though) it definitely cheapens it! 
---
I do not see how having a plate with a distinct color on your back is a "buggy mess"?
---
[Also keep this in mind.](https://xkcd.com/936/)
---
That's why we should have user adjustable presets and not just "best/worst" 
---
It's be great to have at least 3 user preset that we could customize. The amount of time lost in my life because I'm constantly monkeying with the video settings as a WvW / multibox player. smh
---
I mean if we for a second come back to the Silvary - There is another Dragon Champion freed. I wonder all the time why we are not going to the mother tree and ask it if it could try to absorb at leat Mordremoth magic.
---
In a hybrid or full Fire Brigade set up, who would be best outfitted to tank? 
---
I have seen many arguments either way for the Fire brigade side of thing (renegade is lowest dps so it tanks, or firebrand has more blocks so it's better equipped to tank, that sort of stuff). Currently we're all used to Chrono tanks and out of Chrono/Druid it is the best equipped to tank yet has higher DPS, so I will follow off that logic and assume that as Firebrand has more access to blocks and aegis it is the better tank. 
---
I would say in terms of casually, FB makes probably the best tank. Not only is it practically invincible, when tanking the FB faces the group allowing for extremely consistent mantra buffs. That isn't to say heal Renegade can't tank either (which it can and is very effective at doing so), but if you are bringing a second Healer on a tanking encounter I believe a Minstrel FB is going to be the best bang for your buck for more casual groups.
---
To clarify further, its just not that good outside of combat (being that with swiftness you're just 9u/s faster with the rune compared to without) but its actually a world of difference in combat.
---
Since very little classes have access to Superspeed (or rather, in cases like World vs World very little classes have access to Superspeed *and* is willing to blow that to chase someone down) that you could honesty just outrun whatever was chasing you (or abuse mobility skills like leaps, teleports, shadowsteps, blinks, etc). For roaming I can't say but in a blobfight where you're mostly in combat that extra 71u/s over basic swiftness can position you more favorably for your bombs.
---
On the PvE side of things its honestly pretty good for "forced combat" situations or "I wanna get the fuck out of combat so I can mount back up" ones, for example Dragon's Stand's Blighting Tree phases, with the poison constantly applying a DOT that keeps you at combat movement speed hauling ass to the next preserver has you abusing mobility skills fairly often (especially if you're a class that either lacks a passive 25% movement boost, lacks self swiftness, or a mix of both either lacking both or you forgot to trait/equip the skills/weapons to do so).
---
From a world comp standpoint I've abused this rune with a lot of the alts that I plan for core world comp (since there's that one piss ass annoying heart in Blazeridge where you have to stealth around Ash Legion, the swiftness duration *and* bonus speed really makes the heart easy from pre-stacking swiftness before talking to the NPC).
---
I'm more concerned that the frame rate is running unthrottled as it's a complete waste of energy and wear on the system. It's more important to keep the FPS synced as a square of the monitors refresh rate to ensure every frame is resolved. He should set the limiter to 30.
---
Thanks so much :D Glad the necro vibe came across! 
---
We called NE tower Helms Deep cos it was so hard to take.
---
 You could build ballistas and ACs on the upper platoe to shoot on the door but most of all the siege were always there.
---
Cata spot (garri side) could be trebbed from Garri and that's very poor positionally if defender can nuke from the wall during a defence push.
---
But it's not the walls/gate that are the real hard part.
---
It's the inner layout. First courtyard is completely surrounded by walls that can be used by ranged, defence point #1. Then you pull back to top of the ramp for defence point #2, enemies choking up the ramp into a kill zone and possible siege from upper platoe can hit here and also that caster zone down lord/ at supplydepo. Then defence point #3 the bridge with a nice high ground for defenders to reach far. And that corner/last ramp to upper platoe is its own hurdle for defence point #5. And nowadays glide in safely from spawn on the top platoe for defence point #6.
---
[It's sitting one of these vertical mounts.](https://mnpctech.com/case-mods-gaming-pc-liquid-modding-custom-computer-mnpctech-overclock-cooling-fan-grills/mnpctech-black-stage-1-vertical-video-card-gpu-mounting-bracket.html) The cable plugs into the bottom as usual.
---
It would be weird how they'd transition to the next chapter though. I guess it'd be "go to this location and continue previous story's scene"?
---
That's what someone who's trying to keep an elder dragon from regaining self awareness would say.
---

Many humans think they're women/men/dogs/horses/... these days, I understand the npc's confusion !

You may want to put a \ before your hashtags on reddit. You were trying to be all "#1 is this" but you ended up with GIANT TEXT instead.
---
Isn't LL only two weeks, and then you need to re-purchase?
---
GW2 treats everyone as an adult. You have to set yourself goals and then work towards them.
---
For example, my first goal was getting ascended for my two wvw characters (back in 2013/14). After that I wanted one ascended equipment for my ele because it was my fractal main.
---
Then I wanted 30k ap for the light leggings.
---
After that HoT and raids released and ever since then Im nearly daily raiding with friends or pugs. But I still set myself goals, like Envoys Herald title. All legendary collections. Finishing last Champion titles. Escorting Dolyaks ;p
---
I started playing 5 days ago and i had to buy the light fire armor from the shop.  I just wish i could infinitely change my appearance since im level 40 and constantly upgrading gear.  Is there an easy way to get the transformation things?

1) If you're free to play, you can't use map chat, no. In the starter zones you will often see people in map chat advertise that they're offering help to newbies, mentor them around, show them stuff. You can pm them as long as they're on the same map as you and join their party. Once you're level 10 you can go to the racial cities and they usually have hang out spots there, if you find a cluster of people you can talk in local chat and maybe someone will give you a hand. The forums require a full account in order to post there. Feel free to keep asking questions here on reddit in the Q&amp;A thread if you don't find a group of people to hang with. There's also the reddit discord if you have little questions. The player run wiki is also an immense treasure trove of info! 
---
2) You don't have to quest, no. I mean, we don't have quests as such, hearts are generally there for a "stuff around this area is X level" marker, but the events, or even just exploring around will net you XP. Don't forget to buy some gathering tools from a merchant as well, you'll get some ok XP from this without thinking about it. Dungeons start at level 30, and while not as many people do them anymore, you'll still find people. It may be difficult to get a low level group together, as people often want max level characters in their dungeon groups (you get downscaled, but have all your traits and skills, etc). It sounds like you could benefit from a newbie friendly guild to take you around places and show you the ropes. Check out /r/guildrecruitment or have a browse on the forums. You may not be able to post there, but you can still read and contact people, or just keep an eye out in game for guild spam and message someone that looks interesting. The thing that keeps people playing this game is other people, so make friends, find a guild, you'll have a way better time :) 
---
3) Item upgrades will generally come from the trading post or you can craft your own runes and sigils. You may be limited to certain things on the trading post, so you might not be able to buy exactly what you want. Or just survive on whatever drops you get. On the road to 80 you'll forever be finding things that are a slight upgrade, just keep on equipping them. :) 
---
How exactly do you get that ammount of gold by doing Istan? you open the phylacteries  and salvage it and sell the ressources?
---
I got all of the POI in the map without using any plate to go into a room. I don't know why so many people think you can't 
---
Did you do the story on that character?
---
i play an asura so i did not know this was an issue. Still i think this is mostly a joke
---
Heck yeah. Balthazar is like one of my favorite characters of GW2 and his horned helm plus the eye color is just sick. ANet made him a bit flat but I think he's just a testament to how much some people prefer blank canvases.
---
They also have tech in the game that lets them update a bunch of stuff in game without an update such as merchant items, values etc so even if the gem store was build as a native part of the game they could update it.
---
I wanna try this! Are these scheduled for certain times? I'm new sorry for the dumb question
---
Your situation sounds a little unique in that you wouldn't even have enough time to complete a living world chapter.

Cavalier equipment+durability runes works really well. Replace the sigil of concentration with a sigil of bounty, and if you're feeling saucy, replace the sigil of night with a sigil of blood. Mix in a few zerker trinkets if you want 100% crit with retal and fury up.
---
Also, 99% of shoulderpads on charr actually use Asuran tech to keep them suspended in the air, ridiculously far from your character’s model -.-
---
The trivia section at the bottom of [this page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists) gives a decent overview of what's happened in the past.
---
You might be waiting in the wrong place. If the gates of Arah are controlled by the pact, then the meta event is complete and nothing more will happen at Compass Plaza. Instead, the defense event will keep happening at the gates until it fails. Go wait there and hope the high wizard spawns with the next one.

lol &amp; it's still worth more than my account...
---
The dps increase would probably be a lot less than I had initially anticipated (&lt;3k) since you have to have high bd as the single Chrono anyway.
---
You are giving up on 10 man SoI and 5 man Aegis for a small golem dps increase on Tank Chrono which won't really translate 100% in a real raid environment. I would never bother with that to be honest.

His 1 and 4 are still borderline useless is what I last read about it in alliance chat, but don't quote me on that.

Also u sure this is the right subreddit?

Elementalist isn't overly difficult to setup for leveling.  Staff is pretty bland so I'll talk about fresh air Scepter/Dagger.  Fresh Air is a grandmaster in the air specialization that refreshes your air attunement whenever you critically strike in another attunement.  It's basically like playing Zeus as a GW2 Elementalist.  
---
You'd presumably grab the air specialization at level 21, the fire at level 45 and the arcane at level 71.  [Something like this.](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJArYhUMophlNwnB8RMIAY1boNkGkL5FoGGBgCwBA-jxRGABgs/QCnAApUCSmeAAV/ZIlfA8AAAA-e) Runes/Sigils: anything power-based should work.  You have a fair number of blast finishers at your disposal so might duration at level 45 and higher.  You can get a little more offensive with it as you become comfortable with the playstyle.  Off-hand focus is the defensive weapon vs. off-hand Dagger. 
---
Your "rotation" would revolve around "Electric Discharge" the grandmaster **minor** trait.  What this does is zap enemies nearby when you attune to air.  Thus your rotation revolves around using skills like air auto-attacks, lightning strike and blinding flash then jumping into fire attunement casting Dragon's Tooth (delayed), Ring of Fire (Fire Field) and Phoenix.  One of these should critically strike later on which lets you repeat the cycle.  You can add Earthquake, Churning Earth and Arcane Brilliance (Heal) as blast finishers to that fire field later on since you'll be swapping back into air soon anyway.  
---
If you want to play Staff for open world meta's and the like that's fine, but it's pretty much just lava fonts and meteor showers.  I find fresh air Scepter/Dagger or Dagger/Dagger more interesting for exploration, normal/veteran mobs and the like.  Open with Glyph of Storms in Earth (Blind for multiple mobs) in Air for Damage/Vulnerability (strong against larger monsters) and Fire for a balanced damage storm with a slightly lower cooldown.   You basically just spam damage skills and cycle back to air to zap stuff.  It's pretty fun in my opinion, but it's a little more work than just mindlessly spamming lava font and meteor shower.

Nobody needs to change your mind because objectively it is worse. But if you enjoy it more then it's subjective and there's nothing to change. Fractal entrance and vendors, free ports across tyria, return to location, and port to raids all at the sanctuary.

All because of GOATs :\\ lmao Also, that Reaper buff is crazy strong...
---
Okay, so the meta event isn't complete. If it's actually stalled you may have to wait for a patch to get a new map instance. According to the wiki, the only other thing you can try is luring a champ over and allowing it to drain the morale. 
---
I've been getting lots of lag spikes these past few days, but it seems to only happen when there's a lot going on on the screen. The chatbox gets updated, but screen animations don't and suddenly I'll be dead. It happens on AB meta, TT meta, Thunderhead metas, and T4 fractals, sometimes in dungeons, and never when I'm solo. Was wondering if it was because I live in the northeast US and we're about to get a snowstorm, but I think there's a relationship to what my computer renders. But it rubberbands everything which seems like it would be more taxing for my computer than displaying it all normally. Any way I can fix whatever's going on?
---
Thanks for the detailed post! I guess I'm just super excited to play my class in a group. There's many support options but nobody to play with! I'll look for a guild, I see I am able to join guild chat at least.
---
Sorry then, it sounded a lot like the usual "trash all elitists" comment and it triggered me to overreact.

Why is mimicing the action well a problem? There's no need for them to take Well of Recall with an alacrity ren in the squad.

&gt; That and Taimi's robot Scruffy sacrificing himself against AI/computer programming to open a door they needed mid HoT.
---
See, I didn't really connect with that at all. I just felt bad that Taimi was going to be inconvenienced by it. Scruffy doesn't talk and his sentience was never established beyond that moment of hesitation. 
---
Even then, you could argue that was just due to conflicting directives. His main function is to protect and serve Taimi, which he can't do if he's in ten pieces.
---
With that said, I wasn't strongly impacted by Aurene's death. I'm (probably too) confident that they're going to bring her back in some form. In stories with Guild Wars 2's tone, death is a usually more of a tool for character development than whatever you'd call the way GRRM uses it. Maybe you'll be more interested in how her return is going to affect her as a character. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/ might be what you are looking for.
---
Yep. It might take you some time but with raids and fractals you'll have all the resources you need. Have fun!
---
Only "5hr per day"? Not hard core enough. /s
---
I really liked Aurene and Blish, those two were my favourite NPCs, sucks to be me. Blish's wit was absolutely tremendous... that "trees can't move" line stays with me to this day.

You can‘t send a craften pre to your other account, because they are accountbound on craft. But you can send a dropped one or buy one.

Fair enough I have limited mtx but copper fed and watchwork mining pick were the two I had so it looks like I shouldn't regret this pick-up 
---
I really like the look of it, and i use Weaver, chrono, Warrior, wich all uses sword. It’s more a question of time
---
I need to work bro 😂

Too soon.
---
No it's been 6 years!!
---
I can't really say that I had an emotional response to her death in the typical sense. Like, I wasn't crying over her statue. But I was definitely emotional during the fight, similar to how I felt during the final phase of Balthazar's fight where the music is swelling and we start to realize we're going to kill a god. "You're not getting away from me" or whatever the line was perfectly encapsulated how I felt during that fight: aggressive and vindictive. And then the ending was more of a release of that emotion.
---
Congrats!
---
Damage over Time for her. Get those condi bombs out.
---
In regards to Chrono, is running nearly full berserker + Pack runes really more worth it than nearly full Diviner + Scholar runes? In a situation where, say, you have 2 druids so fury and such are covered.
---
It was the rabbit ears who were missing for a long time, not the cat ones :)

What the other guy said + you kinda want to finish it within a certain time frame for the map buff

Shit! I forgot to change the text saing that sword and greatsword will get an explenation how they will work within the burst-stance system. So ot will be explained in part 2.

Population calculations are done on mondays, so pay attention to the server state. I'm not about exact time, but you can take a screenshot and see if someone changes, it will only change once.
---
Alternatively, transfer to Aurora Glade, it's currently linked with Deso so you can play wvw together (until the end of February at least).
---
It's a good go-to response!

And you do not even have enough space to mount

I still have that thumb. Would have like that as well.

I agree. Taimi's bow could be given back as well, so I don't see why the thumb couldn't.

Reshade can kill the fps, depending what settings it's using.

Good. That is what I wanted you to see :) The horn that is. Not the underwear. They were just a added bonus.

---
Once on monday, so pay attention to other servers as well to be sure that the change happened. There's big chance that deso wont see a population drop because it became full last week.
---
&gt; only 5h per day
---
That's more than enough time to go for a legendary.
---
Do you like the weapon?
---
You have a goal in the game, a thing that many of us are missing.
---
He didn't eat Aurene though. Pretty sure that will be a plot point.
---
I just want my Aurensey back :( 
---
Yup, QED.
---
I went for that as my first legendary because I loved the precursors and thought what-the-hell. I kinda regret it because I rarely use it. Also the draw/stow sounds are really annoying imo. 
---
&gt; pretty much showing that stuff is becoming way too predictable
---
Tbh, is there a problem with that? If the story is good, the presentation is good, it doesn't matter if it's predictable. Most storylines are predictable in any work of fiction. What entertains us how it is presented.
---
I saw the weekly thread afterward...sorry for not following protocol!  Thanks for being polite about it!
---
oops
---
Thanks, Inquest! Thanks, Scarlet! This is the best fractal ever!

---
Yes. I need this now. I need to divebomb kralk as a living weapon person. Or even better, i want the option to make my sylvari character be turned IN to a spear, just one giant spear. Just put a metal cone on his head and he'll be good to go :D
---
Doesnt help with the presentation of her.  But I guess there's lore behind it so that makes sense.  Youd think they wouldnt make them look 8 years old.  But anime.  
---
I won't give up my thumb! D:
---
For the moment I can pop it on a subdomain.
---
Currently on my gw2 stuff I am spending ~11/m on servers, a cheap 2.5 eur frontend one and a 8 eur backend one so I shouldn't have issues running it, processing power wise anyways.    
---
I would love to say I could delevop it further but I am not (yet) a php dev so it would currently be just keeping it alive and up and running, not ideal but it would mean yer work wont have died.
---
It is my first time dealing with symfony, anything I aught to look out for?  
---
The root file, is that ``web/app.php``?  
---
Did you use apache or nginx or something else?
---
Lol, right?
---
Only if you have LW season 3 unlocked
---
imagine if thats the joke
---
condi scourge LUL did you read patch last 6 month ?
---
That argument is completely nonsensical, as the game is an MMORPG, and not a music simulator. 
---
Otherwise I could make the argument "I have a guild where we climb on trees from all of Tyria, which is the most important thing to us, therefore ArenaNet should make more more tree climbing content and provide more support to us."
---
plz can you respect yourself and your class ?
---
I had the same legendary dilemma and gave up the journey right at the beginning several times because I got too excited and anxious about it, I wanted to get it as soon as possible.
---
When I decided to consider it a long term goal, do other stuff and slowly gather the time gated materials and clovers, I finally did it.
---
Repeated the process twice and now I have Nevermore and Twilight. It took me basically 3 months each, you just need to have patience.
---
You'd probably go faster cuz I only did T4s and WvW, and raids give a lot more gold.
---
I also want The Shining Blade to be my next one, it's amazing. Go for it! 
---
Good luck! 
---
Id say go full plaguedoctor cause it is amazig for heal cdps boon duration and gives you some sustain as well.
---
Why now suddenly though when we also met him in PoF in-between these two events already?
---
Congrats man! I've been trying to convince myself to get this finally done for several years, but honestly it's just so daunting to think about finishing the ENTIRE map. Some of those heart NPC's can be really challenging too.
---
I remember one time I was trying to do get my dailies done, and I was a few hours in, and I accidentally triggered one of those wurms in Queensdale, and it practically one shot me! I've been scared to go back since 😂
---
Anyways nice job, hope you felt awesome after finishing this, maybe one day I'll be able to do it too :) 
---
I hosted it behind apache and pointing the virtualhost on `/the/path/web/`
---
To install, you need composer ("package manager" for php [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
---
You need a php7.0+ environment, a mysql server to store keys / codes, a mongodb server to store the gw2 api informations and cached requests (needs several GB of storage).
---
Just go to `/the/path` and type `composer install` to install php dependancies.
---
You may have to change a few config parameters into `/the/path/app/config/config.yml`
---
You need to schedule a cron to retrieve/cache api data (items, ...). I scheduled mine every 15 min.
---
If you want gw2skills links to work, you will have to contact gw2skills administrator to whitelist your IP in his api.

Renacrity

I think it's less about being oversized and more about being badly placed on the model. So many shoulders just float 2 feet up off your character especially when you're non-human that it's just ugly. Add that to the fact that they *are* oversized and it's just horrible.
---
1) I crafted Twilight 6 months ago and I'm coming back to the game now. Just found out legendaries can now freely swap sigils. Back then, my plan was to craft Eternity and sell the legendary to craft another legendary. Is it still worth doing? should I keep the twilight and not go through the effort to craft sunrise just to sell it? What would you do?
---
2) I can't decide between The Flameseeker Prophecies and Shoshadoo. Which one is the hardest to craft, the prettier, and your personal preferences? 
---
Thanks 
---
No you can\`t. 
---
Completely agree. But this guy said they were struggling to survive on necro, so maybe they should continue with necro and learn how to avoid attacks with the added buffer of extra health + shroud before trying the active defense classes like Thief/Mesmer/Ele/whatever
---
The game gets small updates quite a bit so things like new items are just added in the updates.  Things like pricing is likely just server side adjustments.
---
No worries mate, you can either statswap ypur armor or just play with the armor you have rn. New stats are hust for a bit more dps and since its not your main job to do dmg you're fine
---
[Guess that's a bug then](https://imgur.com/a/8wOrWiX)
---
Are you asking about central Tyria mastery points, or HoT, or PoF ones?
---
That's the opposite of a problem. I love the asymmetrical shoulders. Not many games have them in abundance like gw2.
---
Epidemic is shit on all power build after nerf.
---
Based on their wording, I assume Central Tyria.
---
For some it simply never clicked. WoodenPotatoes also keeps mentioning how he does not and has not ever cared about Aurene, Taimi, and most of GW2's character arcs in general. 
---
But for many players it worked, and for most of the studio devs as well, because otherwise they wouldn't have released it. 
---
Thanks for the insight, I knew some nerds (which I say with the upmost love, and as one myself) would have the hookup on the lore &lt;3
---
Maybe because the Thunderhead team is more or less the same one that worked on Rising Flames. 
---
No problems here.
---
Get the options menu open and watch your ping. See if that's spiking. Mine has been recently too but I've just switched ISPs so I thought it was that. Also in the northeast.
---
I want a dragon fight scenario where they dont use the "death of ally" and the "build a big boi weapon to defeat dragon" scenarios. There must be some other way to defeat a dragon. 
---
You must be talking about meta defenders, lol.  While I agree with your defense strategy, I have rarely seen defenders last long enough to keep falling back to #6 and eventually winning the fight unless it's a 5v5 at most.  If by your defence #2 the defenders haven't stopped the attackers it's usually done for if the groups are of any size, with higher up siege being the only possible savior. if an attacking group can push past a defender group at #2, its usually a route.
---
The part is actually the packet reading part. AFAIK that's how ArcDPS does it.
---
But that doesn't determine things like what slot your skills are in so they can be lit up properly.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey
---
**Hero's journey**
---
In narratology and comparative mythology, the monomyth, or the hero's journey, is the common template of a broad category of tales that involve a hero who goes on an adventure, and in a decisive crisis wins a victory, and then comes home changed or transformed.The study of hero myth narratives started in 1871 with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's observations of common patterns in plots of heroes' journeys. Later on, others introduced various theories on hero myth narratives such as Otto Rank and his Freudian psychoanalytic approach to myth, Lord Raglan's unification of myth and rituals, and eventually hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung's view of myth. In his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell described the basic narrative pattern as follows:
---
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
---
Campbell and other scholars, such as Erich Neumann, describe narratives of Gautama Buddha, Moses, and Christ in terms of the monomyth.

It's weird, when I was younger I *hated* asymmetry, but now that I'm older, I prefer symmetrical asymmetry, like one shoulder so long as I can match that to gloves that have one glove, that match the colours of my chest... etc

Makes my char more interesting to look at
---
Any class you pick, you need to play with the other. So you need knowledge of both essentially. 
---

---
It's probably something new. When the map came to us everything was ok. I have it done 100% complete months ago.
---
Not sure what Thunderhead Peaks has anything to do with this post as it's about Domain of Kourna.
---
Whisper's Pistol I think
---
There isn't a maximum value for stats per se, but there is a point at which those stats no longer add as much as other stats will.  For instance, if you have 100% crit rate through gear and traits, adding more precision will not increase your damage output at all.  Same for boon duration and condition duration, 100% is the maximum.
---
Stats that can be better optimized would be power and ferocity.  while you would think that going from 280% crit damage to 300% crit damage is better than adding 200 power, it's more dependent on how much power you have to start with. [https://gw2power.com/](https://gw2power.com/) is a great tool to check your effective power level and decide whether adding ferocity or power is going to increase your damage to a greater extent
---
while toughness and vitality have no effective caps, you should only use as much of each as required to survive.  remember, dead enemies deal no damage so the faster you kill the better your defense is
---
Everything is uncapped EXCEPT:
---
Boon and condition duration: 100% (at level 80, every 15 points in concentration / expertise boost it by 1%)
---
Crit chance: 100% (at level 80, every 21 precision above 1000 gives 1%, and you start with 5%)
---
There are traits and effects that might make you overcap these, which is wasting stat points. For instance, having 80% boon duration from concentration is a waste if you have traits or buffs giving you 33% more.
---
I agree with premise of the title. I loved this episode for having us fail and I want us to fail worse next episode. It upset me only one character died this episode. I don't agree with destroying Lion's Arch because well its been done. I do think next episode more main characters need to die and our army gets massacred this will make Kralkatorrik a bigger threat than Mordremoth and Zhiatan and will show we need to fight him more tactfully.
---
They needed to give Aurene a voice much sooner. Her mother and brother could talk to minds, why not her? We needed more then chirps, honestly. It also upsets me they never updated that teleport to the egg chamber thing. I really wanted to feel for this character but I'm just filled with dread for the world.
---
Check out the racing scarf
---
For group play there's also unique buffs coming from other players:
---
- Spotter (+Precision)
---
- Assassin's Presence (+Ferocity)
---
- Empower Allies (+Power)
---
- Pinpoint Distribution (+Condition Damage)
---
The thing is, if you want us to fail hard, (which is exactly what happened with Mordremoth and the Pact, but everyone seems to forget it) then our victory won't rely on a realistic, tangible solution, but on a plot-twist (once again, Mordremoth's battle).
---
If we kill everyone, then we're all alone, but of course we'll need to win sooner or later. And I doubt anyone on this sub would like to see the Commander win all by himself against an Elder Dragon thanks to some new info we got at the last minute...
---
so you want Cataclysm...
---
No I get thats your opinion and I accept that but if Anet has us lose then next episode we kill Kralkatorrik that would be stupid. Kralkatorrik has the powers of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar as well as his own if we just kill him that would be horrible. He needs to be a bigger threat.
---
Yep!
---
If a music guild does play the game like a music simulator, then what is more important to them than said music? 
---
I never said Anet should only work on instruments. I would support it, just like I support them making any type of content. Not sure what made you think that.
---
I believe it's also affecting the macro community. A really nice songs people wrote are broken and no longer play correctly because the octaves get messed up.
---
And if you just use "he", "his", "him" etc. people will know what you mean

You get chest, leggins and boots from purchasing GW Eye of the North, Factions and Nightfall. For the rest [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/iu3qw/a_hom_guide_to_3050_aimed_at_beginners/) estimates that a couple of hours.
---
You could wait for the process to go through. It may be out of your bank but that doesn't mean its been processed. Be patient if its not there by Monday/Tuesday send a ticket to Arenanet. Why did you think you'd get them straight away without Anet having to verify stuff. Also take into account its the weekend banks can be closed and Anet aren't really known for working on the weekend.
---
Right... That's irrelevant though. You act like a PHP dev.  You are a PHP dev. Don't be a PHP dev.
---
For context, there's nothing wrong with moving on from a company you disagree with because their support and you had a bad time.  It's the way it was done. 
---
Looking through this thread alone, you mention moving on from a company because "I will leave if you continue to make shit".  Again, a valid reason, but it's how it's done and the attitude behind it that is the telling part.
---
I mean, I wish you the best and you did great with the tool. It's open and on github, so anyone can pick it up if they so choose, but the attitude and the way you describe makes you sound like a fairly cancerous dev to work with and I've worked with and managed my fair share.
---
"You don't know how much languages I can play with" is as telling as it is.  What's next, bragging about your leetcode ranking? :) 
---
Any other alternate weapon shown in the parentheses. (S/D ) means sword + dagger,
---
Probably about 10 to 15 hours if you just rushed it. The necessary points are actually really quick, you just need to get far enough to "use" them on the GW1 end.
---
You'd also be spending about $60, so it's not quite worth it if you're just doing it for the armor.
---
&gt;I can't decide between The Flameseeker Prophecies and Shoshadoo. Which one is the hardest to craft
---
Crafting FSP costs 1,4k gold, shoshadoo costs 2,5k.
---
Are you really going to let this ruffle your feathers? Come on...it's a joke. You getting mad makes it ironic

I know I'm being irritable and irrational.  I fully realize that a live environment is entirely different from a testing environment and there are more more variables in play here.  I don't believe that the customer (or player, for that matter) is always right.  However, blowing off almost any steam against this company is like having a discussion with a wall.  I really wish we could have had a short episode AMA where ArenaNet at least acknowledged they were looking into the issue rather than a week later. 
---
They usually take ages for anti fraud. In any case open a ticket and they'll get back to you.
---
It's pretty hard to say if this would work since there are some important informations missing. Like how to stances work for other weapon? Is the trait line better than discipline/spellbreaker? The spear on the other hand seems promising. First have two questions about about the high stance 2 and 3 skills. Do they lock you in place while channelling? And why doesn't work the 2 work like the greatsword 5? You could make it a channelled charge where you do a strong thrust at the end that does more damage the longer the charge. Also the "insta kill" on the 5 seems to strong especially if your in low stance for the instant cast. It worked for daredevil because it was a elite and you could stun break to get away. I would remove the "insta kill" and just leave it as a high damage skill. For the hit box mechanic just make a minor trait that gives you % extra damage if you're between 130 (normal melee range) and 200? Away from your enemy. I hope this helps and I look forward to your next post.
---
So sweet moral and sweat wisdom ... please more ...
---
The Flameseeker Prophecies became so much prettier right now! Thanks! 
---
That's downplaying it. The entire Pact fleet got shot down over the jungle, hundreds, probably thousands, died or were turned. It was grim and a heavy blow, even if it did not happen in Core Tyria. 
---
And I want them to finally kill of Taimi so she can stop being a bandaid solution for every problem that comes up. We all cant get what we want though. 
---
How the fuck could the game continue if they destroy Tyria? Next season/expansion takes place in the Mists? And then what of the consequences of having destroyed Tyria?
---
&gt; For the moment, for me, the Commander is just the typical main character who believes he / she can face any villain and kill it,
---
Except that is NOT true. When fighting Joko, the Commander did NOT believe they could kill Joko, they were hopeful that it was another Joko fabrication. 
---
When fighting Mordremoth they weren't sure they could kill him, only that they had to.
---
When going up against Balthazar they weren't sure of it either. They had to find a way and it DID lead to their own death.
---
&gt; the Commander kills a villain and already has a plan under his / her sleeve to kill the next villain
---
Name one time in which we already had plans on HOW to kill the next villain long before the climax of that arc. 
---
Zhaitan doesn't count and we never figured that one out.
---
Scarlet was a normal person, doesn't count. Not to mention that it took her to destroy an entire city before we even got close enough.
---
The plan on how to kill Mordremoth wasn't figured out until the literal end.
---
Balthazar wasn't figured out until after an entire season and expansion and there wasn't that much to figure out either. Gods don't have unique, respective weaknesses unlike Elder Dragons. 
---
Joko was a "I really hope his immortality is another lie because I got nothing." 
---
And we knew Kralkatorrik's weakness for a really long time now. From way before the game even started and it was communicated to the Commander during the events of Path of Fire, who's arc started in season 2. Aurene's importance as a weakness to Kralkatorrik was heavily implied many times before its confirmation in Path of Fire.
---
No villain, as of yet, post Kralk. So I find it really hard to imagine that we already have those plans laid out.
---
Your argument is weak and baseless.
---
Also what armor is that? 
---
I don't think tactful means what you think it means. 
---
Not much of a secret now is it :P
---
Dude, take it easy.
---
calm your tits m8, you make it sound like i said some racial slurs or something.
---
With how the Kralkatorrik threat was more of a sidelines thing for most of the expansion and a huge part of this season, I think a few more episodes of next season focusing on Kralk won't hurt. 
---
Thank you!
---
AH, THE RELIQUARY OF THE KING'S GUARD. THERE'S A SCEPTER HERE.
---
i like how 10 and 11 basically look like 10 and 11 (1&lt;&gt;, \\\\)
---
GW2 is like any other MMORPG - give it a time, be patient and eventualy you will love it.
---
I'm a WoW player too and I friggin love GW2.
---
Whoever says "this mmo is shit" after FEW hours of gameplay, without even seeing end game - is simply dumb person. 
---
Hes right too especially since a big part of the story is showing the Commander slowly getting worn down down and coming off exhausted. Hell the last living story ends with them stating they have no idea what to do 
---
Well we have gotten a fractal every second release and they said they hope to release a wing every second release as well so one release is a fractal the next a raid. If they can't do this they can't do it.
---
Username checks out 
---
This is happening to me too!
---
I have no idea. I personally like somewhat "historically acurate" armors and weapons. :O   
---
But sometimes I think I'm alone with this. 80% of all GW2 characters look like infusion cancer.
---
We're both bad at the internet then ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Yep. Did not know. Thank you
---
NSFW?
---
I am actually surprised they still haven't made them weapons even if they're found as early as base game, but have tons of bottles and mugs as weapons.
---
I wasn't commenting specifically on orphea, don't think we really know her exact backstory/age, more just the general trope of anime to give their lolis higher supposed ages so they aren't blatently kiddie porn (which might even be illegal otherwise).
---
You're not alone. I've always felt like they were trying to push Aurene as the new GW2 "mascot" and a character we should care about, but it never clicked with me on a personal level. I was relieved when she was gone because it meant the game would no longer try to convince me I should deeply care about her. Although I fully expect her to come back as a deus ex machina at some point. I did not hate her or anything like that, I just didn't feel as deeply about her character as the game wanted me to.
---
Dont tell me you can look on that without trauma?

Why desolace
---
I love historically accurate armor in games but the sad fact is that such armor is basic and bland. Which is intentionally done since engravings could catch blades more easily or weaken areas for punctures and dents.
---
And there won't be feminine variations because women simply didn't fight often enough for variations to become commonplace in history.
---
But in a fantasy setting, magic really negates the need to be so focused on reduction weakpoints to bladed and blunt weapons, since a fireball will be far more common in comparison. And most fantasy settings will have women fighting almost as often so variations will become commonplace.
---
So "historically accurate" armor, incidentally, wouldn't be accurate in fantasy settings of magic and female fighters.
---
Not to say bikini armors would though. But armor that curves to show boob shapes probably would be, despite many people I see arguing otherwise.
---
Thus, better option is "alternate historically accurate". Or simply "practical and appropriate for the setting" which'll change on the setting itself.
---
&gt; Failure is a lazy way to add some twists to a story.
---
Failure is the only logical solution, the commander just blew everything they had at Mordremoth but still managed to kill Mordremoth. They blew everything at Kralkatorrik. If they win again, it will be a twist. Failure would be a logical continuation of the story.
---
Any idea how long it takes to get an authenticator issue resolved? I got rid of my old phone so I can't do an SMS thing anymore. Anyone had experience with working with support on this issue?
---
Not arguing that point. You can easily close it off in the last episode and have a new plot line begin next season.
---
The problem with the living world and mmos in general is that there is no clear cut way of telling how much time passes between chapters or within them.
---
So to us the commander being depressed may feel like a few minutes but in the world it could have been months.
---
I honestly would want the story to move forward already. I love dragons and like the Elder Dragons but I want something new already. Bubbles? Cantha and a none dragon related plot that may go back to dragons with Kuunavaang? Unexplored Tyria? Charr homelands?
---
Kralkatorrik's been a part of the plot in a significant way since Edge of Destiny. He basically triggered a major art in the personal story which ties in the the rest of the game.
---
TD is the bane of every GW2 player in existence and one of the best designed maps in the entire industry. HoT is generally brilliant in that regard.
---
Imagine the outrage if we beat kralk in a raid lmao
---
The face makes it perfect.
---
Watch out you're gonna lose supply.
---
If you're planning on pugging Fractals any time soon, it's probably better to get a Druid. Even if the "meta" shifts away from the chrono/druid setup for Renegade/Firebrand, it'll take quite a while for groups to actually *stop* respecting Druid, and you'll have the easiest time getting into a group (for Raids as well) if you play Druid.
---
I'm sure they'll kill her off soon enough, and stuff her mind straight into scruffy
---
Two shouts and the signet of ice, because that's a nice big heal.
---
People will also know what you mean if you use "they"
---
Awesome, I like seeing couples' characters. =D
---
Nothing because that would imply there would be an update to the core game
---
that would be...well..funny i can imgaine the outrage on reddit about it
---
Did you check your account with the link given above?
---
I have no idea why, but your character's expression and their general appearance makes this so much better.
---
Look at how irritated he looks LOL
---
....I had no idea that that's possible. For fuck's sake, that room.

Fishing could be a completely new line for Central Tyria, it would be cool if it came with ascended cooking too. For Pact Commander - improved crafting speed, maybe some storage/bank expansions (you get 1 stack/tab when you start and you can purchase more in gemstore but it would be cool if you could unlock 1 more via masteries).

The bearded lady is a special NPC for people who chose the circus as their personal story arc.

Would be nice if the fishing experience bar had the same light blue used for WXP

Thank you very much for the info. I didn’t even know you can’t get healed by others while in shroud. 
---
&gt; the sad fact is that such armor is basic and bland. Which is intentionally done since engravings could catch blades more easily or weaken areas for punctures and dents.
---
That's not true...
---
Engravings are rarer because it's insanely expensive, limited to mostly kings and emperors and out of budget for even most dukes. It's not because it's weak. Plenty of [historic armor](https://i.imgur.com/0bWXjOv.jpg) have ton of [aesthetics over function](https://i.imgur.com/5waOxaF.jpg). Stuff like [this](https://i.imgur.com/VBuLfvc.jpg) is more than just [engravings](https://i.imgur.com/iPD265n.jpg) but was popular. Armor have plenty of folds, nooks and crannies that would catch blade way more than tiny engravings. Bladed weapons do absolutely nothing vs plate with or without engravings anyway. And people didn't attack plates, they attacked joints between plates. Because you can't do much of anything vs plates. It's pretty evident when you watch stuff like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPbTWDeqQf0) and you watch people with a long pole axe swing full force vs another person and does only blunt damage vs armor.
---
Is engraved structurally weaker? Yes. But it would be so minuscule difference that it would hard to even measure.
---
I think you're definitely looking at power reaper, not at condi scourge
---
While it might work with Steam, it is not at all necessary. It is really, really easy to install without. Just install a recent version of 'wine', execute the installer exe and you should be good to go. Sure, some optimization might be achieved, but that's just some parameters.
---
Really - Steam might be nice for some stuff, but for this it smells overkill.
---
Happened to me once but only after I used a teleport to friend to get in

It does look like it makes for a striking silhouette, though.

---
Each colour corresponds to a specific room with specific puzzle mechanics to that room. The purple plat is fine - it lets you into the purple room like it's supposed to. The purple room is bugged. Every room (aside from the green room) is supposed to give you another plate which unlocks the next room. The purple room is currently bugged and will only give one person in the room the plate when the mechanic is completed (a graveling spawns and when it dies, a single plate is given to one lucky person, everyone else is stuck in the room).
---
Players have found that logging out and then back in gives them a better chance of getting the plate assigned to them, but it's common for people to get stuck on this room and never given the plate to go on to the next room. This becomes an even bigger problem when players have to finish all the rooms before a special buff runs out (a buff which takes at least one hour each day to get so it's a huge time investment).
---
So yes, it is in fact a buggy mess.
---
I'm surprised with my consistent 30fps on integrated graphics without it looking too terrible! Means I can play the game whilst at uni.
---
I get why people hate TD but honestly when you find out the different ways (shortcuts, nuoch wallows...) it's just awesome. 
---
Well I love tricky maps so I am a bit biased. Tangled depths, verdant brink and draconis mons are my favorite maps in this game, I spent hours exploring them and I enjoyed every second.
---
I didn't have any issues with it as a human Male at the time, but that was at release.
---
If you use online banking option, you get the key, once the payment is received, which can be couple of days depending on bank. If you would pay via card/paypal you would get key instantly.
---
Sounds a lot like our trenchcoat problem.
---
You dont understand how that payment method works, he didnt use card, he used online banking method. You get your key, once payment is proccessed and they will receive the money.

Like chairs?

Tengu Confirmed!?!??!?!?!? POG CHAMP!
---
Really depends on how much info you give them and what their support queue is looking like. I gave them a plethora of information to confirm my identity right off the bat (serial codes dating back to pre-launch betas, payment info, address, character info, etc) and it got resolved in &lt;10 mins. It must have been a slow day in support though. I've heard people do the same thing and it take a few days. 
---
As a person who has a great internal compass and never gets lost in a foreign city, to this day i still cant navigate td.
---
5h a day is a lot more than many others (me included) put into the game; and certainly enough to go for legendaries if you like them.
---
(I average 1h/day and I'm currently working on my second)
---

---
Sadly this tends to happen way too much. The event bugs once but because there is no on the map no new instance is created so it basically stays like that for a very long time. I don't think you can do anything other than reporting the bug and hope for a clear new instance to pop one day.
---
On a side note, are you on NA ? Because I have been a lot on this map recently (spare parts farm...) on EU and there were no problems.
---
happened to me in blue room, its annoying af
---
The underwater layer is a bit annoying, but otherwise I'd agree.
---
Funnily enough I like trenchcoats :D
---
Incest
---
Do not cancel the order or ask for a charge back contact support and see what’s going on. If you what I said not to to do they’ll ban your account 
---
So based on that, is there a place we can see the web page outside of the game to see the store live?
---
To be honest, for some strange reason I cared more about Vlast than any other character's death, even Trahearne's.
---
Yeah, I do. My achievment Radiant pauldrons are beautiful af.
---
When I finally discovered the underwater layer, I realized the HOT devs were geniuses. TD is such a well crafted map that Dragon Stand was a massive let down.
---
I'm not sure what to tell you, I literally did that event for Map Completion on an Alt like 3 days ago (EU). You might be able to use LFG to taxi to a different map maybe where it works? That's the only thing I can think of.
---
Yeah it might be a bit overkill, but I think the pictures might just make it look that way.
---
Some of these steps don't need to be redone with every game you install and once you know how to install an exe with Steam, it's very quick and easy to do.
---
Some Linux distros don't have recent versions of Wine. You would probably want to install another program to manage Wine, but now Steam has it built in. Steam also comes with DXVK which is pretty much needed to run DirectX 11 games which regular Wine doesn't have built in.

hello, welcome to the World of ~~Azeroth~~ Tyria.

the difference between F2P, Core, and Expansion Accounts is detailed [here](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF)
---
F2P can do the following: 
---
- you can reach max level (80)
---
- you can play the core story
---
- you have 2 character slots
---
- you can play dungeons
---
- you can play fractals
---
your limitations are as follows (though I may be missing some)
---
- you do not have access to the expansion zones
---
- you do not have access to the elite specializations (1 per expansion)
---
- no gliding (needs HoT), no mounts (needs PoF)
---
- your use of the trading post (auction house) is limited
---
- your use of chat is limited (whispering &amp; map chat is limited)
---
- you cannot raid (needs expansion(s))
---
I hope this helps :)
---
That sure sounds like it could be from the Witcher, yeah. ^^/s

I thought for sure Anet would fix the bugs with that room this week.
---
Nooope.
---
Makes me wonder if they don't consider the issues with this room to be bugs.
---
What do you even do when you get double purple plate?
---
Deaths of Trahearne and Aurene are tied for me :'(
---
The only way for a server to open is for Arena Net to manually open it. This was changed years ago
---
lvl 80 should take less than a a month to achieve. builds for PvE and WvW depend on gear and skill choices in addition to the the choices in the talent tree. You can have three active branches one can be an elite specialization from either expansion DLC.
---
These builds are save separately so when you enter WvW you have set a a new build from your skill trees and skills.
---
For sPvP all of that changes 
---
You could also just open a few wiki/build editor tabs and compare stats. It really isn't very useful because there's not more than ~3 runes that compete for same role in certain build.
---
Basically just not worth the effort.
---
Not to mention investing in ×3 karmic retribution. Never have to worry about karma again!
---
Fashion in armor design was a thing too. There's a lot of "endowed" armor for people to look "manlier". The big car of their time.
---
Thanks! Yep, that’s it alright.  The lighting obscured the carvings, simple but beautiful pistol.
---
Seeing as they never really promised a raid schedule they said they HOPED for 6 wings a year since when was the word hoped a promise. Like per usual the community hears something and magically turn it into something else. 
---
That's what I'm saying. People have been assuming the raid schedule is what they think it is.
---
yes but theres no mention of me having them, in fact it just tries to advertise the expansions,
---
And? I used PayPal that drew from my bank account.
---
There is no option for direct bank transfer. And even still, it should work the same.
---
No just said the payment was complete, returned to sellers page and nothing.
---
Thanks for the warning. That seems really sketchy though
---
to me it doesn't
---
Life's goal achieved! Hope you will live a happy life!
---
The boots are pretty beast for medium armor.
---
Literally never played a game where you pay for something and have to wait to get it. It's digital and even if my purchase was fradulent they could just cancel it or, like you said give me limited rights to the trading post if I could do some harm there.
---
I pay directly from my bank in all other games and never ran into this issue. Kinda disappointing honestly

Kralkatorric got tons of his current power from Balthazar's death at the end of PoF within the span of seconds. 
---
Remember, Balth consumed magic of two elder dragons, Primordus and Jormag (who both had some Zhaitan and Mordremoth magic), Glint's son, and a bloodstone. All of this magic was then taken by Aurene and Kralkatorric upon Balth's death. 
---
Somebody needs photoshop halo's pamphlet of earth with Aurene's face.
---
Because not everybody that owns PoF has HoT, and they wanted to avoid this: "WTH What thumb?!" moment. 
---
&gt;Pact Commander: Supply Line Optimization: An additional Pact Supply Network Agent now spawns near the crafting stations in each racial city. However they all offer the same items and buying from one will disable the other City Agents. Upgraded Vendor List.
---
I really want them all be in the home instance too. I would greatly benefit from this when I am doing my daily home instance farm run. 
---
I still have that thumb on at least 3 toons! :D
---
"Stopping X from doing Y" doesn't really make the story about Y unless Y is involved in the story for more than a singular moment.
---
In the case of Path of Fire, Kralkatorrik is merely a mcguffin, just there to further the plot, not be the plot.
---
I would like it if it was in the Home instance because I go there everyday to farm all of my stuff.
---
Could have done that in Desert Highlands...
---
There are 3 caps:  
---
100% Critical Chance (Fury boon, but also many traits and abilities part of it)  
---
100% Condition Duration (Some traits will give part of it)  
---
100% Boon Duration (Some traits will give part of it)  
---
There is literally zero cross-expansion content. There's no reason to keep it at zero.
---
Besides, the dialogue could trigger solely if the thumb exists in the inventory. They have that level of programming prowess. After all, that's how Knight of the Thorn and a lot of other Side Stories content trigger.
---
It just doesn't make sense to me that Aurene or Glint could still exist if destroyed. That is, I thought they were literally spawned FROM Kralk..in which case...they're just purified Kralk minions...Glint would have had to exist before she was branded in order for that to happen. And...I was always under the impression that Glint was branded from the start...so...why would she have her own soul? In other thoughts, would Elder Dragons themselves go to the mists when they die? See I think this is a bit of a plot hole currently...
---
Fetchez la vache!
---
Have you tried changing the port you use to connect? See the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) for more details.
---
I did something like this with Minstrel, because as soon as you craft it you get the musical item. Ship to the main account and bind it, then unlock musical item there too!
---
Yes, because swimming infusions are so useful.
---
Thank you so much!!!  I will pick Holo and start learn the class. Thank you very much. 
---
One last thing. How do you survive as a holo?  How do you heal yourself properly or reduce incoming damage??  As a reaper it is easy as most of the mobs go after the minions and you have shroud as a second health bar. Any tips appreciated. Thank you again. 
---
Way back in 2015 go watch the twitch con livestream on raids. They said they hoped to release 6 raid wings a year and like this community does hoped apparently meant that 6 wings a year was a promise and if they don't do this they have broke a promise they never made.
---
This is a newer bug that came sometime after Season 4 started.
---
The odd thing is that sometimes it works properly. I've done it twice since PoF and it worked once and was wrong the other.
---
Anecdotally, when I did T4 fractals every day, I'd get between 0 and 2 armor/weapon boxes a week, usually getting around 1. It's definitely a significant source of Ascended gear.
---
Raids also drop Ascended gear relatively often, but it's specific gear: You don't just get "a box of helmets" from raids. However, raids allow you to *progress* towards guaranteed Ascended with the Magnetite, and if you do enough raids you'll stack up the Ascended pretty quickly. You can get 150 Magnetite and 100 Gaeting per week, and you can trade in the Gaeting for Magnetite. You can buy gloves, boots, or shoulders for 150 Magnetite + 5g and they come in every stat set in the game! Raid minis or Ascended drops from raid bosses can be traded in or salvaged for more Magnetite/Gaeting Crystals that don't count against the weekly cap, and I've yet to have a week where I haven't gotten at least *one* mini or ascended item drop. That means you can get the cheaper armor pieces at approximately 2/week from Raids without even accounting for things like armor box drops.
---
I typically gear a character like this:
---
* Any drops from Fractals get stat-swapped and thrown on.
---
* Any Raid weapons I've been sitting on either go on the character or get salvaged for 60 Magnetite. 
---
* LS3 for trinkets, LS4 + Raid or Mist if harrier's (or just LS4 + Magi for the amulet, second earring and ring).
---
* Gloves, Shoulders, Boots from Raids, they're dirt cheap.
---
* Helmet is only slightly more expensive than gloves, shoulders and boots.
---
* Craft leggings, chestpiece, and weapons. These are expensive enough in terms of magnetite that I'd really rather pay the gold up front than have to wait a month of time gate to get them. Of course, to avoid a *different* month of time gate, you should craft the daily crafts every day.
---
... But that's me, with sixteen out of my 18 characters having at least one full ascended set. If you're just getting into endgame, you should follow the gearing section of my [Fractals guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) (that I need to update for the new instabilities and Chrono nerfs... RIP me)

Tybalt, Introduction
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
Have some [apple cider]
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Should have the NSFL tag ;(
---
Yea. Not shown in this clip is me using the plate to go back in and get *another* purple plate.
---
That would be amazing
---
I've just started the first part of Flameseeker and it's actually quite fun as it's pretty much a bounty hunter. Compared to kudzu, which what a collection of miscellaneous tat, it's much more interesting and having and anthology of villains is a cool concept. 
---
Cheers, I’ll give this a read
---
Two things I can think of are
---
1. Any thoughts on a class to start on
---
2. What’s the game experience like? I understand the base game is free with paid expansions, does not having any expansions diminish the playing experience?
---
Yes. The [Wiki page on the Illusions Profession Mechanic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusion) lists what clones/phantasms inherit from their creator what they don't get, but fundamentally they're a degraded version of the player's stats.
---
thx nici :)
---
Wasnt my intention. Thought it was obvious playfulness, guess i should have added a winky face ;).
---
I dont think anyone serious would say "Shhh", all they said was something along the lines of "Do you mean this spot" and posted a screenshot of the spot.
---
1. Depends on what you like. Anything is fine to start with, though without the expansions you cannot play Revanant. Engineer and Elementalist are more complex because you have a lot more skills to manage, but it's still fine. Mesmer only really shines at high levels because a lot of its functionality comes from specializations. What sort of thing so you usually play in games like This?    
---
2. Content wise, you have the entire game we played for the first 2 and a half years. There are a lot of restrictions on F2P players though--smaller inventory, less character slots, no map chat, restricted trading post. I like to view it more as the world's most generous free trial. If you get a good ways in and still like it, expansion time.
---
ikr, i think its because it gets much better later on, i watched s1 movie and im starting s2 now
---
Yes faster crafting!
---
TBH I have no idea why we have to wait for it anyway. It's not like it's super fun to craft 250 Fulgurites. Let us play the game instead of basically watching a loading screen. 
---
i watched the movie, it was quite good actually, but i also got so interested in some characters, like rox, that i had to read some stuff haha
---
Yeah, that was my bad, sorry.
---
I believe I'm using the scarf in this picture and it doesn't seem that bulky. Might just be because asura though.
---
im actually already considering buying that, theres also that achievment thing that carry on to gw2 too
---
u/chdaha the silverwastes map too, with its chest and RIBA farm
---
*eyes pitchforks*
---
The spellbreaker shoulders _are_ huge though...
---
Toughness doesnt necessarily mean aggro. Some mobs aggro on the closest enemy, some on highest damaging enemy etc. In open world clones would hold aggro most of the time regardless of toughness stat.
---
I don't know how did you calculate that, but I'm very curious how high the invulnerability uptime would be with WvW additions:
---
* \+40% endurance regen food
---
* Energy sigils that regain half of the bar

* Signet of Midnight over Arcane Thievery (2s stealth)
---
That's what I thought, I was just wondering really. Thanks!
---
Compared to Nightmare Runes (looking just at offensive stats) Lich has:
---
-175 Condition damage
---
-5% Condition duration
---
+4% Condition damage
---
+Jagged Horror minion
---
I can only assume that the flat damage and duration losses are made up by the % damage and the minion's attacks.
---
"Praise Joko, order pizza"
---
That means that you're not in your original instance and purple room is not on the routine for that instance. 
---
My LoD timed out before I got a plate from him yesterday. But I feel for you here. This room sucks.
---
Home instance gatherer: npc that loots all stuff there for you to collect at once, can even loot more days when not visited.
---
Insta loot sand piles, bleached bones, pact trade cashe, house of daoud trade cashe etc. (no more non nodes timer in new maps)
---
Most of the time I just resell Mystic coins (thats about 25gold/month) and dropped stuff (crafting materials, ecto...). I find crafting of no use as I play only PvE.
---
And Fractals
---
I've yet to visit instance that gives green plate as first. Map instances have fixed combination of rooms, always forcing people to do the rooms in the same order.
---
I'll take your entire stock!
---
That's why i said "Just be careful about toughness if you want to do fractals."

**Cairn** (first boss of Wing 4) is the easiest raid boss in the game, and barely demands *anything* to get the kill. 
---
**Vale Guardian** (first boss of Wing 1) is the ideal "first" raid boss because it teaches the importance of mechanics and positioning more than Cairn does, but is still relatively easy.
---
**Conjured Amalgamate** (first boss of Wing 6) is surprisingly easy to take down, though it strongly favors power DPS classes over conditions. This is a newbie raider's best way to get Gaeting Crystals.
---
You can actually farm up all the Magnetite and Gaeting crystals for a week by fighting the same boss over and over again, even *losing* to a raid boss will give you some. 
---
If you'd like to get into raiding, I strongly recommend joining the [Raiders in Training](https://discord.gg/SvsVzVQ) Discord server, where I and other experienced players host runs specifically to teach people how to raid!
---
Are fractals core?  I thought you could only go up to level 50 core?  Can't find confirmation online
---
Man, that looked so much better than the actual meteor shower.
---
Imagine if elementalists had an Arcane Energy profession resource. 100 points, +25 when equipped with Arcane.  Recovering 10 energy per second, 25 while out of combat. So fast you'd normally would not notice the cost.  
---
It'll only apply to weapon skills, and most would cost 5 energy, a few 15, and the ones with the longest cooldowns and the most power 25 energy. 
---
Then, being able to use skills while on cooldown, but activating skills in cooldown would [Overcast](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Overcast) your energy, reducing the maximum energy cap temporarily. 
---
Overcast energy would recover much slower, about 1 max energy per second. 
---
So insane it'd be tons of fun.
---
or if they will introduce a specialization that has spear.  
---
The grind was horrible, tedious, and expensive to craft this legendary. Kept cursing at myself for committing to it because I can't turn back now when I started crafting shards of the blade.
---
Then when it was all over, I don't regret making it at all. My main is chrono so it gets max use out of it. The skin gets used on my Holo and warrior as well. 
---
Second gen legendary is a hard process but it's because the rewards are so worth it upon completion. Except for a few questionable designs they choosed for some gen 2 items.
---
I want one for every room. Was Joko always this handsome? Those lips don't lie. (Or do they?)
---
Been working on my roller beetle for 3-4 days now and I am at the point of needing to purchase the Desert Luciferin for 50 inscribed shards but I only have 3 atm.
---
Is there a good way to farm them out?
---
Back when earth dagger 5 had a big animation (and longer cast time).
---
I watched all skill videos sooo many times. 
---
* Great Hall chests spawn whenever you participate in events. Each event spawns 2-4 of them. They will remain for quite a while. If you don't get chests after an event you didn't participate enough. 
---
* Palawadan chests follow a similar principle, but they can be a bit more random. Some chests spawn for all, others seem to require participation. If you didn't pick a chest, it may reappear after another event randomly in one of the many chest spawn points. After the last event of the meta an assortment of chests will spawn near the exist and across the meta area.
---
How well does it run on Linux compared to Windows on the same hardware?
---
We did not see her magic leave her body, which might become relevant to the story.
---
However, if it did leave her, then it is most likely that Kralkatorrik absorbed it all before he left. So no rampant magic from Aurene. 
---
I wish they would disable that room until it's fixed. I once spent 15 minutes repeatedly killing that graveling and questioning my life choices. Every time I see that the next room is the purple one my heart skips a beat. 
---
the spirit skills
---
So how does it actually sound? :s
---
2.Probably the [mercenary backpack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mercenary_Backpack). Check the wardrobe tab at the bank, but I'm pretty sure that they all clip with weapons stowed on the back. This one comes to mind as one that at least fits thematically.
---
Keep in mind traditional tanks in this game aren't so much of a thing. 
---
Outside of Raids, there is no tanking at all. In Raids, about 2/3 of the bosses require some form of a tank, and it's almost always the *support Mesmer*. Yeah, the light armor class. This is because Tanking as a Mesmer doesn't actually reduce your effectiveness at your other roles. You can still provide buff support just fine.
---
Try out one of the two Heavy classes you can play. Warrior or Guardian. Both are generally played as Support/DPS hybrids.
---
I'd actually recommend Warrior because a lot of the utility of it comes from Banners-a type of skill found in the core, non expansion game. You can be very effective as a core Warrior.
---
Maybe the connection that Caithe had with Aurene will be passed onto Kralk, just a thought
---
Every living world heart will sell it's associate map currency for karma! Good for the Season 3 maps like Ember Bay where gathering is slower.

It's not whether it's important to them or not, lol. His argument is 100% valid, if, say, less than 1% of the population actually care about playing instruments. 
---
Let me give you an example.
---
"Mr. President, can you please do something about this minor desease that affects 0.00001% of the society?"
---
"Who cares about that?"
---
"THEY DO, IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES, OK? HUMPF."
---
Apart from that, it makes no sense for ArenaNet to spend time and resources to make new instruments and please 3 people rather than focusing on things that will affect the majority of the population.
---
I mean, the issue wasn't that they didn't deliver exactly what they hoped. The issue was how far it was from that.
---
Aspiring adventurers? You mean humans trapped in their own personal groundhog day hell. Every week they'll play "Who can hit the hardest", and go first despite Big Nose Ted claiming he's gonna go first. Every week they wonder if they're finally going to see more of the world, if they're gonna join an order, be the hero they know they're destined to be.
---
Every week they fight a glorious fight in the holding cells below Logan's office until suddenly they're in Shaemoor again. In the midst of destruction. Letting Corporal Beirne tell them to go to the inn for protection.
---
But no one can protect the great hero Big Key Pharma from their fate. No one. 
---
I don't know if we need that. Fishing is boring in almost every game it has it.
---
You want to create a ranger that supports his allies? 
---
What an unconventional idea. You could try to make a druid build but I don't know whether the gw2 community is ready for such a unique playstyle.
---
Yeah, he's got a nice face and mouth, apart from the undead lichy thing going on.
---
Same.
---
 Went in. Killed it. Picked up my non-purple plate. Then I Left.
---
I met a guy today that did the purple room as his first room and he got the green plate..... 
---
She's probably not dead dead.
---
Wait, what? Theres a human female and a Sylvari in that picture, no norn.
---
I'll sign the petition ONLY if wielding it requires Chef 400.
---
Eh, I disagree. They use these kinds of community interactions to drive sales of their game. I understand that things can go wrong, but there is a point where even just your hopes can be so wildly off as to be irresponsible. It's up to the individual to decide if each case is at that level, but I think it's wrong to remove all responsibility from ArenaNet in such announcements.
---
In PvP the core sword/dagger build is really strong (almost meta ?) : http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQNAsYVl0MhenYpTwwJQ/EHtElOAOggz/Gtxc0viTsKA
---
In PvE it's not that good though. I know you asked for the same weapons but if you don't mind changing the dagger for a pistol you'll have a really decent build.

That button puts you in Vault A.  The rat event goes to Vault B.
