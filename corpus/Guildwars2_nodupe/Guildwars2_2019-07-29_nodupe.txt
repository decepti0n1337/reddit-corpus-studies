This is where philosophy comes in. If you are upset that people doing easier content are getting equal rewards, then you are not playing the game for enjoyment but rather to stroke an e-peen. My belief is that hard content should be done for the thrill/excitement/enjoyment and not for the carrot on the stick (the carrot in this case is just something for everyone to go for equally). I left gw2 a long time ago now because I found myself going after the carrot but I was not enjoying the path to the carrot. Play harder content because you enjoy the game being harder not because you want a bigger reward to show off to others (a.k.a. e-peen).
---
Link?
---
&gt; hows the population? the maps huge but without players to fill it it will be pretty barren.
---

---
Yeah, it's both a bad and maybe good thing. If you don't know where the fights are happening you probably won't see other players because of how big the map is. Unless you are in a popular spot like a town or area with a skyshard.
---
I took screenshot of population. You can jump between campaigns, but both 30 day campaigns will lock you to an alliance, meaning you can only play in that campaign as a character in that alliance until campaign ends.
---
Those 30 day campaigns in screenshot are 10 days in and the population goes up as the campaign comes close to ending because you get scaling participation rewards at end and a lot of people come in to get that near the end.

The locks mean a queue. It can be up to 40 minutes in my experience, but it is the weekend.
---
I’m not denying the fact that some people like to complete every single achievement or checklist. I’m saying that most people don’t even complete the games that they buy, much less do every little achievement and secret.
---
Right, and those people do different stuff. New content that comes in every three months isn't supposed to keep people busy for three months. WoW comes out with an expansion and people play it for 3 months, and have to wait a year for the next one.  That's normal.  There are people who stay and people who leave till the next expansion.  People bought POF and played it in a month and left, because there was nothing to do, and that's okay. And some people stayed and found stuff to do. That's the normal MMO cycle.
---
It seems to me that some people are going to run out of the content that suits them in any MMO. I'm not a raider. You could put in a raid a month and that would be zero content for me.  So obviously I"m more satisfied with this game than some others. 
---
But at the end of the day, no game ever has enough content for everyone. Because it takes longer to make content than to consume it.

I don't know how does it work rn, but before buying masterwork items every 5-7 levels was pretty much obligatory and cheap anyway.

hoarding gold? investing it?

just enjoy it, i save gold only when i don't have something i like on my wish list.
---
I wasn't aware of ANet employee's sitting in someone's house, forcing them to not play. Come on man. I get it, I hate when games I love make stupid choices. Fallout 76 still hurts for me. But life isn't going to be fair, and they don't answer to the players, even though we fund them. They answer to bean-counters and CEO's that don't give two shits about players. We've shown over and over again that we are complete idiots who will throw money at them for very little return. Check out Star Citizen for an example. They know we will bend over and take it up the ass and complain the whole time. But we still take it up the ass. So that's where we are, and we have to be able to walk away for our own peace of mind. Even though it sucks so badly that we can see how to make them even more money, if they would just listen to us.
---
Sons &amp; Flame team up, obviously.
---
Also turn shadows off if you haven't already. Shadows and reflections are some of the biggest hits you can give to your computer.
---
They are still working on them its just anet execs refuse to devote extra resources to it so the normal WvW devs work on it between regular dev duties. Effectively there are less than 2 devs working on it. Anet can be condemned for refusing to put extra resources into it though.
---
your title made me think they updated the character select screen :(
---
I think the "Pve game mode" quote was a typo and he meant PvP, otherwise it doesn't make sense with the other stuff he was saying.
---
&gt;Since 0 terrain changes were made
---
No. They had to fix several towers to stop people from being able to break in. These breaks weren't even hard to find out. They also had to remove the dismount hop because for some reason they didn't think that would be abused. They SHOULD have made terrain changes before implementing mounts. Instead, WvW received yet another untested product, which we all love so much to experience.
---
ALSO we don't really have a way to determine their 5 year plan or whatever, but on launch, gw2 had an active stance AGAINST mounts. (The world was too small.) Even the current territory system is used to limit mount advantage.
---
You're free to have your opinion on stuff talked about above. All well and good, no qualms here, but acting like adding mounts to wvw was a smooth release is perhaps worth reconsidering.
---
Though sadly, there's more and more of the pink car.
---
theres even a reddit for tracking the births of new subreddits r/birthofasub

Try sticking with your map after it finishes the post-meta boss rush.  The map will reset all the way back to the beginning, which then gives you the chance to earn lots of keys by doing all the little events in a region.
---
Several commanders will try to run Dragonfall by moving around the entire map, tagging as many things as they can to get a maximum amount of keys.  Finding such a group might be beneficial to you!
---
i've done that by accident with the mesmer underwater movement skills
---
Here I prefer my high fantasy to have the majority be functional appearances over either "edgy" or "silly" stuff.
---
Sadly, it seems what I want is in the utmost minority and tends to be the blandest, low level stuff.
---
&gt; Have someone who's been here since betas I can tell you this is a huge improvement to the "pirate ship meta" from way back when. 
---
Worst meta was scourge meta just after PoF 2nd worst was pirate ship after the stab change. But the current meta is probably the 3rd worst given no stealth counter and the fact that the meta is still dominated by scourges for damage. And is not a good meta in any way.

There are much more pros to turning off chat than letting it remain 
---
1.	If people are being toxic most players cannot help themselves and retaliate with more toxicity. That doesn’t help you win the match. 
---
2.	if players are typing anything at all they’re generally being inefficient compared to actually playing the match and probably could be doing something better with their time. Typing is often not as useful as being an active/proactive member. 
---
3.	low elo players are likely communicating misinformation. So while you argued that promoting positive strategic communication is useful low elo players literally do not know how to communicate in an effective manner that contributes to winning a match because if they did they would be higher ranked. 
---
4.	honestly for me, any typing good or bad is a distraction. I’d prefer to focus on doing my absolute best and ignoring my teammates reactions to it (good or bad) and if there is any feedback I need to improve I surely won’t be looking for it from players stuck at the same rating as me. I’d rather recruit a better player to give constructive criticism to assist in my improvement as a player. 
---
In my experience with competitive games. Growing as a player means shutting out your team because you cannot control what they say or do and the only thing you have an impact on is your own gameplay so all your energy should be devoted to that and not to your unpredictable teammates.

Build templates, cooking 500 and swiss tournament is all you need for the next 2 years?

&gt;Edit: And this post is instantly downvote bombed. Could someone please tell me why this post is so offensive?
---
Nearly every post gets heavily downvoted in this sub, unfortunately. I've no proof as to who these heavy downvoters are but my guess would be people who don't even play the game anymore.
---
.....what do you play as?
---
I usually don't get random haters, but a few days ago, I had someone tell me to stop using staff on my Revenant. Not only do I not use staff at all, it became apparent this person confused [Vengeful Hammers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vengeful_Hammers) with [Surge of the Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Surge_of_the_Mists).
---
I'm with you. I feel like it's always either totally edgy or super rainbow ridiculous. It's like people forget all the things in the middle.
---
Gave you an upvote back. For justice!!!
---
Oh man Abyssal Forest is the one I definitely want. Arcane's great too but I lucked out and got that one already.
---
And yet, it doesn't have a Charr Birthday Suit. Meanwhile, I can jump over to FFXIV (Which ALSO has a strong fashion endgame), and be a completely naked catgirl.

Arenanet should fix this. I want to show off ALL my musclefluff on the big demonkitties.
---
Zinn's a neat pick but if we get an Asura legend it had better be Snaff.
---
Were also holding out for a nicer looking charr... but we cant all get what we want.
---
The great part about toughness on reaper is there is a trait that gives you power for it. So i load up on power toughness and vitality, get my minions out and throw around vulnerability for even more trait related toughness and i find myself hitting like a truck most of the time. Especially with shroud up.

For a lot of us, Kormir's instance was a bit of a joke...  [Because we knew Kormir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6_4)
---
What did you expect. 2 years no reward, guess it really is a *fractal* after all.
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
I do as well. I LOVE dps Berserker right now.
---
Problem is, pugs in CMs are super narrow-minded and think that Banners are a necessity and will force you to play BS anyway.
---
I really liked that instance. Go in to mourn Aurene's death, she's like "I'm fine, lol, why you think we killed Joko first?" Then you both fuck off through a portal and beat the shit out of Kralkatorrik some more.
---
I hope they will tell us something before the end of the year cos it's nearly 2 year from first announcement, but do you think it will be a lot better with alliance? Im not soo sure
---
Quaggan says you can go foo yourself, thank you very much.
---
I would bet that the majority of upvotes on this post are probably people that primarily pve (nothing wrong with that) that have dipped their toes in the world of pvp and had a bad experience . I’ve played around 5k ranked matches over the past 5 years (respectable, but not outstanding) and I’d say only 1/10 (on high estimate) had someone that was legitimately toxic. The majority of the pvp community is very welcoming and supportive in my experience.  I think everyone that plays the game should give it an honest shot and ignore the occasional assholes (their behavior is a reflection on them, not you). Give kindness and honesty and seek skilled opponents that help you get better.
---
I'd honestly like to see banner's either made to grant the same bonuses as the stat traits (like Ranger's Spotter) and just not stack with them, or to just provide basic boons (eg. Instead of granting power the banner just grants might). 
---
The first case would be the least disruptive, it would give warriors an easy way to provide a large variety of currently class restricted buffs, but give them the option to open a utility slot when one of the classes that already grants those is in the group. I don't think this would entirely fix the issue, but it should at least mitigate it. 
---
The second would be a pretty harsh hit for the current builds, but if a full diviners (or harriers)  warriors could provide Full might with just Banner of Strength, Permanent Fury and vigor with Banner of Discipline, Permanent protection and decent uptime on resistance with banner of defense, Good regen and some alacrity with banner of tactics. they would probably find themselves in a really strong position where they would be able to fill a support role very easily, much like Diviner's Rev currently is. This would make banner specializing builds in demand in a support-y dps role while removing the unique role the banner currently fill.
---
I cant speak for them but I have very little time in my week to play this game. Im happy with what I've been able to achieve or acquire as far as skins n such go. If I wanted to craft a legendary in less that a year (with my schedule) I would be trading the few hours I have of fun content for farming. To make it worse they keep adding "new content" that is just more months of not doing what I think is fun.
---
I could care less for things that I want in the game, it’s long gone now. Sure you can defend their team or whatever but who’s left in the game is going to be the few of you who are fangirling over the devs for no reason... until you don’t.
---
The second option sounds like you just want a Herald
---
I just wish my graphics looked that pretty lmao
---
If you go with the second option warrior literally becomes more meta. Might, fury, vigor, regen, and alacrity all on one class? Holy shit
---
Your rig must be an Elder Dragon itself, to pull off graphics like that.
---
Heh. Funnily enough, a single Elder Dragon is actually quite minor [on a global scale](https://i.imgur.com/X6KFh3l.jpg). Tyria is fucking huge.
---
Devastating for a region, sure. But that's it. Hell, Zhaitan did probably less damage to coastal regions than the vikings did in their fivehundred years reign of terror and he was an eldritch undead abomination!
---
The biggest threat of the Elder Dragons isn't physical, it's societal. They come at the peak of ambient magic, when all the societies's advancements and technology and basic functions are based on that abundantly available. versatilely utilizable resource - and take it all away. Bam, it's stone age again.
---
Yeah, sure. Large parts of a few continents will be wiped off the map in the progress, but that's hardly world ending. Know what's world ending? Killing them. And having a Super Elder Dragon that devours all of reality and the stuff it's made off.
---
Jormag, a single Elder Dragon at the arse end of the world that's been put back to sleep?
---
Not a world-ending threat.
---
Congrats!
---
theres my boi quick in chat dissing void lul
---
I've tried previously and my issue and reasoning for changing it was not a "Valid" concern. Its upsetting seeing as its something that sorta stops me from enjoying the game.
---
Nothing suggested it was the final mission besides all the NPCs saying "everything's ready to stop Balthazar"?
---
only daily reward is the hero's choice chest like with every meta
---
Mhm. Names with just a bunch of numbers Arena Net tends to fix.
---
Why should that be daily limited?
---
to maintain the economic value of amalgamated gemstones.
---
I enjoyed that there's a little bit of unique voice work if you're a human who was said to have been blessed by Balthazar at birth. There's also a bit in Season 4 (no spoilers) that also has you referencing your devotion to Balthazar.
---
I still think that the Balthazar fight is the most best story fight they've ever done. Everything in that fight comes together beautifully. Music, voice work, mechanics. The imprisonment mechanic carried over from Season 3 giving veterans a little something. The sword skills that give it a bit of an overpowered feel similar to when your gravity gun gets supercharged in HL2. The animation on Balthazar's sword disconnected from his body giving his whole fighting style that godly/otherwordly feel. The atmospheric shift is the battle goes on and Kralkatorrik literally transitions from the creature we're trying to protect into the game's primary antagonist- going from stunned by the war machine to fully participating in the fight. All of this with Joko's statues in the background showcasing all three antagonists for the PoF/Season 4 days.
---
but op want to do chak gerent.
---
This changes things 😂😂
---
So wait was that actually a GW1 quest then?
---
Because if they didn’t, people like you would be laser focused on repeating only the single most profitable (or enjoyable?) meta repeatedly.  I really don’t get why you’d want to repeat this one, instead of having some variety.
---
Exactly! Resembled! Dzalana is also snowy mountain tops
---
North to the Kodan homelands where they will be passive aggressive and rude to you for six episodes
---
So too can you, just saying
---
Does it break the game to repeat one even every two hours? Is that really laser focused?
---
I think if we removed the cap, people would still be able to do the HoT train, since other events follow by it anyway.
---
So, just like /r/Guildwars2 then.  Home sweet home.
---
Somebody buy me some new eyebrows because mine just just got brunt off from all this fire.
---
It has more to do with keeping traffic spread out at different events than just the economy. This means people who need gemstones are doing a lot of different content, making it viable for other people to do.
---
Scarcity drives a consistent price-line.
---
Why wouldn't people who need gemstones do different content? 
---
Chak Gerent respawn is on a respawn timer of 2 hours.
---
This is even more prevalent for casual players, who tend to only have 2 hours to play a game. They wouldn't have time to make it to the Chak Gerent twice or even three times.
---
Meanwhile, the hardcore players who would farm Chak Gerent are in the minority.
---
It's not just the gerent that's limited its' ALL the bosses. They didn't single it out.
---
They're bear-ly passive about it tbh, pretentious white Yogi's. New map currency = picnic baskets
---
maybe?
---
Why should those bosses, who all have 2 hour cooldown timers, not have repeatable reward?
---
I don't think you quite get the damage your idea would do, but to give an example look at the Silverwastes. That is the result of an event without a daily cap. It is the only core tyria event chain that is regularly run outside of rare times when the devs add an achievement or event that requires you to go do the Orr temple events. So yes, it really DOES break the game to be able to repeat events without a daily cap. Yes, that IS really laser focused. You have people who hate doing the Silverwastes feeling compelled to do it more because it's the most gold per hour. It doesn't matter that that's a lie and that the best gold per hour is doing a few minutes of a variety of activities or events and then logging off for the day, Silverwastes is better than other farms you can grind forever, so it is run all the time. There is almost never a time slot where there isn't a SW squad in LFG.
---
Woah butthurt much. Two things
---
First, I do try to explain it and have all major concerns even edited in to try and clarify it better. You are just anchored by the dumpster fire downvotes that are going on. In some ways, they/you are correct, clearly some parts of this subreddit have the attention span of a fruit fly and I should have answered the questions in the 'edit' before I posted it. I assumed the community had the thoughtfullness to understand that '' I understand '' and its given that the system cannot be directly ported without coming up with solutions for the lack of role clarity and gear level. I even mentioned this fact at the very bottom of my original post (right before the edit) but the community still insisted to comment on it for digital points. The system about dungeon roulette and duty finder in its fundamentals is a godsend for gw2 even when you dont want to believe it now. 
---
Secondly, maybe instead of just being butthurt about someone on the internet you should try to add something to the community as well even when at first it might fail because you are misunderstood.
---
The skyboxes were also likely just what was in Hoelbrak during Dragon Bash this year.
---
If you really find Chak Gerent enjoyable, you'd repeat it regardless of daily rewards or not. Besides, there's always event rewards/Crystalized Caches
---
it was from irenio back to the days they got the first talk about their new team system.
---
I honestly don't remember if it was on the forum or on a live stream.
---
It really depends on what the scope/theme of this season is going to be. If Season 5 is still "part" of PoF, then Dzalana would make sense. But if they're really pushing the "Living World Seasons are Expansions" angle, then they're going to probably push for Shiverpeaks and things like that.
---
Personally, the thing I would be interested in is Fire vs. Ice. We spend the season waking Primordus and Jormag up and luring them into proximity with each other. I'd love to have a map like Dragonfall except it's Jormag and Primordus and the meta is to direct the dragons to attack each other. Then in the story we have this plan to kill them both at once and have Aurene replace them but, surprise, Primordus is actually stronger and just kills Jormag and takes its power.
---
I guess thats the point where pug strategies need to adjust.
---
On deimos BK can be done by HK during phases and needs no special assignment as in current melee strat.
---
But yea, same amounts of mechanics would be handled by half the people. But that is not really different from now.
---
Yeeet

That's not it at all... this game has an obsession with accessibility to the point that prestige is meaningless and unheard of.

What's the most broken class to play?
---
[removed]
---
Most easter eggs in gw2 come with a "hidden achievement". You can register your account's api key with gw2efficiency and look up which hidden achievements you are missing.
---
Chronomancer.
---
While I think that Eir would work well as a legend, I also think it'd be a terrible idea in practice because seeing people walk around with her as a legend would be a giant honking story spoiler for new players.
---
There isn't really a single class that's "completely broken".
---
Oh the irony of being an Ossa Rev and choosing to use the Awakened to safeguard Amnoon, though...
---
Do you have a second F2P account? If not you should give it a try. You'll love it right up until the second you try to buy some gear on the TP.
---
Trahearne would be a walking plot spoiler for any new players, at the very best you'd get Riannoc since he's not alive at any point in the game.
---
No, you're Fabulous!
---
Welcome to GW2. Join us in WvW and help us take back **JERUSALEM**
---
I'd adore this idea. Raids could be intertwined as well and have minimal story like 'some Primordus champions are popping up, help kill them'. Cuts down on raid dev time and would allow for some sick fights.
---
I try to stay between 2 and 3k gold, in this spectrum I just purchase what I want without even thinking about the price. For example: I just bought the harrier inscriptions and insignias our of the tp instead of farming them. Or food, I just buy 50x no matter how much I actually need. Even when it’s just a test food :/
---
Wow idk how you got all that information but that's awesome. Guess my theory wasn't correct at all, thanks for the info! Sounds interesting, though a fishing mastery line sounds kinda eh
---
I don't really agree and I think your argument is a bit of a stretch. I don't see why we would stay in Elona for a few reasons.
---
From the teaser we know it has more of a snowy thing going on and not just this "a little bit of snow" but more like a snow storm. Which means it has to be in an Area where there is a lot of snow already. Dzalana, as you said, doesn't strike me as such an area because if you look at the [historical guide to tyria from that_shaman](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-1399.25&amp;y=1351.75&amp;z=2) and in reference to [this](https://external-preview.redd.it/vdGhNGUXfYuPd413ccvH0NwBTR7jKkx1NyoE5Yjichg.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=eba4cb2d22273c281793b35f2e7f4b64e7919078) Dzalana was probably the first resting place of Kralkatorrik and more purple than White. Another thing is that the Map in the game doesn't have that much "snowy" areas in that region and while we know that ArenaNet could add this it is still a desert area with a lot of branded. I also think you mixed the directions a bit since Dzalana is more to the east of Elona and not west?!
---
Last but not least, just because the "recent expansion was in Elona and Elonian reasons" doesn't really mean we will stay in that area at all. Look at Season 3 in which we went all over the place, only Bloodstone fen was really in the heart of Maguuma while the other went to the shiverpeaks, kryta, orr and even the ring of fire islands.
---
So, in the end, the Story takes us wherever we need to be but I don't see that we stay in Elona and somehow discover a Snowy mountain range in the middle of an arid or desert area.
---
I'm basing my conclusion on anecdotal evidence, because nobody has any idea how many players are actually playing GW2. But what I do know is that people outside of this reddit don't talk about GW2. You hear about FFXIV, ESO, Destiny, Warframe, Path of Exile, and so on, but not a peep about GW2.
---
I don't consider anything really broken. However there are some classses that can 'carry and make gameplay really easy' As in makes gameplay trivial i would currently say: Healscourge in raids. Minion master in open world (as in you just pres autoattack everything dies). As for fractals I would sayt a good Healbrand can easily carry an entire group.

Menzies in the fissure of woe, especially since the burning forest and the armies of Menzies were part of the ending of LWS4.
---
Player housing is a great idea for GW2 imo. If Player housing is the ”mastery” part (gliding/mounts) of season five, I have complete faith that ANET will make/implement housing really well. Housing offers a point of cash flow for the company too. Without the influx of money coming from an expansion, ANET will need either a season pass or something with great gem store selling points. It will provide some long term progression to the game also. 
---
What other features would you like instead of housing?
---
I sort of agree but ANET is made of several teams. I'll preface this by saying that maybe the number of people on each team isn't right. ”Housing won't fix WvW...new repeatable content”- ANET already has working teams (presumably) dedicated to these area you listed. WvW “has” a team working on it. We will get new specs regardless of any other content (this is probably the most guaranteed announcement for the 30th). Raids/Fractals/CMs are all worked on by a team (although it probably should be bigger). Unless they add a new fractal like feature we won’t see new repeatable content. Raids and fractals is GW2’s answer to this portion of PVE. The teams should probably be bigger, but housing, mounts, and the mastery system does not take away from that area of the game. Housing/mounts/masteries are more important to the longevity of the game. GW2 needs to have something desirable to purchase from the gem store. Yes, you can scratch these features and have a raid/fractal every LS update but that hurt the longevity of GW2. You can’t monetize Raids/Fractals. Housing provides a long term progression that is more news worthy/marketable through the gem store. While I agree that WvW and repeatable content needs to be released more frequently, you can’t dedicate everyone to those areas. Last time, ANET made a massive WvW zone and everyone seemed to hate it and complain. Yes, that was several years ago, but they dedicated a lot of resources for that project which didn’t go well. This said, I do believe we will see the alliance system come with the announcement in a month from now.
---
ANET wouldn’t abandon housing as that would be an avenue to monetize the game through the gem store. Either ANET is going to announce a season pass that costs 20-30$ or they will need a huge gem store cash cow.

If you say you wanna buy the expansions maybe and start a new class I would recommend you to to kind of a restart with a class. It really really helps a lot at least playing the last 30 levels, in open world. You'll get a really nice feeling for your class.
---
So if you buy the expansion I would recommend you to put some extra money into living world 3. You got currencies there from which you can buy all ascended trinkets plus backpiece. Farming the map bitterfrost frontier is probably the easiest and fastest method.
---
The weapons and armor will get really tricky. You can either craft them, get them random from fractals (low chance), get them from raiding or get them from world events tequatl and triple trouble. Secret tip!: if you finished Hot you got the cheapest method to get an ascended weapon (caladbalg, just look it up on the wiki as the ascended variant). You just have to to some achievements, but it won't take you that long. 
---
I got my first ascended armor by crafting and one rare drop from tequatl.
---
I was farming gold each day and was able to craft one piece of armor every 2-3 days.
---
Sooo, first start with your trinkets, playing your way up to fractals while getting more agony resistance. Concentrate mostly on daily fractal achievements first. Try to play triple trouble and tequatl every day.
---
And if you say you wanna start raiding. In my opinion you can start raiding with exotic gear it's totally fine. BUT, you need to put some effort into it and learn the mechanics as well as your class. It's really no easy content and you have to life with the fact, that you will play full dps and get as much damage out of your class as possible, playing a classcanon (same with fractals to be honest... ^^). You can also start playing a supporter but they are mostly harder to gear. You can get your full exo gear rdy to raid in 1-2 days for power dps classes.
---
If you wanna start raiding I would recommend you to watch some videos or look up mechanics, builds etc on the internet.
---
&gt; The problem is that it sacrifices no damage to take the best unique buffs in the game, banners.
---
That might have been true before the recent rework to berserker. Now there is a big difference between a dps war and a banner slave. Its not a massive earth shattering difference but thats because warrior doesnt have best options to increase the dmg via utilities its just more PP uptime and signet of might.
---
You misspelled raids
---
They just added minions to GvG.
---
Pve which is best?
---
You never had a jello shot?
---
Everytime im at the character select screen and my wife comes in the room she has a laugh at my norn girls. Currently got the profane set on my tempest cos IMO its one of the best looking light armour skins for a chick

You can replay the missions by going to their starting point marked by a purple icon instead of the green one. You will miss some banter/mail in-between those missions. Or replay it twice ;)
---
Welcome to fractals ! Here are my advice for your situation as someone who managed to get his gf to do t4 as she started from a fresh account ~ a year ago. This is assuming you have at least one expansion (masteries available) as otherwise this would be a very different and much more costly journey.
---
* First you will do T1 dailies (lv1 to lv25 fractals) in order to get pristine relics. Those are important because they are the best way to get your first two rings (10 relics each). You can expect to get 4 relics per day. If people can carry you on higher fractals, this can be way faster. This will get you your first 2 infusion slots.
---
* You will want to have your fractals masteries done ASAP. You are better off selling fractal encryptions before that is the case (I think the second mastery is the one that improves rewards). That said, the real reason you want masteries is to be able to buy Agonized Essence in order to attune your rings. This will get you 2 more infusion slots (one for each of your ring).
---
* You have 2 options for ascended accessories : if you have access to any living world episode that allows you to buy one with map ressource + magic then you should go for it and farm for these (it doesn't take very long). The episodes you're looking for are LS3E2, LS3E3, LS4E2 and LS4E6 (you should have this one). If no episode is available and you're not willing to unlock them, your best option is to use laurels : 40 laurels and 50 ectos will give you one ascended trinket. This should give you 2 more infusion slots.
---
* Your best ascended back item option will depend on your unlocked episodes as well. Most living world episodes offer one, LS3E6 is interesting as orrian perls are easy to farm and costs karma instead of magic. This will give you one more infusion slot.
---
* As a thief, you probably want to play either daredevil or deadeye, I'm really not well versed in thief matters but would advise daredevil. Either way, you can get the only weapon you'll really need with your specialization collection ! It'll be a bit more costly to get the staff since HoT spec collection are more expensive but both are your best bet for a fast and relatively cheap weapon. This will get you 2 more infusion slots.
---
* At this point your next step is probably going to be infusing either your rings or your back item. Both are going to require fractal specific account bound materials : vials, globs and shards of crystiallized mist essence. A ring will require 5/3/1 of those and a back item will require either a glob or a shard depending on the item. Most back item require 250 ectos to get infused. This represents 3 more infused slots but might prove hard to unlock as those materials are hard to come by. You have several options to get them : do fractals regularly and you'll drop some but most importantly get fractal relics that you can use to buy the materials at the mastery vendor. NB : you can convert one material into 3 of the lower one via the mystic forge. At this point (since you already have your rings) you should convert your pristine relics into fractal relics to get these (much) faster !
---
* Once you have your weapon on all your infused and attuned trinkets, the painful part begins with ascended armor. There is probably no path around crafting for you : you'll have to level up your leatherworker to lv500, buy the armor and insignia recipes you need and craft them. This is expensive and has some time gating involved (that you can circumvent by buying the end products which is slightly more expensive than crafting by yourself). Expect costs to be around 80-100g per armor piece.
---
* I didn't mention ascended amulet since it doesn't give any infusion slot, it is still an important part of your gear that you should buy with laurels and wvw badges of honor at the wvw laurel vendor. If you really have no badge of honor for this, you can buy it at any regular laurel vendor for 5 more laurels (30 total).
---
This is starting to probably to an overwhelming amount of information, I'll stop here and let you ask for more details if needed.

PS : for any gear you're going to buy, pick berserker stats (power major, precision and ferocity minor).
---
People aren't that strict. In 100CM and 99CM groups with high killproof requirements you'd probably be bashed for not playing these classes, but in regular T1-T4 fractals you can run pretty much anything, as long as you're sure you know how to play your class. 
---
Fractals usually have pretty short encounters, where high burst damage is the best way to fight literally anything. That's why Dragonhunter and Weaver is picked, and also Soulbeast for the spirits.
---
Also it's very possible to run Chrono + Druid instead of Alacrity Renegade and Quickness Firebrand, but that's not as good nowadays.
---
Keep in mind that power will always outshine condi in fractals. While condi can get huge numbers, it takes quite a bit before it happens. As long as you're playing somewhat good power classes, you're fine in fractals. Check out [discretize.eu](http://discretize.eu) if you wanna see some popular fractal builds.

This is what you said

&gt; I'm willing to wager that a larger percentage of the playerbase will get  more time out of a new story/zone than than would out of a new raid.

&gt; I’d wager that a large percentage of the player base logs in for the story then after a few days stops playing until the next chapter.

You can totally solo most of the fractals as a reaper also. (There are a few that have mechanics that require more than 1 person to like open doors &amp; stuff like that and for those you need to pug couple people)

As a free player you are limited to what you can do on the trading post.  The Trading Post is also shared. Items you list can be bought by anyone in the world, and you can buy from anyone. And it doesn't matter what server you pick. Servers only matter for WvW pairings.

Why the heck is this account bound. I want to send this to salty folks during World bosses so bad. I'd carry a stack of them for such an occasion.

C'mon be adventurous!

fantastic!

the servers only effect wvw,in pve it doesn't matter which server you join, only the region matters as people on the NA server won't be able to play with people on the EU server.
---
T1 is super casual. I was intimidated too, but decided to give it a shot when crafting Frostfang, and everyone was super friendly. One time I joined a group that decided to do T2 instead, and when I suggested I leave because I had 0 agony resistance, they offered to carry me instead. Got a berserker ascended ring and a fractal weapon skin off that run too! You'll be fine.
---
Anet, hire this man!

This way was quicker also whatevs ;)
---
This post is about...?
---
In most MMOs, the trading post is divided by server. Here the trading post across the entire game. Being on one server gives you the same prices in the trading post as being on another server. Your finances won't be affected by which server you pick.
---
As many have said, server at this point in time only affects WvW.

Asura college of gender studies
---
Its possible, but you'd to have to re-adjust your stats, namely lower your burn duration to that the additional expertise from swapping all non-viper gear to viper can make up for the loss.
---
Generally speaking (and not from a min-max DPS perspective as I generally don't care to look into maximizing) a mix of core guard traits, the firebrand traits, and Balthazar runes gives you a *lot* of leeway for burn duration so that you'd need a minimal amount of expertise to cover the rest (which typically is why you run non-expertise sets once you hit that cap, though from the min-max perspective its partially because aside from Axe, none of your weapon skills outright apply a condition; i.e. most of your condi procs are on-hits from stuff like Justice's passive burning, throwing pieces of paper from Tome of Justice, utility skills, etc).
---
As for actually going about doing something like that, we'd probably have to wait for GW2Skills to get updated to the latest patch (if it hasn't already been updated) on the off-chance that the changes between then and now have a significant impact on what you can use to change the build.
---
The Priory brainwashed me ;-;
---
&gt;It went over like a lead balloon, but they tried
---
No, they didn't try at all. They let people see the alpha/beta version during HoT demo, the intial reception was 50/50 and they immediately gave up. The Stronghold that came out in the beta version, with maybe one balance change (bombers or treb iirc) and that was it. The  death sentence on the brand new mode was released without any attempt at, you know, tweaking the beta. Arenanet didn't give as shit so neither did the players in a long run.
---
I know I'm super beefy but what? Really?

I probably missed the "no u" meme train completely, but many times when I see this phrase, it mostly came from people who seek confrontation, drama and the likes. That's why I would be confused to, after being met with a "no u" when saying something positive.
---
sooo apparently since auto mod says I'm not allowed to make a topic even tho it's a lot that I asked... here you go... 
---
Hey, 
---
after being inactive for almost 3 years, I gave it a shot again. With elite specs being there I realized a lot changed coming from a core well wvw build.
---
Now... I read a shitton of posts and builds, but I just cant seem to figure out what's good tbh... everyone states different ideas, some cant play scourge at all and/or prefer reaper, others say scourge is really good... others again say that scourge is inferior to reaper and so on....
---
I plan on running both PvE content (focused on dungeons, fractals) and WvW. next to no pvp, and no focus on open world as that usually is rather easy anyways.
---
I have both HoT and PoF, so viper gear would be easy to get, as I already read in other threads.
---
Now my question would be, which specs shine in pve/wvw and where do you see them going in the near future?
---
lol thanks

This game environment is so harsh for newcomers (outside of reddit).

Played for around 100 hours so far and whenever I asked something in game i have either been ignored or ridiculed by other players 90% of the time.
---
Content itself is very badly designed for newbs as well. Cannot search for anything on the map, the game does not explain what professions and mats do, the way the world works (horizontal progess) is never explained etc...

No wonder a game like this is not gaining new players and therefore is getting smaller.

I wish they'd scrap rebreathers and just have it as a skin slot.

They make PoF zones better, they don't make Core or HoT zones better, they make them a cakewalk.

• Angel McCoy did Sylvari.

• Ree Soesbee did Charr.
---
• Jeff Grubb  did Asura.

&gt; Though I think there needs to be better earned skins in game...
---
Better start looking for another game then.  ArenaNet sold their soul for micro-transactions long ago.  I've got ~ 29 legendary items (armor, weapons, backpacks) and the in-game offerings are either a time-intensive grind (Aurora, Vision, Coalescence) or an enormous gold grind.  The market space offered by the disparity between time-intensive and gold-intensive items is terrible.  I love the game, but if "you" think this is anything other than a calculated way for them to push cash shop cosmetics "you're" crazy.  
---

---
You used trident #3 which is a leap backwards.
---
this game is not about "i press this one skill and do 100k dps".  
---
the teamplay in this game is: i have a character geared on what the community agreed upon after benching the "best possible dps" and now i have to constantly rotate my skills over x minutes in a raid while doing different tasks to be top dps. for example, depending on the class ofc, in a raid you can have a skill usesage of 600+ skills in a 7 min fight.  
---
good luck keeping up!  
---

---
It's okay, we like it. Flaunt your fashion sweetheart!
---
Hopefully never
---
I don't think you can give warrior any sort of alacrity without breaking the game. Organized teams would run PS warrior for alacrity/might and chrono in raids or quickbrand in fractals for quickness/fury and that leaves room for so many dps classes. It just goes against the recent changes to reduce power creep to put one of the best boons in the game on already the best class in the game.
---
HoM was a legacy system due to Anet moving on with development to GW2. Introducing such place in GW2 would mean they are releasing new game or at least wrapping up development for this one and going into maintanance mode.
---
All fantasy relies on realism to make the fantasy appear more natural in their world. You can't make a world with gumdrops and men flying by twisting their heads really fast and try to make that engrossing.
---
 There's a reason there are guns, ships, and teleporters all with logically reasoning behind them. In fantasy, not everything is fair game. Which is why there are dozens of terrible fantasy worlds that people hate because they don't abide by their own logic and instilled realism like the last season of game of thrones. Somethings are definitely more realistic and grounded than other aspect also.
---
Wow I love this!
---
It's literally a 3k dps difference for condi berserker and 2k difference for power berserker. To bring buffs on chrono they lose 20k dps or more. Banners are a massive group dps increase, they're 10 targets, and they have an insanely low opportunity cost. That's why warrior has been meta in every endgame pve gamemode for 7 years.
---
can you heal it?
---
I wish I had this problem.
---
Yes, definitely! It's welcoming and nice community to spend time in and the story is great in my opinion :)
---
One interesting thing is if we go to northern shiverpeaks, what if we refind it?
---
It is not. There's many situations in which speaking can get you killed.
---
In this particular case, there's a lot of information that shows that communicating is good, there's no doubt about that. What matters is what you communicate and how you communicate.
---
So the 'inaction' I talk about won't apply to all communication in this case, only to communicating about things that will not result in any valuable player reaction or feedback.  
---
They already gave us one roadmap some time ago. If they merely repeated themselves, the responses would be probably negative like "why it is taking so long", even thought we know at least one of the reasons why, they had to restructure. 
---
So the 'inaction here is not speaking about plans they are still working on. But doesn't mean no action at all. They are going to talk about something else instead in the August 30 announcement.
---
You can just go to the priate festival skritt vendors in LA and get a portal stone to go there.
---
Well, we still have Guild Hall trophies even though there's raid and world boss achievements. 
---
It could be interesting to have these achievements with titles unlock actual trophies equivalent to the titles to place around your home instance.
---
Not in fixed spots like the HoM, but decorations you can place however you want.
---
&gt; Home instance or player home?
---
I think you are referring here to the situation that you can't customize the home instance otherwise it is very personal since it contains a lot of those characters you encountered over the personal story, your nodes and everything.
---
Most of what is story related is in its own Home instance ... instance. For example, you won't see Harvesting nodes or Cats when you go into it but the problem you are describing could still happen.
---
Personally, I would like it more if this would be combined. It is our home instance and It should be our go to place for our character, our home. I say this because as soon as we have a player house the complaints about moving all of those nodes to the player house would get louder, the Home instance teleport item would become pretty negligible (unless you enable it for the player home as well). And we basically would have a part of the game that you will never ever see again after completing the personal story and maybe coming back for regrowing Caladbolg.
---
&gt; Scribing
---
I don't agree with this. Scribing is impersonal because it wasn't meant to be personal, it was always something for the guild and not the player itself. You would have to restructure it and reduce the prices or requirements drastically to make it affordable for the individual player as a form of player home decorations. And I don't think two sets of crafting recipes would be such a good idea that are differently pricey depending on doing it for the guild or your player home. 
---
&gt; A reward to reinvigorate the game
---
How large exactly do you think the player home will be? With all that decorations this is more like a guild hall sized "player home". However, while there are a lot of decorations already in the game this pretty much contradicts what you said before with "player housing decorations". Why would you be able to place Guild decorations in the Player house and not vice versa?! this would lead to a lot of confusion.
---
&gt; Monuments
---
I'm sorry but I had to chuckle here a bit. A lot are complaining that ArenaNet is creating throw away content and yet this pretty much is the same. We already have a home instance so we could have the player house in that instead of creating something new. We have a hall of monument which was already used for this specific thing and I don't think we should reuse it instead of just have it once and then never ever have to go back there again! We could have a Asura Portal that brings us to the hall of Monuments, maybe we could even rebuild it which stores our accomplishments like Trophies of victories (like Raid boss wins or Meta Event boss slayer) and monuments.
---
&gt; Nodes
---
So, like the farm plots you can buy from the gem store which creates a farming plot in your home instance that you can plant different plants?!
---
While all of this sounds somewhat good I would rather have they rework the existing home instances so that certain things are available to the player you are looking for like decorations and such. However, making scribing available for the individual player would mean decoupling it as being a Guild oriented task and reducing the overall price and material sink it is now like making those material more accessible and/or reducing the amount of things you need to craft for certain things and generally streamline it better. For example, [why do I need  basic basket for a Square cabinet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Square_Cabinet)?
---
So, I don't know about you. I would love to see that those things we already have in the game would be revitalized instead of just adding new things to it and slowly but surely lose sight of what we have. Personal story = home instance, Season 4 = Sun's Refuge and then "player house" = everything else. The same with the Hall of monuments. I mean the title already says what it should do. (let us) Rebuild it and store it for what we have done.
---
Can't really decorate in the achievement panel with those things in the achievement panel lol
---
Depends on the patch.
---
This isn't a game where class mechanics that can be abused never get fixed. Chrono used to have one button they would push, which would basically give everyone full boons. This made them the most valuable support class in raids. Then, one patch, they just removed that ability from the skill. Chrono was still wanted for quickness and alacrity, but it caused the community to start looking for better support options.
---
It's a bad idea to chase what's "best" for a singular character. Best changes constantly. If you make one character thinking you'll always be best, you'll be quickly disappointed if that class then gets a massive nerf, putting in a bad spot for months.
---
Find what you find fun. Play that.
---
Sail the high seas for premiere pro.
---
why just trophies, if we get housing we'd like to decorate stuff too. i like the dungeon props idea, we could make arah inspired "hideout" etc, but anet would also need to give various biomes for that. like in path of exile its rly fun decorating your own place there. you get naked biome and place decorations. we would need some building/pavement decorations too though.
---
hard mode for specific boss fractals.  
---
common/standard classes via the LFG.  
---
defensive boons are more powerful / accessible in melee.  You're more fragile at range lacking protection, vigor, regen, resistance, stability etc than you are in melee.  it is counter-intuitive.
---
Let's hope NOT.
---
I'll add that there's no direct trade between players feature and all economic transactions between are maintained by Trading Post (auction house if you prefer). Trading Post works cross-region and it's anonymous - there's no info about who's selling the stuff there.
---
However, there are not supported by devs ways of trading between players without Trading Post involvement but it's kinda risky thing.

GW2 is the kind of game that takes a few hours to learn, and a lifetime to master.
---
You may not become the top tier players in any of the game modes, but you'll catch up to the median in no time.
---
What on *earth* is your server? O_o Usually you should be able to get useful posts, even if the trolls might also respond to you.
---
Anyway : start small. Start by taking camps, sentries, and reporting enemy activities to the map chat you're in. (Don't use team chat unless you see very strong enemy presence in the map, or T2-T3 towers/keeps are being attacked.) I recommend starting with your home borderlands since it tends to be more......shall we say, dutiful people who watch over the stuff over there. Pay attention to people who respond to your scouting messages well. If there are at least 2-3, start asking map chat if anyone want to go help take some T0-T1 towers or T0 keeps. Those are activities that tend to be available without needing a zerg in home BL, and in my experience people are generally happy for the company.
---
When all else fails : unless your server REALLY HATES PPT, ask if anyone would like to help guarding a camp that's feeding into a tiering objective (usually keeps/towers going from T0 to T3), and if there are any takers, go to said camp and drop an omega golem in it. Get in the golem and guard the camp. Call people for help when you can't handle the enemies. People are generally pretty appreciative of camp guards because it's a boring job that nobody likes to do lol.
---
Since your server seems pretty hostile to newbies, pretend you know what you're doing about while you do these stuff and observe how people behave when they do theirs. You should be able to remember a few regular names soon enough.....I hope.
---
What server are you on? Also team chat is for memes and call outs on my server, so it’s not super kind to people who are new and asking basic questions. Map chat is nicer but still mostly call outs. If there’s a commander that has an open squad you might get more answers from squad chat, but typically getting on discord and asking questions in between fights in voice is really the way to get more info. A lot of the wvw community can be burnt out depending on what match up they get. In NA, getting stuck in permanent tier 1 or tier 4 for rankings will make people really cranky because those are the most boring tiers.

Been through a few recently. There are only two I formed a proper opinion on because they were both outstanding in different ways. 
---
ShotCut is up there as one of the most frustrating programs I have ever touched. I'm sure if I were to keep using it and fully understood it I could work with it, but to me it was just far easier to trash the thing and go download something else. 
---
Speaking of which...
---
Davinci Resolve was quicker to download, learn, understand, and make a video in before I even had the audio set up in ShotCut. Currently this is my default program because it mostly does everything I want it to do. It takes a small moment to learn how to work with it, but to me this was pretty easy to understand and use. At the very least this is a fantastic stepping stone towards Adobe Premier programs that I will pick up somewhere in the future.
---
Damn perma-stealth thieves tapping my haus!
---
Herald has been one of the most irrelevant elite specs PvE wise consistently, making another herald isn't really fixing anything.
---
SO cute. Maybe I should actually make an asura char....
---
A team of 5 tanky blood magic/condi reapers will absolutely wreck face in fractals. It'll be a bit slower on kills than a pure glass cannon DPS builds on kills - but that's provided those DPS builds don't ever die. In the long run, it might actually be faster overall since the whole team will be so survivable, and with transfusion can res downed players in the middle of their DPS rotation.
---
Thank you!
---
Even tho there is alot of talk lately about Gw2 dieing and people being burnt out most of this discussion comes from veterans who already consumed alot of what gw2 offers (or atleadt alot of what they wanted to consume from the game) and now they feel burnt out due to a drought. 
---
Let me get this straight: While i still believe levels 1 to 80 are a chore to get through, what the game pffers at level 80, if you enjoy a horizontal progression system, is amazing. no matter  gamemode you play there is plenty to experience and thousands of hours of potential fun. Out of personal experience i can say that guild wars and the fun you have in its content ,lives alot on guilds. Alot of the content may seem boring or frustrating but will become more fun if enjoyed by a group of people with VC etc. (yes this counts for every game , bzt the experience in pvp or wvw or heck even if you run raids fractals or meta maps changes Alot when experienced with people you know or you are in a guild with). 
---
I'd definitely recommend anyone to try out the content present at level 80 with a guild of your liking and i sencirely hope that you anf all the other new players will find a guikd to your liking and with which you can enjoy this vast game
---
What chat code is this? And where did you find it?
---
Laid off old, expensive and experienced developers, and replacing them with new and cheaper. Lose 1, get 2 kind of a deal.
---
&gt;Maybe tomorrow...
---
I’ll want to settle down
---
Until tomorrow 
---
I’ll just keep moving on
---
Yes. And this is one of the worst things about gw2.
---
Wow, they look so terrible.
---
Most of the decorations in the "Trophy" category aren't just crafted, but earned via successful completion of content. Adding more Trophy decorations as rewards for achievements could achieve what the Honor monument did for GW1 without limiting it to a static spot. Going the extra mile for 10 AP is kind of boring.
---
Weird.  None of the names I came up with for my Norn were available - I backed out after trying a few times, and went with something completely different for my Sylvari. 🤔
---
That's a really good point. I don't really like those DPS meters but you're right on the "no feedback" part. I'm 100% I'm seriously under performing right now with my shortbow out taking it easy lel.
---
Yes please!!
---
Creating another fluff feature is also waste of resources.
---
Just FYI the design a weapon contest winners are gorgeous and easily obtainable (at least that is my understanding, been meaning to get them but I keep forgetting!  ) : https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Design-a-Weapon_Contest
---
I hope you have fun!
---
And also to echo the reply currently below me : the large scale combat is mad fun. I didn't recommend you to start with it because it can be a little intimidating, and some groups can be.........unfriendly to people without meta builds or poor performance, but once you've got your feet a little wet about what WvW is like, find a commander who's running an open squad (i.e. you can click on their icon in map chat and 'join squad' is not greyed out) and join them! It'll be one of the best things you can do with the GW2 combat system.
---
Gw2 is the best MMO on the market, no doubt about that. Current sentiment in the game is a bit negative, but this is mostly from veteran players who already did everything in the game and are not only angry on gw, but also on how gaming industry and especially MMO genre was developing in the recent years. For someone new, this game is extremely worth playing, nothing else comes even close.
---
Player base is enough for what ever you wish to do (if you are mostly into wvw, check which servers have good population and active community, which is an exception as it is server based and not cross realm like everything else is). 
---
Wow classic is around the corner and the buzz around it is affecting whole pc gaming industry not just gw2. Twitch streamers are definatelly adding to the wow hype as they think they they will have a lot of viewers (there will be like 10k streamers) and are happy to play something else (this is not only true for gw2, but for other games like PoE too). This will change some months after launch, as people realize there was a reason they picked gw over wow in the first place, but whatever.
---
Game is healthy and worth playing, also I expect some kind of road map to be published soon from anet and population will greatly increase once wow hype diminishes. But like I said, as a new player, you have SO much to do, that new content doesn't really matter for some time.
---
And then there is Tarir.
---
&gt;Are you sure you want to log out?
---
YES
---
Banners are boring and I hate micromanaging them. Let people pick the banners up and wear them ffs.
---
Pretty much anything can do that since we all have self heals.
---
If you want to be able to go full healer at any point I'd suggest ranger.
---
No that's after graduation
---
[And so our story begins..](https://youtu.be/ZcLQoWlz4l8?t=6)
---
Maybe it's something else, but on my 1st try, I ended up with the fern wolf, not the bear (and had to change the name on the sylvari menu from the norn menu, as name was already taken... so idk \^\^' ... just an assumption)
---
I'm also weirded out by female asura having emphasised feminine chests on some outfits. Just no, please.
---
Gosh this is fantastic! I *must* know what pieces you used. The Shrine Guardian Ears I recognise, but not the rest
---
this is my little black cat !

Game has improved tremendously since 2013, though most of the best content is post lvl 80 personal story, as the core game has aged a bit and is lower quality compared to the expansion content.
---
However, as you haven't played for a while I do suggest making a new character and leveling it 1-80 to  learn the class reintroduce and reintroduce yourself to the game's mechanics, story and world.
---
Definitely, the community is great if you're doing open world stuff, if u ask for help in map chat etc... but when it comes to higher level stuff, the majority if the community are toxic and elitist as hell.
---
I’m pretty sure the Mini Queen Jennahs are worthless once you unlocked it in the wardrobe. You can turn the salvage kit into the Mystic Salvage kit, and as for all the instant level-up items, use them for your weekly key farming character, or save them for if you wanna make new characters.
---
HoM and player housing mashed together would be awesome
---
Only to other races. Charr are proud of their bodies, and don't feel like they have to hide anything.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty disturbing.
---
Unlock the mini jenna then throw the rest away
---
You can transform boosters into loot and combat boosters for some silver they might lose duration and i think you can t select karma boosters for some odd reason https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Trader_(Armorsmith)#vendor29
---
With the salvage kit and mystic stones make mystic salvage kits(250uses) and use it on the rare drops you don t need https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit
---
If you rly want the exotic weapon skin unlock it and use it or salvage with the blacklion for more ectoplasm and the sigil or the mystic salvage kit if you are low on blacklion salvage kits
---
I know, right? Who mixes stripes and spots like that?
---
So the advice I can give is that in lower tiers, it doesn't matter too too much what you play, thieves are fine and can actually be pretty baller.
---
You probably already know that you need [agony resistance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Agony_Resistance) to be able to do the higher fractals, which means getting that ascended armor/weapons/trinkets so you can. This first hump is the hardest imo, cause you can easily get ascended by raiding/fractaling, but you need a set to start doing that. You will probably want to invest getting your crafting professions to cap so you can start working on those. Rings/accessories/backpack can be gotten by farming certain living world maps. Rings specifically, look into something called [attuning](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attuned_equipment) and [infusing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infused_equipment) to get more agony slots, you can have your rings both attuned and infused, and it doesn't matter what order (attuning is cheaper/easier.)
---
When you have your ascended gear, my rule of thumb is putting a +9 agony resistance infusion into every slot you have (range from like 7-9g on the tp.) The sweet spot is to hit 150, but you can realistically get by with all fractals with 135 ar and a [potion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anguished_Tear_of_Alba) from the potion vendor in the fractal lobby, since it will give you 15 AR if you have the fractal mastery unlocked.
---
Also what might surprise you is being a support/healer is actually a thing now, as it wasn't before HoT came out (besides you old school water staff eles out there.) A lot of classes are taken just for the benefits they give to other players, like Revenants, Mesmers, and guardians for their [alacrity buffs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Alacrity) and [quickness buffs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness) which are just as important as keeping might up. Healers have also diversified to where rangers(druid), Guardians(firebrand), Revenants(either), Engineers(either), Elementalists (tempest), and Necromancer(scourge) can all be built to heal comfortably.
---
For high level dps you'll see a lot of necromancers, warriors and guardians dancing around because survivability becomes quite important, but of course anything can really go as long as you're good at what you do and you can pull some good numbers. 
---
Final word of advice, try to find a group that will run them consistently with you! It's more fun with friends, more fluid,  they're more accepting of non-traditional builds and more accepting of mistakes.
---
I love it!!!!!
---
Unbelievable.
---
Only if you're feeling uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the game, it's systems and the combat system.  I think the game feels best with a fully unlocked elite specialization as soon as possible.
---
Because there's value in having a coherent aesthetic. 
---
Nothing quite immersion breaking like exploring a new map and having someone dressed as a literal clown with their neon glowing clown car mount darting back and forth in front of you.
---
You can still have a huge variety of skins and customization without sinking to Korean free to play MMO cash shop levels.

I pug CM's and T4's very nearly daily, for well over a year already. I've run into maybe two individuals doing that sort of stuff.

All garbage.

i'll never understand why people upvote underwhelming screenshots of the most common motifs like this. sure, throw new players a bone ever now and then but... that is an outfit worth a a few hundred gold, and iirc a makeover kit hairstyle... so not a new player. maybe it's just a new toon? well then what's the point 🤷‍♀️
---
No we don't.
---
My recommendation would be to find some friends to play with, playing with even one other person you enjoy spending time with makes one hell of a difference. If it weren't for couple of friends I met through the gamemode I would've probably stopped playing WvW or GW2 altogether.
---
It makes me think, how we as humans think about Charr having 6 nipples and the consequences of that, but Asura are probably thinking "Yeah, the ears are small, but they do have 4 of them."
---
It only appears on characters that have finished HoT, so that might be why you hadn't noticed it before. 
---
If you have already been done for a while, then I don't know what to tell you, it's been around for a few years at least (I don't remember if it was there at HoT's launch though)
---
It was added as a sort of sidestory some time after HoT. The statue will appear for a character after finishing the HoT storyline. You should've also gotten a letter to start the "[Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn)" sidestory.

This is like a JoJo Stand. "...Walk like an Egyptian!"

Afaik this is actually the name of the place since the map is just a remake and translated by that_shaman from a ingame map found in the durmand priory. You can check the original map on the Wiki.

It because everyone at plat+ thinks they are fucking naru zeromis and toker.

You are right. I just pick the worst case.

Attack Ebonhawke chickens.

Human, choose commoner, get to level 10 (scrolls, etc), do personal story, receive key. Can get a key once a week, resets Monday at reset.
---
If it's a 45 minute presentation of basicly nothing of course I'm gonna get disappointed. This game needs content and real rewards.
---
and there are still people downvoting content like this. is memelord discord band really that mentally ill that they have to downvote eveything but posts which trashtalk anet?
---
Oh damn, I wish I knew about this before making so many asura. Most of my characters have small ears, I'll have to fix that now.
---
Depends on what your after. 
---
GW2 has much to offer. Pretty much something for everyone. 
---
What GUild Wars 2 broadly offers:
---
Story, Crafting, Overworld PvE Content, Instanced Content (Fractals and Raids with Dungeons being a stepping stone), PvP, WvW (Server vs Server), Fashion Wars, Collectibles (in terms of Achievements, Mounts, Legendary Weapons/Armor/Trinkets, etc.).
---
What Guild Wars 2 clearly doesn't offer:
---
Gear Treadmill
---
Doesn't mean Guild Wars doesn't offer Progression, just not in terms of stats. If you are looking for a MMO with Gear Progression this one is not for you. Gear you earn after your first Ascended Set is only for 3 reasons usually:
---
Cosmetic (Cool Skin)
---
Prestige (Hard to get)
---
Quality of Life (Legendary Equipment can swap Stats and Components for Free on demand)
---
Another form of progression is very much in terms of Player Skill. I know this is not a thing exclusive to Guild Wars 2 but Guild Wars 2 was the most demanding in my experience. I also played WoW, Lotro and ESO by now and only ESO came close with its Animation Canceling Rotations but those are more rythmic and more easily learned in my opinion. Mind you you don't need to achieve this to function. Most content in GW2 can proably be completed with 20% of whats possible to achieve in terms of player skill. But Content like PvP, Raids will probably ask at least 80% of whats possible to achieve as a player and that is not so easy to achieve. Hence the small Raiding and PvP Community. (In Numbers, any dipshit can dish out 5-10k DPS on any Character but only people that have a viable build, know their build and can play their build will be able to push DPS numbers like 25k-40k, Number varies alot by DPS Profession and mastery, 40k being around the maximum achieveable right now, 25k being around 80% with lower performing DPS specs - Not that DPS is the only thing that matters, but its calculable and compare-able)
---
If you got time on hand and don't mind starting fresh there isnt really anything against that since the Level Up Experience in Guild Wars 2 isn't too long. Shouldn't take you longer than a Month even if you play casually.
---
You can probably knock it out in a week or two if you play alot. A day if you know what you are doing and have the gold.
---
If you are looking for anything but Story out of this game you can pretty much jump in in any expansion or level. The learning curve will be alot steaper which should be expected, especially if you jump in with an expansion since they increased difficulty alot with the expansions but it's doable and it would probably be faster to jump in at lvl80 and learn the ropes then than to start at lvl1 and learn the ropes as you level. You won't save too much time but you would safe time.
---
The Story in Guild Wars 2 is in my opinion the best of any MMO I have played yet and will only be enjoyable and make sense if you play it in Order. (Makes sense but should be said, some MMOs have cut off single expansion stories that can be enjoyed seperately, this one does not. Stuff will be referenced and characters are reoccuring so you will not care or know whats going on if you play it out of sequence.) But for those reasons the story is alot better than alot of other MMOs.
---
**TL;DR:** GW2 has no Gear Treadmill, if thats not a problem for you give it a go! ;) It has alot to offer and pretty much something for everyone.
---
If you have any further questions feel free to ask :)
---
You talking Blood/Curses/Reaper, or Blood/Soul Reaping/Reaper?
---
r/recursion for if it was

P A N I C
---
I loved being the npc henchman for aurene.
---
It made everything we did for her since she was an egg worth it. 
---
She's a cosmic scale badass and you are there just for the ride. For me it was awesome.
---
Aurene was like... Meh for me, then all or nothing came and it all clicked. War eternal was pure satisfaction!
---
Most servers have a few regular guilds. If you're new, it might be difficult to find out what times they regularly run on. This is the best way to experience WvW firsthand: with other people, either in a big squad or small roam team (solo roaming not recommended for beginners).
---
Getting shitty answers to your questions might be a function of what time you are online. So try different times, mix of weekday and weekend, at least to find out if there is a time when there is a higher ratio of nice people.
---
&gt; Another form of progression is very much in terms of Player Skill. I know this is not a thing exclusive to Guild Wars 2 but Guild Wars 2 was the most demanding in my experience.
---
It would be if that level of skill was required for anything but it's not.
---
The more I look at it the more it seems obvious, yeah.
---
It's not a bug, it's a mammal. Bear with it.
---
They better announce the WvW rework release date, that's all I care about... I have enough pve content to last me until I die
---
Why does your Asura look like a frog?
---
Nice gif there, do more!
---
*Shaking*
---
Not played for a while - has mallyx pull from the last balace patch entered the meta?
---
If you want me to help you push into T2 and you're on NA I'd be willing to help you with that at some point?
---
One of the reasons why having healing skills is such a good idea.
---
IIRC it's actually just fan speculation from a thread in the lore section of the old forum.
---
In my experience 'general' WvW is Toxic. The best thing you can do is find a solid group that has a 'regular' for a commander and always join in their group, then ask your questions in /squad. I tend to avoid /team and /map as it seems men-children plague it mostly on my linked servers. 
---
Also, there are many ways to enjoy WvW. While doing the whole 'zerg' thing has its merits and you will get better/faster rewards over all, roaming with a small 6-12 man group is much more satisfying.
---
Wait...  team chat vs map chat?  What’s this?
---
If I’m in a Zerg, how does anyone know I’m playing a meta class or not?  There’s ten million special effects going off constantly.
---
Doesn't really make sense unless they also add armor damage like Vindictus
---
Vision.
---
It’s entirely S4 PvE.  Except the gift of battle.
---
I don’t want to be in here, you don’t want me in here, but here I am.  🤷‍♂️
---
Maybe female charr wear that chest cloth for the other races' comfort. It's symbolic diplomacy
---
Don't try to ask for help in WvW map or team chat since those are usually filled with memes and call outs.  Instead, get your server's discord and chat in there.  Find a guild, a lot recruit from the discord, and run with them if you want larger fights.  Most groups, most not all, run closed so unless you are in the guild you won't be allowed in the squad.  There are a multitude of reasons for this that I won't go into here but a lot of people get really triggered when they try and join a squad and it is closed.  They take it personally, for some dumb reason.
---
Anyway, join the server's discord and ask your questions there.  Most people will be very helpful since the discords are usually most active when the people are not actually playing the game atm as opposed for asking stuff in WvW where AFKing for 1 minute outside a keep or tower can get you killed or you fall behind your group.
---
Can’t wait to crack on at the weekend then!
---
Oh look, it turned out to be ever
---
I never notice the hints I got to admit! I usually binge through the content when I get time; no guild so I have to find pugs to get by. Surprisingly I managed the end mission solo but not the first Balthzar encounter...

That's adorable

What do you mean? It was a speculation video, so I went to see other people's takes on what he talked about. I
---
yah i usually goto a bank and check out every single wardrobe item and the wiki how to get the ones i like, then those becomes my "things to do" some are quick, some are slow, some require 10,000AP
---
No, not in zerg v zerg. It doesn't really fit the current play style of revs. Your biggest damage dealer is CoR and does more damage from range so leaping into the bomb to maybe pull a handful of people that should be locked up already isn't really efficient. On paper mallyx, looks pretty good, resistance/leap pull/boon strip but other classes do those roles better and frankly Dwarf elite is stupid strong and kinda silly not to take.
---
Didn't Wooden Potatoes do an Elite Speculation vid on that concept?
---
It's only 5% damage now but yeah
---
Hell, I'd pay for it.
---
Just to be annoying.
---
You can see what class people are playing in the squad ui. More than that, people can target you and see if you're running certain sigils, food/util, traits or utility skills like signets. And there's a lot of downtime between fights that people can check this. Plus time in combat that aren't fights (like pvd'ing) where people can see even more telling info. And people can check arcdps to see what skills you've been using.

Learn to balance your fucking game. Stop adding useless shit like Warclaws to game modes no one asked for. So glad they can't delete my comment like they do on their Forums. And wonder why they losing player base and money and just layed off half their damn staff. **Cause they don't listen**.

No

I can see why a Sylvari would want a bear pet though; after all to a Sylvari, forest fires are of even greater concern....

No matter if you are defending or not. Stop.

We already know that there were trolls around so don't even think that there is something wrong because it's not. Don't. FEED TROLLS.

Game is so much alive, every game mode, we know that, bye.

Guild Wars 2 has, and will probably always will be, the easiest mmo to drop and hop back into at almost any moment. This positive effect can continue to an extent, but I wish Arenanet knew that some of their silence may have a permanent effect.
---
I know this is "Stranger Things", but at the last panel, I had the "Dark Knight" theme going on in my head lol

"I think I chose.."

Just check your personal story jornal to see what you picked.

If by “peak” you mean “weak”...

lol ty, I wasnt actually expecting someone to go to the effort to tldr it for me. much apreciated

Probably the real reason why we don't have swimsuits, Anet doesn't want to deal with all the bs that they'll get for giving us shitty charr swimsuits lol
---
Oh, it’s definitely used in Hollywood for grading films (but not editing). The only grading apps with comparable market share for feature films are Baselight &amp; Lustre, but I’d guess Resolve was used to grade up to half of the movies you’ve seen in the last few years. So far as editing, that’s all done on Avid Media Composer, which you’d NEVER want to use on game footage. It’s an unintuitive dinosaur, and is lacking in many of the features from Final Cut Pro X, Resolve, &amp; Premiere.
---
I enjoy the heck out of GW2 PvE and Season 4 content.  Vision is a reward for doing a lot of that, and I enjoy it, so it seems like a great goal to set.
---
To clear up your curiosity:  I don't enjoy WvW, and so the reason why I do it is because ANet inexplicably made it a part of the requirement for the S4 PvE goal I'm working on.
---
So what you're saying is that you're willing to not have fun for 8 hours? You do you. I would personally just buy them if you're having more fun in PvE (I don't, which is why I only play PvP), which also means you can equip multiple characters at the same time.
---
Yeah I started reading because I was interested in what the arguments would be on either side, but then it just took a hard left that I didn't expect haha.
---
Tell that to t5 wvw, NA raids or high end pvp.

Just hide other ppls appearances ez

If you live long enough and keys pressing fast enough, Engineer has unlimited arsenals. Engineer is one of the few classes has both combos and combo finisher built in.

Take your own advice.
---
Try roaming as a Power Staff Daredevil in World versus World for awhile. I find that I can't enjoy playing any other profession in WvW.
---
Commander tags are good for creating ad hoc groups as well. I don't use one all the time, but getting some extra people to follow you just by putting one up can be very effective. As you can see in this thread, some people strictly only follow tags in WvW rather than do solo or party play. I've gone several hours in Eternal Battlegrounds⁠—*on Blackgate*⁠—while saying very few words, only throwing Superior Flame Rams in front of tower gates, or Superior Catapults in front of their walls. And winning fights just happens without any communication. Other people tend to take care of warning you when large groups of enemies are coming, as a good signal to run. But nowadays, you don't lose anyone's trust if your squad does get run over by a larger zerg.
---
Yup. I do the same.
---
I dont see any problem with just swimming in heavy plate armor like we do now.. none at all. \*drowns\*

Well I just negated his. Stop smiling! D:&lt;

You won’t gain anything from adding another generation of lossy h264 compression to the clips. If you’re doing a lot of editing, you’ll want to generate optimized media, such as ProRes, otherwise cut the original clip. Check your project settings to ensure you’re on the right frame rate before editing, as it can’t be changed once a clip is on the timeline. Also, bit rate and frame rate are not the same thing. Resolve expects a constant frame rate (tough for game captures), but this has no relation to bit rate. You may want to google some VFR solutions for Resolve. I only use it for real footage, so I’m not versed in dealing with VFR on that platform. The basic idea is that if you’re staying h264 then you should reflag the file as exactly 59.94 without re-encoding the video stream. I’ve done this in Cinema Tools (EOL, Mac exclusive) and Compressor (Mac exclusive), but I believe FFMPEG (multi platform) can do direct stream encoding as well.
---
Hah, I knew it.
---
It's not perfection what they seek, but low investment and high rewards. Perfectionists make sure they only have to do stuff once and only once, and they like hell correct every little detail they can if things go wrong. We have bugs that predate the game's release and vanilla maps that haven't evolved with the game's systems for example.

Anet is like Jason Blum, the producer of Paranormal Activity. The guy invests a relatively safe ammount of money on producing horror films of low budget and medium quality that generate moderate to low reception, but are still hits on the box office and in worst case scenario, end up generating at least a little more than what was spent on producing. This is the Living World + Gemstore tactic we're seeing here; it has nothing to do with perfectionism, quite the contrary.
---
And are my questions answered in there somewhere?
---
Also, some of these are old and have already been done.
---
They’re still crying about their friend’s layoffs. They give PR talks for the white knights to eat while they give fake updates for the wvw alliances. At least they give chairs for everyone to sit and wait in.
---
I’m with you. It seems clear ANet won’t give a road map (they could take a page from fallout 76.)
---
Another lost point, the next episode will be outside the 3 month windows again. As August 30th will be 3.5 months. You can make the argument that’s it’s between seasons, but this disheartening for the future of the game where we have long gaps between episodes that have little meat. Season 4 was stale and this seems like foreshadowing to another stale 2 years. 
---
My personal take on this is: this live event can be the make or break for the game. It needs to satisfy uncertainty for the future while also proving episodes are TRULY a replacement for xpacs. Thus far, we have not seen expansion features in these episodes (if you say new mounts you are fooling yourself.)
---
Bonus: they announce new content for pvp and WvW for the first time since launch.
---
Put us all in speedos and be done with it.
---
Wether you call it a roadmap or not, people got the informations they wanted.
---
They've given us new armor sets, which they said were expansion only.
---
The only thing that's really missing is new elite specs.
---
&gt; Please stop already.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; No matter if you are defending or not. Stop.
---
So you didn't even bother reading before posting?
---
"Please stop already."
---
The thumbnail makes me worried about pressing the play button.
---
I personally enjoy Sony Vegas, which handles shadowplay without issues. It's paid or $10 bucks a month, but you could also grab a cracked older version. They all do the same and its around the same level as Adobe Premiere.
---
PvPers for the most part don't give a shit about voice overs or that cute little thing you added in the back corner of the map.
---
New maps won't keep PvP alive but I feel like Anet can certainly do better than they are doing.
---
Eh, the guy moves the goalpost in every post and reacts with anger and namecalling ("wHiTe KniGhT!") when confronted with reality. First it's about expansions and how LW isn't content, then it's about how game X gets huge maps but maps provided by LS somehow magically don't count, and in the end he just starts to ramble. Dude's a blithering idiot.
---
I was about to agree with you, but I looked up the LW release dates on the wiki just now, and they actually only missed the 2-3 month window for 2 episodes (unless I counted wrong) out of the last 12 since season 3 started, and only to about 4 months.
---
But regardless I didn't post to defend that guy, I just thought that the way the OP turned so fast was funny.
---
 I tried this and didn't have a purple starburst. I think this was because I had already done the achievements for those story steps. Either way, I ended up just giving up and playing on a different character.
---
And new unique features we haven't seen before, or not-so unique features but done the GW2 way like "Housing", "Fishing" or "Boats".
---
Being able to do something we have not been able to do before.
---
Overheating in holo-forge mode puts the toolbelt skills on cooldown until forgemode is available again.
---
This is after months of nerfs to Holo overall, and now it's literally a 1 trick pony; great burst, but rather poor sustained DPS and an incredibly akward rotation - even by engineer standards.
---
7 years in people still want to provide excuses for lack of development, Give me a break. Aug 30 makes or breaks the future of this game for a ton of people
---
Ah, sorry about that, didnt put 2 and 2 together and thought you were talking about the necro thing in general and not specifically for the class. My bad.
---
I wasn't making a point about the validity of either person's stance. I just thought it was funny how suddenly the OP went from "I don't care much, this is just what I feel from reading the forums, not my opinion." to "YOU'RE A WHITE KNIGHT, THE CONTENT SUCKS!". lol
---
Anthem got one and you can see what happened....
---
best class in pve is guardian
---
excellent question OP, thanks!
---
Aurene becomes sicks. Turns out Palawa Joko is still alive inside and you have to cure her of her illness before he takes over her body.
---
For Chapter 7 I have only two steps: "Forging the Pact" and "The Battle of Fort Trinity". I see that in the Wiki there are more steps, but I don't have them. I see in Chapter 8 step 1 the largos  Sayeh al' Rajihd is mentioned, and she should be an NPCs from the "Make another suffer" storyline. Or does she appear in Chapter 8 step 1 regardless?
---
I was prepared to write some snarky comment to this when I started reading but by the end I really think you made your case here. This does seem to be the root of the problem and I don't know how it will be fixed (or if it can be fixed). I think a post like this is good for anyone going into game development or even just corporate management to read. Thank you for writing it.
---
Looks nothing like a moth, nor mordre
---
My experience is that when I do that, I just get facerolled by people who enjoy WvW and are good at it.  So it ends up me just running back from spawn again and again, hoping I find *something* to do so my participation doesn’t drop.
---
Don't you put that evil on me.
---
You should read reddit more in that case lol
---
I guess it is buggy then... Another weird thing is that I don't even have story journal chapters that tell me what I picked, as if I skipped the whole thing.
---
As any game ages, you will encounter bitter washed up players. Can't waste time on them. Just block. Try to make note of when active and personable guilds run. If you can't make time for any, then you would move but try to observe the situation a bit more closely.
---
One of the easiest ways to get yelled at is to take supply from a keep or tower that is low. Pay attention! Another is to repair a  wall being trebbed with no way to stop it. If you do both, you are in for disaster. Take supply from camps as they regenerate supply if you want your daily defender. It will at least look like you know what you are doing.
---
Do not stand still. The thing that difference between you and a pve mob is you know how to evade damage. Moving target s are harder to hit
---
Get geared. Full zerker probably isn't the best idea for a new player. Marauders is cheap and offers way more survival. For condi, you could use dire or trailblazer though later is more expensive. WvW tickets are decent for earrings gor speciality stats, rings much less so.
---
You could run the triumphant armor track but you shouldn't unless you want to wotk for legendaries. 8 hours for an exotic is silly. Sure you could use a booster but it is still bad.
---
Also avoid throwing your own siege if a commander is here. Never throw regular arrow carts down. They are bad.
---
I believe the threshold is ~5 personal fractal levels below the lowest fractal in the next tier, so 21, 46, 71 for tiers 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
---
...Still a real pain in the ass when your AR is high enough to do fractal level 90, but your personal fractal level is only 40...
---
Cries is Elementalist, almost nothing *only* drops us to 95% HP...Move like get hit once, heal, because they hit you for 60%+ of your HP and if they hit you a second time you dead.
---
I did most of the story with my guardian. It's doable but when I did LW4 with my necro, it was so much easier. Don't get me wrong, I love my guardian and she's been my main since I started playing 6 years ago. But some things are just easier with my minion master.
---
They can check your passive buffs for any utility skills/traits you have that may be wrong.  They can check your food/utilities to get a hint at your build (DPS vs healer, power vs condi).  Lastly if they have arcDPS (which they probably do), it can be very obvious if someone is using a non-meta build.
---
I checked, I think she is in Chapter 8 regardless...
---
Warrior.
---
About race, it's personal preference.
---
If you don't have any of those steps in your story journal then you started that character during the period where Arenanet streamlined personal story. They removed the greatest fears section entirely. They added it back in later but anybody who created a character during that time is still missing it.
---
&gt; Elite specs are the only thing worth being excited about
---
...for you.
---
What you don't just set it to autocast?
---
But do they give good oo-mox?
---
It's almost like you *wanted* to check all the boxes. Vertical progression, "Lw iS twO hOuRs ConTenT", gemstore bitching.
---
But hey, fuck getting huge maps for free with skins, mounts, horizintal progression, collections, achievements, extremely high quality and detailed content, dynamic events, fully voice-acted NPCs that actually do more than standing in the corner being a quest provider, and so on, and so forth.
---
tWo hOuRs oF ConTenT, dEd gAem! coLlEctIonS arenT ConteNT! RRee caSh ShOp! ExpaNsIons oNlY! Lw sUx!
---
I think some side stories mourning Aurene between episode 5 and 6 were needed, the resurrection felt way too rushed and forced :I.
---
Whats the name of your world?
---
That mouse replacement is a really great idea... I'm constantly losing mine in the chaos of the particle effect vomit.
---
Anthem had a lot more behind the scenes drama going on, much like wildstar, and gw2 is kinda going into that same direction sadly..
---
If you did the greatest fears section then it should be in your journal. No idea why it isn't. The story completion flags are messed up \*shrug*
---
Take solace in the fact that Ceera hates me as well. The hate is probably deserved but for other reasons when you consider all the decisions we've made as the commander!
---
the problem with gw2 is that in recent months, content has become something not worth investing into anymore. Draganfall, Coalescence, chronomancer in raids, necro with continuous core necro changes, and even the upcoming legendary runes. 1000+ g per, like wtf?
---
I feel your pain because it took me a couple of tries to find the right world/server + guild combination. But now I have a blast in WvW. I saw several really good, detailed responses you got so I won't rehash any of that. 
---
I will tell you that over a week or so I tried a few guilds and worlds, the latter cost me some gems but it was worth it in the end to find a good place and a good group of people to play WVW. 
---
A lot of people get salty (gw2 jargon for angry, agitated, upset, mean, annoying, and repulsive) when things go south, like getting stuck in a "bad" tier, getting wiped out a lot because the other group/guild is better, etc. But that is not the majority of people on WVW.
---
I'm not a big roamer so I don't know about that, but my regular group will go for 4-6 hours sometimes longer and have a great time. But WVW does have something like a day and night shift. I'm on the night shift but every now and then I login during the day and there are people from my guild and our opposing guilds duking it out so I gladly join in!
---
Have fun and hope to see you around in WVW (NA, NSP)
---
This is the kind of quality comment I expect from this sub. :)
---
This is good advice.
---
Specifically:
---
Big Spender (spend 25 badges of honor at the vendor - just buy some catapults. The daily rewards 20 badges back)
---
Land Claimer (Kill a guard and cap his circle)
---
Master of Monuments (Cap unguarded circle in ruins on borderlands / guarded shrines on desert borderlands)
---
Veteran Creature Slayer (check the wiki for their spawn locations and just wait)
---
Guard Killer (just kill NPCs, can be at camps, sentries, etc)
---
Caravan Disruptor (just kill a Dolyak - ezsauce for a Ranger)
---
Those are the easiest.
---
Camp Capturer (flip 2 enemy camps)
---
Tower Capturer (flip 1 tower)
---
Keep Capturer (flip 1 keep)
---
Are harder, though with practice you can solo Camps pretty easy as a Ranger, especially if you run pierce and line them up.
---
Objective Defender is tricky, but can be done without fighting anyone else. Just find an objective of yours that is being attacked by a Trebuchet, and repair one of the walls (1 tap is all you need) then wait on the timer.
---
Once you have 80 Potions of WvW reward, that's enough to complete a full reward track, but you'll get some points to that reward track every 5minutes you're in the game provided your participation is over level 3.
---
Regardless
---
Many WvW'ers crap all over players for this, but whatever.  That's how I started in WvW, just doing dailies, and now I play it daily in multiple WvW guilds.  Who knows, you might find you enjoy the mode after spending more time in it.
---
The best thing about GW2 is that you get experience for doing pretty much anything. There are guides on how to power level using crafting, but I would recommend just finding an area you think is cool and completing it (all waypoints, hearts, points of interest, and vistas). Completing an area will give you some pretty nice rewards and a decent chunk of experience in addition to the xp you get from the individual activities. 
---
You can usually find guilds recruiting in game (especially in LA or on maps with a daily achievement), but you can also check out /r/guildrecruitment.
---
I admit only read the start, I usually can't finish most cringe posts. So I am only referring to the part the guy said 2-3 month release cadence.
---
Maybe it was a bit pedantic of me to only tall about that, but there never was a 2 month gap between any two LS4 episodes, closest was 2 month 22 days.
---
EU :D
---
Is Holo the sub or dom
---
I skimmed it and stopped reading when someone tried to compare ESO DLC’s to GW2. ESO content updates pale in comparison to GW2’s.
---
I personally find core thief to be pretty fun while leveling up and getting back into the game. Stealth can be pretty handy to retreat into while you’re exploring.
---
&gt; *Laughs in Healing Signet and Adrenal Health*
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Imagine pressing 6
---
Laughs in Necromancer Heal Minion
---
Cool part of this game is that you literally get experience for doing anything at all. 
---
Is there a zone you didn't finish you'd like to go back to? You can do that and gain exp for it. 
---
Want to check out one of the other races starting zones? You can do that and gain exp for it. 
---
Want to try out PvP or wvw? You can do that and gain exp for it (mostly as consumables you'll have to click for that exp but it's still exp). 
---
Want to try some story mode dungeons? You can do that and gain exp for it
---
Want to try some crafting (tailoring maybe)? You can do that and gain exp for it (0-400 is about 8 levels of exp I think?)
---
If you're looking for "which zones are in that recommended level range" it's fireheart rise and mount maelstrom. Maelstrom is "probably" easier to get to if you've been following the personal story - it's southeast of Sparkfly Fen. 
---
For hero points: at this stage just get whatever looks interesting "right now", in order to unlock the elite specialisations from the expansions (tempest and Weaver) you first have to fully unlock the base classes, so none of your points will be wasted.
---
I tagged you and OP as "circlejerk boi" few days ago as main posters in drama threads. Coincidence that it's once again you two being OP and first poster duo? For sure.
---
Oh, absolutely. We had more of a 3-4 month cadence, and let's not forget maps like Kourna. But even that is still pretty good, actually. Basically a 3,6 cadence. Not great, no terrible.
---
There should be 2 or 3 things between Forging the Pact and The Battle of Fort Trinity. Your character might have been doing the story when ANet was mucking about with the ordering of the story and even removed some bits at one point.
---
Trahearne, I love you, but holy *shit*.
---
The combat? Fluid? 
---
Has no one here ever played Warframe? Uncharted 4? DooM? Neir: Automata?
---
How can he assume content like this gets generally downvoted if this post has a really high percentage of upvotes? This post alone (as are many others) busts that theory, unless for every downvote there are 9 upvotes.
---
make a character, go play around with the wardrobe at the bank
---
Guild anything would be nice
---
&gt; How can he assume content like this gets generally downvoted if this post has a really high percentage of upvotes? 
---
Because he saw content like this getting downvoted?
---
Easy answer.
---
Now I'm starting to doubt as well. I saw that question for sure, 100%... maybe it was while helping my friend in her personal story? But she was ahead of me with her own story, so it doesn't make sense that when I played my own story a little time later, the choice was gone. 
---
I also seem to remember thinking "ughh, again this largos??" when I was playing chapter 8, and the only way to have already met her is to have chosen "Make another suffer", as I recall I did.
---
Well this character of mine stopped his storyline before HoT, so he didn't even do that bad. Then again, I am sympathetic towards the dragons and Scarlet, so maybe it was about time for some NPC to find out and start hating!
---
Race is all about personal preference, aesthetics, animations, voices, and general flavor. 
---
I personally went with mostly humans because I'm more comfortable with their looks and animations. On the other hand, they can become boring and stale.
---
Norn, who are like big humans, feel off to me. Maybe because despite their size they travel at the same speed as all other races, so they look slow. 
---
I also have an Asura cosplay character that I love. Asura have some really neat animations, and I consider their small stature to be a boon in various situations, such as jumping puzzles.
---
Charr are awesome,  but there are a couple drawbacks that keep me from having a Charr main. Their tails clip through everything, even armor designed for them. They run on all fours yet cover ground at the same speed as anyone else, so it looks weird.
---
Sylvari are plant people. They can look pretty good, especially when you take advantage of their glowy features. They have my favorite dancing animation. Lore-wise, they're probably the most connected to the main story until PoF. But IDK I could never bring myself to make one.
---
I've seen all races represented well, but you may find one particularly appealing to you.
---
For class, again this is down to preference but it has much more of a gameplay impact. You say you already have all of 'me so I expect you've tried them out and know the basics.
---
For my part, I prefer Guardian. I think Guardian is great in all game modes and can fill a variety of roles. Guardians have low health pools but make up for it with tons of active defenses. They can be geared for healing, support, power DPS, condi DPS, or as a hybrid DPS-support. They use a wide variety of weapons, depending on the build. I recommend trying it out if you haven't already.
---
Post on those posts not here. If I see a fire I report it to the Firebrigade, I certainly dont call my aunt in Munchen to report it....
---
Yeah, it was same with me and color slight color blindness don't help.
---
Yip, that is the thing that makes this post just come across as another attempt to stir up drama and community ire, which we've had enough of recently.
---
The first point listed on the ["what is next"](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/) page is;
---
&gt;The rune and sigil salvaging release last year was in anticipation of releasing legendary runes and sigils—the final components of legendary core equipment.
---
That is literally landing tomorrow.
---
What the community wanted was an idea of what was coming in the future of the game, not precise dates. We got that and, as far as we can see, Anet are starting to deliver on it.
---
woop woop woop!
---
Thanks!
---
The bug that affected Adina also impacted Deimos 10%, CA, AND open world bosses. Incredible.
---
meanwhile at other companys: real roadmaps, presentation on how far they are with fleshed out demos and a bit in depth development how certain things work or how they made functions more efficient so the games works smoother.  
---
...as usually done by companys which have a game as a service.  
---
but yeah, anet is oldschool, they can't keep up with new tech...hence the struggles with twitch, twitter, advertisement or the audience which is actually interested in their company as a whole and not just on how to gather ore for 10 mins on a map and press 1 meanwhile beccause some wolf attacked you.
---
you could gift me that exotic staff there...PM for ingame name ;-)
---
You seem to be a bit confused. The color thing was nothing more than a metaphor. It was never about dyes.
---
To quote myself in a less metaphorical post:
---
&gt; Here I prefer my high fantasy to have the majority be functional appearances over either "edgy" or "silly" stuff.
---
&gt; Sadly, it seems what I want is in the utmost minority and tends to be the blandest, low level stuff.
---
To clarify: "pink" = "silly"; "black" = "edgy"
---
Ye, I expect to get broader look to LS5 once actually LS5 arrives, so the point of talking about it is not one big spoiler. But alas, no help for others....
---
Just play scourge then, your heal skill provides barrier so you get that extra value even at 100% in a way.

---
Most likely, being the proud race they are.
---
Even better, information about LS5 might just come with the live event about Living Story. Maybe, just maybe.
---
I want to show off ALL my musclefluff.
---
&gt; we’re still a long way away
---
Based, I'm sure, on your inside knowledge of Arenanet's current development cycles.
---
What an useless news, just to repeat something they already said 1 week earlier. Communication on the event worst than ever, no idea if there is some new rewards or things.
---
Wasn't even thinking about material reacting to light. I was thinking about the posture of charr and how that design would literally float due to their hunched nature. Especially when straight-lined. It'd need various straps along the side to keep it against the charr's body.
---
But the clothing is not only taut, but up against the body, which clashes with the posture of the charr, thus becoming obviously placed on top.
---
Yes, that's what the little date on the title bar indicates.
---
Protoss, you will be a god
---
I have and I don't get your point
---
Yes, the beginning for all races to the end of the first End Boss (Elder Dragon) is legit awesome.
---
The designer said they had six. SIX OR NONE!
---
And if they gave us a roadmap, people would A) demand things be put on the roadmap that aren't and B) still demand things be implemented on their own schedule and not ANet's.
---
Without a roadmap, people complain. With a roadmap, people complain. It is a lose/lose situation for ANet.
---
cats have 8. Charr have 6, according to the designer.
---
Human Reaper. Best looking armors are on Humans as they're modeled based on them and Reaper is fun.
---
Remember when lupicus was the final boss of the game and could wipe an entire party of good players?
---
U can get 25k+ from farming. Just takes time x_x alot of it and defo a bit longer without istan around. Source:me. But sure, I'd never go back to farming after seeing how nice the tp is :&gt;
---
Nope
---
Try it.
---
&gt; when lupicus was the final boss of the game
---
he never was
---
or the later parts got removed after you did the part where she ask the question but before you got to the later step since there are quite a few steps in between
---
TIL people are still soloing Lupi
---
It's so funny, if I as a Designer gave vague answers to customers will no time tables, I would lose my job.
---
But here's the thing, for software companies, which game Devs are, the user is not the customer, the investors are. If the Investors call and ask for a detailed roadmap, they get it in spades. The user is still important of course, but don't drive the company to act. 
---
If the Investors notice their investment not doing well, it's not because players are unhappy but because players aren't paying.
---
Investors see players as Dollar Signs not people so they could care less if you're happy, as long as you dip into the premium shop.
---
warrior is probably of of the best starter class, guard is also a good option esp. the support firebrand is in high demand now for fractal and raids
---
The utilities it works with are things like Superior Sharoening Stones, etc.
---
Just grab the Candy Corn Gobbler when it rolls around again for Halloween
---
Mesmer because they're always shattering.
---
Charr warrior.
---
Can't post my char because there are infusions on him and im tired of people telling me to delete my char or kill myself just because i like infusions :)
---
Any fights that are literal dps golems like MO and Dhuum favor condi berserker because it brings the same banners and does wayyy more damage. There's so much CC floating around dps classes and support classes nowadays that having the extra CC almost doesn't matter besides Samarog/Sloth and fractals.
---
&gt; Part of the fun with FFXIV and Archeage was being able to see neighbouring houses and make friends/enemys with the people who own them.
---
I am not familiar with these games. How did it work? Was there limited amount of houses available or you could see new neughbours everytime you logged in since you joined different server?
---
Only useful at all because of a trait though.
---
in a nutshell, it doesn't matter which server you pick, unless you care about World vs World
---
I always played with condicleanse stuff on my heals, 100% works to get out of combat faster
---
I love how you open a discussion in a completely unbiased, non-shitstirring way. The account name really drives the point home, too ^/s
---
they're both sub which makes it even worse, as anet intended
---
You are allowed to speak about them. I've been speaking about them here, on the official forums and on Twitter for years (primarily issues with raid design, balance and release pace) and not once has someone deleted my post or banned me (or blocked me if Twitter).
---
However, the posts recently have been pretty ridiculous, not grounded in what is actually happening (the no content claim is a good example of this) and often filled with vitriol that just seems designed to rile people up.
---
Speak away about the problems, just try and not fall into the aggressive attacks that we've seen recently. People are likely a lot more willing to listen if you do it like that.
---
I've read it, it doesn't say. It just says that I talked to the Pale Tree. The point is that I'm 100% sure I've played through that "greatest fear" question (otherwise, how would I know about it?). So I think the options are 2: either I played through those steps and the (bugged?) journal doesn't show; or even when AN removed that part of the story, the Pale Tree would ask you that question anyway, even if nothing would change depending on the answer you give. In any case, I guess Ceera's dialogue with me is bugged
---
If you slap some glasses on him and color his hair, he'd look like he's likely to murder you for saying "Venice"
---
It's one of the few things both solo'able and worth solo'ing that is guaranteed not to have interruptions from other players.
---
hp not full = no extra damage from runes either
---
yes i know. still surprises me that people are still doing it \~7 years later
---
I'm not sure. In a way we're digging our graves. Some form of communication is still nice, rather than the PR talk as OP has mentioned. It's far too fluffy and vague.
---
Extending cooking to 500 is NOT content...
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
Hmmm, get the feeling you might have some bias against GW2. Don't know why though...
---
What was the point in this post? They just copy pasted what they said last time but they've somehow said even less. This would've been the perfect opportunity to showcase what rewards are coming.
---
Always solid advice.
---
The story of guild wars original is about maintaining ones humanity even in the face of adversity .

Guild  Wars 2 aka Gemstone story is about a bunch of Dragons that have a tummy  ache that know how to cure themselves without killing millions of  people over many generations , but instead kill millions of people over  many generations . Also eating magic causes the dragons pain . And when   glint the ex- champion of Kralkatorrik does exactly what  he knows he  has to do he kills Glint Because She Betrayed Him .
---
Guild Wars Original has a dialog line " Are you so lost in your hatred that your willing to die for it ,, Master Togo .
---
Guild  Wars 2 has a Dialog line " It is corruption , but it's not corruption  ,, Caithethe the  second abused  lesbian in guild wars 2 .

Which Story Is Better ?
---
How are we allowed to speak about problems without the "positivity bubble" gang jumping and downvoting everything this instant? And when we finally manage to get more support, it's suddenly "upvote manipulation and coordinated effort".
---
Apparently going to try out Classic WoW because of the lack of a sense of community and multilayer content in Guild Wars 2. Which shows Teapot never played vanilla or TBC and enjoyed the amazing community feeling of trying to solo gather materials or farm mobs at silly o'clock in the morning to reduce competition with others. All so that you could spend a few hours in the evening wiping on the same raid boss repeatedly because people won't do mechanics.
---
Maybe you'll get downvoted for how you put it... But I agree. I rarely play games for the story and when it comes to mmorpgs, I straight up ignore it. But I loved gw1 story. From the first second it felt so immersive and "real" it just caught my attention. Pre searing ascalon was beautiful, you felt the peace of a - still - peaceful land but there was clearly something bigger coming. After the charr invasion, the world drastically changed, the atmosphere way heavier and darker, the missions were no longer "help people dealing with wasps" or bring x item to y npc but "kill charrs", "bury this person" "retrieve this body". Same for factions and nightfall.
---
I've tried to enjoy gw2 story from different races perspectives but I just can't. The story is boring, most characters are bland and pathetic, the pattern is always the same - we gotta kill dragon hurr durr -.
---
Truly a shame, but the lore and the world building make up for the trash story I guess, talking with people and being exploring is still a great feeling
---
Yes, I think it's cool though.  Lupi + HoT map metas + some fractals show ANet is at least sometimes capable of making replayable content.
---
&gt; Is GW2 worth playing in 2019 compared to other mmorpgs that are current or upcoming?
---
Who the fuck knows..
---
Idk I don't follow his streams, but there were some people talking about him leaving in reddit
---
No seriously, look at her [it's the perfect match](https://imgur.com/a/zciJTFw)
---
Thanks, very insightful input, 10/10 would ask again.
---
No, I won’t claim to have any “inside knowledge,” but I also have no reason to believe Alliances will come anytime “soon.” And I do believe they themselves have said there’s still a lot of work to be done as well.
---
Well, GW2 doesn't have a sub fee... So, since you already have the expansions, your criteria of not having the money to play more than one of them doesn't apply to GW2 quite as much. 
---
Honestly, if you have friends playing another game, you'll have a better time joining with them regardless of which game they choose to play - having people to play with can make even the worst MMO feel great, and not having people can ruin the best ones. So, either follow them, or try to find friends in GW2 by joining a guild or something! :)
---
Honestly, my suggestion would be to just try GW2 for now (since it's free.) Then, even if you decide you prefer the others, you can keep GW2 on the side for when the other game's servers are down for maintenance, or you just need a break! :D
---
(PS: Between the other options, I highly suggest FFXIV over WoW.)
---
Here comes back another doomkiddo.
---
I don't think we ever got a roadmap. But hey, here we are, in an 7yo mmo that is sub free and without any roadmaps ever is very alive, full of players and being updated with new content every 3 months. 
---
Does WoW have roadmap? ESO? Nothing more than us, announcement no more than month before to keep us surprised. Because it's story driven, ls also should not be announced too early.
---
You could give it a light try right now and see how you like the core mechanics of the game.
---
I'd wait until their "big" announcement August 30th to invest more on the game though.
---
They told us we will get info on the live event. So i will wait until then. I am sure they understand by now that we are unhappy that they do not talk to us. And will there for have enough info for us during this event. If not then i will sign your post, but for now i think we have to wait until this event and see what season 5 means for them and were it lead us in to the future.
---
Are there any viable elementalist builds?
---
what kind of player are you? hardcore which will be there ready to raid in 1 month and done all the raids in 2 months or the one who takes it slow and enjoys all kind of content?  
---
what about playstyle? more action packed playstyle like darksouls where you dodge, duck dip and dodge or rather the dude which only moves from time to time when needed and just pressing some skills (like gw1 or any other mmo with global cooldowns)?  
---
because gw2 is definitly worth it, but it kinda depends on what you really want.
---
&gt;I would lose my job.
---
If by customers you mean investors and professional clients with clear demands and deadlines, sure. No game designer has ever lost his job from not sharing a roadmap with its playerbase, though.
---
I honestly think this community feel entitled because ANET is a pretty nice and lighthearted developer, but in reality there's no obligation or even need to share a roadmap with players. In fact, the vast majority of game companies don't, and I wish people in here would realize that. ANET doesn't owe us anything except providing a fun game and good service, and while the silence during content droughts never helped, Aug 30th announcement shows they have been working on something for a while and chose not to share it with us on purpose. It's their way of doing things.
---
Great post that Glassdoor was eye opening. It seems like a leadership and organizational behavior issue. I think that’s the hardest to fix actually unless there’s a big shakeup internally. I think us players can do little to solve this problem. Damn!
---
I generally don't say anything at the start unless it is about who goes home, oro how we split. I do sometimes just for fun think about saying "hi guys, sorry haven't played in years, is this WvW?
---
It certainly is a fashion crisis.
---
necromancer with 6 minions lol, imagine having to use your utilities lmao
---
You can see the percentage on the normal reddit website in the bottom right corner of the post
---
*looks at calendar ....ye, it is 2019.....*  I guess yes then? Or what you want to wait for? 
---
Considering your other picks, I would still find GW2 as most "mmo" of them all, WoW is usually most of maps empty, FF14 is pretty much huge story simulator, which is not usually stuff with many players around as well. However, this can be mitigated *for a while* as FF14 got new content recently (but honestly, you need weeks to months of story grinding to get to the stuff everyone is at - or buy skip, which neutralizes the story enjoyment...), and WoW gets classic which will be played by many people....for probably not too long, as it is just recycled content, with zero chance to get *anything* new. So once the novelty diminishes, it will probably be same as normal WoW - dead except some newest zones.
---
So...Gw2 still offers good pick as we are anticipating to get new stuff in august/september as well. Festival of Four Winds arrives tomorrow and will have maps full of players, guaranteed. First expansion has brutal focus on group play along the maps. All you really have to do - aproach other players a bit. Maybe talk in chat, make groups for meta, or hero points...people are talkative and even randoms can be good companions for evening. Sometimes it just takes tiny sparkle. But this is true for all those games.
---
So ultimatively, it is not bad to just play them all. FF14 has a month of "trial" - basically free subscription for a month, but if you aren'T invested there yet, you might not enjoy it as leveling is totally tedious and everyone is already on new juicy stuff. WoWC will have best thrill just on launch, but might die out quickly, so if you want to experience it, go for it, but you will need subscription. Gw2 will be there all the time patiently waiting, with people still playing and doing stuff.
---
Well, you should actually expect it even more after the layoffs. You need to give an image of prosperity after such an ordeal.
---
TL;DR: "Let me ask you a question which I don't care how you answer because I'm totally biased and just a troll throwaway and I hate the game. My life is so miserable, I have to hate it publicly on reddit."
---
True. I'd rather have to deal with micro-transactions than a sub fee, honestly. I'd don't want to buy the game + expansions, just to be required to pay monthly or in 3-6-12 month intervals, but I've done it before since the content was worth it.
---
&gt; Does WoW have roadmap? ESO? Nothing more than us, announcement no more than month before to keep us surprised. Because it's story driven, ls also should not be announced too early.
---
They do, and with quite a lot of information.
---
Inform yourself before spreading bullshit.
---
I don't personally care that much if someone brings Condi into my CM runs, but...it's definitely not ideal. You won't hit your peak damage in the time that a boss gets bursted down to their next phase in Fractals usually (40k+ bursts per DPS class easily). 
---
And no one should be going (fully) down in CMs tbh.
---
Sometimes it happens, but it's usually from one-shots in my experience. Maybe Mirage would last longer in those scenarios, but I'd feel like it's a pretty bad group if a condi mirage is ever the last man standing.
---
Yeah if you can "catch" them theyll melt (kinda) but the problem is exactly that, catching them. So annoying when theyre invi 99.9% of the time even stealth ressing everyone (esp reaaally good thief that knows whats he doing).
---
Well mesmer too would waste a utility if they carry portal when its not needed but thats not the problem. Its the very fact that thief CAN do it now, should the situations calls for it. They dont have to carry the portal, but they have the OPTIONS to change to it if its needed. Thats the problem. And their portal doesnt even have sound like mesmer's and it even grant stealth. *intense squint*. Id hate to fight one but id love to have one as an addition to party when havoc-ing.
---
And yeah soulbeast is..soulbeast. with that longbow. Fighting from afar. Anet should make longbows usable for necros. I very much want to pew pew from distance as well. Mid range sucks.
---
Dont worry, i dont do evil. I play zerging class only. (Actually im just too sucky to play these classess - or any class- up to their potential, id be that person that died to nothing...even if i have permastealth)
---
Wonderful! Thanks for the update.
---
lets make it simple, [if you enjoy such a playstyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrhyKnzARM0), you can have that in gw2 and a lot (or not) training depending on how fast you learn.  
---
if you are not a altoholic you will likely come to a point in 1-2 years where you ask yourself: new content?!  
---
other pro's: story has gotten a lot better then the base game (cinematic wise) only downside is, its so easy to the point that you can't die in certain missions.  
---
a lot to do if you enjoy alts and different playstyles (and maybe fashion?).  
---
but if you are a solo player, be mindful in terms of when you want to get into teamcontent. while most people are generaly nice and there are a lot of helpful people...pugging can be dreadful.  
---
...you will have the same amount of people being like: i play how i want, you can't tell me to play in a team (those are usually get kicked really fast).
---
The idea of Entitlement aside, I think that everyone wants the same thing, Gamers want a good game to play, Game Devs want gamers to enjoy their game, and Investors want gamers to play the game and spend money as long as possible.
---
How this is perceived by each group are often different, I'm glad I don't work in Game Development, there's too many opinions on what's right and wrong, too much or too little. I get a project, I do the project, I get paid and move on to the next project. Right now, customers of my clients are not jumping down my throat for my designs, in their eyes I don't exist, only the client exists to them.
---
Many gamers don't realize the pressure of design in general, game design in particular is often a thankless job, you can be responsible for the best aspect of a game and if something else is bad, your work gets overshadowed by shit.
---
Your post is right, but you make a mistake: Those fanboys don't act on a rational basis. They have to defend the game and the company, period. Being right or wrong is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is the moral high ground.
---
While I'm personally not a fan of basing arguments around Glassdoor, the rest of your discussion is really good and definitely worth contemplating, even if it isn't the direct cause of the problems.
---
Always nice to read a well considered post. Enjoy your upvote, hopefully this gets some good traction and decent responses.
---
I'm not going to add a huge amount since it is late, but I always felt the game direction was a little more solid when Mike was in the lead game designer position and much more shaky when at the very top. That might indeed point to an oversight and bottleneck problem as when Mike had the lead designer role too it was one less person potentially blocking things.
---
As a counterpoint, its worth noting that this behaviour isn't consistent or endemic. If it was, a personal side project like Super Adventure Box likely wouldn't have been possible in the company, never mind released as major content.
---
PoE does the best job with this, because they aren't "consumed" you just use some of it each time, and it refills as you kill enemies.
---
The only way to really enjoy the game mode anymore is to find a group of people you want to play with. 
---
Finding a guild to run with is the best thing you can do if you want to play wvw. I have been part of many guilds over the years. Some can be pretty toxic, that is the reality in a competitive game mode. Some, however, can be really really chill and extremely skilled at the same time. It is all about finding the right guild.
---
Also, it has been said already but you will be excepted to run meta class and build if you're gonna run with a "fight focused" guild.
---
Hey man, don't be entitled. We're getting an announcement on upcoming content in 1 month. It's only been 2 months since Dragonfall.
---
All right I’ll check out metabattle for hammer herald, pull my herald off his farming spot and start looking for groups.
---
I bet you don’t use the LFG tool for that though.  How do you find a group in WvW?  (Maybe I disabled a setting that allows me to see friendly dots?)
---
I was hyped for classic WoW, to be honest, but now I'm unsure, so I'm weighing other things to scratch my mmorpg itch. I've been heavily looking at PvP or hardcore raiding recently, but since I've done neither of those in GW2 or FFXIV, I'm currently just wanting the general experience. Maybe in GW2 I might learn one of the two, if there's a decent scene for it.
---
Im more curious in your pc specs. It seems to be running wvw bloberones really well.
---
They put way too much emphasis on art in general. This is a game first, and thus, gameplay is the most important element.
---
Lol yeah so many posts like "does anybody else think the game is getting stale? " and than say they've been playing over 5000 hours over 5 years.
---
Friendliest community btw.
---
what an ADORABLE asura!!!! i dont see too many heavy armor asuras that manage to pull it off in a cute way, so DANG thats good
---
Gold has no value in this game because you can not buy anything aside from skins/quality of life stuff. So stop thinking about it and spend it on whatever.
---
Trust me, I learn quickly and I get how pugging can be terrible. I was a hardcore raider on WoW for a few years in one of the expansions, as well as a hardcore PvPer at times. Learning quickly was rewarded lol. 
---
A small flex but I was in one of the top raiding guilds on my server, at that time. Then I quit, the guild died and well, here I am.

Tfw he still does fuck good players very easily in casual runs. Pretty much all of his attacks are close to 1hit KOs, and there is a lot of RNG involved in his attack patterns so it's nothing unusual to get downed somehow.
---
Immob tempest is pretty decent. Maybe 1 per 15 players.
---
Staff weaver DPS is still good, too.
---
I do it and a lot of others do it on a pretty regular basis, it's always been a fun boss to test classes with after a balance update honestly.
---
Lmao &gt;.&lt;
---
What server are you on? That will dictate a lot of your experience.

I didn't have a chance earlier to reply. Thank you very much for this. So many tidbits that are getting connected together and I also never expected this post to get like any traction. Have a great day!!

As far as I'm aware he just wants to play some WoW Classic and people immediately assumed that he's going to uninstall GW2 forever and hate it now.

At least you get that 5% back lol. My issue is that sometimes the sand color of barrier looks like lost health to me instead and I'll instinctively pop an extremely useless heal.
---
That's just nonesense?
---
The resources required to develop that would be better spent elsewhere in the game.  Not to mention there are several raids that are very simple.  I've been participating in a weekly raid training run for over a year.  With people that have exotic gear you can still easily run through several encounters.  People say they would raid if there was an easy mode.  They would do it once, then move on.  If you want to try raids, then simply look for a raid training run and give it a try.
---
Oh boy, I'd hate to have to do that. Unfortunate that you picked exactly that answer
---
Wrong thread?
---
Yes. This is Guild Wars 2's golden age. I would go into this game with the mindset of trying out as many things as possible. The game rewards you for playing different classes, different game modes, different content. You have a truly insane amount of stuff to do, collect, achieve, and find. You can also just grind your favorite content endlessly if you want to.
---
I am new to GW2, have only been playing a couple of months. What exactly is this all about? How come they don't tell us what and where and when it is? Or is it not something players participate in? Is it something only to watch? Kinda confused.....
---
I actually preferred mallyx before the last balance patch for power builds. However the changes to elite have killed it for power.
---
the pale tree will ask you that question regardless of whether that part of the story was enabled or not.
---
I'm not gonna defend Anet since I haven't played in a month, but this last month has gotten loud. People are legit treating Anet like it is Bioware, and it's not the same. This game isn't close to the shithole anthem was, and I own Anthem. But there isn't a sliver of dialogue in the community, just two factions pissing into the wind.
---
WP literally made a video yesterday saying that all the uproar is just noise, and this isn't even close to the worst it's ever been. Remember post HoT??? Anyone??? That was worse.

One example is how the chatter from NPCs in Amnoon varies depending on who you decide to support.  The tech was used a lot more in PoF and onwards, it seems like.

I did get it.  Had to actually use the Choya and mimic the inner ring of dancers.  wiki says to transform back to your toon and type /dance.  Wiki's instructions did not work.

i miss dungeon tours and guilds that would require you to know how to speed run to join

They've given us three full armour sets for each weight, I don't think that's a stretch.
---
I always get stuff like that just on my middle screen, it's always been a bit wonky with 3 screens (my glider endurance bar is almost always on my right screen totally out of sync with the rest of the UI for example)
---
Yea, I was going to bring up draining structures that are about to be lost but forgot. It's also why I usually put Sabotage Depot for the southern towers.  It's also a good point for not keeping the keeps at 100% as well.  
---
The classic example of tension I usually think of is at SMC where the outer walls are always bound to be open but people that don't know any better keep trying to repair them.
---
&gt; Was there limited amount of houses available or you could see new neughbours everytime you logged in since you joined different server?
---
The number of houses (or rather of land plots) is limited - if all of them are occupied on your server, you have to wait for one to be freed. An, by the way, and you cannot "join" different server in FFXIV (except when by doing paid transfer - but your house will remain on old server anyway)
---
They are all so sexy.
---
What's the deal with the negativ comments? Just a reminder for their stream.
---
&gt; Which ones do I go for and why?
---
The ones that look interesting to you. The leveling experience is there to help you figure out your own character, and see what kinds of things you like. 
---
Common choices for learning necromancer are signets and minions, since they're the most passive of skills. 
---
Signets are just skills that give a passive effect, and they can be activated for another effect on a cool down.
---
Minions are summoned AI allies that can tank and deal damage for you. They also come with an active skill on a cool down, but other than that, they are pretty much independently following you
---
But again, choose whatever you think looks cool, and see if you like it. You end up unlocking everything by max level anyways, so go crazy. And with that...
---
&gt; And are they resetable?
---
Yes. Anytime you're out of combat, you can choose different skills, as long as you have them unlocked. The same applies for traits (specializations), which you unlock I believe at around level 20 (21?)
---
Yes. Good.
---
You created Thomas Gottschalk
---
Honestly it all comes down to preference. I like using my mouse because I have very short fingers (lol) and so it's hard for me to reach. I use a Logitech G600 which I got on deal, otherwise idk those mouses are kind of expensive otherwise.
---
I mean there are a lot of things in life that all of us are doing purely for the outcome... I don't exactly have fun going to work every weekday but I do it anyways because having disposable income and money to pay for the living standards I am used to makes me feel happy. Same concept can be applicable to watching a show or a movie or playing a game. You don't always like every single thing you do, but sometimes you want to see the end of it so you put up with it for a bit. I'm not sure why this concept is so lost on you.
---
Wrong , that's exactly when they should do it. To reassure the community about the direction the game is going. Because it's not like the lay-offs were kept secret. At that point , you need to reassure users that your product will continue at the same quality , or improve.
---
If I am on ele legit like first time I get hit I punch that heel skill😂😂
---
&gt; I have yet to touch the end game PvE or PvP. And I'm not sure if I should or if it's worth it at this point
---
Wait till August 30th and gauge the hype for LS5/new expansion.
---
GW2 is currently in an awkward state where it feels like the devs have abandoned the hardcore playerbase since 2017. Since then we've only had one raid per year, and we have no confirmation ANET will continue to support the game mode.
---
However, if it turns out they've been working on things in the background in all this time, then that would be pretty hype.
---
Wait 'till August 30th.
---
go Renegade and take Righteous Rebel and use Breakrazor's Bastion whenever you get condi-bombed.  35%+50% in condi dmg reduction (I don't know if the percents stacks additively or not but it's still pretty strong)
---
enough with the housing already! no no no.
---
The one from April? It wasn’t a roadmap.
---
What's the best solo farm for gold (not requiring a squad)? Looking for something to do past midnight when things are usually quiet on EU servers, no squads for SW/DF etc, anyone got any ideas?
---
I invested some time in a second account-- no expansions, no masteries. It's actually proven really refreshing to go back to running everywhere by foot and take the time to really *experience* the world again. It's definitely something I've stopped doing as much with mounts.
---
@OP, starting from the beginning is a great idea, even for people who have played this game for years.
---
Sure it’s an armor set. To call it an expansion feature is a stretch. That’s like saying adding NPCs to fight would be expansion content.
---
I'm gonna tell you why you should NOT play this game, nothing in GW2 will give you the feeling of dropping a Glob of Ectoplasm like in GW.
---
Exactly
---
For a second I thought you just linked week old news lol
---
Comprehensively:
---
* Bank Access, Merchant, TP express are all worthless if you keep telling yourself to save them up. Just throw them on your main and use them till they're gone.
---
* Boosters are the same. Start with the lowest duration ones and just use them in your day-to-day. They will maintain duration even if you log out, so don't worry about "losing" some of that time.
---
* Auto-levelups are great for keyfarming. If you have a spare character slot and like opening Black Lion Chests, definitely give that a shot. Otherwise, I'd definitely chuck the lower level ones.
---
* Tomes of Knowledge are the same schtick--if you ever expect to make another character and want to gear them out in lvl80 gear asap, save them. Otherwise use them; each level you get above 80 gives you a Spirit Shard.
---
* Revive Orbs are pretty decent, because they can let you cheese hard Jumping Puzzles provided you have a Gryphon. Fly high above the chest at the end, when you get dismounted fall onto it, revive orb and voila. This can skip things like Not So Secret, aka the JP from hell.
---
* Toss the Master's Salvage Kit, or better yet craft a Mystic Salvage Kit at the Mystic Forge. The Mystic kit is THE kit to use on any Rare (yellow) or Exotic (orange) gear. It's a recipe most endgame players have memorized.
---
* The Mystic Forge stones are used to make Mystic Salvage Kits, keep them.
---
* Black Lion Claim Ticket Scraps and Black Lion Statuettes are decent to toss onto an alt with spare inventory space. Eventually you can save up enough to get something cool, like Complete Makeover Kits (which have all the cool hair options).
---
* Black Lion Salvage Kit, use, it's basically a better Mystic Salvage Kit.
---
* The exotic Scepter (I think?) can be salvaged or used.
---
* Ellen Kiel, right click, save to wardrobe. Chuck the rest.
---
* The other stacks or piles of things IDK what they are.
---
A few members on this sub has salt in their veins. If Anet posts anything that isn't news on future updates/content people lose their mind. I know people are upset but they're just flat out trolling at this point. Would be nice if the mods dished out some suspensions to curb the trolling.
---
Stupidity is not a bannable offense.
---
For an elite spec to "outclass core" it just has to be the *third* best trait line for a given build. Look at power Dragonhunter for example. Zeal and Radiance aren't outclassed by Dragonhunter at all. All Dragonhunter has to do to outclass core Guardian in a power DPS role is... Be better than *Virtues* for DPS.
---
I agree.

No. ANet has proven that they have no sense of reasonable story progression. They'd be like, oooh here's a cryptic hint and then SURPRISE IT WAS BALTHAZAR and I'd only be shocked they broke their own lore's back yet again.

People also need to remember that GW2's armor is lightyears ahead of, for example, WoW's armor. WoW is a "generation" behind and doesn't have fully modeled out armor, normal maps, special specularity, dyes, etc. Instead they're mostly texture swaps. GW2's armor really actually does take longer to make.
---
no, it's meant to inform others, like a PSA

Now chronos use it because Distortion was lolnurfed.

cpu matters a lot, but not the amount of cores. you want high single-core performance/IPC

My advice would be to have a look at the current hybrid builds that exist for firebrand, warrior/berserker and renegade. You will not be the highest dps but you can bring vital boons and utility and stabilize runs that might otherwise be very messy - especially when pugging.
---
Moreover, I think the teamplay aspect is the best part of fractals - 
---
saving your group from a nasty attack with aegis or disabling entire packs with daze chains while keeping your party alive with life steal is pretty fun.
---
DPS is also fun but it will make your pug experience a lot more volatile because you will depend more on your team being decent and playing a healer character is pretty superfluous in low tier fractals (albeit I'd recommend it for t3-4 casual pugs who just want smooth sailing).
---
Okey cool. Maybe write less so I could read it.

Solo farming in open world events will require very strong builds that can mitigate damage and output decent amount of damage to maintain momentum.  A channel I highly recommend to check out is Boot's Bad Builds on YouTube (recent scrapper and scourge minion build can handle anything).  Vanpyrism runes also makes many of the classes ridiculously strong for clearing out large group of mobs while maintaining strong dmg gear.

As for the farms, it really depends on what you're needing gold for.  If you intend to make legendaries, the ls3 and ls4 dailies is your best guide everyday as the dailies of each zone focuses on 2 solo events and 2 group events.  Normally solo currency farmers will have a higher foot traffic associated with the dailies and the dalies will rotate the objectives everyday.  You can use the currencies of each map to progress your achievements, ascended trinkets, or make gold via trophy boxes.  It is also very important to max your masteries for the region as it converts all exp you earn into spirit shards, an essential ingredient to promote low tier mats and pushing out legendaries.  Karma also can be boosted per map by investing into permanent upgrades, which is also essential for legendaries and map farming if you are into festivals, pof mat boxes and volatile tools for harvesting (more map currencies).

They have been doing this for a very very long time.

These are all amazing

I wonder what humans would get, if not generic plain trunks and bikinis

*lists a multitude of quality-of-life character selection features that other MMOs have and are basically common industry standards.*

&gt;I would prefer if swimwear was a customization that replaces the default underwear rather than outfits.
---
I understand where you're coming from. But having played crap like Black Desert Online and Vindictus where you can pay a tenner to put your female characters in Lingerie I hope that ArenaNet isn't going to touch that entire zone with a ten foot pole
---
You mean heal over time? A lot of MMOs that do potions have an instant version and a HoT version (that's typically stronger than instant but heals slowly).
---
Vision doesn't require Dances with Cacti achievement, but actual intended participation in the event.
---
HAH

Back when Anthem came out I was often called a White Knight or Shill purely based on being hopeful that Bioware was doing things. Not everyone is "White Knighting" they just have much more patience. There are those that do, but they're more of a hivemind.
---
Except that isnt true. Its never been 100% consistent.
