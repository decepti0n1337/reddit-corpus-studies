Sometimes I think Anet has an identity disorder. Like they cant figure out if they want to be taken seriously or just be completely goofy. I feel like they try to do both simultaneously which ruins it. Like you can spend all this time creating your fashionwars^tm and looking super sick fantasy character... and somebody flies by on there stuffed pig balloon wearing a t-shirt sunglasses and shorts...It kills immersion. I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but its irritating sometimes.

I don't play pvp.
---
Oh please let the wings NOT have floating hearts. 
---
If you're in a squad, usually right after vinewrath boss (end of the meta) the squads do a chest train. Someone usually has the shovels and knows where to find the chests. You can just follow the commander who will usually mark locations of the chests. 
---
Then fuck off my post lol

[Should've used a Pink Floyd pig](http://sparebricks.fika.org/sbzine20/images/pig1980.jpg)
---
Doesn't prove anything?
---

---
Arah and TA paths still take 14~15 minutes each to complete, which amounts to 30~45 minutes per path just for whatever subpar rewards.
---
SE P1 and CoF P1 are all fractal length runs.
---
Just because people can do it means it is efficient and rewarding.
---
Fun, sure, but if the goal is money, other players rather be doing something else than spend that time doing dungeons for money, unless yur new and want some gold doing Dungeon achivements. 
---
hello, i have a bit of 1.2k on eso with max cp and id say only about maybe 400 hours in gw2.
---
in eso, combat for me is a lot more easy to understand, pvp fights tend to be a sustain game as there are no cds on basic abilities, you mainly manage your resources, pressure the enemy, and blow them up after cc'ing them. in gw2, i am complete ass, a lot of knowledge needs to be known for fighting classes and combo fields and what not. i dont think combat in eso is slow, it seems to be up there for fast pace as combat requires a lot of cancel animations. I think however, compared to gw2 and a lot of other mmos, the abilities are a lot more plain, no crazy explosions, no crazy sword swings, etc. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i also wish gw2 runs as well as eso, i have a pretty decent setup (6700k,1070ti,ssd,16gb ram) and eso runs way better than gw2 in wvw, and large scale stuff. that being said in huge scales they both go below 60 fps and theres not a lot of mmos that can handle that either. Gw2 meta events and exploration is hands down one of the most pve friendly environments and i love it a whole lot better than other mmos. eso falls slightly behind it, though it is still great with quests scattered across the lands and lorebooks/skyshards to collect, imo its the best rpg out of the mmorpgs out there. 
---
oh and damn gw2 mounts are freaking amazing and there is no mmo out there like it
---
i don't think there's any benefit to leveling that way because exp is more or less scaled to your level so that you still gain relevant exp even when you are a level 60 on a level 1-15 map.  that being said there's nothing preventing you from doing any heart you want no matter the level, i tend to move to the next map at level 12 or so.  most hearts have alternate ways of completing them if you don't want to just kill stuff.  the point of hearts is to give suggested areas to explore on the map and provide some kind of objective to do along the way.
---
the first 30 or so levels is mainly to get you familiar with things (basic combat, equipment, skills, specializations, etc) and those first levels can go rather fast especially if you are doing things as a group and doing world events when there are a lot of people running about.  Builds start to open up and become relevant around 45 when you unlock your second specialization slot.
---
You already deleted it.
---
The last one was incorrect, so I removed it. I felt the response of saying "my bad" was fine to leave up?
---
Definitely try both at least a little bit. They play differently and you may end up liking one's playstyle a lot more than the others'. 
---
From personal experience:
---
* Warrior is much better at sustaining outnumbered fights and also running/disengaging over long distances. It's a much more consistent roamer, and has access to good dps as well as plenty of defensive options.
---
* Revenant has much better burst which makes it a force to be reckoned with in duels or smaller scale fights. It has some glaring weaknesses though, namely that if you run the typical power glint/herald build, your heal skill can be gimped by an opponent who expects it.
---
All you rich people and your massive gold amounts. TEACH ME HOW TO BE RICH. Damn 1%ers
---
This guy just keeps justify being a dick out of nowhere lol. He just doesn't get it. NO ONE CARES IF YOU ARE COUNTER TO THEIR VIEW POINT. THEY CARE ABOUT HOW YOU ACT LIKE AN ASS TO ANYONE COUNTER TO YOU. Don't be a moron. Do you even listen to yourself and how much of an ass you sound like? This aggression towards you isn't coming out of nowhere. You were the first shit flinger so you get shit throw back at you. Ever hear of the golden rule?
---
Go to any of the crafting stations and click the wardrobe. Then you can sort by weight class etc
---
Kinda, not really, but that never bothered me.
---
The reason you recieved so much hate was ARE THESE PATCH NOTES A JOKE? The balance team has nothing to do with gemstore updates, which also happen EVERY Tuesday. Sure, the balance team is a bit slow, but releasing a balance patch before the tournament this weekend (which, from what I've seen on reddit, no once cares about. No spectator mode after 6.5 years lol) wouldn't be a good idea because players should not adapt to new builds in such a short time frame.
---
Note: You can preview it at any bank vendor as well
---
Problem with firebrand as a healer is that healing book is locked behind huge secondary cooldown (thank you, wvw, I guess), so it's a bit more difficult to play than druid. Healing revenant seems better, and generally quickbrand+renegade for heals is best for fractals (as Chrono got fucked pretty hard for non-raid boon situation -- trying to hit pugs with shield or have them stand on well when every major new instability basically screws with your movement or one-shotting for standing in the wrong place... Good luck with that) but requires _two_ competent player. As usual, all the "necessary nerfs" just make life worse for average pugs and mildly inconvenience static groups. 
---
I miss old SOI :( could have at least give it "share 5s of quickness+alacrity" in addition to "extend boon duration" so fractal pug groups wouldn't suffer too much.
---
The Crown's Pavillion only released a year after launch though. 
---
Watch the ledges
---
Finally, mindless map completion is possible! For someone who has done this 16 times, now I can stomach it for a few more!
---
Yup in fractals you want to go D/D D/P or straight up daredevil DD/Staff.
---
Lol ur pissed keep it coming 
---
You give yourself too much credit.  Sincerely.  
---
I'm a Plat 2 Mirage player and I have to say that I often have a hard time dealing with some warriors. I don't know if it's just me but for real...warriors are pissing me off 😃
---
 "This is why till this day, Dungeons remain unable to be solo'd "  Do you legit even think before you write
---
Google "gw2 light armor asura" , or "gw2 heavy armor charr" for all armor sets
---
People usually mix and match armor from these sets
---
For un-mixandmatch-able armor, search "gw2 outfits"
---
Slippery pit maze/voice fight...
---
I can only imagine...
---
I found that keeping myself reasonably geared within current level to be a bit of a task in ESO. I didn't find the crafting to be any easier...low number of material nodes per map instance, and it seemed that the nodes changed with my own level, providing me with materials that I couldn't yet use and overwhelming my bank. The only way I could then get the needed materials would be to create an alt, or take the time to trade with other people because the game lacks a trading post/ auction house system that automates the process. 
---
so, in 2020?
---
&gt; reflecting without giving up too much damage and boonrip is something a normal warrior or berserker definitly can't do.
---
&gt; same goes to increased survivability through an extra block.
---
That's like saying "I'll saw off my legs so I can fit through short doors easier."
---
I mean sure, yeah, you definitely will fit through short doors easier, but the tradeoff doesen't seem to be worth it.
---
&gt;a warrior not being spellbreaker in the right fractals is an insta kick.
---
No.
---
&gt;not that it matters much in openworld, where you can steamroll through anything anyway since most mobs die in 2-3 hits if they are not a oneshot. but missing spellbreaker in pve would be a pain now that we got it.
---
it indeed adds needed versatility to the class.
---
The thing is, spellbreaker is completely worthless in PvE and ads nothing of value to it.
---
Spellbreakers traits are focused on localized 1v1, his abilities are focused on localized 1v1 and his weapons are focused on localized 1v1.
---
No PvE gamemode is about localized 1v1.
---
In raids you also have to use your ears. There are mechancis that make specific sounds like the Vale Guardian teleport, Sabetha bombs and since a few days Largos bubbles.
---
You mean region.
---
2 - What they did with Dry Top just on a bigger scale would be cool! Opening up the map in fragments, keeping the attention of more people. 
---
Dungeons are usually run by experienced people. I'd recommend fractals.
---
Voice out that you're new, or look for newbie groups running Tier 1 fractals. People are generally quite chill because everyone is lousy and you muddle through it together!
---
You're in for a looooooooooooong wait, so you better spend those points on what you already got.
---
After season 4, we're not getting a new expact, we're getting season 5.
---
So, absolute best case scenario, new classes are 1.5 years away minimum.
---
Two possibilities. Guy is either standing on stilts, or there is a very unfortunate strong man holding him up
---
Ah, to be young and hopeful...
---
mOsT pOwErFuL cLaSs
---
FFXIV's effects are crazy, but you can turn off many things modularly whereas gw2 is always over the top, and has tons of circles I'd rather turn off/on in certain situations. 
---
Give us control over this stuff please.
---
I'm already max level human reaper with everything unlocked on my PoF main. I have 311 hero points on that character and i dont want to spend them unlocking scourge since i have an asura scourge already..so im just sitting on them waiting
---
Not only that but whenever they do add another set of elites they're gonna add more than enough HPs to unlock it all with the new expac's content.
---
What did we do to deserve you. Thank you!
---
Implying they exist. *laughs in stealth*
---
I think we are getting an xpack this year
---
That is pretty neat!
---
missed opportunity for a "Love Seat" which lets you sit on a charr that is squatting.
---
There's another that gathers an extra time too, forgot which though.
---
Interesting well I was worried it wouldnt be any point in melee since ele has no defense really, so I just want to know if I can truly melee and cast you know?
---
One of 3 skimmer races in the game, and excellently done. : 3
---
The next one isn't set in Cantha. It's set in space, and we get exosuits as masteries, and for some reason Matt Damon shows up at the time. The soundtrack is stellar.
---
Afaik they're a team of 2 or 3. But yeah they're amazing. :)
---
Interesting, I thought they were just doing bug fixes on GW1 and no feature/functionality updates.
---
That feeling when GW1 Patchnotes are longer than the ones for GW2 on the same day...
---
/s
---
Nope, we're going straight from Season 4 to Season 5.
---
DESPACITO 2 WILL BE DELAYED
---
Would have never realized without the Family Guy title.  At first it just looked like a random group of characters made with poor taste.  xD
---
It's stilts right? 
---
best joke EVER
---
I know I’ll probably get downvoted but, is there anyone really still playing GW1?  I have some many great memories playing Fort Aspenwood PVP with the Luxon turtles.  
---
Definitely. It depends on your off hand weapon but could surely could be done. It's one of the reasons why chose to pursuit that spec because I like battle mage classes too.
---
Thank you :)
---
Just recently leveled crafting (weapon and artificer) to 400 on one of my character. I have two questions:
---
1. Can I level more crafting discipline on the same toon or do I need to do it on different toon? 
---
2. Any good guide to make a profit out of crafting? I sunk a big chunk of gold into leveling so I'm now interested in making a return on it.
---
Thanks!
---
"Poorly" was the first thing came to my mind..these days it is true.
---
Anyway, most people like myself used to do it just by memory but i think people do use some addons that mark the spots on their screen too. I honestly dont think one way or the other is better, i prefer memorizing cause it was easy to do for me it is not a lot of spots really.
---
For the add-on....i guess some premade taco markers exist or you could make your own markers for the spots.
---
Relevant.
---
https://imgur.com/a/SWsB9Ly
---
You can use Taco markers to make finding chests a bit easier, but the route is pretty much from memory. Everyone kinda follows the same route for a lap or 2.
---
smh
---
undocumented change. light of deldrimor now lasts until reset in thunderhead peaks.

Either work with your ISP to fix the ping or get a new one. Don't be so disheartened.

---
Hahahahahahaha
---
I understan now thanks! This part was missing from a lot of guides. I thought the first 3 pieces of the armor were just thrown at the player. So if I purchase EOTN and then just keep levelling my GW1 character in the Prophecies campaign and get to Lion's Arch via that questline, I can go to the Hall of Monuments already? I leave the actual EOTN campaign for later?
---
Given that Hearthstone just released an update today as well, that comment really threw me for a loop.
---
Even if I didn't buy EOTN?
---
Yup! Purchase eye of the north, then when yo do the whole LA -&gt; EotN thing and visited the HoM, you can go right back to what you were doing in Prophecies and ignore the expac 'til you're ready! :) 
---
I haven't heard any rumors of a mobile game, but I don't anticipate them abandoning Guild Wars as a product anytime soon. The company is still reporting reasonably high earnings, and I don't see why they would work on a second season of living world in a row just to leave it off there. 
---
Nevertheless, I still hope that update will come soon, even if I have my doubts.
---
I've spent 8k hours playing gw2 and 1.5k on ESO.
---
I ran most vet trials and have 10 chars with flawless conqueror title of all classes back in 2016. I loved ESO gameplay esp. the combat. Abilities are satisfying to use. Cool monsters. Deep lore.
---
One of the **few** things I hate about ESO is that **VET trials are hard to access** in that ESO LFG (if you can call it that even) **sucks, massively**. The only solution to that is finding a guild or friends to run trials with. Joining *a* guild isn't hard but finding the ones that run vet trials during the time you play on your timezone? That's a headache if you're not from NA or EU. LFG similar to gw2 would solve that.  
---
If ESO can improve on that, I can see myself playing both games on a daily basis.
---
That would mean golden zaishen coins are worth a lot more now and it would give incentive to do zaishen dailies.
---
you might disagree but i say there is quite an element of skill involved in executing proper skips with not just stealth but portals, group splits, clever use of waypoints etc.
---
at least it's superior to mindlessly killing everything in your path and it makes me really sad to see people in fractals unaware that blasting smoke fields=stealth
---
there are other things that make dungeons better designed imo: enemies actually deal hefty damage to you and the pressure is in avoiding certain attacks not dancing around aoes/getting hit by "random" stuff(like fractals), checkpoints are slightly more spaced out and less linear which makes dying actually punishing but also the aforementioned splits etc.
---
sure they aren't as flashy because they're outdated and barely touched but i'd much rather do an arah path than deepstone/siren/twilight oasis
---
To think those employees could've stayed home.
---
What does that even mean? What does "play like a spellsword" supposed to tell us? 
---
It's meaning is almost entirely subjective. In some franchise a spellsword is a warrior who augments his fighting capabilities with magic and in others its a mage with a sword. 
---
It can be very different based on your definition. 
---
We cant help unless youre clear about what youre looking for. 
---
I'd say holosmith fits better than sword warrior
---
no shit. lol. and it's just a dungeon name not an xpack.
---
just jokingly taking a shot at a name. Thorns (earth) , Fire, and probably going to be something Water related, i think Jade Sea and going to Cantha but that's just my guess
---

Taken during the HoT CBT2 — May 26, 2015CBT2 — May 26, 2015 after spending like 30 hours grinding for the [Portal To The Heart Of Maguuma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Portal_to_the_Heart_of_Maguuma).
---
Is there a disable lod thing?
---
The Google Glass really ties this entire video together. 
---
besides the merit to surviving via shroud which i personally think it's extremely overrated..it's not that good
---
people really want necro(specifically reaper) to be good at *something* in pve so they pull the self-buff card, pretending soulbeast doesn't exist and other classes can't buff themselves which is untrue..plus open world/story success isn't a metric to consider that much when the requirements to do ok in it are extremely low
---
reaper and soulbeast kinda have the self-buffing built in their meta build but plenty of other builds can swap a trait or utility that gives them more benefits in solo play so imo it's a moot point
---
How do you get so many???
---
says who?
---
I want my elite specs 😥
---
&gt; 10% nostalgia/rose-tinted glasses, and 10% people who can't let go. 
---
Those two are are different?
---
I've heard streamers say this too. Guessing anet said something in an ama or something
---
yeah you earn them, that's how you acquire points. Don't you have to acquire anything before you can hoard it?
---
Plenty of people were running around grabbing up HPs in anticipation of Path of Fire..this isn't any different. 
---
I maxed my necro, unlocked scourge, got more HPs and "hoarded" them / "saved" them for the next xpack so i can immediately unlock the next necro elite.
---
Tu comprendes?
---
But I'm delusional and think it's op!
---
OwO
---
I've been watching all the AMAs like a hawk, i would like to see a source
---
As someone without any ascended armor, I'm just benching my mesmer at this point. I've spent so much crafting exotics that I may as well have made ascended...
---
That's why they should nerf damage across the board for everything and then start buffing slowly.
---
In PUG groups that run 2 healers on boss encounters, you can have one druid and one non-druid healer. More organized runs will usually have one solo druid however. Druid’s main appeal is the 10-man permanent Might it easily provides, as well as unique buffs in the form of spirits and GoE, so until other classes can provide similar benefits, it will probably continue to remain the best choice for a long time.
---
I hope the Wings of Love backpack skin will be free for those of us who own the matching glider.
---
Reason: some time before HoT launched they released the black and white feather wings backpack skins. After HoT launched they released the black and white feather wings gliders to go along with the backpacks. For those of use who already owned the backpacks, we were able to go to Verdant Brink and talk to an NPC to unlock the matching gliders free of charge.
---
It's about time though. I think I bought the Wings of Love glider when it was first released. I among others had wanted a matching backpack skin to go with it.
---
Now.....if they can just make a matching backpack skin to go along with the Phoenix glider, my elemenatalist would be happy. It would go well with her Flamekissed armor. I have the glider, but don't have any backpacks that would look right at the moment.
---
The curse from two years ago, but two days earlier this time... suspicious 
---
Druid could possible be slightly useful in WvW in an extremely niche role if its skills allowed you to target an individual player instead of just “nearby allies”. 
---
Then you could have one Druid per blob who’s sole job is to keep the commander alive. As is, you’re just as likely to end up healing green names instead of the people in your squad. 
---
My preferred classes are Deadeye and Guardian/Dragonhunter. With a fast sickle like the Molten Sickle, I can happily farm winterberries on both without being hit by enemy mobs.
---
Deadeye: Wield Rifle. Take Silent Scope in the Deadeye traitline, this gives you 3 seconds of stealth every time you dodge. Dodge once before each node, each dodge is enough stealth to farm one winterberry node (two if you have a fast sickle) without being detected by enemy mobs. If you get frosted, Rifle 4 is a condi cleanse and can be spammed however much you need. If you want extra safety, you can take all the other thief stealth utilities (particularly Shadow Refuge and the Deadeye elite) as well, or trait for extended stealth with the Shadow Arts traitline.
---
Dragonhunter: If you’re out of combat, you get Aegis re-application from your F3 passive whenever you dismount. Just walk up to node and farms, enemies are pretty slow to notice you and their attack will probably be blocked with the Aegis. Guardian has plenty of condi cleanse utilities as well. Worst case you get caught by a mob, you’re playing DH so you can just burst them down and move on.

When Salt Bae dropped by to season some Choya-ala-crepe from the Amnoon street vendor.

Wow thanks a lot for that project, currently doing world completion on 2 characters and this will be a big help.
---
how to find the best roaming server:
---
1. find which server has the most roamers
---
2. don't be on that server
---
you are making the same mistake that pretty much every roamer makes: attempting to go where other roamers are, so they all end up clumped in the same server.
---
how the hell can you fight other roamers, when all them are stacked on the same server?
---
Because upvoting has literally nothing to do with whether you like the patch? It's not a like button.
---
Kurdicks with their broken life bond monks and suxons with their op turtles
---
&gt; Added hot keys for flagging Heroes 4 through 7 to move to a location.
---
I can't believe they added this into the game after so long.
---
Anyway, welcome improvement for playing solo.
---
That shows you’re downloading at 5MB (megabytes), which is 40Mb (megabits), so you’re not actually downloading that slow. 
---
I did that, but I still get the same error :(
---
There are still plenty of people playing, but the current population definitely is a shadow of its former self.
---
Still, you'll easily find full servers in Kamadan, and if you get into an active alliance, you'll find plenty of people to play with regularly.
---
Meh, holosmith basically uses magical tech, warrior isnt using magical spells and stuff but he certainly fit the oldschool spellsword warriors who wore plates and basically just made themselves stronger with magic instead of using fireballs and stuff. 
---
Sword warrior in itself doesnt really work but with any of the 2 elite spec you can definetly see the warrior isnt just a martial artist, he uses magic too. 
---
Yes, but that doesn't mean ArenaNet didn't blunder.
---
*Clicks expecting people to be making fun of OP for what I think is a typo*
---
Holy shit, actual GW1 patch notes!

[Heavy Dragonscale Headdress](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Dragonscale_Headdress). Like the Raven Helm it cuts off your horns, but I find those two to be the least clippy, neck-showy, or just downright stretched to the point of ugliness.
---
it could even be a boat
---
So, if CS goes on cool down i lose whatever i equipt during that time? 
---
They mentioned LS4 heading to LS5 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-pKVHvfUo

Now if only they'd add jumping that wasn't just an emote, I'd be able to play the game.

Birkie.. you ready to get your mind blown?
---
  1. [Download This](https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher/blob/master/Gw2Launcher/bin64/Release/Gw2Launcher.exe?raw=true)
---
  2. Open it. And then open `%appdata%\GW2 Launchbuddy\Loginfiles` and then open `%appdata%\Gw2Launcher\data` in another folder.
---
  3. Bring up GW2Launcher app and click add New account, Click on "Local.dat", click the `...`and hit "Move From" under use Existing file, and click the `...` under that. Browse to the `%appdata%\GW2 Launchbuddy\Loginfiles` folder (not the window you have up separately in the background).
---
  4. Start from the top with 1.dat and choose that, And click all the "OK" buttons, and make sure you have given it a name in General.
---
  5. After you do this right click on the account in the list and click on Settings.  Under general browse to the gw2.exe game client and select that.  After that go back to the account menu again, right click on the account again.. Go to Selected &gt; Update.  If you have any errors of any sort browse to `%appdata%\Guild Wars 2` and delete the local.dat file in there.  And try the update again.
---
  6. After the update go to the `%appdata%\Gw2Launcher\data` folder you have up in the background.  You'll want to browse in-depth to `%appdata%\Gw2Launcher\data\#\AppData\Roaming\Guild Wars 2` (# being the number it creates).  It will have a Local.dat file in there.  Take and right click on it and copy the file, and go to your other  `%appdata%\GW2 Launchbuddy\Loginfiles` folder you have  up and paste it in there. Rename the file to the .dat file you chose (so in this case 1.dat).  You can use GW2Launcher to find out what account that .dat file belongs to.
---
  7. After that bring up LaunchBuddy and click the account it belongs to, and it should start the game up automatically once again.
---
  8. Right click on the account in the list on GW2Launcher App, and choose the next .dat file from the gw2 launchbuddy loginfiles folder like before and do the next one.  Repeat until all have been updated.
---
once you have a rough sense for the chests locations, it becomes pretty easy to spot the mounds. best overlays like taco can do is mark all possible spawn locations, but since there will never be a case in which all of those are populated, and actual route that follows all of them would be quite inefficient.
---
Range and real melee abilities? What else? The warrior does uses skills, the elementalist casts spells duh.
---
Interesting.
---
Expect more patch tomorrow, the devs said.
---
Didn't notice this being mentioned, but the original plan for the Living World releases were open world events that changed the world little by little (or in some instances drastically in certain areas) and thus was more of a limited time release. That being said, we currently are on Season 4 of the Living World and only the first season was limited time. The rest can be purchased to play still. There is a recap of the first season in game, but it definitely isn't the same as playing through it, you might be able to find someone who uploaded videos to YouTube, which would be a little bit closer getting up to date. But seeing as this is in between the Core game story and the second season story, you don't really have to worry about catching up until you have reached level 80 and completed the storyline for the base game.  
---
TLDR; So while you can play most of the content that has been released for the game, there is an amount of it that isn't playable, and a little bit more that is seasonal only.
---
there's no hope, we'll all die someday
---
Some of the things I like about ESO over GW2;
---
* Add-ons are Awesome - Like there is so many to choose from and there programs and interfaces that are a godsend in terms of maintaining them. It feels so good to have that much freedom with setting stuff up and tailoring the qol features you want. Plus in the case of guild traders default ui, it's almost necessary to have an add-on fo it, cause I'd rather pull my nails out with pliers than try and navigate that mess (though to be fair, they're thankfully coming out with a new qol update here like next month I think that they've overhauled the whole guild trader ui).
---
* Wayshrines - I like the fact that I can go up to a Wayshrine and port anywhere I've been for free and only have to pay if I port while not at a Wayshrine. Not that it's a lot of money to port in GW2, but it would be nice if I could just run up to a WP to port and save a little silver like in ESO.
---
* Player Housing and Decorations - It's awesome, I absolutely love it. There's so many kinds of decorations to go for and houses to choose. It's similar in ways to GW2's Guild Halls but more accessible in ways (especially with the aforementioned add-ons), has more variety in ones to go for, and you can show them off to guildies (which is in part because there is no actual proper guild hall system, so people will designate a specific player's house an unofficial guild hall in like their guild message). Also it's really neat that when you finish a dungeon for the first time in ESO, you unlock a [mounted head of one of the bosses](https://eso.mmo-fashion.com/furnishings-undaunted-trophies/) in that dungeon as a decoration to hang in your house.
---
* Dyeable Weapons - Speaks for itself (though the variety in the dye system in ESO is nowhere near as good as GW2, not to mention it costs gold to dye you stuff and you have to go to an outfit station to do it).
---
* Lore Books/Notes - Really cool reading all the [deep thought provoking book](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Lusty_Argonian_Maid) and stuff to find. Really helps with world building and just shake things up in terms of content type.
---
* Random Daily Rewards Scheduled Each Month - While the chest of loyalty is neat in GW2, the dailies are kinda boring. ESO changes up the dailies each month and offers up some really interesting stuff. Some months you can get nice amounts of gold, crown crates, exclusive pets/mounts, or cool outfits. It's fun seeing what a new month brings from this kind of daily structure (unless you get a month like this month where the only thing interesting is a bland dress outfit that doesn't help you and roster of all male characters that wouldn't look too good in it -.-).
---
* Challenging People to Duels - Speaks for itself.
---
* Special Events and Giveaways - ESO does a lot of these special events where you can get prizes. When I started playing ESO, they were in the middle of an event called [Summerfall](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/summerfall) where just by logging in and doing this one easy map exploration achievement (which you only needed to login to get credit for it, doing the achievement is for the sake of a participation meter that kept track of how many people completed it and unlocked different rewards for how many did it by the end of the event) to earn various prizes. Things like a non-combat pet (basically ESO's version of a minipet, though they are mostly all normal pet sized), a mount, and a manor. Along with that you have things like Twitch drops for watching ESO streams, which they'll send you [Ouroboros Crates](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Ouroboros_Crate) (basically one of the games various kinds of lootboxes, but it's specific to like community events and Twitch drops). It's felt like a decent reward, massively helped build and expand the game's content creators (like I'm not a person who watches Twitch streams very often, especially ones on MMO's, but the drops have actually helped me find content creators that I actually enjoy and will occasionally watch outside of the drop schedules), and helped to advertise it's game. 
---
Now as for the ESO Cyrodill vs WvW stuff, as a WvWer, I'm not a big fan of Cyrodill. Like the map feels too spread out, siege hits like a truck, there's no real commander tag system in ESO, the keeps are all pretty much just copy pasted replicas of one another, the towers in camps are just noob bait for enemies with trolly builds to lure people in to farm, it's a pain sometimes trying to leave back to the normal PvE zones, and it personally doesn't feel as reward as WvW (not to say there isn't some nice rewards, just that they don't feel as good and as lucrative as WvW). I do like the concept of the Emperor (and the exclusive rewards it unlocks if you are/were one) as well as the scrolls mechanic (I miss the concept of the orbs in wvw), but everything else was kinda meh or irritating in comparison.
---
All of that said, both are awesome games. GW2 is my favorite between the two, but they are both fun to bounce back and fourth between when I'm feeling a little bored with one or the other.
---
If I can think of more I'll edit them in later.
---
Oh God... didn't meant that .\_.
---
The only skills that are locked are elite skills, every other skill you can get by either buying them or questing. I started a fresh run where we try to do a GWAMM without using the xunlai chest or heroes until we reach nightfall and its pretty easy, you get your first max armor in droknars i only used the mats/money i got in Proph and got my full max armor set with full runes (only a +41 hp tho) and insignias as soon as we reached droknars forge.   
---
the problem is thats people are just blindly storming into mobs without trying to figure out groups first, flag henchies/heroes and pull favorable matchups. thats how you get killed. and that has nothing to do with 19/20's gameplay but that people are just spoiled to oblivion to press 1 and kill everything in sight.   
---
you get all heroes you need by just playing nightfall and eotn, if you have problems clearing those content try to find people or read a guid about proper teambuilding.  
---
you can accuse gw1 about other things like the weird rubber banding, enemy ai running weird paths, or that the monk henchmen just dont want to let go of healing breeze but gameplaywise gw1 is still unique and one of the best teambuilding games out there
---
some animations lack terrain adjustment variables. as a result the feet are level with each other, and the game still visually attempts to keep both on the ground. try it with a quaggan tonic.
---
Yeah we opened a ticket shortly after it happened
---
It's still going on and all the NPCs are still hyper aggressive 
---
Isn't this guild wars TWO reddit, not 1
---
Im literally in shock lol how did I not know this??
---
It actually is
---
He needs to be blacklisted.
---
The only heroes locked behind a paywalls are mercenaries, which are your own characters in hero AI. GW provides 3 heroes of each class, except Mesmer and Ritualist where only 2 are available. Razah is flexible in his class so he can be whatever you need him to be.
---
you can purchase additional crafting profession upgrades from the gem store for 800 gems
---
This is the reward for tournament winning team indeed
---
Seems rather unfair to all the casuals who suck but support the game more than pvpers do and get nothing in return lol
---
My experience in PvE has been "Alright time to close this gap with fire and fuck this shi... ouch ouch ouch ouch... I need my barrier... ouch ouch... oh shit I'm in the wrong element set.. run run run..."
---
At least it was in the beginning. It's a fun spec. Completely changes what elementalist was, and I have a hard time believing the next spec will be groundbreaking since the first two were.
---
In WvW. I have thousands too, along with a couple thousand chests from which you could get 6 proofs each I think.
---
Most pvp is played with a small niche of "use this or youll lose"
---
The only skill is timing. As I'm sure you know, the majority of builds don't work in pvp, just like raids. 
---
sounds simple, you should sign up for the tournament
---
&gt; It always starts near the port from the previous lower level zone in the same region, like Kessex starts where you enter from Queensdale swamp, Metrica in the entrance from Rata Sum and so on:-) Only Gendarran and Bloodtide Coast starts at LA entrances
---
This is true beauty.
---
Lmao
---
It’s TOL not the ladder rewards 
---
I am not sure if trolling or not.  
---
I assume you are. If not: if you play since launch, how on earth dont you have enough money to buy it?!
---
I really wish the next expansion was coming this year but sadly we'll have to wait until after Living Season 5 :(
---
consider my second point, and suddenly it isn't quite as pointless.
---
the change from proofs to testimonies was about as consequential as anet's storage experiment with congealed putrescence. considering that it doesn't make too much sense to needlessly have a nother dead currency in the wallet.
---
we had boon overload, frailty and outflanked, as soon as an add spawned and attacked your full buffed back u were  done :D
---
Interstellar*
---
Wait shit wrong Matt.
---
Because 1. People have lives that need taken care of first
---
2. They keep changing the game so either spend that gold so you can do enough damage to get good loot, or pray you did that with outdated content
---
3. Legendaries take an extremely large amount of time and effort to make without external help. See point 1
---
no pay to win, the cash shop is almost entirely cosmetic and QoL focused, and allows for purchases through in game currencies.
---
raid members are like, dont stand in the red rings or you will be teleported, what red rings, there is too much visual diarrhoea! well listen to them, but there's too much aural diarrhoea!
---
Two updates yesterday. This one is definitly the best. *-*
---
The last episode just came out a few weeks ago
---
&gt;  but gameplaywise gw1 is still unique and one of the best teambuilding games out there
---
I'm not discrediting the uniqueness of GW1 or its potential, but it has lots of drawbacks from modern eyes. 
---
There are tons of snowball effects implied. Last time I tried seriously, I asked some advices on GW1's subreddit. I was given a few great builds that would basically allow me to breeze through most content without too many headache. 
---
But just getting the requirements for the build was a challenge itself, and the objective was to even play the game lol. I had to get certain heroes, but then it would have required me to go through various quest chains across multiple campaigns to get them, or very specific requirements (The Norn Fighting Tournament for Xandra). Some of these quests (or even reaching them) was incredibly tedious and long by time.
---
Then their build. Certain elite skills are locked behind specific bosses on specific maps, and I cannot task a hero to capture its own skill (afaik), I have to do it myself. Which means either having an alt like I said, or changing my second profession.
---
Everything was gated behind multiple gates and at this point I asked myself what I was gaining out of that. While I will probably forever desire multiple HoM rewards, I'm already drowning with armor and weapon skins.
---
you've been a warrior since level 1, you defeated all pve bosses by punching them in the face, war is what you do, battlefield is your home, how else would you heal your allies: yell at them to get well.
---
Thanks for watching!
---
It is indeed through Yolomouse, i'm 99% sure i used the cursor pack from https://github.com/Archomeda/gw2-yolomouse-cursors. I think WoodenPotatoes has a video guide for it as well.
---
good god, what assclown put a portal under you during combat?
---
Funny enough another topic JUST mentioned how the top players say get good and they're wrong to do so because not everyone can waste their life on hundreds of hours of a game to learn every aspect about it in order to be good.
---
So, nou
---
&gt; Veteran player returning? [Question]
---
[Yea](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/an3u98/is_gw2_still_worth_playing_in_feb_4th_2019_at/)
---
I may be wrong but I think the only way to get it is from being the top ranked played in pvp.
---
And then we need to do heart so that we can summon Captain Planet.
---
Still slow as shit for me
---
Ok, mr. “only skill is timing,” I’ll 1v1 you for a 5k stake, and you can even bring a metronome
---
Chests are buried everywhere and in most cases there's one just a few notches away after using radar. It's really not that hard to find them, though I guess experience might help find the best spots quicker.
---
Go back to RP‘ing in DR and stop being mad about the little stuff pvp gets
---
Any source about the expansion? I highly doubt it season 5 will be over early next year and we don't even know if we are getting an expansion or another season after.
---
Every prior TOL has awarded legendaries. Why are you acting like this is a new thing with sudden nefarious consequences?
---
Skipping the crafting of brand new legendaries is not little
---
I don't pvp nor do I much time. I'm not complaining, maybe you should go back to your mum and cry because the world is "oh so unfair for lill boy's like you :("
---
I mean..only 5 people will get this chest 
---
 as somebody with a weak PC and horrible aussie internet I always play on low settings, so I can honestly say, this has never been an issue for me.
---
Are you one of those toxic casuals I've heard so much about?
---
Try out an different game mode if u returning, from all the gear u have I’m guessing u did mostly pve, maybe try out wvw or pvp and get good at that. Otherwise I don’t really know why u want to return. 
---
the thing is you kind of need EotN to get to the Hall of Monuments which is part of linking it to gw2 so step three is gonna be: buy EotN.
---
I think only nintendo is that backwards today with splatoon 2 data being saved on the console without cloud saves.
---
I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite expansion in Guild Wars 2.
---
When I was doing it about a month ago it was still barely enough time to get through and took me a couple of tries
---
LOL!! I thought I was the only one to be honest! The one that always gets me is when the old rata sum music plays literally anywhere besides rata sum.
---
Hah yeah. When I was waiting for GW2 to come out I really wanted to play a norn solely because u enjoyed their lore in the first game so much. I mean you’re telling me one of them is basically an army of people? Sign me up. And I REALLY wanted to use their bear form. Fast forward to today and norn never transform, they basically are the same as humans....just larger, annddd they talk about wanting to make their legend but like I don’t get the same feeling from them as I did in the previous game.
---
But first we summon the avatar.
---
10. EU + NA
---
I hoped so but the price hasn't started to budget yet.
---
My thoughts about it. I think we'll start to see even more ToLs coming up soon enough, as this one is now based on Automated Tournament system, hence there will be less downtime between matches this Saturday and there are less additional rewards (Besides main ones: legendary materials, precursors and legendaries themselves).
---
Sure, but what does *that* have to do with whether or not testimonies of heroics could be used for expac3 elite specs?
---
i got the game shortly after release. pretty much until HoT pre orders came around i didn't invest any cash into it. at that point i already had  a good amount of character slots, bag slots across all classes, bank tabs, storage expansions, copper fed, several infinite gathering tools, deluxe upgrade, and multiple armor purchases pre-wardrobe.
---
that was on a ~95% wvw diet that only changed when SW came around to around 70%.
---
does that qualify for your original question?
---
So much this. I haven't seen so bright effects (actually I see almost none) while using best performance settings. I also do it during raids to see mechanics better. Only thing I switch is sampling, back to super, or native if I have fps problems during really big fights.
---
You do not have to grind really, to get most of stuff you might need from gs over time (get gems when cheap, spend when sales also helps).
---
You are complaining about a 14 year old game not meeting modern standards.
---
And being sad you can't just get everything at once without doing quests etc to get it.
---
 GW2 makes you unlock things before you can have optimal builds ,gear etc.
---
Masteries ,hero points grinding for mats / gold for equipment.
---
Try making a free account on GW2 and having to unlock everything again from scratch,it will be similar except you can jump and it's open world.
---
I haven't done my dailies yet, but yesterday there was slippery slope in the Chaos fractal and it was not present at the JP parts of the fractal (as stated in some patch notes a while back). So I assume for the maze it will be turned off as well.
---
[In case you missed top gilded best of the best q&amp;a](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/an3u98/is_gw2_still_worth_playing_in_feb_4th_2019_at/)
---
And the gold/time ratio is much better
---
There's so much set up to get that though and a sacrificial golem every time.
---
Not sure if troll or .... nah, definitely troll.
---
none, i heard rumors there wont be any (at all). 
---
Go ahead and level up a character to level 20 or so to get back into the grove. If you have one of your characters that hasn't done the initial personal story yet, do that instead. You could even just do some casual dungeons, world bosses, or tier 1 fractals to warm up.
---
Open your achievement panel and look for exploration achievements, if you try them without guides they can be quite tricky, it's a bunch of hideouts, jumping puzzles and riddles, many of those are places in low level zones (Caledon 4xjp, 2x hideout for example)
---
General tip for leveling: get as many PvE dailys done as possible, they'll bring you around the maps (e.g. events, vistas or farming in dedicated zones/maps) and will reward you with 1 writ of experience each, which is basically extra XP ;)
---
If you are up for a challenge, just team your friends up and try how far above your actual level you are capable to sustain. Even if you got f2p accs you are only bound to stay in the starting areas till level 10 iirc, so now you are good to go on every map you like
---
Visual clutter and getting overwhelmed by telegraphs/animations are two very distinct things.
---
Visual clutter : *I can't see shit, no matter how familiar I am with the fight.*
---
Overwhelmed : *With experience, I can handle all the tells at once.*
---
I remember being completely overwhelmed by Gorseval or Matthias when I first fought them. Too many things to take care of, to look at. But now, it's fairly clear.
---
&gt; This is with postprocessing on LOW.
---
Try None?
---
&gt; You are complaining 
---
No I'm expressing myself...
---
&gt; about a 14 year old game not meeting modern standards.
---
Various game designs can survive the passage of time. I just took an opportunity to express how hard it was for me to dive into the game now, even in spite of very interesting updates like this one.
---
&gt; And being sad you can't just get everything at once without doing quests etc to get it.
---
No, not at all. It's not about getting "everything at once". It's just that *the content I'm interested in* is locked behind various other layers of requirements combined with a very slow, clunky and old gameplay. 
---
That's fine if you still enjoy it, but to me it's just not a good time investment and I expressed it. That's what forums/discussions are for.
---
&gt; Try making a free account on GW2 and having to unlock everything again from scratch,it will be similar except you can jump and it's open world.
---
I would probably have a better time given the fact that there are many players and activities, something the instanced nature of GW1 prevents.
---
I don't think you can really compare both products. GW2 is more accessible by nature, that was its intention. GW1 come from an era where it was a norm to offer a more complex game design.
---
no, no idea what spellsword is as a standard. yes - entering pvp area will give you access to everything you need to determine if ele will work for you.
---
Haha yeah some of those older trails, the visibility on those are so short, they can't even keep up with raptor canyon jump :P
---
I'm not sure why I'm bothering to reply to you but my reasons are my reasons, I don't care if you think they're stupid or not.
---
I've watched countless videos about raid encounters and a good handful of them are hard for me to read THERE. I can't imagine trying to do it during the fight.
---
At least the legendary should be ABed, so no reselling for profit.
---
yes and no
---
yes - I have a LOT gemstore items which were 90% bougth by gold to gems
---
and no - I really never hardcore gold grind, just doing daily, pvp seasons, fractals and little raids ..gold come much faster nowdays then 6 years ago. 
---
Everywhere but a place that is an overlay, I wasnt going to trust a site that was an overlay. Until I saw or hear first hand proof
---
they are not, you can be melee and ranged with anything in gw2 and most of the time both withing same build. channeled skills/casts can be both melee and raged as well. 
---
Well that is first hand proof lol
---
Nah, clearly, if you RP in some village 30 minutes a day and can't get even one legendary since launch, you support the game much more and you should be handed a legendary as a gift for your amazing loyalty.
---
now imagine:
---
you go into PvP, having slain 2 elder dragons etc., and another player defeats you. doesnt he deserve the legendary even more than you do? :P
---
A biased one
---
I've got multiple Legendaries by playing PvE. You must do something wrong.
---
i play since launch and never bought any gems with cash, only with gold and I propably bought well over 100k gems until now.
---
70k gems for account upgrades/unlocks which can be tracked with gw2efficiency and then some more for stuff you cant track, like server transfers, BL keys or other consumables.
---
How so, I said one sentence after your instant mad kid response “fuck off”. Please just quit answering, not interested in a dumbass who cant be told anything just cause its your “opinion”
---
How so?  It has a dev on it basically saying it's well within the rules to use it.
---
I think that guide might be outdated. It's recommending the "increased incoming healing" trait, instead of the "increased damage when entering or exiting shroud" trait. These two traits just changed a few patches ago, so it appears that Discretize hasn't updated their Reaper guide since then.
---
GW1 : my first MMO and I love(d) it so much.
---
You press shit f5? its from 20 days ago
---
This is ridiculous..... I want it !
---
ty for giving me ideas.
---
If you're not multiclassing and what you were playing got shafted then what can you do? Can't just transfer your skill from X spec to Y. You'll almost certainly start falling in rank.
---
I'm not talking about gold and silver elohell ratings but higher tiers.
---
&gt; Map completion is about exploration and enjoying the journey [...] Now with this addon, it's even a bigger joke.
---
Well new players that want to experience that still can.  They aren't forced to use this if they don't want to.  This tool is 95% for veteran players that don't give 2 fucks about the "journey" and have spent too many hours already doing the same old shit.
---
Yeah but the build is wrong. This is a build from before December 11th, regardless of what the page says. Look at the second trait in the Soul Reaping line.
---
From the December 11th patch:
---
&gt; Vital Persistence: This trait no longer reduces the recharge time of shroud skills. Instead, it increases all incoming healing by 20% in PvE and by 10% in PvP and WvW. Its vitality bonus is unchanged.
---
and
---
&gt; Soul Barbs: This trait has replaced Spectral Mastery in the Master tier. It grants a 10% damage increase to all attacks for 10 seconds whenever necromancers enter or exit a shroud.
---
Maybe I'm missing something and for some reason they really want improved incoming healing and a little vitality, but I doubt it. I think the build was just never actually updated.
---
So how does a standard spellsword play? All of the classes have some level of magic and can be considered "spellswords". 
---
Try doing it on a tier 8 server that never played and you were stuck not getting that Vista inside a tower for months :(
---
You have Shadow Flare and Dagger Storm for AoE as well as traits that reduce the cooldown on them in addition to a trait that causes marked target death to deal AoE damage. 
---
D'awww, I just got used to it.
---
Scourge nerfs confirmed?
---
[nah, gw1 is essentially immortal](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-16-arenanet-guild-wars-1-could-last-forever).
---
&gt;suck the life out of you
---
&gt;NSFW
---
yes pls
---
So is every single class, there is no difference in how they work so your definitions are completely arbitrary. 
---
Artwork curtessy /u/Arcanaxis
---
Naturally.
---
It's not a free legendary, you have to win the tournament. For a pvp player winning games is their main "job" so it's a well deserved reward. (And i'm not going to enter into the issues that plague pvp like people selling wins).
---
And that’s fair. Everything I’ve said was about my own personal perspective.
---
GW1 is very unique and would have won in the long term to be a bit more accessible. As it is, I just think it’s hard for new players to try the game and for me to dive back. But it could have been different.
---
And try to dodge VGs blue circles, when u have Guardian with you....impossible :D 
---
The game director, but what does he know.
---
Sad but what you said is mostly true. Although it is also understandable from their part, I mean if you are playing silver or gold, maybe even plat T1 (EU) and there are countless mirages as they say, it can be annoying. But you can't balance a game based on that.
---
The downvotes and no counter arguments, well, it is regular here sadly. 
---
My final months of playing the game was only alliance battles and fort aspenwood. I played both sides. On Luxon side I loved playing healing rit because the spirits affected the turtle and the warriors. On Kurzick side it was hilarious to bond the gatekeepers and if the enemy didn't bring enchant removal they couldn't break that gate the whole game. Later the devs added enchant removal to the turtle attacks. However, the funniest moments were when an EoE ranger was present on one side or the other. A single kill triggered such a chain reaction that it could clean up the entire map.
---
wrong, gotta get this free key !
---
You know, you *do* have a point...
---
Yes, voice actors have more than one role.
---
You should upvote incase people read and notice there's literally nothing in this patch other than minor bugfixes and making achievements LS easier to obtain. 
---
Oh and fluff in the gemstore ofcourse. 
---
Stop hoping, realise this game is on a steady decline which anet is content with, while milking it for money. 
---
Just stop hoping. Whatever you wish for, unless it's minimal updates other than LS every 3 months (which will also get slower), it's probably not going to happen.
---
Hehe, thanks a lot &lt;3
---
Preaching to the choir here; I totally agree with you. It's just that OP is all "I don't want to buy the game until I know I'll have fun at Lv80, which I'm not right now."
---
tbh I have no idea how we're supposed to convince OP of something that's totally subjective and needs to be experienced before a judgement can be made. The full game with expansions is so much more than what Core brings to the table.
---
Alright i will look for another guild. The only thing i'm missing is ascended backpack and secondary weapon. But the back is expensive as hell ... I need 250 vials of powerful blood and i only have about 50 :D
---
Tempest + Jackal. Jackal for the barrier, tempest for Condi cleanse. Just the aura is usually enough.
---
Mirage, the cloak doesn't interrupt gathering IIRC.
---
Necro, let the minions deal with the mobs instead.
---
Tbh, all classes have some tricks to make the gathering simple. I usually gather with all my chars, and except the ones that I don't play often, I can clear the route pretty quickly.
---
I would say it is fine. For most classes. Especially those power dps ones, which are better suited for training raids.
---
How is this disrespectful though? The post is objectively a much better fit for the gw1 sub than the GW2 sub.
---
Try Post-processing on off. It's like night and day in PoF zones.
---
It would make sense for them to get the skin (or have their own distinct pvp rewards). But a full legendary weapon only makes sense in PvE. It's not just a trophy (as just the skin unlock could be), it's a tool with practical PvE purposes.
---
It would be like PvE players getting PvP tokens or titles when farming events or doing raids.
---
im still hoping for a setting to scale down the particle effects so i can actually see wtf is going on without having to set everything to low graphics
---
The timer on this was increased years ago :)
---
You still need to hurry up a bit, but you can make it. This said, if you don't get rubber-banded on that tree on your way down... For real, that tree is the actual boss of Pre-Searing Ascalon.
---
after soo many years... it's still rocking
---
* Under water content so bad even sharks moved
---
* Dozens of beached sharks found in Frostgorge Sound, content drought to blame
---
* Ba Dum Tss!
---
In terms of berserker gear being too expensive, I'll let you in on a little secret. There are [named armor sets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) for some of the base game stats, including berserker, that sell for much less than their crafted counterparts on the trading post, but are identical in every way but name, look, and cost. There's a different name prefix for each armor weight and stat set, the light armor zerker set is Zhed's. Alternatively, you could use the button next to the search box to refine your search to include only items with whatever three stats at whatever level and rarity (might be a good idea for grabbing weapons for cheap).
---
If berserker ends up being too squishy or difficult, you could substitute a few marauder (recommended, but might be harder to find), soldier's, or valkyrie's armor pieces or trinkets. Really any set with power and vitality (which also will increase your max life force) will do. You shouldn't have too much trouble staying alive as a minion necro, just be aware of your positioning, step away from or dodge big attacks, and don't forget you can always use your shroud as a panic button.
---
astral/stellar and carnival weapons should have one whole achievement point, too.  it's only fair, after all
---
&gt; someone who motivated you to become better
---
Is this about that "git gud" post?
---
Is thst the one where you get winter berries?
---
...are we just pretending that half of the items in that chest are not buyable from the TP? Or that crafting legendaries requires PvP and WvW?
---
Haha thanks! I had to actually look up who that is, and I do indeed kind of look like him ;P Dang you Anet for kind of stealing my style hehe ;D
---
RIBA? 
---
Forgive me, I'm still new to the terms of this game.
---
(I only found out what zerk meant a week ago after playing for under a month \^\^; )
---
then dont play...
---
yea, back is cheap/ez to get there
---
12-20e each. 5e last week.
---
Sell now and buy them back for less when the demand drops I guess.
---
Alright, thanks man!
---
Hehehe, more than half a year.
---
Basically type that in lfg under Tyria Squads and join them. It involves running a certain path, and tagging everything that you see. Good way to do most things SW related in the process.
---
You are just totaly awesome. I have never felt so bad for playing on EU like now when i cant learn from ya :D 
---
Do it for the sake of poor EU players who cant reach you IG :(
---
I think he means he has them unlocked but still has excess hero points ready to unlock one and a half specialistions.
---
nobody plays for fun. if you wanna have fun start having rl
---
Except in some cases you are cutting your self by doing so. At least in situations were there are not that many sold and cutting 50 gold under will get others to cut under your 50 gold and now you are at the same position as the rest of us because they did that before yours got sold. And now you either have to wait for months until it goes back up again or re-list it and pay another fee risking for it to get stuck again.
---
just because he cleared all the Achievements of living world in the first month it was out it doesn't mean there is a content drought
---
and it's not like there will be no further content in 2-3 Months
---
No, the 30% x 5 works like this: you have a permanent MF buff and you get double that for 1s after opening a chest. So +150% always and +150% extra for 1s after opening.
---
My team and I will win easily this tournament.
---
Gold players btw haHAA
---
different gamemode.
---
WvW in that case (Nevermind Mirages being annoying there, too) and it only works with sacrificing a golem and against individual (and gullible) enemies.
---
Again, I said that they could unlock the skin. Not the weapon itself that has completely no use in PvP beyond the skin.
---
I met my wife online but not in Guild Wars 2. We've been together since before Guild Wars 1 came out.
---
Disgusting. I see those people like a fucking Gollum treasuring this sub as it was their property. Eat shit reporters.
---
Little side note: official store Euro prices have been heavily increased, up to 33% for EotN. I guess ANet wants to give those devs some money for their effort, after all. Right?
---
I've only recently opened up the Silverwastes myself recently so glad to see I'm not the only one that got a wee bit confused by this :)
---
From what I can tell, to retrieve the body pieces you need to have a status effect on you from one of the consumables you can buy from the bandit crest trader (you might be able to get it from others, but that's where I've noticed them). I think I got an initial 3hr consumable through the intro stuff to the map which gives you a random body part when you kill one of the bosses during the events, but you can buy 1hr consumables which target a particular body part.
---
If in doubt check the GW2 wiki - I would be lost without it for some of the nunances surrounding the various collections and obscure items you pick up along the way.
---
Dota is leaking
---
Well that is how WvW works overall isn't it? We have bandwagon servers for zergs as well who are beating every server and moan about no competition and no comanders who can fight them. 
---
No trouble finding Me/Mo.
---
Well they're your reasons and that is fine, but it's also fine to say your reasons are stupid since there is obviously not that much clutter that you can't see a thing so it just comes out as an excuse but sure keep telling yourself it's the clutter.
---
Didn't read, lol.
---
Reading is hard, I get it.
---
When i heard about the slippery slope bug when it came out i thought meh i wait until bugs are ironed out before i go back to fractals. Then for every post i read about the new instabilities i seem to not manage to tell my self to make them again. 
---
Seriously, what exactly are people expecting to accomplish by coming to one forum solely to bitch about another forum?
---
Justice? 
---
Your post was removed within 15 minutes.. lmao, kinda hard to read what isn’t there 
---
if you want content drougth then go back to pre release HoT or release HoT (after most rushed through most of the content, before they managed to pull a living world out of their arses and then had enormous delays inbetween releases) this seaseon all releases had pretty much a cylcle of 3-4ish months inbetween releases since "A Bug in the System", so no there is no real actual Content Drought
---
Really shows that aNet is really proud of Mesmers and it's their "Golden child". Mesmers are just immensely all-a-round good class and they put lot of effort in with clones and phantasms and what-nots. And in lore, they are even better (Jennah shielding whole DR? Nice)
---
For wow that class was shamans and warriors. Mostly warriors. They just looove that barbaric theme of pure strength and fantasy-war.

The rarely seen Ice Skate Shark.

I think you should Play as a necro for a while so you actually learn how to Play without all those crutches.

Oh, okay. I'll let the FBI know.

The reason why you got an upvote. Can't stop laughing. XD

I undercut much (like from 22g to 20g while instant sell is 15g) - that way I can sell item "fast like instant sell" without selling for much lower instant sell price.
---
Sirens landing (S3E6) also has backpacks for cheap. Bitterfrost is a lot more profitable overall though.
---
It's allowed to use:-)
---
easy way for anet to incentivize revisiting old content: add achievements for all the events in the core tyria maps, similar to how VB has achievements related to seeing an outpost all the way through completion.  old maps won't be so barren, new players can meet/interact with veterans more often, and people will actually care to participate in events which were touted to be one of the unique features of GW2
---
i got 2/9 but not gonna pay $47 for more content 
---
That feeling when you see them adding quality of life changes you would have enjoyed 10 years ago.
---
i long gave up on GW2 ever lasting longer then the first time playing the new releases for only the story i am not even motivated to go for the achievements
---
tho i think it's more of an issue with myself then with the game, especially since all the ppl i used to play together and doing other stuff like dungeons or fractals stopped or cut contact
---
i restarted playing, for about a year or so, GW1 to finally get everything finished i never did as a stupid teenager in that game xD
---
that's what i do in-between waiting for LW releases
---
&gt; But a full legendary weapon only makes sense in ~~PvE~~.
---
WvW
---
Why is there an issue in giving the tournament winners, who very well might not be playing PvP only, a legendary weapon?  Especially *if* it's not accountbound, meaning they can sell it and get other stuff they prefer.
---
We might be getting elite specs with the next season though.
---
It's a noob trap. New players shouldn't buy it because they *need* to level their characters properly to learn how the game works, veteran players shouldn't buy it because they know levelling to 80 is mostly trivial. The target audience is people in between who are impatient and want to level a new character without actually playing the game.
---
Apparently there are some indexing bugs what you could fix:-)
---
havent payed a cent on the game for the last 3.5 to 4 years and I buy gemstore stuff every month.
---
Considering that people are doing doa faster nowadays than back then shows that even without that exploit people can have fun and grind times :)
---
some of those questions lump way too much stuff for a yes/no, like:
---
&gt; Have you continued to play a game even though you were aware of negative consequences, such as not getting enough sleep, being late to school/work, spending too much money, having arguments with others, or neglecting important duties?
---
pretty sure everyone's stayed up late at some point to play games, but answering Yes makes it seem like you do the other stuff that's significantly worse than losing a couple hours of sleep.  
---
i give this quiz a 1/9
---
I agree there should an achievement for getting all the ascended skins.
---
Same for stellar weapon set.
---
that's not the definition of hoarding lol. hoarding loterally just means stocking up or saving.
---
i could technically spend my point and unlock scourge on my human necro reaper, but i already have another scourge toon...so i CAN spend it on something else but i dont wanna
---
Last ToL (2016) had 41 Teams on EU. Lets see how it goes..
---
To top it off, on my group our chrono got a bug related to Slippery Slope where he would slide non-stop to the side of the room, as if it was tilted somehow, he had to leave the instance to fix it...

Wouldn't even be the worst thing change potentially. Will dumb the game down but with the current powercreeped levels of boon and condition application I'm not convinced the game won't be more enjoyable with this change, even if hilariously unbalanced. 
---
This place is like the opposite of /r/totalwar, where people BEG for bug fix patches. We just got our FIRST patch that doesn't have any content and only bug fixes and some people say it's the best update they've ever done for Total War Warhammer lol. 
---
CA usually only tie bug fixes to content updates, and that sucks because even if they fix a bug, a new one is introduced by the new content and then there's months of waiting time until it's fixed.
---
Are you against what I said? Do you just want to add more? You post is all over the place and I don't understand what you tried to say besides thr fact that you're making some arguments which may or may not be relevant to my post or yours. 
---
Let me restate, tournaments for Pvp are more difficult than ANYTHING in PvE. Whatever you posted doesn't disprove my statement.
---
I've been playing the new map pretty much every day for about 2 hours, I don't see your point. Obviously if you don't like the rewards you won't play it. How much time do you spend in WoW leveling zones mate? I don't see any difference in content there.
---
Who said the person winning cant be playing since launch either? Also, there is no level of casually playing since launch that would not have resulted in enough materials to at least craft a precursor or enough gold to straight up buy the legendary weapon. Even playing 2 hours on max level already gives you about 2% of a precursor in materials if you are actually doing anything.
---
They didn't have log-in rewards at launch.
---
Agreed. Give the PvP guys some cookies already.
---
Aww I miss doing this to the champ risen shark in Orr 
---
Outfits are not armor. I see what you're saying, since this is a post about skins. But calling an outfit "armor" is incorrect.
---
Fort and the Luxon eauivalent got me into pvp with my ritualist. Ah, the memories...
---
Normal meaning what it was before the update, where there was no hitching, obviously.
---
Because most of the time the story is pretty bland/generic. And I don't think there is such a thing as an mmo without a story.
---
I wnat to hear the whole story lol
---
It's almost guaranteed to NOT bring new specs. This is anet we're talking about. They take 4 months to do a map + 2 hours of content. You think they are gonna bring any new specs? Don't count on it.
---
Consider this: Would we know about Path of Fire without the leaks? No, it would be revealed at the end of S03E06. What if this time they learned from their mistakes and actually did not fuck up and leak anything? That way we get an announcement in two months from now and an expansion 5 months from now.
---
I don't what else to say. I had issues like the everyone else, but not anymore.
---
Also, **relevant username**. 
---
If farming, just best performance cuz u know not lagging &gt; pretty face
---
It grab 4 for the first time on rich node and 3 on second time, could it be bug?
---
The free bank space is nice, every character had turned into a packmule (Add wardrobe please).  
---
I never really did Zaishen missions much, so the 10 Golden Zaishen cost per rune is a bit much for me.
---
Doubtful... remember that without leaks, we wouldn't know about Path of Fire until S03E06 in the very last cutscene. What if this time they didn't fuck up and contained all the possible leaks so that the reveal in the next episode is an actual reveal? That would put the release date of Expansion 3 in Fall 2019 (HoT Fall 2015, PoF Fall 2017, X3 Fall 2019) Makes perfect sense to me if I'm being honest
---
Join a RIBA map and tag all events.
---
Ideally you want to do this on characters that did not explore the map so you can map complete as well, taking advantage of the down times, to get additional crests.
---
consider this: season 4 is confirmed to directly transition into season 5
---
No... stocking up means stocking up and hoarding means hoarding. Hoarding is collecting items without the intent of using them, or outright without any reason.
---
If they were to introduce a new reward, people would complain because it's exclusive to the tournament winners. There were complaints already when they introduced PvP season titles with AP attached to them, to the point where they decided to remove it.
---
It still awards the skin as well, so the comparison is a bit off. They get the skin, and those who do care for other content also get something they can put to use there. Might also be used as a "hey you can use that in PvE/WvW, isn't that great, go check it out" though I doubt that's the main incentive.
---
Other PvP rewards don't require you to win a tournament, they can be easily obtained by some (un)ranked play.
---
i was once top 5 on li half a year ago and did quite some low manning, thanks i know.  
---
and yes i am talking about visual clutter, my point still stands. if not everyone is running arround like headless chickens but balling the right way there is a shitton of effects in the same place so there is a shitton of clutter. with exp you see the tells yes...doesn't make the clutter less of a problem and my point still stands.
---
Very good! Thank you very much! 
---
Similar timeframe, but much less gold :D
---
GW2Eff says account value at 38.6k and without gemstore 21.8k - I bought gems once or so, though they were stupidly cheap back then and converted them to gold (or rather: to silver).
---
I never grinded and have all the equipment I need and still find things / skins to strive for. GW2 is awesome in that regard!
---
Street sharks opening theme intensifies
---
Holy shit Tekkit, thank you so freaking much. This is amazing!
---
I love WvW and usually end up with 5-10g per hour (says GW2Eff Farming Tracker) while having fun and actually playing the game I want.
---
I sometimes run DS, Tahrir, Istan, SW and Fracs whatever I want to but never with the idea to grind gold.
---
I know lots of people here are done with the game but I would like to see Guild Wars 1 released again with some kind of progression system in place. Lord of the Rings Online Legendary Server, Rift Prime, World of Warcraft Classic, Oldschool Runescape, Lineage 2 classic... People love this stuff. In many cases love it more than the current "better" games. I would love to play the game again with "new expansion" every 3-12 months. Current game is barren player wise and there's just too much content and achievements. 
---
And you still play together? In what game did you guys meet?
---
Oh, definitely. The fact that DoA records got broken using what seem like very normal tactics is mindboggling. I saw the 16min video and it blew my mind that they did that with such casual tactics.
---
It just sucks, because I loved to tank DoA, used to do record runs, the whole shebang. Trench tanking was actually quite fun (both bastard trench and 4-lord trench), so it's unfortunate that fun was taken away.
---
Druid is actually the worst healer out of all options. The thing it does best is provide boons to 10 players (regeneration, might, vigor, protection, maybe fury) and other good boons to 5 players (swiftness, fury). Druid is the best buffer. 
---
I mostly play healscourge in raids as a 2nd healer next to a druid. Works perfectly and is a lot of fun. There is only 1 encounter where having 2 druids is "a must" because the group has to split. 
---
Reached out to them! Thanks :)
---
Have you considered the possibility that they have switched manpower to developing the next expansion? Similar to how content stagnated before HoT but more controlled.
---
You'll never see snow sharks coming
---
Tower of thrones.
---
Can't decide on whether I should focus on holo or Chrono for PVE contents like fractals, general exploring and the distant future raiding. I love my dps on my holo and the whole transformation gig but I find myself going down a lot on fractals. What do you advise?
---
I agree, funnily enough, i can't find a proper pve open world build for my mesmer tho XD
---
Yup. Druid is a good-enough healer with a ton of boons and effects. It also interlocks neatly with warrior and two chronos so that it's an efficient combination.
---
Pretty sure they didn't say directly... Mike Z said something like "As we transition to Season 5", which internally has already happen for two Living World teams, as they both created two episodes for Season 4 and are working on Season 5 right now. On one of the first Guild Chats of Path of Fire (so late 2017 or early 2018) they also said that having that extra six months (EP6 - 3 months - Expansion - 3 months - EP1) allows the teams to slow down, restructure if needed etc.
---
I am confident that Season 4 will end with an announcement and three or four months (the usual cadence) after EP6 Expansion 3 will release. Let's see if I'm right in a few months, nothing is certain now. !remindme 6 weeks

This really is the type of question you ask yourself not other people. I personally don't forget things that easily so my answer would be: No, log a character and start playing the game.   
---
No, i feel like they cut manpower from the company and decided to focus on the gemstore instead. That's what i feel.
---
We don't play as much together.
---
We met through SecondLife originally back when we were in college (I am East Coast, she is Midwest US).
---
We played a lot of different games together: World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, etc. Even more recently we've played Stardew Valley co-op together.
---
I think just through time, and us being busy (I work full time, she's in school and working, etc.) we don't get to game as much anymore but we are still incredibly close. We usually visit each other once a year, and do a weekend of shows and junk food and we talk almost every day via  text.
---
The one that I'm surprised doesn't get talked about much is Female Sylvari being Fem Shep from Mass Effect. Jennifer Hale.
---
&gt; Huge kudos to to that one dev who pours time over gw1 in their spare time.
---
I mean, the engine code for both games is basically the same.
---
^^/s ^^or ^^maybe ^^not
---
No no no, please no water. 
---
Power chrono
---
I have not done it yet cuz I don’t really know how but I’ve heard if shield DH pushing people off with that too :)
---
OP titled his posts "fashion sets". I hence assumed he was new and listed out both options.
---
You guys downvote all you want, but honestly i dont see myself having done any damage to OP in this circumstance, neither do i see the point in immediately harping on the terribleness of outfits.
---
&gt; That doesn't matter at all, Spellbreaker could be the objective worse spec in the game for all content
---
Which he is for PvE.
---
&gt;but as long as it's capable of doing the story missions or doing meta events in the new maps then it's far from worthless
---
Yes it is, it offers nothing existing specs don't offer.
---
&gt;because it's unique playstyle, whether it's actually good or not, got plenty of people to sink hundreds of hours into a newly made Warrior just because they enjoyed the spec.
---
You're talking about your ass. It's unique playstyle is litterally nonexistent in PvE.
---
Spellbreaker's entire playstyle is about 1v1 boon manipulation, which does not exist in PvE. What exactly are you enjoying about stripping boons from mobs that don't have boons?
---
&gt;Also, Spellbreaker is borderline broken in general PvE. Most overworld mobs have very easy to read telegraphs that Spellbreaker can always block with zero effort, 
---
I mean sure, yeah, you definitely will fit through short doors easier, but it's better to retain the ability to walk instead.
---
&gt;and has some very reliable self-healing potential with trait synergies. 
---
No it doesen't, his self healing is insanely shit for PvE.
---
The only self heal he has is on his offhand dagger (and only when it crits) whose abilities have a 12 (which only hits 1 target) and 20 second cooldowns respectively.
---
&gt;It's probably one of the most reliable open world builds in the game, and the best one Warrior gets.
---
I don't know what you're high on, but I'd love some.
---
tilt your head a little.
---
i met m best friend through a MMO years ago, last summer a was his best man
---
and it just started when we were joking on TS and realising we were in the same city
---
the following dialog was short but effective :D
---
\- me: "Beer ?"
---
\- him: "Beer."
---
Tl;dr pve and pvp are the same except in one you fight real players and in the other you don't
---
Tilt your head a little.
---
I love that particular bit of ambient chatter. 
---
"Burn me...it's a stingray"
---
I do remember though when I made a Dervish build purely for padcamping in JQ. 
---
Able to put out absolutely ridiculous AoE cleave damage, so I was legitimately able to spawncamp as people came out. 
---
I miss that class. 
---
I think there are several reasons.
---
 - In an infinite fight condi beats power. But it has (a lot sometimes) of ramp up time, to apply all these conditions. This means that on bosses that rarely phase condi is in theory stronger than power.
---
 - Power classes all(?) depend on scholar rune uptime, which is harder on bosses with a lot of aoe (like mathias/ cairn).
---
 - The more a boss moves and uses abilities the better torment and cofusion are (as you said).
---
 - Not only the bloodstone shield interrupts rotations, so do the other mechanics. You have to regularly move to the border ofthe arena, and split up, to not kill everyone. Power classes are in general more dependent on a fixed rotation, than condi.
---
 - There is no need for cleave or burst damage during this fight. Which would make power classes stronger (like on most encounters).
---
Condition classes tend to be less auto-attack reliant for their DPS, instead loading a lot onto the boss quickly and having to wait for it to tick through.
---
The lack of long invuln phases that drop all condis helps, but it's more about that quick application - condition classes lose less dps from doing the mechanics than power classes, and there is a lot to do that can't be delegated away on Matthias.
---
I'm still stuck in my ways of only farming istan haha. Realistically the Nerf itself didn't hurt istan nearly as much as the amount of people that quit. Less people means less multimap and slower farms. You can still make a good amount of gold there, plus I think istan is actually fun XD
---
You'll get tons of tomes of experience playing a max level character, don't buy it. You get 1 for each expansion you buy anyway
---
ABs are responsible for my introduction to PvP in MMOs. 
---
I somehow ended up getting into the [any] alliance back when it owned Cavalon, despite barely knowing what I was doing. I was required to donate 10k Luxon faction per day for membership, and I just... started doing that daily. 
---
Another minor point is his, more or less, constant movement helping Torment tick higher. Plus his fast attack range.
---
The preferred classes there, being Condi Mirage, Condi Engi/Holo and Condi Daredevil are also builds that move with him.
---
He can move out of things like Ele Sword 2 and Guardian Symbols, but the previously mentioned builds are all very mobile with little to no aoe fields that last.
---
Eh, it's strange to see that male Asura voice actor mainly features in various anime dubs.
---
If you're on NA, I'd be glad to throw you an invite to my guild. We do multiple weekly raid trainings and have people who would be happy to help you with your build to make you raid ready (like others were saying, exotic armor is definitely fine).

---
I got server stop the login information or something. Everytime. But only one time after login. No matter what im doing ingame it just kick me (not closes the game) and i have to close it and open it again. After that it works fine but its really annoying it has a daily basis of random disconect for the lulz
---
Good points, especially 2 and 4. I might underestimate the relative impact of rotation disturbance between power and condi.
---
I mean Anet literally said 4 leads directly into 5 with no expansion in between. 
---
But there's no need to stack up on testimonies (or proofs) if the testimonies you can get will only ever affect core, HoT, or PoF hero challenges. Might as well just use them now and not purchase anymore.
---
Because once that expansion hits and you use them, you'll just either get the core/HoT/PoF HPs or be refunded the related proofs just like now. Instead, there'll be a new, third, type of testimonies added specifically for the new expansion; there *most likely* will be a new type of Proofs added as well, given how they handled proofs with PoF's release.
---
One can wish but don’t be too hopeful. 
---
wow, amazing work!
---
Not to mention in the first kill, the Holo would have gotten away 100% if it were not for the Fresh Weaver which deleted his health. 
---
Also took much much longer to arrive tho
---
For Rev:
---
&gt;Having 2 different "states" feels kinda awkward to me, first of all.
---
You get used to it.
---
&gt;Also not having a "press this buttom and heal" healing skill felt weird. 
---
Dwarf and Demon have normal heal skills. Glint can be a full heal if you use it right, baiting people into landing their full burst into healing you feels great. You can dodge/evade/block for a good 10 seconds anyway so you should have to eat tons of damage in the first place
---
&gt;The major issues I had were that this class has no endurance regeneration from what I've seen, 
---
Stop using upkeep skills or high cost energy skills. It regens on its own pretty fast if you're using nothing and you're at a full +5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. Also swapping legends after using up all your energy should be a good part of your rotation.
---
&gt;and very few dodges outside that.
---
So you don't use the Shiro dodge that gives back half a dodge on its own? You don't use staff 3 and 5 in between, no energy sigil, or even sword 3? You can dodge/block/evade for days on rev, it's what people love to rage at rev players for for years. 
---
&gt;no condi cleanse.
---
Cleansing Channel, Cleansing sigil,  Riposting Shadows, Staff 4, or even Leadership runes? Keep in mind glint heal works on condis too.
---
The joke is that the games so poorly optimized you won't get perfect max settles. In reality though anything new will max out the game, just don't' expect 60fps+ consistently. I'm personally not going to recommend a laptop, mainly because I stay well away from them. Really comes down to your budget and do you want to play other games. Because if so, shoot for something that can do that.

We both were in a clan (I think the game was Crysis 2) whose members were from the country I live in. Back when we were in that clan most of us were around the ages of 12-13. Some of us bonded and stayed friends after that clan disbanded and kept playing other games together (mostly fps and mmos).
---
I brought those friends eventually to GW2 when it launched and since 2012 we're playing it together (some of us quit and came back at some points though).
---
 After 2-3 years of playing together we decided to meet IRL, and since then l my best friend and I keep in touch and meet every weekend. It's not too hard to keep in touch because we live 20 minutes apart by car.
---
Oof ... Im on EU. But thanks anyways.
---
now that would be an interesting WoT alternative universe, aes sedai fighting with other channelers with swords and interrupting their weaves :D
---
Oh really? My guild said the exact opposite.
---
Please tell me more! 
---
You dont need shit for pvp, nor for wvw where it hasnt really changed in ages.  
---
pve? yes, if you play mesmer. nope for the rest.  
---
The game is shitting out ascended stuff in almost every scenario if it isnt afking or braindead farm.  
---
The argeument stands: either you are a troll or somebody who doesn't want to put in work.
---
Legend swap is also a stunbreak. And you won't have to break stun if you use riposting shadows in the first place. 
---
And yeah, don't burn your most powerful defensive skills offensively. 
---
You shouldn't be attempting to land staff 2.
---
But you should be trying to get off staff 4, ideally in a light or water field, that way it'll clear 3 or give a good heal.
---
The shield will always favor condi classes since they can keep ramping up while power classes are in stand-by mode. You are likely to see easily 6-10 shields per fight, depending on group DPS, which equals to about 30+ seconds of total invulnerability that is partially bypassed by condi classes, but mean a complete stop for power ones.
---
If we add all these to Scholar uptime, the length of the fight without stop for condi classes, and taking into account the boss moving, which affects quite the spectrum of power DPS, you're better off playing condi, and even better, mirage.
---
Of course you can play power. I've played power lots of timesbecause I find them more interesting, but also condi, and I find it extremely difficult to keep up with mirages using a power class.
---
&gt;I'm also a little stumped on how to retrieve the Mordrem body pieces. What would be classed as the bosses? 
---
This refers to the four Breach bosses and the three VW bosses. So in a great map, you can get two mordrem pieces every meta.
---
Legendaries may also count but I've never used an extractor before killing one so I'm unsure.
---
gw2 efficiency say i got like 12279g of gemstore upgrades [doesnt count black lion keys and restyle kit i guess], but i bought gems few times and in the last year..
---
doesnt seems a lot for 6 years of playtime to be honest.
---
hahaha, you made me laugh. I am indeed very lazy in leveling up another characters after I have like 10. :&lt;
---
If only salary payed OT at my work...  I’d grind extra hours.
---
So the **208 AP for finishing the Heroic Dragonsblood Weapons** is not enough?  ANET supplied us with a huge amount of AP point availability through just this one collection and is doing an excellent job of addressing weapon and armor skins obtainable from in game content instead of only from the Gemstore (which was never the case despite all the internet trolls claiming this).    
---
i thought i was the only one with this hairstyle, all the other charrs are Super Saiyan
---
You make zero sense and are wrong explain yourself 
---
I am burned out from WvW, and I don't play Pvp, what else can I do to get more tome other than waiting for the daily rewards?
---
You'll have to repost that without names, see you after your post gets deleted.
---
How can anyone be this dumb? Engineer uses technology,  warriors don't have magic they have physical attacks give me a break a standard spells word uses elemental magic. 
---
Can you actually get back your deleted characters? How many times can I do that? I only have the name and the class that I wish to restore, is it possible?
---
U said fire your literally lying now. 
---
I saw the name and couldn't resist. 
---
Maybe just get a second set of gear for one of your existing characters and repurpose them? 
---
"delusional" :D Nice word used :)
---
Casting means magic though technically 
---
You might wanna reconsider posting names here, and focus on personal gameplay. This will in return put you higher in ranks and away from afk crowd. 
---
Unbound Magic harvesting tool gathers all hits in a node in a single strike I think.
---
Landshark, pretty common in Arah. :P
---
my gf has this one: HP OMEN 17-AN134NG
---
like the rest said: you wont have 60 fps on max setting on any pc. but it runs smooth with that one
---
I can't help but think that some of these harvesting tool animations would make great abilities for elite specs. Rangers summoning swarms of butterflies, wasps, and fireflies (I donno do weird things where we look at the other side of nature where you infest your enemy with a parasite and they burst out as bugs), eles becoming some kind of space wizard using the cosmic animation set, necros re-purposing toxic alliance stuff.
---
You can restore a deleted character, yes. Talk to support and give them info about the character, maybe include when you deleted them?  I don't think there's a concrete number of characters you can restore but usually if you're polite and don't make a habit of it, they'll honor a request. 
---
GW1 is *nothing* like the Soulsborne series and I would not consider them unforgiving in the slightest. Hard yes, but not unforgiving. 
---
checkmate, everybody is a commander in gw2
---
what about it? you can cast ranged magic and you can cast melee magic in gw2. nobody was nitpicking.
---
Pick a lower tier server, being in T1 sucks right now for roaming. T3 might be the sweet spot but do more research.
---
I never said they were alike. And unforgiving in the sense that you have to do the whole thing again if you die in reaction to the first post.
---
some people can respect the success of others, you see
---
I got a legendary for killing [Zhaitan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Victory_Token)
---
I can't believe they stole our favorite rat baby girl. I'm reporting them to the Six Gods. 
---
&gt;years ago
---
It was June last year, so about 8 months ago.
---
&gt; Last I checked, Warrior doesn't have any other spec that lets it dual wield daggers and jump around like a Thief.
---
What about wielding dual daggers is beneficial if they don't do anything useful?
---
&gt;I'm not sure how I can make my point any clearer. I am not talking about Spellbreaker mechanically, whether it's actually a strong spec or not is completely irrelevant to most people's opinion on it.
---
&gt;I know it's easy to get trapped in the reddit echo chamber, but Fashion Wars 2 isnt a joke. The vast majority of players don't give a shit about what's meta, they only care about aesthetic and what's fun. 
---
Here's the thing about "fun" and spellbreaker. 
---
90% of his abilities do not function in PvE. 
---
For all intents and purposes, he might as well not have them.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker gives Warrior a new aesthetic and it got thousands of people to start playing a Warrior and sinking an additional hundred hours into the game.
---
What aesthetic? A new icon and a bunch of abilities that don't function outside PvP?
---
Can you tell me what are you basing on that an objectively useless spec for PvE got thousands of people to play warrior?
---
&gt;I just don't think you can call it worthless when it was an objective success in almost every respect.
---
A success in...what respect? It's trash for all PvE to the point where warrior might as well have no gotten a new spec.
---
The only thing it's a success at is PvP.
---
&gt;Maybe I'm a few patches behind, but did they just completely remove Magebane Tether and Might Makes Right? I know they nerfed the endurance gain on it a while ago because of how broken the combo was, but even with the infinite dodges nerfed it's still like having a second Healing Signet equipped.
---
So, they entirety of your healing now comes from magebane teather and might makes right? This is the super highly sustainable build?
---
You know, it's not just what you get, it's also what you sacrifice, an entire traitline is hardly worth giving up for this.
---
&gt;You can even take Restorative Strength to turn Healing Signet into an actual heal skill if you wanted, or you could just use Natural Healing which is absurdly good in PvE. A massive, chunky heal coupled with a full condi cleanse on a relatively low cooldown? The trade-off of removing your own boons is trivial considering Spellbreaker constantly reapplies them anyway.
---
Natural healing isn't warrior's only strong heal. To the limit heals a similar ammount and refills adrenaline and endurance without requiring you to give up an entire traitline for it.
---
&gt;I have absolutely no clue what you're talking about when you say Spellbreaker is shit for open worldYou can ask around, I'm pretty sure I've seen more people with my opinion than yours. Hell, I even distinctly remember WoodenPotatoes talking how good Spellbreaker was in general PvE at one point. He literally goes "Yeah I thought they'd be pretty bad in PvE because boon rip makes it sound like a PvP spec but damn their sustain is insane."
---
But like I said, maybe I'm a few patches behind and Spellbreaker got super nerfed while I wasn't looking.
---
&gt;I've spent hours trying to solo bounties or challenge fights across all of my characters and my Spellbreaker is consistently the only one with enough sustain and defense to kill anything harder than the low tiers.
---
Can you give me an example of something you can solo as spellbreaker than you can't as someone else so I can try it for myself?
---
While we're at it, send me your build for it as well.
---
He could have, didn't think about it. Since that would be some advanced code to have a bot run character around and participate, never crossed my mind! Gonna watch out for that in future.
---
In WoW people that are extremely toxic get punished if player that reported shows displesure and has screenshot as proof, ban is usually 3-7 days depending on the offense.
---
I provided screenshots in my online ticket I sent to Anet.
---
I have many suggestions on how to fix PvP, I'd say it's a lot better than WoW just because of the playstyle, it's really fastpaced and enjoyable, shame it's ruined by people that decide to grief.
---
I'll try to reach out to Anet.
---
Thank you for your response sir.
---
you get 96 AP for all the chasing tales achievements...
---
&gt;I agree that Confusion needs fixed however, Mirage needs nerfed unless we want to pretend that 40k+ DPS on SH and Cairn and double the damage potential of other specs on LT is fine.
---
No, it isn't. And simply making confusion work like bleeding will make it virtually impossible for mirage to ever reach those numbers again. Problem solved. Again, the issue isn't with mirage and again, Anet sooner or later will want to give confusion to another build too. Talking about this as if it's a mirage-specific issue is super short-sighted, as I said before.
---
&gt;However, thanks for the personal attacks. They added nothing to the conversation but if they made you feel better, you do you.
---
I said nothing that wasn't a conclusion based on what you said. When I bring up confusion and you start going "lalalaalla, it's all mirage and nothing else lalalala" and then go off on a tangent about mesmer in general, of course I would call you biased. Because you sure as hell came off that way. If you think that's actually a personal attack though, well, you must live in a strange world.
---
Also. I can't believe that Taimi's voice actress IS Jimmy Neutron. 
---
you are a loser :)
---
Point 1 isn't really true. While the Devs have stated that condi should do more damage long-term than power, they have consistently made power classes deal more than condi. Looking at the SC benchmarks for example, only berserker and renegade are still increasing their dps by the time the golem dies and berserker probably would never top Weaver.
---
Here we go again. *zips pants*
---
Forgive me, I may be missing your point but :
---
&gt;even tho cairn is one of the easiest bosses ever, doing him with postprocessing on is the definition of visual clutter.
---
You seem to imply that Cairn (and maybe to some extend the other raid bosses) is the worst offender in terms of visual clutter. So I assumed it might have been low experience and pointed it might have been the overwhelmed effect.
---
Now you clarify that you have experience in raid, so I can assume you're no longer overwhelmed. So tell me: in which alternate reality is the visual clutter on any raid boss worse than any open world boss?
---
Also just to make sure : I agree with you that clutter is a problem in general. But some places (high population density) are more affected than others.
---
I like how people who've probably never played GW1 are telling you you're wrong.
---
GW1 just isn't enjoyable in this day and age. It's very dated and extremely frustrating to play nowadays. Having to do a one-hour mission over from the beginning doesn't want me to play more, it makes me want to quit and play something where I can actually accomplish something and have fun. Because wiping on the same extremely frustrating and stressful and most of all boring mission several times in a row is not fun. Prophecies is just boring mission after boring mission. 
---
And honestly? Anyone who calls GW1  agood game has too much nostalgia in their brain. GW1 is simply *not* a good game. It wants to be a single player experience but it's wearing a MMO's skin, and fails at both. Down the line it's bizarre it got popular enough to get a sequel.
---
"cHaNgE yOuR sKiLls" HAHAHAHAHA. NO. I haven't even the content yet how the fuck was I supposed to know since I have a staunch policy of not reading guides unless I get stuck, maybe if I could during mission so I don't have to waste 55 minutes to get back to the final 5  minutes I wiped at. 
---
Vaniel isn't even a player, it's a well known bot (I assume stolen account based on it's AP) that has been mass reported by people all season with nothing to show for it. When Anet don't even deal with bots, what do you figure are the chances they'll deal with just regular, run of the mill toxic players?
---
Unfortunately that is what you stepped into. I don't mean to discourage anyone from getting into PvP but you do so with the understanding the game mode is barely supported anymore. 
---
The fur texture is really nice!
---
Why would there be an FPS cost? The only things I really see are fields on the ground, maybe 5 people due to limited player models, and the target. My game runs smooth as silk as long as I change that preset, and the only thing I don't like is having to return everything back to how I like it when the meta's done.
---
&gt; People need to be punished for griefing so there won't be any match ruining. 
---
You have report, use it. Nothing more can be recommended, if you waste your time on chasing them down and punching them in the face, your time to play pvp will only decrease. But it's is not a way to cure the problem at all, this is different subject now, so maybe later when i have time.
---
what do you mean surprisingly well? as in shocking that such a random build can actually do something?
---
cuz builds that do great become meta you know..that's how this works
---
Yeah I am in T1 now and it sucks.  Is it possible though to find a server with a high population but lots of roamers as well?  Being forced to roam because there are only 5 people on the map isnt exactly what I'm looking for either.
---
They're far too different to compare them properly. However, I do believe GW1 succeeded at doing his thing far better than GW2 has done his so far.
---
[Just some slight, minor speculation](#s "Joko's followers steal Aurene's body, they end up resurrecting Joko but not Aurene. You get to see Aurene again but it's clear that it can't be her because her body is still there, dead. You learn that Aurene tried to work around her own prophecy of her death by actually acknowledging it would be impossible to avert, and using the mists and her visions to groundhog day the best outcome she could get before she died, you try to work against Kralk in a way were you actually have to ally with Joko, who shares a bested interest because now Kralk has consumed his power and thus his hold on his empire, but where you eventually end up facing a completely new enemy from the weakened Mists. You are trolled by Anet by how there should be possibilities to raise Aurene back from the dead several times, but only long after the current predicament, after an attempt of bringing Aurene backs that risks the existence of her being, after she is no longer that necessary deus ex machina to avert the destruction of Tyria, do you get the last opportunity to bring her back for good when facing the last Elder dragon.)
---
Just here to make your day a little more annoying, why ?
---
I've looked up the condi benchmarks on sc, the following condi classes increase their dps by the time the golem dies (ie. the dps for the last fifth is higher than those before):
---
* [scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/)
---
* [mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/)
---
* [engineer](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/engineer/condition/)
---
* [holosmith](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/condition/)
---
* [soulbeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/)
---
* [renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/)
---
* [berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/condition/)
---
While the increase for most is not insane, it still means that their damage after 2 minutes of combat is still increasing, while power classes usually have a high burst and then decrease.
---
I just assumed that it would generally be the case, from what I saw during raids, but it seems like there are some pretty strong builds, like [power deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/rifle/), that are still stronger.
---
I'd still stick to the general statement that the longer the fight the likelier it is that a condition build will beat a power build.
---
If they don’t do an expansion then this game won’t last another 5 years. 
---
[you sure about that?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Testimony_of_Heroics)
---
&gt;personal stability.
---
what the fuck did you just tell me to bring you piece of shit  i don't need your fucking advice you nobgobbling piece of uterus 
---
Ugg why did I sell that Orichalcum home instance node years back. I think I spent the gold on something stupid.
---
hahahaha
---
[Was looking at this page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Proof_of_Heroics).
---
Point remains though, the currencies won't be usable for next expansions' HPs based on past experience.
---
For both open world and fractals, it’s best to play something you’re comfortable on.  Going down in fractals is an issue of messing up mechanics more often than not.  I wouldn’t let that push you away from Holo, just keep practicing and over time you’ll get better and better.
---
As for raids, Chrono is the most sought after class, but is also the hardest class to raid with.  Messing up your rotation punishes your entire party’s DPS.  On top of that, support classes like Chrono tend to be responsible for most boss mechanics. There are certainly people who learn raids by playing Chrono, but there is a ton of weight on your shoulders by doing so.
---
I normally suggest learning raids with DPS.  Get comfortable with 1 versatile meta power build and 1 versatile meta Condi build. Holo has both a strong power and Condi build (although its Condi build is pretty hard to learn).
---
In my case its from memory. To many hours spent...
---
For those wondering, the first guy is [Kanaxai](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kanaxai), from the Deep.
---
I think GW1 is fine as it is. Even the graphics, a remaster could be nice, but it could change the aesthetics far too much and leave a bitter taste.
---
I would love to see Beyond finished, with campaigns for both Elona and Far Shiverpeaks. The story of Gwen and Ebonhawke always felt like was planned for beyond, but never made it.
---
It's easy to find people to do them, so don't be shy :D.
---
Bring back open world arenas too! I really miss exploring those parts of the map lol.
---
You can't jump in APRGs either.
---
we dont need no legendary rewards, because WE are legendary
---
I’ll be watching this thread closely because I don’t have ANY infinite tools whatsoever, and wonder which are the best to buy. Thanks for posting these questions... 
---
Agreed, although not that many condi builds are currently better than power builds IMO. I think the biggest power killswitch would be the bloodstone shield. Condis can keep stacking without a real loss for them or their damage potential while power classes basically blow 4 sec of high damage skills into nothing.
---
If this was any other game, i'd assume you're a troll. But considering it's GW2, I'll assume your entitlement and stupidity is genuine. 
---
&gt; Maybe 2021? By the time we’re down to about 6 active servers.
---
I hate that you may be right. I played GW2 for years as a primary WvW player and was in one of the bigger guilds more active guilds. I log in now and my once active server is dead. and there are typically no more than a handful of players in my guild logged in at any time. I thought with the update that may bring some kind of resurgence, but now I feel like whatever they do, it may be too little too late.
---
GW2 had something great with it's Real vs Realm system. I feel like it got tossed to the side because they couldn't really monetize WvW since we don't buy a lot of gems, compared to people that play other game modes. I hope that some other game comes out and puts some effort into a good RvR system.
---
The additional damage wouldn't be so bad if the flanking condition weren't so lenient.
---
Gear in PvP, unlike in PvE, like chests and boots don't actually give you the attributes. In your PvP build you select an Amulet that will give you all of the Attributes/stats you want in different combinations. Which means, stats do matter, a lot actually but you don't get them only through your amulet (in PvP).
---
If you choose Precision, Ferocity and Power you are better at doing direct damage than condition damage since you are not focusing on any condition relevant attribute like condition damage and condition duration. Precision is good but only really valuable for condition builds when you have runes/sigils that proc on critical hits.
---
All that means that you first should select a build you want to play, then pick an amulet that supports this build (condition focused build = condition focused amulet).
---
I wouldn't call one fairly experienced raider if you don't understand why condi is more beloved on bosses which has no phases. 
---
The biggest selling point is that Matthias does not lose his conditions during shield phase ( unlike VG or Gorse and other bosses with phases) matthias is kinda like cairn, but one of them has more mechanics.  
---
Playing with 5 condi dps on Matthias doesn't neccesserly mean it will be cleaner kill but it will take boss down faster( same reason why power dps with huge bursts are meta on KC). You can kill Matthias with power dps just fine, but people who do FC they'll always prefer roles which will help to bring boss down faster
---
and if someone starts calling you names for not switching, it means that he/she is an a-hole and you shouldn't bother with them 
---
Looks like a screenshots. Pretty good job.
---
It's not like you can spend them on anything else, lul.
---
This game and its community aren't exactly competitive. In fact, you'll notice that even most of this subreddit at best doesn't like PvP or competitions. Look at any of the tournament of legends (an upcoming PvP tourny) threads on this subreddit and you'll find plenty of hate towards PvP / competition / anything to do with pvp. 
---
As a result PvP has lost most of its healthy playerbase. These players have been replaced by mediocre carebears that will gladly AFK when things aren't going their way. They're less popular at higher ranks. NA PvP is also just dead, entirely. 
---
The combat system is AMAZING for PvP, but the community hates it and anet will not maintain it. The toxicity and awfulness will not improve because most players don't want any improvements to go towards PvP. 
---
likewise there is no reason to instantly blow them on HPs you cannot use right now anyway. they offer more options while in your wallet, more potential. even if you're never gonna utilize any of that potential, the ability to convert them into PoF/HoT/core HPs - which, again, cover more than a whole other elite spec - doesn't vanish if a new expansion comes around.
---
&gt;The Lakeside County gate to the Northlands will stay open twice as long when its lever is activated.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Feedback:Game\_updates/20180606](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Feedback:Game_updates/20180606)
---
Here you go.
---
Sure, but pointless to save for future HPs... And little point in not completing hero challenges now, either to have the HPs asap next expansion, or for mapping.
---
You need one of the three campaigns (Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall) and the expansion Eye of the North. That's because Eye of the North gives you access to the Hall of Monuments and as a pure expansion, it can't be played without the base game.
---
If you buy the full thing, all 3 campaigns and the expansion, 11 points in the hall of monuments are trivial to get just by playing through it once. That'll get you the whole set of heritage armor and a few weapon skills, including the Fiery Dragon Sword (Sohothin/Magdaer).
---
To do that,
---
* Play though the main story of all 3 campaigns and of the expansion
---
* Unlock the hero M.O.X.
---
* Get the Celestial Pig miniature by playing a specific quest during Canthan New Year (right now, or a different miniature next year)
---
* Play the War in Kryta story and get a free Oppressor weapon
---
* Buy any elite armor set and dedicate it. This is the only part that costs gold, 60 platinum + whatever materials that specific armor requires (the head piece is optional). You should easily get that just by playing the content once unless you spend all your money on runes and insignias for your heroes.
---
If you want to keep going after that, there's more easy points. You can get 3 more by completing just two titles and some are pretty easy (for example, each campaign has a title for completing all the story missions with bonus objectives). You can tame a rare pet (the Imperial Phoenix is easy to acquire) as a primary or secondary Ranger and train it to level 20 for an additional 2 points. You can get a free Tormented weapon by completing the annual Wayfarer's Reverie (just once per account ever) for another point. That'll get you up to 17 points, which is more than half of the rewards, 3 titles, and 150 AP.
---
pvp is dead,issue you mention here was in game since start,no one was/will be ever banned or suspended for afking,bcs no1 care and there is no way you can proof they are afk on purpose. this is chill game for casuals,so ppl tend to go away to play with kids in middle of game often.
---
Yes you are definitely right.  The skeptic in me just says look at what happened with Diablo making a mobile game.  From a business point of view, if a mobile game makes significantly more money than gw2, even if they continue gw2 they might start decreasing it's budget in favor of pouring more resources into the more profitable revenue stream.
---
To be fair, it could also turn out that the mobile game was successful enough that they could spend some of the extra cash on gw2, but I kinda doubt this will happen.
---
We ran Urban Battleground and it sure seemed like the oil spill at Dulfy's gate benefited from the increased damage. Not sure about the ballistas and arrow carts, but it seems likely. Not quite sure it should be that way, but the solution was to fight with our backs to the gate and take out the oil first - which is a big problem since the mobs are coming from your back side while targeting.  
---
Mentioned elsewhere in this thread is the thought it seemed like the "flanking" definition was lenient, I'd agree. Seems flanking means "not in front", which translates to if they're in your hitbox, they're flanking you.  
---
As for "10 times harder", nah, just make sure you're always facing the mob. It might make scenarios like the courtyard mob rushes in Urban a tense situation, but you're just going to have to bite off smaller chunks. Now Outflanked on Siren's Reef with it's two approaches is a horrid situation.
---
As for an instability needing work, Birds is the most hated - especially in areas already requiring a lot of dodging (Amala with Birds and Convergence). Birds and Frailty is a deadly combination against dps Guardians.
---
That's an interesting way to see it. I think I would have a better time with actual players advancing at the same pace as me, like 14 years ago when I was playing.
---
As it is, GW1 feels like a wasteland and I'm alone with a bunch of AI. Not really the most exciting content when the game can be hard and confusing.
---
Power chrono is the best solo class atm tho (if you care about time that is) it gets 25 might/quickness/für's permanent too
---
Although power reaper might be the newbie-friendler build, since it gives itself all the good boons as well And can facetank a lot more dmg
---
It used to be better but at the same time, worse.
---
AFK players, bots and trolls really wasn't much of a thing in pvp until \~2 years ago. And the reason was that pvp had no reward associated to it. The only reason to play was for the fun of it. It also didn't have any ranking system or in-game tournament, so there were a lot less toxicity because no one really cared much about winning / losing.
---
The leagues made everything more competitive and so more toxic, and brough actual rewards into the game mode which also brough in players who don't care about pvp. But at the same time, the league system adds a lot of value to the pvp.
---
As for reports, it's currently inefective. The issue is that everyone and their mother just report anyone for completely retarded reasons. You get reported for knowing how to play, you get reported when trying to give genuine advice no matter how polite you are, you get reported for making one bad decision, you get reported for playing a non-meta build... Every legitimate report gets burried under that mass of stupidy.
---
Software development is hard. I can't imagine how dealing with a system like this is dealing with the worlds of the different players are on.
---
Your piece of advice is amazing! Spirit of Gw2 community will be alive forever if there stay the members like you.
---
I'm anything but a newbie, but I'll remember your advice as well :)
---
My volatile mining tool only does it 3 times... -.-
---
Find a static then. You should not design around how bad players are. 
---
I believe that those tools that had special effects (for example faster harvesting), got updated version that actually contains the glyph (and if you had that tool, you got updated tool with slot + glyph ). 
---
The difference is that now you can take the glyph out and put it into different tool. Also you can transmute the skins basically for free so I see all the positive changes.
---
Yet, yes, glyphs are still quite rare and valuable thing to get. I don't see it as so wrong though, for infinite uses upgrade that (some of them) can generate you bonus source of income. 
---
It's very true by your ignorant logic dragons aren't dragons in elder scrolls and should be called something else considering all fantasy derives from. Tolkein and legends throughout our history the same rules apply magic id magic. If someone can summon the elements from their hands that's natural innate magic. When someone uses science and technology they are using tools to use magic. How can you not get this. It's like you this is the only fantasy you have ever known. 
---
Your statement was: "You cannot compare PvP tournaments to PvE."
---
So I did just that.
---
As I see it PvP is not more difficult in and of itself. Even players cannot come up with infinite surprises, so after you learn how to read the minimap, you can anticipate enemy movement. Figuring out what your classes bring to the table is also fairly straightforward. There are many parallels between the two game modes, the main difference being that PvE is generally static. The Tournament is the great alternation between the game modes.
---
And the tournament would be as difficult as a hypothetical PvE tournament, as you have to maintain a winning streak against other players/guilds. Single elimination, raid a dungeon before the other guild does, the last surviving guild/team gets rewards. Soon you'll hear PvEers claiming that raid tournaments can't be compared to PvP, which is still incorrect.
---
I'd even go as far and say PvP is *easier* to get into than raids, but high end PvP is more exclusive than high end raiding.
---
Not sure what your number would be for ruining your wallet, but I have this laptop and it runs it perfectly fine (everything isn't on max, but mostly all high) but it is 15.6" screen [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CWBM1B9/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o06\_\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CWBM1B9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
---
So if you need the 17" then this would be good: [https://www.amazon.com/HP-17-inch-Anti-Glare-i7-8750H-17-an120nr/dp/B07D961VDH/ref=sr\_1\_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1549469271&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=gaming+laptop&amp;refinements=p\_n\_size\_browse-bin%3A7817234011](https://www.amazon.com/HP-17-inch-Anti-Glare-i7-8750H-17-an120nr/dp/B07D961VDH/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1549469271&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=gaming+laptop&amp;refinements=p_n_size_browse-bin%3A7817234011)
---
I agree on the principle, but the thing is that we're not really comparing tvs that have different specifications, use newer technologies etc...
---
The infinite gathering tools that came out in 2013 are still the same as the ones that come out now, they are sold as exactly the same item, just a different skin.
---
Going by the tv example, the tv from 2013 would now cost less than a current tv that comes with a glyph, specifically because it became subpar in the last few years. That said I wouldn't be complaining that I bought my previous tv the same price as the current one, because that's what it was and I was okay with the price back then.
---
It's especially strange in the case of tools that come with an industry glyph, which almost costs as much as the tool itself in gold on the TP.
---
But I'm not even comparing the efficiency or cost of each glyph, I just think it's strange that they would be still be selling glyphless tools and that they didn't introduce replacements that came with any sort of bonus, even silly ones that didn't have any value advantage.
---
Newer glider skins don't come with added bonus or the like, so this is a really blatant power creep the like of which I have never seen (or realized) elsewhere with the gem store.
---
It's the same as if they started to sell a less-copper-fed salvage o tron, which was the same as the current one, but came with a glyph that reduced the cost by 1 copper, and owners of the previous salvage o tron can now buy that glyph on the tp just to make the old one up to speed.
---
Uh... why am I getting downvoted already?
---
Others are sadly. 
---
Honestly, the instability system needs a biiiig overhaul. There shouldn't be damage penalties that stack, such as getting outflanked and boon overload.  
---
The instabilities should be categorized by
---
Damage mod (Things that increase incoming damage Boon Overload and Outflanked along with frailty)
---
Mobility mod (Things that effect movement and positioning ala Social Awkwardness and slippery slope)
---
Mechanic mod (Things that add or change mechanics such as we bleed fire)
---
and only have one of each every fractal.  
---
What's the Hero behavior change for "[Soul Twisting](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Soul_Twisting)" and Ritual Lord?
---
You know a class is broken when it's top tier at every role in the game... Mesmer is the best/only tank, a required support in 99% of cases, a competitive power dps, a competitive condi dps, and pretty much the best PvP class. The only thing they are mediocre at is zerging in WvW and even then they are pretty good roamers.
---
the real answer is that generally condi rotations are not as punishing as power rotations. power rotations often have a pattern of using as many high-damaging skills in a period of a short DPS buff. Look at daredevil/deadeye - using their power signet and then going all out, in daredevil's case they dodge to get another 10% modifier.
---
Weaver wants the extra damage they get from attuning recently.
---
Power chrono wants to be able to Mind Wrack 3x clones off cooldown.
---
A boss like Matthias that becomes periodically invulnerable, or forces you to drop whatever you're doing and leave the middle of the room (poison, corruption, bombs, fire tornadoes getting in your way, spirits getting in your way, etc) absolutely fuck over power rotations. 
---
Condi rotations are not as screwed over like that. Most condi rotas can be summarised more easily by thinking of all the skills they have as belonging to a priority list, and the next skill you use is the most prioritised available one. Of course there's going to be an optimal order you can learn to do it in, but it doesn't really matter if something happens to fuck it up while you're doing it... when you return, you can instantly just continue with where you "should" be in the rotation.
---
By comparison... look what happens if you're a deadeye, and you pop your power signet and then you get corruption. Or you're a DH and you pop your F1 and then a fire tornado spawns inside Matthias' hitbox. Or you're a power soulbeast (not that I'd use that on Matthias anyway, for obvious reasons) and you use "Sic'Em" and then everyone gets timed bombs.
---
If you graphed out power DPS over a fight (look at an arc log by breaking it down to 10s or 30s instead of a full fight) you'll see it goes up and down like crazy... because most power DPS classes have "bursts" they pull off, then downtime, and it balances out over the course of the fight.
---
Condi DPS on the other hand looks more like a gradual increase for the first part of the fight, with very minor fluctuations after that.
---
If a Power DPS loses their burst to a mechanic, they just lost a ton of DPS. If a condi DPS loses their "burst", it's not such a big deal since it's not a particularly large increase in DPS anyway.
---
&gt;They look cool and make you feel like a thief but with warrior's bulk, that's the entirety of my argument here.Yup. Warrior can now equip some trenchcoats via outfits and run around with two Incinerators. I guarantee you this was a big selling point of the spec to a lot of people.
---
There's a reason people look forward to balance patches, and I assure you it's not a cosmetic one.
---
&gt; You still haven't actually provided any evidence of how Spellbreaker is "objectively* useless yet, you just keep going "it's shit lol it's trash" without really going into any detail.
---
I have multiple times.
---
90% of his kit is about boonstrip and 1v1 duels, which has no use in PvE. The majority of his traits do less than nothing, and his weapons lack cleave.
---
Mobs don't behave like players, don't use boons and never 1v1 you. So, a class based in it's absolute entirety around those things has no use because there is nothing to apply those things on.
---
I like how you need evidence of why a 1v1 PvP class is worthless in PvE, as if it needs explaining.
---
&gt;What makes something "worth" giving up, especially in open world PvE? Min/maxed damage traits are a lot less meaningful in a mode where mobs die in three seconds regardless, and conveniences like condi control, boon application, stunbreaks, self-sustain, etc, become luxuries.
---
What makes something worth giving up, is when you get something equaly useful in return.
---
90% of the stuff spellbreaker can do do not apply in PvE.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker is good in open world because it has native access to a lot of conveniences that other professions would have to specifically trait for. It's got fantasic self-boon application to the point where you can wipe yourself with Natural Healing and have 25 stacks of might again 10 seconds later,
---
So, he has a bit of might generation in exchange for giving up an entire trait tree? 
---
Core warrior can already do that without sacrificing his elite tree.
---
&gt;it's got great bulk with warrior's natural health pool and Spellbreaker's multiple sources of self-healing, and it has all of warrior's normal strengths.
---
He has 1 source of self healing, the alternative dagger. The other source relies on something stock warrior already has and can already do, in exchange for litterally giving up an entire trait tree.
---
&gt; it's got access to multiple sources of resistance if you'd rather deal with condis that way
---
Which PvE mobs rarely if ever apply in the first place.
---
&gt; it's got a low CD block with no weapon requirements,
---
You keep calling a block, but it's not a block, it's an aegis that only lasts 1.5 seconds. There's a massive difference between that an a real block.
---
&gt;A good chunk of the bounties I needed for PoF's elite spec weapons. They vary a lot in whether soloing them is at all reasonable, but the ones I did I had the easiest time on Spellbreaker. They just had a much higher threshold for survival, a higher HP pool coupled with reliable blocks and multiple sources of healing you can have coming in at once, it's a very bulky spec.
---
Stock warrior is a bulky spec. Spellbreaker is a normal warrior minus a trait tree plus a single aegis that lasts for 1 second. 
---
&gt;Just because it's main gimmick is a PvP niche doesn't mean that that's all the spec has to offer.
---
No, it's lack of things to offer means that PvP is all it has to offer.
---
Everything that impresses you about it, like survivability and healing, stock warrior already has. 
---
Depends on the dungeon and class you're playing. There are dungeons that attempt to have player gates, but they can sometimes be circumvented by Mesmers or other specific classes.
---
As far as difficulty goes, it shouldn't be too much harder. Dungeons were never updated to take into account the power creep of the elite specs, so as long as you play well and know your class, it shouldn't be impossible to do.
---
That might be helpful for /u/PanopticonMatt :)
---
Thanks for sharing
---
I love being mobile so maybe like the spell cloak in kingdoms of amular? 
---
Same as you, extracted into my GW2 folder.
---
The changes I noticed were that the environments sometimes take longer to load after using waypoints, changing some graphics options causes weird flashes from time to time and some water reflections, smoke effects etc. are bugged. Also, my VRAM usage went from 1GB to close to 2GB so it's pretty apparent it affects stuff in my end.
---
I hope not but many people like to over state clunky allot in games just saying. 
---
i distinctly remember that being a topic, because it was the first pick released after the change, and somehow they forgot about that little detail. sorry bud.
---
T.T of course I would buy the one that's messed up...
---
That's what I get for starting the game 23-24 days ago
---
No problem with the concept of gathering tools with bonuses, I just think it's really silly that tools with no bonus at all are still being sold for the same price as tools with one.
---
The hidden bonuses are somewhat of another debate yeah, and I think the gathering animation times should just be unified.
---
Ty
---
So when looking for Berserker (or any other) gear on TP, don't search by name. Search by stats instead and limit to exotic level 80. This is because named sets are way cheaper than crafted "no name" sets.
---
You can get away with dropping sword in WvW since the damage is imo way too high currently. The problem is a lot of people still have issues dealing damage without sword, but I played rev long before sword became op in terms of damage, so I am still mostly used to shield. 
---
My build used to be about 1/2 Marauder, 3/5 Berserker, and 2/5 Cavalier for about 2.6k armor. What I've done is essentially replace all the berserker gear with diviner's to keep the 2.6k armor. Yes, you lose a little damage, but as a herald player for a long time, I make up for it with high boon uptime and can maintain 25 might easily even without taking Shared Empowerment. It also really helps with other boons like protection and regen.
---
You can not find much discussion because there is not much to discuss in the first place. It was never anything else with gw2 since release. Sure glyphs are new, but it was the same with the switch from character bound to account bound. There are plenty of players out there with six or more copper-feds or multiple gathering tools of the same type. Ultimately you are paying for the skin and implementation at the release date of given item. Glyphs are simply a bonus and can be bought via karma (as tool) or tp (as glyph) a few months after there initial release. The addet bonus effect of some item shop tools are also nothing new. Most of the first gen tools, if you will call them that way, are holding some of the strongest boni ingame. These effects are known for years. Some of the picks are even worse than ori picks because they got not updated with the fourth hit. That is the reality with games under development. Some things will be outdated years later, some things will become stronger.
---
About the old tools without a glyph slot: Simply go to a black lion exchange specialist and you will receive a new shiny tool.
---
And for the freebee glyph. Yes, they were a reward for current active players (exactly like living story episodes). But you can buy every single one as a karma variant tool from a tool-vendor or as a permant glyph from the tp. One of the most expensive glyphs is part of the current black lion chest rotation atm and therefore dropped significantly in price.
---
Physical vs digital good argument. There is probably a flag, 1 or 0, that they flip to have a glyph on and a number 0-x to determine the type. 
---
If you make a better gpu you don't go back and upgrade everyone's because it is a physical product. You can't change one bit and make a gtx 980 into a rtx 2080ti. When they release new drivers, better software, for your gpu they let you update for free though. 
---
If every 6 months they released a new tool set with an additional glyph slot would you feel like you were paying for something they spent time and money improving? When all they did was change a single number from 1 to 2. 
---
The truth is the whole system is a gold sink with little to no value. A player would need to play for years gathering nonstop to recoup any amount of gold/$ spent on filling a glyph slot (unless it was free with the tool). The whole system could be made fun and add depth to gathering if it wasn't implemented as a cash grab.
---
I think it's doing extremely poorly. If gw2china was a success anet would never shut up about it. Meanwhile, they are quiet, which means they have nothing to be proud of.
---
Diviner Renegade is a solid WvW class, but not for roaming.  Its main use is as a perma-Alacrity buffer, and as a backline spamming Hammer 2 on cooldown with an occasional Hammer 5.
---
But Diviner gear makes you do less damage and be super squishy. You'd get stomped in 1v1s.  Even if you go a different gear set, I can't see Renegade as a viable roamer. Kalla stance is awful in PvP, and none of Renegade's utilities are useful in roaming.  If you want to roam as a Rev, I would suggest Herald.
---
Sounds good. I mean worst case I waste an hour getting my ass kicked. 
---
My girlfriend and I are playing and would like to be able to run some dungeons just the two of us so we don't have to wait for LFG. I can play around with classes and specs and see what happens
---
It is very pay-to-win. If you don't pay for the expansions, you'll rarely win (unless you decide Core Warrior is your calling).
---
It is always a good time to be getting into GW2. Find a guild, get some friends. I have a lot of fun solo, and most PUGs are fine. The only thing I'd really recommend a guild for is team roaming in WvWvW and Raids. You don't want to do those with PUGs.
---
yeah im being defensive lol. 
---
You mistake fantasy lore with gw2 lore. Thats my whole point. Gw2 isnt lord of the rings, it isnt wow and it isnt TES. Its gw2, and we clearly know more about gw2 than you. You just stubbornly try to convince yourself that you are in the right. 
---
Thats pathetic. 
---
Its such a weak argument to say that I could be using my time better because you literally do the same thing. You also know nothing of me and breaking your "arguments" took me minutes, I still have lots of time to do more practical stuff. 
---
The "freezing while turning the camera" happens to me too often and I'm running the game maxed out at 60 FPS minus crowded cities and boss events where I dip to sub-40s or even low 20s depending on the situation.
---
I've heard theories that it happens when the game swaps load from one of your CPU cores to another (the game can't really utilize multiple cores well, it's often maxing out just one core). The fact that using the new d912pxy (directx12 wrapper thing for GW2) gets rid of the problem to me supports this claim because it seems to make the CPU workload a bit more venly distributed to me.
---
&gt; without using fb
---
fb ?
---
GW1 getting QoL updates while GW2 still has no build templates. Funny.
---
don't agree with that reasoning. A PvE only player or a WvW only player could easily gear themselves to play any of the other 2 game modes. A PVP player should be able to do the same. PvP players have now access to legendary quality armor, and since there's quite a bunch of pvp armor skins it's a fair compromise, There's also a pvp legendary backpiece but there's no legendary pvp weapons, so it's fair that they are rewarded with an actual weapon. If i'm not mistaken you can only choose from the generation 1 legendaries except eternity so in the end it's the same as if they were rewarded with gold and used that gold to purchase the legendary on TP.
---
Love the look of first two, looks like you paint a world into brighter future xDD
---
Funny thing is that the computer itself didn’t come with a manual or anything else documenting exactly what model it was, so I had to guess, but I’m pretty sure it’s the [Skytech Archangel](https://www.amazon.com/SkyTech-Archangel-Gaming-Computer-Desktop/dp/B01CUZKM3C) or otherwise something very similar. 
---
No quaggan drawings and no Anet praising
---
smd , upvote this
---
&gt; it's that there are so many other things in the game that should reward an achievement of some sort. 
---
Your initial post does not convey this in any way.  
---
&gt; that lets anet get away with shit like
---
So make some valid complaints instead of what you posted here.  
---
FX-6300 is a pretty meh CPU, especially because the game benefits from high single-core performance which that one doesn't have.
---
Yeah I don't really know what they are wanting for the spec since DD is better cleave, vuln, single target and has stolen skills and more passive survivability. I think power DD needs a touch of a nerf, just to bring it below D/D DE for single target, and condi DD needs a considerable buff. 
---
You can't compare 100CM to Siren. Mechanics are the hard part of 100CM. I'm still looking for hard mechanics in Siren.
---
Just like Darwin said: "Adapt !.. And don't show them your butt" 
---
Nice charr~!
---
I'm sorry, what? When did we start having to pay for patches or living world story? I'm not saying those are related to the glyph situation, just that your analogy is terrible.
---
If you think the instabs are too difficult for you that day maybe you need to drop down to t3. 
---
Someone called?
---
You really think tolkien magic is anything like elder scroll magic? You dont even know anything about any of these worlds and you try to use them as an argument for this? Thats absolutely hilarious. 
---
Thats like saying Star wars and Star Trek are the same and that the "sciences" in each apply to the other, thats just not true, they are different franchise made by different people entirely. 
---
Magic in LoTR is scarce and mysterious, have you seen or heard gandalf throw fireballs? And then you speak about the wyvern thing, which I knew you would bring up, it fits your weak argumentation style. The wyvern and dragon thing is the same. If the people at Bethesda decided that their wyvern were called dragons in THEIR universe, then they get to decide that. 
---
Would you argue with the author of 1984 because europe and asia is called Eurasia isntead of their real name? 
---
Go actually read on gw2. You use logics and features from other franchises which have nothing to do with gw2 to justify gw2 stuff, you wont win an argument that way, it certainly wont make you look smart. 
---
At the end of the day I'm fine with the whole thing about newer tools being better, as you said you can buy similar tools for karma and all that. I'm also not complaining about how I missed the free glyph, but previous tools should be updated to reflect that newer, strictly better ones, exist.
---
Either by lowering their cost, or by giving the previous tools a glyph retroactively.
---
Hrm? You rang?
---
I'm confused by this comment, are you saying ANet should not design instabs around how bad players are? I have no desire to join a static, most days t4s are just fine, I'm just reflecting on my experience with how the new instabs tend to affect pugs of varying skill levels.
---
The only instabilities I ever notice as far as gameplay goes are Birds, Slippery Slope and We Bleed Fire. The rest don't change anything about how I play.
---
It varies from class to class. For example I think power holo is still a really solid choice for mathias.
---
-You can easily hit moving targets
---
-Great CC for the sacrifice
---
-Inherent mobility for dropping wells and poisons
---
-Even inherent stability for the rain phase
---
If you don't know exactly what you've got, there's an easy way to find out:
---
Open System Information (you can search it through the Start Menu), and note what's in the System Summary lines for OS Name, Processor, Installed Physical Memory; then in the Components → Display lines for any and all Name / Adapter Description lines.

Oh hey... that's my Cousin, Steve.

i tried with an i5-7600 - 8gb ram ddr4 - r9 380 turbo 4gb and i got funky graphics, had to re install stuff...
---
The way you are phrasing things implies that Anet should be ashamed of the unfair monetization they have applied to the game, but you are ignoring two factors: one, that such monetization is expected, common, and actually looked at as a *feature* in eastern MMOs, where people are proud to spend the most money to unlock more than other people, and two, that most of the monetization of the Chinese GW2 was most likely decided upon and implemented by KongZhon, the distributor of the game in that region. It is a disservice to the fairness of this game's business model to imply that Anet is sneakily implementing predatory or anti-consumer monetization practices when they likely have almost next to nothing to do with the game in China on a day to day basis.
---
i would say it's nothing new. ruby drop rate has always been pretty low. the main source are the daily chests from the metas and dailies as well as the home instance node.
---
&gt; I'm not saying those are related to the glyph situation, just that your analogy is terrible.
---
So you brought up an unrelated analogy to accuse me of a bad analogy?  oooookaaay.
---
And he argued that the digital product nature entitled the user to replacements or upgrades.  If you've ever bought MS Office, Solidworks, or any other software/software as a service you know damn well that you don't just get the upgrade for free.  
---
Nah, they did increase the prices on the website though.
---
Hm, I could just delete and add the contents again to play with or without it, strange.
---
the main reason is your conditions actually keep doing damage until they drop off, so dps is generally running on higher uptime with condi, and additionally, confusion is fucking broken on matthias
---
I'm actually working in Aurora so maybe i can answer you question.
---
1- Drop from harvesting nodes is shit, not low, SHIT. got 1-3 rubbies from harvesting all the map is a common thing for me.
---
2- There is no hearth to get more rubbies as you say, but, Justiciar + Meta event ( VG) will reward you 3 or 5 bloodstone rubbies each.
---
3- If your looking for the best way to get those --&gt; Pvp, Wvw :D
---
Thank you very much! 
---
I stopped mining for rubies cos the drop rates so low, I just get 3 from my home instance node and about 8 from the BLTC contract each day til i have what i need
---
Do dailies and kill bosses, rubies have always been a pain to obtain. If you're in a pinch, do map completion using griffon mount on alts, it takes less than 5min per alt and yields 5 rubies.
---
You didn't include any artwork that isn't your own or wasn't commissioned by you or include a picture of the hero select screen with your recent makeover. Sorry.
---
More seriously, this is absolutely fine topic and could carry some interest so it's a shame that you are getting down votes. Have an up one. 
---
Keep in mind you don't level necessarily the best way by killing mom sits by doing story, Dynamic events, Karma Hearts, Etc. Killing mobs even with Buffs like killstreak or extra XP is very minimal XP reward and this way the game entices you to explore
---
Yes I imagine it is very difficult and time consuming. Anet are a great company, they just take ages to do nearly everything.
---
I head parts of it can be used to brew some beer.
---
My guess: [Feedback](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feedback).
---
Desmina is MORE condi focused than matt due to the insane bonus from Confusion
---
For what your looking for, I think finding a guild is the answer. We all like to pretend the server communities are way different but what you just said about SoS is true of most servers. I think DOC is on your server, sorry you have to deal with that. And yeah, I get stomped by those Xv1 Blackgate groups all the time, I feel your pain. Most WvW guilds are zerging guilds but smaller ones do exist. vT comes to mind on FA (i think?) and such. I have been trying to get out of my anti-social bubble and talking to other roamers lately, its a good way to make some friends or create "i got your back" situations. Good luck! If you see a Revenant on YB with the \[BEND\] tag that is me, sorry if I killed you, and if you killed me it was complete luck I swear ;)
---
I've only used it for 2 days and only played PvE. The game crashed once in Lion's Arch and before I used it I haven't had a single crash during 130+ hours. So, can't say much about stability yet but from what I've heard (and what the github page says) it isn't perfectly stable yet, it's still in alpha after all.
---
I wouldn't probably use it in situations where the game crashing would be a disaster.
---
I think it was about $600. It works great with absolutely everything other than GW2, and even then it’s just this stuttering issue. Since it’s a desktop, does this mean I could eventually install another single, powerful core to work alongside the others, or is that not an option?
---
&gt; directly
---
I mean, literally the way you italicize things emphasizes them for the audience as they read your post, as if they should be just as stunned as you are that *story* is locked behind a paywall in Eastern MMOs.
---
You're the one who asked why you were getting downvoted.
---
I don't think I have a favourite profession specifically for map completion... I usually just play whatever feels the most fun or different for me at the time. I have a few different characters where I don't have 100% Map Completion on right now... I'm not in a rush to get them done so sometimes I'll play my least played profession (to get to know the skills better) or a profession that uses some weapons I still need weapon master on. Sometimes I'll just play one that needs to do a map I haven't gone to in a while, just to break up the monotony. :) 
---
Before mounts made it so fast to travel through the core Tyria maps, I probably would have preferred mesmer or thief due to their mobility. 
---
Spellbreakers can punish a Mirage that overextends, I can bait quite a few of them and then blow through their stunbreaks and stamina bars with a hammer and basically instagib them. 
---
But a careful Mirage that just turtles pretty much can't be killed, they'll just save a blink and peace out even if you burst them. 
---
Nah, it isn't justified. Raids in GW2 aren't difficult enough to force everyone to switch to whatever is brokenly good on that encounter. Mechanics and enrage timer, especially on Matthias, are lenient enough that a reasonably sensible composition will do absolutely fine. 
---
Like EA and Activision, for starters
---
i could spend it on unlock scourge for my human toon... so yes it is saving
---
Wasn't China one of the main reasons why the canthan district of Divinity's Reach had to be removed? 
---
People in this sub don't respond well to criticism of the game.
---
you're absolutely right and it's a great idea
---
You're so wrong at so many levels I can't even begin to prove you wrong. You didn't even make a comparison to begin with. 
---
Thanks for the update! I'm debating giving it a try, though since most of my time has been devoted to WvW as of late, I'm hesitant to use something that might make me a liability to the squad... x3
---
Maybe I'll just setup a second download of the client to use this with, though, just for fun! 
---
Droprate may suck, but I just finished getting all 3 peices. The 200 for the back was brutal, but really, its worth it for the cheap changeable stats.
---
I'll throw in my 2 cents on your questions:
---
1. Mesmer is a great choice, though you will most likely be using different gear sets for Fractals and WvW. Ranger and Warrior are going to also be good choice, and Engi and Thief are runner ups because they are a little more selfish in Fractals but make great roamers. 
---
2. PoF and LW Season 4 have meta events, but only the Istan farm is worthwhile (S4E1). People still farm VB, AB, TD, and DS regularly, just check LFG or jump into the map and see what's going on. 
---
3. No new dungeons, new Fractals though. Dungeons are still being run but it usually takes a while to get a group. Personally, I don't run them anymore, but I occasionally see a few people looking for runs. 
---
4. If you're leveling a new toon, then just try to find the enjoyment. You can jump on a level 80 to make sure you have gliding and the raptor mount unlocked, but they aren't really necessary, just QoL improvements. If you happen to come up with goals along the way (legendary crafting, specific skins, etc.) check out the wiki and see what is time gated. Otherwise just get back into the grove and enjoy yourself.
---
5. Raids are fun, and not as hard as people complain. The LFG boss is the worst, because people want to clear bosses on the first try and not waste time. It makes sense, but it sucks for people who want to try it but have no experience. Groups are more lenient nowadays. I've killed a few raid bosses, but it did take a few tries. Best thing I can say is look for "Training" groups. They will go over the mechanics, and get you familiar with how to do the fight. I've even gotten a few boss kills on training runs because it is easier than you think. Also, watch youtube videos of normal runs (not that solo or 2 man boss kill stuff), that way you know what to expect and aren't going in completely blind. It still is a commitment, but not as bad as it used to be. 
---
This next daily reset I'll be on the 28th day and was wondering which of the rewards from the login reward is better to get. I'm thinking either the 6 tomes or 20 laurels. What's better to pick from the chest?
---
Sometimes I can't log out or click ready up in pvp pop ups or any left mouseclick actions ever since I'm using taco :(
---
same. met my husband online, and got to know him in the chat, we played games and fell in love with each other. it was in 2005 and we were teenagers :D 
---
I can't *even* at this point. Not sure if this is a severe case of *white-knighting* or if you just woke up in a bad mood today. Either way, I'm done dealing you and seeing any more derailing to the main topic at hand. If you have a problem with this post, then feel free to report it to the moderators.
---
I've used the latest release for about 10 hours in WvW without a single crash, so I'd say it's worth a try now.
---
In comparison the original release was crashing every 10-20 minutes. I'm not using any other add-ons.
---
And just to add to that, (and because it's kind of the goal of this post :D ), the only reason to buy a tool that doesn't come with a glyph is if you REALLY don't like the animation.
---
Right now, you can buy a gathering tool that comes with the industry glyph, which currently costs almost as much as the gem cost of the tool in gold.
---
If you're mainly looking for the infinity value and don't particularly care about the skin, you might as well grab that one and get yourself a free griffon.  
---

---
It has some visual bugs and it might make your game crash plus it increases the CPU, RAM and VRAM usage quite a bit. In my case it works, for some others it doesn't. Nothing to lose if you try although it says "at your own risk". It's also still in alpha stage so it's far from finished.
---
Yes, famous companies behind most Eastern MMOs like EA and Activision. 
---
God, I hope you never have to play a game like BDO that actually damages their experience with how prevalent and necessary their microtransactions are.
---
&gt;It's like the spellbreaker elite skill that is a 10 second cooldown.
---
This is actually untrue, Full Counter can be interrupted, and in some cases completely ignored (Necros with their shitty fear completely ignored FC). It's also not a stunbreak. 
---
Personally I can just swap the files in/out of the folder but another person said they needed to reinstall the game after recoming it.
---
"Why do people have problems with my post?"
---
&gt;Reasons
---
"FUCKING WHITE KNIGHTS SHILLING FOR ANET JUST REPORT ME INSTEAD OF TELL ME YOUR PROBLEMS WITH MY POST GOD DAMN"
---
GW Platinum Edition has Prophecies and Eye of the North, but you're probably best off getting the Trilogy and EOTN. That way you get everything.
---
What that doesn't tell you (as far as i can see) is that foraging with Unbound sickle gives you 3 times the reward with a single use (if the node allows it so).
---
Personally i use only unbound and volatile.
---
For me it did cause I hate stuttering. Basically without the proxy the game stutters to me quite a lot, especially when turning the camera quickly. I didn't get higher FPS overall (although some did) but I no longer get any more stutters than in other games when running under 60 FPS. In other words, smoother overall experience with noticeably better frame pacing.
---
Bread? That's kinda funny, and weird. I don't know about exact models like props and armours, but did they change a lot of the skills and condition icons (like Poison). Thief and Necromancer skills that had skulls were replaced by faces(?) and any traces of "red" colouring were replaced by greens and such. I remember a thread that had screenshots that showcased interesting changes. If I come across it, I'll update the thread with those links.
---
I thought I had all HP possible (full map completion for all maps), and I am at ~350. How did you get to 404?
---
That would probably help, especially the character model limit and model quality settings which give big FPS boosts when set to lowest.
---
This thread isn't just about mirage. Yes, instagib Chrono Mesmer with complete engagement control is still broken even after nerfs, what else is new?
---
Using something like this would be really difficult to get accurate population numbers. You'd need to get the majority of players to use the add-on to have enough zone, gamemode, and timezone coverage, and on top of that, many players have multiple accounts.
---
I've been needing bloodstone dust for vision crystals, so I've been hitting Bloodstone Fen pretty hard in the past few weeks, and I have to say... it's no worse than it's been in the past.
---
I'd suggest using (if you aren't already)[ TaCo Markers](https://youtu.be/quKSP6hdqFo) with [tekkit's BF route](https://youtu.be/Jsn339DTO7w). Pretty fast, and you hit every node in the map.
---
That said, each go-round is still only 4 to 6 rubies.
---
and? do you think they wouldn't give us enough HPs in that release?
---
Indeed, NCSoft wasn't particularly fond of the idea. That said, they're currently taking a more hands-off approach than they were at launch, so it's possible we'll get to Cantha eventually.
---
Laurels or Legendary crafting materials are my picks. Going through all of them:
---
* Laurels are one of the most limited currencies in the game. Due to LS3 and LS4 one of their main uses (buying Ascended trinkets) is not as necessary but it is still a very safe choice for when Laurels are needed like with some of the new trinkets that did require Laurels. Because you can buy crafting material bags they give the most gold as well (14g right now).
---
* Legendary crafting materials are the best choice if you're planning on making a Legendary. If you aren't purchasing Mystic Clovers from the Fractal Vendor then they cost ~4.5g per Clover for a total of 31.5g. Because Clovers are account bound and only used in crafting legendaries that gold value is only realized if you'll be making them though.
---
* Ascended crafting materials have too much RNG for me. You are getting somewhere between 4.2g (single silk) and 13.2g (two leather). You can get the laurels, convert it into money T4 material bags, and buy the materials to craft the ascended stuff for cheaper.
---
* Unless you're planning on leveling a ton of alts I'd skip tomes as well. That's either 6 levels or 6 spirit shards, both of which you can get from just playing the game.
---
wow that is great  
---
wonder if they could update the questlog to show on which maps I still have npcs waiting for me to run new adventures  
---
The box itself is worth more in terms of prestige than any legendary weapon.
---
I would suggest picking the 20 laurels as tomes are much easier to acquire.
---
How come the original Guild Wars didn't face any backlash? Or if it did, I didn't hear about it. 
---
Conditions can still be applied during and tick during shield phases
---
Siren is of course easier than 100CM, my point is that siren's with **this** instability makes it harder than 100CM by far, not due to mechanics being more difficult but just due to the lack of foresight of how strong the outflanked instability is in that fight.
---
I don't think you have understood my argument.
---
Off the top of my head CoE, CoF, and Arah all have at least one path where the team is split and require a full team to stand in specific spots while the 5th does something.
---
I know I've seen videos on youtube of players speed run solo/duo through dungeons.
---
Any tips on getting d912pxy to work? I downloaded it and followed the Readme instructions for installation, and had 0 difference on performance (quite literally the exact same FPS with it and without).
---
For reference, I have an i7 8700k, GTX 1080, 16 GB RAM - and am confident I meet the requirements for it.
---
I have played some of them.  But they're too far gone to bother fighting.  EA and Activision at least can still be redeemed
---
acutally, the initial rewards for pvp and wvw are great to get exotic gear up. classy pvp is not my cup of rum, with my warrior thats a shitshow only against all the stealth-range-poke-nuke - classes around.
---
This question isn't meant to be offensive, so I apologize if it comes off as such.
---
Do you and your raid group participate at a "high level" of raiding, not quite "hardcore" but at least where-in you attempt for speedkills, leaderboard rankings, et cetera? I'm just curious if people use two healers for that level of play, or if two healers are more used for "prog" and "clears" rather than speedkills, et cetera.
---
really is tbh
---
Well if you check the threads themselves on the official forum, all of them are about condi mirage.
---
By instagib chrono mesmer you mean the power shatter build? Because that is a non-existent proper spvp, it's just a meme build for trolling. Essentially zero players in top250.
---
The bunker chrono on the other hand, is ridiculously strong in good hands.
---
Na nana na na na naaa Choyabusters!
---
I'm pretty sure the reason they don't make them anymore is becuase the dev who written the code for dungeons left, and no one else can understand it
---
The hard part about PvP balance is that you need to look at it from the outside without class bias.
---
It is nice being powerful, but is it healthy for the game for Mirage to he so powerful?
---
I say this believing that Mirage, and mesmer in general, is overpowered by how they are designed from the bottom up.  Mesmer could do 50% less damage than every other class and would still get used for the other tools it brings.
---
This is where things get tricky. Outside of removing portal, clones, teleports, massive boon uptime, and some of the best CC in the game there is always going to be an issue. 
---
 Anet has tried tackling these issues but the fact that after so many nerfs Mesmer is still on top of every game mods speaks to the larger issue. Damage-wise Mirage is not OK, not even giant confusion bombs.
---
**But how do you balance a class that is so anti-fun to play against people just stop playing PvP.**
---
Frames dropping when you turn the camera with your mouse is a known issue involving [polling rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4z0en8/weird_fps_drops_when_moving_the_mouse_in_gw2/).

Also, [this is the best thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8gctrf/full_guide_maximizing_your_fps_and_game/) I've found for improving performance, including tips in the comments.  I would test each item out individually to see how it impacts performance.
---
We don't have the slightest clue about an expansion atm. However, we have clues about a LS5 right after LS4 (and before EXP3), and about anet wanting to release "expansion worth" stuff with LS.
---
So imho we can still hope for more expansions, but I would really not bet on 2019. More likely 2020.
---
You should have just had to remove the dll. You should submit a bug report if it broke the whole game, as it makes no changes to game data.

&gt;I've only used it for 2 days and only played PvE. The game crashed once in Lion's Arch and before I used it I haven't had a single crash during 130+ hours.
---
Your planet has 65 hour days, huh? Can I move there?
---
I can agree that I didn’t have any trouble getting my repairs covered under warranty but with a premium brand and a machine that costs as much as these do the issues shouldn’t be as common as the are.
---
I hope not just poison... Or at least they'll add a few different types of poison... While poison is nice, is not the greatest condition and it doesn't even scale in intensity if I remember right. I hope I am not wrong by expecting more than that...
---
How does that work? If it has something to do with pagefile I don't have that on the same hard drive than the game is located.
---
all of them ^^
---
Garbage. 
---
If it did, I haven't heard about it, and ANet was certainly owned by NCSoft at the time. Perhaps the stance of upper management on the topic changed over the intervening years, or they just didn't expect GW1 to be as successful as it was.
---
that thinking is quite wrong, bc nobody who plays just pve can have a chance against the sneaky stuff of pvp, it would also need you to know all classes. i'm quite new and play for 2 months \~ and i still have zero clue what they overall can do, outside of the obvious stuff. mesmer, ranger and the other dps cannons are unbeatable for non-pvp-veterans, to a level where its more of a joke than anything else.
---
Personally, I'd love a spec that sacrifices shroud for enhanced movement/damage that turns Necro into a kind of Necromatic thief or Mesmer and enhances Necro's single target damage capabilities. Poison could certainly fit into that aspect as well but as you said, a minion focused spec with poison is likely to appear at some point.
---
I checked on the baidu page for it a year or two ago and I recall something about it doing poorly.
---
One comment said it was because the Chinese audience is use to a grindy game where it forces you to play on its terms, so GW2's "play as you like" confused people because they didn't know what to do.
---
You're probably missing LS2 maps, WvW, krait shard. But that's not enough to explain such a difference, are you sure you have all other maps done ? Core, HoT, PoF ?
---
Oh, never heard of polling rate. I have an old Logitech MX518, will look further into this, thanks.
---
Last night we went harrier rev, minstrel fb (i swapped my harrier so i can run wvw), dh weaver and bs.
---
Reflect and ggez sirens reef.
---
For dulfy we just put our backs against the gate!
---
to often people forget that outflanked has another effect on it. 25% less damage when facing your enemy, also the 300% dmg from behind is only for foes within 300 range of you which is barely outside of melee range. 
---
For sireens reef unless your team has great dps and lots of reflects just kill the adds as they come up the boat(those things are helpful regardless). Yes its a drag to not be able to blitz down the boss ezpz. However less adds or no adds to worry about make outflanked a joke of a instability to deal with.
---
I did notice the other day I mined 7 nodes with no ruby drop.
---
[Hahahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1wXjuPXPBQ)
---
Dang, was hoping that would fix it for you.  [SSDs are cheaper now, you could probably test that theory for $20?](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2FDzK8/kingston-a400-120gb-25-solid-state-drive-sa400s37120g)
---
This makes pugging largos my personal nightmare. I always have to state in my LFG that 'I'm running dpsmeter and I'll be *watching you'.* Still many people with bad dps and can't handle dodging mechanics.
---
I do have a 220GB SSD but it's filled with my music stuff which *needs* an SSD to load quickly.
---
There are a couple of devs that tend to gw1 in their free time. Not all heroes wear capes.
---
if pugs are to stubborn to kill the adds (they dont respawn unless the fight resets) then those pugs are deliberately making the encounter harder. Thats on them. Its like trying to burst down the subject 6 in thermanova, if your grp does not have the dps you are going to have to kill more shit to get it done, ie the adds when the spawn every 25%.
---
That was a popular rumor for a while, but I believe ANet said that wasn't actually the case. I'm not well-informed enough on that front to give details, but I don't think there's really an issue with making Cantha.
---
Ah damn, im playing on EU :D Sorry
---
I also have many great memories playing Fort Aspenwood killing the Luxon turtles. :D

Kurzick for life!

I met my x wife in wow ages ago. Turns out we where just bad for one another we both got a gift out of it and wouldn't trade it for the world. We are becoming friends atleast and we never do anything out of spite and aare fair to one another. However I met my fiance on Facebook in a spiritual group surprisinly we are amazing together and currently living together. My. Honest advice is the only way to truly tell is if both people are honest with each other transperency is key in all relationships from both sides. No secrets even your thoughts. If you are committed then there is nothing to hide. Otherwise don't waste your time. 
---
Free griffon? 
---
Sure, you can beat Matthias with 10 heal eles but I don't want to be in a 2 hour raid boss fight.  Also, it's not a matter of playing broken classes or not enraging etc.  It's a matter of laziness.  If every DPS is doing 15k and you are doing 5k, you are not pulling your weight and are effectively leeching.  Your lower DPS means the fight lasts longer and therefore more mechanics to deal with and things that could go wrong.
---
I am all for "play whatever you want" but you have to actually play it WELL.  Don't play Longbow only base ranger and do 3k DPS.  DO play Longbow only base ranger and do 20k DPS on Gorseval (if that's even possible).  If I see a DH on Matt, I give them a chance.  If they are doing very low DPS then I ask them to relog to something else.  If they don't, kick.  Leeching raids is bad, don't do it.
---
&gt; it doesn't even scale in intensity
---
It does though
---
Make mesmer.
---
As a wukong main: No.
---
Power damage gets reduced by 90% on the sacrificed person. Condition damage doesn't.
---
You can very reliably get 3 rubies from your home instance node, I'd usually get maybe 2-3 doing random nodes around the giant crater/hole in bloodstone fen after that. Though i usually do it for the magic gathering/gliding combat daily chests. 
---
Am I the only one who actually doesn't want a Cantha expansion?
---
I liked Cantha as much as the next guy, but I don't want ANet to release two nostalgia-driven expansions in a row. Seeing Elona was cool, but if the plot makes a hard left turn into Cantha, I'd be considering them almost creatively bankrupt.
---
I had to do a google only to find out its that book series I've been putting off for so long. If only I had read it sooner, I wouldn't have had to google it.

I was playing GW1 a week ago and it bothered me that I couldn't flag my heroes (4-7). My prayers have been answered!
---
You lose! Good DAY sir!
---
Probably 2 to 3 more months after ep. 6.  They did it that way between s3 and PoF.
---
What a eloquent argument, I am convinced you are right now!

Lol... Come on mate, dont embarass yourself further. 
---
Sorry for the delayed response. As most of you can imagine it has been a trying week for us....

For anyone who is interested in joining us, we will be gathering at Fort Marriner in Lion's Arch at Reset on Saturday February 9th. The plan is to then walk from there to AC where we will be observing a moment of silence. And then running some Dungeons in honor of him.

&gt; How can anyone be this dumb?
---
I'm wondering the same about you after reading through your comments.
---
Are you okay? Im starting to think you have actual issues you should be addressing instead of crying to me because you arent smart enough to admit being wrong or to understand what someone else is saying.

Thank you for your story Allie. &lt;3
---
&gt;Hotkeys for #4-7 heroes
---
Like. Wow... Absolute gamechanger that one. Would have made my life waaaaaay easier when clearing some stuff solo.
---
Thank you very much for your support Thaddeus.
---
Diviner stats aren't good on Herald for roaming either.  It'll significantly reduce your damage and you won't get any real value from the boon duration from the Diviner set.  Either go Berserker for a glassy build, or some more defensive set.
---
Do dungeons- Get exotic armor/weapons and suitable runes.
---
Do wvw/pvp reward tracks(triumphant/legacy/hero) - stat selectable armor/weapons.
---
I would suggest you to try wvw and pvp also. If you feel like you love the game then only buy an expansion. Btw if you decide to buy then buy from dlgamer website as it usually always has gw2 on sale and is an official retailer.
---
The one that made things crazy for me was Deepstone with Fire Breath and outflanked during the deldrimor light puzzle room the enemies kept spawning like crazy and we couldn’t advance and we wiped like 10 times. It became a race to get to the spheres ASAP 
---
&gt; you are pretty dense. 
---
The irony of this coming from someone who thinks spellbreaker is useful is way too much.
---
&gt;go and play t4 cms/fractals in meta speedrun groups as warrior for a while and you will see what they want from a warrior and when.
---
What they want from a warrior is to play with only 2 traitlines?
---
&gt;point still stands, it is useful in pve in certain scenarios and nobody said it has to be useful everywhere to 100%. doesn't make it less favorable. to not having to drop a burst dps for a boonrip when needed with a miniscule dps loss is a big plus and you can't argue against that.
---
when bossphases are just so long that you can just break and get f1 + whirl out and then its dead / phased it really doesn't matter anyway if you where a normal warrior or a spellbreaker...except for when no pain no gain is up, then it matters big time. who would have tought.
---
Except no pain no gain is 1 fractal instability out of 19 which is what you can't argue against.
---
&gt;Which PvE mobs rarely if ever apply in the first place.
---
What? PvE mobs spam conditions these days, it's straight up torture trying to run around without a consistent form of condi cleanse.
---
Again, you seem to inhabit a completely different reality from me. Condi cleanse is important in over world PvE because of how often you end up crippled for 20 seconds while trying to get from A to B, or you need to solo an event full of awakened who each apply at least three stacks of torment and bleed every few seconds.
---
&gt;You keep calling a block, but it's not a block, it's an aegis that only lasts 1.5 seconds. There's a massive difference between that an a real block.
---
The fact that it only blocks for 1.5 seconds and that it only blocks a single hit isn't really an issue in PvE, where mobs have pretty easy telegraphs. Are you honestly saying there's *zero* value in having access to an aegis block on an 8 second cooldown? If you're good, that's almost complete immunity to any mob's main physical damage move or knockback.
---
&gt;He has 1 source of self healing, the alternative dagger. The other source relies on something stock warrior already has and can already do, in exchange for litterally giving up an entire trait tree.
---
You keep saying "literally giving up an entire trait tree" but what are you even talking about? Even at a base level Spellbreaker isn't that bad. Pure Strike and Magebane Tether are solid traits that stand on their own in PvE so at the bare minimum they have that. The Master tier is a little barren unless you like daggers, but Dispelling Force is a good minor because it allows the warrior to have *some* boonstrip without having to actually spec into any of the boonstrip traits or skills. Attacker's Insight is also a perfectly good minor because it effectively lets you have Full Counter up on demand.
---
So out of the entire Spellbreaker spec, you're doomed to have maybe one underwhelming trait, unless you're saying a 14% crit damage boost that by your own admission is always up because enemies never have boons is worthless.
---
Moving on to Spellbreaker's skills, the statement gets even more confusing. Natural Healing, Featherfoot Grace, Imminent Threat and Winds of Disenchantment are perfectly good skills in PvE. We've already established why Natural Healing is good, but the resistance and superspeed on Featherfoot is appreciated in overworld gameplay, and if you combine it with the resistance from Healing Signet then Spellbreaker becomes uniquely condi-resistant. Imminent Threat isn't the greatest, but it's pretty good AoE CC and useful for setting up some Full Counter bombs if that's your thing. Winds of Disenchantment makes a giant projectile-free zone for a decent amount of time, so it sees plenty of situational use for skill challenges and events.
---
Alright, so let me sum this up:
---
&gt;90% of his kit is about boonstrip and 1v1 duels, which has no use in PvE.
---
And yet you can build a Spellbreaker to have only a single source of boonstrip, from a single minor trait that doesn't even force you to run anything you aren't already using to use it.
---
Also, what are you talking about, duels aren't relevant to PvE? Have you never tried to solo a champ or a bounty or an event chain or something? At least half your time is spent fighting 1v1 against a single boss, and ironically Spellbreaker's kit works pretty well since making smart use of Full Counter is a lot easier against the AI than it is against a player.
---
&gt;The majority of his traits do less than nothing
---
Which is fine, as long as there's at least one decent option in each tier. Adept and Grandmaster are covered, Master's a little underwhelming admittedly, but your minors are pretty good too. Out of all that, only one minor is boonstrip related and the only 1v1-focused trait is Magebane, but that still provides it's benefits even if used outside of 1v1 so that's irrelevant.
---
In order to claim that any of this stuff is *literally worthless* you're going to have to explain why specifically.
---
&gt;and his weapons lack cleave.
---
If we're comparing to base Warrior, that doesn't matter since Spellbreaker can just use those weapons that do cleave. They don't even have to use the Spellbreaker skills if they're too situational, just take some Shouts or Banners or Peak Performance. They literally lose nothing over Warrior for this.
---
&gt;Mobs don't behave like players, don't use boons and never 1v1 you. So, a class based in it's absolute entirety around those things has no use because there is nothing to apply those things on.
---
Again, the only true statement in this sentence is that mobs don't behave like players. They *do* use boons, they *do* 1v1 you, Spellbreaker isn't based around either of those things *in it's entirety*, and if you choose to use them anyway then you'll find plenty of applications.
---
It really just seems like you've never actually tried to *use* Spellbreaker in PvE. You just skimmed over it's skills, heard it was a PvP spec from someone on reddit and decided that meant it was literally all about boonstrip and dueling, just like how Dragonhunter was all about using a longbow, fighting from range and using snares and pulls to lure enemies into your traps and was in no way viable if you tried to deviate from that playstyle.
---
Speaking of legendary weapons and Balthazar. I think it's pretty weak shit that his greatsword was not only pretty generic, it was also part of a BL skin set. It was the perfect opportunity to create a *really* legendary weapon with some roots in the story, and later letting the players craft it.
---
:)
---
I wouldn't consider this "free." You have to be one of the 20 people in the world (including China) to win the Tournament of Legends.
---
I've gave up farming bloodstone fen and just did the pvp track a few times to farm rubies for aurora..... way easier
---
Your right they didn't say it that means it will still be every 2-3 months unless Anet comes out and says they are changing the release schedule for the living world that means the same schedule is still in place.
---
I didn't like the Cantha expansion. 
---
The story was fine, but I hated the gameplay. 
---
There is another hairstyle that's more Saiyan. The drawn hair style makes me think of furry costumes.
---
Even more proof that it's their Golden child is that Kenut and Nikare is basically a mesmer only fight. Mirages do ~35% more damage than the 2nd highest dps class (26.4k dps for mirage vs 19.5k for holosmith)
---
Thief too good at kiting qadim. Nerfed self-sustain on thief 3 days later just because of one boss fight. Mirages completely sidelining all other dps roles for one boss fight. \*crickets\* 
---
I have 12 GB RAM (1 stick of the 16 GB died) and a lowly GTX 650  1GB and it is working  fine. It is also very stable, no a single crash yet.
---
I undercut. 14.99 sells way faster than 15.
---
I'm just hoping for cantha because it's likely to involve tengus and I still hope to play them someday.
---
Despite, you know, this making no sense. And despite the fact that both previous expansions had periods of content droughts before their release. Who knows, it might even be a new game( and judging from some open positions about a mobile game a bit ago it might be the case).
---
I highly recommend ASUS RoG. My husband and I have ones that are 4 years old and still going strong. Only problem we had was my husbands power regulator went after 3 years but was covered under our warranty and was quick and painless. He is also harsh on hardware so I kinda blame him lol
---
The schedule is established within a season, not between. Anyway, no point arguing as anet is not going to consult any of us what we think. Shrug.
---
&gt; What? PvE mobs spam conditions these days, it's straight up torture trying to run around without a consistent form of condi cleanse.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Again, you seem to inhabit a completely different reality from me. Condi cleanse is important in over world PvE because of how often you end up crippled for 20 seconds while trying to get from A to B, or you need to solo an event full of awakened who each apply at least three stacks of torment and bleed every few seconds.
---
They don't spam conditions they barely use them. The only mobs who "spam" conditions are certain types of awoken and they aren't even that common.
---
&gt;The fact that it only blocks for 1.5 seconds and that it only blocks a single hit isn't really an issue in PvE, where mobs have pretty easy telegraphs. Are you honestly saying there's zero value in having access to an aegis block on an 8 second cooldown? If you're good, that's almost complete immunity to any mob's main physical damage move or knockback.
---
No, I'm saying there's less than zero value, because it also stops you from attacking.
---
Congratulations, you block a single random mob's auto attack at the expense of being unable to attack yourself. Real helpful.
---
Mobs aren't players. An incredibly tiny ammount of them "main physical damage" moves and even if they did, it's never a 1v1.
---
&gt;You keep saying "literally giving up an entire trait tree" but what are you even talking about?
---
Spellbreaker's tree is garbage for PvE?
---
&gt; Even at a base level Spellbreaker isn't that bad. Pure Strike and Magebane Tether are solid traits that stand on their own in PvE so at the bare minimum they have that.
---
Pure strike is decent as far as "more damage" skills go. 
---
Magebane tether is ok might generation, except it's a grandmaster skill. 
---
Stock warrior can generate more might without it taking up the grandmaster slot.
---
&gt;The Master tier is a little barren unless you like daggers, but Dispelling Force is a good minor because it allows the warrior to have some boonstrip without having to actually spec into any of the boonstrip traits or skills. 
---
What use is boonstrip in PvE?
---
&gt;Attacker's Insight is also a perfectly good minor because it effectively lets you have Full Counter up on demand.
---
Except full counter is useless in PvE and spellbreaker is limited to level 1 bursts, so that's moot in the first place.
---
&gt;Also, what are you talking about, duels aren't relevant to PvE? Have you never tried to solo a champ or a bounty or an event chain or something? At least half your time is spent fighting 1v1 against a single boss, and ironically Spellbreaker's kit works pretty well since making smart use of Full Counter is a lot easier against the AI than it is against a player.
---
Because champs or bounties, unlike regular players, will not be using conditions, will not be using boons, and they won't be trying to move around a lot. 
---
"Duels" involves condi curring and boonstripping, and restricting movement, mobs don't care about any of these.
---
&gt;Which is fine, as long as there's at least one decent option in each tier. Adept and Grandmaster are covered, Master's a little underwhelming admittedly, but your minors are pretty good too. Out of all that, only one minor is boonstrip related and the only 1v1-focused trait is Magebane, but that still provides it's benefits even if used outside of 1v1 so that's irrelevant.
---
Adept is covered by giving you a half decent damage boost.
---
Grandmaster isn't. None of it's skills are particularily useful. The best thing it offers for PvE is some mediocre might generation that stock warrior already had covered in the first place.
---
The skills need to actually be good instead of just being applicable.
---
&gt;In order to claim that any of this stuff is literally worthless you're going to have to explain why specifically.
---
Okay, sure. What specifically do you want me to explain why it's useless? Want me to give you a rundown on every single weapon skill, ability and trait of spellbreaker? I can do that if you want.
---
&gt;If we're comparing to base Warrior, that doesn't matter since Spellbreaker can just use those weapons that do cleave. They don't even have to use the Spellbreaker skills if they're too situational, just take some Shouts or Banners or Peak Performance. They literally lose nothing over Warrior for this.
---
They are losing their third traitline by denying themselves a better one.
---
Any PvE spellbreaker build can be immediately improved by swapping out the spellbreaker tree for a real one.
---
&gt;Again, the only true statement in this sentence is that mobs don't behave like players. 
---
Yes, that's the whole point.
---
&gt;They do use boons, 
---
lol, are you serious right now? Because if you're just going to lie then this discussion doesen't have a meaning.
---
&gt;they do 1v1 you, 
---
No they don't. Mobs are almost always in groups.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker isn't based around either of those things in it's entirety, 
---
He litterally is. 
---
That's the whole point of him. The whole class was built from the ground up to 1v1 boonstrip in pvp.
---
&gt;and if you choose to use them anyway then you'll find plenty of applications.
---
Can you name a few?
---
And by a few, I mean a few that stock warrior can't already do better.
---
&gt;It really just seems like you've never actually tried to use Spellbreaker in PvE. You just skimmed over it's skills, heard it was a PvP spec from someone on reddit and decided that meant it was literally all about boonstrip and dueling, 
---
It really just seems like you invested a ton of gold for spellbreaker cosmetics, and now everytime someone brings up the truth about how worthelss it is you feel the need to defend it in order to covince yourself you didn't throw your money away, kind of like a twisted version of the sunk cost fallacy.
---
Just cut your losses already.
---
&gt;just like how Dragonhunter was all about using a longbow, fighting from range and using snares and pulls to lure enemies into your traps and was in no way viable if you tried to deviate from that playstyle.
---
...except dragonhunter can actually do shit in PvE because his abilities aren't worthless in it. 
---
Has good cleave, decent aoe damage and traits that function well VS mobs, and isn't reliant on his enemy behaving a specific way. 
---
His abilities and weapon are counter-synergetic which is the issue people took with him, but on their own merits they are still actually applicable in pve.
---
Really because when Z took over he didn't say anything about the release schedule for season 4. He never said it would still be 2-3 months and he didn't say it would go to 3-4 months.
---
I have had my Alienware 17 for about 6 months,  so far so good.    It has the best cooling of any of the gaming laptops i have had in the past
---
The Star Trek Online crossover we've all been waiting for!
---
that game looks fantastic.
---
&gt; Why?
---
because that's been anet's pattern of rewarding high cost/grind achievements: with one singular achievement point
---
&gt; How is that a fair reward for making the entire collection considering the time required for that?
---
it's not, which is the entire point
---
&gt;  What is wrong with the current level of rewards? 
---
you literally just said it wouldn't be fair to reward only 1 AP for doing all that, and then at the end you say "I don't see anything wrong with the current reward system" lol ok??
---
&gt; There are multiple ways to interpret your words, and you do not provide reasons why the AP reward should be limited to 1 AP.
---
i think you're having great difficulty interpreting the tongue-in-cheek nature of my posts
---
He was literally in tears and reflecting at the failure he's always thought of himself as.  He's not going to have a stern face at that moment.  I don't think any of this contradicts the Rytlock presented in the past.  It exactly matches with how he behaves in the prequel novels too.  I know you're talking about more than the expression, but Rytlock is completely unguarded in this scene.
---
just FYI, the glyphs that come with the tools are account bound
---
As a general rule, most posts on this sub start with downvotes. Not sure why, I think there's bots or something.
---
It was pretty much the same gameplay and combat system, but with new skills, same types of missions, very little in terms of a conceptual break from prophecies if at all, so I don't really understand this line of thinking.
---
A mobile game? Please tell me that's not true.
---
How i hope Ashes of Creation comes soon and in a great state.
---
Reaper works for power, but it still has some stigma for being tanky because of PvP. As a result, it isnt really a meta worthy power DPS spec. They took a good approach with scourge by removing shroud. It didnt make necros any less tanky in PvE--where stuff one shots you regardless of shroud--but it did remove the idea that "a second lifebar" exists, and that lead to actually being able to have a spec that puts out decent values.
---
I would personally think the next spec is either a high power dps spec with almost no defensive shroud abilities or a very high support type spec--as heal scourge has actually become fairly popular...though it is actually a terrible support for groups that can function--it cant provide boons or group modifiers, its sole strength is that it is better than anything else at wipe recovery/prevention...which skilled groups dont need.
---
and actually crafting the expensive/time-gated asc weapons should also reward AP.  i'm sorry this simple concept is too difficult for you to grasp
---
also lol @ thinking reddit internet points is a reliable measure of anything remotely meaningful 
---
The thing is that it would have to be a big release, way bigger than ls episodes normally are. First of all they have to release all new elite specs in the same patch, otherwise a huge part of the player base would feel left behind. And second, what Dymond mentioned, one map isnt big enough to have enough HPs to unlock a new elite spec. So they would have to release at least three maps as well, so it doesnt feel like you have a HP every five meters.
---
Those two points as well as the fact that putting them behind a paywall like an expansion is an easy and accepted method makes it highly unlikely at best that we will actually see elite specs released independent of an expansion.
---
problem is that almost only synths have that property, so in the vast majority of cases you waste 2/3 of your time. the quick sickles offer a lot more value for those cases, since they not only save you a lot of time during the harvesting process itself, but in most cases also allow you to mount up and run off before you get dragged into combat.
---
There are no semantics here. It does not act like a reflect. Reflect reflects. Absorb is not aegis, Aegis blocks. So it is literally like neither of those things. 
---
Also what is up with the "well everybody still runs it" argument? You don't slot full counter, it's a burst skill. It gets added by speccing into SpB.
---
The minor reasons people run SpB is its synergy with skills such as Rampage and better sustain, but in reality there are simply no other viable Warrior specs. Core warrior is awful, Condi berserker is terrible, and gunflame is a meme. There is literally nothing else to run. 
---
And *again*, because you have no idea how it works, the *most important* part of FC is it refreshing your other Burst Skill. That means that you can use Arc Slice -&gt; FC -&gt; Arc Slice under pressure for massive burst. That's what makes FC really good and dangerous, not its previous damage, which was always minor. This part never changed, it was only affected by cooldown changes.
---
Seriously, it's not hard to try it for yourself so you don't sound ignorant.
---
It scales in intensity. And while its modifier is weak, most every class that is given a specific condition (like torment for scourge or confusion for mesmer) usually has a trait that increases the damage of the specific condition to be in line with bleed--which is more or less the baseline condition damage. The side effect is kind of "meh" in PvE, however, torment and confusion rarely rely on their side effects and have been perfectly fine for condi  specs that use them.
---
wot
---
While every elite spec requires exactly 250 HPs to unlock, not every core class requires the exact same number of HPs.  What class are you?  Though.... Relevant...  
---

---
I honestly just think that even they don't genuinely know what direction the game is headed most of the time.
---
Matthias only has one phase and the down time on attacking isn't that bad. When he bubbles, power classes do no damage while condi classes can continue to stack condis on him. They won't do any damage while the bubble is up but can be applied to him so the condi stacks are already ramped up.
---
There was a post here for a single position for "our mobile game" on the description. 
---
I think mostly people buy on the gemstore for aesthetics, the main functionality of the tools is the endless uses. The glyphs that provide extra mats don't really provide much that much bonus. Industry, unbound and volatility have the best bonuses. While I agree they should be priced differently, I don't think the presence of an added glyph affects sales too much. Personally I'm much more likely to buy a set than individual skins. What bothers me most is how some skins gather more in one animation, like unbound harvesting tool used one guild nodes. I think all unlimited tool gather rates should be as good as the unbound tools, giving people more reason to buy the skins. 
---
Of course you deleted your original posts so I am gonna reply to this one.
---
Please stop whining, you probably play this game more than I do at this point since I rarely log on nowadays, but yet I manged to get a legendary weapon pretty early on (its called saving your gold and not spending it on stupid shit), a legendary backpiece and a full legendary set of armor (non raid).  You're just making excuses at this point.
---
My guess is that they coded them from scratch rather than re-coding them.
---
I believe scourge is a support spec per ANet, so full condi is still open.
---
I think part of the reason for the epi nerf was to open the door for a high single target condi dps elite.  
---
Also, please no new minion master, one set of minions is enough for any class.
---
This is what I wish the raid boss trophies were. I want a whole line of monster heads in my house. :(
---
The fact that he (as well as myself) didn't understand that what you said was supposed to be "very clearly sarcasm" proves that it was _not_ well-implied.
---
Orders necro from GW1 would be neat.
---
That's one of the big fallacies in GW2.
---
If I hit something with a power skill that does 5000 damage up front and then leave to do a mechanic, I did 5000 damage.
---
If I hit something with a condi skill that does 500 damage up front and then 4500 damage over the next 10 seconds while I leave to do a mechanic, I still did 5000 damage.
---
The damage loss on the power class is immediately obvious because they spend time doing 0 damage. However, the damage loss on the condi class is still there since they do *reduced* damage after returning from the mechanic since they weren't stacking condis while they were away. The overall damage output is actually unchanged; the damage just comes in at different times.
---
Sorry, got to crowded on the head. See it as a super crown "upgrade" :D Next time with crown\^\^
---
Take my upvote !
---
They are still playing
---
Yes, but Mirage can do very little at range, especially with builds that shatter. It's still among the best and *the* most reliable dps build there. Range isn't an issue, movement is. See Deimos - there are plenty of power builds that are good for ranging him, but they generally suck on Matthias.
---
Someone nearby has a land shark gun... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfaAdPxudJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfaAdPxudJg)
---
Except that there already is a minion master trait line and a set of minion producing skills. I find it highly unlikely that they'll introduce a minion master based spec unless they do something drastic like make it focused on having a single powerful minion that functions like a ranger pet.
---
I don't want a cantha expansion either you aren't alone. kinda tired of revisiting old places, I'd much rather go to completely new places! after all that's what a sequel is for right?

The only gameplay change I remember from Factions that I actually did not like was how every mission bonus aside from 2 missions were time based and not additional objective based.  The times weren't the problem, it was just not creative and kind of boring.  Apparently, enough people did not like it because they brought back additional objective bonuses in the Nightfall missions.  Aside from that, there is nothing else I can think of that was different gameplay wise from Prophecies.
---
Because why not?
---
If it can become very stable, I'd say it would be very huge from a gameplay perspective.
---
I've had a few times where I set my player rendering to anything above the lowest setting and it was glorious. It's like a whole new experience, ACTUALLY being able to see the people around you. Of course that would last a max of 45 minutes before the framerate became intolerable and I've had to slump back down to the lowest settings again.
---
DX12 can address this by utilizing resources better.
---
Furthermore, Intel does not release new CPUs fast enough to keep up with the rate that ANet is destroying the performance of this game with more detailed expansions and new particle effects.
---
Only if their Social Credit score is high enough. 
---
i never had issue with this instability
---
Dope, thanks!
---
Thanks! :D
---
It's not worth it if you only want the skins. If you're going for the lore and gameplay you'll probably have a good time (after spending a good half an hour trying to move whilst casting and trying to jump) 
---
Shadows, Reflections and player model settings have the largest impact on framerate if maxed out, put those to medium or lower. The rest you can probably leave at least at medium.
---
of course the reasonable advice gets downvoted to hell, welcome to gw2 reddit
---
I swear every time I want to do Siren's Reef T4, it has the worst instabilities attached to it. I think it was We Bleed Fire, Outflanked and Boon Overload today.

This is only for European customers. For US customers some of the prices are actually discounted, and the rest remained the same price. Another reddit user speculated  it could have something to do with the current value of the Euro vs the current value of the US dollar in 2019. I don't know anything about economics though so I have no idea if this is accurate.
---
It doesnt need a lemon
---
alcoholism is worth it.
---
This is ridiculous. They first increase the price point of the games separately as well as all microtransactions and then release the complete collection for 10 bucks more than what it used to be. 
---
Don’t get me wrong it is a great game but in 2019 40 bucks for a game that has little players left is a bit too much. 
---
This one I do by stealthing behind the guy to the far right, then walking behind the huts to do 3, then re-running. Slow, but easy.

This seems like the sort of thing where ANet will be gauging the sales response in order to determine if some sort of commitment to GW1 on an official level is worthwhile.

Views don't automatically translate to liking something or it having a positive effect. Even people who hated it presumably watched it first, after all. And sometimes videos become infamous rather than famous. Look how many people are just now wanting to watch it for the meme/cringe-factor in this very thread, for example.
---
I'm sure some folks really like it, though! Just be careful of making false equivalences.
---
Sounds like !!Fun!!
---
Just to reiterate a little more on what people have said below.
---
The FX-6300 is a 6 core processor that is clocked (out of the box) at 3.5Ghz. The short description of this aspect is, more cores means operations can be split per core, and clock speed is how fast the core can process the operation (bare in mind that this is a VERY simplified explanation that doesn't take models / purpose into account / architecture etc etc)
---
From a graphical standpoint, your GPU (which handles rendering models / textures etc) is a 750Ti, which is a pretty mid tier card from a few generations ago. I wouldn't run GW2 on anything higher than med at 1080p resolution on a card like that)
---
Back to the CPU and Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2, like most (if not all) Directx9 titles, is heavily reliant on a high clock speed as it utilizes one core for 90% of the workload and the rest sort of just come along for the ride at about 5%-15%. from personal experience, I've upgraded differing parts of my PC at different times, and the biggest performance bonus I've ever gained on GW2 has generally been CPU bound. The biggest things to take the strain off your CPU are going to be Player model limit. I have mine permanently set to lowest during map meta events, and I've got a beefy PC (I7 7700k, GTX 1080, 16GB DDR4, as well as GW2 sitting on my M.2 SSD), with full player limit I drop down to 10-20 FPS, whereas when there are no players, even in HoT I get 60+ FPS at 1440p
---
To improve performance without killing the look of your game completely, I suggest turning down shadows, post porcessing effects, make sure that Super sampling is not enabled, and the rest of your settings on roughly medium (It will take some trial and error to see what settings you can keep higher than others)
---
There are just limitations to the hardware that you have that you're going to have to work around by playing with settings, but hopefully this gives you a better idea of what you're working with and how to get the most out of it.
---
The worth of a title is always in the eye of the beholder. There is no advantage connected to it. An exception could be that other players use the title as proof of something you did, e.g. to form groups, but that is likely not the case here.
---
The real question is: do you want it so badly that you are willing to cash that much for it? If yes, then it is worth it for you, if no, then not. That's something, only you can decide.
---
Unpopular opinion but I am happy they are bundling everything-I mean all campaigns and expansions into one package for $40.00.
---
So many people complaining about pricing, but it still a damn good price. Not only that, each individual game still costs 20.00. Who cares if the game is 15 years old, it's still a very popular game 
---
Issue seems to be fixed now with version 1.8.8
---
Great work on the fix
---
You think this package will be available on steam and therefore be affected by sales? I would definately buy it like this at a discounted price. 
---
For that Snowden Drifts heart, I recall you just spam interact to help wounded Seraph to finish it super quick.
---
There really isn't much activity outside of EU Prime on EU, so no, there isn't OCX/SEA. 
---
Fight servers currently would probably be Whiteside Ridge, Ruins of Surmia, and Kodash. The most competitive guilds on EU, in my opinion, currently, are Team Sustain [tS], Pirate Chips [LAYS] Hard Engage [iNc] a French guild that changes their name every week, but is well known as [WWF] or [Whoa], and Angry German Blob [AGB].
---
Well in that case enjoy your picture!
---
Technically the complete collection is $10 cheaper than what it "was". Trilogy + EotN was would cost $10 more than the Complete Collection now.
---
I agree it is rather shit that it charges so much. Everything in the store should be halved unless GW1 starts getting new content again.
---
it really is mostly the torment and/or confusion
---
you never see stuff like condi firebrand or weaver being played..you do rarely see no-torment condi builds such as holo or soulbeast but those have confusion or provide certain perks like extra cc and vuln for holo or not-having-80%-of-your-skills-rooting-you-in-place for slb(compared to the power counterpart)
---
i don't think scholar is enough of a reason anymore cuz it's 5% only, unless you also have traits with a similar function
---
fact of the matter is people stack mirages in these fights not just because of the insane damage but also the ease of use: you can ignore or deal with mechanics extremely easily
---
&lt;3
---
Nice story.
---
My favorite memorie was me playing an unusual healing build on my ritualist in fa. Was protecting a warrior in a 2v2, it was a great fight. Ine of the enemies got mad at the, the other one applauded.
---
I had never again such an intense pvp fight.
---
[hahahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZPqHzFj0WQ)

I want to play ele but many people say it's bad in pvp how bad are we talking I kind of like being the underdog and still coming on top I guess my question is how bad is bad is it unplayablely bad? or just its a lot harder bad?

Makes sense. Thank you for your explanations, they were very helpful.

There actually was a complete edition at one point for 35 euro’s apparently rather than the 30 I said: https://www.gameliebe.com/guild-wars-complete-collection-download-online-kaufen.html

So it’s a 5 euro price increase for a 15 year old game. Hmm. 
---
Yes, bad players ARE the issue, we both agree on that. But to me it's less about learning instabilities and more about just being generally aware of your surroundings. Instabilities by themselves are NOT gamebreaking, failing to adapt to mechanics in general IS, and tough instabilities just snowball against bad groups who already struggle with mechanics.
---
If players are competent and play well with the rest of the group, pay attention to mechanics, practice good rotations, mitigate damage by using dodges correctly, etc., then the instabs are a trivial annoyance. I disagree that all instabilities have a direct counter and that utility swapping by itself makes everything noticeably easier. But if you're already at that "good" level and a better utility means the difference between a 10 minute run and a 15 minute run, even better.

I owe you huge apologies ! Even if you understood a bit of my sarcasm. Obviously. Well. I just came out of the boat. Disgusted. I didn't want to finish the run. No recs. Not finished my dailies... Dis. Gus. Ted. First time ever since one year of daily full runs. It's fact that the last boss is a dpsmeter... But today.... Pff.
---
Thank you for posting something useful instead of just nonsense in an attempt to get Karma. Lol
---
The orange cat is not new. It's one of the HoM rewards.
---
**The** HoM reward.
---
Same happens with laurels. You get the cat tonic, the cat mini, and they you can throw the rest away, because there's no more cats to buy with them.
---
GW2 is a cat collection game. There's some other side-activities, but they are irrelevant compared with getting more cats.
---
What exactly is new? That you can buy it online? Because that's the version I bought as physical copy years ago but for 30€ not 40€. Was there really a problem getting the game? Because I saw it not too long ago on steam for a reduced price. 
---
[It's not that it's a bad price-point.  It's that it's a price hike compared to the past several years where gameliebe set the price.](https://imgur.com/a/plBaJPF) I suppose all I can really say is that I'm glad I picked up my alt-account when I did this past year. 
---
Of course! It would be a pleasure.
---
Thank you for comment Add me in game Delilah.7513( i'm french \^\^' )  
---
May the best man(girl) win! huhu
---
no no, cuz you see, a few people had fun sliding around for 5min once..so it means the entire playerbase has to suffer at the abomination that is slippery slope
---
&gt;The ones that run into melee are easily cleave-able and the ones that range from the top of the ramp are squishy af
---
If you run 12 maybe. This statement is negated by a staggering amount of instabs:
---
* No Pain No Gain + Quartermaster makes them insanely tanky and Quartermaster is an Elite Add so it takes some time to take down
---
* Last Laugh + Cleaving all melee adds at once = How to wipe your PUG instantly
---
* Afflicted applies Torment which means running around to the sides makes you take a lot of damage if you don't have condi cleanse at the ready
---
* Social Awkwardness + Stacking on the sideline enemies **will** push one or more teammates into Wind/shark/Cone/Water
---
* Adrenaline Rush/Vengeance makes cleaving multiple mobs at once dangerous af
---
* Outflanked has been elaborated enough
---
* Slippery Slope aka "How to die by trying to melee an enemy standing on a ramp then sliding off and getting killed by fog conditions"
---
* Sugar Rush makes you not wanna get focussed by the ramp enemies or you'll see your health plummet
---
* We Bleed Fire means that attacking clumps of enemies at once (such as the ones stacking on ramp) sends waves of Fire Bullets across the ship. Your teammates might not be thankful of that.
---
That leaves us with 4 Instabs that are horrible in this fight no matter if you kill adds or not (Birds, Boon Overload, Frailty, Hamstrung) 2 that aren't too bad either way (Flux Bombs, Mists Convergence) and 2 that encourages stacking on the adds first (Stick together, Toxic Trails).
---
For the record, I'm not saying killing the adds shouldn't be done or that the fight is oh so hard undoable not possible wtf Anet, just that A) The adds aren't as easily taken out with most instabs as you make it seem (and a far cry from the Irukandji of Jade Maw) and B) that the fight was, as said, clearly not developed with instabs in mind which makes "doing the fight as it was designed to be" sometimes not an option. Cleaving the mobs if possible and taking out the quartermaster should in most cases be a priority yes. Trying to take out all of them before proceeding to damage Crowe further, especially while entering &lt;30% HP territory might however not be the best option with most instabs.
---
Well, pure speculation, but:
---
\- It won't be melee (we already have reaper)
---
\- It won't be utility/support (we already have scourge for barriers)
---
\- Most likely not shortbow/longbow/rifle - they don't make sense and there's plenty other classes with that.
---
So the only thing left is shield. Maybe a tanky Death Knight kinda spec?
---
I'm not entirely sure about what I remember, but I think there was indeed something about factions being not that successful in China. I think it was still okay, but it seems like they would've had more success of they released something different.
---
&gt;We don't have mega servers in WvW. It is region based NA and EU. And they are not called worlds, they are called servers. There will be a  change in a milion years or never and at that point it is stated it will be called worlds. But at this point i hope this will never happen.
---
Ding dong, you are wrong. From the wiki: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World
---
&gt;**World** is the term used to indicate the group of players on your team in [World versus World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World); it has little impact on open world [PvE](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvE). There are 51 worlds in the two regions in the Western Hemisphere: 24 in the North America (NA) region and 27 in the European (EU) region
---
'Server' is not an official term used by arenanet to distinguish WvW teams; 'World' is. Additionally:
---
**&gt;Server**: Players often use the term server as a synonym for world, comparing them to servers in other MMOs. However, in Guild Wars 2, map instances are created on a [virtual server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtualization) shared by all worlds. 
---
Every **world** in North America is on the same virtual **server**, which is what I was referring to in my post. Arenanet uses specific nomenclature to denote the structure of its game and using alternate or nonspecific terms is just confusing to new players.
---
You can most definitely jump in GW1, just write /jump!
---
It’s a little missleading to say it’s very pay to win. It’s more of a buy to play mentality. The games got a f2p option which already gives you a lot for a free to play basis, but the full game is really with both expansions. It’s kind of expected that you’ll get both expansions eventually, and Anet is very generous with the sales they do, often having both expansions on sale for $30, so after you drop that you get the entire game. 
---
But yeah the game is very much worth getting into and worth well beyond $30. 
---
Maybe if they'd stop killing everything for their hoaxy traditional "medicine"...
---
I wish I had money to give you gold but I'm unemployed, feelsbadman.
---
Give us a minion tank spec that is able to buff! 
---
Near the tents down hill from the waypoint. Interact with the soldier to restore their morale, then keep spamming because even though the soldier is now fine the dialogue stays there. Did it like that this morning
---
clarification: my argument was that it's not real advice, just arrogance, to tell someone to "go back to t3"
---
it's not meant to support it in any way, it's the main argument
---
if my goal was what you imply it would be something like "you arrogant cunt", which would indeed be a personal attack
---
reading comprehension 0(this was personal btw)
---
As stated multiple times in this thread, the same logic behind power classes dropping dps due to mechanics during their burst combo applies to condi classes as well. Soulbeast Torch 5 is a persistent field and easily gets walked out of. Same with Berserker LB F1, Engi Bombs/Flametgrower 4, Ranger Traps, etc.
---
Condi classes lose direct damage and future damage ticks from conditions as they run off to do a mechanic. It hurts just as much, it's just a smooth dip in dps as opposed to spikes.
---
Especially compared to games like Lord of the Rings Online; where you'd have to shell out 200-300 dollars to have everything.
---
Especially compared to games like Lord of the Rings Online; where you'd have to shell out 200-300 dollars to have everything. The price-point for entry on that game is terrible.
---
How many hours of story gameplay is in it with all the expansions? Is the story soloable? What aspects of the game require more players to do and is there enough players to do it?
---
Yeah, when I read *"Explore the original Guild Wars® without limits!"* I figured it'd mean they had bundled mercenary slots into this package, but nope those are still incredibly expensive. If they had done this then it wold have made sense.
---
You shouldn't compare an illegal keyseller (yes those keysellers are illegal in germany) with an official offer. 
---
You really should use [official retrailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/de/retailers/#Germany-physical). It's not worth to risk a ban only for a few euros.
---
11th of December, 2018.
---
You can read about it [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/December_2018) but the gist of it is that across all professions traited extra damage (Like Chilling Nova) can no longer crit but deal increased baseline damage to make up for it in PvE. But due to reaper permacritting with those traits previously, this is a straight nerf because the % increase doesn't make up for what was lost. Additionally, the Spectral Skill Line has been reworked to be standalone traits/skills instead of a cohesive thing, but they're mostly pretty shit except for one - Soul Barbs (ex. Spectral Master) which gives you 10% flat damage increase upon entering and exiting shroud. Seems great right? Until you realize that Anet saw that they almost buffed Reaper and that can't be so they instead took away the flat damage increase from Strength of the Undeath. Since in a Power Reaper Rotation you'd normally stay above 50% Life Force at all times anyway, this is another nerf as the uptime of the 10% damage increase is lower (down from 100%). 
---
In the End Power Reaper lost 1-5k DPS depending on your build and can no longer break the 30k barrier.
---
The Unbound harvesting tool does multiple hits in one use.  
---
I'd like to find out which mining and logging tools do this, also.  
---
@OP:  The reason they have for offering what they offer in the store is, that's what they decided to offer.  Like, they don't have to make things priced the same, they just price them at a level that they think we'll pay.
---
Wait, so this box can't possibly have eternity too, right?
---
Never played the originals but have been looking for an opportunity to try these out. Going to be an instabuy for me
---
For the one of the southeast hearts in Caledon where you have to kill undead, you can run further southeast and there will be a swampy area where there's a ton of undead just standing around. Neither are hard hearts, but it's easier to AoE mobs down that interact with objects and kill things one at a time.
---
The truffle pig heart in Kessex can mostly be done just killing the grubs and veteran ettin that spawn there. Then you need either 2-3 truffles or wait for mobs to start respawning. (obviously this depends on if other people are there or not).
---
The heart where you destroy branded creatures where the Shatterer spawns can be done almost instantly if you go there when he's up and bomb/mortar a few times.
---
Speaking of world bosses, wait until the Shadow Behemoth is up before doing the Godslost Swamp heart. The mobs and portals spawned by SB count and it's way faster and easier than running all around the swamp looking for portals and lost spirits. Set a timer for when SB is going to be up and do other map comp in the meantime unless you like doing tedious hearts.
---
I out dps'd two of our three condi Mirage on Matthias as cBS last week. The two pulls prior I was top dps as cSlb by over 3k, and that was with poison instead of flame trap and without properly debonding on shortbow. The class isn't the say all end all for raiding, the majority of it is player skill and reaction to mechanics.
---
Still my favourite raid boss. No fussy mechanics like getting the green orbs in Dhuum or boring ass shit like kiting hands in Demios. Just good old fashioned challenge for the group as a whole. 
---
Thanks for the update! Is like to see someone test it with an AMD graphics card. The device states that DX12 with feature 12.1 is required, but AMD cards only support 12. 
---
Since I'm using an RX580, I'd like to see if it works. I saw one comment that they had to reinstall the game? It could've been related to this issue.
---
&gt; How many hours of story gameplay is in it with all the expansions? Story alone? I'd wager maybe 100 or so if you do quests and take your time without rushing to the end. That's counting ALL of them as one game.
---
&gt; Is the story soloable?
---
Very, especially if you have Heros which were introduced in Nightfall and are also given to you in Eye of the North, but you can't start the game there.
---
&gt; What aspects of the game require more players to do and is there enough players to do it?
---
PvP. Probably not. Game is very much old and very much stale. But I'd say the game is still worth it.
---
It is an interesting topic. GW2 is NA based, or that's where it is developed. What I mean, games like Black Desert Online (that is based in South Korea) is like at least one expansion ahead of other parts of the world. So I'd say that NA and EU pretty much get all the new content first, while other regions depend on secondary studios that adapt the game language-wise and other key aspects. 
---
This, though it's possible that the AMD card doesn't support DX12.1 and that's the reason why it doesn't work
---
It's still a 15 year old MMO. Sure Guild Wars uses a gameplay model that makes you a lot less reliant on other players than conventional MMOs, but playing with heroes will only get you so far. E.g. I think you have to be pretty desperate to try the Deep or Urgoz Warrens with just heroes.
---
And we're not even talking about a remastered Guild Wars that looks nice and modern, like you see when other companies charge that for a 15 year old game.
---
Considering the amount of crap you get? It's worth it, especially considering the amount of AAA 60$ games out there that give you 5hours worth of game that you can finish in a single sitting. 
---

reality: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/da/Mini_Orange_Tabby_Cat.jpg
---
Tnx a lot &lt;3
---
Exactly what I thought, I mean really I don't care I suppose since I got all the games when they were brand new. But 40 Dollars is way too much, it's not even like there's a production cost is there? I tried to see if I could find anything but afaik it's not a boxed copy, just a download link?
---
Holy crap, is it? A new game is like $120 where I live lol
---
Fuck yes thankyougif, I hate gimmicks, especially if heavily RNG or repetitive... Matthias is a good, honest, old-fashioned boss fight.
---
Finishing the HoT story gives you access to the Knight of the Thorn quest which lets you get an ascended weapon. It's generally considered the easiest way to get your first ascended weapon, but that's assuming the player is going to play through the story anyway. I don't know if it would still be the easiest way if you include the entire HoT story.
---
You don’t need the mercs though, you just use the heroes which are enough to get through all the games content.
---
Epi bounce off the sacrifice or no balls
---
For 4 campaigns/expansions. And they're worth it, no matter the age.
---
So I'm doing map completion on my ranger. I noticed a few minionmancers and turret engies standing still letting their pets/turrets kill mobs by herdman's bastion (near bloodfin lake) in the iron marches. I logged out, and then logged back in like 5 hours later. They are all still there, in the exact same spot. Is there something in this area people are farming? It just seems kind of odd to me.
---
Wonderful art style !! 
---
makes me wanna get one of my Thief 😍
---
I think the biggest "new" thing is the complete pack. You used to have to buy the trilogy + EotN separately but now you can buy the whole thing in one purchase.
---
I don't know how much pricing has changed. 
---
Both the Deep and Urgoz are doable with heroes. I remember doing Urgoz with my own "balanced" builds, and the Deep with a team build from pvx (it was a hero team for a single player, which means it's doable with 7 heroes only ... though I was doing it for my 2nd account so I "duplicated" some of the heroes ... making it extra easy).
---
Savings is savings. 5 dollars is a lot for people.
---
&gt; It's not just a trophy (as just the skin unlock could be), it's a tool with practical PvE purposes.
---
So?
---
Wait, you can now flag hero from the 4th to the 7th slot ?  
---
I waited this for like... maybe 10 years.
---
Confirmed, this worked 2 days ago.
---
I feel that'd just be letting the cat out of the bag.
---
Considering that GW2 has around 2 million active players each month I'd guess that atleast a few hundred thousand of them invest most of their time in sPvP
---
I didn't take that out of it.  I took his greatest regrets being his past recklessness, and the deaths of those he sees himself as failing.  Thinking of his cubs tipped him over the edge into tears, but I think it was the sum of all that encompassing his regrets.  If the story directly said that obviously I messed up.  I'll have to reread it.
---
It's actually the reverse of this lol
---
No it is really not worth that much. Game has 15 years, and it is pretty much abandon content, it cost the price of Witcher 3 at premiere maybe even more. Witcher 3 with DLCs is two times cheaper nowdays than this and it is old example. I leave you to contemplate. 
---
I hope you didn't pay for this meal, it's just meat with heat and seasonings and stuff
---
But it's 3 games + an expansion, not only one...
---
Also this pack is cheaper than the previous ways to get all 3 games + the expansion.
---
&gt; with some kind of progression system in place.
---
gtfo
---
I just thought it was weird because there were 5 of them stacked together
---
This is literally a suggested way of showing instead of telling, since it follows Rytlock's thoughts as he finally succumbs to tears and Logan "catches" him and reminds him the others need them.  "Show not tell" is about when a book outlines lore and plot outside of characters entirely, such as in the Star Wars openings.
---
The only show possible in game would be catching Rytlock crying and that would lose all knowledge of the depths of his self-loathing and regrets.
---
People were asking anet to have a look at the store prices because they felt that they were to high. They promised to look into it and THIS is what they came up with. You're right that the price for the whole collection, although I find it strange that you compare getting each campaign individually to getting the complete collection just to say that you safe up to 30 bucks now. And while 1€ per item more doesn't  feel expensive, it still sends a message to your players after you have abandoned the game for years, then have some devs working on it in their free time (unpaid) to then increase prices. I just feel disappointed in them, that they felt that milking the cow while it is still alive is the approach to go for.
---
You shouldn't bring illegal keysellers in here. 
---
Those sites are always cheaper, but it hurts the developer, you risk your account and you also risk your money and often personal informations. 
---
Rytlock wrote a heartfelt letter to my character in the personal story but this is way too private for that.
---
Ok. Then it should be as apparent that because of that same rationale Condi is better than power, because of the reasons aforementioned. But hey, i am most probably wrong.
---
&gt; GW2 has around 2 million active players each month
---
Where does this number come from?
---
