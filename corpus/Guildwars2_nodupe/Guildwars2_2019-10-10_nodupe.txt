Until they officially anwser that. He can still try.

For raids, you stay in your own lane, basically. If you are a DPS, you just DPS. If you heal, you just heal. Hybrid builds just aren't needed, because you know you need 3-4 supports (most people run 4), one banner slave, and the rest DPS. With that comp, you don't need DPS building for more heals, or boons, or survivability. All this is going to do, is throw around useless heals, overcapped boons, and lower your damage. Sometimes you'll have DPS that end up generating might or some other boon just because it's part of their best DPS build, but they aren't going for a worse trait just cause it generates might on crits or something.
---

---
Raid builds are also made assuming full buff uptime, and healers. They don't always translate into an open world build, and aren't always going to most damage you can do while solo. Without quickness and alacrity, a lot of rotations just flat out don't work. They generally have no survivability, and every utility slot will have whatever adds to DPS. For example, in raids, warriors don't really have a heal. It's part of their rotation.
---
Now the meta builds we have aren't exactly all that's viable. The ability to make up your own composition is there. You could have a scrapper tank, and build DPS classes around everyone generating might, and fury, have a tempest healer, and still are basically stuck with Chrono or Ren for alacrity. You can make weird comps work. No one does it though. Everyone assumes the comp is going to be Renegades, Firebrands, Chrono, and Druid (and sometimes Scourges) for the support builds, and one of those builds is going to be tank as well (not the druid or scourge). But if you and 9 friends wanted to get together and build an off meta comp for fun, you certainly could. Otherwise, raid builds are created based on the supports who provide basically all healing and boons.
---
Oh god, its like looking in my mind.
---
...This explains a lot.
---
&gt; The idea of a persistent world game, with millions (or even just thousands) of players, who are all the "Most important character in the story" just doesn't work for any kind of satisfying storytelling or even compelling mechanics.
---
I'd agree with you with literally any MMO's storytelling if I hadn't started playing FFXIV the past few months. I haven't even gotten to shadowbringers yet and the storytelling of this game is some of the best I've seen in any single player or multi player game.
---
Hey that’s the guild I’m in!
---
I’ve been playing with them for a couple of days now. They seem nice. They took me through tier 1 fractals for the first time today which was fun!
---
Hey that’s ScareFactory right? I love that site!!!
---
That's what I had thought at first, but neither of the maps I was on were connected to that event. Gendarran and Fields of Ruin aren't used in that rotation.
---
When my brain still running on win 95 and has to catch up.
---
Orichalcum was also worth more than mithril in those days.  LS1 was a wild time, man.

Letting us consume the Hatched Chili for some type of " magic " will be a good start .

Tag up and start a group ?

Don't do this to yourself if it is the first ascended set you're going to craft .

Best Condition build for open world PVE Scourge?
---
I just wanna nuke all the small mobs down instantly, I do have a tanky build that also does condi damage but now I just wanna nuke them 
---
Any advice would be welcome!
---
This is not correct at all. I had friends who flowed this advice and their ticket took longer because it went to the wrong people first apparently. And wait time is like 3 days for everything right now it seems, not two weeks
---
Currently the LFG is dead for hardcore content, but maybe you can find a quality guild to do it with.
---
From what I understand, most people get their Obsidian Shards from a karma vendor in Straits of Devastation. But based on what I've seen this guy only appears after certain meta-events are completed and basically isn't there 90% of the time. Is there a way I can guarentee a trade with this vendor (i.e. is there a set time where everyone does the metaevent?)
---
Mobile games , hard pass .
---
Woops
---
If you mean FPS then change character limit to lowest, rendering distance to low and maybe shadows off
---
One easy fix for Longbow is to reduce the projectile speed so it's possible to dodge by strafing.  The auto attack damage still needs to be nerfed, but all auto attacks should be nerfed so that they're weak and don't apply conditions.
---
Easiest way to fix this is to make leap and blast finishers in smoke fields apply something other than stealth.
---
The common folk is understandable, they just want to bring food to their families by any means. It's the money hungry guys from the top who choose to lead their fan base astray and are then left to wonder what went wrong. Not an ideal time for pc gaming. Mabye one day we will have salvation

try this one for OW
---
We used to have real guides in olde days, which explained everything... not anymore, sadly.
---
I mean, that old guide is still available: http://dulfy.net/2014/07/21/gw2-mesmer-pve-class-guide-by-sanderinoa/ - but it is significantly outdated (particularly, Greatsword was quite significantly buffed around PoF release - now becoming a viable weapon for Open World, and the guide was written before Mirage added to the game). Probably, it still makes sense to take a look, though
---
Builds rely on specialization.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guardian#Specializations
---
The wiki gives a short summary of each specialization for every profession. If you know these you can get a quick impression of what the build might be about. Glass canon, power damage, condition damage, sustain, support. A water weaver will sustain, a fire air weaver power damage and a fire earth weaver is condi damage.
---
Same goes with weapons. A mace shield guardian should be support, a greatsword guardian should be power dps.
---
I did see a great sword build for the first time last night. Plan on taking a look. Right now I’m using a  Mirage Axe build based on snowcrows.
---
Thanks! I use those sites already. I’ll keep chugging along open world and see if over time I can memorize the build traits and skills in a way that I can maximize my efficiency.
---
So any of the [power reaper builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Necromancer) would to that very easily. If it needs to be condi scourge [something like this would work](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Condi_Minion_Master), really though power is going to burst things down in open world much faster and reaper has great cleave.
---
That only matters to a point, after a certain point in fight you end up with sustained dmg numbers and so burst numbers mean very little.
---
For some reason the way you are wording it it sounds like the slower the fight the better condi is, that is not how it works.
---
The DPS numbers can be counted roughly in 2 groups, burst and sustained. Once you pass the burst threshold and move into the sustained dps area it doesnt matter how long the fight takes.
---
Which is why i asked you how many pugs you met that can meet that criteria where you can push it fast enough for burst dps to be the criteria over sustained dps? I pug a lot and it is so rare that i would believe in unicorns before i believe a pug i join can achieve that.
---
So i am not missing any factors, you are. Taking condi dmg is not selfish DPS gain, it is only true again as i said if the rest of the team is capable of pushing things into the burst dps area which almost never happens.
---
When DHs do 60% of my dmg, and when even in the first 15s of a fight i can be on par with their BURST dmg as condi - i a mnot being selfish, they are just not able to pull what top players do thus their burst dmg becomes irrelevant.
---
Thanks for listening to my ted talk.
---
Hi, there's no rule that you can't take them in login screen. It would be ideal if you took them somewhere that you could have your boots be visible though, although this isn't required as long as your boots are visible in at least one of your shots, although it's really best to never obstruct the view of your armor except perhaps in your posed shot. To explain:  
---
We really want to be able to see all of your armor pieces at some point to know what you're wearing. You do NOT need to list what you're wearing, because it's \*OUR\* job to know what you're wearing. If we can't figure it out among the bunch of us, we shouldn't be judging fashion contests. I'll know from looking if you show up in the correct gear, and if I don't, that's my own fault! Good visibility is the key to good fashion, so just do your best to make sure your armor is clear to see, the shots have good lighting, and that your visual is flattering to your character. If you need help figuring this out, I am always open to assisting you.

I for one do not find enjoyment in parting the red sea
---
Said the crying baby who just sided with far-right misogynists. You must enjoy slapping your own face in front of a mirror. 
---
Also you did an excellent job shaming your parents and showing how low your IQ is.
---
Well you say that if you pay a game sub, you're effectively paying for things you don't want. I'm pointing out that you could make arguments like this for every single piece of the game, and by that logic you would want the game to be cut up as much as possible into pieces that are put on the gemstore so as to avoid paying for something you don't want to work for.
---
Maybe they could make it a "Dust Aura" that prevents targeting but does not make you invisible and doesn't prevent being hit if you stand in the way of attacks like cleaves, aoes, projectiles, etc. It could have some other effect like the other auras, like giving Vigor when hit, or Weakness or Blind to enemies.
---
They could also rename smoke fields to "Dust Field" to make them more generic, since 'dust' can include smoke, but also other suspended stuff in the air like sand dust, saw dust, etc... 
---
They could also make more skills create that field, like Dust Storm and Churning Earth.  
---
Murky Waters already uses a smoke field, but it's kind of weird to make 'smoke' underwater with earth magic. If the field is renamed to "Dust Field", it also makes more sense as dust underwater makes the water murky.
---
I think Crystal Lina is some kind of dota reference. Like uh.. I think there are two mage characters called Crystal Maiden and Lina? I haven't actually played so I'm not positive.
---
I definitely will tomorrow!
---
Amazing! But I won't be able to make it :(
---
&gt;I feel as if the competitive modes of this game are dying and being neglected and that open world is also becoming easier and easier.
---
Well, you're not *entirely* wrong. While it's true that veterans have been taking a break in recent weeks/months, new players are still coming in. You just haven't seen them yet *because* they're just starting. If/when they reach endgame, they'll fill the holes that the veterans have left. 
---
&gt; gear will be completely unnecessary
---
Well they haven't added a new tier in years so I highly doubt the current gear will be obsolete in the future.
---
To understand the Condi-Firebrand using plaguedoctors+DireRabid, condi is about attritive war. In condi builds you ignore power/precision/ferocity mostly as you want some survivability. This frees up a lot of points to stack where it counts. With full might and full sigil charge this build sits at 3100 condi damage and 197+% condi duration (keeping in mind that condi builds account for damage AND Duration) it also has near 20k hp and 3k toughness... I call it the "Burninator" but as firebrand you have survival utilities in tomes and can easily swap to sword/mace/sceptor + shield for blocking and such you set the room on fire and then "out live" the enemy as they burn away.
---
You easy to make any build when you understand how your class work. Or to understand all this build from web.
---
I'd say just enjoy the game and use what you want/feel it needs.
---
no, it is not worth it.
---
Pew pew pew
---
Yes c:
---
They don't mean swearing, they literally don't want that voodoo mumbo jumbo.
---
To understand the Power Dragonhunter using Valkyrie and Assassins... you want max power and ferocity and enough precision to get you with Fury and Retaliation critical stat bonuses close to 90% + crit chance. combine with vulnerability from sword of justice, which also applies stacks of burning to trigger fury... with a Greatsword base + Longbow or sceptor/sword+focus depending on wither you want range or more damage (Anet teeters dmg based on distance btw closer you are to the threat, the higher you dps tends to be) This build melts faces from close or far and with valk stats has enough HP to take a few hits and outlast opponets... this is a "race to zero" warrior where you hope you enemy's HP hits Zero before yours does... but its deals massive quick punishment

I came here to comment about the legend, as was not disappointed to find that you had already invoked his name.
---
What I meant to say is that everything will become so much easier that there will be no need for ascended/legendary gear because Anet will make exotic be the only thing needed for practically everything for the casual players

OMG This is so me! XD

Amazing, she's using the same chest armor as my guardian.  She looks awesome! :D

Despite the benign neglect, WvW can still be insanely fun if you're on or linked to a decent server. If you have a Healbrand you are already a good way towards knowing how to play a support Firebrand in WvW, which is always needed in squads. You need Minstrels armor and trinkets, but you can always use cheaper options while you're getting that set.
---
The fights are harder to find than a few years ago, but there's generally a tag or two most nights to follow (there used to be a tag on each map). The tags on the different servers tend to gravitate towards each other so you can usually get a couple of good hours of fights per night, as long as your server's prime hours match with your opponents.
---
You can already use Exotic for everything. You don't *need* ascended or legendary. The only benefit those give is infusion slots so you can get AR. 
---
OP your problem sounds like you come from a themepark MMO where you can only quantify your strength with bigger numbers. That isn't how GW2 does things.
---
Scourges in WvW are like artillery pieces. Lots of offense and no defense. You need to be in a party with a Firebrand and an Engineer to provide stability, healing, and condition cleanses. As long as you have that you can go full berserker (or marauder for a safer option). If you don't have that then you have to tank up a lot, which defeats the purpose of a scourge.
---
Douchebags are more interesting to observe than normal people.
---
Unpopular opinion: WvW isn't dead because ph one single thing. It's dead because
---
1.) It really hasn't changed in a long time. They put out a map but it sucked so bad they had to make it only one area. 
---
2.) Extreme power creep made some classes near unbeatable in solo fights, others so powerful in group fights that you cant group fight without them, and many that just plainly suck and are unused.
---
1. What the hell is a Legendary Edition? Did they make that up just to make him feel special?
---
2. The LAST thing this game needs is Ninja and his rabid fanbase.
---
&gt;	If you want i can dig through to find the ticket.
---
Go for it.
---
I suspect that it's less of a case by case basis and more that you just happened to get lucky and find some leniency policy-wise from whoever you dealt with.
---
the part about standing in the blackpowder field is an old tactic that still has its value here and then. the point of it is to reduce the capabilities of the thief to leap through the field as hitting him with heartseeker = revealed. Was more effective when short heartseakers were possible and thereby ended closer to the field.
---
It's like a cheetah compared to a tiger. A cheetah's bite hurts. A tiger's bite ends your life.
---
There is. As someone who moved from F2P to full expac, I moved my servers free of cost. With 4 days delay.
---
&gt; ignore the buggers.
---
This is the best solution. Most roamer builds are meant to annoy you to death. If by some miracle you're winning they have so much mobility you will never catch them. They're spec is designed to win in any situation. They either chip you down or they run away. Its just not worth your time to fight them.
---
i have 4 and no way I'm gonna trade those in. to many friends who accidentally sold theirs...
---
Fighting a Celestial Scourge is slightly annoying. Fighting a Berserker Scourge makes you check your combat log to figure how exactly how he killed you.
---
That's a fair point about knowing who the VA is.  Jury's still out on why it matters how an elder dragon identifies, tho.
---
They have enough to play, Getting in more people with this desperate attempt wont raise their playerbases. People will see they're neglected modes and leave.
---
Istan is good once a day

DF/SW  are the current best open world brain afk farms

Ah cool cheers
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1us27/gold_per_hour_open_world_map_benchmarks/
---
If you have a group of friends to do it quickly Daily T4 fractals are probably best gold per hour, but only once a day.
---
Raids are decent, its just harder to find 10 people to do it with, and only once a week.
---
As for ongoing farms currently Dragonfall is the best if you do Kralk -&gt; Bosses -&gt; Events on fresh map(to replenish the keys) -&gt; Kralk -&gt; Bosses you are looking at 30+ gold per hour, but that cycle takes little over 2h. And you need to sell the mats.
---
Are you so bitter now that a little thing like this post is an excuse for another tirade?
---
I just checked the wiki to make sure. for Aurora for the out of shadow Mastery for example you had the choice between 16 out of 28 achievements
---
Can't remember , that achievements annoyed me that had at aurora
---
I would say that a pretty big point for power is also the speed of the split phase to avoid getting too many stacks on you.
---
Wvw is our Savior

I just miss 4 astral weapons and war eternal Mastery

Is it a... goose?
---
There will be a toilet recipe to make it burning. Gift of Fortune + The Pumpkin Head + Gift of "How to train your dragon was a great movie" + Gift of Linseed Oil
---
The devil is in the detail.
---
Firebrand is kinda alone in the middle of condi builds because it has pretty fast ramp up unlike most other condi builds. So showing Condi FB as the mascot for Condi classes is a bit misleading, if you put other less bursty condi specs instead of it the result is not completely the same.
---
A big factor to consider would be the split phase (not for the speedkill aspect of it but rather the safety): if you have mostly Condi classes you know you can leave the hand very early but if you only havea couple you need to stay a bit longer, however since you are in a pug this duration will remain a bit random because you don't know exactly which CD is gonna be committed for which hand for example so you may stay a bit longer than expected on a hand and maybe get an additional stack or bump attack that you did not plan on covering. On that aspect I feel Power classes make the split phases smoother and a bit safer.
---
There is also an Ogre in the Desert Highlands Lommuld Kraal village that stands at the edge of a cliff with a pet Iboga closeby. He's yelling stuff like "I have feathers, I am a biiiird, I can flyyyy" and is about to jump while his friend is trying to convince him to back off because he is hallucinating. It's really funny because he even has a condition below his health bar. (and no, he's not jumping)
---
Saying you have the data and having the data are two different things, of course. When another points out the flaw of your assertion and your only response is to dismiss them and reject the data they introduce, your argument is on rocky ground. Usually being given new data means you have to revise your assertion, or at least that is what occurs in open-minded people. That isn't happening here due to some egotistical stubborness. That isn't on others being objective, but on you for confirmation bias. I already acknowledged that others won't have as many shards as I but you so far have been incapable of acknowledging your own rationalization faults regarding how many shards most people will have.
---
doubt there will be much change to them before release
---
I got an answer yesterday, everything works now.
---
Thanks so much for your suggestions. It seems the german support is having alot more tickets to work through right now than normal.
---
another person coming here from Classic WoW.. Is it possible to play this game fully grouped with 1+ other friends? Any recommendations for class comps?
---
so, not gw2 LULW
---
Map
---
Out of shadows is LW3 E1 which you also need to complete for Aurora
---
This, but for wvw.. insert leather node before going to tower lord.
---
I know, but you could leave some achievements out. You had to complete everything from A Crack in the Ice like War Eternal, that is what I mean.
---
We may indeed be more than a small amount of upset, but that's not the point of the OP... 
---
It's probably true that a great many hours went into the codebase modifications to make this work, and also possible that the devs who did the work are separate from the committee / panel / whatever that decided on the monetization scheme. It's still sad and frustrating that a well intentioned idea turns into a PR mess.
---
Tip: funny is subjective.
---
Yes but do we want any more?
---
I just finished Aurora this week, and didn’t discover that I could just complete the reward tracks until last week. Months of struggling through achievements could have been avoided. Luckily I discovered this before completing LW3E3, and finished the reward track pretty quickly. I completed so many dungeon reward tracks during that time, it’s depressing to think of how I could have finished this much sooner, and all I’d be missing out on were some totally in-used dungeon weapon &amp; armor skins.
---
Oh shit they have blabla? I've been looking for a good with that for ages!
---
You play another role besides damage in this case.
---
You're a beefy healer with heavy armor, that's awesome as well.
---
I do miss the good old days when I would play MM in AB and hold a shrine on my own and people would underestimate the power of my undead army, good times.
---
Your view is pretty common, and as an advocate of arc dps templates, I understand it. But it seems you don’t understand the other viewpoint. I encourage you to formulate an argument after considering the counter arguments.
---
Also, don’t make generalizations like “many of the players are happy with build templates” or “lazy people with 30 builds per character”. Sure some people are happy with templates, but I want evidence that there is a lot of support for them. And is having 30 builds per character lazy or dedicated to min maxing, different roles, and different content?
---
I’m not here to convince you, but to ask you to read up more on what the underlying problems are. There’s waaay too many posts by people like you who don’t recognize the effects of templates on all types of different players.
---
I don’t mind if you still think build templates are good, just find out how build templates could be better for all players, including “lazy people with 30 builds per character”.
---
&gt; I don't trust any programs that are not created by game devs.
---
Where exactly do you draw the line with this? Because I certainly trust arcdps more than Steam, BattleNet0.2, Epic Store, heck even the Win10 store which also distributes games probably comes with spyware galore. And let's not forget ANet themselves spied on us then claimed their system to be "flawless" only to get owned when the GDPR was invoked to review their detection logs.
---
At *worst* I simply don't believe arcdps to be a viable vector for stealing anything beyond GW2 accounts while the stores and launchers are inherently *expected* to run in the background when you aren't playing, download "updates" and in most cases inherently deliver ads (read: exchange personalisation info to target said ads) while also inconveniencing offline play.
---
Build templates aren't being fucked up. They definitely won't work well for the people who benefit from them most (people with dozens of builds) but for the vast majority of players (who are not being vocal about it on social media) build templates are going to be a fantastic addition to the game.
---
For most of us, we are going to get the ability to swap our entire build and gear with just the press of a hotkey. We will free up tonnes of storage space in our bags from carrying multiple gear sets and doing fractals on a class like a ranger will be much more enjoyable because we can instantly swap from DPS to heals almost instantly.
---
As someone with every profession at level 80, geared for group content, some with multiple builds, who frequently plays multiple roles and also jump into WvW, PvE and Open World, the current iteration of build templates is going to be a godsend for me. It's going to make a huge difference to how the game plays for me. I've often simply swapped characters in fractals when I wanted to swap roles, now I can just swap templates and gear instantly.
---
The system isn't perfect. I think build templates are the wrong thing to monetize (gear templates make some sense as storage) but I'm not going to pretend like the system as it's currently proposed isn't going to be incredible for me and others like me.
---
&gt; If you need more than 6 *gear* template slots
---
But yeah, the auto-update functionality isn't that great either. Maybe they should have designed it so that the first slot is just your regular equipment, and equipping a template just copy+pastes it into that first slot. Then if you actually want to make permanent changes, you could edit the template itself instead of the current equipment loadout, so to speak.
---
Most people don't care about novelties but that was not the point of OP here, it was about the quality of the features. The things is if you want a specific novelty you have to do 3x things to equip it, so it is fucked.
---
Join a RIBA group in LFG - squads, teleport to Silverwastes. Then, during the Upgrade Defenses part of the meta, run in a circle Red Keep -&gt; Indigo Cave -&gt; Blue -&gt; Amber, tagging all events (but not staying at them until completion), meaning you kill some event mobs to get credit so that you'll get the rewards when the event ends. The point of that is to maximize the amount of bags and stuff you get from event rewards. When that part of the meta is completed, each keep will have spawn a plant maw-looking breach that you jump into, and there you have to kill a boss. When all 4 bosses are killed, the main boss will spawn in a couple of minutes at the westmost part of the map. People spread out to 3 lanes leading to it, kill their champions when their path is open, then get the loot.
---
Then comes the treasure part. You run around the map after the commander (or just with the main body of your squad), and loot Lost Bandit Chest that people dig with Silverwastes Shovel. That continues for \~18 minutes until the meta resets. You will also get Greater Nightmare Key, which you use to open a big chest in the tangled labyrinth in the south part of Silverwastes. 
---
After all that you get various mats and gear you can sell, but most importantly - 3 types of bags, Bag of Gear, Embroidered Coin Purse and some 3rd one, I don't remember. 
---
You make a character, level them to 50-52 (no more no less) and send all bags to him. Such a character is called bag opener and yes everyone does that. The point of it is that these bags give level appropriate gear, and items  around that level salvage into the most profitable materials. Then you open all bags on him, salvage everything and sell the results. There's you 20g+ per hour.
---
Damage doesnt "really" matter that much anyway.
---
You stack 15-20 scourges in a 50-60 man zerg.
---
They hit 10 targets. Everything should die from this regardless if zerker or cele. 
---
Zerker is higher risk/reward and cele was always the save option.
---
And if the day comes where you find yourself branching out and you start using several builds and realize that even after spending $20-30+ for one single character, you still don't have enough templates available, you can join the rest of us in our displeasure.
---
To be fair those mines (and I also cut all the trees back when soft wood was still worth a penny)  probably give more gold than the guild mission itself.
---
I've been using arcdps on Linux for almost a year now. That was never an issue.
---
Oh nice, I tried but had issues with it.  Did you do anything special, or just stick to the windows install instructions?
---
Something I wish would have been done with the novelty system is have an option to remove it and have a useable item in your inventory again. Or a vendor to purchase it as an item if you already have it unlocked.
---
Dead game.

Now I imagine spellbrraker just beating up ppl with his dagger skills + all his physical skills. (And go super sajan, when entering rampage elite) :'D
---
&gt; I can just face tank pretty much 80% of encounters. The only reason I dodge is because I get amplified damage for a few seconds ... I've been running fracs missing 20AR and I barely even notice.
---
i.e. make them easier than without the mentioned classes
---
Works well for organized group. If you run in a public, it is a really bad choice.
---
Ding ding ding we have a winner
---
What you talking about? Press F4 and you fear instantly, press F3 and you immediately get the barrier. Press F2 and you immediately cleanse a condi. I don't remember them adding an activation time. There certainly isn't any casting time. And even if there is one, is not really a thing as I didn't notice it, like, ever.
---
I dunno, I feel like the novelty system was a great thing in that people couldn’t coordinate and fill a huge area with novelty shit. It might be fun for **them** but I remember it differently, differently in that it was more irritating some times than other times.
---
&gt; But it seems you don’t understand the other viewpoint. I encourage you to formulate an argument after considering the counter arguments.
---
Considering his argument amounts to you suck and are lazy by having multiple builds I highly doubt he has an open enough mind to do that.
---
&lt;3
---
That's exactly my point. They make the fractals way too easy because all damage is mitigated ... There's zero challenge in pugging T4 fractals. Whereas T3 can be quite a bit harder.
---
&gt; "But it's just efficient".
---
I don't know about you guys but I enjoy challenging end game. The excuse that I can run them without those classes is stupid as hell. I can also play the game with no gear and 2 less party members. It doesn't mena it's stupid that a single party member can turn the fractal from "skillful dodging and applying boss mechanics" to "just nuke until he dies, I outheal".
---
that was op's point, chronomancer and healbrand do to much, so his run is ruined; 
---
my take on this: op should play support instead, or maximize dps and brag about it :p
---
Fun challenging content to "just stand still and nuke, don't bother dodging I outheal and block everything for you".
---
I think that hfb is a symptom, really. People who cared about the fun of gw's endgame content quit/are in the process of quittting and those who are left are mostly farmers, interested in easy rewards and aren't by any means interested in challeging/engaging gameplay. Wheelchair hfb setups provide just that.
---
I see this as an endstate of the game. On one hand it ensures that even harder fractals and fractal CMs will still be "played"(=farmed) even after their developement stopped (since it is possible to get a god reward/effort ration for them even with a relatively low skill, unlike a lot of the raid encounters), on other hand death is prefferable.
---
Not sure what is a problem with chronomancer tho, it lost it's carry potential months ago, not sure who even uses it still.
---
or just undress the pants as all the traditional lab runs are met to be
---
but auto attacks are meant to be less impactful
---
I'm mostly after things with pepper. Your infos help me a lot. I figured some of that out but wasn't sure if it is the best way. Also I totally forgot about the karma tools. I think I'll wrap up some ascended ingredients and decide then if I finish cooking or just sell the things.
---
look up [fast]
---
was posted around here few days ago.
---
Easy: you play mirage---&gt;mirage farts comfusion---&gt; so many confusion confused your clones and confused you
---
Templates were never intended for average player. If they decided to develop them they should have in mind thatvthe target audience for the feature would be a part of the playerbase that is already using arc templates.
---
+plus 1one
---
Its the same as at any other workplace. Ppl are leaving, new ppl coming. Nothing special.
---
&gt; because party is carrying your ass.
---
That's it
---
I find facetanking very analogous to stand still and nuke.  In other words, what you're suggesting with you facetank strat is just another way to "stand still and nuke".  
---
Many people like playing support classes, and they are handy to have just in case somebody fat fingers a skill and screws up their rotation or some other surprise.  It's better to have a safety net and not need it than not have one when you do need it.
---
Please don't ever breed.
---
I said meant, not are.
---
:Dodge:
---
&gt;Templates were never intended for an average player. 
---
You guys say that about literally everything Andy announces, can you give it a rest already? They always develop content with a majority of players in mind. That’s just business, it’s a smart move. Why would you waste a ton of development time an effort something that a tiny subset of players was going to buy into? That wouldn’t make any sense.
---
&gt;If they decided to develop them they should have in mind that the target audience for the feature would be a part of the playerbase that is already using arc templates.
---
What’s the point? Those people are still going to use mods. They were never the target.
---
OP wants to dodge more often as that makes it for a challenging and fun run. If there is a healer or whatever other support class they have, it lets them stand still AA'ing, tanking all the damage. Hence why supports are ruining their otherwise fun fractals.
---
My dude it seems you completely miss the point. I do *not* want to face-tank. I do not face-tank in T3 pugs, because I can't. It's chrono and healbrand that allow you to face-tank, and it sucks.
---
Are they half-bear too? ;)
---
You mean proper builds and teamwork make group instanced content a lot easier than  a bunch of people playing completely on their own individual skill?
---
\*Say it ain't so!\*
---
&gt;Because back when I played the vast majority of players were still the 80%-90% super-casual players every MMORPG has, that consume open world content and just run around and do stuff as it pops up, or chainfarm a zone without giving much thought to optimizing for it.
---
Yeah a lot of people fail to consider that the player base matures over time, as tends to happen the longer an MMO exists, Matured in that they’ve passed beyond open world exclusivity.
---
The Black one looks like a sick extreme metal band logo.
---
well its always a point of view. I really liked the novelty tab and still like it as it is, the only thing that I am missing there, is that I´d love to see all the 5 equiped things in my skillbar rather than just that little square.
---
The announcement was exactly, even a bit more than I expected, they announced an living story announcement and also came up with build templates, so I was 150% satisfied.
---
And about build templates, they are not out yet, so I am not sure how I will like them, but as far as I know right now, they will also satisfy me. I mean they could be better, with more; maybe infinte slots to buy but even two slots will change my gameplay in a massive way ( I ve beeen waiting for 7 years now sooo im very happy) 
---
But still there is one thing I dislike, since someone here on reddit asked, if they could make that the items selected for build templates could be added right in there and leave the inventory I hardly disliked this idea and didnt thought they would actually do that, but well they did it and I was very surprised, but I dont think that will lead into a disappointment at the end, its just not perfect for me
---
Minion Master necromancer. Sadly that got nerfed into oblivion with the release of GW2. Give me back my Aura of the Lich, dammit.
---
My husband plays his that way mostly. I've got : my main Ele, who runs DPS Weaver, my 2nd Ele I heal with but not often, my 3rd whose a condition Weaver/Tempest and my 4th  running a tankier version of my DPS Weaver that I use only in WvW. There's a lot you can do with an Ele, thats why I have 4 !
---
wvw alliances were very clear that they will take a very long time to implement, because its a huge and very very complex feature. 
---
And well swiss tournaments are likely more complicated than expected, since they already struggle with the monthly tournaments. I really dont know whats going on there, but maybe there is a legit unexpected reason for that and they didnt planned to delay it for that long
---
What? It's very special. You know why they don't update dungeons? Because nobody can work with the code, everyone who wrote dungeons are gone. You know why they don't update UI stuff/takes them a *very* long time to do any tiny update? Nobody knows how it works. You can say the same about the majority of the game at this point.
---
Losing your entire staff that created the architecture of your game is not good. There is no way that the company/people aren't suffering immensely because of this.
---
Imagine you get a programming job at Anet and you're sitting there infront of 5 million lines of code across 40,000 different files in a dozen languages and the only help you have is sparse, outdated documentation and a few comments buried in various bits of code. You can't ask the guy who made it any questions about what to do or how it works and how not to break things, you have to sit there and discover how it all works and you'll never get a good understanding of it without literally months or even possibly years of studying the whole thing. At best it takes you literally years to implement a system like build templates and find insurmountable but at the same time trivial problems such as being limited to 6 templates per character because you can't figure out how a quirk of the UI is stopping you from doing this and you have no time or knowledge on how to get around it.
---
Sure, nothing special! Fucking idiot.
---
Nope they are not... Frosty (Patrick our old ZoS guild lead), Gaile, now Mike, Izzy, Regina, Lindsey (from gw1 mods teams)
---
Appears all gone.
---
In gw1 a couple years back they actually successfully hacked Gailes moderator account.. stole/deleted her Frog minis and use the mod powers to remove gold trims from a bunch of guilds (mine was one of them before the damn gw1 hackers actually hacked my account and stole it/Sold it for real life currency at a botter website called Epvp)
---
Still hurts my heart today but after awhile you realize they can take the pixels but they can never take your accomplishments (from irl).
---
So yeah gw1 history is a bloodstain of botters and thieves now and basically every Dev who worked the original game has moved on (and no... not to gw3 but screw it... guilds don’t even fight anymore so truly the namesake it nice but guilds at war.. or the “guild wars” as we all knew it.. is long dead)
---
Story continuity will continue to suffer and new players won’t care because they aren’t tied to old places (like cantha) how we are... soo the game loses more and more history until it’s basically just a gemstore and fashion wars.
---
Yep fashion wars.. ohh how far the “guild wars” have fallen
---
&gt; No everyone is allowed 
---
Well that says a lot about you guys then. Pretty much everything I needed to know tbh.
---
&gt; but you gotta go through training 
---
Unlike where?
---
&gt; This place is very open to people talking with the community 
---
Funny how nobody seems to...
---
Just like in blizzard, havent play wow since 2008/9, I log in to gw2 to play on harp and talk in chat (not sure if I kill a single mob this year), but I played some gw1 recently.
---
I count 3 top answers missing the point and 7 who understood but not necessarily agree.
---
I am a roamer primarily and I speak from experience as a necro.
---
Every class that has good interrupts and can slow skill refresh basically eats me alive if I somehow don't do the same to them in the first few precious seconds.
---
So it's kinda 50/50 chance.
---
I don't like it too much as well. I would have loved if warrior would hold the daggers the opposite way around, like a short sword. But now comes the "pretend, to just hit people with your fist" part into play:
---
AutoAttack = double b*tch slapp, into a bud spencer fist to the head move
---
Skill 2 = Falcooooon PUNCH
---
Skill 3 = super fast punch into the guts
---
Skill 4 = mega b*tch slapp
---
Skill 5 = OrraOrraOrraOrraOrraaaa..
---
ah i get it now, he wasn't very clear on *how* they were ruining runs for him.
---
I don't see how chronomancer has anything to do with this though, they hardly provide any defensive support
---
You misread. I want anything worth the effort. What I don't want is the 10k karma joke. I just threw a random idea, immediately followed by the part you missed : "or find something better than karma". Now if it HAS to be karma, then it has to be a high amount, not something that makes literally 0 difference in your wallet.
---
Open world is more of the same every two months.  Slightly changed events to accomplish a common goal.  The rewards are the same with only new icons (map currencies).
---
Competitive modes aren't competitive and have no reason to be.  PvP guilds haven't been a thing in years because of a variety of reasons.  ESL pulled out, PvP is boring to watch, PvP didn't get the competitive updates it needed (roaming camera), fundamentals weren't really taught, etc.  WvW is mostly the same.  GvG support never came and after the arena in Obsidian Sanctum got boring, the best guilds got bored because the chest thumping just went in circles.  There was nothing to show for it or to compete regularly with those that wanted to play at the highest level.  WvW now is maybe 5 talented players in a group of 30 just winning by sheer numbers.  I'm on Blackgate now and I don't even have to try because of how big the zergs are.  Its a false sense of being good at the game.
---
I think you can still have fun in PvP or WvW but I wouldn't expect anything to get better.  Swiss and Alliances definitely won't be enough.  Tip of the iceberg kind of thing.  Anet is so out of touch with the community, take GW2 for what it is, not what it could be.
---
thread from a few days ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/de1tsb/look_at_this_dear_gw2_community/
---
try again.
---
He calls people lazy who wanna be efficent in for example killing raidbosses and have on one class different builds for each boss.
---
Dude, you are to lazy to even try to get better or get better dps or whatever so u just play with one build the entire raid. AND YOU CALL OTHERS LAZY???
---
With someone like you it is impossible to argue, you sound like a flat earther or some anti vaxx bulshitter.
---
Some of them are also hairy, yes.
---
so tell me how they screwed up the pure mechanic of a template? you can literally save everything you want +  get free storage. how the fuck is that "screwing up *all across the line*" ?
---
&gt;wvw alliances were very clear that they will take a very long time to implement
---
I first thought, well less people working on it means more time. Why dont they put in more devs? Oh wait, maybe after all the achievements they **timegated** wvw development, too? THAT would explain so much.   
---
*"I could write this code today, but I can only write one line of code each day. If I come to work every day I might be finished 2020. Oh fuck, its account limited, not character limited ... KAREN can you write one line of code? No? Oh well then 2020 it is"*
---
&gt; They make the fractals way too easy because all damage is mitigated 
---
Play CM's, where you actually have to pay attention to mechanics, dodge properly, while still executing perfect burst dps phases.
---
&gt; There's zero challenge in pugging T4 fractals. 
---
The challenge (in normal T4's) is more about how quickly you can finish them, rather than **just** managing to finish them.
---
CM's on the other hand are designed to be the "real" challenge.
---
&gt; I don't know about you guys but I enjoy challenging end game.  
---
Which is what Raids &amp; CMs are for, normal T4's are basically just a gold farm.
---
&gt; The excuse that I can run them without those classes is stupid as hell.  
---
There's always going to be an optimal way to do things tbh, every team based game in history is guilty of this.
---
I play with a static group, and we fuck around with different comps all the time, but most pugs will always prefer doing things the most efficient way possible... and i don't personally see anything wrong with that.
---
deadeye/payback/daggerstorm... combined with perma quickness and you will tag nearly everything.
---
right traited, you will also not die, because heal on hit, crit and kill
---
Yes, because they were implemented like that. You have two-handed, one-handed (linked to both slots) and off-hand weapons. While all one-handed main weapons can be equipped in the off-hand, off-hand weapons are hardcoded to only fit there.
---
cringe
---
cringe x2
---
Reminds me of Winter 2017(tm)
---
&gt; Build templates? Same thing. Years of work and man-hours and development time
---
Yes, years lost in meetings with "should we? if so how to monetize it?". Then implemented in 20h top done by one guy.
---
Well, I mean that it still provides offensive quickness/alacrity, sure, but this is baseline function that must be fulfilled in any case. Even there chrono  loses because it doesn't have a good partner that would be able to fill all the missing offensive boons, while adding enough gropu dps to be competitive with qfb/rene combo.
---
 What it lost are defensive/utility  capability, stability spam, heals, huge amounts of cc, effective distortion share. Chaos chrono used to be the similar kind of "do everything while others do numbers" class like hfb, just more fun and complex.
---
I guess for every fetish you have there is also a culture where it's normal. Then again - norn is my favorite race, because if I were to become woman I would probably want to be a big burly bear of a girl; but in life I had chosen someone smaller to be my wife. Segregate your virtual and real life folks!
---
&gt;Years of work and man-hours and development time  
---
  
---
more like, a day. maybe 2. they spent more time trying to figure out how to market it than to actually make it.
---
I would find it amazing if daggers were ranged weapon for warrior (vendetta style)
---
Well, good luck. Raids have the similar situation, except that instead of being able to safely farm them even if in boring setups, masses wipe constantly, get frustrated and leave, at best regularly clearing some easier bosses. 
---
Surely there are still some people and groups that do enjoy content itself (just like in fractals), but in the current situation their numbers dwindle constantly, and by the time you will accumulate enough experience (and kp) to get there... yeah, good luck to  you.
---
^ This here folks
---
Fallout76 is the perfect example of this.  
---
Game had a terrible launch.  
---
Bugs probably from TES:Obsidian.  
---
lack of an endgame.
---
And yet, despite all that the Fo76 community is still reasonbly positive.  
---
Why?  
---
[This is a search of their **weekly** blog posts where they talk about what they have done, problems with it and upcoming stuff](https://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;as_epq=FALLOUT+76%3A+INSIDE+THE+VAULT&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;lr=&amp;cr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_sitesearch=https%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2Ffo76)
---
Even though actual progress has been slow AF and they have majorly fecked up raids and "dungeons" folks are still willing to invest time and effort in teh hopes that they improve it.
---
TLDR: Fo76 is fecked but they know how to do PR in a competent manner
---
nice one
---
So what do you want? 5 random ppl with random specs and random equipment?
---
This game is ment to be played with others. Others provide you with boons and class bonuses or skills that enchance you in combat. Why is this kind of design a problem? Go play a fps if you feel like playing alone.
---
Well, the only thing people really complain about is the monetization and the hard limits to the amount of templates, both things that
---
1. can be changed without making huge changes to the actual system
---
2. are unlikely to change, because ANet likes money
---

---
That's a whole lotta powah.
---
&gt; Nope. Balanced game design. Efficient comps, yes. Comps that completely remove any difficulty of the game? No. 
---
Give me an example what does the firebrigade comp ruin? What are the bosses that you can just facetank on a  glasscannon thief? Also comparing T3 and T4 is just dumb 'cause when ppl advance they usually also learn and become better even though difficulty rises. The said "difficulty" in T3's is that in there ppl actually run bearbows and condi thiefs or what ever nomad warriors so their comps don't synergize at all. Combine this to the fact that T1s and T2s are a joke so ppl don't learn before T3s. T4s aren't supposed to be impossible. 
---
Nothing in this game is supposed to be impossible. There just isn't end game content you seek (and many other do too, including me). But I've come to peace with the thought that there will never be a new CM for fractals nor do I wait for a new raid wing next year.
---
What’s wrong with my fingers? I know they aren’t modeling fingers😰 but they are just fingers working fingers 🤣
---
and the other guy just said "well, they 100% fucked it up" without any context. 
---
but thats better, because it fuels the hate agenda towards templates guys like you are pushing, right?
---
A community manager wouldn't have been able to fix this. The error is one of design. A community manager is hardly involved in the design on new features. It's more likely that either
---
1. The designers don't play the game; or
---
2. The designers were given a heavy-handed monetization goal, and were forced to create a half-hearted solution to meet it.
---
[Reminder to not donate to the Susan G Komen Foundation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa4pzXv5QA0)
---
In a lot of fights one healer is enough by far but pug groups still run two full healers since there are so many pugs who can't dodge/sidestep.
---
You also have the option of different gameplays, it is a very versatile class.
---
I think their work as a studio is great. I see nobody denying that the work the put in isn't terrible.
---
The issue is their decisions as a company that ruins it and their reputation. Like the decision to monetize something like Build Templates that SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME AT LAUNCH and making us not only wait 7 years, but pay out of pocket for too.
---
I mainly blame Mike Z and NCSoft for letting these obviously bad decisions pass through. Mike knows the situation and he reads about it all the time. The state of the game, the communities thoughts and feeling and this mother fuck just sits there and doesn't do a damn thing about it. Can't speak for him, but I wouldn't be surprised if his mentality is "They'll just buy it anyway" which is a shitty coming from someone who is the head of the whole studio.
---
this is one of the many reasons roaming isn't actually pvp and nobody can/should take it seriously or expect a remotely fair fight
---
It was so much fun back then, I enjoyed playing it mostly in PvP.
---
Getting a precursor drop.
---
Yes, I know, scavenger hunts, and they are fun.
---
You die if your healthbar reaches zero while illusion of life is on you. You can still go into downed state again after not scoring a kill within 15 seconds.
---
Is it really a reference when Ibogas have always been a part of the franchise and are in fact the same area these people are?
---
I think because of the phrase "Now this is a nice find". Its complety bs to post it here xD
---
Flies away.
---
i wouldn't be so sure about this. True, this repetable track can mutate with new episodes to add the new currencies that become available, but we don't know for sure. Maybe each episode will follow the same pattern and have their own track.
---
In any case i have not even completed the one time tracks and i'm already swimming on pepper after playing maybe 4-5 days of this new episode. If future episodes are going to be like this one i won't even need any headstart or anything if i can get so many currency in such a short amount of time.
---
Ah, thats it. Thanks.
---
Here is a fun fact for you: once upon a time, warrior banners, a single elementalist stacking 25 might for the first ten seconds of the game and a single time warp of a mesmer was all the other three warriors got in terms of support.
---
Yeah, the game changed a lot.
---
Since Asura are such a unique GW2 thing... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura
---
**Asura**
---
Asuras (Sanskrit: असुर) are a class of divine beings or power-seeking deities related to the more benevolent Devas (also known as Suras) in Hinduism. 
---
The asuras battle constantly with the devas. Asuras are described in Indian texts as powerful superhuman demigods with good or bad qualities. The good Asuras are called Adityas and are led by Varuna, while the malevolent ones are called Danavas and are led by Vritra.

&gt;And I don't think you can fault the developers for design decisions they didn't even make.
---
This is why it's a big deal, because you can fault management for not keeping proper documentation, having proper code mantainance, and training cycles for this massive amount of new blood and high level devs leaving. This cycle is how you get the current state of the company, where they can't or won't touch legacy systems because there's no one left around that understands them, and previous management didn't properly force documentation of it.
---
Oh, fuck off Jessica
---
I'm gw2 the player base doesn't mature. It quits.
---
For salt on the wound. Bring another player. You get a buff. Makes the achievement trivial
---
If Anet were willing to listen to criticism before it explodes into poor reception every time there's drama, they could safely avoid pitfalls like these.
---
Instead, any negative feedback is locked down, quarantined and removed from the forums. Critics are suspended or banned and we get sub-par releases.
---
Anet's insular culture is a relic of the pre-community driven game environment, and they show no signs of wanting to change that.
---
Sure to the non-gaming subculture it’s cringe but this is reddit and a GW2 subreddit.  People are going to do what they want and enjoy doing.  Almost equivalent of wearing a professional sports team shirt.
---
Sounds about right. I've seen the mount effect in action, too.
---
Every game you mentioned took the criticism to heart and worked on it, likely because of outcry and losing many players.
---
Gw2 lost tons of players, but shows little signs of actually taking criticism to heart. Alliances is a good example.
---
Ffxiv had a trash launch, to the point of needing a rework and relaunch... which succeeded because they were willing to make changes and improved the game vastly.
---
Communication and actually providing a good product, two things anet isnt capable of or interested in nowadays.
---
Frodo was taken.
---
Change = bad
---
Right? RIGHT!?
---
Dont worry despite being complex it will fail spectacularly. After all, if anet doesnt get the details of their complex system right it wont do much good.
---
And the only details anet understands is lore RP references. Their understanding of wvw doesnt even get to details...
---
Just play a elemental mage. They're pretty resistant to change.
---
They dont design classes to fit a dozen roles anymore. At least not from a numerical pov.
---
Salt.
---
I got Vision back when the reward was bugged and you didn't need to complete achievement. Still haven't done a couple of them. If you have a time machine, you could try that.
---
&gt; but shows little signs of actually taking criticism to heart
---
This statement is ridiculous, and people very often seem to "conveniently" forget that Anet does listen to the players and make conveniency updates. We most certainly didn't have an account wardrobe before, and back in the days, it did cost money to repair your gear. There was no "use all" option on item stacks...and if you go through all the updates throughout the years, you'll find dozens and dozens more examples.
---
No community manager is better than gaile actively suppressing everyone with criticism. Which clearly had a polarizing effect on both communication with anet and between certain groups of players / mindset.
---
Forgive me for starting chrono after the nerf bat hit chrono hard, but gravity well/moa signet, pistol and shield still apply heavy CC for the most part. I have no trouble CC bombing at all. So might I inquire what chrono exactly lost (I know that distortion was a staple, but I don't know about the other losses).
---
Huh, I guess me, my whole guild, and all the other randos that have been playing on and off since launch and have been online daily for the past few months didn’t get the memo, when we continued to work on making more legendaries and do fractals, raids, and wvw, helping new players on our down time, and running people through dungeons if they have trouble finding groups for old shit.
---
In other words, just because you got bored being a solo player or pug, just because you saw how time and resource consuming it was to make legendaries, so you decided to give up and quit, doesn’t mean the rest of us have.
---
It's supposed to be a funny meme, sir, not actual criticism to the game :)
---
Well it's making fun of someone having a stroke, even if the situation is quite absurd because this person happens to be James Bond. For people who have been through this, the experience of their brain suddenly not working can be incredibly scary.
---
Luckily power chrono is one of the best classes for that, it gives itself high fury uptime, usually perma 25 might, and is the only class with both quickness and alacrity, so it should be best off among the open world builds as far as boons go :)
---
&gt; share tagging via venom
---
Does this mean if I give someone else venom, I get credit for their tags?
---
no u
---
&gt; but now you dont have agony in most fractals anymore
---
Haven't played fractals in over a year, what do you mean by that?
---
The wurm is in the passage between Bay and the camp north of it.
---
the mmo communities like to complain a lot. I try to enjoy the game and have fun and not take it too serious, since its, you know, a game.
---
yeah well, you will have perma swiftness also, right traited
---
&gt; i dont understand the downvotes. This is a legitimate question and the video actually show clearly the issue. It cant be asked more.
---
because your exposing a problem that many people refuse to admit that exists, because THEY are playing it
---
that sure aint gonna win you any good will from them
---
They removed the cap on phantasms. All phantasms turn into clones after doing their attack but you can have any number of them at a time. Once they are done they turn into clones which you can only have a maximum of 3 at once. To go along with the change all phantasm skills were buffed have a much bigger impact now along with the mirage elite spec making use of them for their attacks. Tanking is only really a thing in raids and chronomancer is great at it, they have a lot of blocks, evades, and invuls to avoid damage all together. The most recent balance patch on the 1st changed the trait Seize the Moment which may end up changing all the meta builds but [this is the current meta boon chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) in raids. You can see a [nice example of the rotation here](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) (general rotation is the same even though the video is now outdated). For unlocking the elite specialization you want to do the hero points in the expansion maps worth 10 points each. "HP trains" in LFG are groups that run around getting these points. The hero points in Path of fire can be done solo or in small groups but some of the fights in HoT are intended for 3-5 players and will be very difficult to solo. There are still many hero points that involve no fighting at all though so you can always do them.
---
There are so many things to be said here. 
---
First of all chrono doesn't carry at all, imo. It gives you alacrity and quickness which, again imo, are the boons which make playing a dps and doing its rotation the best (as in, the class feels smoother, not carried). Other boons are just mandatory to reach crit cap/do more damage/sinergy with your class (retal for guard for example). Everything else usually falls under the role of a healer. 
---
Now, healbrand. It can carry, yes (especially a very good one), but it doesn't carry everybody in my opinion. Having perma retal/aegis/protection doesn't make you invulnerable to mechanics; since I pug with no KP whatsoever and haven't been doing T4s for long I have run with healbrand and some people have died anyway because they fail certain mechanics, especially with bad instab (the healbrand is also a pug and can not be that good). When you're knowledgeable about mechanics and can dps decently that's when the carry kicks in. At that point, though, a lot of people switch to no healer compositions (quickbrand/rev). 
---
I also see pug groups asking for a healer when there are not very nice instabilities but not when there are others. In that case people mostly just want to do dailies without wiping/failing to be as quick as possible. 
---
As others have also said, some people like to play support (I play it too), so it's nice to have the option to do that in the gamemode you like/want to play. 
---
So if you feel like you are being carried by your support, change support. You can even open your own lfg "dps only" (again, why would somebody play without quickness/alacrity....). As others said, you can raise the difficulty by doing CMs or raids. Or just join chrono/druid comps (less carry potential imo).
---
We don't appreciate them either.

Yes, tons of content for new and returning players and still no subscription fee. Maybe you'll find [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here) useful as you're starting out. Was there anything specifically you were having trouble with? It can always help to seek out other people to play with or join a guild too.
---
I was originally running a chrono build with double staff that seemed interesting ([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage\_-\_Staff/Staff\_Infinite\_Horizon](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Staff/Staff_Infinite_Horizon)). Relied on spamming illusions and letting them deal damage at range while you run around not getting focused. Seemed really slow to kill stuff, though (I have no ascended gear so maybe I just don't do a lot of damage?). I decided to finish off getting HP for Mirage and unlocked it to get the Axe build ([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage\_-\_Axe/x\_Infinite\_Horizon](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Axe/x_Infinite_Horizon)). Still not doing a ton of damage and I feel like I'm focused a bit more often. Trying to work out when to shatter and managing energy for dodges and actually getting the axes to fire off. I feel a bit button spammy with no real direction but I guess that's part of learning.
---
I know they are condi builds and the goal is to stack and let the ticks burn down the enemy so I'm not upset about it. Plus I'm finding it actually fun to play compared to my Daredevil/Deadeye I've mained for storyline content.
---
Honestly a lot of the times the oversights are incredibly obvious and are one of the first things the community questions.
---
500 cooking and the home instance gathering malarky was a perfect example of this.
---
Gw2 Dev: We are working on x y and z  
---
Fo76: We will pass this to teh dev team.
---
That said Fo76 has a roadmap that they are roughly following
---
They added it a while back, along with a red telegraph for enemies when you activate you're abilitys. All F abilities besides the f1 activate a second or so after you hit them. 
---
 It annoyed me in PvE because I was used to the old reaction time for cleanses and to adjust I had to pre-use my f2 for certain abilities like before Soul Split on Dhuum.
---
I have found the opposite to be true. Usually the opposing team kills ,and only rarely do they hold off
---
Thats why they teach new ppl how to work with their code. Thats stated in several interviews with devs over the years.
---
I think Bobby Stein is the only one from Prophecies' days left. Linsey Murdock is still working there though, and she had a lot of influence in GW1 (esp. War in Kryta). Joe Kimmes, a programmer from the Live Team (post-EotN content) is still there too, I believe.
---
Seven developers followed Mike O'Brien's departure to establish [https://mana.works/](https://mana.works/) (not to be confused with [https://www.manaworks.com/](https://www.manaworks.com/)). See r/ManaWorks subreddit.
---
They reworked the final mission, it used to be designed basically as a 5 man dungeon and not intended to be run solo. That is no longer the case and you can now run the final mission solo just fine.
---
&gt;I played a Norn Guardian
---
The guardian profession mechanic is their virtues. They actually have very low base health but gain burning, healing, and blocks (aegis) for free periodically and can activate the virtue to gain it on demand. In end game PvE guardians can become Dragonhunters that deal heavy damage any lay down traps or Firebrands that can give quickness, heal, or do lots of condition damage in the form of burning. Both elite specs change your virtues and give access to a new weapon and new type of skill (longbow and axe with traps and mantras respectively).
---
&gt; they can also heal
---
Healers are only really a thing in end game PvE but almost every profession can be run as a healer, some are better in certain situations or game modes but there are viable options.
---
&gt;I made was a Charr Ranger. Are they any good?
---
Rangers can be druids which are the best raid healers or they can be soulbeasts that merge with their pets. Soulbeasts have good power and condition damage builds.
---
&gt; also, what's with all this controversy about the company?
---
Which controversy? There are currently people concerned with the upcoming build templates and before that the direction of future content but are you referring to something specific?
---
I agree with you on all of that. It just seems sad and desperate that you'd go actively looking for especially easy to kill noobs. Is that really something that brings you joy?
---
Few points - as I understand we are talking about people who constantly tag keep and ambush players that are trying to leave it, right? That for me is clearly a distraction tactic meant to help their zerg (also - some people like playing non-zerg classes but don't like being constantly hated and kicked out of every zerg).
---
Second - WvW is a grand massive open world PvP, isn't it? It's not a free-for-all type, but three teams all fighting each other with complete freedom of movement on a single map sounds like big open PvP for me. It's more or less the core of this mode.
---
Where can I learn how to draw like that ;-;
---
Three signets are what most one shot builds take. Shadows for vuln, assassin for power, infiltrators to get close. Infiltrators is pretty much required for core and DD one shot builds, just cause you won't have enough stealth to get around. Even DE builds take it. It's far from a useless signet.
---
I don't even know what the hell you are saying on the second one. Agility is a cleanse, if you don't see it, they don't have a cleanse. Either they used it, or don't have it. If you don't see it, condis will probably kill the thief.
---
Next time you quote me, actually quote me, rather than half ass paraphrase things.
---
Ah, fair point. I'm only playing one character for the most part, so that didn't even appear on my radar.
---
wait, i cant get them anymore in HoT areas? I logged out in one and as such logged back into one. But i always remembered getting them from leveling up and certain other activities like map completion and the like? (for the record, i got 3 birthday gifts in the mail when i logged on :p)
---
No worries, I used to hate WvW too, frankly for the same reasons.
---
This is probably why I defend it now - those are the same arguments I had before.
---
Leveling up when capped out gets you [spirit shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_Shard) which function how the old extra skill points did. By just getting to 80 you'll unlock all your skills and traits now and any extra hero points you got through the maps are kept as a bonus. If you own the expansions ([$20 for both expansions here](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807), HoT comes with PoF now) you gain access to the elite specializations which take up one of your normal specialization slots and modify the professions. For example the druid elite spec for ranger turns it into an amazing healer or the chronomancer spec for mesmer allows it to provide party wide consistent quickness and alacrity. Each elite spec requires 250 points to fully unlock, the points you got while leveling on the maps give 1 each but the expansion maps' hero points all give 10 points each so it's rather easy to unlock them by doing the challenges there. I also have [a guide I'm working on here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here) that goes over a lot of basic info and has links to other resources at the top including other guides.
---
So what is content then? A fractal is no longer content once the newest one drop? A meta is not content if not on the latest map?
---
Use the LFG.
---
Took a 3 year break, came baxk a few weeks ago. What happened to lootstick? Was actually planning on doing it for the halloween trains  :(
---
It would also help if they aren't so secretive about everything they do. They hide all their work, while some of it doesn't need to be a secret at all. Every single thing is played off as special while we - the player - don't need 'only special'. We just like to be involved.
---
&gt; As a glasscannon thief I can just face tank pretty much 80% of encounters. 
---
Could you take a video of this? I run CMs + T4s every day with my warrior or alacren and I don't have this experience.
---
This seems to be the best fit. Thanks
---
Glad it got better for you, I couldn't find enjoyment in it or reason to play. 
---
On the contrary, I had a friend who was not into pvp at all and not a hardcore gamer by any means (or even any good at gw2 mechanics, pretty bad actually) but he tried wvw as his second main ranger (his elementalist failed super hard even in core pve) and he loved it, but when I thought about it I wasn't even surprised as he played such an easy class spamming ranged autos, and apparently his new group/commander loved him. 
---
Meanwhile, I was trying to do... things.. with my Mesmer, like I do them in fractals or spvp where Mesmer has a very specific and delicate role, I just couldn't find a purpose for myself what exactly should I be doing in wvw, and any ganks completely threw me off my rhytm trying to sink into the game mode.
---
Is there a way to keep key binding different for each character without having to swap them around all the time?
---
Power DPS is in a strong state in a lot of the game.
---
You can get them in the HoT and PoFareas. You wander any of the newer maps and there’s plenty of them, each gives you 10 HP as well, instead of just 1 like the base game maps do.
---
&gt; No man's Sky is also a very good example of that.
---
No Man's Sky is a perfect example, the gutless PoS released a steaming pile of garbage and then ghosted the players with zero communication for months, to the point even the mods for the no mans sky subreddit started talking of closing it down entirely. Have they since improved the game? I hear people talking positive things from time to time, but I honestly don't give a rat's hairy butthole, I'm not giving the game or the piece of trash responsible another chance at this point. So yeah first impressions and the weeks immediately following have a huge impact on your relationship with your players.
---
Maybe it's not just the healer that's carrying you, but the other 3 players as well.
---
agreed OP, even if the Whiteknights downvote the truth.
---
Go and summon that one archer.
---
I will man, I will..
---
It is content, but it's not new content. But since we can only do it only like a couple of weeks a year, it feels good. Yes I wish we could have new additions but oh well...
---
I once had a pet that ibernated 6 months each year, so each year when appeared was like a new pet. This is the same.
---
"he seemed more content, less bitter"
---
hmm this isn't going to well for Anet losing 7 people.
---
I bought the original GW2 at launch, never really gotten to play it. Have played randomly every since, max character is lvl 50.
---
My question now is, if I would return properly, should I buy all the expansions and then start playing our the other way around?
---
Don't just stare at it...
---
Guard staff auto was changed to a chain attack. No longer a cone aoe.
---
The story is really good now, it's what keeps me coming back. I know a bunch of people left for games like FFXIV and come back cos they're shit.
---
Listening to feedback and applying solutions are two very different things. They can't just always directly take peoples feedback and implement a solution exactly as "one dude on reddit" suggested. There are dozens of factor like coding, marketing, priority lists and what have you that. 
---
&gt; Did they listen to desert bl feedback? Pvp feedback? Feedback after wvw tournies? Feedback of wvw mounts and their implementation? Feedback on certain raids and encounter design? 
---
They listened to desert bl feedback, yes. They re-implemented alpine borderlands as the main wvw maps(without the water, as well), and then changed it so that both borderlands types would be used.
---
WvW mounts is also a prime example of a "you can't please everyone". They've done multiple major changes to them after implementing them just to figure out what the general populi agrees with, and whether these things worked in the grand scale of things is just something you can't simulate in-house, they don't have the testing manpower for that. 
---
I do not see the claims you're making here that they are only listening to "casual" players for feedback, not at all.
---
Feedback on raid designs/encounters is being used as well, as far as I see it. You don't see the kind of mechanic bypassing shenanigans that happened on Gorseval in raid wings after the first one, for example. I can also point you to a very specific example where I made a topic on reddit asking why Deimos was still applying perma-revealed in his boss battle(something that makes Deadeye builds particular useless), where a dev responded to and fixed it 2-3 weeks afterwards.
---
No I just play a daily match of PvP for the Avenger title, some rewards and sometimes to complete the daily missions. So it the PvP achievements are slow
---
I don’t think they’d allow the politics to enter into game development. The “Free Hong Kong” stuff wouldn’t go over well with some people.
---
Tell that to Mario Kart and Forza.
---
Well, it *is* content by definition.
---
I like to hold my choya balloon while I wait there as a sign that I am not looking for a fight.

If you run 2 healers especially 1 healscourge you will facetank everything again.
---
I'm no troll, I just haven't had time to check the blog much recently. Thought I'd just ask since I knew people here would have the answer.
---
Another "I just came back recently post" but I really need some help with this:
---
I used to main chrono and it's preetty much my only class geared for fractals/raids and the only thing I know how to play in endgame pve. It was awesome while it was meta, you always got a welcoming groups everyone wanted a chrono. And now we are useless?
---
Not to even mention all the time, investment and effort into mastering what was said to be one of the hardest pve roles in the game, all of it being completely wasted and pointless now, I just want to know what do I do and where do I go from here? If I just want to do my daily fractals, at the very least? No groups are looking for chrono and I don't even see any mesmers in open lfg groups either, it's like the class is literally dead. 
---
I got full viper gear for mirage, I tried the class, but it's not to my liking. I either played support chrono or dps phantasm build, and both of those seemed better and more fun than what mirage is offering to me, or maybe I'm not getting the mirage (it seems much weaker in open world too). 
---
What do I do and also how do you get around with our F4 (distortion) removed? Should I just delete the character in absolute despair? It's the only class I properly mained, and ever cared for in this game, and seeing it ruined like this and being kicked out of meta completely devastates me.
---
Nice
---
No one outside the game would know what it is and just think it's a graphic i don't see the cringe
---
&gt; The good Asuras are called Adityas and are led by Varuna, while the malevolent ones are called Danavas and are led by Vritra.
---
Malevolent ones are called Inquest
---
Well...  run the farm, but don’t spend ALL DAY in there running around in circles and running away from Steve.
---
i guess everything is not content
---
That poor table!!
---
Um...no, that would be a very bad idea.
---
Well, if you really like to draw then maybe an art school? I have a graduate degree in graphic art. Also, online tutorials and a lot *A LOT* of practice.
---
&gt; I would be happier if they had just given me an extra inventory with 50 shared slots usable only for novelties
---
As a fan of MMORPGs in general, I think "limited bag space" is a legacy of the past, and should disappear, unless the game wants to implement a **realistic** "encumbrance" system, were the weight of items matters as much as their volume.
---
&gt;the PvP achievements are a slow grind. 
---
I once gave PvP a try. I didn't really enjoy it, but I persevered, figuring I need to at least give it more than a fleeting chance before I give up with it altogether. Eventually I gave up. That was a few years ago. Ever since then, Temple Slayer: 14/15 has been in my top 3 almost consistently, sometimes taking the top spot. I did go back once to try and clear it off, but after a few games, none of them were in 'Temple of the Silent Storm', then another, similar achievement started creeping into the top 3 and I just gave up with it altogether. I really wish we could hide achievements :-/
---
Dayum. U on EU or US?
---
Ah, I see. Guess I'm a bit more fucked there, heh.

capatalizing on a serious situation like HK protests will always come of as scummy and will never go over well with most ppl.
---
also concerning riot, they released a statement where they clarified that they didn't order their casters to censor HK
---
The guild wars were a historical event in GW1. What we had was GvG.
---
PvE ~= WvW, PvP ~= WvW
---
They're so different that your comparison holds absolutely no water.
---
I’ve seen my share. With knowledge loss and the onboarding of new devs it’s not too uncommon for it to be completely rebuilt. However for a large organization of Anets size I’d really hope their documentation is properly kept. You can’t do that with a legacy product like a video game.
---
&gt; Is that really something that brings you joy?
---
killing enemies is often a daily too and it's also a long term goal.
---
people will try to get their kills when/where they can.
---
Yeah, guild mate complains he doesn't see the diacritic variants of letters when I'm typing these - he does use different chat font size
---
You are heavily brainwashed by male supremacists to believe that gender oppression did not exist in Jessica’s case. 
---
A woman was labeled as an evil witch, received overwhelming harassment and lost her job. For what crime? Just because women should not have freedom of speech? Just because she expressed her dislikes to a male stalker outside of work time and told him to get the F out of her personal space? It is way worse than firing someone for provoking with political views when it was in breach of the work agreement.
---
The whole thing was personal between two people until the dude cried like a victim and brought in thousands of misogynists to help him assault female developers and gamers. 
---
You don’t deserve saying the word “equality” when you are part of the problem destroying human rights.

But then you get sent back and restart. It's a time loop, thus a circle.

Art by [Grinnu](https://mobile.twitter.com/Grinnu_)
---
hm?  purple\_miku?  I remember you posting on the GW2 forums regularly.  You were a fantastic mesmer player from what I remember.
---
But yea my experience has been similar to yours and the other poster.  Half the people play the game and are amazed by how different it is, the freedom, the world, the classes.
---
The other half think the story is trash and everything is easy to the point of annoyance, no builds, tanking and healing being worthless.  Once they found difficult content they were excited, until they realized it was just stacking and dpsing.  Many went back to WoW (which ive built my new home in as well).  shame.  ill always love gw2, but yea
---
Yeah, it’s meta for bringing stability to the squad.
---
I remember one time waiting for the Harpy to spawn at Redwater, and I saw a player approaching from North.  They were on a core engy, and I could see from their nameplate they didn't have access to the warclaw, and they were running to grab the Vista on the bridge.
---
I figured this must have been a new player, and they just ran up and stood in the corner next to a firefly.
---
I just couldn't for a second think of attacking, and I just went back and forth patrolling for the harpy.  I was a bit concerned when a fellow player showed up, that they would attack the engy, but they also just gave that person a bye.
---
Once the harpy spawned, I even took care to not hit the enemy Engy with AoE, and in the end we all went home with our daily.
---
I'll fight tooth and claw in the game mode, but it's just a game, we're all people, and nothing is served by attacking someone who likely won't be able to put up an even fight.
---
Now of course this person might have been on an alt account and been a Top 25 sPvP player who would have roflstomped me...but somehow I doubt such a player would just camp a firefly waiting for a daily.
---
yup . most ppl recommend to open them on lvl 49-53.

Sorry to hear that.  When you find a troll just block and move on, don't let it affect the way you play or not help others.

Unless I missed a new development, Frosty isn't gone.

Maze running is the closest to 'farming gold' I've ever done in this game.
---
I didn't do Istan
---
I only did the Doric farm a few times, and/or when I wanted easy access to the POI for map completion
---
SW and Dragonfall I do for fun, not gold per hour.
---
Usually I also only run the maze for maybe 45mins at a time.
---
Content?  No.  Easy way to earn gold to buy gems for skins? Yep.
---
Serious question, I never played during halloween, how does this labyrinth farm work?

An interaction I’ve always enjoyed is when capping a spot and you see a team mate running to get credit, stepping out of the ring and letting them get in before it pops.

Fractals get a lot better when you get to T4, at that point everybody knows what they're doing and you'll probably find yourself carried most of the time - opposite of what was the norm in T2/T3 :) it becomes much "easier" as your teammates don't suck anymore, know the mechanics very well, have proper builds and gear and so on. T3 is probably the hardest part you have to grind trough fractals as solo, as you wil lliterally have to carry most of the time, while also learning the mechanics yourself at the same time - it can get pretty gross at times. But all becomes worth it once you reach T4.
---
did you ever see the guild wars 2 commercial when the game came out?
---
no marketing is worse than that
---
Also to add to your list, 
---
for WvW: http://builds.vabbi.org/ 
---
for PvP: https://www.godsofpvp.net/
---
he already played years ago
---
Most sites have builds that are meant for group content like raids and fractal, they can be used in an open world and story but if you struggle with that you will maybe need something with more survivability. 
---
Maybe look at WP series about builds, he is focusing on builds that make content easy to play and video can be better than just some traits and gear but on other hand, wp videos can be long:
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv
---
Same for core DD thief builds. All you do is proc your signet on cooldown and auto-attack, preferably from behind.
---
The title of this should be "...just to see all their effort ruined because we're all hyper critical entitled fucking super nerds"
---
Jesus fuck, what exaggerated baby bitch bullshit. It's not even that I disagree with the criticism of the systems, but are you fucking serious they "ruined novelties"?
---
A lot of these are the kind of people who will try to "fight" you as long as they are 2-3vs1 (or 4-5 vs 2, etc, etc). Come at them with same or close-to-same numbers and they will run with their life: they dont wanna fight, they only want easy ganks.
---
Yes, and more should. It would be easy to blame other players rather than those who control the game, but their marketing team studies and predicts customer behavior to figure out how best to make money off of us. Anet's out-of-touch business tactics toward pedestrians on the Internet are what need to calm the fuck down.

yeah, i have just read in one of his updates that he did mention it himself on the ticket, so well, he can only ask for mercy. But in any case i can still reaffirm that the original banning was for being marked as a possible stolen account due to multiple IP adresses and failed transactions.
---
I can see why.
---
That is absolutely  market suicide for an MMO. Especially one with a market in mainland China. 
---
Will never happen.
---
&gt; People should be able to fight you if they want,
---
They've been able to do it for 7 years - pick a couple builds that excels at quickly putting down a single person in the field or cheesing out if things somehow happen to go south.
---
Then ANet added Warclaw specifically because they wanted to encourage people who didn't like ganking to return to the mode. And I started doing WvW dailies again, occasionally getting a couple objectives for the server since I was there already anyway.
---
But the ~~gankers~~ "roamers" kept complaining, and ANet caved in. It's their right, of course - but it just means I'm no longer interested in participating in all this again, and the WvWers can go back to complaining about how there isn't enough people playing their mode.
---
Yeah, I don't get why people wet their pants about this but to each their own.
---
Invalid argument. The circles are highly different, doable with a lot more playable races and elite specs, there are different types of running AND you also have tracks where you run from A to B. 
---
Forza has a lot more to offer than running in circles.
---
That's how stealthy classes are played, it would be the same with rogues in WoW.
---
So you didn't even try, great job. You surely didn't give them a fight, but 100% they had a good laugh.
---
the fact that the circle shows outside of the branch on the right side really bothers me. aaarrgh!
---
In what Universe do you live in where only liberals care about mainland China expanding their sphere of influence?
---
Looks fine to me, to each his own i guess
---
[EXPLAIN THIS THEN](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2b5347d11c4fc0d9346a5db5ee4a6aba/tumblr_pkk52pYdMM1v8aiumo1_640.png)
---
nope, i don't mean it this way.
---
What i don't know is if anet will change this current chili only reward track to contain half chili and half the next currency or if the next episode will have it's own currency repeatable reward track. If we knew for sure that anet was going to use the 1st method it would make sense to hoard the final reward chests without opening because their content could be updated, but if they use the second way there's no need to hold back.
---
But that is the thing, it is still content it just not content YOU play.
---
Saying that it isn't would mean that it doesn't exist, that might be the case for you but that doesn't mean it isn't in the game.
---
It still doesnt change my original point. I understand people in gank squads with cancer builds are a pain, but people *should* be able to fight you in a pvp based gamemode. Regardless of whether or not you're outnumbered.
---
&gt; fight
---
"Fight" as a scrub 1v2 against people in leggies with meta hair, suuure. That's the exciting challenge they want from me, right?
---
&gt; attract furries   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; birds won't have the same impact 
---
Eh? Do you think furries are limited to cats?
---
Your mount in this pvp mode has 3 dodges.
---
Why exactly do you think anyone cares about your conclusions?
---
This reminds me of doing Obsidian Sanctum JP alone in wvw . I thought for sure I would end up trolled and/or ganked. But no, we turned in to a group with ppl from all sides doing it together. Some even went back to guide “the enemy” every now and then if they fell behind. Very wholesome :)
---
&gt; but 100% they had a good laugh.
---
Oh, I'm sure that's nothing new for them. One more, one less.
---
&gt;ANet added Warclaw specifically because they wanted to encourage people who didn't like ganking to return to the mode.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure making a quick buck from WvWers by hastily shitting out an untested mount with a 2k gem palette swap pack was definitely *not* ANet's goal.
---
MKL?
---
&gt;What is content then? 
---
It's quite obvious by context that the OP means in the literal sense "running in circles is not good content". No reason to get pedantic.
---
I never said it was only liberals who care about the current China situation.
---
Lmao wtf is this communities logic man
---
&gt;But the ~~gankers~~ "roamers" kept complaining
---
To be fair it can sometimes also help the "nice/decent" roamers catch the gankers because without the spear there is not much to do about a ganker running away if you are not on the right class/build and it was getting very frustrating to see everybody run away from you (even in same number situations) if they didn't feel like it without much room to force a fight or to not know how you could engage a fight on mounts because the 1st person to dismount started with a pretty big disadvantage.
---
I was able to get a new executioner axe from that one npc standing at the right of the TP guy at terrace pass. worked with other costume brawl weapons as well. no idea about musical stuff tho.
---
so I have one axe stored in novelties and another to use it faster by just clicking in the inventory.
---
Do they drop just regular items, or is this some sort of farm specific to Halloween items, or?
---
Ah yes... wish I could go back to 5 months ago :)
---
This is what I do in WvW when roaming alone. I'm not very good at fighting players alone.
---
If escape or fight is not possible, I just stay still and let them kill. At least they get some loot, so technically it's helping other players.
---
&gt; running in circles is not good content"
---
Only that there is "running in circles in not content" there is no word "good here.
---
And therefore my point still applies here.
---
the good 'ol days.
---
This is what I am referring to when I say there is no reason to be pedantic.
---
It's kinda what they are pointing out though, that with the lance gank groups are now back to the "difficult to avoid/dodge" depending on where you are on the map and that the edge they actually gained with the introduction of the Warclaw to avoid those feels like it's gone.
---
I had no idea that I could do this, so thank you for posting this!  o.O
---
People still do dungeons?
---
I'm just puzzled we still haven't gotten *at least* a combat tengu tonic after all the other weird ones we've gotten, including Kodan, shadow warrior and so on.
---
I feel like it should have been a given considering the race's popularity.
---
Yes, that much I know.  But the term "share tagging via venom" suggests something different, like anyone I give venom to sharing their tags (with me).  I don't think that is how venom works and I have never heard of "share tagging" before, so that is why I asked about it.
---
What kind of a pet is that?
---
WeirdChamp
---
&gt; "I've been attacked in pvp mode, wah wah"
---
"I've faced specifically what this mount was designed against when it was originally released."
---
yeah?! despite popular believe they are not dead. Everyone is just too afraid to list their LFG and then comes to reddit to complain that dungeons are dead.
---
You have two legendary trinkets.
---
&gt;They've been able to do it for 7 years - pick a couple builds that excels at quickly putting down a single person in the field or cheesing out if things somehow happen to go south.
---
Those are just the traits of dueling builds. They're not more expensive to make or anything, but you cant just expect to bring a pve build into wvw and go toe to toe with everyone else. Nothings stopping you from changing your own build to duel others.
---
&gt;Then ANet added Warclaw specifically because they wanted to encourage people who didn't like ganking to return to the mode.
---
Source? 
---
&gt;But the ~~gankers~~ "roamers" kept complaining, and ANet caved in. It's their right, of course - but it just means I'm no longer interested in participating in all this again, and the WvWers can go back to complaining about how there isn't enough people playing their mode.
---
It doesn't sound like you were really participating in the gamemode in the first place. There are more than enough people who log on to wvw to do dailies. You're not doing anyone a huge service by logging on
---
If, by your own definition, you're a scrub, then there's your problem.
---
Mounts aren't a free "skip battles" ticket, even in PvE there's traps and mobs that will attack you so it's pretty normal that in WvW you'll get targeted and dismounted. 
---
You aren't without options, from adapting your build to dodging when attacked to not roaming alone to using the map to your advantage (enemy warclaws are slower in your territory). Ragequitting because you were attacked in a PvP mode is pretty pathetic.
---
Fr though I list on lfg and if I don't have 2 in my party getting a full group takes over an hour at times.
---
i whoud bet,that whole templates were made by one person.
---
It's not even true, you *can* use multiple novelties at the same time through the wardrobe. You can't use a transformation and a chair at the same time, but you can mix and match any other combination of the novelty slots.
---
And they're grouped by how they would have been mutually exclusive in their item forms anyway. Like, you could not have two musical instruments out pre-wardrobe, and that's still true. You could not hold two bundle items at the same time, and that's still true. You could not use two transformation tonics at the same time, and that's still true, etc.
---
But you *can* stack stuff from the 4 non-chair novelty slots together, just like you could in the past. The only difference is that you can't quickly switch between two novelties of the same type anymore, which is not a real problem.
---
Uh
---
birds are very popular in the furry community.
---
This mount was designed for monetization
---
I prefer GW1.... I wish I liked both games. ☹
---
gw2 isnt doing well at all.
---
ESO was the mmo I pegged as going to shut down first, and apparently that games in game population is tremendous across console and pc.  It gets more updates than any other MMO that I see and when I logged in myself I was beyond impressed with all the content.
---
FF14 is obviously doing amazing.
---
Blade &amp; Soul is getting a sequel somehow.
---
BDO I know is huge in korea and caught on in USA even getting a console release
---
Every MMO is stable currently and even showing signs of growth except GW2 and wow. 
---
however wow has a 2 year expansion cycle and is so large when it loses players it doesnt matter
---
You know why they don't do anything for dungeons? Because they were too much work to maintain, that is why we have fractals.
---
If they would add those skins to the Dungeons then they would inadvertently also get less Sales and therefore less money to support further development of the game and they would also shift more attention to a content they don't support anymore.
---
That in turn means that they have to support it again, spent considerable amount of time to either fix the issues the community discovers and make them not trivial again because of power creep or spent even more time to get them up to a standard they have today. All of that time is less time for Fractals, Raids and other areas of the game.
---
You DARE suggest that our Mad King lower himself to being the minion of his minion?
---
I installed it and I got a 25 FPS increase. Thanks so much!
---
Last time I did it I got a group for Catacombs in between popping LFG, going into the Dungeon and reaching the camp where you select the path.
---
&gt; Nothings stopping you from changing your own build to duel others.
---
Except for not wanting to duel others.
---
&gt; Source?
---
Logic:
---
* people have been complaining about getting ganked for ages,
---
* warclaw was released as a fast mount with lotsa evades and anti-gank skills not planned for it.
---
&gt; There are more than enough people who log on to wvw just to do dailies. You're not doing anyone a huge service by flipping a camp or two
---
Oh, then it's good to know that me not being there [won't be a huge loss for WvW](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dflekk/state_of_wvw/).
---
nice.
---
&gt;and 45 quid worth of gold if not less. 
---
Some of us don’t buy our gold m8, we just do the content.
---
&gt;Why I would bother with more of them I've no idea...
---
People are always complaining here about not having any gear progression but often times those same people don’t even have a full set o ascended gear, let alone a single legendary.
---
I too enjoy Halloween butt
---
You don't understand, your pvp rights stops where my dailies begins, you have no right to grieve me!!!! What's that, the camp is important for something? Who cares!
---
Tried to tweak the "config" file as guided. I even get more FPS by changing some numbers in the config because my rigs is very strong :)
---
Those aren't details. Those are fundamental design flaws
---
It's a recurring festival. Nobody said its a content patch.
---
The problem is that the game adds pretty much everything in the gem store. If they added those skins as mystic forge recipes or new items to craft with a 500 profession, material prices would rise again.
---
Currently, it's stupid to need 50k mithril ingots and 35k elder wood for one precursor...
---
There's so many materials without any use such as the HoT lodestones and many more...
---
Before adding more ways to farm them, they should really consider new things to use them first, then implement both together at the very least.
---
Most of these suck  lol.
---
But I'll use this to give my wishes:
---
1. Racial skills overhauled as reputation skills, completing hearts for 《race》 unlocks respective racial points for that race (similar to acquiring hero points, the skills cost heart points)
---
 This means that these skills no longer need to be useless ^(and nerfed into the ground the moment one does become useful) because it gives everyone access to them!) They can add reward tracks to PvP&amp;WvW to complete 《insert race here》 hearts in the open world, and unlock the racial skills as you progress through it. (Repeatable track that gives heart completion scrolls that unlock the hearts on the character you consume them on)
---
Gives another reason to do some world completion.
---
Gives 6 more skills per race (so 30 new skills since you start with your existing race skills unlocked)
---
What is the hexagon referencing?
---
Just do like me man lol 
---

Remember when the Chinese community got all pissy because of Cantha and ANet told them "fuck off, we're not going to replace the Canthan district in Divinity's Reach with a giant hole just because you're whining about it"?
---
Good times.
---
IT is. Repeatable.
---
Maze is now getting the "Dungeons are Dead" treatment. They are both still valuable, just ppl overfarmed them, are burned out, and now complain about it.
---
Some normal items drop, but the main draw is Trick or Treat Bags, the Hallowe'en-specific loot bag that drops pretty frequently in the Labyrinth, and less frequently everywhere else in the world.
---
It's especially lucrative at the start, when some players are buying thousands of bags on the Trading Post to establish drop rates, and the price spikes as a result.  They'll slowly get cheaper and cheaper over the festival's course.
---
Same situation in the fractals. God Dessa is annoying.
---
You are right, I now see the confusion it could bring. Would be neat though, sharing tags.  
---
Only way to tag is to do damage.
---
ANET does not talk about problems. \*Laughs in squished charr into chair.\*
---
As I said in another comment: make them reputation skills, so everyone can unlock the norn bear skills. Were the fuckin commander, we can use all kinds of magic, why not give racial magic too.
---
Taimi studied with Charr, Scarlett studied with Hylek, Charr &amp; Asura, why can't we, the chosen commander of the PvE world.
---
(Just disable all racial skills in WvW for ease of balance)
---
They need for Sagas to be there answer to the situation. They also need more pvp maps, and need to stream and promote there own game and work on a roadmap or they might as well get prepared for more lay offs. I want to add a positive note (Strikes are an excellent idea). They need to do more of them. They need both small pve encounters, raids, small scale pvp, and large scale pvp.
---
Sorry, a circle has more edges than any regular finite *n*-gon, certainly more than the 6-gon. A circle is what you get when you take a regular polygon and allow the number of sides to grow without bound, so a circle has literally infinite edge.
---
The problem isn't profits to sustain the game because God knows they already make a good profit. Considering they charged 60$ US for all three games at launch. The gem store exists as well with the ability to convert gems into gold and I know alot of players utilize this option. They are also part of a bigger company that makes a majority of it's money from phone games in Korea.
---
Not alot of people spend gems to buy keys in hopes of getting that ticket/10 ticket scraps so they can use it on a skin. And I've also heard the argument that you should just farm for keys but again there's a small chance of getting scraps to begin with. 
---
Dungeons are completed content though. The only maintenance needed for working released content is bug fixes here and there but nothing too impossible. It's not likely that it will take development time away from anything else.
---
I'm not asking for an overhaul on dungeons, I'm just saying that if there was more of a reason to return to previous content/areas then you'd see alot more people running around doing everything
---
I mean, look at any type of "competitive" player and think what their motivation is. Then see what percentage of them actually believe in sportsmanship (and don't throw a huge fit in the media when some underdog beats them), then make a correction for gamers who're a lot more often very young.
---
Then of course it makes sense that they would push for that type of gameplay since it's so efficient for their goals, as well as desperately protect their right for such gameplay on social media. The only issue for GW2 is that the amount of such "competitive" players in every "competitive" mode is very low... yet those "competitive" players push against changes that would turn the tide as much as they can, as if that will save their modes ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt;Some of us don’t buy our gold m8, we just do the content.
---
That's fair and neither did I. It was just numbers for context. And if I was making another one I would just buy the gold, because "the content" is a mind numbing grind and eff off would I do it again.
---
&gt;People are always complaining here about not having any gear progression but often times those same people don’t even have a full set o ascended gear, let alone a single legendary.
---
Ah yes those imaginary "people". I too like to build a strawman now and then :)
---
But again you bring up legendaries. They are not a gear progression piece.
---
I'd rather have some sort of crowdfunding and turning ArenaNet into a crowdsourced non-profit like Mozilla, or at least making it completely standalone and having some sort of donation system like Patreon.
---
All those who pay get some perks that the rest may not get or take much longer to get, then everything else is in-game rewards.  
---
Not even more gemstore at all.
---
actually good builds aren't being explained because there is no real reason to do it..plus too much effort really
---
it's either obvious stuff(using big damage abilities , take advantage of buffs/build mechanics) or it boils down to math out the numbers
---
you're overcomplicating things! let's look at illusions power chrono, which is what you should play when alone:
---
you open with warden(lower dps) because you wanna spam your higher dps phantasms as much as possible, especially swordsman during CS..you need mirror images so you can CS fast
---
after you run out of that burst(including resets with heal signet) you warden again and blurred frenzy while waiting until you can spam more swordsmen and disenchanters again!
---
f1 and mantra are instant-casts so you just press them while doing other stuff
---
as you can see there isn't any super complicated reasoning behind it, you just mostly prioritize swordsman&gt;disenchanter&gt;warden&gt;blurred frenzy
---
So the lance skill works as intended. That's a good thing, but not that surprising.
---
It's not the community, if it was this post would get upvoted and OP wouldn't get trashed.
---
&gt; Except for not wanting to duel others.
---
That's not how open PvP works.
---
&gt;Ah yes those imaginary "people". I too like to build a strawman now and then :)
---
Oh believe me, they exist. They call themselves “hardcore” and talk about quitting the game **every time** anet does anything at all (or does nothing). I dunno how you could think this is a strawman when they’re all over the sub.
---
&gt; My cooking char has the skill at 477 and I struggle to get the rest, because I doubt it is worth it. I've only done the Charr and Sylvari parts of the quest for the passive abilities and I try to motivate myself to do the rest, 
---
Well, the rest is really easy.  To get Cooking to 500, you just need to complete the Human, Norn and Asura parts of the quest, as each of those gives 10 points of Cooking for free.  This should just involve some running around, minor cooking and contributing some Ascended materials, but in exchange you'll get Cooking 500 and 25+ AP.
---
stop it.
---
youre only making it hurt more

---
As a developer of a completely unrelated application, ultimately what people fail to understand about development is that everything is a compromise. You don't get a feature without some drawbacks, and you can't cater the application to every single user; that's completely impractical.
---
Sometimes things are designed badly, I agree, but often the design is unobtainable, either because of technical limitations or simply lack of time needed to develop what was designed. Sometimes things are missed during the initial phases, or even worse there were no initial phases because of high demand and a change was rushed to quell building troubles.
---
Beyond everything, my "favorite" reason for problems is because business partners push something the development team knows is a bad idea, but they are forced to do it anyway. Who takes the flak? The development team. This has happened to me more times than I can count. I've spent months fighting things I know are bad decisions, only to get told, "Too bad. We want this, so do it," by business partners. I actually got told one time, "Yes, we know that's a better approach. But we want [the users] to have to do this long drawn out process."
---
With a game like GW2, I'd be very surprised if monetization optimizations weren't pushed far beyond everything else. They're also likely the most ensured items to be tested and working, while everything else can blow chunks.
---
I'm curious to know how many items that we think are oversights are actually items that intentionally got sidelined in favor of fleshing out something monetization related. It's not like you can just will a feature into existence, sometimes the features that take the most work are the most simplistic, whether it's because it's more complicated than it looks behind the scenes or simply because the initial architecture was wrong (for various reasons, some not preventable) and as a result a large redesign is needed to get it done. If that feature is not going to generate revenue directly, but some other feature will, I can guarantee you I know which one will get prioritized, because business partners rarely see the big picture.
---
While I would normally agree with you, my dislike of the "X is not content" posts leaves me pretty happy with this instance.
---
&gt; Or I can just not enter the mode anymore
---
There you go. 
---
PS. And pls stop complaining about a gamemode you don't even want to play.
---
Thank you for my latest wikipedia rabbit hole that ate up a significant portion of my workday
---
I sometimes run around in circles in Divinty's Reach with the rollerbeetle just for the sake of it. Also in other maps when they get a nice path with no obstacles that allows you to run at full speed in massive circuits.  
---
Same in games like GTA and Saints Row. Sometimes I would just spend minutes driving following traffic regulations for no reason at all. 
---
In Prototype games and other open world games with a 'fast tank' kind of movement like  Saints Row IV I would sometimes just run in circles around the city trashing everything in my path.
---
I say it is content.
---
The mount races, of course.
---
&gt; EDIT: also, what's with all this controversy about the company?
---
There isn't really controversy about Arenanet.  There are some veteran players who've played for 5-7 years and want there to be more game to play and are annoyed that there currently isn't an expansion pending.  They can be very vocal, because they're very invested.
---
You're a returning player from long ago who hasn't been playing all seven years.  That means there's a wealth of content already waiting for you, lots of things for you to play and experience for the first time and work towards that these veterans have already done.  Their concerns shouldn't affect you as a result.
---
Because when the Mad King returns everything goes full circle.
---
The problem is that 90% of players don't put effort into the game.  Healbrand has a lot of carry potential for players that can only sustain about 10-15k burst DPS.  It carries through utility and makes playing outside a static less horrifying.  I play with friends casually; they're really, really good.  Not amazing speed-clear players, but we could probably drop healbrand tbh. 
---
Fractal Instabilities are not created equally.  Certain instabilities like "Afflicted," "We Bleed Fire" or "Adrenaline Rush," can be very deadly when someone slips up and makes a mistake.  Perhaps playing on the edge like that is fun for you, but an entire team getting punished because you had to pug 1-2 spots and players couldn't perfectly can really suck.  I'd estimate only about 5% of the entire population is comfortable playing without a healer in every challenge mote instability variation.
---
I'm still smirking at the lv69 of guilds
---
If you're working without expansions, than Core Warrior is the strongest core class in the game.  Banners are only used in group content, and even then, only as a support role.  A pure DPS warrior doesn't have to use Banners, and you won't be using them in OW or in story missions.
---
So, you are whiny becaus new player can't beat endgame content on day one?
---
Wow, that's quality shitpost.
---
ok so then it's fake WvWers killing other fake WvWers.. why is one group more sad or desperate than the other?
---
Yeah, I'm a developer myself and you would either need to have a lot of confidence in yourself  or know about the code to make such an assessment. Whatever the case you could apply to arenanet and try to fix them yourself if you think that it would be that easy.
---
Which probably won't happen since you will work on other things than this.

Basically you run full beserkers with either fireworks, pack, or summon runes (scholar is fine too) and auto the hell out of things with Shiro/Khala. The video is fairly long but it’s very detailed and is part of a larger series of open world builds

Guardian is the best allrounder. Top gear Power, Condi and Support. Guardian is the swiss army knife of all heavy armors
---
There is a simply way they can fix this error. Anet could make a priority chart like what Runescape 3 did at Runefest last week, which ended up being the roadmap that will last them until fall 2020. All Anet needs to do is november icebrood saga part 1, december pvp refresh new arena and pvp update, Feburary 2020 new raid boss. I mean these are just examples.
---
seems like everything in that list is stuff that new players have no reason to concern themselves with.
---
True WvWera care about the quality of the fights, not the lootbags.
---
If you like an easy playstyle, pick warrior. There are almost no conditional situations for it. It only does two things: Power DPS and Condi DPS.
---
Revenant is the next scale of difficulty. You have to time your aspect swaps when you get low on energy usually. Otherwise, upkeep is your main focus. Revenant can do Power DPS, Condi DPS, and Heal. It is also the only class other than Mesmer that can provide Alacrity.
---
Guardian is the hardest of the three, but as others said, the most flexible. If you want to play a magical warrior or paladin, this is your class. It has Power Burst, Condi DPS, Heal, and Tank. Its non-elite spec build is still viable, which it is the only one of the three with that option.
---
Back in 2013 we had next to zero rewards yet we had so much fun every single night. Each map had 1 - 2 guild groups butchering each other. One of the actual problems that veterans have is that playing the same map for 7 years gets old (the PvE map that was released 4 years ago doesn't count).

Well what I'm suggesting is that you take the objects that are corresponding to the tickets. Insert that object into the part of the code corresponding to the boss's drop rate. They can utilize the code that corresponds with precursor drop rate, tweak the numbers a bit so that it's not a 1/1 mill chance to drop and you have an easy insertion. Again I'm not suggesting they tweak dungeons or overhaul anything. In the code it's just utilizing existing code.

A miniscule operation at best.

A regular organization XIII member. I've made each class as a female Sylvari as well. Jennifer Hale sold me.
---
The WvW community is eating itself. They're actively against features that would change the mode enough to bring new players, and they can't retain old players because it's stale the way it is and it's difficult for ANet to change anything without pissing some of them off, so it's better just to forget about the mode and let it die a natural death with just enough maintenance to still have it on the official list of modes.
---
you're speaking the language of the gods
---
I like runnig.
---
&gt; eventually all new players will have to go through those items.
---
by which time they should no longer be new players.
---
if people rush through everything just to get to endgame asap, of course they'll hit a wall and feel it's not casual enough... because they skipped over the progression.
---
Yes, bringing people that only want to PvE in a PvP mode will fix WvWvW.
---
I imagine it is, I should really PVP sometime lol
---
Yeah only that this team could work on something else except something that eats up too much time. 
---
And actually cutting support was a good management because at some point you have to realize that you spent too much time fixing something without getting any benefit from it.
---
I said they are not dead. Cut support and them still being played are two different things
---
Humans: "nice"  
---
Norn: "good"  
---
Asura: "gratifying"   
---
Sylvari: "delightful"    
---
Charr: "groan"  
---
Tengu: ""
---
You could run into them instead.
---
One can dream.
---
Consumables are not affected by boosters.
---
&gt; I would propose to reduce the requirements to level crafting disciplines from 400 to 500, as what happened with Cooking.
---
Leveling a weaponcrafting profession from 400-500 costs around 65g each, if you use a guide and the armorcrafting professions cost 11g for heavy, 32g for medium and 18g for light.
---
In order to complete the collections for cooking 500, you need plenty of ascended mats and 3 heat stones, which probably make it the most expensive one to level.
---
only very few containers are affected by mf and they will have a hint about it in their tool tip.
---
&gt; Your thoughts arent a source. You can speculate on why they did it all you want, but it doesnt make it true.
---
Same as with other voiced reasons like "monetization", then.
---
&gt; You have no interest in this gamemode. You're just here for dailies.
---
The way WvW is now? Exactly, not interested in it.
---
I used to enjoy the days of WvW tournaments. I had a special character for it, it was fun and I still think that statue we earned was cool. But a lot has changed in both WvW and the rest of the game since then, and PvE is vastly superior for me now for many reasons.
---
When Warclaw came out, I jumped back into WvW and even joined a WvW guild because I thought that changes were coming and the mode was finally catching up to the rest of the game. But no - immediately the nerfs followed and the veterans started complaining, and I just went "eh" and switched to just dailies with occasional objectives. And now that I won't even enjoy those, I'll limit myself to Big Spender and leave those veterans to play with themselves, since that, supposedly, is what they would want anyway.
---
Soooooo...  no reason to use MF boosters while I'm playing sPvP?

Whatever you gotta tell yourself buddy. Keep pretending you were arguing in good faith or that this was even some kinda debate, if it makes you feel like the grown adult you feel like you are on the inside.

Interesting read.

I love the comparison of the judge:

Sure hope they changed things regarding account security!

Arenanet has always been full of idiots and Chris Cleary is one of the biggest ones there. Why is it this way? Because nobody controls these companies and every time their "security officers" speak, people automatically believe. Its not the first time arenanet lied publicly, I hope someone will finally get their asses to the court. Especially the buffons responsible for player data security - because this part doesnt exist in their close minded retarded company.

And for european customers, if you ever believed they are erasing your data after you issue a GDPR demand, you are fooling yourselves.

He was able to give a random guild a hold trim in gailes account. Anet could have restored shit if they truly cared.

Social engineering can be a powerful tool.

warg is the best for civilised cross-server interactions. I always have fun with the dance novelty and jigging down with people who could murder me.
---
My question is why wouldn't Agony Resistance is account-wide instead of per character?
---
"And GW2 has a lot more to offer than running in circles" - Yeah, I know. I played that game for a few hours. Doesn't change the point of the OP. That's completely off topic. It's a fact that mostly any event is the same and the same and the same and the same and the same
---
And now the guy who made bad faith arguments all this time is accusing others of bad faith arguments!

I love this! Tell me more.

I don't know of any guild where the trim wasn't restored? Enlighten us on this?

Ill just address the raid section by saying what you want is already in the game, albeit in a limited form, in fractal CM. Changing all raids to 5 man would be terrible as the class composition for 10 man is already strained due to current PvE balance. Moving to 5 mans would basically mean the current fractal meta would dominate, meaning no more dru/chrono/probably any condi as HP would be toned down to a point where power dominates. Fewer slots just means needing to do more with each slot, meaning fewer things work well.
---
With regard to SR, I am kind of torn. I definitely agree that it is overtuned for normal T4. Plenty of people skip this because they just cant play the game well enough to overcome to constant dodging, need for crowd control, and need for decent DPS. At the same time, it is one of the harder fractals/content in this game and perhaps is what T4 really should be--ie. not the default fractal tier, but actually difficult content that not all groups should steamroll through. I would love if they made a CM in it where the normal mode was tuned down and the CM was slightly tuned up. Though perhaps a good start would be to just adjust certain mechanics; the gusts probably being the most annoying as they are relentless, often overlapping with each other, make stability useless, and sometimes even affect a player mid dodge.
---
You are pathetic.
---
I’m gonna blame people pretending to work. It’s a job, you do it, and people give you money. When you decide to not do your job, and negative things happen as a result, you are to blame. 
---
Maybe they should have more supervision, but id be really surprised if they weren’t fired.
---
I agree, but people still play WvW all the time, so it must have some form of appeal.
---
Nice reply-post.
---
And yet we still get people complaining about how anet won't give them access to their gw2 account because they don't have enough info.
---
**This** is why.
---
The guild I’m in is stuck at lvl 69
---
The only thing this mode has succeeded in is driving scores of players from the game forever.
---
I legit missed your post, sorry about that. It appears that it got downvoted to oblivion, much like this one is.
---
Please tell me you are joking.
---
If they had launched Fallout 76 in 2008,  with everything still exactly the same that was launched in 2018, a normal and sane person couldn't look at that mess of a beta version of a buggy "game" and not feel disappointed.
---
That "shat" couldn't have been considered a game even by 2008 standards. And you know what's funny?
---
They launched it in 2019 without a single hint of shame.!
---
They're supposed to be forces of nature not cute creatures.  With the exception of Aurene, none of them are really supposed to be relatable.
---
&gt; ...the WvWers can go back to complaining about how there isn't enough people playing their mode.
---
Are you really playing if you are just doing your daily?
---
Pumpkins are round
---
Wouldn't work. Costume brawl novelties actively move you in the world, they're not just cosmetic items. Speed movement uses the choya and executioner toys when mounts are disabled but novelties are allowed (Fractals)
---
massivelyop apparently will do any kind of "content" to get views and data from trackers.
---
For master of monuments, the safest spot is the ruins directly south of your garrison waypoint. If you are desert BL, that would be rampart and safer because Desert BL is unpopular.
---
Also on Desert BL, any of the shrines also count, making it easier to get it. The ruins in the desert bl in general are also often ignored. The parts near air keep are also easier if your server owns that area because of windfall, so you can arbitrarily just fall off as needed, even on a mount.
---
Ofc it won't, but you can't say there is more than enough people.
---
I just don't get this peep, I've seen some posts where he's like any other outraging user and suddenly he has others where he pretty much bows down before Anet and sings them praises.
---
It feels like they reused the revenant mace AA chain except it's a sword. The particle effects are cool at least...
---
How much do you want to bet the "security flaw" he found was that he could make the name on his account "Michael O'Brien" or other dev name, or by simply making a fake account using a ghibberish oirgioerhgoiherg@arena.net email?
---
I bet he thinks that alone is enough to give him "Developer access" to the game. 
---
I would suspect no less from a social engineer.
---
The fuck?
---
If this story is true, it's a pretty fucking bad look for Anet and they gave Anet several weeks to respond. Even if it is slightly embelished, the facts that they confirmed for themselves still make Anet look like an amateur hour company. This is a perfectly valid and fine article about a topic I'd want to know about as a consumer, how is this MOP doing "anything for views"?
---
&gt; ...apatheticquitting is fine by me.
---
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. There was def not a hint of this is bull shit or not fun or w/e as you got chased down, dismounted and logged out of a video game. You are just indifferent thats why you made a post about it.
---
Survivability is an interesting question. Out of the three heavy classes I only play dragonhunter in open world, and I find it very difficult to solo champions. 
---
My understanding is that there are very tanky open world builds for warrior and even revenant, so maybe do a search for "bounty solo" builds before deciding on which class to play.
---
You see an enemy player. What do you do?
---
* Fight
---
* Run
---
* Take a screenshot 
---
* Complain on Reddit
---
The third option is the pro option since I can't remember where that button is in the middle of a fight.
---
A bit of Laby farming is fun, but just do as much as you're comfortable with and don't stress too much over missing out on ToT bag drops. I usually do enough to grab the dailies and boss loot, clear a few doors and call it good.
---
I disagree with everything, except the warclaw one. Warclaw is way too big a wall for people to climb to start playing wvw. And we need more people in wvw.
---
I have all 3 and multiple builds...
---
TLDR
---
Warrior is the least fun,
---
Guardian is very all round and useful,
---
Revenant is pure fun
---
&gt; I can't think of many companies who have such a hands on approach to account restorations and the like.
---
Good luck with that on GW1 unless your name is Gaile Gray.
---
Giving access to account after someone told you - its not my account.. emm, no its not about not following overcomplicated guidelines.
---
oh look, bree on it again for exposing some shit about anet. surprise, surprise....
---
&gt;Then you proceeded to swear at me for... presumably having asc. gear (lets just say I have more than one set...) and a leggy. Somehow that's bad now? I've no idea.
---
Lol throughout this whole conversation you’ve been putting words in my mouth like you did right there (seriously, quote where I said that). It must be really hard to live a life here you make things up in your head that never happened and run with it as a matter of fact, and it’s honestly just getting sad at this point.
---
&gt;You are literally frothing at the mouth at this point...
---
Imagine accusing somebody of ad hominem and playing dumb about a comment that is clearly grandstanding (to what audience? Who knows, the audience in your head probably. I mean you do know nobody reads this far into comment chains between two arguing strangers right?) and then saying this. Lol, you’re either trying too hard to troll, or you’re actually mentally deficient.
---
No way he'd even think of doing Guild Wars 2, that game is terrible to stream and that's what he is really looking for.
---
Not saying Guild Wars 2 is a bad game, but pve is boring to watch someone else play and there is so much happening in pvp that anyone watching couldn't follow.
---
Guardian and Revenant are both very flexible. They can both do well with power damage, condition damage, boon support, and healing.
---
Warrior is going to be more or less the same regardless of how you build it. Don't let that deter you from playing it, though. If you like the idea of being a melee CC-heavy damage dealer with tons of mobility and weapon choices, warrior is a great time. Don't worry about Banners, either. They're only really necessary for raiding. Anywhere else, you're free to use whatever utilities you wish.

Recently hit level on my first account 80 for the first time and im enjoying (some) dungeons and fractals at the moment. 
---
1) Im looking for harder content right now, so i understand fractals get harder, any other recommendations? 
---
2) How is the PvP conquest and WvW community? Is it active ect?
---
Thanks guys!
---
&gt;They had a warrant to cart away his PC, laptop, monitors, and USB sticks, all because ArenaNet had filed a criminal complaint against him. 
---
I mean he tried to warn you.. ignoring him for sake of saving money due to cheap personal your hire and THEN raiding his house.. ANet.. please..
---
How can a Rev be easier than a War? Anyway in my case the easiest the better I don't like difficult rotations and multiple swaps (one of the reason I hate the elementalist).
---
Ask your local hamster
---
Definitely get at least LW season 4. All the meta farms and maps in that season have great stuff to get from them. Jump straight to PoF and do the first mission or 2 to get the raptor mount. You can then run over and get the skimmer and bunny mounts to make things a lot easier. Then I’d jump back to HoT for gliders and general story continuity. If you want the flying mounts you need to compete LW season 4 though I believe and they’re much harder to get
---
The dude is a social engineer, otherwise known as a liar by trade. As such, taking everything he says as fact is dangerous. Good to consider the "evidence" he brings to the table, as ArenaNet may or may not have done, but... That's about it. You just can't trust folks like him. 
---
He is really, really good at what he does, and that definitely can lead to him discovering certain security flaws, but they are nothing new to ArenaNet or any other company, and not something that can be fixed fully - all you can hope for is support agents just being more careful, and even then... If a social engineer has enough of your data, that won't matter.
---
Dude, I did the same thing as you but started a month ago!
---
I basically gave up on PvE and remembering what crafting is.  I PvP and WvW now.  Hope this post helps you!  I'll be lurking
---
Well if you only bought POF and HOT, you are missing the living world seasons that build up or transition those stories. You should pick up seasons 2, 3, and 4, and play in this order:
---
- Personal story (assuming you finished this already)
---
- Season 1 (gone, can't replay)
---
- Season 2
---
- Heart of Thorns
---
- Season 3
---
- Path of Fire
---
- Season 4
---
- The Icebrood Saga
---
I mean I feel like they as well as other big content such as them (Races, classes ect) are being held in the "Break glass in case of" container in the back of the office so that they have a method to get people to be sucked back in. (Blizz did this with allied races ,adding some of the most requested races to the game because they KNEW that BFA would suck. They said as much saying they knew it wasn't ready but shoved it out anyway\~)   
---
Best case scenario is they pull them out of the woodwork to plug some holes.
---
Exactly. It’s an evasion tank. Their goal is to dodge around, keeping people busy. If you ignore them, then they aren’t achieving their goal.
---
Except for the fact that we need more WvW players, and going and ganking people who are just trying to complete their dailies (Vet and MoM are two easy ones to get if you don't PvP) just serves to reinforce that there are a lot of jerks in WvW and drives them away.
---
[deleted]
---
What a surprise, someone still defending Anet after all this time. You people deserve them...
---
Well if you want...the patch that introduced the Warclaw was released via patch on March 5th, 2019 at 12:00pm EST.
---
I obtained my Warclaw mount March 5th, 2019 at approx 12:15pm EST.   So from my perspective, 2 days is a lot. 
---
That's neither here nor there.  On March 6th or 7th (can't recall..maybe a few days later??) I posted on the official forums that they need to change how players obtain the mount, as once several months pass and regular WvW players already have it, getting one will be more of a challenge to players new to the game mode.
---
Since that time we've seen vendors introduced to PvE zones that rent out mounts, mainly for events and races. At first it was just Roller Beetles, but now we have vendors who rent out every single PoF mount...and yet nothing has been added to WvW.
---
In all brutal honesty: if this bugs you, best to not introduce friends to WvW. That is the level of (lack-of) support you see in the gamemode.  Best to quit while you're ahead.
---
Is that bad for the game mode? Yep.  But you would think if anyone would know (or care) about this, it would be ANET.  And yet.../shrug
---
It only had the 2 maps and I really only liked the meta event in Silverwastes. Dry Top was one of those maps I never had an interest in going to again after the story/mapping there.
---
There were collections for I think armor and a back piece if that's your thing.
---
The season had some interesting instances, but most of the instances were "meh" for the most part. The overall story does sort of act as a prologue to Heart of Thorns though, so at least on the story front, I think it is totally worth it to play. But there's definitely some cringey AF dialogue :P
---
A bit self centered there?
---
Thank you, I definitely planned on getting to tht mounts faster. They seem so fun and useful.
---
Well i really want the beetle mount i saw it in game and absolutely loved it. But since its in LW season 4  and i don't want jump to much content and be completely lost story wise.
---
&gt; He is really, really good at what he does
---
So you're telling me I can't trust anything he says, yet you trust the word of a company without a second thought? It is possible that he is an incredibly good social engineer that lies every chance he gets, it is also possible that he is a shit liar and really fucking bad at what he does. For example that quip about how the prosecutor immediately agreed to drop everything and the defender joking about it? That's *obviously* embelished as fuck. But considering Anet's track record and other stories about their support I will 100% buy into the narrative that the effort it took to get these accounts was probably negligible. **Also** MOP claims to have independently confirmed some parts of his story, so unless you wanna sell me on the narrative that MOP either conveniently only confirmed things he wasn't lying about, or MOP is lying too, I'm gonna maintain that this is a perfectly fine article about a topic any sane consumer should want to know more about.
---
yea they are raid builds which frequently operate under the assumption you'll have boons and other buffs provided for you
---
that being said, in most cases you can make some small adjustments for solo gameplay..in some cases such as reaper and dps chrono(illusions) you have to make no changes because the builds are already very self-sufficient
---
deciding whether a build is good or not can be quite daunting if you lack in-depth knowledge of the game..i could give some pointers but this really takes time/effort
---
for instance let's use our chrono example again: if you look at the benchmark video it has the damage log in description so you can see which skill is what % of the damage
---
but your 2nd highest source of damage is your autoattack because you use it more often so it contributes more overall..these types of distinctions come with experience really and i would have to write walls of text describing them all
---
if you have advanced questions there are people that know this stuff better than me on the SC discord so i strongly suggest checking that out
---
I don't think he should have been banned. You can say 'oh, if he didn't want to be banned he wouldn't have done such a malicious act.' The problem is Anet didn't listen until it became malicious. They should have fixed it before it escalated to that level.
---
The devs should not punish a player for making a spectacle of a problem they refused to solve.
---
League is actually the reverse, they started with an in-lore league and removed that part of the lore years later!
---
What a surprise. Block and ban the one actually giving a shit about the security in your company ArenaNet. It's an M.O. by now to be fair.
---
Social engineers...my System's Security professor always said that the weakest link in any system are the people, and the more I read about "hackings" and breaches the more I realize that's actually pretty true.
---
Isnt this what Gw2 is all about? Run in Meta-Train circles, to get Gold/Hour to buy some glamour from the shop or use the gold per hour to craft glamour?
---
I think he finally hit a point where he can't ignore the state of things and is mentally cracking under the strain.
---
more like Anet 0.1
---
First step : unlock raptor . First POF mission. Game changer
---
Wow, so edgy
---
If you think gw2 is the game where they'll go to, I'd call you delusional at best
---
Troll? Dude tried to contact Anet, even getting into touch with devs on the forums and providing legitimate case numbers which proved he was right, which was ignored and claimed ended in a denial although 3 other accounts linked there was given. At that point it was Anets fault what happened, judge was spot on by referencing Microsoft and Bill Gates, dude just went in, said "I'm Bill Gates" and they let him in to his office, even after giving Bill Gates and the associated high level management the clear security flaw for months.
---
Engi flamethrower is a slower frontal cone, it works. The enemies do proc renewed justice but even binding them to something easy like f for tome and spam one it gets old after a couple hours compared to just hitting 1 on random mobs and 4 on doors.
---
&gt; The third option is the pro option since I can't remember where that button is in the middle of a fight.
---
Probably why most people grab for their phone....
---
Okay, I may just have to take you up on that offer. I still need to finish leveling I only level 50 I think, so I have a bit of leveling to do before being able to do raids and strike things.
---
I'm not defending ANET? And I'm certainly not defending some pompous kid who thinks that they should be rewarded for wreaking havoc on people's accounts. 
---
"Social engineer" my ass.
---
Those frogs were priceless! /s
---
Wow, you know I’ve come to expect ArenaNet to have subpar management but to not only dismiss proof of a major security flaw continually and then have the nerve to pursue CRIMINAL CHARGES on somebody for pointing out that flaw shows their leadership is actually pants on head retarded. I can’t believe what a shitshow this company is.
---
I have limited playtime with warrior and almost all my hours are in revenant so I believe you. I was just speaking to my experience as a rev and nearly never going down or worrying about getting downed. I will agree they are poor at condition cleanse and are very susceptible to condi enemies. I am going to start playing a bit more on warrior to get a better feel for the comparison
---
I enjoy reading through your thought process and setups. Congratulations on the successful kill!
---
The perfect fairy-tale ending
---
Pretty much this.
---
He was right, you know.
---
\^
---
So step one... getting mounts to make stuff easier
---
Step two... Story
---
Step three.. grinding time for flying mounts and other stuff
---
I am on the same boat as you, playing with new players which doesn't mean "I have to stay away from everything and just kill moas". 
---
I proposed the account-bound AR on another post and was immediately bombarded with "game economics" in regards of that *every player with exotic gear would then come to do fractals and then agony resistance will lose its value* type of thing. I call bs. They even said "what's the purpose of having ascended gear then?" Well...
---
I for one would like to see AR as an account bound currency. You still need to grind a character, you keep the value of it in-game. I'd say if not account-bound, at least class-bound like in, all my light armor classes will have Agony Resistance equals to the highest Agony Resistance character *in your account.* That way if you have 3 warriors all you have to worry about is 1 and if you have 3 warriors, 2 mesmers all you have to worry about to gear up is 2 characters.
---
What I got was a reinforcement that Anet is full of amateurs with no foresight.
---
True...but I forgot about them \*badumtsss\*
---
I have a better idea. You buy the game get all loots and level by standing in LA and then spend all your wadges on gem store, oh and lets not forget all raid ap's 
---
EZ game
---
I did Twilight Arbor story and explorables for the first time the other day and got a full party pretty fast by going to Lion’s Arch and saying that I have an LFG up. I’m thinking that part of the reason why dungeon LFG doesn’t seem to work well is that most people don’t actively check that interface, even if they’re interested in doing the content.
---
Yes it does break etiquette (in NA at least) but if someone is really getting into WvW, one of the most important things they are going to have to learn is to shrug off deaths.  And you can't just always expect people to "be cool" in an open-world 24/7 PvP mode.
---
Lol you completely failed at the one small task I provided and decided instead to just copy paste literally everything because you couldn’t find the specific snippet of a claim you made, that I asked for you to copy paste. 
---
I can’t imagine you do very well academically, because if this were an assignment, you would have failed with a score of 0.
---
&gt;You randomly losing your shit because the voices in your head spoke to you?
---
Really? The “no u” argument? Guess we’ll just tack “unoriginal” to the list of things that you are.
---
&gt;Ciao ciao
---
Are you French? Because if you’re not, yikes.
---
&gt;Anyway, this was amusing for a while but now I'm bored. Have a great life. Hopefully you'll get over your issues and live a happier, more balanced life.
---
I dunno man, you’ve said closing remarks like three times, can you resist replying to this one? It’s almost like you can’t help yourself, You just gotta have the last word.
---
Lab is the best. Shush.
---
You are totally right!
---
I'm really sorry, I forgot that typical people doesn't think this way. Since my childhood I found any form of reptiles adorable, even if they are large and merciless reptiles like crocodiles and dragons like Elders. So I get excited on any information about the dragons. 
---
And actually, them being the forces of nature makes them even cuter.
---
Who cares about PvP anymore? Anet for sure not!
---
No Anet should not capitalise on it because they are a GAMING COMPANY what do people not understand about that. You want politics go to the youngturks, BBC Parliament now on twitch. Read the news just keep politics out of games period.
---
Power Rev is mostly about camping Glint for boons, and using the assassin drain skill. You camp 1 weapon set and use 3 skills off cooldown. There is more finesse to warrior in doing your damage under your damage modifiers, and using more skills in general
---
I remember them banning people for giving information about exploits via exploits@arena.net
---
yes sorry its NA, ill edit original post. any class any race. Only thing exempt is outfits  :D
---
&gt; I could try
---
Yes you could.  And you'd gain experience and might even learn a bit about combat if you did.  Maybe you'd see yourself improving over time and eventually come to enjoy fighting?
---
The issue with builds like these is that they just aren't very good. That carrion condi thief build is also poor.
---
Unless you are wanting to run things just because they are odd, alternatives such as power staff Daredevil with Invigorating Precision for AoE or a whole myriad of Payback Deadeye builds for general situations will do a better job.
---
Not GW2 related, but have you tried Diablo 3 on that resolution? Or Torchlight 2? That FOV makes me quite curious.
---
&gt;The issue with builds like these is that they just aren't very good. 
---
Cool story bro.

Parts of me want to also believe this but then I'm remembered that they couldn't even officially announce new elite specs for season 5, let alone game-changing features, and the more they wait, the more armor parts they would need to adapt.
---
It doesn't look good. :(
---
He didn't hack anything. Anet employee himself gave him access to Gaile's account.
---
I guess he didn't break the law, although it doesn't seem super legal to me to pretend to be someone else. And regardless of his intentions I don't think he did the "right thing". 
---
It doesn't surprise me that so many people think he was in the right to do what he did, and it's true they weren't listening to him, which is a shame because there was or is a real problem here. But I don't think that excuses the behavior of the person. And I'm sorry but I don't think they own him an apology. They thought he broke the law (which I would have as well) and they went after him. He wasn't 13 years old, he was 19.
---
Luckily for the person the laws in Germany are different and I guess it's not illegal to pretend to be someone else.
---
To those reporting this as drama. No. This is not drama. This is a viable news article regarding ArenaNet, the developers of this game and is absolutely a worthwhile post that would never be removed even if ANet asked us to remove it.
---
And on a personal note... https://i.imgur.com/JPXa7SO.jpg
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
That's neat you find reptiles cute that way, but your personal feelings don't really change how they're supposed to be in the story.
---
250*
---
I still love it though lol
---
That's fine, then you don't disagree with my original claim, which was that this story is a perfectly valid article to write. I only took issue with the other guy because he tried to make it sound like this is a blatant "cash grab" by MOP to fuel unwarranted drama.  
---
It's fine to not trust the "hacker" from the article, but even without trusting anything he says, unless you allege that MOP fabricated and lied to their readers about their own fact finding, the findings they independently verified are bad enough for me.
---
Despite the actions it took for him to get to that point I hope integrity is upheld because Arenanets security Ought to be able to catch malicious attempts to change email for how long this all took to happen.
---
Viscount is still one of the best open-world bosses in the game. Viscount+Steve pull is just fantastic. And the race is a pretty good one too.
---
And even it weren’t; you should keep in mind the context of when it was released. There was hardly even a dungeon meta at the time.
---
gotta love pvp
---
&gt; And with well timed cc abilities breaking the bar, it can dismount the rider.
---
A ton of us would prefer this over the Lance ability. It gives counter play to the mount but also gives the rider a chance to maneuver around. Lance takes a lot of that away.
---
#Yes.
---
For someone who promises they weren't mad, just apathetic, you do seem pretty mad about lance.
---
I'll go back to pvp when we get new maps and new elite specs , glhf.
---
Sounds like I should make a new character and do this
---
I think he's sitting at like 10-20k viewers on mixer, and when he streams non-fortnite he drops sub 10
---
pls dont do RIBA farm...
---
Is one of the worse ways to get gold and slowly destroys your braincells and enjoyment to play this game
---
Criminal charges against someone who warned them multiple times, even publicly.
---
Then there was the banwave thing from last year where someone had to use the GDPR to warn ANet they had banned people for no reason. 
---
Jesus Christ. Seriously, ANet. Other people do your work for you because you're too incompetent to do it properly, then you snap back at them all the while doing nothing to fix your glaring issues? 
---
I guess the spaghetti code must be in their brains.
---
Here we GOOOO on the hate train, anet lazy and just literally cut the tentacle and shove it in the sky scales ass
---
Thats the reason why default skins look ..... so default? You pay to shine and the tentacle goes away :D
---
I’d rather people who didn’t bother keep their keys and receipts not to bitch and moan while demanding anet lower account security for everyone else because they don’t have them.
---
You really think a journalist or media company will hand over court documents to a rando skeptic online so that you can satisfy your curiosity?  The article isn't releasing the person's name for obvious reasons.
---
MassivelyOP isn't some teenage blog.  They're actual journalists who research stories and claims before publication.  And the stuff they can't verify, they come forward and state that they can't verify.  That's pretty transparent on their part.
---
That is weird, I remember having this dialog window, but I just clicked "Trust this developer" or whatever it is in English, and launched the game without problems (MacBook Pro 2017, after fresh update to Catalina from Mojave).
---
The first time doing the festival is always the most incredible. Its the most well developed and diverse festival in my opinion, only rivaled by wintersday.
---
(For example, SAB festival is well developed, but not exactly diverse)
---
FWIW, I believe that they did, and I myself will still be playing the game without much fear. I do think everyone should take extra precautions with all online accounts, all the same.
---
When you're going solo, it's all one shit  
---
When you're with a team, I'd say that guardian should be your go-to  
---
Revenant is quite boring and has two builds, warrior can be a bit more flexible (but warriors are also more common, might be harder to find a party later on), guardian, however, can cover many roles, depending on the build. You can get a power dps (great for fractals, great for raids) condi dps (good/viable for raids), support dps (great for fractals, necessary for raids if you run only one chrono) and healer (not really useful if your team is skilled, it's more often filled by revenant)  
---
So I'd say guardian. It's a great all around class that will allow you quite a bit of flexibility.
---
Never said it wouldn't need numbers adjustments, but it would still be more balanced then it is now.
---
As for virtues, of course they don't grant great burns by themselves.
---
But if you mix it with radiance then either zeal or FB you can damn sure get allot more then a couple stacks every few seconds thanks to burning spirit weapons or mantras.
---
Nicenice
---
Well it would have been better as they'd be given a load of money if they got laid off.
---
Your art is so nice ;u;
---
Social engineering is used as an excuse by too many companies when their security miserably fails. Of course social engineering can be a powerful tool, but when you see the level of "social engineering" used, you can only blame anet and their CS.
---
The "social engineering" i'm referring to :
---
&gt;Another GM was insisting that I provide some actual information. [Lynie] Said "oh, nevermind, it's not actually my account". Got sent a reset link 10 minutes later.
---
Well you said "virtues alone", so....
---
And "more balanced" than what? The only place where the F1 recharge shines is in horde PvE situations, and it's still not doing the most AoE damage in the game. It's not unbalancing PvP or WvW, that's for sure, and it's not pulling top DPS in fractals or raids. I don't see why you're so adamantly convinced that this interaction is OP when it's quite clear that it's an intended playstyle for the class in general PvE.
---
Allot of them are hard to notice.
---
There are the obvious ones like speed hacks, flight ect but there are also the less obvious ones that make all enemies always show on the mini map or screen
---
As for how to actually get rid of them in game reports do next to nothing.
---
Record them and post it all over youtube if you want results.
---
why are you wasting laurels on ascended trinkets first of all, thats the part i want to know, second if youre a "vet" why didnt you just look at a wiki so you know what youre actually buying if you need AR. Or just read the slot text and realize its not an infusion slot
---
Sounds like your posts are just trying to stir up drama, [like this one that mods removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/av3nm2/massively_article_game_workers_unite_calling_for/).  You don't know there are other criminal cases pending, yet you push the idea even after the Massively writer's reply.
---
I think the story in recent episodes is good. The most recent episode is by far the best I have ever played. The zone fits extremely well with the story, I would say the newest zone is made for the story rather than the other way round.
---
Agreed that in parts (a lot of parts actually) the story is awful. But I love the combat and it's just far too clunky for me in FFXIV. I would say GW2 has the best combat and is literally the main thing that keeps the game alive.
---
Also mounts are the best.
---
If you actually want them gone record them then report it, then also post it all over youtube.
---
They ban them allot faster when you do that because it = bad press.
---
&gt; I'm going to go out on a limb and say that 15 minutes is not a standard acquisition time for a player who reached level 80 for the first time, suited up in exotics, and dipped their toes into WvW.
---
No it isn't, but it's a good thing that wasn't a point of discussion I was replying to; save your strawman attempts for intellects inferior to your own - not the opposite.
---
You mocked the notion of someone getting the mount in 2hrs, and I mocked your mockery.  Would a cookie make the hurt feelings go away?
---
&gt;Also, the post ends with, and I'm paraphrasing here, "ya, it definitely scares off new players, but you know, them's the breaks!"
---
Because the person you are quoting has a solid grasp of how this game mode is managed, whereas clearly you do not.  Comically Disconnected?  Not on this end my friend.
---
Content... I mean running in circles is just something the players made not the devs. I don't see anything stopping random patterns or actually reading the lore and diving into it all. Classic players turning a game into a robotic process for loot imo. Gotta get that cheese or I won't be the cool kids kinda vibe. The best way to get that cheese you ask... Running in circles pressing 1 with 50 other players. Where's the content.
---
Op is a well known anet whiteknight, take a look through their post history.
---
Well then I can’t wait for it, thank you!
---
&gt;A true greyhat wouldn't have caused so much destruction to innocent player accounts.
---
Congratulation, you just discovered the difference between greyhat and whitehat, and why Lynie is a greyhat.
---
I have to say i admire his persistence and German courts that have at least a marginally working court process instead of relying always in absurdly broad laws that can bend to mean anything.
---
And i can definitely get behind the article's conclusion:
---
"But it’s a cautionary tale for everyone involved: for would-be greyhat hackers who want to help and still stay out of trouble with the law, for studios that put a little too much faith in the competence of their support personnel and security protocols, and for players too – for the sake of the Six, enable 2FA."
---
Enable you damn 2fA in every service you can. Even the best security can fail. So do not trust only others to handle it.
---
WvW has them, PvE dont
---
A net made the bots based off the gw1 hero AI. Without them it would only be 6 or 7 of you guys and queue would be infinitely waiting for the last 3 players.  /s I hope?
---
LOL, "a heavily competitive mode.", as a "competitive" game mode WvW is one of the least competitive you will ever find.
---
From the article 
---
&gt;"In those situations, we always aim to roll back accounts to their original status, including reversing any changes that may have been made without the player’s knowledge.
---
This DOES NOT happen with GW1 accounts btw, the tool support used broke shortly after GW2 happened.
---
They also reset very often in wvw, I personally have seen it turn a couple of moderate sized fights as once it gets rolling &amp; you have condi cover it just snowballs.
---
As for it being intended or not, Yes it is but that doesn't mean they could not have made things other ways (other ways that would also  be easier to balance)
---
I think he pretends to be outraged so that it confuses people when they realise he is probably the biggest whiteknight on this sub.
---
Can't add much to what's already been said, other than you can convert gold to gems and get story episodes that way. I say this because following the story is a nice way to be introduced gradually to new maps.
---
I also took a 5 year break and did the full story before spending time on each map. Now I've got all the maps completed but I'm still learning the HOT metas before moving on to PoF. I felt overwhelmed and I like to progress with a certain logic.
---
A lot of mounts require playing specific episodes (griffon, beetle) or having completed masteries, so I'd stick to raptor for now.
---
Whisper me in-game anytime if you have specific doubts (zoejo.2317).
---
There is that but wow also has mount hunting which i love doing.
---
Also i dont get how your friends are having trouble with a T1 fractal but you think they would be able to raid competently if it was changed to 5 man.
---
The individual skills all have their own cooldowns. The most you can do is spam 1 more often if you're recharging it in WvW, which isn't that powerful a skill and certainly isn't what you bring a firebrand in your squad for. The reason it's useful in PvE is because you can drop #4 often enough that if you're staying in one spot, you have pretty continuous aoe damage around you, but that's not exactly important in WvW. 
---
This isn't an OP skill or interaction at all, and I greatly prefer what we have over implementing them as kits, because the F2 and F3 skills can have huge impacts without being problematic since they're locked behind such long cooldowns.
---
Wow
---
Both anet's official statement and the article are asking you to activate 2FA (and you definitely should). But is anyone of them aware that the security breach entirely bypasses the 2FA anyway? Let's not act like 2FA will protect you from a shitty CS granting access to anyone with little to no information about the account and its legitimate owner.
---
All the points are SERIOUS, otherwise why have them???
---
I know right? How the heck did they come up with that number? If anything **they** wasted 1 million bucks trying to sue a kid that basically did nothing illegal.
---
How fun, but couldn't a link to this be posted in the original thread instead?
---
No, it makes sense. Why would another company, even if the employees worked there previously, comment about an anecdote from another company.
---
Well, good luck to anyone trying to even log in into their website through my account without my phone.
---
So basically let me get this straight, you're mad because the game becomes more secure due to some guy managing to prove that they have many security flaws?
---
&gt;Social engineering is used as an excuse by too many companies when their  security miserably fails. Of course social engineering can be a  powerful tool, but when you see the level of "social engineering" used,  you can only blame anet and their CS.
---
This is a prevalent problem on lots of support teams. I can't count the amount of times we made teams go through social engineering training and they just ignored the policy anyway. There's only so much that can be done before you just throw up your hands and say "Your problem, then". Especially if said people are your superiors (I've had some bad experiences here)
---
Not defending ArenaNet as a company, but this specific point is really misrepresenting the situation.
---
They didn’t pursue him because he pointed something out, they pursued him because of the actions he took using the flaw in their CS. Once you abuse something you can’t act as if you don’t deserve punishment for it.
---
Hell, he didn’t need to do everything he did. He could have simply mouthed off and made it obvious he had gained access to the account without destroying items. He did what he did because he was a stupid, upset child.
---
&gt;  I'll make it work as I have no plans on spending more money on the game.
---
Pretty much sums up what I currently think of the game after the reveal of the build templates. It is just yet another cash grab with very limited amount you can store.
---
Bank tabs are heavily monetized, character slots are heavily monetized, bag slots are super-heavily monetized on a character-base, mount skins, glider skins, 90% of the skins are gem store items, etc.
---
I rarely switch builds, but I do play multiple modes and it will probably be easier to just not swap the builds that often or copy/paste the build links when I do. I have enough characters to have 2 of each classes, so I'll make do with what I have, but it really sucks and I won't be giving any more $$ to GW2 until we have more communication and they listen to feedback before releasing features. At release, I tried to get everything done, but after a while, I just couldn't care less anymore. There's just no point anymore.
---
I still enjoy the game and regularly do WvW, but I no longer care about any end-game. I just do some stuff with guildmates or do some meta events while watching Netflix or Twitch.
---
I appreciate that you attempted to undermine my statement by suggesting that it was an opinion before presenting your argument on the basis of its own merits.
---
However, in your argument you state "an infinite number of infinitely short lines will exactly approximate a curve." And I agree with that. No matter how exact the approximation is, though, a connected series of lines is not how a circle or any other curve is defined.
---
The difference is between a Taylor series with an infinite number of terms and an integral.
---
Regardless of how well an infinite collection of corners might approximate a curve, a curve does not have corners. Lines are defined by a linear function. Curves are defined by exponential functions (which can be derived through integration or approximated through a series of linear functions.)
---
&gt; The most recent change to MF not affecting containers that I can remember was Unidentified Gear. 
---
...so that's what it was! Good thing I re-asked, duh.
---
Now that you mention it, yeah I remember some times I was dismounted by condis.....it was painful too, thanks for reminding me.
---
Yes, but she's been out for 3 years or so by now. I miss her ;-;
---
Added bonus (for your enemy) is the condis they dump on your mount transfer to you after dismount, so your health pool is already chipped.
---
That’s a pretty low bar considering the story. I’m not defending ArenaNet or their security, I just find it a bit silly that people are actually trying to act like this idiot deserves any kind of public sympathy or apologies.
---
Running lab is pretty damn boring but I still look forward to it every year and I love it.
---
I'm pretty sure there are different sizes of infinity, like the number of integers is infinite but still infinitely smaller than the number of irrational numbers or something to that effect. Like n*pi where n goes from 0 to infinity is still an infinite number of irrational numbers but there are an infinite number of other irrational numbers that can can form a set of infinities equally large
---
Yet they ban froggers in twitch chat.
---
&gt; If you read all of this, you have my sincerest thanks.
---
I feel the need to tell you that I did not.
---
The thing is, he does deserve sympathy and an apology. You don't just sue people because you don't like what they did.
---
i post all my events on my highlights videos in twitch and on youtube. im new to reddit so i can post it here aswell for u guys if ud like.
---
Until you run into someone who just HATES Choyas...
---
Watermelon Sand Shark seems more whimsical though :)
---
&gt;"Manifesto"
---
I stopped right there.
---
OP isn't content
---
Have you told them that /wiki exists?   
---
You're not Cameron, don't pretend you have a savior complex and just tell them how to find information on their own. I personally can answer most of the stuff from memory, but if I don't know something, I check wiki. It's that easy, type /wiki Agony Resistance and you suddenly have all the knowledge you need two pages away at worst.
---
You do in the US.
---
This, I worked insurance for a while, in particular a company that likes to assure it’s customers that they’re being taken care of, and rolls out commercials in which disaster is personified. and it was **absolutely INSANE** how susceptible we were to mishandling of information and hacking by social engineering means or otherwise. 
---
My boss would install all kinds of shit that typically comes packaged with malware, like toolbars. I would constantly have to remove them. Eventually the company began rolling out security measures for the computers that we had to be in compliance with, it took my boss until the last minute to get the ball rolling on these updates. She would keep folders with sensitive information, **right on her desktop**. She kept sticky notes with all her login info and passwords **right under her monitor** and require that our info also be under our monitors in case she needed access to our computers. 
---
Physical files with customer information were to be locked in a filing cabinet, the filing cabinet’s keys were hidden right behind the cabinet. We would also have files in our desk drawers which we did not have the keys to and my boss would not lock, she also kept a stack of files sorted on her desk on her office, which had no door. 
---
I ended up leaving for other opportunities but the fact that I was responsible for the sensitive information of others and I knew how insecure all of it was, was high up there on the list of reasons I left, with reason number 1 being that my boss was withholding tax money from our checks, but wasn’t actually using it to pay the taxes and instead blew it all on paying the light bill, as the office was struggling to stay afloat since the **same company** opened another office nearby.
---
In summation: Your information is NEVER secure, human  error and managerial incompetence will ensure that it remains insecure. The only thing preventing your identity from theft is that you’re **one** person in a sea of billions of people and some other poor schmuck is likely dealing with identity theft right now, but it could happen to you any moment, you could be that next one in a million in the identity theft lotto. My situation may have been particularly worse than the norm, but who’s to say pretty much any other company doesn’t have  it’s weak spots?
---
Raids don't need ascended at all. Full exotic to full ascended is an average DPS increase of ~13% but most of that is weapon alone (6%) and only missing armor is ~3%. Having ascended weapon and trinkets is a decent buff in raids but getting things like ascended armor and stat infusions is very unnecessary where as in fractals you need the armor in T4 to do things past 105 AR. Also why not just move your gear between characters then? The value in a lot of items and gear is the convenience of not having to do all that.
---
send it to /r/talesfromtechsupport
---
I’m actually pretty sure this could be pushed into the “illegal” side of things actually. You impersonated someone to access their personal account.
---
I'm sure you do.  I heard they upscale you to lvl 80 so you don't have to worry about it and events that happen in Lion's Arch Halloween hub aren't measured by level
---
You are right, there are many builds that can dismount. I've only found the longbow soulbeast build to be "reliable." Of course, what makes something "reliable" is more a matter of opinion.
---
Interesting read, thanks. I agree with almost everything you said, I just have one thing to address.
---
&gt;Heart of Thorns, on its advertisement and purchase site, promised a New Line of Legendary Weapons.
---
So a bit of background on my end; I started playing around October 2016, and I didn't buy HoT until around December that same year. I didn't make my first HoT legendary until mid 2017.
---
I never really kept up with what was being posted on their site until much later, so I didn't get to this part.
---
But what exactly did you have in mind when they said that it'd be a "new line"? Like new weapons? Because looking back, I don't think that's what you'd want, especially with their rep in balancing. Yeah new weapons sound good on paper, but I'd bet that if they had added new weapons, their balancing would get even more out of hand. 
---
I agree with you though that 4 years is too long to release the entire set.
---
I think the key word you left out of your original comment, but included here, was "approximate". It is true that with the current limit of the accuracy of our measurements, you wouldn't be able to detect a difference between the circumference of a circle and the perimeter length of the infinite-edge circle, but with infinite accuracy you would eventually see a difference.
---
Yes, all events can be done at any level and they boost you to lvl 80 if in an instance.
---
The only limitation is a Free to Play Account under level 30 b/c they cannot teleport to Lion's Arch (the hub city) until that point. But you can easily get to level 30 from Halloween Events.
---
For your information the code is not a black magic. Any slightly more experienced programmer can easily use the old game code to create new things. Also do you srsly think that people leave before sharing their knowledge of how the code works? You are a Moron :)
---
It was roughly a decade ago, so yeah, a bit of a ways back.  We pulled the list of sites they were accessing, and yeah, there was some pretty extreme stuff, but nothing illegal (thankfully).
---
This points lack of security on anet's side but is not an excuse for the hacker. If you don't lock your house and someone breaks in and steals or damages your stuff, he's still a burglar and will still be punished by law. And I'm sure the judge will not even ask him about the door being unlocked.
---
Tengus are the "birdman" race. You can find some of them at a hero point in Caledon Forest
---
It's more like... 
---
How to explain it.
---
The simplest answer would be that people are assholes. But on the spectrum of assholeness, helpdesk people are much closer to 'fuck you, I ain't gonna care if you don't care to pay me a living wage' (living wage as in I can rent a small studio apartment and still have money to eat healthy and still have a bit spare for fun and savings) than to 'fuck you, I'll now use all the data I have to ruin your company'
---
Also, you'd be fined and drag through courts so much that you wouldn't be able to ever pay yourself off.
---
Nope, he didn't impersonate someone, he had no access to the owners details so it's not identity theft.
---
The last time they were open with their playerbase, they couldn't live up to the promises Colin presented. They were bashed repeatedly by the fanbase. Then they tried to communicate while avoiding promises. And the fanbase took 'we are looking at X and Y, but don't promise it' as promises, and did the same thing again. Why should they choose to repeat this?
---
Be doesn’t deserve either. He wasn’t innocent, and what he did was shitty. He knew it was shitty or else he’s got something wrong with him.
---
I’m all behind people who try to abuse system, regardless of how weak they are, getting hassled in a way beyond simple bans that seem to barely discourage anyone.
---
it sounds like anet wouldn't have listened no matter what he did unless it was something like hacking gailes account.. oh wait. honestly he is completely in the right here, a couple CS agents not doing their jobs could be forgiven but at least 2 of their superiors were informed of this and they decided "yeah nah that's not happening" without an investigation, they are now the ones responsible for anything that happens, it's literally their job to make sure this kind of shit doesn't happen and when it does they are supposed to fix it. why you got such a vendetta against this dude?
---
They actually have been open with the playerbase. Their Icebrood Saga presentation answered some questions about the structure of future content.
---
It was lacking in anything about PvP, WvW, raids, fractals, and elite specs.
---
Therefore, those things are not changing. That is the communication. Don't wait for them to announce that something will no longer be supported, because they will never do that. I'd like for this to be wrong but this is what I got out of that presentation.
---
Also, I doubt ArenaNet is fully focused on GW2. Many of their open headcounts are asking for UE experience and do not mention Guild Wars.
---
more like 30k hours
---
would you rather that this loophole went on for years and people lost accounts to it? you can bet that if he found it out, someone else would have. frankly they are lucky that he was the first to find out about it, he didn't take items or grief anyone except gailes official account (not her personal one). perhaps vendetta is too strong a word, grudge might be better. i've seen a few comments you've made in this thread saying similar things to the one that i replied to and that gives the impression that you have a grudge or some kind of personal grievance against him. if he did the wrong thing, the german court would not have vindicated him, sometimes you gotta go to more extreme measures (like when people don't listen and risk player accounts because of their hubris) in order to make sure that this kind of thing can't be used to actually harm players.
---
The truth has been revealed! 
---
This is why they ban pepe emotes.
---
Chrono lost his ability to make the whole team invincible. Without that it's better to pick firebrigade, since having more dps is better than not being able to make people immortal.
---
If they really wanted to make money they'd start putting their own PvP bots into the gem store functioning like GW1 heroes.
---
Yes, big yes. Communication is the only thing that can save this game. Everyone know how much communication is important.  
---
If you want to stop the leak, communication is the first step to help.
---
That's so sad to waste this incredible game..
---
I never said that some of the responses she received after the event weren't over the top or offensive. I'm talking about the incident itself where she presumed that someone disagreeing with her was sexist when it wasn't. Just like you're saying I'm supposedly brainwashed by male supremacists for having a differing opinion from yourself. It's gross to me to pretend to be a victim when you aren't or to call someone essentially a terrible person when they aren't. 
---
This is really offensive to say to people when they're not even being sexist, that is why she got fired. She would've gotten fired all the same if she claimed someone disagreed because she was black or gay. It's the presumption, the same one you're aiming towards me right now, that made it offensive. People aren't instantly evil or sexist because they disagree with you.
---
Honestly, I just hope you can get away from all that hatred you seem to hold, that's no way to live. All I'll say is that you're very wrong. But I know I'm probably talking to a brick wall and you'll just twist the narrative into something it's not so you can be right and everyone else is sexist and evil. Not every differing opinion is sexist. I wish you the best of luck
---
I didn't want to know this.
---
It's fun if you know it exists. I was rather pissed that I kept getting knocked off my mount so easily, not knowing there was a new skill I had to activate.

Not claiming I play a lot of pvp, but I've played some ranked(~20 games) over the past few days and haven't noticed anything. What exactly do you mean when you say "bots"? What am I looking for and are they more prevalent in specific brackets?

Again, good luck putting a dollar amount to something to 1) people who don’t understand it and 2) only has value on a digital black market. There’s a reason why this got laughed out of court.

People here won't recognize it, because circlejerk ArenaNet hate, but issues like this usually depend on *exceptional* abuse of the system.
---
Other things you might be surprised about in the real world is how:
---
* A signature is a really shit method of authentication, but we still rely on it.
---
* If you own a car, parking it anywhere in public "is just poor security and you deserve to get your tires popped, Don't bother going *anywhere* with shared parking lots."
---
* Most doors can easily be lockpicked because most locks are shit. If you haven't looked into a lock that is the exception, chances are that it isn't stopping any slightly dedicated attempt.
---
* Any time you give anyone your credit card and/or its details, it's a trust issue. Even without RFID, anyone with your credit card details can sell them in the dark web with very little likelihood of being found out, if they wait long enough.
---
* When you go out into the public, you are just a moment of opportunity away from being subdued in any number of ways. From a random lethal stab, to tasers, to well timed brick or acid filled bag, to the more modern eye evaporating lasers, there is no way to easily eliminate the possibility.
---
* Regardless of any contract you agree to, if the other side has enough witnesses that aren't suspected of other crimes and considered trustworthy, they can get away with completely falsifying  any contract you signed up for.
---
* Think you are getting hired? Nope, they are just collecting your personal information so they can abuse it.
---
* Civil Forfeiture.
---
The real world outside of this subreddit is full of exploitable, socially engineerable encounters. The reason you don't cower in fear for your life is because most of these dangers are considered *exceptional*. Most people have enough of a moral compass to realize not to do this. It's why there wasn't a 9/11 in over 50 years of commercial flights.
---
ArenaNet isn't blameless, they could have added more steps and a tiered check list of account verifications along with a more rigorous account verification process. But the reason they didn't is because regardless of the culprit's fear-mongering, it is not something they really have to worry about in the same way that you don't fear for your life every time you go outside and have a normal life. Everything the culprit described has been exploited in other MMOs as well, and you can even Google search a few guides to how to do them for the most popular ones.
---
Of course, given the increasing degree of toxicity from a subreddit that is no longer removing stories that illustrate how to do this sort of social engineering, they certainly should be trying to enforce more rigorous checks, in the same manner that the increased checks after 9/11 were justified. The metaphorical terrorism is certainly something to worry about in these parts, as this subreddit has even been used to suggest RMT someone to get them banned *"as an example"*.
---
Whoa. Thats... Alot
---
I'm personally happy with bragging rights ;)
---
By posting something on account that wad not his, he was impersonating them.
---
Everyones hoards making mine look tiny lmao :D nice to see that my problem isnt as bad yet
---
More like can’t. But dang, you pulled out the “kid” card. You really got me I guess.
---
Im ok i think.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/VKHPy19.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VKHPy19.jpg)
---
Arguing for no reason like a kid, lol. Enjoy the block.
---
I have no vendetta or grudge against him. I don’t see the heroism in it that everyone else does, and I commented as much.
---
He seemed like an arrogant prick in the interview quotes, nothing more.
---
Holy shit, an actual article from massivelyop.com?!
---
And a well done one as well!
---
I would agree with you if his actions hadn’t been more motivated by anger. If he specifically did it to help ArenaNet and the game I’d be more agreeable, but he admits himself that he was upset he couldn’t get his old account back. Between that admission and the fact he messed with items (when he didn’t need to to get attention, he only needed to be vocal on the account) it seems pretty clear that this “I was trying to help” narrative is just a justification.
---
Nope because an online game account is not proper document of identity.
---
I didn't even bother after I somehow saw "manifesto" randomly.
---
thats 2400 inventory slots occupied by dragonite, bloodstone and empys
---
Read again, you missed the point entirely. I'm not humblebragging how good I am. I'm not good at all. But yeah bust that Dunning-Kruger out as if that's some obscure shit. It's only posted and misused 50 times a day on reddit. 51 times today I guess.
---
It's not highly debatable because the intention to be heard is not something on the set of personal gains.
---
He deleted items he was aware were going to be returned.
---
I haven't been able to get the sniff ability to work. I can be sneaking right beside an enemy squad and nothing shows up.
---
He's also in his 30s and wouldn't care about "hacking" his slightly younger brother. But point taken.
---
Good point.
---
I want to open all of them
---
I don't want the loot just the opening-experience
---
Yes, people still do old raids, none of the raids are obsolete by gear or level.
---
That being said, you can look on lfg but that can be a mixed bag. If you've never raided before, I'd advise finding a training group or training guild to help you out (r/guildrecruitment is a solid place to look for that). Even if you have raided before and don't need training, finding a guild can help find you a solid static group so you can avoid the clusterfuck that are PUGs
---
Ok, what was his intention? What was his motivation?
---
It's on the article, he wanted for Anet to acknowledge they had a huge security flaw in support.
---
I think he did just try and help at first, he tried to tell them and they just didn't listen.
---
There’s a difference between something having a monetary value and proving it in court while convincing a judge. 
---
If I steal a first edition holographic Charizard card off someone, and the judge can’t be convinced it’s worth anything, does that mean the item has no value?
---
I felt bad last night because a guy and I were retaking a camp and I went to check to see if the vet wurm spawned once we finished, but the other player already left, so I started attacking it. I killed it mere milliseconds before they came back to tag it. I'm sorry random person, know that I love you. TTATT
---
its more like giving someone the keys to your house and saying "here its yours now"
---
That's a lot of text I did not read,  but good for you buddy!
---
Is this an elaborate troll post or something? Literally trying to play in to every "care bear" stereotype possible?
---
“In court”
---
... I think that's exactly why you sue people, actually.
---
Something people don't seem to be talking about is the perspective of the account holders of the accounts he used as examples. Did he get permission from these people to use their accounts in such a way? Otherwise, it's willful disruption to other players, even if it's in the interest of everyone. What he should have done was continually notify ArenaNet after the very first instance. If he really felt he needed to repeat the process as an example, then find someone willing to have their account used in such a way so no one is unwillingly inconvenienced.
---
&gt; And the fanbase took 'we are looking at X and Y, but don't promise it' as promises
---
Maybe in the US... People are sued when they do something you don't like and **they break the law while doing it**

DPS chrono is still fine in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) and [raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/). Boon chrono was changed in ways that made it worse in fractals so firebrand took over since it can provide quickness and good damage or quickness and healing and when combined with an alacrity renegade  the two of them bring more damage/utility than druid/chrono did. Boon chrono can still be run in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer) but it's out of meta, it is still meta however [in raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) where most fights run one chrono + quickbrand/alacirgade or double chrono still. It should also be noted that with the last patch on the 1st out [Seize the Moment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seize_the_Moment) trait was made to be AoE and that completely changed a bunch of potential builds. Some chrono setups are now able to hit 26k+ while giving quickness (only) at 0% BD and could replace what a power firebrand was already doing. So we'll have to see how the meta shifts now that chrono can cover 5-10 man quickness super easy. 
---
As for mirage, it's obviously not great in fractals where you want high burst power DPS builds but [in raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) there are many fights where it is the best DPS option by far and it has some open world options that are pretty great too.
---
&gt; What do I do and also how do you get around with our F4 (distortion) removed?
---
So technically chronos get all new shatter skills and the old F4 distortion becomes Continuum split which still gives distortion, we also sill get distortion from all signets when we use blurred inscriptions (basically just ether and SoI, possibly a second SoI with mimic). Also chronos never really needed the F4 distortion, it was nice to have as an extra safety net and easy aegis share but it just means we time our signets for the same effect now. The basic rotation and everything is still unchanged in raids right now (though we may see new builds with the changes).
---
Now show off ur dungeon recipes
---
only 90s kids remember big daddy goose
---
Just another example of how embarrassingly bad this company is managed.
---
&gt; Therefore, those things are not changing. That is the communication. Don't wait for them to announce that something will no longer be supported, because they will never do that.
---
I like how you're just saying "They didn't talk about this, so it's staying and not changing. No news is good news. Oh and they don't announce if something is being abandonned. So no news is bad news." Kinda antithetical.
---
I think ‘literally’ might be a strong word to use here...
---
mounting up also works if you're the only one in ring
---
&gt;I'm not saying there isn't a market for it, I'm saying the market for it in GW2 is so tiny that it's not worth Anet's time.
---
ArenaNet consistently boasts about its [11 million players](https://massivelyop.com/2017/09/22/guild-wars-2-counts-11-million-players/). Isn't it a little hard to imagine that the secondary market for Guild Wars 2 accounts would be "so tiny" that "it's not worth \[their\] time"? I find that pill a little too tough to swallow.
---
&gt;"...Regardless as someone else has pointed out, they would need to change who the accounts are actually owned by (giving them to the players)...
---
As an attorney, I can confidently say this is not the case. The accounts are, now, and would still be owned by the MMORPG developers / producers. What would need to be clarified (and what could be clarified, and would continue to be consistent with the current legal paradigm) is what possessory interest end users have (i.e. what their legal rights are with respect to the access of their account). Only this possessory interest would be transferable, but that's pretty simple from a legal perspective, at least, in the U.S.
---
&gt;...would cause them so much hassle it would outright negate any small profits they would make...
---
I can't agree with this for a number of reasons. What hassle? It's changing a couple of contracts (pretty easy to do), and then building a marketplace, which would require an investment, but would be profitable (i.e. worth it). Remember, profit is a reward for creating something other people highly value. Profit is different from revenue, because profit is Revenue minus Costs. It's the amount of revenue that is left over after costs are subtracted. So, even a $1.00 profit is worthwhile, unless you have a different opportunity to use the same resources to obtain a higher profit. While such opportunities may exist, I'm confident that a secondary market for accounts, operated as a monopoly by MMORPG publishers / developers for their games, would be wildly profitable and popular, if any MMORPG publisher / developer had the courage to implement the idea I've described herein.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting the "small profits" idea. Again... 11 million players, and doing something this radically different would probably attract new players to the game, too. I would need some pretty solid evidence to persuade me that the secondary market would generate negligible revenues or be unprofitable.
---
I like that you have a tab named garbage worth 900g+
---
I mean, if you think about it, it's true.  3 slots per toon is enough for most everyone who doesn't partake in the theorycrafting and character building in the endgame in either WvW or PvE.
---
Hey, its something
---
&gt;ArenaNet had specifically accused him of (paraphrasing the translation here again) the unauthorized use of and breach of computers specifically secured against unauthorized access and then having illegally deleted or altered data in doing so, which would theoretically be prosecuted under the German statute against spying on data in combination with data alteration.
---
&gt;...
---
&gt;“By this point the prosecutor had changed three times,” he said, “and the law they said I had ‘violated’ changed at least half a dozen times and in different combinations. They kept bending into another direction and weren’t sure what I did wrong. Nothing I did seemed to be against the law – stuff like computer sabotage, spying, changing data.”
---
If that is true, they didn't go after him for breaking a specific law, but rather kept trying to bend anything they could think of to go after him.
---
Still waiting for my Kasmeer raptor skin.
---
&gt;Communication got even worse when there was a twitter debacle that deserves no further mention
---
Reddit went on full witch hunt mode at this moment (I can understand, but I think it was way too violent for what it was). Since then, most devs were afraid of posting on reddit, and worst of all, post release Reddit AMAs went fully on the heavily censored forums. That twitter debacle started something so bad for the communication, it's actually disgusting how it is a turning point (Things weren't bright before, I know, but they turned even worse after this).
---
Do the post release AMAs still exist nowadays? Was there any for War Eternal, or even the Prologue?
---
A part of me wonders if the "what's tengu" comment was relating to the fact that they're not playable yet, and not saying they don't know what a tengu is. But tbh poes law is hard to work around nowadays

---
10 for me
---
Someone at NCSoft is probably like:
---
"Why the fuck is it, every time Anet shows up on the news, it's always a bad thing"
---
what about wvw? Is it still active? updates etc.
---
I never knew what a havoc squad was, but now that I know, and now that I know they're called havoc squads, I really want to know how to get into wvw and join one cus that sounds lile so much fun
---
&gt;True, if they adjust it that way it would work but I do not see that happening.
---
Despite your skepticism, which is probably well-founded, this is a post about the way things could be, not the way things are or they way they're likely to be. So, this isn't really constructive.
---
&gt;I also want to address that there are no tools in place that make Account trading on a large scale possible.
---
I know. That's exactly what I'm suggesting. I think ArenaNet (and other MMORPG companies) would profit from the creation of such marketplaces, which each developer / publisher would operate as a monopoly for their games. I think this would be good for players and for the game companies that are always looking for new players and new revenue streams, both of which could be supplied through a legitimate market for secondary accounts.
---
&gt;There is no option to change the E-Mail of an account, meaning you have to ask the support to do this.
---
This is something that could change with a single patch. The technical solution is not a difficult one to implement.
---
&gt;On a large scale that is not possible or would overload Anet's support team.
---
Again, there is a technical solution to this problem. It's a negligible issue.
---
&gt;Since they have not implemented that option after 7 years, I cannot see that happening.
---
They haven't had an adequate incentive to do so. The need to implement such a feature in order to operate a monopoly on account trading for profit would be such an incentive.
---
&gt;I do not know about this point but what about consumer/customer data.
---
Customers / consumers don't have much access to their own account data, when you think about it, because that data is actually owned by ArenaNet.
---
&gt;We give a lot of data away to Anet be it via payment for Gems or just the information we enter for our account. All this is linked to our account. Won't it be an issue for data gathering for anet if accounts change hands?
---
No, when an account is sold, new customer (and payment) information would have to be provided, and the old information would no longer be associated with the account, even if it is stored in ArenaNet's records. This kind of data sequestering is common in nearly every industry. It's the same thing that happens when a customer updates their credit card / payment information because their bank has issued them a new card, or for some other information. The old card information is disassociated with the account and no longer used.
---
&gt;Note, that I have very limited knowledge when it comes to that topic.
---
This is apparent, but I appreciate that you're asking questions and engaging with the topic, anyway. It's gratifying to see that you're interested in, and thinking about, these questions, even though you might not be an informed participant in the conversation. Kudos! :)
---
&gt;As many people stated, credit card and account theft might be an issue and putting tools in place to fix it might not be worth the trouble.
---
This is not really an objection, because anti-fraud protocols already exist for the credit card transactions MMORPG companies engage in, and because it would be relatively easy to deal with account theft as I have elsewhere in this thread described (see my replies to u/Funkativity and u/whiteaden).
---
Oh okay. Dont you hoard all the mats required to craft ascended gear over time?
---
actually true
---
ok? not sure the point you are trying to make. The guy pretended to be someone else to gain access to their accounts in which he did not have permission
---
Staff/Staff is an extremely defensive weapon set and is entirely condi based. If you want good open world results but aren't a super confident player, you can play sword/sword/shield on power chrono and just go nuts. Between Sword 2, Sword 4, and Shield 4, you have plenty of blocks, and shield 5 is an insane cc that also gives you quickness and alacrity. Once you feel more confident you can swap shield to focus for a good trash mob pull and more damage :)
---
The traits are:
---
\- Dueling 1-3-1
---
\- Illusions 1-2-1
---
\-Chronomancer 3-3-3, or 2-3-3 if you're feeling frisky
---
&gt; Ah yes. &lt;1600. Also known as thousands...
---
Semantically, anything from 1,000-999,999 is part of thousands.
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/thousands
---
I don't know how many of them were false positives but I'd say your guess of &lt; 100 is probable. The thing is they did ban many people for 6 months falsely. Thousands? probably not, but still a pretty big blunder.
---
Wvw "active" technically but the population has heavily died off in recent years do to slow game updates that kept the meta in a very stale state. Some things were address in the last patch but your experience is heavily decided on the server you decided to roll on supposedly alliances should address that but a lot of people and guilds that focus in pvp game modes have kinda already been leaving due to the slow development time in that game mode. For spvp more or less the same but replace "alliances" with "swiss style tournaments".
---
Edit: oh and for raids instead of trying to increase the release cadence of something better than 9-10 month interval they are implementing "strike missions" designed to gradually get people used to raid content. But this utterly fails to do so due to the incredible skill gap from their target audience and the "above average playerbase" this lead to the first of which being incredibly easy for any competent group and it being solo'd within the first couple hours of release. Granted this isnt meant for competent players but it shows where development is heading towards. Consider all of this when deciding if thats the game you want to commit your time to.
---
guardian is more resistant. I was really annoyed when staff weaver was nerfed out of meta.

Got it. OK yeah, sorry.

the scary thing is this isn't social engineering by sending out spam emails to users, hoping they voluntarily hand in their login credentials.  This is going through CS and basically annoying them to the point to where they just cave in, despite multitudes of evidence that what they are doing is wrong.

so with the bloodstone brick oven in home instance

does getting chef all the way yo 500 make any difference with this matter?
---
You are very good at making numbers up. Is your world so small that your points has never been challenged before?
---
I agree with that. But the physical property metaphor was a dumb way to try to justify it, so I pointed that out.
---
I thought I was pretty clear about the point I was trying to make. If they thought he broke a law, they would go after him for breaking that law. Instead, they just attacked him for various things and hoped something stuck because they felt wronged, not because they thought he broke a law. Again, this is only the case if it's true that the allegations kept changing, but it does make ArenaNet look like they were just lashing out if true.

I really want to support Anet on this, but it’s hard to do so. They ignored and refused to believe him, and then sent police to raid him once they realized he was right. It was a crazy read that’s for sure lol.
---
Well mainly because telling the community they are "working on X" immediately gives them the expectation that X will be done at some time in the future, but as any software project goes, sometimes hurdles will come up and the entirety of the project will be scrapped, and suddenly you've "lied to the community" and need to convince them that scrapping it was the right decision, as opposed to just working on multiple projects quietly, then announcing them when you're sure they will make it to release (i.e. build templates).
---
Halloween is my favorite festival in the game! Maybe because it was the first one I experienced when I first started playing. To each their own though. I can also see why some people wouldn't like it.
---
He could have made a youtube video, he could have alerted sites like MMORPG, he could have sent out personal messages to staff at Anet, he could have done a number of things. What he choose to do was to pretend to be a person he was not to gain access to their account, he then used that account to curse, trash talk, etc to prove that the account had been Hijacked. If you don't get your point across to a person or company do you think it's ok then to pretend to be them and cause harm to the owner of those accounts? It is not ok. In fact I don't know how this isn't illegal. If I called a credit card company and pretended to be you and they gave me access to your account, you better bet that I would be sent to jail, paying fines, etc.
---
On 2:
---
It's definitely smaller than PvE by a large margin, but it's still plenty active enough to play.
---
With PvP you will find a match within a few minutes basically always. You may end up seeing the same faces a bit. Not so much wvery match, but every 2nd or 3rd match will probably have someone you played recently.
---
With WvW Zerg fights die down during night time hours but there are always enough people to accomplish *something* in a group. Even lower pop servers hit queue on a few maps Friday nights.
---
Yes they thought he broke a law, they did go after him for breaking the law he thought he broke. But apparently that isn't against the law in Germany, when finding this out I am sure their lawyer tried to then charge him with whatever else they could think up, it's not unheard of. Were they lashing out? probably. I would be pissed if I owned the company and someone did this to me and my players. Regardless of the flaws (which should be addressed and fixed) I would have gone after the person as well. They did not hire him to find flaws in their systems, he did that on his own.
---
Content =/= "stuff to do'. See Warframe, it's just not the same.
---
But he is also wrong it's just a festival, no one expected content.
---
Oh sweet. looking forward to see any major changes. Most of my friends have ditched lich runes on necro and soulbeast. Wondering if SC will come to the same conclusion.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Thank you
---
That is great enough news for me! I was worried that PvP would only have veterans left or something, ill have to give it a go when i get a little better
---
Edit:
---
Thanks you... wow me, just wow
---
Dont talk about what you are looking at, talk about what you are working on.
---
even cooler
---
I'd rather have open world pvp version of the mega server at this point with some claimable stuff. Mounts didn't kill populations and the same old maps aren't played out yet when there's action. There's no aesthetic or tonal connection to the rest of the game apart from the reward track and player vs player is a lot more fire &amp; forget passive ballast than deliberate utility, skills, and counters. 
---
You can prep all night with a squad and move everyone around but you might get one or two semi good fights before prime time fizzles out now and those fights are more like crashing into each other and one side quickly realizing they're horribly outgunned.
---
Hope you know this is a GW1 article
---
Isn't that what criminal Court is for? Civil court doesn't require a broken law.
---
Yes it will like every other outrage. You cited something not anymore as that's been fixed for a long time now. 
---
Even by the outrages narrative of "GREEDY BLIZZARD WANTS MONEY". The people claiming they disabled it are fucking idiots. You can't go shouting GREEDY BLIZZARDS WANTS MONEY and then rightfully say "Yeah they did this thing to save a couple thousand dollars but will get fined over 300,000".
---
The outrage themselves will make sure it dies out quickly because they're making themselves look like a fucking laughing stock of hysteria.
---
Yes but this requires lots of bags and bank tabs. People that buy that stuff and plays so much probably buy a lot of other stuff.
---
I should have been more specific *my* kitless build is garbage. Been experimenting with it recently and it's just not working out well. Probably going to use metabattle to find something decent at some point before I play it again.
---
yes. people will forget like every single other time anything bad happens, maybe 1 or 2 will remember but everyone else will continue on as if nothing happened. i know because i'm usually in the minority that *does* remember and it is just as frustrating each time it happens until eventually you just stop caring because it's just a waste of time.
---
Reminds me of those stories you hear of a student in high school that breaches the school network because the sysadmin didn't secure it properly, and then the school prosecutes/suspends the student instead of working with them to fix their network.  (And encourage them to continue to test their network so they can patch any security flaws)
---
This could be a good thing tbh...
---
&gt; Berserker since they aren't mentioned much when it comes to how complicated a class is.
---
Berserker isn't that hard to play in PvE, because it's usually pretty easy to avoid damage altogther, making the toughness penalty not really that important.
---
In sPvP (and roaming in WvW), you really do feel quite squishy, especially since it's actually best to use Berserker Amulet on Berserker (fitting I guess), since they are so damage-focused. In other words, a tanky Berserker would be useless since a lot of primal bursts (like the GS and Axe ones) only do damage, and that's a big deal since GS on warrior is very very strong, and you don't want your primal burst to hit like a wet noodle, so your best bet is to just run around as a melee glass cannon and use active defenses (shield 5, gs 3, endure pain, berserker stance, [feel no pain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Savage_Instinct), etc). 
---
I'm sure there are people who will say otherwise, but I have over 1.5k hours exclusively on the spec and trust me, it can be a struggle often. So much so that it's extremelyyy hard to pull off in high-level sPvP games against coordinated players.
---
TBH, robbing banks today is really hard due to the security guards and bullet proof glass around the tellers.  All the bank robbers from the Wild West really fucked up modern day bank robbers.

And i'm more than looking forward for this year, last year i had only the core version of the game, this time i have both xpacks so i'm gonna do Labyrinth with mounts and auto-loot for the first time, gonna be even better.
---
Also, one thing i have to ask, you think we'll get Unid Gear from the mobs now?? Cause if that's the case it will be sooo good for inventory managment hehe.
---
I honestly just use full exceed skills on my Holo in PvE. They're all super strong with Enhanced Capacity Storage Unit since you'll almost always be over 50 heat.
---
Ya, should have phrased it a bit better. You're not wrong.
---
Just don't have anything on your account that's worth stealing EZClap ^^^/s
---
I love collecting (hoarding?) [Queen Jennahs](https://i.imgur.com/234fByd.jpg)! I'd love to get at least 50 someday!
---
They can still be more open though.
---
There's no harm in telling us "Oh yeah, we are working on a new fractal and raid, but we don't have any release dates yet", just to let us know they are still working on it. They can say "we do have plans for a new type of content, but it's really early in development and we can't say much about it since it might not work out, or might change drastically as it develops".
---
Anet had like 300 people at the start of the year, and still has something like over 150. Yet, it sometimes feels like they are a 5 person team. I talked to the dev that designed almost every legendary weapon in the game. Why is it just one person working on so many of them? What the hell are the other 150 people doing? Just living story?
---
This is still a large team. There HAS to be more than just living story going on in that office. Nobody is looking for concrete details. Nobody is looking for release dates. Just confirmation that people are still working on the game past just living story.

cant you mount up in the labyrinth?
---
Law or contract, something that is and shouldn't be is the only way to sue and win. Not liking someone is not enough.
---
lol Just got this mini in gw1 from one of the birthday gifts :D

Tldr?

If I steal a jackson pollack painting and convince the judge it's worthless do i go free?
---
Part of being a judge surely must include the notion of "i dont understand it but i trust the claims of multiple experts who say this ~~art~~virtual property is worth what it's worth"
---
&gt;Lynie estimates he was successful in about five of his seven attempts over the course of a few months
---
5/7, this guy can't be stopped
---
Didn't we have a thread about just that the other day?
---
Not even close. This sub never knew a good party even if it ran them over with 40 roller beetles at top speeds all while drifting.
---
They'd have to go to court every week.
---
Agreed. Every game has temporary repeatable festivals. We just got spoiled because Anet DID add new content every year for a while. I've never understood the complaints...
---
&gt; (Key of Ahdashim) is relatively **low difficulty**.
---
A recurring theme of this game, sadly.
---
&gt;And the only details anet understands is lore RP references.
---
Don't be too generous with that suggestion.  They ignore tons of plot threads, and pave over with new ones.
---
I wish it was a bit more visible too, but they have to be really careful. If its too noticeable, it completely removes the usefulness of the skill. Right now, I think its a decent viability where you have to really be looking for it, but if it gets too noticeable,  like a casting animation or something, all players have to do it look for that to avoid it. I would think a way to combat that would be allowing a sorta ammo mastery where you can hold multiple spears at a time but even then.
---
yeah; 
---
- Elementalist due to low health and armor
---
- Engineer is only hard to play when trying to be "BiS" due to complicated rotation required to get the DPS; playing a flamethrower scrapper is easy as can be.
---
Obviously I want to have an army of Queen Jennahs to rule all of Tyria. :)
---
Those people crying 'drama' are just the whiteknights who want to silence anyone with information that doesn't make Arenanet look favorable.
---
Just gonna copypasta my comment from massivelyop because fuck this kid and his mindgames:
---
This kid isn’t just a black hat, he’s a *fucking sociopath.*   All the embellishment, the desire to paint himself in such an  obnoxiously innocent light, “Oh i’m just a kid who idolized Arenanet and  Guild Wars, I thought they were my heroes, i’ve played since i was 9”,  yadda yadda yadda …it’s all there, plain as text to me.  Even in his  admittance to his prior immaturity, he STILL thinks he’s hot shit.  I know a sociopath when I hear one.
---
You dragged Gaile’s account under the mud to an unnecessary extent  because you were angry.  You don’t get to use “immaturity” (or at least  not the typical definition of it) as an excuse for that; *you were 19 years old.*  19 is the age of a fully functioning young adult.  Immaturity my ASS.
---
You COULD have turned your earlier exploitation into something good  if you had just stopped while you were ahead and went to news outlets or  something earlier.  Truth is, you were starting to get high on your  newfound power and decided to continue exercising it, all under the  guise of still thinking you were helping.

The 10x recipe that occasionally gives 25 is the one that makes it "worth it" to toss orbs into the forge - and even then it's only marginal savings if you hit the average.
---
&gt;share tagging via venom
---
Doesn't work like that. When an ally applies one of your venoms, the Condi is sourced from you, which means it uses your stats, counts as your damage, and will award the kill credit to you
---
OMG 10/10 story.
---
That guard was a real hero lol
---
The problem I believe is that virtual items are notoriously hard to valuate from a legal point, aren’t they?
---
A company can hit a button and millions are made.
---
Though, my point was the same as yours, and the other was arguing that it’s hard to prove their value in court.
---
The prices tanked well before that.  The extra pressure isn't a benefit to the prices, I'll grant you that.  But it is in no way the singular cause.
---
Edit: Unless you meant that as an addition...
---
i have no idea :0
---
There was a bug going around when GW1 was a thing, on a 3rd party website, i think it was the NCSoft website ( no longer used ) but you could literally enter your details and it would log you into someone elses accounts where you could change the password, see the CD Key etc, it was reported, and it took Anet months to even acknowledge there was a problem let alone fix it, 
---
After reading that article im glad Anet lost this in court, they had it coming, he tried to warn them several times, and they didnt want to hear it, pretty much how they deal with things still to this day, they do not want to believe they have issues in their systems.
---
Well, I made the assumption 'cause you brought innocence up, but the thing is, why can't it have been both? Why do you feel his actions can only have been vindictive? 
---
Even if I'm to agree with you in claiming they *were*, and perhaps surprisingly, I would, couldn't he have done this both to get back at them and in the hope of fixing the system?
---
He reached out to Anet on numerous occasions, explaining what he did and how he did it. I don't think that should count for nothing.
---
Why are you running in circles? Seems like a you problem
---
If I may ask, why was putting your instruments in the novelties system a mistake?
---
I added mine to it as well as every other infinite toy/tonic I had on all my characters but based on the responses I'm seeing in this thread, I'm wondering if that was a bad idea?
---
What are the downsides to having musical instruments in the novelties tab vs keeping them in your inventory? I understand OP's point but I don't really see how it relates to specific items like instruments... there's no way to combine them with anything else so... what am I missing?
---
I don't want to treat the guy like a hero cause he really isn't, and let's not pretend pettiness isn't a motivator here. But fucking YIKES this is beyond embarrassing for ANet, especially given they had multiple confirmed reports of this being an issue
---
That's not really the point. If it was my account, I wouldn't want anyone else to gain access to it to prove a point—no matter the intention. If words alone were not enough to convince ArenaNet that a problem exists, that's on ArenaNet. It is not this "Lynie" person's responsibility to use other people's accounts without their permission to convince ArenaNet. If he really wanted to be considerate of others, he would have asked for cooperation before acting on his own. Not everyone wants to be forcibly dragged into something, even if they agree about the problem. That's the point.
---
It shows.
---
I mean I understand it, because my best friend worked a CS job that refused to give him time off to go to his infant niece's funeral, but I just don't *understand* it from a common sense perspective you know?
---
Practice bots might actually help us get better
---
Now try playing it in PvP
