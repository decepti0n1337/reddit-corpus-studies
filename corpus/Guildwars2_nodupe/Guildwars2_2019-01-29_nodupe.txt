Sound advice, ill wait another 10-15 to see if it gets better. Ran with guys who were full legendary armor leaving level 50s (not me) behind expecting them to run through mobs. Like communicating to a door.

---
It was 6 months, the worst part of this all is the fact that people who were affected by this were already unbanned.

&gt;unwarranted 
---

---
Id hardly call it unwarranted, cheaters were running rampant  and something needed to be done about it. the anti cheat method they used is widely used by many companies, very similar to battle eye and steam VAC. Also if you use Cheat Engine then you know that MOST anti cheat systems will flag it.   
---
Id say they could have handled it better tho. Collect the data, investigate the flagged accounts and THEN ban; rather than take longer than the suspension period to fully investigate the cases. 
---
Right? I've been playing off and on since release and only have around 5k AP. I also don't sit around all day for years grinding out arbitrary achievements that have no effect on my ability to complete certain encounters.
---
Exactly. It costs them nothing to hand out the LS episodes and gems. Literally nothing. There's no monetary compensation for being wrongly kicked out of the game for 6 months.
---
I think I'll log back in but I am certainly never spending a cent again, because if the security guy that gloated so gleefully on Twitter about these bans is still working there, I expect this BS to happen again, also with zero appeals process expect to be treated like crap still.
---
Was ANet always this bad? I came in at the launch of GW2 so never experienced them with GW1, but it seems like they just can't do anything right without shooting themselves in the foot several times and saying they didn't shoot themselves in the foot.
---
Are you okay?

In terms of how important each piece is, the importance should go in this order: Weapon &gt; Trinkets &gt; Armor. Within trinkets, prioritize amulet &gt; rings &gt; accessories &gt; backpack. Within armor, it should be chest &gt; shoulders &gt; helmet &gt; everything else. Also cool note, diviners is available as a stat on HOT stat selectable items, even though it is not a HoT stat. TL;DR: Specialization collections and crafting for weapons. Raids for armor. Tyria trinkets: fractals for backpack and rings, guild missions or living world for accessories, laurels for trinkets. Everything else: check if your stat is available on HoT stat selectable trinkets, then spam Living World Season 3 maps (episode 3: a crack in the ice is your best friend)
---
Ascended Weapon: The best way to get these is typically via the specialization collections. There's a cheap way to make at least one of the Path of Fire ones. Some come with useful stats, but some do not (none of the renegade collections come with useful stats), but you can always mystic toilet them to the right stats. This method typically requires 400 weaponsmithing, so you should at least get to there. Crafting ascended weapons is not excessively expensive either, but could be annoying when you need 3 different kinds of weapons, that may come from different professions. For crafting ascended weapons, always craft plain ascended weapons and convert them into HOT stats or POF stats, as it's much cheaper this way (same for armor).
---
Ascended Amulet: The best way to get tyria stats is to just spend Laurels. It's only 35, which means you'd have this in just 30 days of play if you don't spend it on anything else. Don't buy any other ascended pieces with laurels. You can get several ascended amulets doing achivement hunting in the story missions for both HoT and PoF for free, and it can be quite fun. Finally, check Living World Season 3 maps. I prefer Episode episode 6 as the way to get amulets.
---
Ascended Ring: Fractals are by far the best way to get tyria stats, as you only need to do 10 dailys to get each ring. If you have fractals leveled all the way to T4, you get around 15 a day if you do all the dailys, just to show how fast you can get these rings. If you need HoT stats (vipers, diviners), run living world season 3 maps, especially episode 3.
---
Ascended Accessory: Guild missions are a nice cheap way of getting tyria stat accessories. however, not every guild can get you these quickly as they may not have the levels unlocked to get many missions per week. Otherwise, your best bet is Living World Season 3 maps. You should get accessories in Episode 3 (black ice earing) and Episode 2 (sparkling petrified wood). There are some accessories you can get from Living World Season 4 although they may take longer.
---
Ascended Backpack: Fractals is probably one of the cheapest ways to get an ascended backpack, but the stats are limited to basically Berserker as the only useful stat. This typically helps you towards the legendary backpack achievement, so might as well do the work once. Otherwise, you'd want to farm Living World maps for map currency. You can get pretty neat unique skins that way too! If you can't get your stat, you can get backpacks of any stat through raids, albeit a bit pricy.
---
Doing raids is a really nice way to get ascended weapons and armor. You get drops frequently, and each time you complete a raid for the first time you are gifted rare items that can be used to craft ascended items. Raids are way more dependent on skill than gear, and you can definitely do training runs on exotics. DOING THE LEGENDARY ARMOR COLLECTION GIVES YOU **TWO** FULL SETS OF ASCENDED ARMOR. The legendary armor collection is of very little cost, and just requires you to beat all of the first 4 wings bosses. This is difficult, but with time you can get it. While you are practicing and getting to this, you will likely get enough magnetite shards to straight up buy ascended gear.
---
Which instance is that?
---
&gt;when I map completed on my (basic) thief long ago, because nothing could hit me due to blind.
---
To be fair, are you really ever in threat of dying in core maps? Unless you pull Veterans or something.
---
I feel you'd have to literally AFK to die to normal monsters.
---
No. But that's beside the point.
---
You sound like a fun person to raid with, reading your comment alone makes me want to go and raid with people just like you! /s
---
I really feel you on this...been playing solo since I first started, always wanted to play with others. I dont really like big guilds and stuff, they dont really appeal to me and feel impersonal.
---
If you want an in game friend or something, im totally down so hmu
---
Doesn't say I'm wrong. It's a word in a dictionary that nowhere mentions misspelling. What it says is that most people know the word regardless and think it doesn't make sense to put a negative suffix in front and mean the same thing (which I agree with).
---
But it's still a word, in a dictionary. And it still means regardless, even if we don't like it and would rather people not say it. 
---
Drop that attitude and next time dont answer me with “Absolutly not” if you are remotly aware of it
---
You can't make legendary ones, tho. And even those take ages.

From the bottom of my heart: Go fuck yourself.

Chrono gives quickness and alacrity and is the main boon support class. Imo its finicky though.

Renegade can heal and give permanent alacrity and other boons.

Firebrand can give permanent quickness easily

Druid can heal with great offensive buffs

Warrior has banners for offensive buffs

Scourge can heal and give health barriers.

Anet did it what, 5 years, into the life of GW2, clearly it wasn't standard for anet. And feedback I saw from cheat engine users wasn't that they habitually turned it off when playing online games.
---
Wow that is a LOT of faking in the comments. Now I almost feel bad about faking qadin kp because I have no static AND did not kill it from week one on. I wont tell you not to fake LI or KP. Without a group of friends, a guild or any number of dhuum/qadim kp, you will have a rocky and frustrating start into what I consider some of GW2s best moments you can have in PvE. Let me instead try to give you actual advice: 
---
Wing 1 and Wing 4 are very beginner friendly up to the final bosses. Many PUG commanders actually stopped asking for kill proof for those. Try your feet in some of those groups until you can actually do damage while staying alive. Then try to get some experience in Wing 2 and 3. This will unlock your envoy armor. I would consider Wing 6 easier than wing 5 but that might be personal taste. Both wings have bosses, where your dragonhunter wont cut it any more though. Feel free to try w5 river, statues and dhuum or w6 conjured amalgate and qadim at some point, but its best to be experienced before as these encounters are littered with mechanics, colors and particles.
---
Thank god she died. Not that I disliked Aurene, I liked her, but that fight was too motonone for it to end with aurene somehow winning over Kralk
---
I see in the install instructions (holy moly someone actually reads those!) that we need to disable all overlay software. Im guessing this includes the Nvidia recording overlay thats part of Geforce Experience?  I read a post here that said someone was still able to record using it, so im a bit confused on if it needs to be disabled or not.
---
It took me a minute at most to finish the achievement 5 times. Use artificer to combine the luck. 
---
The people praising Anet for giving the banned players some gems (as if that's gonna make up for a 9 month suspension) are the same ones that will mock and belittle you regardless if you were falsely punished or not. This incident and the kung fu tea fiasco probably made more people wary that false bans do happen, but the brainless white knights will keep doing their thing.
---
It's a hilarious slam-dunk when they provide adequate evidence, but everyone should know by now that ANet has an ugly history of unjustified trigger pulls on bans.
---
If they're trying to regain their image, that's a good thing.  But it's something to keep in mind.
---
He's a troll. I've seen him like this on other threads.
---
Hmmm, the instructions say to disable all overlay software... would have thought that shadowplay would fall into that category. 
---
&gt; I reached out to support on twitter and reddit to get attention for this and all I got was an acknowledgement that they don't know why I was banned.
---
Probably because the people who run the Twitter aren't the same that ban accounts, or answer support tickets.
---
Given the fact that I've seen all of this in t4 PUGs:
---
- bearbow who didn't know how to do Mai Trin at all
---
- mirage who INSISTED boons aren't necessary and me being chrono is a waste (pre-SOI nerf even)
---
- 2 soulbeasts and a deadeye who refused to be in melee range at all throughout uncategorized
---
- 4 people who didn't understand that I cannot be the only one picking up the hammer in Cliffside
---
T4 PUGs are not the best way to ensure highly skilled players. You need a static for that. 
---
The Necropolis one is even worse considering you will likely have to do it multiple times for various things like the Griffon
---
I think I've only seen it once where Lyte admitted the ban was unfair and reversed it 
---
The two halves of your sentence do not relate to each other
---
This your first time starting the game, or have you played from that computer before?
---
the don't have souls. dragons aren't beings so much as forces of nature. they have a soul as much as a tornado or a tsunami have souls
---
Well you might not be in threat of dy
---
ing but normally at least you can get hit.   With AOE blind it makes it even more ridiculous.   Maybe at best a ranged attacker can land a blow before you walk up and aoe blind if you're particularly slow. 
---
Agreed. I saw this post before Pugging my T4s yesterday. I was a little worried at first 'cause sometimes instabilities can stack kinda silly. We had a good DH, an ok reaper, a reaper who did less damage than my Chrono and a Druid. Cleared it with minimal difficulty. I changed my build to clear boons on shatter and ran Well of Eternity to clear conditions on group for the last boss. 
---
People are still learning the mechanics though. It's Puddles off boss, Sharks on group people!

using Properties &gt; Compatability &gt; Change high DPI settings, I can get it to scale so all the text shows up but then it becomes blurry. Otherwise any combination of settings results in clipping like before: https://imgur.com/a/ipvmJ1U

I'll just live with the clipping for now :)

I have played from this computer since 2015. I went on a bit of a hiatus a year ago and recently wanted to start back up, but I cannot download anything. Any time I try to launch I get the error.
---
I can only imagine they want to use up a crudton of exo essences for the silvers. I have a load but atm I cba to do simply because of the sheer amount of clicking.
---
OP, just want to say I'm both impressed and thankful for your perseverance. You were faced with a problem and painstakingly got to the bottom of it. I think there's a lot of good information that came out of this, and going forward the game will be better for it. I think in your shoes I would've also chosen to step away completely, but I'm still optimistic about the future of GW2.
---
You are talking about the exotics. Heroic Dragonsblood are the ascended.
---
First off, well done on your perseverance &amp; congratulations on seeing this matter through to its conclusion. 
---
I can't help but think that a cock-up of this magnitude, coupled with the (at best) questionable method of gathering customers' usage data, somebody's job should be on the line for this. I'm astonished a company like Anet, who otherwise seem (to me, at least) of keeping a good relationship with customers, would let this happen in their name.
---
lol that means ANET lied to me in my GDPR request because they told me they didn't store them
---
Getting Anet coins is not real world currency.
---
Fml. Thanks for the answer
---
fixed the directory issue and confirmed launching and closing GW2 works
---
added new image to imgur album - i can't seem to escape the blur :( oh well
---
also my API key has full perms but checking the box for "Raid Currency" results in a "ERROR: Your API key is not valid" message.
---
Some of them are smart enough, some of them are not.  It also requires your commander to be observant enough to see who is helping to clear shards and who isn't, and judge dps accordingly.  Like I said, you get a player to ping a ton of LI, and then you just trust that they are doing the right things.  I'm not saying its a good system, its a lazy system that is just playing averages rather than actually evaluating players.  When my static fills a vacant slot with a pug, we don't ask them to ping anything, because we are able to see pretty clearly if they know what they are doing.  
---
But that can't be true as Glint is currently a dead dragon soul occupying the mists. And it's been established that regular dragons can become elder dragons, so there can't be that much of a distinction. 
---
Unlike tornadoes and tsunamis dragons appear to be sentient, even sapient. I also refuse to believe Aurene is soulless (in the context of the gw2 universe, anyway)
---
Which job would you recommend for making gold then? I've been using Armorsmith and Weaponsmith, but I haven't dipped into the other crafting professions yet.  
---
Is that JiL? 
---
try a vpn to see if it a routing issue by your isp, if that is still not working then could be some old cache issue?
---
while I agree ranger is easy, Longbow is actually one of the weakest ranged weapons in ranger hands (ironically). Even dragonhunter does better with it.
---
Oh well, more bugs to fix, I'll have to google what causes the blur and I'll get it fixed. Currency should work if loading bosses work, that's weird. As long as you have characters (for lis) and wallet (for magnetites) permissions on that key.  
---
  
---
Thank you for testing this, btw. I really appreciate the feedback.

Core Guardian with radiance, zeal and virtues - you can gear for power, vitality and toughess and still have 80% crit chance with 220+% cirt dmg due to all the traits related to retaliation.
---
Awesome thanks so much for this info. I can’t believe it only takes 24 hours to hit max level. That’s like no time at all
---
Probably burn out and lack of content to go through, happens with lots of games
---
To be clear about something: they did say in the e-mail to the guy finally caught their problem (see here https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/) that they were taking steps to make sure this false flag doesn't happen again.
---
However, the bigger reason that this stuff keeps happening is that there seems to be a problem with their attitude or approach to discipline issues. From official responses like this one (this is actually the best one I've seen and breaks the trend) to devs who come on here and deal with individual cases to their entire "no appeal is allowed" system, they show time and time again that they don't seem to really acknowledge that they can make mistakes. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes of course and could be wrong, but I think the biggest thing that needs to change is for them to be more willing to consider that their system or algorithms or CR reps or whatever else are not as well designed or implemented or trained or whatever as they need to be, and to work to improve the reticence to acknowledge that. Nothing is every going to be perfect, so algorithms will probably always detect false flags, but that wouldn't be as big a deal if the company had a better attitude about being willing to accept or admit that they may detect false flags and being more willing to dig into this stuff without needing some IT security expert to literally do it for them. THAT is the problem, not some individual detection software.
---
Trying not to be all negative and all but... This is really depressing to read
---
I used to do T1 learning runs while doing Ad Infinitum collection. One semi exp T1 guy got impatient of me explaining mechanics to newbies because he has done it before. I told him this is a learning run and people are trying to learn.  He shut up afterwards but still stuck around getting pissed occasionally &gt;_&gt;

Sandswept Isles with the third tier of karma retribution, especially the specimen chamber meta (xx:45 every two hours). Takes like 10 minutes for easy 30k-45k karma if you have a good tagging class like Thief Shortbow/Staff Necro/Flamethrower Engi.
---
You should mention if EU or NA.
---
This is a problem with downloading updates, right?
---
I still want those hairstyles ingame, anet plz.
---
Ugh so much about the HoT plot and design was bad.
---
Caithe's motives were poorly explained (I still hate everything about Caithe to be honest). Eir was killed to make Vinetooths (Vineteeth?) look scary even though they hardly appear and aren't that bad; this also gave Braham another sob story in a story that was speeding by too quickly to care. 
---
They had an interesting plot point with sylvari but just sweep it aside. In LW Season 2 and the HoT trailer this was a HUGE plot point. Laranthir, Caithe, hell Trahearne is plugged into the fucking dragon but they're just "strong enough" to withstand it?? There's like two events and one story mission which touch on it SLIGHTLY. They scrapped the story of the Mordrem commanders entirely.
---
You stumble onto how to kill an Elder Dragon and then kinda just...do it. The DS boss battle (keep in mind, that whole map was conceived - let alone rushed - not long before release) and it is much more memorable. What does the Mouth of Mordremoth look like? Well it's like an infinitely long, pug-faced snake! And the actual Mordremoth? Well it's just like this...humanoid thing with a weird, fat belly...? And its attacks are really generic. But yeah the Zhaitan one was worse.
---
Same here. RNG follows me everywhere xD
---
Maybe the issue is in the game files as a whole thats blocking the progress somewhere. If you havent tried already, try to repair the game files (if it lets you that is).

---
Im not sure if the game will even let you repair if it wont even begin a download, but its definitely worth a try. Ive had similar errors, and this typically fixes it
---
Lyte is a tool.
---
Notice how only one is a full stack. They are all the same stack, just broken down.
---
Another keylogger I bet
---
to be fair, not many people have tc instances or offer LFGs for tc. Most people only do that if they manage to beat KC (a relatively hard boss) and want to try to beat Xera (also a hard boss) and if they know how to do both, then they probably are exp enough to just run past TC.
---
Just join training runs for Cairn and VG because they happen all the time. Cairn leads directly to MO, and VG leads to Spirit Woods, and Escort is the first. This will get you plenty of experience playing your class. Trio is easy, but not many people have trio instances, because Sloth is not an easy boss.

Here are some tips I learnt to make ascended crafting easier:
---
•	Season 3 and Season 4 living story areas are the best areas to get ascended materials.  These maps have lots of crafting nodes as well provide unbound/volatile magic.  
---
•	Unbound magic can be traded for magic packet that have a fairly decent percentage to drop an ascended crafting material.  
---
•	Volatile magic can be traded for shipment items that drop hundreds of basic crafting materials.  
---
•	The 30 day ascended crafting login reward provides a vision crystal and 2 random ascended materials.  
---
•	The quickest way to get ascended jewellery is via laurels.  Lake Doric, Bitterfrost Frontier, Sandswept Isle and Fractals are alternatives to this process.  
---
•	The easiest ascended way to obtain an ascended back piece is via Bitterfrost Frontier or the Rising Sunspear Banner collection.  
---
•	The easiest way to get an ascended underwater breather via Swim Speed infusions.  You can buy them on the Trading Post for gold and trade them in for an ascended underwater breather.  Bitterfrost Frontier is an alternative to this process.  
---
•	If you craft an ascended item with the “wrong stats”, you can easily change it to a different stat via a Mystic Forge recipe (which is very cheap).  You can use this process to get more expensive stats for a cheaper material cost.  
---
•	If you want to craft Deldrimor Steel and don’t have enough iron, try exploring the top left corner of the Brisbane Wildlands.  
---
•	If you want to craft any sort of ascended leather item, volatile magic is the easiest way to do this.  
---
•	Changing the appearance of a “crafted ascended weapon” permanently changes the name.  For example if I change the appearance of “Stonecleaver’s Reaver” and then change it back to its original appearance, the item will be called “Crimson Antique Axe” not “Stonecleaver’s Reaver”.  The only way to restore the original name is via the Mystic Forge stat changing recipe.  
---
I’ve had someone give me shit for playing staff tempest solo roaming just taking a camp (which melts like butter with staff).  Well I should say they started talking shit about how Weaver sucks and someone else at the camp told them I was a tempest build, not a weaver.   It was just 4 people standing there waiting for RI to wear off.  I’m surprised they didn’t talk shit about my gathering tools tbh.

I only got a month due to some bullshit excuse from them, they only answered my tickets after a month, I don't want gems but I rather want an apology. I had to deal with lots of bullshit from them and insistence for a month or more so afterward to get stuff back they removed, always dodging my questions, but doing what I bloody asked in restoring my gold they removed for no reason and proof.
---
We're hanging that on the fridge honey.

All day long, I keep seeing this post's thumb as a portrait of a violet beetle...

-repair does not work, I still get the same connection error.
---
This is what has frustrated me with Anet over the past year or so.  Everything on their schedule seems to be about expanding LW and PvE content.  I get some of these tasks we want are monumental in size but man, increasing performance for a huge portion of the community isn't high on the list?  Just sad, really.
---
I don't think that one's too bad. Not particularly fun, but quick enough to complete.
---
I actually kind of like that. You are a part of the pact but not the pact. They can succeed without you now. I think that's an interesting take on the whole chosen hero saving the world thing. 
---
What the hell is wrong with its head?
---
Because you are supposed to dodge to put them onto your enemies.
---
Hmm... I'm not one to shit on others art cause I'm no good, but something with this just feels off... especially her head. 
---
Keep at it and you'll have something real special here :-)
---
If you don't do it already, start opening all loot bags on a lvl 50 char and salvage there, you'll get plenty iron and plat. Maybe not all you'll ever need but it's def worth it, even just selling and buying other mats you need.
---
give them more rewards Anet like , Innocent victim "Title"
---
Er.... nothing. It's tipped to the side. It may be that I have the bad habit of drawing my character's heads too small. Partially in the fear of drawing their heads too big.
---
I would go druid and get a second set for slb later. 
---
When the game came out, the final fight was one that bothered a lot of people.  It was built up so much and then the fight itself was so underwhelming so you're not alone.  Anet's story telling has gotten a lot better over the years but they've also thrown in a LOT of money for it too.
---
Might've made her head a tad bit too small. A bad habit of mine. 
---
It looks like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512LWociUjL._SX425_.jpg)

Ahh keep at it! :-)

  What about this? Didnt see netsh winsock on your list, but maybe youve tried it
---
This usually indicates a problem connecting to our download servers. You should begin by resetting your network adapter:
---
1. Click the "Start" button or press the Windows key to bring up the Start Menu.
---
2. Type **CMD** into the "Search programs and files" field, but *do not* hit enter.
---
3. When the **Command Prompt** (or **cmd.exe**) program is displayed in your search bar, right-click the program and select "Run as Administrator." Press **Yes** if prompted to let the program make changes to your computer.
---
4. A command prompt window will open. Type **netsh winsock reset** into the window, and then press **Enter** to execute the command.
---
5. When the command is completed successfully, a confirmation will appear followed by a new command prompt line.
---
6. Launch *Guild Wars 2* and try connecting to the game.
---
I know after the incident he deleted his "anime posts pics" on twitter then deleted his reddit twitter afterwards in the banwave aftermath, I know he also deleted something on the JP incident and went really silent
---
Blue Oozes also spawn form health loss. It's just smaller intervals and why they heal less.
---
&gt;  Buffy follows Buffy's rules, but Guild Wars follows Guild Wars' rules. 
---
The writing in GW2? Take a good look at it. It was obviously done by huge Buffy fans. The game could be called *Buffy the Elder Dragon Slayer*
---
Well, and updrafts, which you need on some of the HoT and LWS3 maps at times. But yeah.
---
Any heart that involves dredge is pretty bad tbh, mostly because fuck the dredge.
---
It sure is that they link you only one full stack, and the rest are increasingly smaller stacks.
---
It's almost like they know they look like an idiot and are trying to save face by hoping you'll admit defeat by breaking their stack up.
---
&gt; But what can they do? It is a video game. Do they give you thousands of dollars? Do they buy you a car? What can they do?
---
Investigate in a timely manner for one thing.
---
I want to give you a big **thank you** for persevering in this and giving some insight on what happened, as I myself was unsuccessful in getting anything information from ANet regarding this despite my efforts.
---
Now in my case, I had two accounts that were wrongfully suspended so I got a total of 5k gems between them, and while it's nice, it can't possibly make up for both the time lost playing the game and the way they treated those of us that were falsely accused. That said, I've moved on from being angry at this a while ago; mostly I'm just disappointed. Maybe one day I'll be able to play this game and actually enjoy it again, but not right now.
---
Tell ESO players that.  LOL, Kubernetes, you're funny.
---
Can't roll back time.  Next.
---
Well, they're getting apologies, just not public ones I guess.  What went wrong is "technology is hard and mistakes happen."
---
A good public explanation and promises of future forbearance would probably go a long way.

There are a bunch of centaurs right behind the monastery that are not tied to any event.
---
My Main was a Tribute to Eir so Ranger thematically in game.
---
Mesmer for mechanics and gameplay.
---
MIGHT MAKES RIGHT!
---
Oh dude, in case you haven't figured out. Hit the gear icon in your inventory&gt;Deposit all collectibles. They'll go to special storage in your bank tab and free up your inventory significantly :) (Max stack 250 per material unless you buy upgrades. But you can refine those materials into higher tier mats that also take 250 slots lmao)
---
They took responsibility. They apologized for their mistake. They gave you in game story content (some which is locked behind a paywall for missing it) and gems to spend as you please.
---
One of the many reasons I love this game and the company that runs it. They're not perfect, but they're far from the money hungry companies that run games these days.
---
Huh. I got lucky I guess. Decided it was time to do it, went on LFG, found a squad, bam. Maybe it helped to be doing it on a weekend right after a holiday when everyone was getting back into the game. Seemed like most of the events required for griffin had a bunch of people ready to jump in. The hardest one was the one where you help that guy storm the Deadhouse, at least when I was working on it.
---
I'm trying to think what path of Catacombs requires some bundle weapon and I am drawing a blank.
---
In PvP, no, the names of minions, pets, and clones show up all the time because they're enemies.  It's an all or nothing sort of deal.  Squad and party are the same, I believe in squad only the names of your subsquad are shown unless the player isn't loaded, then it's just their name.
---
However, in options, in User interface, there's several options.  Pets, clones, and minions are NPCs, so in PvE at least, you should be able to uncheck 'show all NPC names' to at least disable those.
---
This guy griffons. Some of those videos are ridiculous.

Fractals and PvP gear boxes (high magic find as possible)

With regards to Mordremoth and Dragon's Stand, I literally finished Heart of Thorns last night and also felt it was anti-climactic. Then someone told me to participate in the meta to supplement it and I was pretty excited to try it, but I guess I was too new and didnt understand the mechanics very well and kept getting yelled at, called out and insulted by a bunch of toxic players...so I just left the map to do other stuff and it pretty much tainted me from trying it again. :(
---
Personally I feel that 2500 gems is too small of a "oops we borked up" recompensation.
---
Elementalist because I can pretend to be Storm or the Avatar depending on my mood. Also it's a caster, and I love casters, and of the casters in this game it feels the most "naturey." I know there's Druid, but it's just not the same. Ele feels more "primal naturey" before life began.
---
Guardian is second cuz it's fun and I like to pretend my toon is some brave knight prince ~~who sometimes wears pit fighter armor to show off his amazing six pack~~.
---
Np, glad it worked. Do give your isp a call if it keeps happening then as it seems your conn is just failing somewhere between you and anet servers, you can trace the route and see where/what and tell them etc if you care to investigate further.
---
valid points, but if you put an lfg like, 'trio, need opener', you have a decent shot at getting one during good hours.  
---
nono he's an elitist so he meant Danmaku 
---
It seems to be one of the main abilities of Kralkatorrik. He, Glint, Vlast and Aurene have all had prophetic visions. But how he couldn't foresee something as noticeable as a mountain falling on his head beats me. It must be more like a Doctor Strange-esque "possibility calculation" ability where the future foreseen is likely but not guaranteed.
---
1. Buy comm tag  
---
2. open lfg, advertise with lerooooooy jenkins hall of chains

I am never gonna be able to get it lel.... so jelly :P
---
Constructive criticism is useful. This is not. 
---
I read the first couple sentences of the original post in my head in Drooburt's voice (doesn't he refer to himself in the third person?) but reading this one in Drooburt's voice is somewhat disconcerting.
---
&gt;I know people who made entirely new accounts and already have far more progress than their account that was banned.
---
Sounds like they didn't play their first account all that much then.
---
After having read the full text, while being not much for losing your account all that time it’s it still quite impressive for the devs to reconcile with you like this. If I had received anything similar back in the day I would of likely kept playing all these years. Shame the response you got seems to be unlikely for the majority of the player base. 
---
This just makes me angry. The fact that they can be that sloppy in their cheat detection, and that resistant to investigating the possibility that they had false positives just makes me scared to spend more time and money on gw2. Personally, the only interaction I have had with Anet support was pleasant, but knowing that I could get banned for something like having an empty file on my computer and then practically zero chance at review will always be at the back of my mind. There was a previous incident where someone was banned for running around on a mount harvesting nodes, supposedly for harvesting faster than legitimately possible. 
---
What I find missing from the Anet comms I have seen so far is what processes they are putting in to prevent false positives in the future. What have they learned from this? What assurance do we as legitimate players have that we wont get a "no appeals" ban due to sloppy cheat detection in the future.
---
"/u/deadenddealer" name checks out.
---
This was a pathetic final fight even upon release. Everyone was disappointed. “Press 2 to kill” was a meme for a long time. Keep going though. They really picked themselves up as far as final confrontations go. HoT was still a miss, but there are many great big boss encounters that have been added.
---
When you start the collection you can find griffin roosts on the map that allow you to mount up to explore. Finishing the collection will require 250g to be able to summon it on your own away from the roosts.
---
It’s not that Zhaitan was already hurt before the fight. It’s that we pressed a button to kill it and had a deus ex machina ending. The mechanics just weren’t there and the story ended on a flat note. That’s what the problem was, not necessarily that it was easy.
---
&gt;2,500 gems
---
... Can I get banned too? I want free gems, too. 
---
Like many others below, thank you for your persistence on this matter and diving deep into this matter! To me, bringing this to light provided me with some closure.
---
&gt;They think that they can skip mechanics in T3 and in fact end up causing a party wipe and leaving shortly afterwards by throwing a fit. Especially when there are also disgusting combinations of instabilities.
---
Just burst the boss! It doesn't matter if your group doesn't have the DPS or if the instabilities can insta-kill you or if you already tried bursting it down 5 times and it didn't work out! It's about going fast! Burst! Burst it all! Gotta go fast!
---
... Some people are so hung up on downing a boss in 30secs, even if it takes 30 minutes for it to happen. It's mind-bogglingly stupid at times.
---
HoT was still a miss for me. Dumpy Morty isn’t impressive in the slightest.
---
This pretty much summarizes how I feel as well, heh.
---
No gold, no legendary.  I did get gems, living story unlocks and an apology.
---
Well, something, at least!
---
Unrelated issue but yes! This is me! I haven’t played seriously since the first year of release when I was banned for having a gem payment blocked by my bank. I wasn’t able to have any discussion about it, just straight up banned without any response. After a while of hoping it would get sorted I realised it wouldn’t and just stopped playing. Having spent a decent amount of money I just couldn’t restart.. Trying the free to play version confirmed this for me. Shame because GW2 and DayZ were the two main reasons I got my pc and it was my first mmo lol. I got rekt. 
---
&gt; It took me a whole minute to find out that they fucked up badly. As I have been dealing with MD5 a lot I recognized that hash: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e  
---
It's what you get when you hash an empty file or string.  
---
How does this not result in the entire player base getting banned?
---
Please do this. Ignoring or strong arming on GDPR goes completely against the spirit of the law and will be punished by the proper agencies!
---
seems legit
---
*X Doubt*
---
" The sheer amount of grind required"
---
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but that is not grind at all, that was just playing the game, with a bit of time investment in it.
---
once you decide to go for legendary armor, we can talk about what grind truly means !
---
I know he / she is actually just trolling, but it would be so hilarious if it happens. 😂
---
Yep.  As I had said before, the vindication of being proved innocent afer all the accusations was the best part.  Gems are good, the apology is best.  I do hope they learn from this and listen to people like me in the future.  
---
Save your gems for shinies in episode 6 or LS5. :p
---
It doesn't really give you enough to dive, at least not in my experience. What I do is high jump springer, bond of faith at the peak, and glide asap (you can't glide at the peak of bond of faith b/c of the gliding disabled), then mount up to griffon.
---
&gt; Also thank you satan for adding birds as an instability, you prick.
---
THIS SO MUCH. It's my most hated instability after Slippery Slope. To be clear SS isn't "hard" but it's not worth risking RSI. 
---
Birds sound fine *in theory.* Honestly do Anet even play their own game? There are many instances where players can't dodge: Underground Facility panels, Aetherblade laser panels, Chaos glowy panels, Siren Reef cannons (to an extent), Siren's Reef maze (might dodge into detection circle). 
---
Let's not forget how long the birds keep us in combat after dodging too. Way to waste a heal &gt;_&gt;
---
Great job with your efforts! I’m glad they eventually realized their mistake, but it seems ridiculous that it even happened. I received a three-month ban a year ago because I went afk during the Wintersday bell choir event - they assumed I was botting and flat out refused to believe otherwise - so I can understand how frustrating it must have been. 
---
This
---
Hmm so there is another one ... there is another problematic one in the sauna room.
---
I notice you didn't bother refuting the ship section, because there's really no defending it.  It's not fun doing the same fight three times in a row.  The bosses are all pretty much the same mechanics, don't stand in cone, don't get blown off, kill trash.  Killing one, having to take a break to do cannons and treasure, killing another, breaking to do cannons and treasure, and then killing another one... what's fun about that?  It's slow and tedious and repetitive, even if you know how to do it properly.
---
Hey now, he could be bi.  Or just Logansexual.  That said, always get a kick out of your comics, looking forward to next Monday!
---
I'm just waiting for a special day with birds+awkward+slippery :)
---
Bruh they banned me in the first year of release because my bank needed verification of a gem purchase. Spent around £100 in total on the game then them banned me for that and I never got a response. I would just recommend not spending anymore money than you already have. 
---
Most expensive game I’ve never played.  
---
Awesome. Thank you. 
---
Yeah but statistically you should.
---
They dont dedicate the resources necessary to have accurate banwaves and properly investigate appeals. It's a choice made because they dont care.
---
Nuu dont poke fun at my spelling errors 😫😫😫
---
That post is actually unbelievable. When this happened to me I had no idea what to do, I literally bought my pc for gw2 and DayZ and it was my first mmo. I had no idea what to do about it. Thankfully that guy did and he actually got the better of them. I still want my £100 back though..
---
Not just based on race, also takes into account the slider size during character creation.  Everything will also change if you use a makeover kit.
---
Is that one in the room with the Fans? I had that happened to me once too, it keeps telling me this direction, but I can't walk through walls!!
---
I don't believe it but considering we haven't gotten anything exciting lately I'm hopeful
---
Double Dragon
---
If you could choose between doing it stealthily OR fighting the pirates that would be okay, but even if you pop detectors and kill the pirates to attempt to clear the way, they respawn so fast you're wasting your time.  It could be a viable strategy to pop them on purpose so that you could stack and kill and then just have an easy game of catch but the detectors take up the entire hallway and are unrelenting.  There should be more spots in the hallway you can hide in, if the circles are going to be that big (looking at you crumbled wall with an invisible barrier over it...)
---
There's a surprising number of people saying they also got the email. I dont think the number is miniscule.
---
Yeah, the secluded part of the room where you have zero reason to go to other than the chests.
---
Not all super heroes wear capes. Hats off to you my good person!
---
&gt; Can you give me the serial code for a game you purchased in 1998? 
---
I still have my Quake CDs so sure.
---
I also have a .txt file with about 2 dozen other serial codes, including gw2.
---
It's going to happen again, and with the ways companies are getting lately it's probably going to get a lot more common. Companies can't help themselves when it comes to sticking their collective noses in where they doesn't belong. It's one thing to check what's interacting with the game itself, i.e. Taco and the like, and a totally other thing to just wholesale scan everything that's running even if it's not hooked into the game itself. Until they're up against regulation that prevents them from doing it they're going to keep doing it.
---
He's some sort of analyst atm, but I'd say his job is definitely in jeopardy with how this all turned out. The other thread shows that it was just sheer incompetence that led to this.
---
I was just speaking from personal experience with a majority of groups I've joined like that -- of course there are exceptions, if the statement doesn't apply to you there's no need to get defensive.  Most pug leaders who post huge LI requirements are terrible.

Thank you for more useful feedback than what /u/Beta_Ace_X provided, but I left it up since it seemed to greatly annoy him ;)
---
People don't do things as properly any more.
---
I don’t know since I was kicked off the game by the devs but it seems like the community are either the nicest people you’ll ever meet, or the worst..
---
If you craft every single part using buy orders only then yes. If you buy instantly and buy the insignias/ armor padding instead of crafting them the price will double. Guess it's a matter of how much patience you have to get the absolute cheapest price.
---
It's right to resist it, for a time, but you should also understand that [this is nothing new](https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/430611). 
---
lol idiots. blocking them was the best move.
---
I used to play a lot of s/d thief in WvW and it was among the most fun I've ever had with PvP in any game. d/p has always had a lot of "outplay potential" with backstab builds, but it's pretty boring, low-risk, and one-dimensional (and I don't think it's fun to play against at all). But s/d is like chess. The combination of stealth, evade, CC, and boon strip (plus utilities) is a really fun playstyle that imo fits the thief better than any other weapon. When you win a 1v3 in WvW by playing smart, you feel like a genius.
---
For most pieces, I'd rather have a texture rework to update them to handle dyes better. Some very nice pieces just look way wrong compared to new ones, in the same dyes.
---
Zhaitan is the most boring fight ever, try the expansions fight, now THAT's funny and challenging.
---
I agree with this too, some of the older sets have weird properties when mixed with certain dyes, some too glossy some way too matte. 
---
It costs that piece 68 gold instead of 42 if you buy everything off the tp for instant buy prices. Granted that's not double, but I was using that term loosely anyways. Other pieces have sharper inclines too. The zojja chest piece costs 48 gold crafting and placing buy orders but buying it all outright it goes up to 80 gold for it. It may not be exactly double but getting a full set for 200 gold is gonna require a lot of patience to get those prices and materials
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that doesn't understand these at all
---
Calculus because I have to study more than an hour. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
He meant a job in real life. Since you guys buy gold in real money you can compare $ per hour grinding silverwastes vs how much you typically make. Since I don’t enjoy grinding silver wastes and prefer to work for collections and such this is something I consider a lot (but haven’t actually bought gold yet).
---
At the secret garden of flax under jaka itzel.
---
The fastest route to getting fully ascended gear without spending money is to complete the envoy 1 collection
---
Anet did this when the game first launched. There’s some old threads on this sub with links and pics to/of the official forums and stuff. 
---
The point of instabilities is to play around them. That argument is bullshit when players' hands are tied down by mechanics. A lose-lose situation is never fun. 
---
If you haven't already, bind ALL the Griffon abilities. They can share the keys of on-foot only binds (e.g. weapons). You'll get a massive increase to control, thus more speed &amp; enjoyment. :D
---
"Super quickly" for shattered observatory is very generous, but I'm willing to give it a pass as it's Mr 100 right now and traditionally the "capstone" fractals have always been more of a project than the others.  Thaumanova I'd equate to cliffside, it's not one of the shortest but it's also not that long, and the content is at least varied.  Each room has a different task you do, and the tasks are different and require different strategies.  Tell me again what great new game play experiences we're getting from doing the same stuff three times over at the end of Siren's Reef?
---
Just like when we all thought the "screenshots" of mounts that were "never" going to happen was some guy trolling.
---
Always take leaks with a grain of salt. But you never know.
---
It's not a lose-lose, and it's not bullshit. You CAN dodge it off easily and it's a team sport. So you bring things to help mitigate it. You just have to time your dodges, especially in Siren's Reef. Kill two birds with one stone.
---
Druid/Chrono and Firebrand/Revenenant combos seem to work fine still.
---
Lol and even with the easy mode a guy died haha. I hope this gets fixed.
---
Isn’t that illegal? Might want to take some legal action if so.
---
Not gonna happen. Excuse: no money. 
---
What kind of shit post is this? You got trolled once and had a bad run and blame the system on an entire people who don't speak the same language as you? Get a grip.
---
&gt;	Fractal Reset
---
Can you elaborate? Did they reset your level to zero or something?
---
2,500 Gems for 9 months ban lmao that's a joke
---
People don’t go LA in for Raids, and also whenever people don’t know what you’re talking about they tend to ask “what is a PUG?”
---
“What’s 250 LI?”
---
And in that case it’s better to explain so that it can become a teaching moment 
---
Free access to any future release related to gw2 should be the least they give, this is ridiculously bad
---
&gt; For Mordremoth.. we just kinda flew in, jumped into his brain and killed him. Yeah there is the meta event that is pretty epic to supplement it though, but it is very very easy to completely miss since you can do Zero of dragon's stand and finish the story. Which might color my experience some because that's exactly what I did
---
Have to disagree with this part. We don't "just fly in", we try to, but get rekt af. Then we have to regroup on the ground and make our way through three hard terrain regions (VB-&gt;AB-&gt;TD) into DS, wage a 3-front offensive to finally get to the gates of Mordremoth's lair, the Blighting Towers, which are harder than the final boss himself, before finally getting Mordremoth, how makes Zhaitan look like a flea and takes 30+ players to kill. There was urgency and tension in parts of it, like VB before and during night fall, and DS Blighting Towers that were very fail-able. AB by contrast was more relaxed and non-urgent, while TD was tense but also not urgent.
---
The main issue with Mordremoth is, as you say, players can do the final story instance where you kill his mind before you kill his body in the map meta. That's problematic. Ideally they would have found a way to ensure you kill his body first before killing his mind. 
---
The hardcore option would have been to keep the final story instance locked until you complete the meta event, but given that the meta event was not easy, that was a non-starter for this level of PvE content.
---
Another option would have been to have shown at the start of the final story instance, a cinematic showing the pact killing Mordremoth's body and then you gathering a group of hero's to finish off it's mind. Then of course, you can relive the body killing campaign any time you want by doing the map meta. That probably would have been the least frustrating way to have done it.
---
&gt;For Balthazar we just... decide we're going to kill him this time. He kicked our asses 3 times in a row and we decide we're just going to kill him this time. Luckily RytlockExMachina gives us a sword that has all these super abilities never addressed before that lets us kill him.
---
Yeah agree with this one, Balthazar was pretty weak sauce, though I chalked it up to him having to fight both a dragon kill and an actual elder dragon at the same time. That was fun. Would have been nice if Kralk was positioned behind the platform where we could see him more fully, as you say, but oh well.
---
As a fellow casual player who's still working on getting the money together - what was your way of doing so?
---
Is it better to make the Grandmaster Marks for ascended gear than to craft the pieces using the recipes? Obviously I need the pages but it seems a bit less costly in terms of materials needed. Am I correct in thinking that?
---
You're correct. Buy order do save quite a lot of gold.
---
In addition to that, if you order/buy the ascended mats and craft all the parts separately i.e. the insignia, the two armor parts (padding/panel), it'll save up more gold since the calculation is taking buying the insignia and padding/panel directly off TP.
---
I think your story would change if you were hit with a false positive, how about you get some understanding.
---
Which one is faster, Roller Beetle, or Griffon?
---
I've felt like anet has slowly morphed into a really bad company over time.  This is proof of that.
---
In WvW there are many different ways to contribute that have nothing to do with meta. I hop on a couple times a day and take care of the borderlands.  I do stuff like;
---
Take any available camps/yaks/shrines/land across entire BL map.
---
I’ll drop guild siege as needed and try to maintain 25 supply from keep.
---
I’ll also drop, build, and use catas solo on tower near spawn and cap it (sometimes solo).  I’ll pop my tag and do this further from spawn as needed.
---
Tick siege in keeps as I’m crossing the map.
---
Tap enemy keeps to block the WP and check swords on our keeps/towers.
---
Respond to most calls for assistance and EWPs.
---
Defend towers against siege (this is great on a staff tempest).
---
Die very little, I use bloodlust Sigil, it typically has 25 stacks except when changing maps.
---
Anyway, most of that has nothing to do with my build it being meta, but benefits my server and I enjoy it.
---
Yes.
---
no its not, this is the bare minimum. Its not "nice" to fix an issue you caused.
---
This should never of happened in the first place and is a clear sign that they don't investigate these things and just ban ppl willy nilly.
---
If they were an Australian company this would be grounds for a slam-dunk case
---
Thanks, just pugging, no regular team, and yeah I'm only interested in T4. I play power minion reaper in open world, just didn't think of using it in fractals since the only group utility it has is Blind, Chill and CC. Will give it a try.
---
They're not even worth selling on the TP. Just saving them for the Festival of the four winds. I suppose. 
---
Probably too much work to revisit old models. A lot of the 1 channel items are old, and very often they will have a new way of creating models/textures that may not mesh well with pulling up older objects. 
---
That being said, its a real shame mistward boots and gloves only have 1 channel. Such great pieces of armor but ruined by single dye channels.
---
The problem people are noting with color disparity is often due to the material of the armor. Different materials (metal, cloth, leather)  look different. The Raven helmet just in the gem store is a great example. Feathers are cloth, but the face plate is metal. The colors on the face plate don't match anything cloth, despite by best attempts. However, this won't change and is a fundamental part of the game.  
---
Wary
---
Thanks! I normally run Curses/Reaper/Scourge, but that wasn't working so I tried Curses/Blood/Scourge. That failed too. Will try Blood/Reaper/Scourge next time.
---
That would be awesome! Guilds always worried me because I cannot stand the grinding people do in other unmentioned inferior games. Lol 
---
Some groups are beyond help.  Each tier has standards that need to be met for smooth clears, and sometimes you get stubborn, sub-par players that run bad builds, refuse to communicate or don't know how to adapt to content.  The best way to clear content is to find other players that respect the content and can play a significant role in carrying themselves.  That's the sort of game this is.  
---
There's an extend that you can carry people with support builds, but even then people have to rise to the occasion and not make silly mistakes that cost them their mistlock singularities.  I find that people tend to do a pretty terrible job of respecting instabilities or trying to brute force content when their DPS isn't up to par for that sort of a strategy.  
---
Don't worry, we have unity/Unreal and MMO starter kits 😂
---
they best give us razah or togo 
---
All good things, glad you're still finding ways to enjoy it and contribute!
---
&gt;Is Eye of the North not part of GW1?
---
Yeah, and it's not mentioned in EotN.  They were first named in an online article that was published *after* EotN was released.
---
There is 0 importance given to the swords *in game*.  
---
&gt;Are we going to ignore the whole Season 2 plot point of Rytlock coming up on Sohothin? 
---
Go read his dialogue on the wiki.  It amounts to "How'd you get it again?"  "Who cares it's not imporant, but adlebern got it from the gods."  
---
&gt;Most other plot points in this game follow that understanding, why is it different here? How is it unfair that someone who chose to not catch up on the series is lost in an ongoing tale?
---
It even being related to the gods at all is one throwaway line of dialogue 3 years back that's easy to miss.
---
Making the most important function of why you suddenly have the ability to kill a fallen god hinge entirely on A) Non existent prequel lore, B) A single line made in passing, and absolutely no attention paid to it's origins *in the expansion in which it is important* is bad writing. 
---
Let us fucking kill Kralk already. I hd enough of purple/pink colors, same for weapons btw. Every second weapon is some kind of mesmery color. 
---
Give us a really neat green set instead. A Grenth Set maybe.    
---
They've only updated the launcher and login screens for expansions, but as players we have no way of telling what they will do or have planned.
---
If you're trying to carry as scourge, don't drop Curses. You'll need parasitic contagion to stay alive. Power reaper can get away with going spite/ blood/ reaper because they have much stronger life force generation, so they can soak a lot more damage with shroud and heal up with lifesteal through it. 
---
Their top speed is the same but griffon is able to maintain it indefinitely,
---
Best comp for this is two support as in a druid and scourge, a chrono and two condi dps scourges. The barrier, condi removal, boon corruption and constant epis made it much easier than other groups ive been in.
---
I think your misunderstanding me, I don't mean in game professions.  I mean use your credit card and buy gems.  The rate at which you earn wealth in game, is far below minimum wage in most areas of the world.  Personally, I make a lot of my money from weekly raids and fractals, which I enjoy, but if I need more than that and I'm going to do something I don't enjoy to get an in game item, like grind silverwastes for 20 hours, I might as well do something like tutor math/physics and earn $25/hour rather than the $2/hour you earn with in game farming.  
---
can someone eli5 this hash stuff for someone who isn't familiar?
---
Agreed to this. Been playing as a DPS Scourge in t4 fractals like OP, the class and build itself has superior tools to excel especially in Siren's Reef bossfight with epi, condi cleanse, boon corrupt, barrier etc and when played well, no doubt a gamechanger.  Reverting to support wont help if sacrificing dps for more heals only prolonged the wipes. If OP played decently while other 4 players were terrible, I doubt bringing support  would change anything unless you are almost there killing the boss.
---
The 4-dps 1-heal party still the main comp for a smooth pug run tho.   
---
I'm ashamed to say I didn't fully read all the instructions.
---
But I usually use Instant replay with a 15 min window and it does work (at least on my side), I tried to put an unedited record on youtube but somehow it didn't like a 5gigs video @ 3440x1440 and that ends up in a horrible [360p](https://youtu.be/dzuRdcMtopc) video.
---
I just hit 80 myself today on my first char and this comment is immensely helpful to me, thank you very much!
---
I don't know. He put a lot of energy and emotion into it...whether it was enough for fairness is one thing, whether I'd want to keep playing is another.
---
Oh man, imagine being so delusional to think that anyone disagreeing with your poorly justified racist bullshit is a "white knight." What's worse is the irony of this situation is entirely lost on you. You're here on reddit blowing your head off over a bad pug experience (which likely has a lot to do with your own ineptitude and inexperience), but the "latins" are the short tempered and shit players. I don't know what you think I have to feel guilty for, but it sure as shit sounds a lot more like angry projection on your part, seek help.
---
A hash is a checksum of some sort. MD5 stands for message digest 5 and should in theory be an algorithm where no 2 inputs produce the same output (well it does, so MD5 is no longer deemed cryptographically safe).
---
That empty hash I'm talking about comes from the cheat detection log that ArenaNet sent me. I recognized it, because I too have hashed empty files by accident in the past.
---
BTW, I don't think ArenaNet hashed an empty file, it's more likely that in their cheat detection they tried to open a process running on my computer that has a higher access required than what gw2.exe was running as. That would result in not getting a result (something we call "null" in programming terminology) and tried to hash this, due to them missing a check for that.
---
r/loligotbanned4this 
---
I think he wasn't being serious. Atleast I hope so.
---
The compensation is a joke.
---
Thank you, u/slashy1302 for getting to the bottom of this and not giving up.
---
I have 2 legendary set but still use  [&amp;Avr2LQEA] more easy for low IQ commander 
---
&gt; On top of that, considering that GDPR allows users to receive all of that private information about themselves, I'd be pretty surprised if a company 
---
&gt; didn't
---
&gt;  ask for certain pieces of information to identify me before sending it to me.
---
You're right, but I sent them my ID attached to my request, which should be sufficient. But since my Account was tied to my GW1 account I had to give them: 
---
3 postal addresses, 3 e-mail addresses (including my wife's, because at one time she paid for one of the addons with her PayPal) and other stuff I could barely remember after more than 13 years. They also wouldn't send me anything until I gave them ALL of the data, when half of it would already prove my identity. They told me they couldn't give me anything before I answered all questions because I might have bought the game from a third party... yet they had access too (and checked) the name on my account and knew it was never registered to anyone else than me.
---
What they sent me back was less than that. Which is a violation as they are required to send me all the personal data that they process and save.. and they do save support tickets and mails.
---
We will go there? How come?
---
yikes this isn’t entirely encouraging, for as much as people keep harping on about how such Discords are godsends whenever a topic like this shows up - I’m especially worried since this pretty much limits options for new raiders, while continuing to favor somewhat-experienced already raiders
---
Huh I see.
---
&gt; that they were taking steps to make sure this false flag doesn't happen again.
---
This is PR Speak 101.
---
Just set up an AHK script like:
---
```D::SellLuckToDrooburt()
---
SellLuckToDrooburt(){
---
Loop 4000 {
---
    Send {F}
---
    sleep, 500
---
    Send {LButton}
---
} }```
---
And then turn on a TV show/console game/phone game and wait.
---
It's costly either way, but grandmaster marks will stop you having up hunt down rare ingredients. 
---
&gt; Fuck them. I'd move on
---
Let me tell you this: FFXIV is a really good MMO, now that I finally got around to playing it together with my wife and at least one other person who tuned back or quit on GW2 over this ;) 
---
Think some of the comments are missing the point. I agree with the OP. I've been saving luck for a long time in hopes that they provide a sink for it. Each stack of the reward you get for it gives you over two gold. 
---
I have NPC filled with stacks of this stuff. I've been spending about 15-20 minute a day 250 clicks per stack of exotic, the highest I can make. All my stuff has been converted to exotic. 
---
If I were just trying for the achievement, it wouldn't be a big deal. But this is a sink for people who have had 300 luck for a long time. Some people delete luck but you know...it's worth well over 100 gold to me.
---
I'm hitting f and clicking once 250 times per stack. There has to be a better way to have set this up.
---
Every overlay need to be tested out, so general install instructions is to disable overlays, and then tinker on your own.
---
the gw2.dat holds most of the game's data hence its massive size (mine is 42gb), so if gw2 is corrupted, that gw2.dat is most likely corrupted and that means a full clean install is needed. Trust me i know it sucks to download 40gb again but its the first thing GW2 support will ask you to do and this most likely will fix it, if not we have a big problem.
---
Just a heads up Gw2 uses DirectX 9
---
Also a funny random fix sometimes is just to wait.... because sometimes when installing and reinstalling stuff (drivers mainly), stuff can get corrupted in the depths of the OS and then refuse to install again. Then come the next windows update, the corrupted drivers/ registry keys are re-downloaded / cleaned properly and suddenly everything works. However since it is isolated to gw2 i doubt this would work.
---
Dm OP, seems like he has that proof.
---
For me the biggest pro is the speed boost from industry. Not for the speed boost itself but look at this:
---
Often an enemy is near a node. With glyph of industry I am finished gathering before I get tagged by the mob in 3 of 4 cases and can mount right before I get hit, while without I would have to kill said enemy to mount again.
---
That's why for me industry offers the best qol, while maybe not being the most profitable on paper.
---
The devs edited the map art in every location that we have gone to in season 4. Kourna, Istan, sunswept isles, and I think Deldrimor were all edited as well as the region kralk woke up in the blood legion homelands.
---
Even if a company doesn't have a HQ in Europe and have European costumers, they have to abide by GDRP nevertheless.
---
there was a really cool theory on tumblr about the size of zhaitan/why we don't fight him face to face , i'll link it [here](https://whiskeyworen.tumblr.com/post/178989339589/nothing-special-just-been-thinking-about-that)! it's obviously more of an attempt to justify the encounter lore-wise, because i think it's quite evident with the later releases that it's taken anet some time to figure out how to handle close encounters with elder dragons, but i really enjoyed reading it and it has made me feel excited about replaying the personal story again :) 
---
I'm sadly still very disappointed in them. It's soon been an entire year and we have lost so much more game time than just 6 months. I mean, heck, after a thing like this you don't even see the point of creating a new account because that could've just as well had gotten banned too as suddenly as it happened the last time.
---
I feel this was a very sloppy apology from them..The very least they could've done for us is to go out with this themselves and apologize more publicly than just sending out emails respectively. These gems and episodes don't really make up for anything in the end... 
---
You can't, but you can have processes running at a higher security level than the user that ran gw2.exe. They scanned processes in memory and also queried the file contents from  memory rather than file level (from what I remember). They probably did not check if their pointer to the process's memory is correct and instead hashed a null-pointer/empty response or something.
---
Those people probably posted in this sub saying they were banned for no reason and then got trashed and abused and called liars by this sub.
---
did your uncle at nintendo tell you this.
---
Probably will just keep the Path of Fire visual screen and launcher. I'm personally more interested in what they'll do with masteries. They could just release a new mastery track tacked on to the Crystal Desert, but you never know! 
---
i recommend using references for your proportions next time
---
I got the same email, but the account name is wrong. Not that I care. I'm not coming back to this company, ever
---
When you've done map completion 20+ times, the answer is every single heart is the worst.
---
Most of the people I was playing with went to EU, so I'm just not going to get back into it at this point.
---
It doesn't punish you as long as you log in every few months to get your new LS episode unlocked for free
---
Um. I think you have me confused with someone else, bud, I've made no such post.. like, ever. So... yeah. Don't know how to respond to that. I *do* see that you either saw my point and chose to accuse me of... whatever that was, or missed my point entirely. 
---
I'll do you the kindness of assuming you're just having an off day, or that my wording was bad, and rephrase myself.
---
I'm pointing out that your comment, to me, is hypocritical. You are accusing this person of being remarkably unpleasant and that warrants them leaving our community, but your very comment is unpleasant and hostile. By your own logic, you yourself should not be in the community, as you're spreading the very kind of thing you're seeking to shut out.
---
Or, to put it another way, if you want to protect this community, known for its helpfulness and kindness, it is my thinking that it would serve your goal to respond with those things at heart, because kindness breeds kindness, and bile breeds bile. 
---
This community - hell, all communities, these days - needs kindness, not shit like this. But, apparently, that's just my opinion. =/
---
bounty hunter would look really cool. if you do the wvw/pvp desert armor reward track you can get the key pieces pretty fast. i think dark templar or armageddon could also work depending on how you use dyes (the cinders dye is amazing to make armor look rough/worn)  grasping dead could also be a good option, available from the arah dungeon track in wvw/pvp
---
&gt; Shit got banned what do we do now?
---
&gt; Guess let’s fuck. 
---
you still got that message? answer hin with: get assfucked whiteknight fanboi
---
Oh gosh I'm so sorry, I thought you were the OP. The deleted comment in this post is OP calling us all kinds of awful stuff in caps. I thought you were him. I'm sorry man.
---
It's true. Dungeons may not give rewards that make them even close to worth it, but you need the dungeon currency for legionaries and there are achievements. 
---
It will most likely stay the same. PoF will probably be required to access LS5 content.
---
I felt that way pretty much from the start.  I came into the game right at the end of living world season 1.  The first thing I noticed, dungeons were buggy as shit and Anet had no intentions of fixing them.  
---
"Higher user than gw2" as in a process that requires administrator or other higher privileges to run? When it tries to hash this process an empty string is returned and it is hashed?
---
Hey, no worries - happens to the best of us! Hope I gave you something to think about at least - spread the love and all that good stuff :)
---
&gt; They insisted I was a cheater and would not accept any appealing to this ban.
---
That to me would be **plenty** reason to switch my MMORPG of choice tbh. They don't want my money here, well, fair enough. Not like FF14 isn't around, nevermind non-MMORPG offerings.
---
urgh nexon... played atlantica online at release.. great game but typical f2p problems. and once it went to nexon it went mich worse very fast
---
Your real prize is knowing that you helped other people who were wrongfully banned get their accounts back. 
---
did you report it via the ingame bug report?
---
I can't fully remember the details, hopefully the guy you asked responds to you.  But I believe fractal levels have been reset for everyone, two times.  1 time pre-hot when they expanded fractal levels from 30 to 50, and once with the release of hot.  Or maybe hot just felt like a reset because t2 fractals were clearly not equal to the old fractal 50 level of difficulty.  
---
But for sure, I can remember they reset our fractal levels down at least once for the entire community.  
---
Somewhat reminds me of the Dark Magician from Yu-Gi-Oh, very cool
---
I think bare minimum, you offer anyone falsely banned the option to accept a full refund on every purchase they ever made from Anet, obviously this would include deleting the gw2 account.  
---
But they didn't play GW2 for 9 months.
---
Given the experience they had dealing with the company, isn't that plenty reward in itself already? With any luck they've been happily playing another game in the meantime.
---
Do the weaver collection for the sword from, POF
---
Maybe if he had room temperature IQ.
---
This post is to casul for me.
---
Thats pretty sad.  My god, they're a large studio, and one guy found their huge mistake in a matter of minutes.  
---
FF14 high-five! &lt;3
---
God, I love how interwoven the personal story is.
---
That's what I thought but my griffon very quickly replaced my other mounts. You can get around 80%-90% of the map with him alone, so one could say….. the other's aren't needed \*wink wink\*
---
No, that isn't plenty reward in itself.  Anet gave them a reward that presupposes these customers will ever play this game again.  Bare minimum they should be offered a choice to accept a full refund (obviously this would delete their account).  
---
You can also do holosmith collection
---
You know what I find curious, it's that new players never get groups going on their own, read/watch a guide, some clear videos and try to do the boss and figure out what works out for them on their own.
---
It's cool having an initiative like trainers and stuff and people taking their time to teach fights on the fly and maybe give pointers during the training runs. But no one wanting to get in there and figure stuff out with people at their level when guides and clear POVs for all classes and roles are out there says a lot more about the community than anything.
---
&gt; Here they have drastically fallen short of that standard. 
---
I've played GW2 since beta.
---
I'm sorry, but over the years I've learned that whatever standard people hold ANet to... no. They're definitely not a triple-A dev. Not nearly. Many of their issues scream ineptitude at me, or rather lack of knowledge. I suspect a lot of that is unfixable due to the old engine and the people now working with it not being the ones who made/knew it originally.
---
But the game is full of technicaly flaws and cut corners.
---
Does this specific thing still baffle me how a professional company can fuck up **this badly**? Yes, of course. MD5-hashing in 2018 alone makes me /facepalm. But honestly in some regards it fits right in with how ANet has been behaving over the years as a company.
---
That's the thing, we had a similar situation at work a while ago - albeit for business software. We took **two hours** to investigate **and** resolve it.
---
Two hours!
---
And we still had people be within an inch of getting fired over it, just because of how much we publicly showed utter ineptitude.
---
And ANet drags their feet for 9 months over this, only to then basically admit that they are stupid (md5 hash? In 2018? And that's all they went by, instead of using it as a first indicator? Wow...) **and** arrogant (all they give you is 1 season + 2500 gems, oh wow)? Geez. I'd be long fired at work :(
---
Thanks for the info. I'm guessing in the end, my choice will stand or fall by my personal preference, as both seem equally good
---
Ah I see, thought only the blue one could be looted. Thanks!
---
They should make Shield 4 an AoE burst heal and make shield 5 shield destroy projectiles.
---
I think Protection buff should be shifted to Shield trait, and Shield 4 cleanses 2 conditions.
---
Seems like a very rare bug. You guys got some time wasted, but at least you had fun. :)
---
Thank you, that makes sense. But then, wouldn't there be literally hundreds of those false positives? Isn't OS running on admin level, while other programs need to specifically be executed as admins? I would imagine that such an issue would be widespread, and especially on Linux maybe? But that is just uneducated guess of mine.
---
Burn them.
---
And does any of that put a dent in the fact that they were banned from playing a game they paid for for 9 months? I'd expect full reimbursement of w/e it was i paid for. A Full refund, If i bought both expansions+ the original game go ahead and give me that back too. $100 worth of a game i paid for and didnt get to play for 9 months. Thats how you fix the problem, not honeydicking your customer base with shitty cash shop currency. fuck outta here, not everyone here is an anet shill like you clearly are lmao. white knight gtfo, He would have gotten some living world story line quests just for being active during those 9 months that's the least they could do.
---
How would destroy projectiles be better than a block
---
care to elaborate what is this all about? new player here
---
Not at my PC so I can't check right now, but IIRC using a skirmish chest opens up a vendor window. You should be able to select the item you want and input the amount of the reward you want.
---
I totally agree! Sadly you sign an agreement when you create an account vs going into a store
---
I love gw2 so much and i already invest way too many time and money to quit. But i agree with you. If that was me, i would have rage so hard, not even worth to come back with the freebies. Maybe i will if its only a week or two but not months.
---
The new content doesnt last as long as LS3 but im still grateful because its free. And the customer support... only like 1 out of 20 are actually decent, the rest doesnt even read the ticket and gave copy paste reply.
---
$31.25 is a lot? lmfao 
---
Glad to be of service!
---
Probably means Soul Reaping when he says Reaper...I hope
---
As in the process was running at System level rights or anything. Mind you, that's only a guess, but it's the most fitting explanation. I do not know their algorithm by heart and I can't test run it as it would update my gw2.exe and remove that code.
---
There's really no financial incentive for them to go back and do that sadly. 
---
What they might do though, is re-release older armors with minor texture changes they did with the lunatic Halloween set. 
---
Yeah for this specific fight if you want the hypothetical maximum carry potential I'd say balls to the wall support firebrand is a ridiculously hard carry. Reflects, stab, aegis etc. are super strong on the last encounter.
---
If the product is on the european market they have to abide by GDPR. That's why it was such a big thing.
---
Anet has to abide by GDPR. 
---
Not much, gw2 have one of the best story in MMOs but all 3 final battles are pretty boring. He'll last episode fight was much better than any of this, tho I still think to give epicness of deities such as elder dragons or gods the fights should be like dragon stand map
---
leave when you can.
---
Maybe because it has fuck all to do with the topic at hand?
---
yeh it's literally nothing, I just check and my account value increased by 23k between april 1st and october 1st. This is not even a 10th of that.
---
Keep in mind I never farmed istan/sw, so yeh this is literally a no effort fix from then. Shouldn't be praised by anyone, so hate these extreme fanboy people think they're super generous for this.
---
Nah, most of the stories explored in earlier raids were more or less picked up on further on in the Living World seasons (the whole White Mantle and Lazarus saga which started in Forsaken Thicket, Eye of Janthir in Bastion of the Penitent). I'm pretty sure that Arenanet might explore Isgarren's story further in the raid content or a fractal at least (also, seeing how the last raid was finished, Qadim's story also seems far from over)
---
Another thing I noticed after prowling the cheater forms to find out about UNF was that it only ran on the 32 bit client and I have used the 64 but client since heart of thorns was released.  But I went to support with that information. Was completely ignored. 
---
Daily fractals, daily HoT metas, daily Istan, Silverwastes farm, gathering, you have things to do.
---
I think the biggest problem of hot is that it's story about saving your friends and not about fighting a dragon. I remember the moment we finally caught zojja and Logan I was like, one more and we can finally start dealing with mordy, and then wtf next mission we're killing him. I literally thought we're like halfway through story at this point. There was no buildup to final mission that's why hot is so weak for me
---
Since shield is a supportive weapon, you would likely only use it on a healing herald build which means you will take glint/ventari. Ventari already has a very very good skill to destroy projectiles so I wouldn't wanna see another skill on shield doing the same thing.
---
It has been known/speculated for a while that the bulk of the work on the game had been done pre launch and there is relatively high turnover in the company right now due to uncompetitive conditions or poor managment at some level. 
---
Companies say that all the time. Heck even I (working in software development) wrote emails stating some error can only happen in a very unlikely scenario while knowing it happend all the time. It's usual business practice to downplay mistakes to a certain amount to not put too much blame on yourself.
---
Nobody knows the full numbers, but since I know the background of the error they made I can at least tell that this can happen more often that it should.
---
Whenever there was a post on implementing standard mmorpg and other qol features into the game I always joked and said "the technology just isn't there", seems I wasn't too far off...
---
every new person ever :P
---
They went out to those who were banned for the full time till October 2018 (or probably maybe were permanently banned due to prior incidents).
---
Can never have enough transmutation charges, you can always pick that!
---
Then they shouldn't complain about the need to "grind", should something shiny ever come out.
---
Well, I would assume that support guys just got "don't discuss with them" order, as they don't really know anything about it. And getting directly to people in background who do....well...is hard. :(
---
Those gems amount to less than what you'd get if you do your dailies every day, gather guild halls and sell what you receive for those 6 months of lockout. So, there's that.
---
Thats odd.. I also don't remember it, is it on the side the Destroyers are? (if i remember correctly they are destroyers)
---
The sub has a lot of dumb theories, doesn't make them any more true.
---
Regardless of track record "no appeals" is unacceptable. There's a reason appeals are a thing. Being judge, jury and executioner isn't good. Being incompetent on top of that only makes it worse. 
---
If not for GDPR, I assume support would have told OP to fuck off, and nothing else would ever come of it. Considering how support was already unwilling to deal with him, this seems a rather reasonable assumption.
---
so being falsely banned, getting 2500gems (803g if u bought with ingame gold) and the stories they would've gotten for free, so don't say they gifted it to them cause they didn't...
---
So you're saying that is enough for a 6month ban? Where me and multiple friends/guildies looked and noticed their account value increased by 20k+!
---
Note even if you only did dailies you'd get more value from that than what they refunded. You'd get 360g liquid from 6months daily and then add daily log in rewards is 130g of mystic coins, 170ish g from laurels, 48clovers/120extra laurels/6-12ascended crafting materials depending which u pick.
---
So how do you even think this is "A lot"? Seriously you must be a delusional white knight fanboy.. Now imagine the raiders, they missed 6months of rewards (60g liquid/week and 15li+4LD till w6).
---
They should've atleast given 10 times the rewards and then it'd be close to acceptable..
---
The best way to get into raiding in gw2 is to find a guild that is willing to do training runs or join one of the public discords for raid trainings (Like Crossroads Inn, even SnowCrows has them listed on their site)
---
I can confirm this staircase is new.
---
That someone is unable or unwilling to earn gold consistantly doesn't make any difference in the definition of grinding and difficulty to complete fixed length tasks.
---
His choices, with their consequences. VacuumViolator might not use the most peaceful ways to express it, but he's right.
---
That would be like claiming that 20$ is a lot ... if you work three days a month. 20$ is objectively not a lot. It might be relatively for you if your activities and lifestyle don't bring you the ways to earn consistantly, but we don't create objective values towards a single subjective person, we do it on statistics average. And on average, as reminded, the game offers plenty of ways to get the 250 gold, especially on a 6 years timeframe. Or, would you start from 0 right now and aim for the griffon, it would take you a few months of casual play. Way less than a legendary.
---
**hype!**
---
Go to r/guildrecruitment and find a training guild. The big ones advertised on Snow Crows are good and all, but they are big, like really big. Thousands of ppl in Discord and afaik they raffle the spots on training runs so it's not guaranteed to get into runs as often as you'd like - so a smaller training guild might work better, plus you get to make some in-game friends.
---
IIRC people concluded that when ANet designed the beetle adventure there, they lowered some terrain, so that part just kinda uncovered itself.
---
According to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acc9st/very_small_map_changes/ it seems the wall was moved up. 
---
But why this has happened, only anet knows, maybe it was just a side effect when they added the race.
---
The terrain in the before pics was already lower though, the staircase has it *raised.*
---
It's not 31+ dollars, it's a measly amount of make-believe currency of which they have an unlimited supply. As compensation it's LESS than nothing as it won't affect their ledgers in the slightest.
---
Not even a slap on the wrist - more like a public domain photo of someone else's wrist.:P
---
Ahaha don't worry we've all been there mate
---
Yeah I agree but it just really shitty to ignore a customer only to apologize 9 months later with some pretty crappy email (my email has someone else's account name in it and I assume someone has my account name in their email)
---
What kind of third-party programs give unfair advantage? Are people actually able to cheat in fights? 
---
Have to disagree with you here. Having heads roll over a colossal cockup like this is a healthy thing for a company, particularly if the heads include those of an appropriately high tier of management. If the organization lives in existential fear of making a fuckup of this scale, they are more likely to double check and doubt complaints less. 
---
The gate is a different color as well.
---
Then, who should I believe, between a company that can lie, and a player that can judge on mere intent ?
---
Should I just take their numbers, then yours, and calculate a basic average, just like we do on the number of demonstrators according to police/protest figures ?
---
This made WvW run so much smoother for me. i5 8400 and rx580, 8gm system ram. Runs 60fps all the time and drops to around 45-50 in huge zergs. Was getting drops to around 25-30 prior to using this. Thanks heaps for making this for us! I also don't get any screen tearing anymore and moving the camera around has no micro stutter anymore.
---
It's actually hilarious comparing the dots on the mini map of myself and my friend when travelling from point A to B. Especially now we have the new mastery, technically all you 'need' is the springer and the griffin
---
I don't know how old are you or for how long you draw but ... well ... at lest it is more practice for you, right?
---
Right then I won't sugar coat it like the rest. The head is just the tip of the iceberg what's wrong.   
---
Your proportions are all wrong, ESPECIALLY considering your drawing a charr. Ignoring the fact that the whole body has the wrong proportions why did you draw a charr with a human body?   
---
Next time your gonna use reference while drawing be sure to actually use it, this work proves you didn't actually use the reference, otherwise the proportions wouldn't be so jacked (and again, charrs don't have human bodies) and there's not a single appealing thing about the color/light/render because you flat out don't know what it even is or how it works.

Here's my constructive crit: Start learning your fundamentals and use your head when you draw. It's very obvious you are impatient with very low knowledge and that's a deadly combo. Here's a good one for beginners and I HIGHLY suggest you do the whole thing word for word [https://drawabox.com/](https://drawabox.com/), after that specialized books on different subject matters: Robertson (How to draw &amp; How to render), Anatomy for sculptors: Understanding the human form, James Gourney: Light and Colour, Figure Drawing (Hampton or Loomis, most of the popular figure drawing books are good), Perspective made easy by Earnest Norling.   
---
None of these are optional, you will need knowledge on all the fundamentals.   
---
All in all everything is shit and if you ACTUALLY want to improve and want constructive crit like you said then here you go. I just gave you over a years worth of work to improve your drawing. These subjects are the fundamentals of art and without them you will never be able to draw anything proper. Up to you if your actually gonna do it or not, I don't like spoon feeding beginners so that's all your getting, if your serious you will easily find every resource you will ever need and do your own research. Good luck with the craft.  
---
Regret removing the art filter...

There used to be/maybe still is a group called Raiders Inn. They were pretty good at running training raids. Learned w1-4 with them. Very rarely did I get many clears with them, but you get to at least go in, try/see the mechanics (ie. the most important parts of raids) over and over again without getting kicked. Eventually you can take those experiences and join a non-training PUG run. Those will be hit or miss (even if they list as 5million LI), but generally have better experienced groups than explicit training runs.
---
A (possible better) alternative is to join a guild that raids and has members that like to raid for the sake of raiding. Many people just go in on reset and then not again for a week. Good number will repeat the content just cuz. Get in a guild that has the latter and can teach you the raids, carry you a bit until you figure things out, and get you to a point where you actually contribute.
---
Your goal is to go tanky open world weaver with a focus on condition damage? 
---
Any reason for this specific setup? There are other good open world builds and in general having decent damage means you kill things faster and have to "tank" (mainly avoid) damage for a shorter time.
---
Is there a reason for Arcane? Fire is going to be better for a condition build.
---
You could go for a budget [condition weaver](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/condition/) build that runs rabid gear (cheap and tanky like you want) something like [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJAodncMAF5iFNAmNAM5iFBA7Ws+WHEAClHghYwOoIA-jxRFABJcCAcS5HAPAA40DA0+DZpEsR1fAA-e). Skills can be swapped to whatever you like, weapon suggestion is sword or dagger + focus, without expertise from viper gear your condition duration is going to be very low so if you plan to actually run this and not upgrade it it might be better to get [sigil of agony](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Agony) and [sigil of smoldering](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Smoldering) with [runes of the nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Nightmare) (20%) or even [tempest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Tempest) (25%)

He's always been an incompetent braggart. He loved to pat himself on the back in a public forum whenever he banned someone. Very unprofessional.
---
Maybe.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
To be fair in most of those cases CS ppl were pinged and individually checked and were found to be false claims.

There is a centaur cave behind the monastery that lets you get progress.

NCSoft, the publishers, are Koreans. ANet are Americans. And it's not like Korean companies are worse at giving a crap about folks than US companies.
---
Hot damn, that does make that final battle sem alot more impactful.
---
I approve of this theory! 
---
Good job on your perseverance.
---
It's time to fire up some [old goodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF3437WVnEs) now.  
---
\^tbm
---
Then if you can't do this, maybe you shouldn't be banning people to begin with. Wrongful convictions are a terrible thing, more so if unlike the actual legal system you disallow these people any chance of a defense by simply shutting the door and ignoring their yelling.
---
It's sad that not only they can get away with it, but that they will. Already did. :(  
---
I don't mind banning cheaters. I don't mind that you will have the odd false positive. But **jesus fucking christ ANet**, do you have to ignore them for months instead of just maybe, maaaaybe, realizing that your detection process is utter bullshit?
---
Or he could be like me. I have quite a bit of LI but I don't see much of a point, if any point at all, in wasting my money and resources on legendary armour. 
---
All of my characters have at least 2 if not 3 full ascended sets depending on spec, and I swap characters around constantly to keep the game 'fresh'. Building a legendary set would prettymuch be just another ascended set that I already have, and even the skin is not that good (on Charr at least). 
---
Soooo, apart from shitty (subjective ofc) skin and stats that you can change out if you wanna personally try new things.. what's the point of legendary armour?
---
&gt; but people say chrono isnt good what should I do D:
---
Huh? Chrono is really good, i don't know where you got that information from.
---
Trading post or credit card
---
Yeah exactly. The least they could've done is give these players all future expansions/releases for free. A six month ban is a long fucking time, and I imagine many of them simply quit due to it. To give them $30 worth of their fucking monopoly money is a joke if you ask me.
---
Is... is this a fetish? :|
---
&gt; Now you may be wondering why I still play in spite of all of this. Ultimately, it's because this discipline issue is just that: a black mark on what is otherwise a really good company.
---
For me it's much simpler: No monthly fee. I don't truly **quit** the game. However, my combined playtime for the last 6 months is... around 5 hours, according to my system. But that's less because of their attitude and more because of how boring modern LS releases are.
---
Oh oh! I had something like that happen. Was banned for 3 days because the Paypal API had a problem and of course that's somehow my fault and I deserved to be punished. For a purchase **that never got through**. At all. I didn't get anything, no money was taken, nothing.
---
In that case they'll have to use a macro for now. Anet probably doesn't have a solution for "contribute all the luck you have at once" and not have it mess up with the achievement count.
---
Someone mentioned in another thread that if you have donated 99/100 food for the festival achievement, and you choose an option to donate 100 food it will count as 1 and move to next tier essentially wasting 99 food. I assume it's similar with the luck achievement. Bad implementation on their part, and I'm sure they're aware of it.
---
It takes a lot longer to ctrl+c, alt-tab, enter, ctrl+v, enter, alt-tab, ctrl+c ...(repeat) than it does to just hold ctrl and click on your stacks really fast. A good commander will call you out on your long-linking bullshit and kick you.
---
Everything I've said is from the source I included. I've no idea what you're talking about.
---
First of all, your "white knight" comment is totally past the point. I'm not defending them but it seems that whatever you say against or try to understand their point of view you directly are against them and for the company. You are wrong. I criticized where and when I can if it is necessary which you would know if you actually knew me.
---
And since plenty of players do not share this opinion doesn't mean that you can interpret anything out of it.
---
Yes GW2 has many issues which you clearly pointed out but do they really invalidate the points I made?
---
What do you think would happen if ArenaNet really didn't "give a shit" about us? Buy to play and pay to win in the gem store, the banned accounts would still stay banned and the overall flair of the game would go in the opposite direction like every player having to pay for the living world episode instead of getting it basically for free.
---
They also edited LA, gendarran fields and some other map art with lunar new year, you can't rely on map art to predict future maps anymore (That_Shaman said the same as well.)
---
You still can't pinpoint this to a single person. In my opinion and after talking with at least 7 people during this it's more of a chain of small mistakes that made this mess big. So who would you fire? 
---
- the person implementing the algorithm in the cheat detection?
---
- Chris Cleary (who since then moved positions or company anyway) as Security Team Lead? 
---
- The lower customer support who just acts as ordered? 
---
- Customer support lead who did not recheck accounts?
---
- All of them?
---
The only thing they would do is find a scapegoat and fire him/her. Not much would change imo, only that one person, probably not even due to his/her fault, has to look for a new job.
---
 I'm working in software development myself and I can only do my work because I know that my company backs me up and not just kill me of the minute I did something wrong.
---
But maybe that's just my opinion, you are of course allowed to think otherwise.
---
thank you, but I don't mean just condition builds. It's less known than people usually know, and Metabattle doesn't well post "budget" build.
---
That's busted. 
---
budget means using cheap condition gears like Carrion, Dire and so on. It's just for newbies who want to try condition build some budget way, but effective enough. so, elite specs are not matter actually.
---
It doesn't matter much. For those who agree I'm preaching to the choir. But the game also won't ever go big for them. The hivemind community will do everything in their power to shoot anything that doesn't fit their playstyle down, after all. The ones that don't agree? Well they'll feel righteously empowered to hit the downvote button and write a 2 line response on how evil everyone who isn't a snowflake is. The hivemind is on their side so how could they possibly be wrong?! 
---
Luckily I'm certain without nerfing raids down to open world difficulty what they demand will never happen. And if they nerf raids to open world difficulty or implement easy LFR mode, it'll lead to a short-term increase followed by the entire raiding scene falling appart and most players who "agree" with my point of view being even more frustrated. I assume those losses will be more players than the amount of new players deciding to jump ship to GW2 because it has "nicer" raids now. Which only means a further, smaller community to continue to support the game; aka less content. This trend has been the main trend for the game for years, where the nicest community labels everyone who plays differently from them as evil, excludes them as much as possible, yet acts suprised when they aren't welcome and catering to them without limits. 
---
If anet doesnt' do anything, then they'll continue to demand more and more of the people putting effort into keeping the scene alive. Raid trainers, guilds, commanders that organise squads and clean runs, people making content and trying to overcome these issues. However they can't keep up if the vast majority of the population simply doesn't have any interest in doing more than the bare minimum. Those very people are the first to end up burned out and often annoyed. They're less willing to continuously put in the effort, and are being told not to. This has again been true for all content outside of open world, not just raids, but fractals, pvp, wvw, ... The result is more toxicity and a more fragmented community. Less fun, less groups, lower accessibility. (Aka literally pvp, raids, wvw, ...). 
---
I'm here to watch the decadence of a game I enjoyed. I'm here to watch a community which convinced itself the game is for them -and only for them- destroy itself while calling everyone else elitist. Because it's truthfully the best content the game has created in these last years. Also work is boring yo
---
Didn't know that, just learned something new, so sorry.
---
I don't know what you wanna play but for open world anything would work. Every class has kind of a "condi" trait. I could imagine that necro is still able to do good condition dmg (try curses + soul reaping).
---
I would also give mesmer a try (illusions, chaos, duelling)
---
I think that was a bit different. You can't make karma gathering tools into something else, the only way to use them is to well ... use them for gathering. And that is a lot more time consuming than buying a whole inventory of karma gear and wrangling it through the mystic forge in order to get free crafting materials. And back then karma amounts weren't as rampant as they are nowadays, so karma had a lot more inherit "conversion value" in the early stages of the game than it has now, since you didn't have as much of it.
---
include "git gud" picture (a message to the community one)
---
Condi DD with Rampagers.
---
It's basically a hybrid tho, but it does respectable damage, can be played on Core Thief, and easy to play.
---
Just don't spam Dagger 3 non stop, even if it is a good source of Damage, the evades are very important to survivability. 
---
It's like Bethesda caught wind about the Anet "good will gesture" before they "compensated" players with 500 Atoms in Fallout76 for not getting the advertised canvas bag.
---
Yeah, some skills that destroyed projectiles used to destroy unblockable projectiles as well (like Mesmer Focus 5 I think), while others (ie Guardian Shield 5) didn't. I wasn't entirely sure either so I checked wiki.
---
Do it while you sleep?
---
Where do you draw the line between trusting the data your company has brought forwards VS being skeptical about it every time someone claims it to be a mistake?
---
I feel for you, OP, but ArenaNet should only be named faulty to a certain extent. If you have a massive game like GW2, and you have to sift through literally hundreds of thousands of accounts to look for cheaters, it is very normal that a program is used to identify those with the cheating signatures.
---
Now, they received the results of their program, picked a few random results, and manually looked if they were indeed cheating. It's called statistical sample taken at random. When they noticed that they had (what I presume) to be a 100% accuracy rate for the sample they took, they went ahead and banned everyone with the cheating signature.
---
Now, they made an error and did not notice it. I get it, you're pissed that all these months you weren't taken seriously in your claim that you were innocent. Trust me, I understand how frustrating it is since I had the same thing happen to me when playing another MMO. 
---
But the healthiest thing to do when something like that happens is to either accept you're banned, proof you're right, and when either of those 2 choices have been made, understand that the mistake was NOT malign.
---
They did NOT intentionally try to make you feel bad. They were just relying on their information regarding hundreds of thousands of accounts being analysed and weren't aware that a small group of people were impacted. 
---
So I ask again, where should Arenanet draw the line between believing their data and being skeptical about it every time someone claims it to be a mistake?
---
Macros.
---
I've yet to see anyone demand that you ping multiple times. Generally you do your mass ping and they put you into the squad.
---
Who is dinky?
---
Fractal armour can be cheaper indeed. Check [Tanetris’s guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#But_what_about_ascended_armor.3F) — scroll down a bit and you’ll find tables comparing the cost of crafting armour with berserker, viper, harrier and magi prefixes vs buying them from fractal/PvP vendors using current Trading Post prices. You’ll see that sometimes fractal armour is more expensive than crafted, but it is generally cheaper.
---
You may want to check the weapon section as well. In fact, that entire document is a good read.
---
Thank You, Thank You, Thank you!
---
I've been asking ArenaNet for this for years since WOW, FF14 etc has already done it but they said Nooooooooo, it will take millions of Gems to make the even Direct X "11" conversion/translation. Yet here we are with you DX12 working so well(aside from a few glitch here and there), that even getting "42 FPS @EBG SMC vs Blobgate" while testing earlier is a Miracle from the Six. I can clearly see the delay on their 1 skill attacks while I've been running smooth in there the whole time. 
---
The FACT that a single person did this indicates that Anet either is lying, lazy, greedy by focusing on paid content over optimization, or worse, incompetent.
---
You Sir/Madam, are the DURANTE that GW2 deserves. /salute
---
As for a few bug/glitch report.
---
\-SLI doesn't seem to work for me either when using GW2 SLI profile, AFR1 or AFR2. Monitoring Shows only 1 of my 1070 SLI working. Still 1 is overkill compared to DX9. Tried adding CoherentUI\_Host.exe to the GW2 SLI profile via Inspector and still getting the same thing. Tried with Fasy Sync on and off. Windowed Fullscreen.  
---
\-Software based keyboard macros like the Logitech Gaming Software doesn't work with this. Unable to use my macro keys. Confirmed to work in GW2 vanilla. Tried adding CoherentUI\_Host.exe to the LGS profile and still no macro keys. AutoHotKey works though.  
---
\-Texture popins/stuck on load but this is a known issue, just wanted to let you know it happens on NVME, RAMCACHE and RAMDISK as well.
---
Specs For Info: i9 9900K@5.2, 64gb DDR4@3.1, GTX1070SLI, Adata SX8200pro 1TB NVME(stock,ramcache,ramdisk tested)

I got this system lately to barely speed up my GW2 experience from Xeon x5675/i7 970 FIRST Gen iSeries. Got 5-10FPS increase in crowds. GW2 so optimised /S
---
You can strafe back and forth, it resets your light and there's a chance you get the chest. I think the spot was middle of the tile closest to the wall, between two tiles. If that makes sense
---
&gt; Now, they received the results of their program, picked a few random results, and manually looked if they were indeed cheating. It's called statistical sample taken at random. When they noticed that they had (what I presume) to be a 100% accuracy rate for the sample they took, they went ahead and banned everyone with the cheating signature.
---
Prove that they even did that.
---
As for using a program they should ensure the program is fullproof in actually picking up cheaters who modify the actual game. They even admitted at the time that their methods didn't even do that. They were given reams of feedback that applications that they were assuming were malign had legitimate uses, something anyone with a passing knowledge of IT security would know. Its also worth noting that Clearly appears to have been moved aside over this.
---
Yeah but if you were the designer that lowered the terrain, you would also want to put some staircase so the door isn't above ground.
---
to cover the imperfection (discovered since linked post) ?
---
You are why raiding never should have been implemented in this game. 
---
There was also a second phase to the Mouth of Mordremoth fight (as well as a fourth DS lane and a bunch of stuff involving the Nightmare Court in all of HoT that had to be cut for time.
---
Running out of time seems to be the standard for elder dragon battles, can't wait to find out what awesome could-have-beens we'll find out about after we kill Kralkatorrik.
---
I just increased my main's inventory size to ludicrious levels and suddenly there's nothing I can't hold anymore
---
I agree with some of your points though don't share the overall sentiment. GW2 wasn't great in the beginning but we didn't notice because it was a new game. The problems began with the endgame content which was basically non-existent. This changed over the years and got a lot better.
---
But this is something that is purely objective and IMO has no relevance to the points I mentioned because you will not please everyone.
---
&gt; You're delusional
---
I'm not, as we can see with many other companies in the gaming industry that always say "we care" and milk the players to no end. So it is a very 
---
&gt; So ... your point is what? That the bans aren't permanent? It's already been shown a dozen times that permanent bans plain do not work.
---
Again, I'm not arguing about the specific issue but rather the argument that ArenaNet doesn't care because "not caring" does look differently to me. My point was more about the connection between a bug created a huge mistake and suddenly ArenaNet is labeled to "not care" there is no relation between those things, at least to me.
---
&gt; You think anet would've gone F2P base game if they didn't think it'd lead to MORE sales overall?
---
I don't really understand how going F2P was ArenaNet not caring because to me it does...
---
For once, going free to play removes the initial barrier for a potential new player. They won't spend money on "the cat in the bag" and check out the game. This will create an influx and stream of players which will have affects on all parts of the game and make the game feel more alive. Those new players will then see that they have fun in the game and are encouraged to buy it which will create revenue that helps the game to get developed further.
---
I think what most are forgetting is that any gaming company is a business and needs to make money to stay alive or else the game gets cut, shut down or they will go out of business.
---
For Crystal Hibernation I would like this:  
---
Reduce cooldown to 20 seconds  
---
Remove healing, replace with Energy replenishment and 3s Resistance on cast  
---
Add projectile reflection  
---
Grant Protection (6s) when cast ends  
---
For Envoy Of Exuberance I would like this:  
---
Parry the next attack and release a healing wave to yourself and allies equal to 50% of the damage. If an attack is not parried you will instead apply Blind (3s) on your next attack.
---
I think its only a little part, that is so toxic. For example, like every Raid beginner Guild is friedly as hell, even after 100k wipes. Every static i helped out was very friendly and when they failed they laughed about it and joked about it. So its a mess to generalize, that the whole raidcoommunity is toxic. At least, thats my opinion.
---
I did it in around a week. Didn't rush it, tried to mostly finish one collection a day and work a bit on PoF map completion while doing it. Just doing it here and there between sessions of PvP &amp; WvW.
---
It's actually a bit surprising how quickly you can rack up this kind of gold, I didn't even do any PvE for it. Just sold some mats I sat on, rest from ranked PvP.
---
Now just to figure out how to quickly unlock the masteries. 
---
Depends on the content you want. Most of the good meta stat combos come from HoT, so do 4 of the 6 raid wings. HoT will net you a glider. And the meta events in each map are still active and require mapwide group participation. 
---
The HoT maps themselves are compact and have a lot of twists, turns, and verticality.
---
Path of Fire has several mounts, the better story, but only 2 raid wings and they're two of the harder, less trained ones. Not so many meta stat combos. Not many people run the meta events, and they take little to no group participation. Someone mentioned the griffon, but the griffon is a long collection and 300g, so not something you'll get early on. 
---
The PoF maps, in my opinion, are less pretty and varied. They're pretty spread out and most of the events are pretty dead, since there's few reasons to run them. (Looking at you, desolation)
---
As someone who raids and does endgame stuff, I would say HoT. If you're more of a solo player, go with PoF.
---
Unind dyes to sell? 
---
is it just me or does it look weirdly.. unfinished?
---
because the typical pug group runs a healer and at least one condi dps. I'm not surprised by that typical experience at all. I'm just not going to recommend to join the clownfiesta because it has always been like that.
---
have you tried running in image download mode?
---
[gw2.exe -image]
---
If not, that may help.
---
power dh can provide mob control via gs pull, aegis, stability(kinda useless tbh), blinds, reflect and even quickness(albeit short-lived but the fight is phased anyway)
---
you know what groups that struggle with these bosses have in common? they don't have enough dps and get overwhelmed
---
you know what high dps groups do at this boss? burst it down before it really does anything..
---
or you can do what others said and stack up like a bunch of healing and turn a 3min fight into a 30min fight
---
btw scourge isn't carrying anything in fractals
---
Thank you! I thought that mounts are better than glider before and you pursued me, what about aestethic? IS there any option to see in game  armor/weapon sets from different dungeons (like they show sets for cristals)? Also want to see some opinion about spec for those 3 classes, which are better in pve and/or pvp content
---
I'd really recommend power weaver instead. The burst damage is awesome. 
---
Hey slashy1302,
---
First of all, I am glad you got some resolution out of it. For the others who don't know: slashy1302 contacted me a while ago to ask me whether or not those values that showed up in his logs were feasible using the spyware they used. And indeed, it turns out, that if a file can't be read for whatever reason (for example because it was running from a folder that your user account isn't allowed to read from), the spyware ended up hashing nothing, which results in the hash mentioned above.
---
My best guess, and mind you that is only a guess, is, that they added the empty hash to their blacklist on purpose to catch cheaters that protected their cheats using ACLs or sandboxes. They probably forgot, as a lot of Windows developers do, that you can't assume admin rights on Windows and that Windows is a multi-user OS and multiple users can be logged on at the same time. So if one user logs in and has some applications installed in their user profile, like Discord for example or the Twitch App, and then their spouse switches to their user and runs Guild Wars there, the user will be able to see the processes running in the different user session, but won't be able to read any of the executable images behind them, resulting in these empty hashes naturally.
---
I am not even sure that their handling of your GDRP request as you describe it is legal in that way.
---
Do you work in the US?
---
Because to me as a European this sounds like an overreaction. Just because people make mistakes, firing them doesn't necessarily solve problems. It doesn't even mean things will get better after. 
---
People can learn from mistakes they have made accidentally, that's how they gain experience. If you fire them you will have to find new people who you *hope* will do better. Feels to me like this mostly serves a false sense of justice.
---
This is not a personal attack towards you or your post, I'm just wondering if this is a cultural thing or just my personal feeling of what justice means.
---
I want to thank you again, because only after you confirmed my thoughts I was determined to go the extra mile and notify them about my findings.
---
" Now that this mess is (finally) over I am thinking about contacting some  data protection officer over in Germany and hand them my files for  further action. "
---
doing gods work, thank you!
---
Because they only hash process images (the files that were used to create those processes). You can't create a process from an empty file. The problem though is, that just because your user can see a process running, doesn't mean you are allowed to read the file that was used to spawn it.
---
The most likely scenario is, that he did not run Guild Wars 2 as an administrator (which you really shouldn't do anyway). Then a different user account (maybe his wife has an account on his system?) was logged in at the same time as his user account or maybe he has like a work user and a private user that he switches between. If the other account had some popular applications installed that install to the user profile directory, like Twitch App, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp Desktop, or anything like that, he would end up with dozens of processes that his user can see, but where his user isn't allowed to read the files associated with the processes, as they are located in a different user profile and without administrator rights you can't read inside other user's profile directories.
---
I really don't understand how someone can't get one simply because it costs 250 gold. I'ts not like you have pay it all at once, you can work on it slowly and pay 10 g here and 10 g there. Easily done over the course of a few weeks or 1-2 months.
---
Materials the shipments give are worth quite a lot. So you buy the shipments, open them and sell the mats
---
Volatile Magic is the most profitable currency to convert to gold. 250vm can make you between 70s and 1.2ish gold.
---
Actual the month I got banned made me review a lot of my views in terms what I thought of anet, hell even life, I was at bare minimum respect due to shit they did before and leaving gw1 to bots. and other woes this was what broke the camels back for me. I don't trust them and I won't forgive their scummy Nexon ways the only good thing about it now is that certain devs got fired/left and somewhere responsible for the most money grabbing greed crap the game has, Still no excuse and this whole thing needs to become more public like before
---
Curious, what sort of tweaks? I'm actually trying out that build (although I'm only in my 20s, so it's obviously still pretty basic, only have Chaos right now). I'm leveling it kind of alongside the other big recommended one, the minion necro, to see which I like better.

Glint is a supportive elite spec that focuses on sharing boons, it also enhances other legends by providing some sort of passive effect via facet of nature.
---
Shield 4 offers less protection than guardian shield 4 which also adds an aegis. But it does an aoe heal for 1600-2100 (from 0-1000healing power) and if traited it also removes 1 condition from targets.
---
Shield 5 blocks all incoming dmg for 3 seconds just like warrior shield does. But it also heals you for 2480-4500 (from 0-1000Healing power) AND if traited it removes up to 4 conditions from you.
---
Yes it roots you, , it doesnt reflect projectiles and it has a 5s more cd compared to a traited shield mastery from warrior.
---
But do we really need to have all sorts of effects shared across all profession?

Does this mean that a thrown shield 4 on heralds should also stun foes like engineers do? Or shield 5 on herald to knock back all foes? Why not also add some vuln and perhaps also weakness on all foes struck on top of it all!
---
Not all professions should have the same effects on all skills, and not all skills should be perfect and meta and able to counter all sorts of things in all gamemodes.   
---
People arent using banner of defense in pvp, does that mean it needs a complete rework?
---
Like you said already, "why use shield over a offhand sword anyway" , so go ahead and use a offhand sword then if it outperforms shield in pvp.
---
Herald shield 5 roots you cause its a skill Glint used, it has its animation, theme and style and it saved a lot of people in pve if used properly, just like well timed deathstrike saved a lot of people in pvp
---
I see I don't meet a lot of sympathizers, because everyone here loves how the people need a little mommy to guide them step by step trough the game because they can't do anything on there own and are more likely to ask questions they could answer themselves if they would just spend 1 min atleast trying to find an answer. 
---
Alright lads I see.. 
---
I had to mention this, have a nice day everyone
---
Hate: Domain of Kourna, the Matchmaker heart.
---
Another one I love: Main Temple of Kormir heart. Love healing the NPCs.
---
I had the same experience, I contacted them in June 17th, 2017 (pre gdpr) and got my data on May 30, 2018. It also only included my address + name + email + phone numbers + IPs. No DoB even though it sits right there when I log into my account and is needed to be verified by support. I didn't bother following up on it since the initial request was pre gdpr.

Are you drunk?

Guardian and Warrior, more specifically berserker can both get to 100% burn duration without any expertise, since they have traits that increase their burn duration. And the rest you can gain with runes (like [Balthazar runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Balthazar) for example) and a [Superior Sigil of Smoldering](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Smoldering). It won't increase their bleed duration of course, but burn damage in both cases is their main source of condition damage, so it'll work well enough, and you can use it with Carrion, Rampager, or Dire gear.
---
i would stop taking the game seriously and start taking the piss if i got suspended for 3 days because i bought cooking mats for karma and crafted them then sold them for gold. that's not even an exploit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxb-anRWHrA&amp;t=233s
---
if i was just starting and that happened to me, i would just start taking the piss too. a game that will suspend me for using the mechanics, as intended, to make gold is not something i would want to waste my time with.
---
Any Condition Firebrand build can hit 100% without Vipers. Just get all the condition duration from runes/sigils/food/utility. So the gear could be Grieving/Carrion/Rampagers ... etc.
---
Unind. Dyes sill currenty for 10s and dropping.
---
Week and months of Playing WvW would only be 327g.
---
Na dude.
---
OK sorry if this is a dumb question but I'm a bit of a ludite.
---
What is this "empty" thing that caused the false positive?? Is it something we should be concerned about that could be on our computers without our knowledge and result in a banning??
---
Again sorry if it's a dumb question but I know Jack about coding etc
---
rampagers, hmm. do they have some critical proc to produce conditions?
---
Thisis gonna sound weird, but if the affected people actually really werent alot and the thing has blown over, i believe most companies would just silently unlock the accounts and not go out of their way to make their mistake public. I have to hand it on Anet on this one. „Make good „ Value aside, just making it public like that is not that self explanatory imho
---
&gt; Running solo attacking a solo target in the open world, I’ve never been able to do more than maybe 10-12k as a burst and maybe 7-8k sustained.
---
Most of those high benchmark dps charts are a.) on a target that doesn't move and doesn't attack you, meaning you won't have to dodge or pay any attention to more than just your rotation; and b.) are with all buffs included, the difference between having quickness and alacrity as opposed to having neither, or having 25 might stacks versus only a few (both scenarios are often the case when going solo) can make a big difference. That said, yeah some people just stroke their dps dicks way too much to be healthy for the raiding environment, confusing "viable" with "optimal" and whatnot. 
---
You can always try to get into one of the raid training communities, most if not all of them have a discord. You can check [this website](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) to get an overview on them. Through a friend I managed to get into someone's raid group every blue moon, but eventually I decided to get into the Raiders in Training discord (NA) and managed to get good groups for the most part, and was able to learn a lot.
---
Both expansions bring content and areas designed for max level (80) so don’t feel too rushed to get them right now. I do really suggest getting both expansions if you can, they go on sale pretty often up to 50%. Right now [DL Gamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) has the package for 38% off which isn’t bad. If you are set on one expansion personally I’d get HoT, it has more content, comes first story wise and has a lot of repeatable stuff to do even if it’s the mastery bonus isn’t quite as nice as mounts. People did manage just fine without mounts for years and thief in particular actually has a ton of mobility, try using a short bow and the #5 skill and giving yourself swiftness.
---
Could you sue Anet for having now to pay for a child you wouldn't have had if you would've been able to game instead?  
---
I bet you could.
---
&gt;Arenanet is famous for its incredibly helpful customer support,
---
After 14 years of gw1 and gw2 i can only say: What?! 
---
I had most of my horror support stories with NCSOFT/ArenaNet support. There are some exceptions that usually get posted on this subreddit, but they are just that. Exceptions.
---
Two times I had the exact same support queries as people who posted here about how good support is and got slammed down at first. It was always only after I posted them those Reddit posts that they gave in and helped me.
---
1.) Refine them into bolts
---
2.) Profit
---
Glider is for gliding, doesnt help much for speed, raptor is for speed on flat surfaces. Thing is, with pof you dont just get raptor, you have 5 other mounts you could get that are very differet mechanicaly. 
---
Thief has daredevil and deadeye elite spec, daredevil is melee brawler with a staff, its great and fun and mobile, deadeye is kinda the opposite, its not mobile but it has great ranged dps and a rifle. 
---
Warrior has berserker and spellbreaker, berserker is basically a fire barabarian with a torch and spellbreaker is a "mage-killer", in gw2 its basically a debuffer, its absolutely great for pvp. Uses daggers. 
---
Not sure what you mean by your last question, all guilds North America guilds are joinable by anyone unless they are WvW specific guilds. All the worlds are put in togheter in the game, youll see people from different worlds all the time, the only place where worlds matter is WvW. 
---
I said IF they were as low as Anet said. I obviously dont know. And im not trying to justify the compensation. Im just saying there wouldve been an easy way out here for anet (albeit a bad one) and they didnt take it
---
You have fought well, irregardless
---
They investigated due to a request that was made with more information on their mistake
---
Ask support, they'll help you. 
---
Holosmith, Chrono or Dragon hunter for PVE? (Open world, meta events, fractals, raiding, etc) I have only power ascended trinkets so choosing a power class would make sense. 
---
Usually in groups with both Druid and Chrono they both take the same one don't they? 
---
Let's make a science based, 100% dragon MMO.
---
Fair to point, anet was never superb in the communications aspect. Screening words is common place. Shut up and stay banned. 
---
- 9 months later -
---
Woops, we're sorry, hope you forgive us *slaps 50 dollars in your face*
---
Ok so you're happy.. righhht?
---
I love playing versatile professions that can do various things even if not using specific stat set ups (or the ones that go well with full marshal gear).
---
The ones that can dps, deal condi, heal, offer boons, support, add utility such as blocks, projectile reflection/absorption, even portals and stealth
---
In order it would be something like:
---
* Guardian: Can dps, condi burst, heal, boon share, projectile absorption and reflection, and a plus bonus for having sword/shield combo and GS for Eternity
---
* Revenants: Can dps, condi burst, heal, boon share, projectile absorption, sword/shield combo, an interesting energy mechanic, loads of cc
---
* Elementalists: Can dps, has some condies, has loads of heals, some boon sharing, loads of aoe, conjures are fun, meteor shower is super fun
---
Other professions i like (in no particular order) but dont have as much as the 3 above are :
---
* Thief: Tho squishy, playing a profession that cant simply leap into 5 mobs and cleave everything around him till its dead is super refreshing. The playstyle makes you focus on things you pretty much ignored when playing warriors or guardians. The dual attacks, stealth attacks, stealth in general, initiative system is also refreshing.
---
* Necromancer: Be it core, burst reaper or condi scourge, playing as a "dark" tough, almost invincible caster that has an army of minions that can solo anything is pretty fun.
---
* Rangers: Searching and collecting your pets, and looking at new ones when a new expansion comes is a game on its own. The weapon arsenal rangers have is also a wide range of themes and abilities. From evasive burst greatswords, evasive quick swords, long bow long range bursts, to medium range conditions with shortbow that relies on positioning, a torch to light up dark caves.... and even utilities are pretty fun, actual traps, pet command shouts, nature spirits, and various survival skills.
---
* Warriors: With max armor/health, plenty of regeneration,100% vengeance, loads of immunity, and a large amount of offensive support, its probably the only profession that makes me feel taller than any elder dragon in the game. Tho most of their skills are "raw" and simplistic, they do stand out among a mass amount of magical weapons / attacks and spells. 
---
Tho i do like some aspects of engineer and mesmer, i could never get into those professions. 
---
Engineers has more "weird" and "loony" skills than i would like to have on a profession.
---
And mesmer skills, tho very very very useful and powerful...they are just all over the place and feels like a big mess. Not saying people cant play mesmers well, im just talking about my personal "feel" when im playing the profession
---
There are a few t4 fractals where agony doesnt really matter or can be „outplayed“ its been a while but a friend got an ascened set on a smurf by just playing t4 with our guild. Obviously söow and not puggable, also not a good idea when not experienced with fracs. 
---
Oh that's a good point. I don't get the full effect when it's just a screenshot. Thanks!
---
Gonna say.. build up indubitably best. The answer mechanics of the fight, gotta be one of the worst. Best fights are done in raids, hands down. However, the company that you play with determines all, which is the biggest risk.
---
yesterday I received a ban of 2k of hours, I am reading the reports and extremely disappointed with ANET, they are going to lose a lot with these false positives! I'm the casual type guy who plays 2 to 4 hours a week! game gw2 precisely because it is an extremely casual game, where I will not be back playing a few hours. unfortunate it!
---
Yeah, but I can't always count on having a chrono :(
---
Wow this is insane. Unbelievable how little recourse the average players have against these companies. Its b.s. we spend a ton of time, effort and money but these games can just shutdown our accounts with no proof! Unfair!
---
Jeez.. and here we're asking the legendary armor to get another dye channel haha
---
Thinking of the value of daily fractals and weekly raids over that many months, then comparing it to 2500 gems. Yikes.
---
I have to take LFG side on this.
---
LFG explicitly asked for LI and LD, nothing else. No KP, no legendary items, no titles, no minis or any other kind of KP.
---
Legendary armor is made of LI, but it does not matter in this case. LI is LI. LFG asked for LI. LI as itself.
---
If LFG would have said "LI and/or legendary items", then linking legendary items would have been valid.
---
LFG makers have the right to ask whatever they want and they have the right to kick people who do not meet requirements. They also have the right not to answer whispers if someone gets salty after kick.
---
Precursor is not KP.
---
I think this is more like "can't read" problem.
---
Would this be fine to go through the Open World stuff? I heard the HoT maps were quite hard? Or should I spec for Berserker gear? 
---
Hello, I have been in 400li W1 groups who couldn't get VG down after 10 tries, but somehow they managed to kill Gorse and Sab on the first try.
---
This is getting out of hand.  Now there are two of them.
---
101 Household uses for Brandstone, the next hot book right off the presses.
---
\&gt; 8 skills does remove much of the mechanical skill component 
---
No it doesn't. You have to use those skills well. 
---
\&gt;  you really don't have to micro the AI.  
---
You do if you don't want them to use up their interrupts on anything that isn't Rodgort's Invocation, which wipes your party easily, if you want your heroes to actually keep up with you because for whatever reason they run faster if you flag them to you as opposed to normally following. 
---
\&gt;  In GW2 you still have to actually do something. 
---
That's not really true for most of GW2's content.
---
\&gt; I suggest you try the mission again and see how it really isn't that big of a deal at all. People can do the mission with henchmen. 
---
They can but it is easy? No. I wiped literally upwards on 20 times on Hell's Precipice before even getting close to the area with the portals before I resolved to get heroes. AI monks can't heal for shit and AI ritualists just kill themselves with their sacrifice skills. 
---
Yeah.
---
"Facts" that you don't actually presents.
---
"B-but most of your matches in every MMO you played had AFKS or bots"
---
Great facts you present. Get out of here.
---
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/gaming/guild-wars-2-monitored-all-running-process-in-order-to-ban-users/
---
best time to pug t4s is right at reset. Also, KP isn't that for CMS? just look for t4 groups and not CMs. there are plenty of groups at reset that want to do just t4s and maybe daily recommended; at least on NA
---
It's new but it's most likely it's because of the terrain change because polish is way too low to be anything of significance.
---
t4 fractals become swamp in last 2 month for some reason,ppl have no idea what to do,how to deal dmg......
---
The 5 shield is used in raids though.
---
Nothing carries harder than Minstrel/Harrier Firebrand. Perma-Protection/Regen/Retal, significant Aegis and Stability, high Resistance and Vigor, and solid offensive boons on top of projectile bubbles and enormous healing potential. Staff and Bow of Truth give ranged healing if people get out of position as well. Your personal damage will be poor, but I've carried 4-DPS teams with 10k total team DPS through T4s repeatedly with that build. No matter how slow your team is, that build can hold them together as long as they don't straight-up run away from your healing.
---
The funny thing is that we used to have a major issue with getting cloth back between Season 1 and Season 2. Then they added a dozen means to get cloth easily, but then added a bazillion means to use wood, ore, and leather but not cloth...
---
How retarded are you?
---
1) Toss on mule / personal guild bank
---
2) Wait for Festival of the Four Winds
---
3) Turn in for lootboxes
---
4) profit???
---
I'm a vet player, what do I do with all this bloodstone dust?
---
ok nice, you still have enough to buy exotics with less than 10g, some karma, or dungeon tokens, which you can use for 3 of the 4 pieces of content. you can make around 15g in 2h with dungeons alone which means you can make the gold for the griffon in less than half an month with your playtime. So stop making excuses for yourself and start collecting gear, doing content, and being efficient if you want the gold
---
feed it to herta 
---
So you can get banned for no reason other than Anet's own incompetency, and then they won't even look into the problem, they will just accuse you and tell you are a liar and a cheater. I never thought the support could be this level of bad, my every interaction with them was quick and nice. This is a huge slap in the face. I have almost 9000 hours in the game since 2012 december, but this makes me worry on a serious level.
---
Thats not even true. The material to gold value of the lower level dungeons is insane. 
---
They didn't raise the cost of making bolts. They just reduced the drop rate of bolts (by making it so that only light armor classes could get them reliably). People outraged, and they added a dozen means to farm cloth, the most common of which is... Silverwaste chests. Which remains the most profitable farm because of other drops, resulting in the easy cloth from them dropping in price.
---
Meanwhile, they increased the usage of the wood, ore, and leather a hundred times over since then, while rarely if ever touching the need of cloth, without really adding new means to get those drops.
---
ok but you wanna know what my MOST stupid new person thing was?
---
i bought every single legendary tribute i could get my hands on because i was like "well, it's legendary... sounds important" 
---
my stupid ass bought a legendary tribute to arah before facing zhaitan "just in case i'll need it"
---
There is some sort of love-hate relationship between me and that crafting system. While it's certainly cool that it's some sort of mini game it sometimes feels like everything below 100% HQ chance is equal to 0% :D
---
Depends. If you're aiming to craft Ascended gear, then you're going to want to refine a bit into Bloodstone Brick.
---
Otherwise, you want to avoid refining and feed them (and empyreal shards and dragonite ore) to [converters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter).
---
I don't know what to think about it. Should I be glad they admit they made a mistake, or should I be worried they did such a huge mistake for 9 months. Even if it's virtual, video games are product we own when we buy them. If people use third party plugins or whatever to cheat, you should warn them before taking such drastic decision. It reminds me one of my friend with League of legends. His account has been stolen and someone used a script for a couple of games. When I saw him online, I was confused by the way he talked to me so I messaged him. He instantly changed his password BUT still got banned. Riot support was so awful. As I recall he spent a lot of $ to buy cosmetics etc. Customer support should be better, especially in video games
---
Hmm. Thanks. Looks like I might want to put some more thought into finding a guild - I am already eyeing guilds I come across but actually being in a nice guild would certainly make pvp more fun and.. well.. it would get me into fractals.
---
I tend to be a bit of a hoarder (you know, keeping things just in case I need or want them) so those last two may be a bit of an issue. But I suppose could sell some excess materials I have stored in my bank as I'd still have those materials in storage.
---
Feel free to drop some of those ectos, mithril, and elder wood on me. I'll be more than happy to take em. :)
---
Between agreements basically consenting to giving up your firstborn, automated/underpaid "report reviewers", in-game currencies to obscure how much you actually spend, and loot boxes...how did we not notice the predatory actions of gaming companies skyrocketing in recent years?
---
Was it a "frog in boiling water" situation, as in we didn't see it because it was incremental? Or did the "abuse of position" start almost all at once as all these systems got into place, and as customers we just went along for the ride because, well, what choice did we have in the matter?
---
I get that business is business, and every company is seeking a profit, but how did gaming get to this point comparatively?
---
Thank you for your feedback!
---
I just wanted to point out how important is to read LFG and meet its requirements. Literally.
---
apparently the original planned ending to pof was going to be much different but maybe they made some major changes when we were all complaining about how likely it is their solution to years and years of build up will be some absolutely shoe-horned deus ex bs off the tip of some minor detail they forgot to flesh out in gw1 so they had some leg room with interpretation. That was the mindset for a little while before PoF came out especially with how people felt they handled your character's participation in the last two living world episodes of season 3, maybe more-so the fifth one than the sixth for me. Honestly the entire future of this game is riding on the finale, otherwise nobody will be excited for season 5. i really hope they were right when they said it was going to blow our minds lol
---
&gt; One of the stories written in some of the gaming media on the first or second day of GW2's launch was that they were issuing permanent bans for violations of the character naming policy, and I'm not talking about offensive names.
---
Lol that attitude certainly changed in recent years. I reported someone multiple times over a few months for the word boobs/tits in their name (in Hungarian, but can't be mistaken for another word in any other language), and only ever got copy-paste replies from support saying that they don't have any issue with it. When I asked if they say it would be fine for me to name a character Boobs-something in English too, they didn't answer, and I couldn't be bothered to spend more energy on their hypocrisy D: (This from a company, that doesn't allow the word "gay" in character names.)
---
God yes. I love the aesthetic of using the shield, but I found it pretty useless in PvE. I’d love to have a better 4 skill. 
---
thats 16 days every year. You can easily make more than 250g in 16 days when you know how to spend your 2 hours
---
&gt;one of the most important thing about MMORPG is the story
---
So one of the most important things for you is a thing that most MMORPGs in general are quite bad at? 
---
&gt;Maybe I was expecting too much and probably because I set Runescape as a benchmark.
---
Unless they changed Runescape drastically the last year or so, this comment seems really weird. As far as I remember there were barely any story in Runescape at all, other than to explain the different parts of the game mechanics? 
---
&gt;If it’s so easy as to just dodge, go play it yourself then. And lose to anyone who actually plays the class.
---
The answer to mirage is to play mirage, but better. 
---
I think the loss of [Soothing Bastion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soothing_Bastion) was a negative for the usability of the shield on Herald. It's designed as a support weapon, but doesn't really offer enough support to justify using in most circumstances now. That 25% boon uptime gave the shield skills a lot more value that just wasn't accounted for in the rework.
---
I would love to participate , I`m experienced with raids ( 400 + LI ) but took a break from the game and came back this last episode. I too had a chill group back then. Send me an invite in game OnizukaBR.8537
---
Hi all, I plan to make a holosmith. I have never played an engineer before and I plan to use the level 80 boost on it. Is it recommend? If not what kinda build should I do before I unlock holosmith? And bonus question: what's the best looking race for holosmith?
---
I tried updating windows7 since I hadn't in a while after reinstalling / updating all my drivers etc. Didn't work. However! I've decided to reinstall the game yesterday, which at least so f ar (it's still installing, at this point just barely "playable") has resulted in me not crashing. I wonder if this will change once the game is fully installed. 
---
You could also build a Core warrior for bleeds only, capping bleed duration is easy with Bloodlust trait, Runes of Krait and Sigil of Agony.
---
I think it needs reworking, but I really wouldn't want them to do that under a PvP-centric approach.
---
Because - and I don't mean this in a bad way at all - PvE is a bit too large and too active to base skill designs on the comparatively tiny PVP IMO.
---
Yeah true. Someone did make a program to make gw2 run with dx12 on win10 at least, but I doubt that'd fix this error as it seems to be a gw2 rather than Dx9 thing or anything else. Sucks but what are we gonna do about it. 
---
I hope all people who got their accounts back got all the missing dailies marked as done in their accounts and they also got all the daily rewards!
---
You use LFG, and you specify what you want in the description.
---
if you have nothing in description people will assume youre a pro, and youre looking for speedclears, and generally speaking you will get those kind of players in.
---
Occasionally you will get a player under lvl 80, or a complete newbie that generally people kick out and then those people come on reddit saying how do i find a party for a dungeon ?
---
Im really not sure whats the deal with your latins ... I just place on LFG "TA P1,2,3" anyone welcome, ask everyone from all of my guilds if they wanna join up and i get a group within 1-10 minutes max.
---
most of the time we arent meta,and most of the times i quickly explain what to do, and most of the time we finish the run without continuous wiping, rage quitting and stress :)
---
&gt;dps = dps
---
Oh shit, is that what that means?
---
There are a few different ways to support and some are more "worth" than others depending on where you use them.
---
Thief group stealth is amazing in most dungeons and some fractals for skipping trash mobs, and they also offer almost prema aoe blind which pretty much negates all trash mob dmg (under right conditions)
---
Guardians offer all sorts of boons, loads of tiny packets of heal, projectile absorption and reflects as well as a lot of quickness (which makes people cast and attack 50% faster).
---
Warriors offer a lot of offensive support ,increasing overall dmg across the entire team.
---
Rangers have a similar share of warriors overall offensive support, but as druids they also offer some nice burst heals. People usually take druids as it has a good combo of heals and offensive support.
---
Elementalist tempest have some great dps as well as loads of strong heals and a few boon shares.
---
Revenant heralds can share a ton of boons almost permanently across all party members. Ventary has some of the strongest heals as well as offering alacrity, but people rarely use it as it can be hard and "clunky" to use ventari tablet in some areas of the game. Renegades however offer a great amount of easy alacrity, some nice aoe heal every now and then as well as a good dps increase and healing with life steal and all that comes with some good condi damage on top.
---
However, mesmers, chronos in specific ,have surely the largest set of support abilities and skills. 
---
From stealth, hard cc, quickness, alacrity, blocks, projectile reflects, portals and even some healing. It also has some major roles in all raids since the beginning of raids.
---
If youre not very serious or strict and meta, ask your self where would you like to support.
---
For open world pve anything goes really, so play whatever makes you feel more satisfying. 
---
Pick elementalist or revenant if you like seeing large green numbers, or perhaps guardian for a mix of healing, protection and quickness/might/fury sharing.
---
For dungeons pick thief for group stealth to quickly pass dungeons and speed clear them (which most people do now days with dungeons). Or if you wish to perma blind a ton of trash mobs by pulling them all behind a wall where your group stacked (which is what most people do now days in dungeons).
---
Or pick revenants for dungeons and fractals that offer great burst heals, a very long moving projectile barrier, strong cc  and a large amount of boon sharing
---
For raids, chronomancer, druid, warrior are the best support, and generally speaking you can use and apply the same abilities and benefits in fractals, dungeons and open world pve.
---
&gt; one of the most important thing about MMORPG is the story
---
...yea, fuck the gameplay or anything else...
---
&gt; because I set Runescape as a benchmark
---
...yep, fuck the gameplay or anything else...
---
I have an important question for you: have you ever tried reading a book?
---
Got a problem? Solve it with Gems©️ because you literally CAN'T play this game without being indirectly asked or pressed for MORE of the real world cash you ALREADY spent on it! Even the other players know this! Come on, dummy!!! 😜
---
Personal story is a series of missions instanced and devided in chapters that you unlock every 10 lvls. Youre free to do them and i dont know why youre afraid of trying them out
---
Constructive criicism! Most of which was negative feedback.
---
Well. Not really. You can farm gold to buy gems and you can create guilds and upgrade storage. 
---
I enjoy them all but I have been pretty basic and playing on Humans lately and bit of Asura..
---
Humans, Asura, Charr and Norn all have storylines that at lvls10,20 and 30 is whatever choices you pick, relevant to the race and culture, and after lvl30 they all merge in one single storyline which is where you first hear about Zhaitan and such and such..
---
Sylvari however being a newer race in Tyria are all about the Elder Dragons so the implementation of the story there and Zhaitan and the threats happens much better, more naturally and from lvl10, so you have a clearer idea. 
---
I have a solution for u. Send some to me, i don't play much and i am always low on it for the craft, even need to skip it like every 2nd-3rd day ;)
---

As a person who hasn't played in many many years and is thinking of coming back. I have no idea what this means haha
---
I guess as with raids the 'barrier' to get into T4 is a lot higher than it needs to be. CM sure I get the requirements for that...
---
The reliance on the benchmark guild websites with regards to group composition, builds and rotations is absolutely absurd and the amount of players just in it for quick gold is a bit sad. 
---
If you want to go at it alone I would say check out one of those sites, see if your class fits in a meta, learn it as well as you can and try your luck in a group you might get some groups willing to let you tag along without all the requirements (if you want to shine you will need food and pots). If you impress add a few names to your friends list and ask if they'd invite you next time, mate of mine did it this way and made his way up to T4s. 
---
A much easier way is to find a friendly or training guild express your interest, participate, learn and progress.
---
If you play a dps class, maybe get arcdps, see how you fair compared to the benchmarks and maybe tweak your playstyle a bit.
---
don't be silly i never cry about anything or i would be a hypocrite
---
Fair enough.
---
Engineer would probably be the least played profession. 
---
Core engineers are there mostly because of all the free2play people and people who are leveling the engi up.
---
Holosmith engies are "new and shiny" and actually have a strong punch in terms of dps
---
However scrapper falls behind. It has some useful abilities but other professions offer better ones. And Holosmith offers better dps for solo exploration i guess.
---
&gt; Anet, who otherwise seem (to me, at least) to keep a good relationship with customers
---
I take you never had to contact their support before?
---
Love it 👏
---
The real carrying in fractals comes from being self-sufficient. Support classes can do a lot of good for a struggling group, but there really is only so much you can do to support your allies.
---
Instead, take a build that can handle itself without needing to rely on others to do their job. In this respect, power Chrono is what you want:
---
- Excellent burst.
---
- Able to give itself 25 might, ~80% fury uptime, ~50% vigor uptime, and high uptimes on quickness, alacrity, and swiftness.
---
- Mob pull with focus.
---
- Great cleave.
---
- High CC.
---
- Solid survivability.
---
- Portals and blinks for skips.
---
- Stealth.
---
- Reflects.
---
- Boon strip.
---
- Continuum split allowing you to skip mechanics or survive things that would otherwise oneshot you.
---
This really is the best carry class in the game for fractals. In inexperienced groups, you'll get DPS numbers [like](https://imgur.com/a/pjG1ayR) [these](https://imgur.com/a/PCbct8M). You can carry people through things they struggle with using portal skips and stealth. Anywhere that reflects help, you can slot feedback into your bar. You can solo pretty much anything in the game with it, including CMs. I can go on.
---
Power chrono is the best pugging class for fractals, hands down.
---
2 questions you should ask yourself before judging the players that criticize/leave your group(s).
---
* Did your group advertise as exp?
---
* Did your group insist on "kp" pings?
---
Account Name?
---
So Episode 5 ending comic when? :P
---
I gave you the names of the games, what other facts do you need more you dipshit.
---
You dont even give facts yourself, actual moron
---
Silk, Elder Wood Log, Mithril Ore and Thick Leather Section are those what fill up my inventory very quickly.
---
I just sell them at TP after they reach full stack (250).
---
There is more! Bloodstone Dust I throw away instantly. Dragonite Ore and Empyreal Fragments go to converter (karka/star) after reaching full stack (250).
---
Aww that's adorable &lt;3
---
Need to do a map, a specific heart, talk to an NPC, and kill a specific NPC as the relevant profession. Rest can be done by anyone I believe.
---
Problem is they banned people that didn't have any "dodgy shit open" as you've put it. They were banned due to (possibly) a coding error in their detection routines. And their support isn't good, it's horrible when it comes to this. They refused to look into it, said they are 100% certain and closed the tickets stating that further tickets will be closed without response.
---
I'll take your silk, can I have it for free?
---
This seems like a lot of fun :D
---
Much obliged.
---
If you have a second character who completed HoT, you can do the Caladbolg again but need to craft the components you got from the collection. Still crafting but different stuff.
---
There's the elite spec collections, which will require the related profession for \~4 things.
---
Then there's vendors via WvW, sPvP, raid, and fractals.
---
Do you play any pvp? Shield on rev is just bad end of story. No it doesn't have to be the same as warrior shield or engi shield neither has it to be useful everywhere but as it is now it's bad across the board.
---
Yeah I had a tag yell at me for following their group in WvW too, I stick to roaming now. 
---
weird flex but ok
---
I mean the story is pretty bad, has ups and downs.  I feel like if you're playing MMOs for the story then you shouldn't be playing MMOs though.
---
This. Sell Unidentified Dyes at TP. I have been doing that since day 1 when Skirmish Chests were introduced.
---
As one of the people that often leaves pugs quickly, why do I want to bash my head against a boss for an hour just to carry half the pug, and, being a pug, I don't know any of them.
---
&gt;OnizukaBR.8537
---
Fair comment, 
---
As stated we don't take things as serious as most.
---
Advertised 50LI I believe. 
---
We leave this to one of the guys that's more experienced  fair enough, 3 of us had to swap characters and gear though, just needed some time DH and druid play quite differently. 
---
Thanks for your input though, helps to clear things up.
---
The problem with the past three fractals has been condi spam and add spam. They need to stop doing that or give more classes the ability to effectively cleave and cleanse. Right now the only real counter is scourge which was already op.
---
in a nutshell, ignorant elitism
---
Well....if we visit the place where kralkatorik slept and woke up and decided to brand everything around him and fly down south.....then surely there should be SOME brand around the area no?
---
And im pretty sure if they DONT add a single branded crystal in the zone (or too few) people would be outraged by the lack of branded and create  a billion posts on reddit how "out of touch" anet is with their own lore and world building...
---
Depends on what you're looking for, really.
---
If it's balance, then a lot of balance changes occur every 3-6 months. So those guides die out. If it's pathing and NPC mechanics, then in general it doesn't matter since ArenaNet rarely changes old content unless there's a game breaking bug / exploit.
---
The reason this got resolved so incredibly long after the banwave and the reason this matter never got blown up and caught a lot of attention is because we were ignored by support dozens of times despite having the best proof we could get a hold of as people who are not great with tech/pcs etc, yet still tried. Each time we tried writing about it here on this part of reddit or on the forums, we were once again silenced. This happened so incredibly many times over a course of months after the banwaves until most of us lost hope in receiving any attention or help whatsoever from support, to the point we backed away and had to let this be. Which is a horrible thing, especially as support DOES exist for this game and most of us had a good history with them prior this, and yet there was no support to be received in any possible way.
---
Only reason this happened now and not earlier, from what I've heard, is because one of the other banned players kept pushing this forward and eventually managed to slap Anet in the face with straight up proof. In other words, Anet never chose to investigate this on their own, which only decreases my already non-existent respect for the company.
---
I propably got off track writing this but I am just so pissed and tired of this company after this, soon to be, year. 
---
Will do as soon as I'm home mate, just trying to finish off some reports for work, should be done in 2 hours.
---
They should strive for all weapons to be useful in all game modes. The fact that they are not currently means nothing.
---
Yep, Support Firebrand build with Minstrels and/or Harriers brings a shit ton of healing and boons, it won't cap might or give fury, but it will keep people alive if they aren't completely hopeless.
---
The story is actually pretty good! As someone that comes from GW1 (remember GW2 is a sequel and continues the story), the story is good. I love it. So much back history in GW2. So many old faces I remember in GW1.
---
So far, the story is great. The story was a little weak in core and HoT. But PoF is a lot better.
---
GW2 story continues to get better since release, so I'm extremely hopeful of the future story wise.
---
It seems to have been a really common bug lately — all over the game. I've been fortunate enough not to get it so far so I haven't looked into any fixes.
---
Not even datamined?
---
i dont have any problem with mithil, any milthril i get are used to feed my legendary collecting hobby, i never get enough mithrils&gt;\_&gt;
---
Get a healer get a dps support (chrono/quickness/Alac Renegade) and 3 dps that have a decent build and equipment, then youre good. Heal support FB with Quickness FB and Alax Renegade areeee loads of fun. You don't need a meta build just people need to understand a bit how their class works and how gearing works. When you can do succesfully T4 fracs, you can also start raiding (I find raiding easier than T4 fracs.)
---
Creating a batch file with something like this would allow you to let it download during the night.
---
    :loop
---
    start "" "D:\Games\Guild Wars 2\Gw2.exe" /image

    timeout 300
---
    taskkill /F /IM Gw2.exe
---
    goto loop
---
I'm kinda freaked out at the moment tho, haven't seen it anywhere other than this scene so far.
---
Most likely in 1 hour &amp; 35 minutes.
---
I would love to join your group ! I have around 50 Li, I know your bosses (and a few others, but yours are the one I know the best), and I would like to raid weekly again with a nice guild :) I'm not an hardcore player, but I love raids, I just find them way more fun with people I know, especially when I can try new things \^\^
---
Feel free to invite me if you're interested : domainedepona.5263.
---
Sorry quite new here. What is KP?
---
I appreciate the information. I’ll definitely check out the discord channel. Take care.
---
i want them to add a mobile block skill
---
Elementalist casts Chain Lightning.  It's super effective!
---
WOW you gave me NAMES!!!
---
You want facts? How about the way those PvP games actually worked?
---
How about the fact that Ragnarok Online had a huge lobby with 10 NPC's for each 10 levels before you actully started the PvP itself?
---
Or the fact that Aion had open world PvP and had the Abyss which was a huge three layered map with castles to conquer?
---
You didn't present any fact. You just spilled some assisine bullshit without presenting anything and you expect people to agree with you.
---
Hehehe... Everybody really wants to see Tengu in the Game as a selectable race. Actually it would be fun to see new races in the game, in terms of balance it wouldn't be too much of a pain since almost no one uses racial skills in end content ... 
---
Loving the hype though. 
---
Was data mined earlier! Item code is def around.
---
I just checked, 6 out of the 14 tasks must be done with the relevant profession, but the other 8 have little gameplay attached to them, so most of the gameplay to complete the collection must be done using the relevant profession.
---
I had this happen last week when making a female iron legion charr.
---
After getting all our negative thoughts and the obligatory "as a customer I'm thinking twice about spending more money / switching games / filing a lawsuit" out of the way, let's acknowledge that they publicly admitted their mistake and are taking and/or took steps to remedy the situation as best as they can.
---
It sucks, but they don't deflect and take responsibility.
---
Similar question, do you advertise for a full wing? 
---
If you advertise for W4, pugs expect you'll do deimos. If you advertise for W1, pugs expect you'll do sab. Many players prefer not to have to look for a seperate "sab" or "deimos" on LFG.
---
If you then struggle on cairn it's obvious deimos isn't happening. 
---
No other occurrence since?
---
&gt; So one of the most important things for you is a thing that most MMORPGs in general are quite bad at?
---
Yeah I don't get this, MMOs are a bad place for stories because a good story almost always has a conclusion to a conflict, an *ending*. MMOs can't do that unless the plan is 'go into maintenance mode early'. 
---
WoW was okay until WotLK (judging from an outsider's perspective, feel free to correct me), TOR kinda got crappy when they fucked Revan's story up and couldn't let the Emperor RIP (Infinite Empire shenanigans), and those two are probably some of the better story-rich MMOs out there.
---
GW2... well, I've never been convinced it has a good story. It goes from badddddd to meh, but ArenaNet has never convinced me they know how to do good storytelling.
---
But going back to the initial point, MMOs are not a good place to tell a story. Best to stick to single-player games for that.
---
&gt; I think my biggest problem with this is how against re-investigating bans they are
---
because every account that gets banned or suspended proclaims its innocence and demands a full inquiry to clear them of this great injustice.
---
&gt; If they just worked with the people appealing instead of saying no and closing tickets this mess would have been solved much earlier.
---
..and support would have months-long queues as the system clogs up with endless appeals.
---
If you get upset by insignificant stuff like that I don't want you in my party anyways
---
&gt; Now that this mess is (finally) over I am thinking about contacting some data protection officer over in Germany and hand them my files for further action.
---
Please do. Their behaviour is completely unacceptable here and you are very well positioned to submit a fantastically detailed report over their disastrous handling of their GDPR obligations.
---
&gt; I cant sit here all day waiting for the right group to need me.
---
There's your problem. You can't just sit around hoping someone takes you, you need to actually be proactive
---
The crafting and trading post systems are two of the main reasons why I ended up ditching FFXIV and coming back to GW2. There's a lot that I loved about FFXIV, but some of the stuff - like gathering, crafting, trading - drove me round the twist. 
---
Although I won't pretend; the subscription fee is also a major turn off. I can't justify that expenditure. 
---
Pretty sure you misquoted that quote.
---
It is highly unlikely that you are the only one with this problem.
---
Idk it seems quite believable to be. But obviously we should always take leaks with a pinch of salt unless there's irrefutable proof. 
---
However, I'd be really worried if we didn't get more expansions and getting elite specs with living story updates would heavily imply that. Oh well. Time will tell.
---
What third tree would you recommend? Especially while leveling I certainly won't have Mirage. I was tempted to use my level 80 boost from purchasing PoF when it came out but I don't really like using those as a general rule.
---
Cuuuute!
---
They used to do AMAs here, but after certain controversies they've moved to forum 'celebrations', where you're not really allowed to ask everything you'd want without being infracted. Many devs still do read reddit, but they engage less. 
---
Playing MMORPs for the story is like watching porn for the plot.
---
I'd just like to point out: the fact that the top few hundred comments in this thread are all some variety of "screw ANet, this sucks, their apology isn't good enough," is **exactly why** game companies never admit fault, never go back on decisions, and never seem to learn.
---
Fallout 76 literally scams its special edition customers, they decided to give a paltry $5 in store credit, they get reemed out. GW2 screws up a cheat detection program for a small number of players, gives ~$30 in credit plus all missed story unlocks (another ~$30), and they *still get reemed out*. 
---
What's the incentive for game companies to be good, own mistakes, and make up for them, if communities are going to be harsh anyway? It looks like ANet's best case scenario here (in terms of money and reputation) would have been to have said and done nothing. Is that really the message we want to send? Is that the behavior we want to encourage?
---
I never tried to argue that I wasn't being a dick, I tried to argue that the griffon isn't a grind (it's not). Seems like you are the one moving the goal posts 
---
&gt; If I responded with half that level of incompetence at work I’d probably be very fired.
---
Why are you assuming that no one got fired or severely reprimanded for this in one way or another? 
---
Dang, really wish I learned about Dinky last week. I just created my first Charr and chose the Eng as my buddy, and I can’t reroll him cause I already boosted him :/
---
There's an increasing gap between 4fun groups and groups interested in "speedclears". And by "speedclears" I mean anything that's remotely organised / effective. 
---
The only way to avoid 4fun players is by excluding the vast majority of the playerbase through KP / requirements / toxicity. It's sad but it's the only way to make organised groups at this point in the game. Anything else turns in the clownfiesta you've witnessed. 
---
Try to find a few friends you can do them with. Even 2-3 players can carry a lot harder than just solo. You can also make and control your own groups. In EU, if you make T4 groups just add a bunch of requirements to scare away the wrong kind of crowd. Buzzwords like asking for meta roles, demanding food / pots, exp, ... will scare off a reasonable amount of 4fun players. 
---
Alternatively, skip fractals all together and just get into raiding. It's not that difficult and training raids can be found through discord with trainers and everything on both EU and NA. You don't need full ascended to get into this either. And plenty of raid groups / guilds are among the experienced fractal players. 
---
I got bank tons of tabs when they added tonics to the novelty panel, and they added 2 more tabs to the max.
---
So now I'm filling them with mithril ore, silk scraps and exotic essences of luck. 
---
When it comes to the mithril and ore, I'll be able to give them some use next Festival of the Four winds, but for luck there could be more sinks. 
---
He looks lovely. 
---
*DeviantArt wants to know your location.*
---
Honestly if a group is requiring all female charr engis and you try and join the group on something else, you're the asshole here.
---
I personally never put LI requirements on my groups, but like it or not you should respect the group reqs. Faking LI just makes you the tool.
---
I really enjoy theese threads when you guys pretend to know what eachother are talking about with your online basic courses
---
I'm in the US and I beg you to do this. GDPR is something that needs to be upheld and if this means better accountability across all fronts. I've spent over $1,000 USD on this game and I want them to improve. 
---
This is exactly what I'm trying to say but op is so fixated on the fact that I'm being a 'big meanie' instead
---
I swear man I am so sick of this carebear community

---
&gt; I have never played an engineer before and I plan to use the level 80 boost on it. Is it recommend?
---
If you're experienced at the game, sure. If not, I usually recommend *attempting* to level to 40, and see how you do. If you get a good handle of the class beforehand, use the boost; if not, then keep leveling until you do. I wouldn't boost and head straight into HoT or anything with it, but boosting and giving yourself time to get acclimated shouldn't be an issue.
---
&gt; If not what kinda build should I do before I unlock holosmith?
---
Holosmith is really just an extension of the old Engi power builds. IIRC, it used to be explosives/firearms/tools, and holosmith just replaces tools. If you were leveling and you felt squishy, you could replace tools with a more defensive trait-line if you so choose until you get used to Engi.
---
&gt; And bonus question: what's the best looking race for holosmith?
---
I run Asura, but it's pretty subjective; it's pretty much going to come down to your personal tastes. Medium armor Charr can be lackluster, so perhaps not that unless you really want to go for the Iron Legion Charr aspect of Charr culture. Otherwise, I think the other races are pretty even in terms of fashion-wars.
---
I can provide the ticket number, but it was sent in French, that's probably part of why you couldn't find it. Do you want it nonetheless? I can also make a rough translation for you in PM, if that's easier for you. :)
---
Thank you for your interest!
---
Well, I don't assume new player means new to internet/Reddit, that's another story.
---
Oui, s'il vous plait. My French may be pretty basic when it comes to trying to write it myself, but I can read it just fine. :3
---
I’ve run into this big a couple of times recently. I’d already seen posts on here about it so I wasn’t to concerned. It is distracting though so I hope they get it patched soon.
---
The current system isn’t working either though considering innocent people were basically screwed for a year until Anet realized the mistake and threw an apology letter at them.
---
Zeebebrurubt!
---
Wild ZUBAT appeared!
---
Du du du duuu du du du~
---
yes, viper gears in ascended rarity are difficult to be acquired for newbies who want to try some condition play, while carrion things are easier.
---
by the way, the links are actually what I've been looking for! thank you!
---
Warrior's reflects if traited, has a shorter cooldown, has a stun+mini gap close.
---
Warrior's is better for pvp and is also useless for pve.
---
I would argue rev's should give more boons, since that is what Herald is all about. It also wouldn't hurt for it to have some form of offensive utility, where that is a cc or some damage. My ideal would be a damage aoe at the end of the block with increased damage and maybe a short immobilize or chill if you blocked an attack. Double cast to do the damage portion early since you can't very well follow people as they walk out of range.
---
&gt; farm money
---
... but do it in real life: much more efficient.
---
You might have some things in your bank and material storage that you can sell for gold to help you afford the missing episodes. Mystic coins especially, you might have a pile lying in your bank.
---
Got it with a new norn last night  
---
Absolutely do not go back to  T3. If you’re worried about people not knowing mechanics in T4 then you don’t realize the cancer that is t3.
---
Try to play with people with good comps or with a guild. Go for “T4 Dalies Food/pots” groups at reset with at least a druid. You’ll see and learn from people that make T4s seem like a joke and before you know it you finish in 30mins
---
If you got the time (and energy), please do. The GDPR is an important piece of consumer right, and it makes sense to at least raise concerns over companies mishandling it with the relevant authorities.
---
Are you saying we never left glints trial
---
I recently went back and gave revenant another try and I’m loving it.

Hmm, I think we're both wrong and it's 43 minutes.

I actually thought that maybe they would use something like elasticsearch that is used to filter the data in logs :p

I want an ascended Berzerker rifle for my holosmith. Is the Cursed Flintlock really just [about 7g like gw2efficiency says](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-82813)? Also is it very easy or relatively quick to get? I haven't done any of the specialization weapons from PoF yet, just Dark Harvest which is super sweet and was totally worth it. Thanks! :D
---
omg where do i get those cat ears
---
If you have time, use the [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Prototype_Position_Rewinder). It makes this heart going #2 among worst hearts ever.
---
Imo [THAT one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help_Charradis_Estate_Ranchers_attend_to_cattle) is #1.
---
&gt; I don't like "lazy screenshots", but I don't care about the quality of the screenshots themselves.
---
The point is that you've accepted that there should be some stuff that there is rules about beyond upvotes/downvotes and so just saying "upvotes/downvotes will take care of it" doesn't really work. You're applying your own arbitrary preferences - which is fine, that's what pretty much all of us are doing, it just invalidates the appeal to upvote/downvote as an argument.
---
&gt; As long as we have flairs so everyone can filter out the trash, who cares?
---
That's true only as long as flairs delineate between what I or someone else might consider good content versus bad. If we like *some* stuff within a flair but there's a deluge of bad content within that same flair then it's not much help.
---
&gt; If you want to look for upvote/downvote problems, address the elephant in the room, which is the constant downvoting of interesting threads.
---
I honestly don't know if this is happening or how much, because I guess if it happens, it would be in the 'new' section which I, like most peoplem don't frequent. You can certainly argue that's a bad thing, and maybe even that I'm not a hypocrite for "doing my part" in new, but it is also the way most people browse.
---
Now if it is a problem, I'm certainly open to solutions for it. Off the top of my head, you could have downvotes disabled for threads in the subreddit (not a huge fan of this personally but it's an option). It might also be possible to prevent downvotes for the first x hours of a threads life, I'm not sure.
---
However, these sorts of moves do not address the problem I described, because what I am talking about is not interesting threads being downvoted, but rather not getting upvoted as much as other stuff due to not receiving as much traffic since the content is not as easily and quickly digestible as a meme or screenshot.
---
I'm pretty sure new animations would be too troublesome in many ways.
---
Tons of skills/utilities and traits in game across multiple classes that need either reworks or tweaks.
---
In herald shield's case I'd say the following tweaks would be fine
---
1: Up the duration of the protection on the number 4 slightly.
---
5: Increase the size of the barrier &amp; make it stop projectiles so that allies can more easily get inside it.
---
I think it will bring the ability to freely choose stats
---
(what tributes...? o.o) ive been here 6 years I swear lol i dont remember
---
Same. All it does is waste an enormous amount of pretty artworks, voice work, models etc on underdeveloped forgettable zones, while ensuring the story can never feel like one big coherent thing because of the forced content-swapping.
---
And of course it means that all the other zones of the game go woefully underdeveloped because ain't nobody got time for dat shit! :(
---
I'll just wait in here until someone asks about the piece of the set
---
Big, if true.
---
I think the main challenge, above all else right now, is that it will require some kind of reworking of story. I doubt they want to introduce a new race and involve them in the old personal story, but so much of the story centers the commander of the Pact. 
---
I would expect that the story would just be told in a different way. Where the pact commander is kind of a character you join in with and tag along. 
---
Anyone who was banned and is now coming back, apparently, are ok with that.
---
because with a legendary armor you can automatically do all positions, be 100% top dps and never fail.  
---
what a shitshow of an argument..
---
The commander fucked up and didnt want to retread on his mistake. jeah shitty character but your argument makes no sense
---
&gt; tribute 
---
These are items used to craft the generation 2 legendary weapons. You use them to craft the precursors and the gift of X items.

That was what was interesting regarding your post with the GDPR stuff. Technically they are in violation, and it sounds like they are unprepared for GDPR at all. As someone who manages compliance for a company, our customers would flip out on us if we came back with that type of response, along with a statement from EU officials. Companies are supposed to give you back your data (in whichever format you prefer). Requesting additional information from you to "verify" is no excuse. Makes me think they haven't prepared for GDPR at all other than at the front end (e.g. privacy policy, saying but not actually doing).
---
I think the key is investigating the issues themselves rather than the complaints/appeals.  the real problem is with their internal QA process, not with customer service.
---
the devs can check and review code without it being tied to a customer support ticket.
---
Yeah, if you want to play a single player game, there's tons of alternatives out there, which are far superior to what we got here.
---
Those are really good episodes and are a big part of the story. I'd recommend trying to get them as well. However if you don't want to or can't, watch them on youtube!
---
Sold all my bank for episodes i bought before) But thx for advice
---
My guess is the fractal invisible fix caused this.
---
Something unique like dyeable glow would be cool but I'm doubtful; likely just another infusion-type glow/color effect, likely ley-line-themed, judging from the name.
---
Yeah, my salary in next month.
---
If i couldnt farm enough ingame will donate.
---
Really want to complete all story.
---
Thx for advice.
---
You can get it from fractal, wvw, raids, achievements. Raids are the easiest to get from. If you do only the easy bosses you probably can get in 1 or 2 weeks
---
gotta keep an eye out for them :3
---
dudu awww
---
I just want 3 things for Heral shield:
---
* Envoy of Exuberance
---
 * Increase the duration of existing protection on allies by +1s for each affected ally other than yourself, up to 6s. This would be applied after the skill applies its own protection.
---
* Crystal Hibernation: 
---
 * Make it work a bit more like Infuse Light, but with barrier instead healing. Instead blocking attacks while channeling and healing each pulse, it would give stability once, then turn incoming damage into barrier per pulse.
---
 * Same 3s duration/channeling.
---
 * Still roots in place.
---
 * Recharge increased to 30s.
---
 * Pulses 3 times instead 4.
---
 * Gives 3 stacks of stability for 4s on the first pulse.
---
 * Gives 1s of a Crystal Hybernation effect per pulse. The Crystal Hybernation effect converts all incoming damage to barrier. Barrier gained from this effect would still be affected by the usual limitations of barrier: 5s duration and capped at 50% of max HP.
---
* Hardening Persistence
---
 * Replace the damage reduction effect per upkeep with an effect that gives gives barrier when healing allies, equal to 15% of the healing done. The barrier depends on the amount of healing done, not the healing the skill can do, so using a skill that gives 2000 healing to an ally missing only 1000 HP would only give 150 barrier, not 300. 
---
 * In addition to its other effects now it also replaces Crystal Hibernation with Crystal Stasis
---
 * Crystal Stasis works like Crystal Hibernation with a few differences:
---
       * Recharge reduced to 25s.
---
       * Increase stacks of stability to 5. 
---
       * Makes the herald immune to boon removal and boon corruption while it's channeling. 
---
gen 2 legend hammer shakur
---
&gt; 'tribute to arah
---
It was added for one of the more recent ones, the hammer [Sharus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sharur)
---
O M F G  i will definitely test this. 
---
If it works as you say. Dude you will be officially my hero.
---
Do ranked PVP, you can get 3 marks with the rewards and exchange for a weapons of your choice.  
---
&gt;So one of the most important things for you is a thing that most MMORPGs in general are quite bad at? 
---
Different people play for different reasons. I also play primarily for the story, but that isn't to say I don't care about gameplay, community, graphics etc.
---
That said, I haven't been too disappointed with the triple A story offerings. FFXIV, WoW and GW2 all have decent stories. Well.. WoW is debatable. It has a lot of really bad parts, and requires engagement in out-of-game content like books to really get it, but I digress. GW2's also was pretty bad for the personal story, but got a lot better once the living world began imo.
---
I play T4 every day; i have a healbrand and a staff dd. I'm in a T4/raid guild (it's the best guild Ive ever been i love it), but i used to Pug every day.
---
It's not uncommon for me to run t4s 2 or sometimes 3 per day. I still pug 1-2 times per week.
---
I have no issues pugging. Sure, clears are not as fast as with a (near) meta group in discord, but who cares? I run all 3 t4 in 30 min average... Maybe 45 if i had trouble.
---
Pugs are fine. Check www.metababatle.com for good fractal builds for your class. Each day at reset check YouTube guides for the daily fractals. That will teach you all the mechanics.
---
When you pug you want 1 healer (ren, druid, healbrand, tempest, necro, whatever) , 1 boon support (Chrono, renegade, heal or quickbrand, etc) and 3 dps. Feel free to replace a dps for a dps support (like banner warr or quickbrand).
---
As long as you have 1-2 people that can heal and 2-3 people that give boons you are more than fine. Anyone that says otherwise doesnt actually know how to do t4s.
---
Rev is strange anyway and in my view needs a rework overall better sooner than later. 
---
Rev was desinged with an elite spec at any time and does not work in the slightest without atleast in my opinion. Support rev would lack a second legend to support and besides staff would have no options as second weapon set either. Even with herald shield is bad enough since you lack a propper main hand or some kind of ranged support. Condi rev has the same problems no second legend to chose from no second weapon set. If you go renegade you endup with shortbow a super poor weapon and kala a super poor legend for competitiv play, really poorly done and you can't fix it by taking something else since there is nothing. Power rev is probabbly the closest to work as core but still miles away from being useful.
---
That you are forced to take 2 kits of 5 fixed skills never made sense to me either. Everytime you end up with  skills being utterly useless or lacking key things. 
---
Example: You take ventari for pvp, ups no stunbreak so basically you tell the enemy if you stun me now I'm helpless. You use shiro and are for 10s unable to cleanse any damaging conditions (-staff). The list goes on and on. 
---
What they needed to do in the first place was to atleast give you a few options to choose from. Rev is so limited in many ways 
---
Ah yes, the flying rats from hell. I concur.
---
Yeah its very easy...only part that  MAY be tricky is with those skritt that run away.
---
Two questions:  
---
1. How do I tell it's working? I followed the steps on README, but saw no improvement in FPS.
---
2. Can this work with GW2Hook?
---
3. If not, will you be working on making it work with GW2Hook?
---
This is good to know as I am also returning from an extended hiatus and was not looking forward to trying to LFG this mission.. I had beaten it before but never and the one to start the instance so I guess I never got credit...
---
No, because if you have the ability to grind for legendary armor, it means you've likely dipped your toes into raids more than once, and it's an even clearer indicator of your ability to raid than 'LI count' is because you can *actually show* legendary raid armor (raid armor, not WvW or PvP in case you thought I was that dumb). Just ask them to transmute the pieces. Plus, OP had a legendary set and a precursor, PLUS insights, which means he had 40 **over the limit**. 
---
Your snide remark about 100% top dps and doing all positions is even more a shitshow than anything I have said. If you're not going to discuss in good faith, fuck off.
---
Ohhhh.. totally forgot that thing existed (i dont like it), makes sense now, thanks!!
---
Rampager's is terrible, never use it.
---
So you just what, woke up today and said FUCK I AM -SO- MAD ON BEHALF OF THOSE PEOPLE I HADN'T HEARD OF IN MONTHS IF AT ALL and decided to come to Reddit to personally address Anet on their cheapness, for something you have no involvement in, because the arbitrary amount they gave is not as high as the arbitrary amount you've decided on? 
---
Beautiful
---
It is impossible for all weapons (and to that extent, all utility skills and trait lines as well) to be useful in all game modes because all game modes arent equal and dont offer the same objectives and roles for players to fill in.
---
Open pve can run anything but most optimally one should get good at avoiding dmg via dodges and go for full glass cannon bursting. In this case anything defense or utility related is not useful and will never be useful no matter what you add to it because defensive abilities do not contribute for burst dmg (otherwise they arent defensive abilities)
---
In dungeons which are pretty easy now days with all the power creep ,everyone goes for full burst speed clears, so anything that doesnt contribute for top dps is not useful.   
---
Raids on the other hand have specific roles to be fulfilled and do use skills that you dont usually see in other places ,including a shield wielding heralds.
---
In wvw where blobs crash into blobs, melee in general, single target attacks and much more isnt useful at all and will never be useful because the objective of the game mode punishes you for using it as you try to play it the wrong way.
---
In Spvp it all depends on the meta which had many changes trough out the years for various reasons, be it class balance, introduction to hot elite specs, to newest pof elite specs, or several reworks they did across some elite professions over the past year or so. 
---
If we are really going to make all weapons ,utility skils and trait lines across all professions and elite specs useful in all game modes then where is the limit? When do we stop adding more and more things on "less seen" skills across all game modes?
---
How many things should they add to warriors warhorn so people will start using it in equal amounts as they would use shields?
---
How many things should they add to necro focus so it can be used in wvw ?
---
Should they also change all 3 game modes to have a very similar goal and game play? 
---
Do we remove all flavor , theme and utility from all skills in the game and make them a reskin of the same thing in order to make all professions be able to fill the same role in all game modes using any skill they wish?
---
Do you understand now how okay it is that some weapons and skills arent useful in all game modes is?
---
And how instead to look how useful in all 3 game modes a profession in its entirety is a better and more realistic goal for any game developer?
---
If you have a thief with deadeye fully unlocked then it can be completed in a few hours if you have a guide. You'll need to complete 1 map on the thief and complete a few specific PoF group events. If you put up LFG posts or ask in map chat you can get a group together without too much trouble.
---
It just blows my mind why the "we want to do it a very specific way" form pugs at all. I've never seen other mmo raiding communities not form raiding guilds for the advanced experienced raiders only stuff. Pugs from my experience are notoriously bad because you'll have random people either not pull their weight or flame everyone for not doing anything a specific way. And it takes a while before you can even do anything because of this.
---
I still remember and hate the whole "Oh, I must commune with the spirits and do all this stuff to being able to get inside the volcano an- oh, hi Taimi.. did you, like, just jump in on that golem? Yup"
---
True, but run into enough assholes and it dampens your enthusiasm. 
---
This is an odd question to ask as you’ve provided no information on why you stopped playing. 
---
Other games...but I still love gw2. 
---
Legendary Divinations*
---
Gw2 is probably one of the best games to get back into, since there is no actual grind, you dont need to have legendaries all over the place to be good, full exotics works perfectly fine.
---
Content is easy to get by, just give it time.
---
The what now? Oh the ring we started collecting in *fucking 2017*. Honestly, I don't give a fuck about that anymore.
---
See that's some good feedback. I was always under the impression that if I didn't have a legendary I wasn't making it.? 
---
Kill it with fire
---
Isn't this a prerogative of every legendary something? 
---
Anet tend to have Forum Chats after every Living Story release where they'll answer questions like "What is your favourite quaggan? XD" and respond to statements like "This was the best episode ever. I burst into tears and cried onto my dog when the player character was breezing through the gameplay with no problem and then lost the fight via cutscene interjection."
---
You won't get much else beyond that out of the Forum Chats though.
---
I never done raid but want to try it but was stuck as you with some "unfreindly" people who kick you out as you and not good enough. So did put it away because of that for long time. 
---
Shadu
---
What was that 2nd composition.
---
Mesmer Dps, Druid, Rev, Scourge.
---
Did you had 3 heal + Tetraplegic with you?
---
Remember when silk was overpriced?
---
Some people were unbanned after a month (they still missed the whole Super Adventure Festival though). I know a few of them, but they were all veterans, who are also frequent gem purcharsers. Guess that made them easier for them to be unbanned, considering everyone else was considered a false flag now.
---
Should have unbanned everyone if they had any suspicion it could go this wrong. The damage has already been done, and I sincerely doubt many of those players will come back anyway.
---
I appreciate them admitting the mistake, but as long as the banning policy remains the same, nothing has changed. MMOs are specially delicate with this kind of things, players invest a lot of their time (and sometimes money), and the mere thought of losing everything for some dumb reason is incredibly disheartening.
---
I hope many of the fanboy idiots, who love to bring out the pitchforks every time someone comes in here after being wrongfully banned, take those same pitchforks and shove them up their own asses before engaging in yet another witch hunt against someone who is just looking for help.
---
there's a new Scrapper icon?
---
easy there gandhi, not everyone has the patience to wait for the fight animations to finish again and again and again an...
---
Scrappers used to have a whirlwind icon that looked a lot like the Tempest one, but it got changed after release.
---
Looks great!!! What back piece is that?
---
I'll explain you in more detail.
---
Thing is, when you try to raid, many groups ask you to show Legendary Insight, a currency you get when defeating Raid Bosses and Events. If you don't have enough then they usually kick you from a group.
---
Legendary Insight is also used to craft Legendary Armor, which needs tons of them. The person in question spent many LI crafting the armor, but the raid commander still asked him for 250 LIs. They are there, in armor form, commander just doesn't aknowledge them.
---
It shows the current problem we have with GW2 raiding community; the entry barrier is usually dependand in you being able to join training pug groups or training discord channels at certain schedules to farm your initial LI and learn the mechanics. Thing is, LIs are a self-imposed community entry barrier which is more common than you would believe, and this, being the most casual MMO in the market, doesn't really has in game tools to let you raid easier without the need of training groups or Discord, like Story Mode Raids or Auto-LFG (Things that FFXIV, WoW and ESO have, and they are morde "hardcore" RPGs).
---
Thus, the name of the topic is "This is the peak of the raiding community". Many people fail to aknowledge we're in need of a healthier ambiance in the raiding experience and that training runs are the solution to all this, but as someone who pugged many times with training guilds, I can assure you it's not. Raids can be completed with any class, but the community is centered arround trying to imitate pro raiders, thus stuff like Reaper, Scourge and others are often regarded as "useless" when it comes to this game mode.
---
We didnt have that with aurora i dont see why we would get it with the ring
---
&gt; I think the best way is to just leave the anti-cheat in the game.
---
The actual program they used should never be used again. It's pretty much spyware, and might even get them in legal trouble.
---
Gear that you can purchase with Memories are WAAAAA........AAAAY overpriced.
---
GW2's story post-core has been steadily improving on average with some rough patches sprinkled in.  The last handful of episodes (minus kourna) have been some of the teams' best overall work both map wise and personal story wise.  
---
I think my main issue is that GW2 as a whole is more story focused and less world construction focused.  GW2 since the beginning glosses over a lot of world lore and relies on players being familiar with GW1 to understand the significance of certain elements of the story and the world.  The story gets you to play, the world compels you to stay.
---
oh yeah, now I remember... faintly...
---
&gt; to ffxiv as my main MMO
---
I get that joke :D That's hilarious!
---
I have 15 characters.
---
All have all Eite Specs.
---
????
---
Profit!
---
Noone likes Kormir really, but I like your art, nice mate.
---
No
---
Then you should have no problems restarting again. I often take long breaks from GW2 but it always feels good when I come back to it. 
---
It was a pleasure and an honor, and I am happy that this post helped more than my SO and myself. :)
---
I'm assuming you already played through the personal story and already know that part of it. If not, just finish that first. I wouldn't put too much emphasis on doing the story mode of dungeons, unless you really want to try and find a group for them. Just read up on [Destiny's Edge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Destiny%27s_Edge), UNTIL you reach the "Dissolution" section and stop, as that gets into further spoilers in the story. After that the story goes as follows: 
---
1. **Living World season 1:** This is no longer available due to being implemented as live updates that get overwritten/disappear, but you can find a long video on everything that happened here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg. This is a fairly long video if you really want to get into it. As many people can tell you (without spoiling much) a lot of this story was done in a haphazard manner and ended up being, for the most part, inconsequential. The important take-aways from this season are some of the characters you meet, the faction known as the "Zephyrites", and basically the ending. Luckily all of this will come together and make sense in the following season quite quickly. 
---
2. **Living World Season 2:** A vast improvement to the season 1 format as far as story-telling goes, and also available for purchase. A lot of stuff that happens here is still relevant to the story going on right now, so I would not completely skip over it. Once again, there are video resources on this, such as this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyhA2D_s24Q&amp;list=PLdxmChRD2epeVktDmcO0KTsHrcc2essxq 
---
4. **Heart of Thorns:** I'm assuming that since you could buy and play One Path Ends, you do have the HoT expansion. Play this after you brushed up on Season 2.
---
5. **Season 3:** You have the very last episode of this season, but if you don't want to wait to learn about the others, there is once again a playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1xUJIUBmL4&amp;list=PLdxmChRD2epfXgdrx8lh_vDdveZAcg8XG 
---
6. **Path of Fire:** I'm also assuming you have this since you bought the episodes. Play it after season 3.
---
7. **Season 4:** You have the first two episodes of this. Just play through those. I'd honestly suggest just buying the next ones early. They're some of the best story content, along with mostly really good gameplay content (with maybe one episode that was meh). 
---
What do you think the point of reddit is? It's a discussion board and I am stating my displeasure with ANET being cheap. 
---
The reason I said another 2500 gems is because it would routhly equal the amount of gold they lost from dailys and login rewards. 
---
Hi, I'm a bot (in Beta). I combined your list of YouTube videos into one shareable highlight reel link:  https://app.hivevideo.io/view/f8e0a8
---
 You can play through the whole highlight reel (with timestamps if they were in the links), or select each video.
---
 Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.
---
(1) it's not like that's unique to the area. (2) if you know the route, you'll come across ~7 or so random fights, so you don't need much patience.
---
I dont know man...
---
10 silver is simply not enough gold to make it worth for me.
---
But i only need gold very rarely these days, so hoarding it is.
---
I agree and at the same time i disagree
---
You're totaly right that ppl wanna rush w1-4 so they have time for w5+6. This People can be quite troublesome to deal with as you allready mentioned. On the other Hand this People will be done with W1-4 usually at the End of Wednesday. So after Wednesday the People are mostly more Chill or have allready cleared all Wings and are only there to have fun.
---
ahahahahaha xD meanies! I quite like her :P 
---
Thank you :)
---
"punish" is a pretty strong word for not getting extra things for free
---
Not all heroes wear capes. You did something remarkable friend. 
---
Now, 2,500 gems should be enough to buy your friend's episodes. I think it is fine.
---
Taking fashion wars to the next level.
---
Do tequatl everyday 
---
Yes
---
That's amazing, this brings back so many memories.
---
If you want an organized group then you have to make a sizable contribution to it with a support class.  
---
That's originally how I broke into Fractal CMs.  I learned Chaos Chrono and then flexed DPS and Druid until I was comfortable with them.  Hybrid DPS classes like Renegade or Firebrand are also fairly useful.  I lean towards Firebrand with either power or condition damage because in less organized  groups you're going to have a little more time to ramp up and cFirebrand is *almost* a power class anyhow; it's pretty bursty! 
---
T4 is very much about respecting the instabilities.  It's important that you have some form of boon-corrupt or boon-strip when you're facing no-pain-no-gain.  Fractals emphasize burst power DPS on the upper-end, and losing ~ **1/3rd** of your damage hurts.  It's why I'm fine with getting Reapers or Scourges; GS4 (Nightfall), Axe 3 (Unholy Feast), Scepter 3 (Devouring Darkness) and corrupt boon (on either build) are good substitutes for the absence of a Spellbreaker.  Chrono can also take shattered concentration these days. 
---
The best time is definitely to pug around reset.  There tend to be plenty of people looking for regular T4's.  The groups just fill up really quick so it's often like they weren't even there.  You can safely bet that "core" support builds are what attract stronger players.  If you want to get carried it'd be best to learn something like [Chrono, Druid, Firebrand or Renegade.](https://discretize.eu/builds) and advertise for your missing half alongside DPS fills.  Think about how to adapt to the various daily Fractals as well. 
---
T4 Fractals aren't so difficult that people can't play whatever.  It's more about playing stuff well than playing pure meta.  The meta matters a little more for CMs, but that's slightly off-topic.  Suffice to say that cleaner phases = easier CMs and an easier time reading boss mechanics.  Much of T4 is really just adapting to the content, making little optimizations if needed, communicating and doing what you can to make the runs more smooth for your team.  pDPS overtakes cDPS when you're doing Fractals with lots of phases and you actually start to play with burstier players that have mastered their rotations, but until that point? Just have fun. 
---
the ones he listed are the ones he's missing
---
The only thing you might've missed is unlocking an episode of living story for free while it was active, but even that can be purchased on the gem store. Having a legendary or ten or none at all are arbitrary and individual goals, and none of it puts you behind.
---
Think about legendaries as the last thing to have, Ascended gear has the same stats, legendary bring one of the best quality of life, since you can swap stats which makes it easier to go around the meta (if you are interested in it) and also has a cool skin, but that's pretty much it, you wont have better stats than someone with ascended and has barely 6-8% better stats than exotic.
---
So dont worry about it, the understanding of your class and content is more valuable than being fully geared with Legendaries
---
I guess it will spawn some [**clouds**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescence_(physics)) above you...
---
Ok awesome will do. I will be patching the game tonight and jumping back in. Still populated ? 
---
If you are starting with regular t4, make sure you have boon support and some form of healing. Also, when instabilities provide boons to enemies, it is crucial to have some reliable way of stripping them - chrono, spellbreaker, scourge all work fine.
---
Boon support means you want might, quickness, fury, alacrity, regeneration and possibly protection, the last two of this list provide a smoother experience in tight situations.
---
Classes that typically give boon support are Chrono (quick, alac), Druid (might, fury and any other boon except for resistance), Firebrand (any boon except for alacrity), Renegade (might, alacrity, protection; more when coming on Herald), Tempest (anything but quick, alacrity, resistance), Scourge (mainly might, regen afaik) and Warrior (might, fury if speccing for it - a bit out of flavour asa  boon bot but possible).
---
Healing can come from many classes, notably: Druid (additional offensive support), tempest, scourge (very defensive, extremely safe), scrapper (kinda niche), firebrand (pretty good and versatile) and then some more like minstrel chrono but that's another story.
---
As you can see, the two sections overlap heavily and as long as you can cover both areas in your group, you are likely to succeed no matter what. Personally, I've found that providing support is an easy way to carry groups then by doing sweet juicy dps which I'm kinda mediocre with anyways.
---
Finally, since the introduction of CMs, the gap between groups that run them and those that don't has been widening substantially, both in terms of skill and in terms of tactics applied when clearing content (skipping, positioning etc.). 
---
As far as I remember you can't gift Episodes. 
---
I have been switching spvp main every season and get good points that way but really... Do your dailies! It's quick and easy ap. I usually get dailies done in spvp, and do my wvw dailies and a few infusion bosses. If I remember correctly just doing Hot story + ls has given me a bunch lately. 
---
Gonna be doing that tonight then! 
---
I personally hate all hearts. Not a fan of questing, hehe. 
---
BUT! There is one exception: some hearts without the event taking ages to complete.
---
For example: Kill the centaurs, but ALL of them are outside of the heart area lol, so u gotta do some other shit, which is taking veery long time to complete. 
---
Toggle button, to disable annoying effect on the aurora. 
---
&gt;Is it possible to understand story without this parts?
---
Of course. Just read a plot synopsis for the episodes you miss. The fact that season 1 isn't even available in game, wherein many characters were introduced, is already an unavoidable gap in the story.
---
It's worse that you're missing out on the new maps, achievements, rewards, etc. that also come with each release. Some have been better or worse than others, but I don't think there's been one yet that wasn't worth having.
---
Yeah, events are pretty much filled.
---
Thank you.
---
Bruh, first of all, like I said, drop that shitty smartass attitude, if you actually played the games I named, you should know what Im talking about. 
---
You again only talk about the ones that work, not the ones that dont work, you bring the open world pvp from Aion, but not the Arenas that also had a lot of afks and trolls. League of legends aswell, even if it's a MOBA, you have trolls and afks.
---
 If you knew BnS, you should know the presence of bots and afk you would get in 3v3 arenas.
---
But okay mate, keep going with that dumbass attitude.
---
I did mentioned that Gw2 isnt the only one, yet you deny it, which is already going against the biggest fact, that Gw2 IS CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY GAME THAT HAS THOSE ISSUES. 
---
But you will be able to give me another retarded answer like "Yeah but this game or that one work perfectly fine" forgetting there are way more games out there that have the same issue. Shithead
---
Clearly was too busy looking at horse girl anime to do a proper job, hence all this fiasco. During the pre ban wave all the slobbered on his twitter feed was anime horse girls and brag rights on "banning" hackers, I wonder how legit they where after this whole fiasco. Let's hope he can go to his farm an enjoy his horsegirls
---
Oh, that sucks then.
---
You are all out of your fucking minds... and the main thread is even more bullshit. 
---
Overall I like it, but it really does vary a lot throughout the game. Sometimes the character writing is good, other times it's nearly insufferable. On a macro-level the plot feels alright, sometimes really good, but in the finer details it often feels inconsistent, likely due to how often it's just different people writing and implementing everything. Remember this game has been out for over 6 years now, plenty of time for people at the company to come and go, along with other team shake-ups. A story that has to keep evolving for that long is hard to maintain an exceptional quality and consistency in, with so many people involved in creating it.
---
But, yeah my philosophy with MMO stories is basically, if it impresses me, great! If not, whatever, I have loot to get, so let's wrap this up.
---
Chrono is useful everywhere and the power rotation is relatively easy. There's a lot of utility and CC available as well.
---
&gt; Name one.
---
&gt; Seriously. Name one prophecy that became true without people actively working to make sure it gets fulfilled. Even the Flameseeker Prophecies, which Glint manipulated into occurring by selectively leaving pieces out, did not fully come to pass.
---
People have to do something to fulfill prophecies, oh what a wonder. That's nothing new...
---
However, the player wasn't the only choosen, who could fulfill the flameseeker prophecies. There were hundreds if not thousands of potential choosen (most of them were killed by the white mantle).
---
Another example is the great dwarf / the rubicon tome. That was a prophecy of the end of the dwarfs and the fight against the great destroyer. 
---
&gt;The vision Aurene gave us while an egg of Mordremoth creating clones of Logan, Zojja, Trahearne? Didn't occur. Mordremoth only managed to clone one of the three.
---
&gt;The vision Aurene gave us of Lonai going through a portal into Tyria while leading an army of Awakened? Didn't occur. We stopped the Awakened army before Lonai passed through, she went through without an army.
---
&gt;The vision of Aurene dying in the desert, a green hill, or a mountainside didn't occur. She died in a cave.
---
&gt;The Pale Tree's vision of us freeing King Reza at the royal tombs in Cursed Shore? Didn't happen, we freed his soul in the Artesian Waters.
---
Don't mix up prophecies with visions, there are significant differences...
---
&gt;  for the wikia
---
Tbh, that's the reason you shouldn't receive any help here. 
---
I’m sorry, they didn’t cover cat people in college 
---
Unfortunately for you, despite your negative bullshit you're posting here, I did receive help.
---
This really makes me wish ANet would overhaul the LFG system.
---
I think this would work far better if you had better options and filters, i.e. to advertise the group is "casual level" and allow skilled players to filter them out.
---
I don't raid for this reason; not because of elitists, but just because I never got into it when it was new, I fell behind the curve, and I feel that by trying, I'm going to be hampering other people's enjoyment. If I could specify in the LFG "first timer" or something as a filterable option then I would be less hesitant.
---
Fractals get around this by having the levels, where the lower ones are quite easy. I know that isn't reallty compatible with how raiding works, though. I also know I could watch videos on YouTube and learn the encounters first, but if that's necessary, I don't really want to even try (I want to learn a game by playing it primarily).
---
Its a new age where we cant have nice things. If this had released without the leggins and shoulder stuff i'd be all over it.
---
Nowadays it's like"Bffy Ldr Drgn slyr".
---
It doesn't cost ANET anything you dope, 5000 gems for a 6 months suspension is hardly outrageous 
---
The ToS actually state that they can close an account for no reason at all. I'm also not looking for a legal fight, all I really wanted was to find the truth and possibly get it out there, which as of today I accomplished.
---
I had two geniuses who said "*potions are for cm only*". But yeah, there's this weird tendency of not having even the bare minimum of green defense potion.
---
Much entitlement. 
---
Zubat used supersonic 
---
I am confused 
---
I am dead f**k
---
Doesn't matter, they lost the ability to do so by being wrongfully banned and they deserve fair compensation. 
---
Ice actually.
---
*Continues to cast Chain Lightning*
---
Honestly, seeing this and all the shitstorm that lead to firing peter fries (and jessica price), I really lose more and more trust toward Arena Net. 
---
And it affects my will to play GW2. I still have it installed, but I can't really find motivation for it anymore. 
---
That's really sad, I spent many years playing only this game, it was a huge part of my life... I'm really disappointed with them.
---
you can turn off shoulders, gloves and hats on outfits.
---
This is what i do:
---
Core: fractals, world bosses
---
HoT: raids and meta events
---
PoF: bounties, metas (also raids but they are not for beginners)
---
Adventures. Get a shit ton of xp for getting gold. The griffon ones are my favorite way to level alts
---
Yeah asking a company to give a small amount of players more monopoly money is very entitled. 
---
No you can't, only hats
---
Reddit is too much drama, uncontrollable. 
---
Not all. Does this one let you?
---
To me it seems like S5 will come with the teased tutorial implementation and represent a sort of "new beginning" or a way for new Players to get into the Season themselves. Thus, the Story will probably gain distance from the Crystal desert and require a different Login screen. It's not that much work afterall. 
---
&gt;legendary deviations. 
---
Now I know what was the main prise or ERP tournament. 
---
I honestly have no idea. I think a lot of it is the difference between GW1 and GW2. I was huge into the speed clearing end of GW1 and at one point held several records. I know dungeons and fractals exist and used to be speed cleared but they never really scratched the same itch. Raids might but the friends that I have that still play don't so.... 
---
I haven't played in ~2 years though so things may have changed since. 
---
[No really, nobody likes her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6_4).  
---
Great piece btw :)
---
Disappointment.
---
Dang, the wiki is fast.
---
Thanks for the link! I can only check reddit at work :)
---
wait you can dye back items or is that the glider?
---
What is that Asura Female Abomination
---
The malevolent energy companion is hungry and actually just consumes all your other auras, it's the only way to hide Aurora
---
Doesn't work for me in firefox or chrome, not sure why. Using edge works as a workaround if anyone else has the same issue.
---
Dailys average more than 3g a day plus its called compensation for a reason
---
Well you bought it up originally as if the ToS magically resolves ANET of any responsibility and you seemed to falsely believe that the ToS let's a company do whatever they want, I was just correcting you. 
---
Why no tail?!?  Anet, we should be able to insert one, for RP purposes. 
---
We could really use separated "helm" skin from this outift. 
---
Please?
---
Saw this a while back in Cadacus'(or however it's spelled) Manor cutscenes. Only humans seemed affected though.
---
It's definitely got some of that aesthetic going, I thought the same thing.
---
Works fine for me in Firefox.
---
&gt;Also there's never any CM training
---
I don't camp lfg by any means, yet I still see CM groups withoot requirememnts every once and a while. Get there (or make your own), struggle for some first kills and accumulate some KPs to segregate yourself from "normal" trashclowns. Once you have 100-150 of those you are pretty much set to never see horrible people in fractals again, and as long as you can commit to ~45 (+/- 10) minutes runs, it is only going to get better. 
---
Lol the ears on mushroom head sylvari.
---
This is  some high quality armour (OC) we got here people. Not gonna lie man going through some stuff your post really helped me out today.
---
HOW YOU GOING TO TOP THIS POST? ANY HINTS FOR YOUR NEW ARMY OF FANS?
---
I'm using chrome and its working fine for me try reloading the page.
---
I have 2li from sh training runs and pof only so i can do w5/6 only. There is no place for people like me in raids because i have only one expansion. Btw the raids i paid for is also not accessible to me just because of communities li requirements.
---
Getting any ascended gear is difficult without ls3. There are only 2 raid wings with pof and pugs ask fot 150+ li atleast for them or 20+kp. Most of the training runs happen for w1-4. Very rarely someone puts up w5 training that too with obscene amount of li requirements. Also anet made sure to make these fights easy on condi builds and locked condi stats behind hot. Honestly theres no point in trying to raid unless i buy comm tag myself but that with getting multiple viable specs for select encounters geared up is approx 600+gold and i dont think i am braindead enough to farm that amount of gold. Everyday i regret buying pof instead of hot.
---
And no. No training guilds take someone who can only do w5/6 training as their initial training.
---
But they gave the account back so they got everything they spent their money on back. 
---
This community is fucking bonkers "He you banned my account, I spent 2k on your game, I want it all back!!!!". 
---
Get a fucking grip.
---
If I had my account banned I wouldn't be asking for all 4k back off them.
---
This is stupid why isnt this stuff in the game &lt;.&lt;
---
Looks pretty awesome on Charr. Really dig the hornless raised single set of ears look. It's makes them look like a different species of Charr. :)
---
Tell me your ingame name so I can join your group and leave midway through the boss figth. Jerk.
---
Just go and do t1 fractals. there is no gear requirement. Its just a mission to be completed. There is nothing much to it.
---
Time to buy some AsuRaid.
---
because the extra voiceacting would be to much effort and ingame mail is volatile and to short
---
Yep, those groups on the LFG are all that exist in your region (NA, EU, CN, etc) at the time. It should be noted that that's only the number of groups currently looking for people, and that many groups (typically of more experienced players) will never be on on the LFG to begin with.
---
&gt;out of a few million users
---
I'm not sure what this number is supposed to represent but the closest I can think of is the monthly active user count. The number of users at any one point in time in the game is much, much less than that.
---
Himalayan, with the proviso that its veracious.
---
Less complaining? It's 3 posts lol, It's okay to criticise ANET I know some of you get upset though. 
---
glider part of the combo
---
i got the same exact issue in the same exact spot on a completely fresh install of gw2, on a brand new computer. please tell me again how its not anets fault
---
So I've been playing almost two weeks now, and I really enjoy the PvP. I've gotten to PvP level 10, playing a mix of spellbreaker, firebrand, and thief. So far I enjoy thief the most for sure. However, I lose the vast majority of the games I play (My career score is 7 wins/13 losses right now) and I'm not stupid enough to blame a record like that on getting bad teams, but I also feel like I'm doing a decent job, getting in damage, rotating, and all the things that I saw in video guides for PvP.
---
I'm wondering if there's a mentor system in PvP similar to the mentor system in the open world, wherein people with special tags are available for help/questions/coaching, because I know I must be doing something wrong but I'm too inexperienced to know what it is yet, and I know from playing several fighting games that not figuring it out soon will just give me bad habits, which are so much harder to break than just learning it right the first time.
---
I really enjoy this. I don't expect it to be a regular thing for all releases (because not all of them leave a huge emotional cliff-hanger), but it's great that they're willing to put out something like this that doesn't have the limitations of being tied into some gameplay events.
---
It's also great that they really had something in mind about these 3 characters (Rytlock, Caithe, and Zafirah). I think they were the top 3 that people had a lot of questions about in terms of how they'll react to the events of the last episode. 
---
How come the image shows trails off the mount tail, but the video doesn't? Is it just video quality / the effect being lost in motion?
---
&gt; Dailys average more than 3g a day plus its called compensation for a reason
---
not without opportunity costs
---
&gt; Well you bought it up originally as if the ToS magically resolves ANET of any responsibility and you seemed to falsely believe that the ToS let's a company do whatever they want, I was just correcting you.
---
Anet doesnt have to give any compensation if they wouldnt want to except maybe refund their purchase price, if they ask for it.
---
And I didnt claim that Anet can do whatever they want, they just dont have to grant their customers unlimited service.
---
I really didn't expect *that* story to come up in a blog post.
---
This thread is incredible, people getting angry for the sake of being angry. 
---
They apologized and gave all of Season 4 so far for free and Gems (Maybe 4000 instead of 2500 but eh) and their accounts back, what are you expecting them to do? Give them a full refund of the game, Xpacs and Gem store purchases..AKA give them EVERYTHING for free? 
---
Also to those saying the system is "sloppy" obviously has absolutely no idea wtf they are talking about.."Oh there shouldn't be any mistakes"...welcome to the world of creating software and mix in a little bit of human error while you are at it, nothing is perfect, understand it and get over yourself, the fact that they kept looking at all the bans to the point they realized something went wrong should be testement that it wasn't a "ban and ignore" situation.
---
People are bitching in here with absolutely no idea what happened, whats going on and claims that what Anet did in response isn't enough and actually having no idea what they should have done, basically showing that it's anger for the sake of anger. 
---
Nothing will be good enough so quit saying "Oh this isn't good enouh". 
---
Dont let this distract you from the fact that necro ancer's  gm trait heals you for(130 base) less than regen every 1sec interval.
---
It is actually nothing, in a way. It costs them absolutely nothing to give it out; the only 'cost' to them is that it could mean the player they give it to will spend less money in the future because they already have some gems. Considering the low likelihood that these players will continue playing at all after this, and that they were originally prepared to ban them anyway and cut off the potential source of money, (and that it's only a "very small number of accounts"), it's hard to argue that it's a meaningful gesture. 
---
It could have be done without voice acting not everything in the game is voiced like say ESO is. It could have just been something where you became that character for a bit to read their thoughts.
---
I didn't know we needed this but I'm absolutely glad it's happening and i'm dying to know more
---
Poor Rytlock man, just......poor Rytlock
---
I think it will be in some form when episode 6 releases maybe an overview of the feelings of the group before we move onto the main story. I think this is to give players a more emm in depth account of Rytlocks feelings. Its interesting people were speculating that Rytlock would turn on us what I get from this is he would more likely turn away from the High Legions in the Black Citadel than he would turn away from us. We are his cubs.
---
Well, this artist surely tried to make a "sad Rytlock". Results are kinda hilarious.
---
https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/wallpapers/Requiem_Rytlock.jpg

Apparently Sohothin is enormous. No idea how mice were supposed to use it in the first place.
---
And here we have the classic example of "Upset on somebody elses behalf, now I will complain needlessly for change".
---
Seriously you people need to get a hobby, you shouldn't be "upset" because nothing happened to you, only those effected should be upset but instead they on this subreddit kicking up a storm.
---
Same here, something went wrong when embedding that thing into the gw2 site. What worked for me was to visit the twine directly:

Go to your bank in game. There is one tab that looks like a wardrobe (because it is)
---
You can preview any of the in game armor/weapons from there
---
And for dungeons specifically, to make the searching easier, you can preview them at the dungeon merchant in Lion's Arch (bottom of the map, near a bunch of portals)
---
I like it finally answered us how Rytlock got Sohothin and debunked that Rytlock will be mad at us and become Braham 2.0.
---
I initially thought the short bits of text with lots of clicking would be weird, kind of like the old in-game "books" that were just dialogue bubbles chained together, but I actually really liked it. They could do more with branching options, that one branch was less a real branch and instead just a few more pages added into the middle of the story, but I liked it.
---
That's the first we've heard of [Bangar Ruinbringer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bangar_Ruinbringer), the Blood Imperator, in five years. It's also the first we've heard of this Crecia character who doesn't even have a wiki article, of Rytlock's past and his cubs, and of course the main thing: how he got Sohothin. That part still feels a bit weird. I don't mind that he just stole it from the Flame Legion. The link is weak (basically just "yo it's a magical fire artifact" isn't it?), I'm surprised that it being a gift from Balthazar was apparently either common knowledge or at least known to Flame and to Blood's spies, and I still find it a bit weird how they apparently just happened to find it in the Fire Island chain given how much that terrain has changed since Prophecies (didn't that volcano erupt right on top over Rurik?) but at least we finally have something.
---
Nice contrast to how Logan used to chase him around, trying to take that sword from him.
---
Wait...so Rytlock has cubs of his own?
---

I imagine this could be a good use case for a book collection or something similar. 
---
Would it be possible to get a PDF or someting of this? It's a bit iffy to read on the page.
---
&gt; Someone who really cheats would never go through such a pain to contact support and get his account back, 
---
Erm....yes they do actually, if people are willing to lie about dead siblings for Recon Armour in Halo 3 then people will lie and cheat their way to getting their MMO account back. 
---
You think legit cheaters will throw their hands up and give up instantly? Plenty of them have been on here trying to get the community angry enough to force Anet to give their accounts back only for Anet to pour a ton of evidence on the thread and have the community laugh at the OP.

“We don’t want story to be something people read on a blog post”- MO 2016
---
New game direction, bringing back the disaster that was season 1 story telling. 
---
Yeah yeah, Reddit hell here I come. 
---
And then people would have whined about ArenaNet being cheap and not spending any resources on their story. 
---
?
---
Tell all your party to go full dps condi scourge but with parasitic contagion and you will easily clear the fractal. Just epi, ez.
---
All the complaints about gatekeeping or toxic blah blah blah always neglect one thing: most people in the LFG want RAID CLEARS, they don't want to spend 4 hours on 1 boss teaching new people, they want to get the kill and move on.  If you want training there are plenty of opportunities in community guilds and the numerous Raid Training discords so just join one.  You weren't luck at all.  There are hundreds if not thousands who got into raiding exactly how you did.  The problem is some people want to join an LFG group and get a kill with zero experience thus asking 9 other people to carry them.  So, who is more toxic?  The commander asking people for 250 LI or the leech who joins an EXP group looking for a carry?
---
I like teaching new players and such but I'm not looking to teach anyone if I just want a clear.  Look at sports, if someone is hosting an EXP pick up soccer game you think they want to spend 2 hours teaching people how to play or do you think they just want to play 2 hours of soccer?  Are they gatekeeping too?  No, they are not.
---
How about people like you stop acting like the game or the world owes you anything, stop whining or being a baby.  The number of toxic open world or casual players dwarf the number of toxic elitists in raids.  Don't believe me?  Go one burn Octovine and watch the vitriol pour in.
---
Yep! Even the people I know who are physically in Europe play on NA, haha. 
---
Weapons scale to character size, obviously! /s
---
I'm still getting this, I was getting it on my old PC that I've had for about 5 years, I got a new one a couple of days ago, completely fresh install, still getting the exact same bug at the exact same spot. In "Victory or Death" zojja is still appearing like a chequered flag at the end of a race. I don't know if it extends to other characters as I don't actually want to play the story until it's fixed so I just log out.
---
Thing is, T4 *is* difficult for a newcomer. But since most of T4 players have been doing it a long time, plus having pots, they forgot the struggles.  You'll just have to grit your teeth and play it until you're exp.
---
I can solo a T4 boss on my own, so I consider myself an above average player. I can play dps, support, hybrid classes and switch around to better complement PuG comp of the day. I don't have a static so it was necessary to get good and carry.
---
One thing to note, players are still adapting to the new instabilities, which is why some T4 groups still struggles through runs. So yeah, don't get discouraged and keep at it. I'll say one thing though, once you've tasted fractal CMs, normal T4s are a cakewalk :)
---
So the first story is Rytlock, I believe one is Caithe. My problem is who is the one with the rifle.
---
&gt; Someone who really cheats would never go through such a pain to contact support and get his account back
---
Actually, if you weren't aware, I've heard that it's common for cheat sites to strongly encourage you to kick up as much of a fuss with support as possible if you get banned. Also, I think that the kind of people that cheat are also probably the kind of people to go ballistic at anyone who will listen when they feel upset about something (like a ban). I can understand why they'd want to have a "no appeals" policy, but it's still super frustrating for those wrongly accused (and clearly, that does happen). Cheater just suck so much, causing all these problems. 
---
hmm but revealing a chest only requires around melee range and the light doesn't reveal anything even while at the edge of the tile
---
Hi, Thank you SO much for this. It's working amazingly for me (Ryzen 2700 @4.1ghz 1070gtx)
---
Im just wondering about the locked frame rate at 60? 
---
Is there a reason for this? When the window is unfocused the FPS goes way higher into the 70's/80's but as soon as I click back to the game it goes back down to 60 again?
---
Just wondering if in future releases we will be able to turn the Vsync off? 
---
In the central room with Frodak? Never really checked that since there is usually nothing but there are two more chests on the path to the mastery point.
---
Or a mini, title, weapon/armor skin aka anything that drops/can be acquired from specific boss.
---
That was better than I expected. I'm really glad that they decided to show us additional info about the world/lore/character developement from an "external" perspective. 
---
Hopefully they do this enough times to even release a small book filled with stuff like this.
---
Queue my grimaces after what? 20 years? LOL
---
Zafirah
---
That and you have to find a group for the Legendary Corrupted Leyspark, but I assume that'll get picked up in somebodies bounty train. Other than that they are all VERY easy to get, and the two standouts aren't really bad
---
Shut up and take my money !
---
Is that Alf on the cover?
---
Anyone wondering why the concept art looks so off-model, it's because Rytlock does not have whiskers.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/6/67/Rytlock_Brimstone.jpg
---
reminds me of a skritt 
---
Looks the way it does ingame when wielded by Rytlock, tbh
---
&gt;and I still find it a bit weird how they apparently just happened to find it in the Fire Island chain given how much that terrain has changed since Prophecies
---
I think this explains, in part, why it wasn't until nearly 250 years later that this thing was unearthed. I'm sure many factions would have wanted their hands on the sword, but traveling to the island chain and trying to find it after everything that happened is probably a tall order that many tried and failed to do. The flame legion is particularly skilled in fire magic, so they probably got by a bit easier. 
---
ERP!
---
Zafirah, the former follower of Balthazar who joined us in Jahai. She brought some Zaishen to the big battle last episode and she's the person you walk past at the end.
---
Rytlock channeling Tybal from the Mists.
---
if you have win 10, use Microsoft Edge
---
But still need to raise they don't send babies to Fahrar, the child need to be around year to be inducted into Fahrar. So not only Rytlock had a woman but also took care of child.
---
I have that one. The Shrine Guardian mount does have a bit of a trail of particle effects.
---
I have pof only so i cant aquire condi gear. Many times i cant join raid pugs because i dont have condi dps. Can you elaborate on this firebrand build and what gear would be best for it? Im seeing a light of hope to get into raiding.
---
Great, thanks!
---
&gt;But a 20 Dhuum kp druid can do that just as well as a 80kp druid. So lower your god damn requirements.
---
No. Any druid can do that in theory, but as you raise the requirements, the chances of the druid you get to be experienced rise. As long as you can get such player in a reasonable time, there is no immediate reason not to do so. KPs don't work too good as a skill check, but that is the best thing we have. Should I remind you pre-hot times where people wouldn't take you in dungeons because you didn't have 5/8/10+k AP? Was that better?
---
&gt;„i'll be top dps anyways lol“
---
For any player that has a chance to be decent this should be a reason enough to  improve. There is no vertical progression in game, so if someone is always "top dps anyway", most likely he is *actually the best*  dps in the group. You don't **actively** strive to his level yourself? You just want to leech your loot and be out? What the fuck is the point talking to you then.
---
&gt;unless you are a NEET with enough time on your hands to grind rotations.
---
Soo, an hour at the golem? Two, maybe? That is more than enough to get your ~85% of benchmark and be a decent player, at least until it comes to encounter practice. Supportish classes don't require even that, usually no one cares even about dps of a warrior, not to say about chronos. 
---
&gt;The hardcore/speedclear raiders are usually pretty laid back and chill, they don't flame in chat
---
That isn't exactly how it works. Hardcore raiders are chill because they they have groups and acquaintances with whom they can play in a comfortable enviroment and usually give zero fucks about your pug groups they joined for some reason (either to try something, just have fun or even patronize others). It isn't their chance to get a clear or something and they can (and will) leave at any time. But be assured, that in their eyes bad players are seen as something even more pathetic than usual. 
---
&gt;and start teaching new players
---
More like "start carrying ~~new~~ lazy players". AnD DON"T YOU DARE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO DO YOU FILTHYY ELITIST META SCUM!!!! That is a typical reaction of gw2 "casual" player when you try to mentor it.  
---
&gt;safe space 
---
And that wasn't even ironic.
---
&gt;We need more guilds dedicated to teaching new and intrested players,
---
I don't see an anouncement for your training group in this post. Go on, create it and see how fast you will burn out. 
---
Even worse that the ears share dye channel with pants. &gt;.&lt; They need to expand/redesign the dye channels on outfits.
---
Request a chargeback, since they were the ones who broke ToS. If the refuse, bring to customer rights office (not sure what it's called in your country).
---
To me there are just many more viable ways of playing rev. I love the energy management too 
---
Berserker power herald or renegade are decent options.
---
Vipers renegade is top condi dps in game outside of fights where confusion is best with mirage.
---
Harrier gear for a healing renegade with perma alacrity
---
And diviner gear is awesome for having great power damage while still giving teammates perma alacrity and 25 might. 
---
Ele is fun but the squishiness gets annoying when you're just trying to relax. You mostly always just play dps. I actually wish ele had weapon swap too. Ele isn't as complex as people say it is, I found it pretty easy to do rotations but if weapon swap was there it would be awesome imo. 
---
Thank you!
---
yes i have :D
---
whoohoo!! thank you!
---
&gt;The LFG - in my opinion - is a wasteland filled with dps obsessed, mentally challenged gatekeepers.
---
Lol, and Reddit is filled with carebear crybabies who want their hand held throughout the entire process. See how stupid generalizing an entire group is? 
---
&gt;Even easy Wings/Bosses require high amounts of li or kp. If you are just starting out, you can't find a group to gain experience/kill proofs and you can't get experience/kill proofs because you can't find a group. And that's our, the communitys fault. There's no one else to blame.
---
Except you're more than able to find training groups to get experience on fights. There's raid training discords such as Raider's Inn, Raiders In Training, Crossroads Inn, etc that will help you with getting introduced to raids, just because the LFG doesn't have them doesn't mean there aren't resources out there that aren't helpful. 
---
Also, it's incredibly stupid to expect someone to take someone with less experience over someone with more experience. That's how it works in the real world also, if someone is more qualified than you are, they will likely get the job over you. I do plenty of pug groups and I rarely ask for KP, I simply say 'EXP LF --- Class - Ping Gear'. I get people who join and they could have 3 kills on Dhuum or they could have 50, I wouldn't know, nor do I care as long as they can do their job. If they fuck up they get kicked, simple as. I'm not trying to sit there and baby someone through a raid simply because they're new. I made the LFG because I wanted to get the kill and move on with my day, not because I wanted to hold someones hand through the raid and spend 3hrs. 
---
&gt;They all complain about a lack of fresh blood in their ranks, but their requirements to even be considered to be worthy of joining are **insane unless you are a NEET with enough time on your hands to grind rotations.** Instead of picking the cherries out of the cake how about creating a „B-guild“ that focuses on teaching already good raiders to be great raiders?
---
Lmfao. Again way to generalize everyone by assuming anyone who cares about their personal performance is a NEET. Just because you can cruise by and have "fun" being a casual raider doesn't mean everyone else shares the same outlook. Plenty of us enjoy min-maxing our classes and optimizing team comps/group dps. Just because we enjoy playing the game in a more try-hard manner doesn't mean we have to take time out to teach what you call "good" players. A lot of the "good" players you meet in Pugs are average at best in comparison to the top players because they simply don't care enough. Players who care more about the gameplay will improve by themselves and seek out help. Expecting people to reach out to you is being extremely self centered. The world doesn't revolve around you, if you need help, go and get help. 
---
**tl;dr**: Get off your fucking high horse. No one owes you anything, if you need help then reach out and get it. Don't expect people to hand feed you because you're struggling. 
---
What are memberberries?
---
ArenaNet doesn't understand social media, twitch included, and modern gaming audiences
---
That was great and I did not expect a whole bunch of lorebombs.
---
But I can't get over Rytlock's face. God have mercy.
---
Lure him into playing fashion wars with the mounts
---
Sorry, but one thing to note is that if you don't like the high requirements of LFGs you need to create your own LFG and put the requirements down that you feel are reasonable.
---
I'm glad there's never a missed opportunity to assume and complain.
---
Game currency clearly has some amount of real world value to someone, considering Guild Wars 2's existence is primarily based on sales of it, and the existence of metric *fucktons* of illegal gold selling websites.
---
I just hope it doesn't go down the route of Blizzard/WoW, where you are required to read the novellas online in order for the plot to make sense.
---
The raptor, springer, skimmer and jackal mounts all have special 'treats' you can unlock from the heart vendors at each ranch, that reward XP once each per mount/per day (server reset). You unlock the treats option on the vendor menu by completing mission chains for each one. Not-bad amount of XP per day if you have spare karma, and you can buy the treats anytime afterward by completing the heart that day.
---
Unpopular opinion:  
---
No. Start a training squad and teach yourselves.  
---
Stop acting entitled to other players time.
---
Because reading another character's thoughts isn't something our characters can do. 
---
Twine gives the devs a great way to do some character development from that NPCs perspective without disrupting the PC's gameplay. 
---
That sounds a bit complicated as opposed to the normal post-mission "(Optional) Talk to your comrades" we got in other episodes. Or maybe even a follow-up in Sun's Refuge... though I guess that's always going to be a no-go due to complications for people who didn't unlock it and upgrade it.
---
Either way, I don't mind an external thing to the website. Could be the first step of a series of promotions to really build up LS5 to have the same launch impact as a new expansion. Having more stuff in the game is great, but sometimes you just gotta let Paul Marketing set up some promos which minimize dev time.
---
no matter the lapse of logical thinking that was/is required to purchase fo76, what they did is false advertising and as far as i know, that is illegal. bethesda realised the potential for lawsuits and decided that actually delivering the product that they said they would was cheaper than getting sued. so much for the great canvas shortage of 2018.
---
&gt; no one cares even about dps of a warrior, not to say about chronos.
---
This has become less an less true tbh, especially with all the recent patches. And for even longer about Warrior in my mind.
---
Oh no I meant the catacombs path that leads to the Mastery insight. On the map they appear near where that room is and you can get some chests going through those catacombs so that's why I figured it might be pointing to one of those.
---
That's just Rytlock's perception based on the events. He is in shock and therefore an unreliable narrator. 
---
Autism alert
---
how low-level does the process have to be to produce that hash?  
---
does this mean i could theoretically be banned by running troubleshooting/memory scanning softwares as admin?
---
I'm so glad we got to see Kormir in GW2, see how she changed since GW1. Nice to see some artwork devoted to her!
---
This was good. More content that gives insight into the side NPCs and fleshes them out is a good thing. This short vignette format is an excellent way to give depth to the characters and help build bonds between them and the player. People will complain that this should be in game, but honestly, at this point, I don't care how we get content like this just so long as we get it at all.
---
that sounds more my style, unfortunately i'm on NA. sad boys
---
I think that a safe middle ground for you will be to join parties that seem to have an idea about what they're doing. Don't join KP parties because you don't have KP. But try searching for parties that show meta comps, aka there are no necros. Also read what's written, don't join if they look for cdps, necros, casual runs or 'healer,' most of people writing healer mean a casual run with any healer that heals instead of a druid that provides buffs and heals.
---
Also look for P+F parties, that's also something you won't see in casual runs as often.
---
Or just find a guild
---
DXGI forces to vsync or frame skip in windowed for locked refresh rate displays. The only thing i can do is add frame skip, but it will show you same or even less frames actually, with counter showing more, if you want go unlimited: use fullscreen.
---
I wonder what the commander would say to Rytlock if he knew how he feels...
---
About 70% of this sub are toxic raiding elitists that will tell you only "git gud or gtfo". Post here anything related to raiding critique and sink your karma into oblivion. Move this thread to official forums for better measure.
---
Is there a guild or discord for people looking to do map completion/world exploration? It’s a little difficult and tedious to do it alone sometimes. Playing on NA btw
---
A just dessert for giving everyone eye cancer
---
You should maybe look up what let's go's story is. It's actually a remake of that.
---
I've noticed a lot of artists tend to make the hilt way too big (because it's a decorative dragon and they focus too much on it), making the sword look short and bulky.
---
If you just make the dragon head on the sword look smaller (in that artwork specifically), it actually would be a pretty believable size for humans, at least by GW2 standards.
---
Yeah, that's more the fault of Banners than Berserker as a spec. Berserker is very well balanced for being a pure-dps spec, but Banners are just insane. Honestly beating the dead horse, though. Anet will never nerf Banners.
---
Watch out you say something and people start losing their minds. 
---
It strange how people forgot season 1, and crucify people for being scared of them bringing that content delivery back. 
---
There was not that many banned in total. I think it was around 800? Yet I think that basically every modern OS has different layers of security level ("run as admin"). Well....who knows.
---
Load 5 fixed dummy characters in map on different camera angles. Every viewer will get projection of what dummy cameras see. So the load will fall on viewers internet capacity to fetch a pov from dummy char instead of actually loading character in map with their own perspective.
---
Just putting this here as it hasn't been mentioned here yet:
---
If you can stack exp buffs (multiple stacking boosters + food and other exp buffs), it is insanely quick to gain mastery exp by killing mobs that grant max bonus exp.
---
Knowing a good place is the trick to this, but usually just go kill stuff you'd normally not kill ever (completely out of the way of travel routes, not heart/event related, annoying/usually skippable mobs). Get to 10 stacks of the killing spree bonus prior to starting your farm, and try and get a long chain of areas with good exp (killing mobs to refresh your killing spree buff when moving to or testing an area).
---
I don't usually time myself, but finished all of the griffon masteries definitely under 2 hours, at a guess I'd say it was 45 minutes.
---
Did roller beetle as well in about an hour or less I'd say. Your mileage may vary depending on your build and your spot(s) that you farm.
---
It is because those whiskers, remove them and face look sort of acceptable. But with Whiskers he looks like Skritt.
---
Knew it was gonna be the plagueofgripes video before I clicked it but now I have to (re)watch it anyways :\^)

---
I'm not sure you understood everything correctly, while I (partly) agree with you that probably nothing would be ever enough in terms of their apology, I do NOT agree on the "ban and ignore" situation. Because it was exactly this. They DID stop looking, they ignored us. It was only after I pointed them towards their own mistake (after fighting for 9 month with various instances of their customer support to even get the proof of this) that they realized that they indeed did make a mistake. 
---
Would it not have been for this they would have kept their "you are all cheaters, we're sure about that" stance. It would also mean that everyone who was falsely banned would have one strike on their account, so in the next instance of this (and without notification the same mistake could happen again) would result in a permanent ban. Again without any means of appeal! 
---
It did cost me so much more time and energy to even fight their stance because they didn't listen to my initial proofs and instead were so full of themselves thinking they couldn't possibly make a mistake. Their apology was made in private, not in public. While they slandered us as cheaters in public. Heck Chris Cleary even made some twitter posts (which he later deleted) boasting how many people he just banned to push his ego or at least his reputation as the wielder of the banhammer. 
---
This isn't a single mistake, it's a chain of mistakes. The least of it I blame on the poor coder who wrote the code that resulted in false positives. I also do not blame the lower customer support workers. But at the point where my communication reached the customer support lead there should have been some kind of investigation. But that never happened. Even after I filed a broad GDPR complaint they never once thought about looking at their data again to see if they maybe could remedy the situation early. They just went through with their stance and told me that I was banned over rules that make the gameplay fairer and welcoming for others and I need to understand that if I hadn't used a program I would not have been banned ... well guess how fair I think it was ;)
---
If you are blocking third-party cookies in your browser you have to un toggle that option, it fixed it for me
---
It's honestly a huge burst heal, even without healing power. Sword is the offensive power off-hand and Shield is the defensive off-hand.
---
He has a giant bonfire with him all the time, they probably get singed off pretty often.
---
I really enjoyed this too and I honestly wouldn't mind seeing it after every release, just showing us what else is going on in the world that our character can't witness himself.
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
Stories like this are too frequent with Anet. 
---
The fact this situation had to be solved by the player makes it even worse. Anet makes a mistake and the player looses everything by no fault of his own. This is unacceptable.
---
And this compensation if we can call it that is not even anywhere close to the trauma (not hyperbole) caused by this "oopsy". Everything about this is disgusting beyond belief. From poor support to GDPR procedures to the conclusion. 
---
Anet should feel ashamed and we as a community should not take this lightly. This could happen to anyone of us and we as a community are quick to denounce that same community as cheaters. Because Anet can be trusted, right? 
---
I absolutely feel awful for purchasing gems 10 mins ago. In a saturated market, these kind of things are so incredibly dumb.
---
I don't even know how they can compensate these players. This compensation does not cost them a thing. And the damage by this goes beyond a few purchases. 
---
I don't know if it's just me, but I see shades of your comics' influence creeping into the main story, and now this. Rytlock's inner monologue could give Snargle's a run for its money.
---
Oh my God
---
I read that has the central mountain from Sinnoh
---
it's canon.
---
It's not that the battles are hard, it's that random encounters break your focus when you're trying to navigate a cave
---
I haven't played the Herald shield in a while, but unless you spec into healing power, the Shield 4 heal is pitiful and difficult to use.
---
I read the mountain name has the central one in Sinnoh
---
shit, maybe companies do this because its better to wrong fully ban someone, and never be caught.  I mean, if you wrongly ban someone, you lose one customer.  If you get caught doing it, you lose more I would assume.  
---
Reading this made me sick to my stomach, and brought back so many bad memories. 
---
ANET accused me of cheating, and deleted my first GW2 account. I had done nothing at all; I had in fact taken a few months off from the game, and upon returning, couldn't log in, which prompted my email to support. They informed me I had been using an exploit or rule breaking, and terminated my account. An account I had played on for years, had bought gems several times, had worked hard to develop (had world explorer, several legendary weapons, etc). All gone, poof, and there was nothing I could do.  
---
I wrote email after email, and met with stony refusal to do any investigation. At one point they even sent me a copy of their game rules, like "Here, you figure out what you did." Only problem was, I knew I hadn't done anything. I hadn't even logged in, in months, for personal reasons. But I've played MMO's for ten years and I'm extremely careful about following the game rules. I never, ever, do anything shady; I won't even swear in chat. I thought perhaps my account had been hacked during my absence and asked them to please check for suspicious IP addresses, but again, they refused to do anything.  
---
My sister and several of my guild friends even wrote emails to support and appealed to ANET on the forums, begging them to look into my situation and restore my account. Until that point I had been a huge fan of ANET and GW2 - I had brought several friends and family members to the game and genuinely loved it. I had never been hacked before, but I assumed that if something like that happened, customer support would work with you to restore your account, NOT delete it outright and accuse you of cheating! 
---
I felt so powerless and blindsided. I remember crying in frustration and disappointment. This was years ago, but I still feel bitter about this and unable to trust ANET. I have tried a couple times to pick up GW2 again (on a new account), but the poison is in the well. It's hard to get over, in spite of how much I love the game. 
---
Honestly, a simple "sorry, we made a mistake," would restore some of that lost trust.  
---
they're so short that i don't know how they'd do that, but if you say so
---
It's been mentioned back when the content was fresh. Someone made a big theory post about Lyssa/balth relationship.
---
These are all good points that I agree with, but you gotta remember that you can't compare 2 classes with 1 ability. Herald has a lot more versatility than Warrior does, which extends much further than just 2 shield skills. 
---
Herald is a support class so it's got a supportive #4 shield skill. Warrior is a selfish class, so it's got an offensive #4 skill. 
---
While I wouldn't be opposed to seeing Herald shield getting some interesting changes, I really like the feel of shield #4, and I always have :/
---
Maybe Rox is his daughter?
---
Probably unpopular opinion: this has to be in-game, I personally don't care in what format - text, audio, dialogue, cinematic, anything. It is important that all the story can be accessed IN the game, not outside of it.
---
Though to be fair - thanks for at least some way of introducing player base to more lore.
---
That's the thing though...they didn't really "get caught". OP was persistent, but it's not like he had any power to force them to do anything. They could have been silent and buried it. That would have been better for them. How is that good for us?
---
VM is more valuable per unit.
---
However, if you ever cash in on Unbound Magic, use the Ember Bay vendor for the 40s per bundle option is more profitable per UM.
---
This would be so broken. I'm just saying. 
---
It would end up being a requirement.
---
it locked to vsync, meaning max 60
---
But the official forums is like 80-90% people who never put a foot in raids and people that actually say they are entitled to legendary raid armor even when playing dps player that pulls less than 7k (yes this is true, someone made a post saying the person that called him out in exp raid for pulling 7k should be banned and it shouldn't be allowed.) use random gear and are basically useless.
---
Yes sure, the official forums is way better than reddit which has a bigger population for both casuals, casual raiders and "elitist" raiders.
---
It's actually got a 1,600 flat heal, which is pretty nice for having no healing power.
---
[Rytlock's secret progeny](https://i.imgur.com/GjYqqOe.png) [^^src](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Assaulted#Dialogue)
---
alter, was zur hölle... 
---
I think they should draw the line at not thinking an empty string is fucking evidence of cheating.  
---
&gt; (and the idea of him being loyal is h i l a r i o u s l y biased writing whoo nelly)
---
Actually I find the idea of Rytlock being a daddy kinda fun. 
---
Also consider that he's a Blood Legion daddy, not an Olmakahn, so it still retains the baddass factor if the writers respect their own lore.
---
I think it's nice that Rytlock has a life of his own outside the military, but it's also a sign of good characterization he rarely talks about it.
---
I disagree with worthless. You can get a max of 19 pristine fractal relics a day (if you do all the fractal dailies and both CMs), meaning that's a minimum of 27 days for a full set. I can't say exactly how long it took for me to get a full set of Ascended Trinkets from LWS3, but I doubt it was more than 1 week. And that was 1 week of a single character not directly farming.
---
Why? I read it in Faren's voice.
---
Bruh when i get off work ill take you through some t4's 
---
I could see Rytlock getting a staff, wanting to protect others properly instead of being on the frontlines (at least after this story). Hell, with staff he could sit on the front line and still protect people. Or he could go either Spec, Glint to remember and be acknowledged by her, or to promote the Charr legacy and go Renegade.
---
hahaha same!! i completely forgot it existed and had a bit of a giggle again xD
---
Ok, I followed the steps exactly. Any suggestions why the log folder is not showing and what I can do to remedy that? Thanks~
---
Wait, what?
---
Mhh interesting, those eyes actually work a tiny bit better than the one the artist made. 
---
Or - as calculable as it though is - a greatsword revenant. 
---
But his kid is still in the Farar according to this, says he may never see them again, he still sees Rox on the regular.
---
Rytlock would surely use another sword, just not one from a god
---
&gt; They could have been silent and buried it. 
---
Which they tried. 
---
&gt; That would have been better for them.
---
At that point, I would have gone to the media with my findings. I thought countless times of posting my story here in this subreddit, even with half the information to make people aware of this and maybe do their own research or GDPR request. I know this sounds weird, but first and foremost I wanted to clear me and possibly many others from their baseless accusations. 
---
Aaaand, cut off the ears, *again*, just like the last outfit.  
---
Is it seriously so hard to plan around something that's been in the game for well over *6 years*?
---
(thx for the link, by the way :3)
---
I mean, I think Season 1 was ideal content delivery, including its non-repeatable nature. I understand that it's not sustainable for a game, but that's really regrettable. I'd def switch to a subscription model to go back to Season 1 style of lore and play.
---
The world used to evolve. Now we have to functionally time travel every time we switch maps. 
---
Yes it's probably faster but i wouldnt get tools just for that! Like, maybe farm 1 set from LS then go mist trinkets. 
---
And i definitely wouldnt get tools just for one set (especially since you can easily get rings and ammy from laurels)
---
It's worth exactly $0, because ANet has full control over supply, price and suffers no manufacturing costs for premium currency.
---
Had they mailed him those 30 bucks, it would have worth.
---
Still, at least they owned to it.
---
Thank you for your persistence. It probably made the game better for everyone. 
---
Like, where? Did i miss it?
---
I enjoyed that more than I thought I would. Normally out-of-game lore can be hit or miss with me, but this was enjoyable! Somewhat off-model art aside (it's still really good - Jacinto does great creature art), it was cool to get in Rytlock's head. I was one of the ones anticipating some kind of conflict with him after All or Nothing, so it's interesting to see that's not the case. I was also surprised about the cubs - I figured he had probably had one, but it's still weird to actually hear it mentioned. Like meeting your coworker's kid for the first time and realizing "oh, there's a mini you out there." I also liked the description of Logan as a 'friendly siege.'
---
I mean, it could be made into a Fractal.
---
Currently experiencing this bug. I talked to Gorrik, grinded my beetle mount, then did the chain that led to this event. I haven't done anything else in the quest.
---
idk, definitely has fractal potential
---
Did you read it? 
---
He was loyal at first but after meeting Balthazar he woke up and realized how god damn stupid he had been and now he pretty says "Fuck everything, my friends are their morning the Dragon". 
---
I agree though, I don't like the rat looking Rytlock
---
It's not THAT useful, I personally find it difficult to aim in a large melee.
---
Ikr. That is practically my first comment on seeing this ultra short story. 
---
Could you PM it?
---
Amazing, I have the same exact problem but in reverse. I find open world players to be kind and jovial and raiders to be raging dicks, which is the reason I completely gave up on that game mode. 
---
god damn toxic lightbulbs have invaded this game!
---
Charr in general dont have whiskers (in game at least).
---
Had the same issue but a simple repair on client fixed the problem
---
ArenaNet has always been such smug pricks when it comes to their ban waves. It's always hilarious, but unfortunate for the victims, to see when their draconian stances are inevitably shown to make mistakes though they always insist that's impossible until it actually happens.
---
Yes it needs a rework. It's awful support. It's barely even support in the first place. Shield #4 has such a pitiful radius that you'd be hard pressed to grant allies Protection in the first place. Try it.
---
However, I would not change Shield #5 much. At the very least, keep it a 3s block, maybe even buff it to 4s. This skill is used a lot in niche pve scenarios such as when Hand Kiting. 
---
Just change shield #4. Proposal: Big radius. 10man boon extension.  Not only would that see some niche uses (possibly replacing a Chrono?), but it's also fitting to Herald's niche of boon duration and extension.
---
I went straight to the Arkjok farmlands as my first subquest. Before getting to the buggy part, however, I've collected the caches for the beetle mount's first achievement. I think that was the order that I followed. Didn't do the other subquests beforehand; the buggy one was my first pick, lol
---
Lies, no one gets turned away from East. All are welcome to the afk lane. 
---
Pretty sure that’s the whole premise of this post, it’s the reverse of what most people believe
---
you know whats better? put canine ears on giant cats!
---
People in raiding tend to be very, very presuptuous. It's very easy to outDPS the Soldier's DH and assume that your 14k is good. Most players probably wouldn't have alts, so Chronomancers and Druid would actually think that they're good because they've never met with another player of their class (checking logs for the other subgroup's uptime is very advanced for LFG heroes). The game is so easy that even those players can complete the content and get their LI, they might even find some players from an actually good guild in their weekly VG kills that'll actually get them past the first gorseval 33% and eventually get into high LI groups, and this will just reinforce their ego even though they haven't exactly accomplished anything impressive, so when someone comes around and tells them that using Dagger 5 on Deadeye is actually a DPS gain they'll get mad and not listen, and when most of the people that you say this to tell you to fuck off, you eventually stop trying. And this is all not to talk about the people that make 250LI groups without even fulfilling the requirements.
---
If you're NOT one of those people, you probably found a guild by now, and don't ever have to touch that thing again, and if you can't because social awkwardness/I Play How I Want/guild quit the game what have you, you either quit raiding or are incredibly obstinate, which eventually leads into frustration and falling into the same tactics as the group above.
---
Basically what I'm trying to say is that the LFG will intrinsically only attract the sort of people that wouldn't listen to this post, or even read it in the first place.
---
Frognog
---
Skrittlock
---
The above indeed. They probably /also/ didn't put it into the game because these particular characters are characters that are very unlikely to spill their hearts out to anyone, not even the Commander. Caithe, Rytlock, Zafirah. They're all pretty stoic and withdrawn people who have denied us information in the past. In case of Caithe, this caused us to completely misunderstand her intentions and had her sort of ruin her good reputation in season 2. In case of Zafirah, she explicitly didn't tell us more about her past in Sun's Refuge. I found the selection intriguing, but considering this, it makes even more sense. 
---
Yea, it's nice to have a lot of choices, same like with Mesmer. Btw I wouldn't call power herald too viable, but let's be real, you can play absolutely anything and get the job done(unless it's some kind of super efficient speedclear). People just overreacting.
---
Attunements=weapon swap. Sw/D rotation is pretty easy, compared to staff. Weaver overall complexity is coming from its squishiness and lack of "default" defensive skills/traits. If talk only about rotation - renegade is much more complex. I haven't played DH, but their rotation might be harder too.
---
For some reason I still love my weeber and allways playing it. Only swap to Mirrage @Matthias/SH/Largos :D
---
well the jave code is a mess .. o_O  pls fix that @anet
---
Fully agree on this. These are Rytlock's deepest thoughts. Unless we stumble across his "secret diary", which would be cheesy as all hell, this is just not to be realistically implemented. The game is also not set up in a way to give us insights like these by playing as the specific characters themselves. 
---
Really now ... considering the example messages the raid equivalent would be people messing up the boss mechanics. Raiders are friendly and jovial while people are screwing up *simple* mechanics?
---
The Teq thing is due to scaling. That is partly on ANet for poorly designed scaling and I guess partly on you for not knowing I guess but that one is a bit difficult to pin down. However it is similar to going into every raid like you've never done it before.
---
In a way you are exactly as bad as the people you are criticizing. Perhaps you also have the typical attitude of "Open world is so easy why does anyone even need to know anything" which is unfortunately not true. While knowing everything is not an absolute necessity there is still a very noticeable difference between doing some events with people who know what they are doing and doing it with mostly clueless people.
---
I always assumed the host for the training group is the one training others and not the one learning?
---
Isn't that how it MOSTLY works?
---
If not, i might just try it!
---
Pretty sure most players aren't like this though certain game modes bring out the worst in people.
---
Actually, I like this image more. Suits the mood.
---
This is beautiful. The last scene had me tearing up.

I really hope we get to see more of Rytlock's development in the future. He ain't done yet.
---
Sometimes posts go right over their heads.  Thanks for getting it ;)
---
Do you think the Gods stay in heaven because they, too, live in fear of what we've created here on tyria
---
In "Beast of War" at the end of PoF he gives us Sohothin to use and then what does he fight with?  A greatsword!  I hope your right about revenants using them.  It's something I've wanted for a long time too.
---
Most people who are invested enough in the storyline to care at all will see this. It's too deep and too much to fit into a living story episode, and it would be cheesy to just find it written down somewhere. With how Rytlock's personality is set up, he would also never tell us all of this in person. And with how the game is set up, we'll never get to play from his perspective for that long. 
---
I understand that splitting story content across different media is something that people might not like, but in this case, I think it is for the better. And most will see it or hear about it. 
---
Had this bug sometime early this month. Went for that village with plagued crops first and got the bug. Waited about 2 hours til daily server reset with no spawns. Logged off. Logged back in about 30 minutes later and required loyalists spawned right on top of me.
---
Good old Poe's Law
---
Git Gud.
---
At the end you get the Petercopter.
---
He looks much older in this drawing, his fur starting to turn grey.
---
Does Charr hair grow gray as they turn old?
---
That's under the assumption you do map comp / dungeon currencies and whatnot though.
---
I think Crystal Desert wins out in most cases (huge bonus if you want the skins as well). The Wintersday and Halloween Tracks are pretty great, too.
---
Seems like the part where he mentions leaving Cre, choosing Sohothin over having a family.
---
Neat, which JP is this anyway?
---
Dark and traumatic ones?
---
nice thanks!
---
my character worships her. meeting her was epic!
---
True.  We haven't established that as a convention in GW2 (although it's possible we could), and I think there's no way we could dive as deep (and long) in that format as we were able to do here.  But I take your point, and we appreciate the feedback and consider it as we move forward.
---
CAP WE MISS YOUR BEARD. (Sorry, leaving now)
---
*Casts chain lightning at nothing in particular*
---
Yeap, can't beat a Mighty Swindler Mask of Dwayna.
---
i edited to not spread wrong information.. so.. would you now go and fuck yourself?
---
I'm assuming the sharkmaw caverns one in LA, thats where I used to camp mine years ago.
---
because there are terrible people everywhere and there always will be
---
thing can get especially bad when you there is a mix of overly serious with those who seem to be outright proud of their inabilities ...
---
If they're like cats and dogs, not really, but their fur may become duller with old age.
---
This is the best choice indeed.
---
It's nice to see the use of interactive novel format. 
---
It keeps people engaged reading since they are not discouraged by large pieces of text. It makes it easier to read, and keep you from having your eyes dart ahead and read things too soon.
---
This might be a spicy take but those damn asura are gonna be the end of us all.
---
But every single player downloaded the latest patch, all of it. Yet not all of them have the issue, why is that?
---
because you get an occasional 2g?
---
i dont know, maybe not everyone who downloaded the patch is playing the personal story, afaik it only happens in the personal story and not living world, correct me if im wrong.
---
They are and aren't allowed. Basically, if it has nothing to do with combat, they are allowed. There's probably more detailed exceptions than that, but for example you can macro instrument songs and stuff like that and they don't care.
---
I don't really know how Anet would feel about someone faking KP with them, but I'm guessing someone faking KP probably wouldn't care. As far as the game knows, all you're doing is pinging items, cause that's what the game is effectively doing when you ping items.
---
[I deserve this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxmkAoLC6_4)
---
Also, what if Rox is Rytlock's cub? He showed some very special affection towards her, and told her to "Take care of herself" in LWS 1. He also called her cub on several occasions, so my money is on that.
---
My waiting paid off, I got my shiny mount skin for 1600gems. That's the only skin for mounts I'll ever buy to be honest (2000 is way too much overpriced, actually even 1600 is. I would only buy mount skins if they are 800 gems or that, which sucks because I also want the gecko).
---
&gt; RIP Hands.   
---
I reprogrammed a few keys and balanced a shot glass full of quarters on my mouse. Anet wants to play stupid games? Fine. I'll abide you 1 click rule. 
---
i knew something was off. At first glance i thought he looked more like some sort of a rat 
---
When's your next run?
---
[We've gotten worse.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/90/Into_the_Labyrinth_loading_screen.jpg)
---
If that is the reference they're making, I genuinely think that's metaphorical family, since charr culture is all about warbands as families. He could have had her as a partner he can trust.
---
He's making a whole comparison about how Aurene is our "daughter," how Dragon's Watch has been a "family" to him. I don't think we have any reason to believe that Crecia as family was any more physical than those.
---
I can understand that, but they would be getting more sells with cheap prices, leading to eventually get more money i think. 
---
I'm loving this, it's great to see the way these characters think.
---
And we finally got so many year old questions answered! Hope you're allowed to make more of these in the future.
---
I mean, not too far from reality, I see more toxicity in open world meta event than in raids/fractals.
---
You’re focused on just Tengu. There are other races. And no, Tengu as a race did not participate, only a small number of them did on their own accord while the rest were isolationists. Also, voice acting would be immensely more costly if you need themto go through every story step. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’d want to cut having to do that
---
They actually have some really awesome stories in their blogs. It's one of the reasons why people really want ANet to find ways to offer them in game as books/journals kind of like Elder Scrolls books and notes or like SWtOR lore logs. Some of the ones that come to mind are like the blog about the [early lore of Mr. Sparkles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mr._Sparkles,_A_Tale_of_the_Asura) or the that [Canach was on the run with a hit on his head, and was going around lopping off the heads of assassins that he kept in a trophy bag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Canach%27s_Story:_An_After-Hours_Meeting).
---
Based on the community's response so far, I'd say there's a pretty decent chance we will.  :-)
---
And now to await Wooden Potatoes 2 hour lore video on this. :D
---
Script: Top notch, pretty great writing.
---
The art: Since when did Rytlock become a mouse? And why does Logan looks like.....why doesn't Logan even remotely resembles Logan???
---
I'm really eager to read Caithe's story.
---
That's nothing!
---
Remember how it took 3 years to implement ping counter? And it's still hidden in options menu? Or how it took 3 years to even implement FoV slider (with pathetic range of zoom)? How many years it took to implement something so basic as being able to type the number of items you want to buy instead of clicking every. Single. Fucking. Item. Separately? Those aren't complicated game mechanics, or engine reworks, or new features requiring dedicated team of devs. Those are basic MMORPG features, like being able to freely move UI elements (which GW2 won't let you do either, but I get that it's a design choice - it grew on me).
---
Oh and the cherry on the shit cake - memetic chair update. About as cringy as Todd Howard joking on E3 about re-releasing Skyrim on another platform and how buggy Bethesda stillbirths of games are.
---
...and you expect a *rework* of entire game branch. Curb your enthusiasm.
---
Try r/guildrecruitment and see if you can find a PvP guild that can coach you. 
---
Joining an active guild is honesly one of the best decisions I made in the game. It makes you feel less like it's just you and a sea of interchangeable strangers. 
---
Charr tend to refer to any younger charr as "cub." It's like calling someone "kid," (only without the meme associated with edgelords using it). So I don't think that's grounds for anything spectacular.
---
And especially after this new information, it could just be that Rytlock felt a special connection with her because he knows what it's like to be cut off from his warband while still aspiring to greatness. Sees a bit of himself in her. Though probably not genetically.
---
Oh ok, that does sound really useful. Doubt I'll master that for a while but I'll try to keep that in mind, thanks.
---
&gt;it'd give moderately viable way of getting old world currencies.
---
Whats wrong with PvP/WvW Reward Tracks?
---
Y tho?
---
I prefer to take it as there's toxicity everywhere and comes down to individuals versus over generalizing specific groups which actually leads to more toxicity.
---
Madness.
---
It's Hellraiser all over again.
---
&gt;they cant upgrade from dx9.. so community is currently doing it..
---
This one I take issue with. This isn't as simple as it sounds. The "plugin" you're referring to is basically code that translates DX9 calls in DX12 calls. Basically the same thing WINE does for DirectX -&gt; OpenGL and DXVK does for DX10/11 -&gt; Vulkan.
---
Not to mention that it's prone to crash a lot right now.
---
That said, there's nothing wrong with community-maintained plugins. As long as ANet approves and doesn't block this, it frees up dev time to work on other things. I feel like we put a lot of expectation on ANet for dev capacity that they probably don't have.   
---
I can't speak to ANet specifically, but I've researched compensation for gamedevs vs those in my own Software/Tech field. GameDevs on average get paid less than Software devs/SysAdmins, yet are expected to work harsher hours.   
---
Things in all technical fields have to be prioritized by the business, there are plenty of times that we've delayed fixing something or adding in a small feature because a bigger feature set had to be completed first. The business runs on money and (for ANet) that money is content and expansions, not game features. Content brings in new players and provides a revenue stream, new features don't (except when packaged with an XP). It sucks, but that's the reality (most of the time).
---
Why force people to play modes they don't enjoy to get currencies they could have gotten from modes they *do*?
---
I get it, they don't have time/money/motivation to fix dungeons and have no idea how to incentivize people to play them, but shifting the blame on *players* ("Why do you expect us to fix #1 way of getting stuff, if you can get it from #2? Oh, you don't like it? Well tough shit!") is not the best way.
---
I was doing this story with my friend around christmas, back then we personally had no issues. Hopefully this information will be helpful for you for narrowing down time window when this got introduced.
---
&lt;insert joke about current political climate&gt;
---
You can cheese CoF P1 by blinking past a specific trigger point, then its duoable: https://youtu.be/11jjOPAjF_0?t=296
---
Other than that a lot of paths are duoable, not all are fun though. I personally enjoy(and tastes might differ):
---
AC: P1,3
---
CM: P1
---
TA: Up, Fwd
---
CoF: P1
---
HotW: P1
---
CoE: Just no unless you get really good at the laser thing
---
Arah: P2,3,4 if you feel bored and have time
---
No one has mentioned this yet in their responses, but the story in GW2 is a single continuous story. Each expansion has some self-contained story arcs, but there are threads that start in HoT and continue through living world season 3 and into PoF. So if you care at all about experiencing the story in GW2 in order, without spoilers, then you'll have to do HoT first.
---
Thanks for that!  I agree it would be great if we can find a way to preserve things like this somewhere in the game or shell so that people can visit, or revisit, them.  I'm not sure what the tech limitations might be, but we'll talk to engineering and see what's possible.
---
Formerly worked at an infosec company. This type of process is so strict because it's not really that hard to fake or spoof enough data to pretend you are someone you are not. 
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
They essentially did that with the end-of-instance dialogue already. I assumed because of the way All Or Nothing ends, they avoided that and faded to black for impact, and put some of the extra dialogue here.
---
That is legit sad...
---
no ,its gonna be a melee offhand pistol xD
---
uh, rox looks awesome?
---
Honestly, it's even more dispiriting that so many redditors did not spot the troll here, than that there are so many messages about this every week bitching about "raiding elites".
---
His face is also much "softer" in the art than what is often shown ingame, kinda weird looking.
---
So instead of actually having to play at all you could just literally buy everything without ever leaving the first instance? How does that fix anything at all?
---
Why so?
---
Ah, in true rev fashion! Ranged battlehammer and close combat gun! That's how I like it. 
---
Don't forget the Claypool centaur camp heart. Thankfully the centaur supplies count and respawn pretty frequently (and discretely...).
---
I don’t think it’s supposed to look right, someone lower down commented the picture that the weird eyes were shopped in from.
---
There are no other solutions ANet can implement in their current state.
---
Deaths per second? /s
---
They should have made him a vendor that sells crappy black envelopes so we can use open all on them.
---
They would contain junk worth 1, 4, 14, and 44 copper.
---
They sold Braham helm and shoulders from his outfit. Its possible.
---
Its a mystery for me, really. These ears have no chance to mess with other parts of gear and would generate extra revenue for ANet. Maybe in future..
---
I was hit by this ban wave and received largely the same response you did. I gave up and switched to ESO as my main MMO, much happier.  
---
I'll keep an eye out for that email though, should be pretty funny if it comes up.
---
True! I have to take that back. The Balthazar outfit also came in two parts... 
---
Yeah, we will have to see. 
---
I mean, you can still actually run the dungeons, they are fully doable. 
---
The whispers are like... very whiskery.
---
I bet your pokemon team lacks type diversity, you don't believe in potions, and you have 4 power moves on each pokemon because "the best defence is a good offence" head ass.
---
I'd be willing to bet a Legendary weapon that if the black lion chests were released with even a "Lesser Exchange Voucher" as a guarantee, A LOT of people would be opening them up to get the different game currencies in bulk, so they wouldn't have to grind out those currencies in other parts of the game.
---
And while I want to say it would decrease the value of Legendary weapons because of the sudden influx of obsidian shards and dungeon currency, I feel like the ever-increase cost of the mystic coins to make into mystic clovers would still keep it slow and keep the legendary weapon prices high.
---
&gt;The 4 needs a complete rework. It's 100% a support skill but this makes no sense for the rest of the kit. If you actually play the type of build the skill is designed for, what main hand do you take?
---
I use Shield for Herald Healer. Either works. I personally use sword because it has the higher energy cost between the two weapon sets. Which helps me spend energy below 10 so I can proc [Charged Mist](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Mists) in case that I haven't spent all of my energy by the time my legend stance recharges. This lets me have longer boons + more healing spam. Mace works for some extra might. Shield 5 also uses a lot of energy as well so it is useful to me even if I don't use it to save myself from death. 
---
Shield is very useful for Herald Healer because going from Ventari to Glint is very risky. I can then use staff 4 and then Shield 4 to get a emergency burst healing. 
---
So arenanet should NOT strive for balance and we should all be happy with the game as it is and never change it?
---
fair enough. my bad, i just angry at anet a lot and that clouded my judgement
---
Of course and I really appreciate that! And if it's not realistically feasible then I can completely understand. I just wanted to kind of show that there was at least some interest in it if it's something you all are looking for thoughts on.
---
We don't live our live on this sub or in GW2 for us to get some obscure meta joke.
---
It's a short story, but not ultra short. Did you see that if you click the blue phrases it takes you to the next paragraph? Just making sure you didn't miss it.
---
Yup.  Great to know.  Thank you!
---
You always think that.... at first.
---
And then suddenly you are offloading shit to alts.
---
OOOOH YOU TOL' ME!! #REKT
---
This was my first story point - after talking to Gorrik (the asura) I headed straight for the farms. Currently stuck at this step too
---
Actually interesting that the chest armor is split into two UVW part. 
---
I really would like to know what software they use to create and texture the models. 
---
They fill quickly and then disappear - try making your own LFG. Around reset you should not have to wait long 
---
Thanks a ton. That was very helpful. Appreciate it :) 
---
There are plenty of training guilds, but it does suck that you have to search outside of the game to find them and other training runs (unless you get lucky and find something when searching for "training" in lfg). I'd love it if Anet added a "training" or "training/casual" subsection to the raid section of lfg. That way, people who want quick clears and raid sellers still have their own area, and there's a dedicated space in game for training guilds and groups to advertise and recruit for runs.
---
I'm thinking of unlocking chrono on my mesmer and learning support chrono, using mainly diviners gear + berserker as required. How long did it take you to become proficient at it?
---
Sad hamster
---
Because some people seem to have missed this in the text:
---
&gt; Of course, I couldn’t just steal it. I had to tell my **warband mate** what I was planning. Problem was, Cre was doing too good a job to leave it all behind.
---
This was my first story point - after talking to Gorrik (the asura) I headed straight for the farms. Currently stuck at this step too.
---
Judging from the rest of the comments, it seems the common thing is that we all went to the farms first
---
No problem and thank you too! :)
---
Lol they extended this fractal? Goes to show how little I PvE :&gt;
---
Warriors get good use out of maces. It's actually meta for power raid warrior.
---
You almost had me. While open world is pretty chill overall, I have seen a version of each one of those comments. But the way and excess of the stuff you were describing left me wondering, what the hell open worlds you be playing.
---
Funnily enough, the death threats and comparison to raids and fractals part only made me skeptical. But that gatekeeping part. Yea that gave it all away. 
---
you mean for kiting on deimos?  Rev isn't that common for kiting anymore, after they destroyed the f2 ability.  
---
I'm just going to wait till they make him a shop, then I'll laugh at those people who broke their fingers.

Petition to delete Thief and Mirage from the game

Kiss

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbzQvD\_7G3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbzQvD_7G3s) a bit late but here you go.
---
Eh Obby shards have been pretty easy to get since the berry farm and dungeon currencies are really easy to get with revamped dungeon rewards. If you do not want to run a certain dungeon, you can complete 8 other paths and get 150 currency for it or do 3 paths for 2 days and get 600 currency pretty fast. Also with the expansion power creep, dungeons are pretty faceroll, more than before. 
---
Tradable material costs , world comp and precursors are what keeps leggy prices up. Obby and dungeon tokens are simply a drop in the ocean.
---
I don’t think it’s a particular order as the stall is an event that anyone can see regardless as to whether they have an active story or not. 
---
Honestly, this was a really great read. Thanks for the strong entertainment this morning!
---
I only wish it were ingame. Could be a good use for the newly implemented book system, if ever the architecture is in place.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 literally scams its special edition customers, they decided to give a paltry $5 in store credit, they get reemed out. GW2 screws up a cheat detection program for a small number of players, gives ~$30 in credit plus all missed story unlocks (another ~$30), and they still get reemed out.
---
you mean their monopoly money that cost them nothing to give out? and will probably cost them nothing "even virtually" if players don't come back to the game?
---
Oh boy, they know where to grab me... I'm a fuckin sucker for foxes...
---
Agreed!
---
From what I have seen mentioned before:
---
HoT: Lake Doric farm is the best followed by Dragon’s Stand
---
PoF: Istan and Thunderhead Keep metas are both good
---
Some dungeons can even be done solo.
---
You will have trouble with larger groups of elite mobs, and some strong bosses ofc.
---
But being prepared, knowing the encounter, and having the right tools that you switch around depending on the situation is going to work for sure.
---
The most easy tactic would be going as duo necro minion masters and swarm the enemy with minions while you stay behind and stack conditions on them.
---
You can also have 1 minonmaster necro and 1 thief which can stealth you both so you can skip some parts. Thieves can also perma blind non boss mobs making them deal 0 damage pretty much
---
Nearly a year later and all they get is fun bux and the free content they "missed"? If I were caught in this ban wave there's no way this would get me to come back.
---
You can stat swap your ascended drops btw, just in case you didn't know.
---
You were gone for 8 months from a game that's been around for over six years now and is still releasing new content. Unless something catastrophic happened, it's not going to suddenly be void of players.
---
Lovely asura &lt;3 .
---
I agree, with the caveat that mesmers are something you love or hate. 
---
Illusion-heavy chronomancer is a force of nature with excellent defensive abilities and can hit 3k power with self-buffing might and sustain it for a long fight in general PvE with a lot of ways of taking on crowds of enemies and not taking a scratch.
---
But you have to be okay with the visuals. Some people really, really hate the pink butterflies and clocks aesthetic and you will see a lot of pink butterflies and hear a lot of ticking. 
---
In raids, you'll be shoehorning yourself into support most of the time, which is just something you have to deal with for raids. Chuck wells at people, use ToT and Time Warp and SoI and then DPS until it's ToT, wells and signet time again. 
---
I find that raid communities in any and all mmos tends to be on the toxic side, even guilds of "friends" can become nothing more than an episode of a reality show with all the internal drama.  Haven't raided in GW2 in forever and my experience has been vastly improved.
---
Hello all,
---
Purchased and played GW2 once it was released, played some time after and stopped, friends moved to different games, I followed.
---
Recently wanted to play again, few of my friends decided to join, and now I have few things I need help with.
---
We are from Europe, but for some reason my home world is Maguma NA. Wanted to changes since my friend made account on EU, Blacktide but couldn't do it for free.
---
Will I be able to play PVE content with them, fractals, raids, world bosses?
---
Should I continue my current character, human warrior. Only thing holding me back from new characters is world exploration, since Im over 50% on this one.
---
What build would you suggest for fractals, raids, is my warrior valid?
---
Still dont have any expansion, but will buy If I continue playing.
---
Is there any guild recruiting for PVE content?
---
This was necessary and really funny and creative... never been done before...
---
What is a NEET? O\_O
---
yeah everyone talking about giving bolts to zepherites when its scraps you give. shame really
---
I've never raided before and I've been playing around with the idea of starting a guild specifically for people who know nothing about raids and want to figure out their own strategies as a group without being "taught" how to do them. We would die a lot for a long time, but I think it would be fun, kind of get that new release feel. And I think it would be really cool to see what a bunch of newbies come up with on their own.
---
Grab a bunch of XP boosters and find a dense area of mobs and farm. I got all of the griffon and beetle masteries in less than an hour doing that.
---
I still wouldn't have gotten mine had it not been for me tagging along with a friend who was doing it and practically carried me through the experience.  Had it not been for him I would still not have bothered as the grind was unfun for me.
---
It was definitely a "For Science" kinda deal... Same kinda thing can happen to Sabetha, only that you can kill her and get boss credit but no rewards spawn. This makes it to where you can't go back and get your chest by re-killing it.
---
Will it still work with my motherboard? Sorry, I'm capable enough on following instructions and tutorials but I don't know about compatibility and all that.
---
That may be enough to get the 25AP. But it'll take ages to empty my bank tabs of essences.
---
Shield feels lackluster, but I also think it should still be about utility and support.
---
#Envoy of Exuberance
---
* This skill could also grant some **endurance** to self and allies _or_ vigor
---
* Increase protection's base duration to **4s**
---
* Make the condition cleansing baseline, and increase it to **2**
---
* _Add 2 seconds to any boons on affected allies and self?_
---
_This is an ally-centric skill so it should grant them good utility - the 2s protection and MINOR heal is not noticeable at all_
---
#Crystal Hibernation
---
It roots you which really limits you in what you can do, so you either remove the root effect _**or**_ you make it much more interesting to use despite that handicap - I'm going for the latter:
---
* Bump the base heal per pulse to **750** with a higher coefficient too.
---
* Cleanse 1 condition per pulse as baseline
---
* Grant **10 endurance** per pulse
---
* Grant **5 energy** per pulse
---
_Being rooted needs a solid payoff. This skill is about _**recuperating**_ and recovering, so not just health but also energy and endurance. Let's not forget it has a really lengthy cooldown of 25s too_
---
Good catch. I wonder if there are more of these around. Such a pity the Personal Story characters are so disconnected between each other, and that most of them disappeared once it was over :I.
---
Not specific to any content, but being familiar to the tools available to you is a great help as a commander.  [The wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Commander) has some good information such as things like placing markers and using broadcast messages. 
---
I'd recommend having a look [here](https://discretize.eu/builds) instead for fractal builds.
---
GW2 is terrible at locking veterans out. Gear does not get more powerful. All you are missing is about 1200 LI, 200 dhuum kp and 70 qadim kp. Everything else is just as viable as it was before.
---
Being a toxic fuck is now "insignificant".
---
Wow, look at you singlehandedly that there's a cancer rotting in the raid community. I didn't need you to validate my opinion, but thanks for doing it anyway.
---
The artist is actually very proficient in anthro art which makes this even weirder lol https://twitter.com/sinto_j
---
looks like Hellboy. 
---
GG
---
That feeling when you got a female Charr named Crescia since day 1. So close.
---
Let's Go is literally a remake of Pokemon Blue/Red/Yellow. You are talking about it like it is not exactly what you're asking for.
---
More statuettes, the keys have never been worth their value. Make everything statuette accountbound if you're worried about the economy.
---
A reference to some characters from South Park. IIRC, originally introduced when The Force Awakens came out, making fun of how much the movie called back to the original Star Wars movies as a way of using nostalgia to sell tickets.
---
In this case, OP is basically saying "Expect a ton of nostalgic GW1 callbacks."
---
Raids are full of bullshit, fractals are full of bullshit, open world is full of bullshit, and the "satire" posts are accidentally not wrong.
---
What a world.
---
&gt; where everyone is friendly and jovial
---
You're going to have a bad experience in fractals
---
THERE WAS A GAME WITHOUT THOSE
---
Yea, not creepy at all.
---
Dinky is awesome.

You can only switch for free if you have no characters on your account, and if you do that, I'm pretty sure you lose pretty much everything.
---
And core ranger is not terribly viable for fractals or raids (you need expacs to play raids anyways), so if you wanna go dps ranger, you will at least want soulbeast
---
Also, longbow is not a great dps weapon atm. [This](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) is the current meta build for power rangers in fractals, and [this](https://snowcrows.com/raids/ranger/soulbeast/power/) is the current raid build
---
The worst human behavior I have seen in a game of this nature was in Fractals. 
---
sadly not. getting a ryzen or a new gen intel will require a mobo upgrade.
---
R5 2600 + b450 MOBO.

---
Technically true, but likely they commissioned Jerome rather than Jerome using it on his own.
---
Ok? So you are missing out on fun content because people are big meanies? Still sounds like an excuse to me.
---
I am so sick of this carebear community
---
"LINE!"
---
I know what i do not want to see as uncommon and that is the total makeover kit. Getting that extra drop hoping for a skin or a ticket or the like and you get a total makeover kit is such misserable feeling. 
---
And don't missunderstand me i do like the makeover kits but not as my rare extra box in a blacklion chest.
---
Damn, dont want to loose everything, Dont care about levels, but have bunch of skins I wouldn't like to loose. What if i pay, will i be able to transfer and keep everything ? 
---
"Im rich you know cub?"
---
This issue should be fixed now. Be sure to hard-refresh (CTRL + Reload).
---
I play this game, and played GW1, completely alone. I like the story but am too old and too busy to be bothered with the nastiness I've seen. Years ago, it was elite dungeon groups. But then fractals, the worst human behavior I've observed in a game of this nature was in Fractals and it was annoying enough where I just stopped playing fractals. 
---
My dream is to get 10 people from a guild, all run raid gear, in proper subsquads with proper buffs, just killing south as fast as possible once and only once and then doing the meta normally. The salt in the map chat combined with the loot of AB. Feels good. 
---
Why blame the person when you can instead blame an entire game mode you dislike and all the people who play that?
---
Thank you. you described the picture perfectly. my brain was just like "why does Rytlock look like a sad mouse?"
---
Airplane tickets track the IP, deleting cookies won't really make a difference, what will, on the other hand, is getting a VPN. Honestly, most of the crap cookies save about you isn't that bad, and in most cases won't be used for anything else besides what's there to use, but that's my take on it, there a lot of scarier shit out there, cookies are the least of our concerns.
---
And still there are differences.
---
No, but I now go and report you. :)
---
Watch your tongue.
---
I agree with you, there is something about the more "modern way" in which GW2's story is written, ingame but also with this, that takes me out of it, sometimes. On the other hand, there are occasions when I enjoy it a lot, e.g. I think it works well with Taimi, and not just on the communicator. I wonder what I would think of a re-written, more old-fashioned approach to character dialogue ingame. 
---
Idk. 
---
all of them do
---
wait
---
if Aurene is Caithe and OUR daughter

ARE WE MARRIED TO CAITHE

Happens all time. Merchants on chests etc. You can really report just have to get over it.
---
One that triggers me is portal on chests.  Even more so when I have to Res people under tarir as they all died on chest and then I find I was portaled for doing so lol
---
how is that trolling? it's not like it overwrites the interact option...
---
There's always a way. If you know them you can duo ALL dungeons paths (AC123, CM123, TA Up/Fwd, SE123, COF123, HOTW123, COE123, Arah1234)
---
Except TA Aether.
---
Only if the person is in NA. Reset is nothing in EU since that is in the middle of the night.
---
How ever in EU we have a lot more activity in the lfg-tool and i can not even recall groups asking for kill proofs for just the tier 4 fractals. CM's sure but not the normal daily. If there are any then there are 15 other groups to pick from who do not ask for such thing.
---
Yea, and I have bunch of those. 6 birthdays. 
---
Anyone know when I buy expansion that free transfer will it work for me? Will I be able to transfer my account to eu without deleting characters?
---
Well, people have done it before (you can even see a few examples in the background of Nike's latest open world build videos) and some of them even got posted on reddit. People were not happy about that at all lol
---
I believe it started off in EU.

Lag.

Upon inspecting his work on art station, he draws A LOT of mice. So I'm not surprised it turned out this way.
---
BOOHOO
---
I myself had made some rather hasty and sweeping comments about those who got banned initially. But after hearing it personally from one of my guildies who got unjustifiably banned, I changed perspective. I am sorry for the way you got treated.
---
according to the wiki, you lose your bank contents, coin, and guilds, and I wasn't sure how to interpret "bank contents".
---
That is to say, whether wardrobe and materials were included under your bank
---
They used to be yellow, yeah. Maybe? I don't even know.
---
Pre-HoT, his model had grey eyes, except that one cinematic in Ascalonian Catacomb's story mode and his figurine merchandises, which were yellow. They became light green-ish after he took his blindfold off.
---
[Also don't get me started on how his height shrunk in PoF in comparison to his Core/HoT models.]
---
Sure there are differences. But in the context we're talking about, all visions are prophecies, but not all prophecies are visions.
---
Where can I see the original?
---
What a strange mindset, why on earth *should* everyone be ready to learn and improve in a video game? People play to relax and have fun. What's next, you're going to insist that everyone should be improving the way they watch TV or read magazines? Obviously, a portion of the playerbase (including myself) wants to improve and enjoys that journey. But for the people who don't, yes it is wrong to give them constructive feedback when they don't want it.
---
I don't see any such foreshadowing... what do you see that could be?
---
They should give them something substantial, like unlocking ALL the outfits in the game or something. If I consider all the ways my account has changed in the past 10 months I would be insulted by 2500 gems. 
---
Yeah, baby skimmer minis. If they're not in the next one, I'm going to be pretty disappointed.
---
I mean, even while watching TV and reading magazines, you're processing information and learning new things, or improving in some way. Even simple relaxation is a growth experience, so I respect folks who are looking for that. And if someone doesn't want constructive feedback, I'll respect that too. But my default attitude, if no one tells me otherwise, is to help. That's what I find fun.
---
By the armor stats you mean is it like ESO that in endgame pretty much although there is a meta that makes tou 2% stronger, you can combine different sets depending on your playstyle?
---
Rytlock is a consummate warrior. Perhaps, and this is a *huge* perhaps, given the game's mechanics... Perhaps the next update would see him using a spear.
---
We already have spears in water, and it's been rumored that we're eventually going to get more underwater content at some point, for the sea dragon. 
---
I could see Rytlock taking up a simple spear in an update that gives players the ability to use spears on land... And considering how important the Dragonsblood spear(s) have been, I could see that becoming a thing.
---
I think killing Kralkatorrik will require hits from *everyone* on our ragtag team of misfits, and I think Rytlock will get the penultimate blow before we finish it, or he'll make the coup de grace itself while we keep Kralk busy.
---
Snow Crows builds are built to be the best at raiding as possible, and usually they map extremely well to fractals but Chrono is sadly a case where it isn't perfect. As a solo Chrono it's very hard to keep boons up in fractals without 100% boon duration. 
---
That being said, you'll probably be more than good enough even if your raid gear isn't perfect for fractals. It's not the worst thing in the world if you have too little boon duration in fractals and it's not the worst thing in the world if you have too high boon duration in raids. 
---
Support Chrono is a lot of fun to play, and is the best class to get into raiding with imo, so I do highly recommend it anyway.
---
Feel free to ask any questions about the spec if you have them!
---
1) the story is...decent. It starts off with some decent rpg choices, but the story writing itself was lackluster. The writing has gotten better, but at the expense of less and less choices and more linearity as time as gone on. It's all followed one basic theme though, deal with the elder dragons
---
2) living season is the "free" content between expansions. If you are online during the initial release of the living season content, you automatically unlock it for your account. If not, you have a pay a small price to unlock it. It tells the story that takes place between expansions to your character, along with expanding the world and introducing new content
---
3) PvP has two modes. sPvP which is 5v5 matches where you try to maintain control of point nodes, and WvW, which is server vs server vs server castle siege. Outside of that, there's PvE endgame which is a lot of open world content, large scale map events, fashion, etc, along with fractals (dungeons 2.0) and raids. Fractals are 5 man instances and raids are 10 man (need expansions to access)
---
Save your money and buy a new MoBo, CPU and DDR4 memory later.
---
The money you'll spend now won't improve your gaming experience, it is better to wait more and have a much better system later.
---
Not even *randomly*, given that the Flame Legion was explicitly looking for it. 
---
Rytlock: Logan, I…  
---
Me: NOW KISS!
---
Was literally going "Snargle, is that you?" for some of it. 
---
Cannot put helmet. Outfit. Sigh...
---
What do you mean on 2) that if I am online during the initial release? if i am actually playing the time is released or if i havent played for ages?
---
hol up do i know you? i had this as my discord username
---
That and she stabs him in the leg with a paring knife when he's leaving her.
---
And she tells Imperator Ruinbringer that 'it was to make it look good.'
---
I doubt that. I think it was personal because he was choosing the sword and probably getting himself killed over staying with her.
---
Have around 100 stacks waiting for the 4 winds festival
---
Ehhhhh...i'd say Marjory truly looks good, Rox looks *okay*...Braham is kinda ehhh...
---
And poor Kas looks pretty artificial.
---
What *did* Eir do with Magdaer after recovering it from the Ascalonian Catacombs, anyway? 
---
every 2-3 months we get a new living world episode. If you're online before the next episode comes out at any time, then you unlock the episode. So we're currently on season 4 episode 5. If you play anytime before season 4 episode 6 comes out, then you'll automatically unlock episode 4 season 5
---
It likely varies by individual, just like with cats. In Sea of Sorrows, from what I remember, Cobiah specifically mentions how some of his charr friends' fur dulls, gets flecked with white, or starts to grey in certain areas. And by grey I mean the follicles lose the ability to produce pigment so it fades from whatever colour the fur was to white, not that a charr with orange fur suddenly goes actual grey. (Though orange domestic cats can and do develop black fur/skin patches with age, so if charr go that route it may be possible for orange charr to start getting black fur).
---
Though how often charr live old enough to get visibly grey is another matter, and who knows what spending so much time in the Mists would do.
---
just make more charr until you have each of the legions and the buddy options covered 
---
if i buy the expansion will i get all the seasons?
---
Personally I'm hoping anet embraces all the comments about rytlocks look in this art and adds a skritt acting like rytlock(maybe shadowing him and mimicing) at some point. 
---
I knew that ArenaNet at some point was setting up some "he has family we weren't aware of" story threads on the side, more complex of a reveal than this, but I believe they got abandoned in the last year or so. This is easier to deliver on, I guess.
---
The guess is now, how old are these cubs? Is his oldest old enough to.... say.... *join a guild?*
