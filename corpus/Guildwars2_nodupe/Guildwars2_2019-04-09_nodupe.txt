Seaon 4 won't end tomorrow. In 4 months it's two years.

---
It would be interesting to know how much money Anet earned with PoF and how much with gemshop sales in release quarters. PoF peaked with roughly double the revenue of a non release quarter. 
---
But it was probably a lot more work - and much more expensive - to develop. For Anet non release quarters might be more profitable. A team of, lets say, 100 people working for two years on an expansion is very expensive. You need to earn millions just to cover their salaries. I wouldn't be surprised if Anet needs to sell one million copies just to cover their costs for developing an expansion.
---
---
---
what do you mean by that?
---
haha this is weirdly cute i like it
---
For example the skip in Wing 1 before the spirit run. If mounts would be added this skip would also return.
---
I really appreciate the effort put into those vids (can't wait to see more). One question. Can we hope for a CGI trailer in style of the Guild Wars Factions one for future content under your rule as HoGM? Let's say for Season 5 or a potential expansion 3 someday? That trailer is still one of my favourite video games trailers ever and would love to see more of this.
---
I want a guild hall just to do stuff like this.
---
I am part of VIP but the guild is a little too big for me, I'm still doing Tequatl &amp; TT daily for ascended. But anyhow, i just thought a huge tank mount would be awesome but i'll grind to get Bond of Vigor, there's just too many things to grind for atm.

All I can say is marketing wise...more is coming.
---
boons are applied and condis removed in a certain radius.    
---
The group that is tighter also mitigates more damage as skills only affect a given number of targets.    
---
As WvW players became more experienced, the blob ball was the natural evolution of play.

---
Gotta love pointless stats! I hope we get more of those for the festivals this year.
---
The objects are so big though. Not even world bosses are this huge.
---
I'm surprised moving such big and complex objects doesn't take up more performance.
---
Fractal dungeons? Are you fucking kidding me :c
---
6 episodes across seasons 3 and 4, 8 in season 2, thats 20 in total, I dont recall season 1 having 17 episodes did it? Fair enough if im remembering wrong but that seems wrong to me
---
Honestly no, not really. Especially if it is only you farming it. If you have more people use it (like my guild members that run with me) it is slightly more worthwhile but as you can see from [the wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Garden_Plot_Deed#Value_of_produce) the highest value is not up to 4s with most being 1-2s. So it really isn't going to pay off any time soon on it's own. The other use is to get the [2h primers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flask_of_Metabolic_Primer) but they aren't worth it on most food/utility.

Maybe Kralk put a branded dredge's mind into a branded bristleback's body...
---
I personally think people are speculating more than anything but who knows, this may all change with 500 cooking but I can't predict if it will be worth it then. Right now from a pure value point it is not worth it (especially if converting gold &gt; gems), but then again I have two plots myself and share them. Your original question was is it "worth to buy", and right now the answer is still no. That goes for a lot of the home nodes though in terms of pure gold value many take years to pay off.
---
The best one so far!
---
Since beta..

This is common in most games from what I heard.

All of Nothing came out January 8th, it's now April 8th so it has already been 3 months so April 30th is already 3 weeks past their 2-3 month Cadence, so I think it will be happening then.
---
Well, that's teleporters you know? No way to defend them? They can send as much supplies, troops and golems as they want immediately.
---
Send a few golems to every waypoint and there is chaos in the whole charr territory.
---
He is legend player...
---
Would or could?
---
Cantha is obviously the natural place to go next. However there is still a lot of unexplored space on the map. A 3rd expansion is pretty much essential to keep the momentum of the game going
---
You know why no one heard about it though?
---
*Exactly.*

Thought devs said it was a creation of Kralk and not a bristleback at all though

Charr character: "So, Tribune, funny story. I kind of took a life-binding-oath to always protect Kryta, so if we ever go to war with humans again, or even if my legion gives me a mission to spy on them, I'll be forced to go against the high legions and fight my own people...that's cool with you, right?"
---
Charr character: \*is gutted on the spot\*
---
You do not need anything. Simply logging in for the first time ever on a F2P account will unlock it.
---
You won't be able to play it without PoF and a Level 80 of course, but there are no requirements to unlock except logging in.

They are probably in therapy already about how the new weird "nazi" symbols made them upset
---
See, that's the thing. Most, if not all of my enjoyment from these games is mostly gearing at end game and being the best on server (hopefully) so I would play to the lvl cap even if I didn't necessarily enjoy the leveling process. I'm torn.
---
Cool, thanks for the correction.

I clicked on this thinking there was a new staff skin

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pearl_Shell
---
Looks pretty basic to me. Or do you mean you want a shield with that profile and is literally just a piece of undecorated wood or metal?
---
Asura have friends/family at the Inquest, they live in Rata Sum, they do research next to "normal" Asuras, they are part of their competitions and accepted as persons. The Inquest *is* a part of asuran society and not only "accepted by law".
---
You can still try things out at level cap without the expansions. 
---
Look at the list of official retailers and you can see  different bundle prices for the expansions. The "deluxe" etc version of each expansion is mostly QoL and cosmetic stuff.
---
whoud be interesting to see CHARACTERS DELETED number.
---
Okay, that's very good to know. I will look into this. Any competitive PvE/PvP realms/servers I should be looking at? Just so I'm with my own kind so to speak.
---
Not really heavy tech. From a graphics/physics engine point of view it's actually very simple. So simple in fact that it's why they did it this way at all, because it was easier to rotate the whole river area around the raft than it was to rotate the raft and keep physics working on it correctly.
---
Started playing last year, got world completion beginning of this year, have not posted it on reddit. (Excluding mentioning it now)
---
This is nice CGI. But characters look more cartoonish than actual in game characters.
---
Because breakbars.
---
F2P can't play rev.
---
Right now im hoping for a "Link campaign" and the Gw2 Announce.....
---
I would kill for a small, round buckler.
---
I never knew I wanted CGI stuff for Guild Wars. Now I want it so much. Holy crap that was awesome!!
---
Is it really? The whole point of the rating system is to put you in matches with people around your skill level, which results in a 50% winrate in the long run (especially if you cut the ranking phase which is typically much longer than 5-10 games used for the first placement).  
---
You also don't want a bot that is too good. If you have a bot in high level matchups it is much more likely people will spot that as they have more experience. It is not unlikely that you can make a bot winning most 1on1 fights just because of their superior reaction time, but that will frustrate people and its more likely they spot you are a bot.
---
There is also a lot of stuff that determines a match outcome where you have no influence. A non-insignificant portion of your games your play doesnt matter because your team just loses its individual fights and/or the other team rotates better. You have the games with afk players.
---
It might have been hero fighter thing like tf2/overwatch. But based on gw2 spvp.
---
&gt; I disagree. First off, those aren't settlements, they're merely labs. The only asuran settlements we have are Rata Sum, Thaumanova, Rata Novus, Mrot Boru, and arguably Soreen Draa and Rata Arcanum. And whatever the Uncategorized Fractal is about. All but Rata Sum, Mrot Boru, and Soreen Draa have fallen due to one issue or another.
---
Actually Thaumanova is just a reactor, but it shows pretty good, that their bigger labs mostly also are their settlements. They don't go home after work, they live there. 
---
&gt;Every other place is just a lab, and half of those get destroyed by the asura's own inventions
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inquest#Known_bases
---
Most of them *are* bases and not only labs. 
---
&gt;Tanks, submarines, and choppers are used throughout Orr. A single charr tank stops the mordrem migration in the Scar meta of TD.
---
Tbh it was just a small path which needed nothing more than a few shots. 
---
&gt;We seldom see power suits or golems being used by the Pact, in all honesty.
---
But we see lasers and airships pretty often. Also Golems mainly aren't weapons, they are more like servants. However, if the golem is made for fight, it's very dangerous. Think of the Mark III Exterminator Golem in Bug in the System story. 
---
&gt;Energy shields are not infallible, laser weapons require precision targeting while missile bombardment doesn't
---
No they are not infallible, but they are a very big advantage. Laser weapons require precision targeting, yes, but the Asura are able to do that. And if you think of standard power suit attacks, the Asura also have explosive weapons. 
---
For the Golems I can't agree, those things mostly happend in story mode and within experiments. Non experimantal golems are reliable.
---
Thanks. I have no idea how I didn't think of that.
---
The Krytan Shield makes a great standard silver shield, though may be a bit larger then what you're looking for.
---
I wouldnt delete any character. If possible, its almost always better to farm up some gold, convert to gems, and get a character expansion slot.
---
If your like challenge, go pay core necro. It's a real challenge to do anything without stability.
---
Ranger is my main. If you prefer excitement, try using a Greatsword with Axe/Warhorn. Actually Sword is more exciting but Axe is there for ranged attacks, for when you're forced out of melee range. 
---
I play all three meta builds for ranger at end game: Power Soulbeast, Condi Soulbeast and Boon Druid. They're all fun in their own way. 
---
Power Soulbeast is high risk high reward kinda bursty dps, condi is safe and easy for slower but sustained dps while Boon Druid can carry a party hard when played well. 
---
Alternatively, try playing a Guardian. It's an versatile class relying on active defenses (aegis) for survival. As a bonus, Guardian is meta in all game modes at end game, including competitive ones like PvP and WvW. Even a Core Guard can still hold its own among elite specs!
---
0/10 no prosthetic

Obligatory Shia LaBeouf alternative:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE

Not sure how its handled in Logitech, but it should be something simple like:

Space down

"V" down (or whatever you use as your dodge key)
---
Space up
---
"V" up
---
He's saying that Cantha (where Factions takes place) is the least present of the areas the game explores in GW2, while the regions in Prophcies and Nightfall are explored far more in GW2, which is actually true.
---
Because if you play for free, you have eight. Which is more than seven. If you pay to play, you have access to nine. Which is conveniently *also* more than seven. And "more than seven" sounds more appealing to the consumer than "eight" or "nine". "More than ____ " can be pretty powerful if wielded correctly, which is why you always see it.
---
No no, it really is mega-battlesand. It's stronger than regular battlesand.
---
Then the commander comes in and somehow saves him and turns him to good.
---
Thank you :)
---
I am kind of thinking that ArenaNet might change the model and stick to paid living seasons going forward. I.e; Heart of Thorns had Season 3 for free, Path of Fire had Season 4 for free.  Season 5 could be expansion level content given over a period of time, make it 30-40$.  I want this because I don't want to wait a year and a half to get new elite specs
---
&gt; Actually Thaumanova is just a reactor, [...]
---
Incorrect. If you talk to the NPC at the "front" doorway (east side), he explains that Thaumanova was a city. The city had a reactor underground in the giant Inquest lab, but it was far more than "just a reactor". It was a full blown city.
---
&gt; Most of them are bases and not only labs.
---
So? They're not *settlements* or *colonies*. They're labs and bases, the sci-fi equivalent to forts.
---
&gt; Tbh it was just a small path which needed nothing more than a few shots.
---
And a few hundred mordrem to be shot down.
---
&gt; But we see lasers and airships pretty often. Also Golems mainly aren't weapons, they are more like servants. However, if the golem is made for fight, it's very dangerous. Think of the Mark III Exterminator Golem in Bug in the System story.
---
Lasers... arguable. Airships, they're based off of charr tech that got modified by humans and asura (and for the larger ones, sylvari).
---
Your point on golems mainly being servants really only furthers my point. Though it's arguable about the whole "if the golem is made for fight, it's very dangerous". I mean, sure, some are, but not really most. There's really only two golem models that have proven repeatedly challenging - the siege golem and the very recent Inquest-exclusive exterminator golem that you mention.
---
&gt; No they are not infallible, but they are a very big advantage. Laser weapons require precision targeting, yes, but the Asura are able to do that. And if you think of standard power suit attacks, the Asura also have explosive weapons.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; For the Golems I can't agree, those things mostly happend in story mode and within experiments. Non experimantal golems are reliable.
---
Precision targeting means that you're only able to attack a handful of targets at a time, only a small cluster tops.
---
Non-experimental golems go haywire in about a dozen events throughout Metrica Province alone. You can probably take that x5 that in core maps overall.
---
Hey, thanks for replying and for the advice! [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/62998/reaper-was-weak-already-before-and-you-ruined-it-farther-pvp-ok-but-pve-totally-useless](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/62998/reaper-was-weak-already-before-and-you-ruined-it-farther-pvp-ok-but-pve-totally-useless)   From this link, it says reapers are in a bad spot, is this still the case?
---
It's a WvW thing where getting to a place faster or outpacing your enemy is worth it.
---
Pearl Shell is close but its not long and skinny enough and is too busy. The others are heater shields pretty much, though some are great and I do use them.
---
Each living story is a permanent unlock for your account. Once you have the episode, you have it forever and all the content with it, even if you don't start playing it for years.
---
The only thing that is a limited time right now is the episode being free. Just grab it now and you're good to go whenever you might want to do it.
---
There's no doubt in my mind there is an expansion planned. I just hope they take the lessons they learned from PoF to heart (particularly in reward acquisition and Meta Event engagement, which is perfect in HoT post-patches).
---
* Financially it makes a lot of sense. Expansions have historically brought the most sales in since the release of the game, especially compared to the Living Story releases. GW2 is not NCSoft's biggest earner, but it is somewhere around the middle.
---
* With the recent layoffs of (mostly) non-development teams and the cancellation of the new side projects, it definitely seems like GW2 has been made the renewed focus of ArenaNet. NCSoft knows they cannot rely on the development team to push out side project releases within an acceptable timeframe, but they also know that they can push out an expansion that will bring in a considerable amount of profit.
---
* The game cannot subsist on Living Story releases alone, which ArenaNet has full awareness of, as they have the financial data to show it. I believe the plan was to always have more expansions, but because they wanted to focus on side projects they were putting the next expansion on slower development. I don't buy for a second there wasn't some sort of planning or content development by a side team on expansion content because it would have been a major bad move on their part. 
---
* Simply closing GW2 and removing ArenaNet is a possibility given NCSoft's history, but not a very likely one. Other MMORPGs would come first, for one thing, but for another: they're still making a hefty chunk of profits from the games they own. Yes, they make a significantly larger portion through Mobile Game development, but closing down any MMORPGs they own would not provide more money to their Mobile Game properties. It would only decrease their overall profits. They only stand to lose.
---
Something with a pattern like Kryta's Embrace but a form like a longer skinnier Pearl Shell would be super.
---
It’s definitely alive and active, but i’ve also noticed that ANet avoids spilling specific numbers about playercount in infographics like these
---
Is each story a separate price? Even if I paid for the game at launch and have the expansions? May not be a deal breaker, just haven't paid much attention to them in the past.
---
The reward track on wintersday gives lots of gifts, the deeper into the reward track, the more gifts you get. You also get lots of karma from karma potions which are awarded at certain points in the track. You can actually check out what the track has if you head over the PvP icon and search the rewards tracks, it is in one of the tabs, cant remember, but seasonal reward tracks are kept in there, mouse over them and see each individual breaking point. Every year I make a **LOT** of gold just selling those gifts, the karma is just a nice bonus, but you can also convert that karma to gold, although I dont care much about it, and usually save it for some legendaries or whatever Anet might come up in the future. Cant never have too much of a currency with them.
---
Why has no one noticed the asura holding an actual phone?! This had to be for a Guild War mobile game.
---
Climb up the moutain till you get the open of 2 warps with a Smiley and a Frownie. If you actually look around (360 degrees) from that platform you will see Gourdon on a small peak of his own.
---
When will this scarf be back in the storw
---
This is not what I expected when I woke up to the WP video notification.
---
That said, I think it's a really good trailer for the length it is. It might seem a bit weird for us established players for various reasons (among them that there's only like 2 proper living giant wyvern in the game and they're not really iconic enemies and that it prominently shows off a birthday reward skin a new player won't get until 5? years in) but it shows off actual game skins really well and I think it really captures that feeling new players get at world bosses.
---
&gt; The only thing raiding needs is either a easier 10 man or a 5 man version.
---
I've been saying this for *years* at this point, but what GW2 raids need is CMs that provide incentives for players to want to do them and to enable fights to become an actual challenge. Most raid CMs in this game do very little to change the dynamics of the fight, and ultimately the CMs aren't that much more difficult than the normal fight. Not only that, but there's no reason to run a CM more than once.
---
If CMs in raids could introduce completely new and challenging mechanics in addition to providing a legitimate DPS check, normal boss difficulty could be scaled downwards as well (as well as rewards to compensate for the easy difficulty). This way, casual players could participate in the normal mode raid encounters and still experience the story and earn some rewards while those seeking challenges greater than ever before in GW2 could run CMs for the challenge in addition to the CM-exclusive titles and rewards.
---
The reason Anet has been so against this is because they have specifically said that they do not want to "split" the community. Unfortunately, if you want to create raids challenging enough to keep your hardcore playerbase happy as well as accessible enough for all players, you are going to have to split it to some degree. Most dedicated raiders will want to do the CMs exclusively, but if we want to have the best of both worlds there will have to be some kind of split imo. Making raids 5man doesn't solve this issue as 5-man raids completely invalidates Fractals of the Mists and we don't need another dungeon situation.
---
Raids need to become more accessible. Raids becoming more accessible means that Challenge Motes can actually become a challenge, and this way everyone would be happy.
---
Alright I was worried when you said live action ad (remembering the launch one) but this one's funny!
---
Hey, have someone noticed the "explosive second HALF of Season Four" line? LWS4 10 episodes confirmed?
---
Welcome Back to Guild Wars 2: Week 21
---
It's been awhile, but I remember running either this or traveler on my thief in WvW, it gives you an edge with strafing blind builds using mid range weapoms.
---
If you mostly want to heal in raids and dungeons, then ESO is probably the way to go. GW2's main focus is on neither and there is no true healing class (and yes, I include all current healing specs in the game). I love GW2, but I really miss healing.
---
I think you may be right. In Z’s letter he hinted that something would be coming between now and Ep6. Seems we may get some sort of current event update ahead of the release, but I’d love to see the episode at the end of the month.
---
Yeah it just uses the same base form, just like those small Forged creatures aren't actual devourers. It's easier and quicker to create new creatures this way and frees up time for the completely new creatures like hydras or Vlast in Path of Fire.
---
I'd rather not go to Cantha again, so many other places I am way more excited to see and discover.  
---
I would also rather see Anet do "mini" expansions as the first/last episode of each season, realeasing something like a half expansion so the game can maybe more fluently keep itself going without dry periods.   
---
But yeah as said, it seems more likely than not that we will get an expansion considering the recent layoffs (on other projects) due to lack of focus on the game.
---
i cant seem to find the phone you are talking about. but i also think this ad was originally for an mobile app. the timing the artstyle the overly shiny weapons.
---
I mean, 100% of all legendary greatswords are either part of or the result of the combination of two legendary GSs. There's not a songle legendary greatsword that doesn't follow this tradition.
---
World completion isn’t hard or difficult, I doesnt even take that much time I don’t get why people post about it
---
I would say that this was in the game since release
---
oh, I see.
---
Lots of research put there on it... from like a hundred metas ago...
---
ID and salvage
---
looks photoshopped
---
It’s aboit convenience. It’s very handy if you purchase additional shared inventory slots. You get a few one from consuming your instant-80 boost. 
---
If it hasn’t been mentioned, the 80 boost let’s you test classes in the Silverwastes (PVE
---
So you're telling me that you read the thread and came to the conclusion that pressing 1 button remapped to execute two key presses takes skill, and when pressing said button random output occurs it means that I am bad at pressing said button.
---
So tell me, are your parents siblings?
---
What ? We have minis to play with and our minis have other toys so they could play with it. Dont take away his toy =(
---
I didn't know that, so if you do a normal run you get extra baubles?
---
Can someone explain for a new player. What key to farm? Where? How?
---
These trailers are very on point. I like it.
---
I still remember the odd launch trailers, which at first depicted these poor people in horrible clay masks. (shudder). The new stuff has a certain focus and is short enough to be put on anything, really. So good work, marketing team.
---
To silence players who ask questions like this one
---
i think that they are still a thing, but not buyable, like collect all the maps "message in a bottle" log out back in, repeat.
---
i always assumed revenue included the associated cost
---
I had this in Tequatl  laughed until I died. My friend keep telling me I was gonna drown.
---
if a mesmer puts the Temporal Curtain on the left of where you are, they could potentially pull you up the ramp?
---
There's fun stuff with the gw2 physics engine plus pulls and ramps, usually seen due to revenant downed state 2 (Forceful Displacement) - if you stand with a curved ramp behind you when you get pushed, with a revenant at the bottom of the ramp, you can be shot up into the air.
---
here is my little nitpick there.
---
How about filling the place a bit more. The angles are nice, but it also feels barren. Like there is no life in a place that should be full of it.
---
Some quick insert players just walking around and other stuff, would make it more attractive.
---
because ???
---
But as u/Tiipi said you shouldn't worry much about them.
---
Wow you really are that ignorant. *slow clap*
---
I wish I could get similar results to most people but I'm actually getting noticeably lower FPS and that hasn't changed since the very first public version. We're talking about going from 40 FPS to 30 FPS in crowded situations and similar.
---
This sounds like the beginning of a bad joke but I just can't put it together.
---
could be just cut out of your screenshot.
---
Open all and runcrafter's salvege blue and green, silver'o'mat all rare and exo under 1 gold tp price
---
It's fine. 
---
I'm not a big fan of the *lowest common denominator lt's show them shiney lightsaber weapons* at the end, but if that's what marketing said will sell...
---
It just seems very tacky and not neccessary reflective of the game itself. Sure these weapons ar ein there, but that's overkill in my opinion.
---
They really clash with the rest of the trailer somehow. Feel SciFi and artifical in that big amount.
---
I mean, this is no Star Wars, but Guild Wars.
---
I can't argue with that
---
Aside from stats one very important part of the Support Scourge build is the rune and in training runs people are way more likely to go down so having something like a Rune of Mercy will improve greatly your impact on a kill by rezzing people faster and putting them back up with more health when they are the most vulnerable (because they probably don't have prot or regen anymore). And since it's a training and people will go down a lot [Sharpening Skulls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sharpening_Skull) are really great because who wouldn't want free stats (be careful that tanking is not decided by a margin lower than 75 toughness though :p)!
---
Then depending on the boss, if you don't want to spend too much money at the beginning on such a build I would recommend you go get a full set of Exotic Magi armor+trinkets from Karma vendors in Orr. On some bosses being able to use epidemic can help a lot deal with trash mobs so getting some more agressive stats (like Apothecary, Shaman or Marshal) while being careful about toughness can be worth it.
---
Imo, especially on a generic training you will want gear with mostly Healing Power as a main stat (on a 3-stat or 4-stat gear). Then Vitality because Vitality means more Shroud and more face tanking potential to help a group recover (you could for example, with a bit of barrier absorb the explosion of a Dhuum Bomb almost on you without going down and rez everybody). Then Condition Damage for when you wanna use your epidemic. Concentration is not very useful as you give very, very, very few boons.
---
Because of all that there is not exactly 1 best/right way to play heal Scourge as opposed to playing a specific DPS role for example so you mostly will need to try and figure stuff out as you go depending on the boss and the group.
---
Yep. You will get reward for Trib and then you will get reward for normal run when you finish it. Would be nice to get all the rewards in the first run .
---
As someone who doesn't understand this can someone do an ELI5 for me please?
---
Suffers the same Problem as the Grove.
---
The chosen frames, which should be buzzing with people feel empty and not attractive.
---
The Bar could have some players doing stuff there (like using the drinking challenge thing and have some cheer).
---
The streets could have people run by.
---
I know it's just a few seconds, but they don't sell it as much.
---
It's also interesting that the centerpiece of the city isn't shown.
---
That's so far the best, as the scenes show at least some *life*, aka some NPCs and interesting angles.
---
I like that one and the voice is fitting.
---
Why does this remind me of that old Leavenworth commercial?
---
Now your discord bot can tell you which worldboss you have not killed today
---
Is there a practice golem for bog skales? There should be one.
---
This along with all the videos /u/AnetHoGM posted is exactly what Anet needs to do.  These are much better than the LW videos because it shows off the game.  New players and those that haven't played in a while have no idea whats going on with LW story/lore.  Show them dragons and end-game content!
---
Hmm... and ? Some explenation why you are posting it ? Because it looks beautiful or is there something we should be looking for? o\_O
---
using the runecrafters SOM on identified blue gear would be a waste of salvage costs since blue gear doesnt have any upgrades slotted.
---
You'll be losing your time, then.
---
No the indifference in the droprate of symbols between blue and green is so low that it is reasonable to use runecrafters for both
---
Basically the api lets you request data about you game's account. They are adding more info that you can check, like world bosses in this case.
---
will the SAB weekly NPC stick around after SAB is gone?
---
You have several full maps on a daily basis, how do you think you dont have blobs? 
---
Unless you mean blobs worth fighting. In that case, yeah you dont.
---
Is the soundtrack from the cinematic something new or existing?
---
I never published my screenshot until now. 
---
So yes, I can guarantee you that OPs image is not cut out of mine. 
---
Your argument that it "looks the same" is because it's the same game. Ofcours it looks the same, why should Anet use different fonts for the same thing... 
---
Sorry, but that's hilarious. xD
---
I believe it's actually the opposite of "heavy tech", more like a mind trick. No technology to make smoothly moving platforms with players on them? Just move everything else.
---
The first instance of moving platform was introduced in HoT (the final story mission I think) but it was super wonky, I think the boat in S4E2 was the first instance of a 'true' moving platform.
---
Woah, you're right. Damn, I wated a lot the last few weeks
---
Then just .... don't watch trailers when you're still expecting to play past episodes ? How is that hard ?
---
Well the same you can say about John Williams. While his work is great in previous century... nowadays he just do bland iteration of his previous work.
---
That's a quality Update. Thanks!
---
Where is that? Never seen this place before...
---
The low lvl bag openers haven't changed, as bags that gave you lvl 50 gear before, will still give you normal lvl 50 gear now. 
---
Unids only replaced lvl 80 gear, if you id them, they will give you lvl 80 gear no matter which lvl the opener has.
---
I play a non meta weaver build.
---
The meta is full marauders, but I play 50% zerk. 
---
Other than that, I play mostly meta because I'm not a freeloading, shit tier, snowflake who demands I be able to play how I like at the expense of the rest of the team.
---
A fractal worthy story to be told.
---
Considering they are also outside of SAB and the 2 other nearby NPCs are now staying all year long I think so yes.
---
Damn, NA gets all the cool things, Full HOT completion and now this? Blasphemy!
---
Looks like from 2011, but better than no campaign at all.
---
Been seeing a Finn the Human (from adventure time) warrior running around, I love it.
---
He has the saint bernard Jackal skin and dyes it all yellow too so he's riding around on Jake the Dog! Best outfit I've ever seen.
---
\*Cattlepult
---
You can buy sab trib runs, at least in EU lfg is always filled with those. Or if u have a skilled friend he can carry you through. Your definition of agility is very broad. Do you consider raids fractals and pvp to be agility based ? Besides pvp and sab trib, maybe raids cms and fractal cms, everything in this game has a pretty low skill cap. Stupidily low in fact.
---
Am I taking crazy pills here, or are we completely ignoring Firebrand? You know, the crazy support healer that has undergone massive nerfs since its release because of how amazing it is?
---
1. Absorbing a portion of your allies damage into yourself (Bulwark Gyro)  
---
-Guardian does this with its own style by providing massive amounts of aegis.  
---
2. Sharing a portion of your heals with your allies (Medical Dispersion Field)  
---
-FB provides raw, massive AoE healing  
---
3. Ungodly levels of health regen (Rapid Regeneration)  
---
-FB also provides massive regen  
---
4. Ungodly amounts of barrier spam  
---
-FB doesn't use barrier, but it does use aegis, which is a form of a barrier. It's amazing, because you can time when you give it to block some massive hits both in wvw and in fractals.  
---
5. Easy access to group wide Stability, Protection, Condi Cleanses, CC's, and now even reflects  
---
-FB literally does all of this handedly.
---
But why did you crop it like this? Not necessarily doubting that it's legit but it's unnecessarily suspicious.
---
screenshot? cant find the phone
---
Problem is getting the weapons, im already done with the armor hence it was so cheap.
---
Doesn't look like gw2 really.
---
Wtf
---
Not everyone started the game in 2012. For a newer/returning player it's probably a lot. 
---
I quit when 10k was a lot. Came back and people have 39,000.
---
&gt; Found the unlisted one on youtube
---
How do you exactly find an unlisted video lol
---
I would wait for useful stuff when there is a sale of it.
---
So inventory slot expansions, bank expansions,... etc.
---
Stuff that matters.
---
World completion really isn’t that hard or long to do. Just depends on if u want to do it. I completed it very early on. But I have friends I play with, who have never done it. Also I did it without mounts or gliding. It’s so easy to accomplish with gliding and mounts.
---
The worst part is that OP has posts dating back over a year on this subreddit. Pathetic.
---
Arms not lanky enough
---
I completed a few months ago and didn't post anywhere. I'm almost completing with another character already.
---
It becomes a grind for gold. Everyone will end up doing silverwastes eventually. You could very leisurely build all your stuff but there’s timegates on all ascended items and for end game you should have more than 1 class. It was different for me because I started raiding very shortly after getting my first character to 80 and I raided on every class. I guess most people will take way longer to start raiding and therefore have a lot of gold/pieces from stuff like world bosses and fractals.
---
at 1080p in LA at max settings: 6,7GB RAM and 2.5GB VRAM
---
Driver memory manager unloads unused objects when it hits near 100% usage, like 1,9Gb. Giving a fake look of "my VRAM is not used 100% and it's fine" but in fact "my VRAM is used 100% and driver trying to swap out not used things"
---
I don't want a 3rd expansion so the game can finally die and I no longer have an excuse to face reality^^^I will probably swith to FFXIV though and deny reality
---
Probably would. With the springer and Bond of faith someone will find a was. Anet fixes it and a new was will be found. 
---
Maybe they considered the idea of mounts in the early raids but the work they have to do for it outweighs the benefits.
---
Am I the only one that saw a sun with a mustache on that thumbnail?
---
Tho only now I'm seeing, I'm really new to this place and just noticed the karma system and boy oh boy there are some speshal snowflakes in here. -7 for stating fact, eyy eyy holy kek
---
How the hell do you "farm" keys?
---
WTF?
---
Surely they mean, gold farmers? So they convert gold into 125 gems and buy keys.
---
No, they're not. Just check the wiki.
---
If those bag thingies you mean are https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Gear, they still drop gear according to your char lvl.
---
&gt; Living world spans 37 episodes across **4 seasons**
---
Is it though? Most players would probably say the game has only had 3 seasons for most of its life :P
---
*OwO, what's this?* It's your **7th Cakeday** Sejsel! ^(hug)
---
less than 2 gold? what do you spend your money on? :o
---
Build the Ascalonian wall and make Charrs pay for it.
---
Twat
---
In addition  to bbjimin's comment, you don't actually need ascended armour for the vast majority of content. (Everything aside of high-lvl fractals and raids.) Exotic is enough for the vast majority of game content, and you can get a full set of exotic gear for 10-20 gold.
---
Jerk
---
And why excactly should make this post then? 
---
You assuming OP for lying and swindling with no prove, no hint, not even the smallest clue. 
---
You assuming a person to be a liar and cheater because "he could do that"! 
---
That's paltry, just paltry.
---
Then you just proved my point and went against your own statement. Don’t need to talk shit pretending it’s advice because you hate Gandara.
---
You can distinguish the bot pretty easily:
---
* Using same predefined paths. Usually some of them don't use closest paths but run a bit around, or always go around home node, always pathfinding goes to the node and only if other nodes are enemy capped and no fight there, they continue to the next node.
---
* if you own all 3 nodes, some bots just wait on their last node and afk as they don't have another target
---
* if you stealth, bot never cleaves and instantly switches target/runs away
---
* sometimes bots are stuck in some path loop
---
* usually it's mirage, but also seen minionmancer necro or even guardian.
---
If you play at nights, you have pretty huge chance for them to be there, as queues are otherwise dead. They can be outplayed by some tricks like stealth, but otherwise most of them are not really that bad and can put a solid fight, especially if you run something that has no counterplay to mirages. The problem is that they won't react to chat or custom objectives/situations.
---
My personal opinion is that those are made by Anet as some of the "hidden projects" , either for using AI or as a queue filler for when there is not so many players. Getting AI capable of botting such pvp gameplay on good level would be pretty solid accomplishement, and they are not banning them, those bots just get better over time....it's a bit of conspiracy though :) Just imagine if they could run some neuron network AI and test the balance to some degree by thousands of simulated matches before testing it with people....that would have been a dream xD
---
I dont get your point?
---
Id rather boost the core maps and make the experience more enjoyable for new players so most of the f2p stay and buy the game. I find a bit boring getting a bit of the story every 10 levels and the heart somewhat boring. Plus story telling is not good. Things get better on HoT really good ideas I wish they implement new metas in the core maps
---
&gt; And why excactly should make this post then? 
---
Gotta live up to the name.

Alright, who're the ones getting killed by Bog Skales? Own up to it!

---
The public perception of this sub regarding wvw really boggles my mind. You think there are shared accounts played by actual pvpers nearly 24/7 for wintrading at 1300 rating?
---
Why play 24/7 to wintrade? I mean most wintraders were known to abuse off hours, why grind other silvers on prime? Why grind literally permanently? 
---
Why sandbag to 1300 rating? Most wintrading occurs between high rated accounts. Allows them to snipe eachother accounts during off hours easily. This account wouldn't even get into top games. And while I'm sure everyone on reddit would be legendary if they just tried, the people caught wintrading were far, far above 1300. 
---
Can you tell me why you think it's probably not a bot, yet almost certainly used for leaderboard scamming? Because other than confirming the biases of this sub, theres zero reason to account share and grind games 24/7 at 1300 rating, if your goal is to boost people up to 1700+. But theres great evidence towards bots farming low elo for gold 24/7.
---
You are so dumb its actually amazing. He is obviously baiting/trolling/being sarcastic....
---
you can try to email them explaining the situation, if they think its appropriate they will give you gems back. Try it out! :)
---
Since when does a full raid take 1-1.5 hours?

Also, 1/20 fractal gods I see dont do good dps
---
&gt; And why excactly should make this post then?
---
Even if the SS was genuine, thats a good question because its quite a low effort post. If OP was somewhat proud of their own achievement, they could have provided some context about their journey towards 10k, show their main characters or talk about their favourite content in game. There is absolutely no relation between the picture and OP visible.
---
&gt; You assuming OP for lying and swindling with no prove, no hint, not even the smallest clue.
---
I am not assuming anything, I just stated that due to the low effort and quality of the post, it could be photoshopped or just a copy/paste from another image on the internet. Since OP provides no other evidence, everybody has to judge that on their own.
---
&gt; You assuming a person to be a liar and cheater because "he could do that"!
---
&gt; That's paltry, just paltry.
---
I never called anybody a liar or cheater, i just discussed the quality and origin of the screenshot.
---
There is supporting (Giving them boons and so on) and healing. If you want to be healing then firebrand is probably the best one followed by tempest and then druid. If you want to support them then Druid might be on the first stop still follower with firebrand. But again there are many other classes wich can be buffing your friends . I have all of them (hope I do) and Im choosing wich one of them would be better on diferent situations. Most of the time Im on my Firebrand wich feels can do anything but few times when Im teaching new players wich can dodge, I would take my ele with Rebound to keep them alive from time to time. Again it depends on your situation and your point of view what might or might not be better and I bet a lot of people now will be yelling at me that what Im doing is stupid. Like everytime here on reddit but if you are interested then you can take a look on my [builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:DiegoDeLaHouska).
---
I'd love to jump back in and do the Living World stuff, but honestly, with the amount of episodes I've missed, it's going to cost somthing like £100
---
You can easily grab anything that's on youtube for your personal and off-line use. Just google it.
---
Someone know if it can show Account Luck after 472510 luck once you hit 300 mf aswell?
---
Yeah, it really has the vibe of a generic asian mobile game that rips off assets from GW2.
---
I never got into the Battle Royale craze but the EBG Battle Royale thing from the April Fools patch notes kinda made me think "Yea that would be fun"
---
Try it if you want to use 2000 gems insted of few silver to finish it yourself.
---
You will have to enter each map to get the rewards. Same goes for HoT/PoF maps if you unlock the hero points through WvW.
---
for normal pve you don't need full support and you should care about damage, else stuff can really get to be a pain. killing some enemy in 5 mins when it can take 20 seconds is really not nice. especially when you start out in dungeons / fractals at some point it can get tiring if you got some full "support" which does basically nothing.  
---
a druid can carry and has really nice buffs, but it also will introduce you to one thing: you will start to facetank stuff instead of learning the game and how to use active defenses and that will just end in bad behaviour where you start to struggle yourself at some point.  
---
that being said, firebrand is a really good choice in terms of support.  
---
especially the condition variant:  
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/  
---
is really valuable. it does good damage while giving permanent quickness and quite a bit of might. also has additional condicleanses, reflect and cc over tomes.  
---
sure, condition damage is not the very best for high end fractals &amp; dungeons, but for now this is one build i would advise you to go for, if you want to support.
---
Sir, go and do PvE, please.
---
WvW had enough damage from neglect, mounts and gliding. It still have problem of matchmaking and unnecessary queues (hello no Alliance update). And elephant in the room - Scourge with current meta.
---
Real content for WvW is:
---
- Remove foking roots from desert borderland
---
- Delete every single PvE mob from gamode
---
- Delete AC
---
- Delete Scourge as main damage dealer
---
- Fix air keep and dozen other glitching exploits
---
You can hit me up. Ill post my in game tag when I get home
---
KD this week is Gandara 1.65, FS 0.95 and the French at 0.5.
---
Shit roamers are so easy to take down, I can take most roamers down on zerg builds. You guys should be way ahead in KD is we have so much trash running around. Coverage doesn't represent KD at all.
---
That market is hyper-saturated, and NC Soft themselves already have games competing in there. They might just not have seen any potential in this that warranted the investment.
---
lol these are great xD
---
&gt;WvW had enough damage from neglect,
---
So it's neglected but anything changing is bad? Right...
---
What you mentioned has nothing to do with balance, it's l2p issues. I was thinking about better class distribution among whole game. Ranger has no use in bigger fights, necro is a walking loot bag in solo roaming. Some classes are taken in zergs for 1-2 utility skills while the rest is useless etc.
---
A climbing mount. Rip Springer it was nice with you.
---
Countdown till Aurene skin. :P
---
Druid provides great might uptime and has unique dmg buffs like spirits and spotter. However it is a mediocre healer compared to FB.
---
FB provides decent might uptime, aegis, stability and also quickness, a buff which is rather hard to come by usually. It also has a ton of heal. 
---
I personally run a Minstrel FB for fractals, it is great to keep people alive and allows to ignore a lot of mechanics or heal mistakes that would otherwise wipe us.
---
I find blobs from other servers are far more likely to quit on us than we do ourselves. Other servers think so little of Gnadara they quit after losing one or two blob fights.
---
Our issue with population is that sometimes it can be hard to maintain a good fighting blob because the map will quickly get a queue with 10-15 people following the blob without joining squad. So we are usually stuck with what we have. But when it does work, it really does work. There are more than enough nights where I am in a blob and we are winning every fight. WvWintel KD ratio this week shows that a lot off.
---
It's probably not live for a few hours yet.
---
Would’ve prefered a two seater mount so you can take a friend with you who doesn’t have the xpacs. This seems pretty unecessary seeing we can already reach high altitudes with the springer, jump of and instantly switch to griffon while mid air.
---
I feel like they should show different clips of the game and not the same for all
---
The annoying thing is going into WvW and coming back out- the default mount bind stays on warclaw. I usually have it on griffon so I’ve jumped off a few cliffs thinking I’ll just zoom along lol
---
I don't have enough keys on my keyboard for this. :o
---
I already told you. It's not what WvW needs. There are other priorities. Why bring PvE stuff to WvW, when we have PvE for that?
---
I think it might be needed for the story, so anet has made it easier to obtain flying mount rather than force people to get the griffon/rent griffon
---
&gt; Aha, okay... sure...
---
so you finally agree.
---
1. Vastly improved class balance. Get rid of projectile reflects or nerf them severely (frontal cone only, limited absorption, vastly increased cooldowns - 3-4 players should never be able to provide 50 teammates with complete immunity to projectiles at all times. By the way, why have they nerfed the number of targets on Ele mass CC skills yet left unlimited absorption for projectile blocks? Makes no sense, these are very similar effects that should be treated similarly). Nerf ridiculous condition cleanse spam. Ideally they should also rethink boons and conditions at large, make changes to combo system, remove AOE skill caps and much more, but I doubt they are willing to make any core gameplay changes specifically for WvW.   
---
2. Make changes in the direction of the game mode being more permanent.   
---
3. The maps should be much larger with a greater variety of objectives, mounts should be much faster to compensate. Replace the second alpine borderlands with a new unique map (that isn't specifically made to be a PITA to navigate, looking at you desert).    
---
4. Rethink tower/castle siege gameplay, larger scale objective fights should be more structured with more clear roles to play, something similar to Planetside (1). 
---
5. Introduce a greater variety of vehicles/vehicle mounts with a greater variety of combat roles that would diversify the siege supply economy. 
---
What we definitely don't need is adding more PVE elements to WvW. Not with the mode suffering from being slapped onto the generic GW2 game and tied to its economy.
---
Huh. As an actual, open world mount?
---
Seems to be infringing on the springer's territory. Not sure how I feel about that. So far, all mounts have been filling a niche. But that one feels a bit like one too many. The warclaw works, because it's a WvW mount. And that? A zone-specific one?
---
I'm cautiously curious.
---
&gt; There are other priorities.
---
Like what? If you even suggest "Needs more players" im gonna slam my head against a wall
---
But also there is still a niche for every mount. As long as they keep these niche, I'm fine with it.
---
That would be a complex system for them to build into the game with very little benefit.
---
I told you already. Read again my first comment if you forgot.
---
I seem to have that happen inconsistently. I should test it, but I \*think\* if you go to character select and come back in, you will leave WvW without retaining the warclaw. I definitely know that it does not survive swapping to a different character.
---
It should had been the first flying mount, I mean it's the freaking logo :P Not a fan for being the next mount. I would rather have an underwater mount but hey I still want that dragon :D
---
It makes the Springer obsolete.
---
Must admit I'm slightly dissapointed with the animations. Seems like they didn't put in as much work as with griffon for example, a lot of stiffness.   
---
Unrelated but we could theoretically gain altitude with this bad boy, use the special skill to dismount and mount griffon mid air for the speed? Hype
---
Killing lords serves as a time barrier to encourage fights by contesting for control of an objective. The content is not the lord, it is the players you have to fight so you have the time to kill the lord and cap the objective. Randomly adding bosses or npc's is not content, and if not done carefully it might mess up alot of things on the wvw map. 
---
If you want to make a suggestion to add content to wvw maps you need to keep in mind that you add them with the idea to encourage two factions to fight over it, so it makes fully use of the unique aspects of WvW. PvE is not the content, the players are.
---
GW2 Radial
---
So it looks like a griffon, flies like a griffon, uses the same rig as the griffon...
---
I already have a griffon.
---
yea but its ~~sh~~ not good
---
I don't even have the first!
---
Here we can see the target audience.
---
Now I don’t know much about programming but wouldn’t it be the same principle as someone entering your car in GTA Online? 
---
RIP Springer...
---
No spider mount :(
---
Think maps in the sky, aerial story sections that require you to fly to different places both vertical and horizontal. Nothing else filled that niche until now. It's pretty nice. Griffon for horizontal aerial travel, skyscale for vertical aerial travel. Raptor for horizontal ground travel, springer for vertical ground travel. Jackal for tight turns and evading mobs. Skimmer for water travel. Beetle for high risk high reward racing.
---
There's natural overlap, but they all fill their own niche.
---
I mean, Path of Fire isn't the peak of litterature, to me :x
---
&gt; WvW needs balance, fixes, alliances...
---
What this? Wow, informative, all 3 are already happening, 2 of them on a biweekly basis. 
---
So basically you have no clue what it needs besides whats been happening since launch. 
---
FFS no wonder Anet have no clue how to improve the mode because the players have absolutely no damn clue either but scream the damn same thing every day anyway.
---
I don’t really think there’s too much overlap with the mounts we have. Raptor is for fast, short distance travel, bunny is super high jumps, skimmer is for water/quicksand/lava travel. Sand jackal is for navigating stairs/ tricky areas with tight fits. Griffin is for speed, and so is roller beetle. Now we got our dragon to fly us up more vertically. The only overlapping I feel currently is now with this dragon and our bunny, since it gains vertical lift and can fly away if you don’t make the jump
---
I've only got so many keys I can assign :p
---
How can you be? I use the profession skills around WASD on QEZX, shift+S for heal, shift+QEZX for respective toolbelt skills, ctrl+QEFZXCVB for mounts. Still have full set of easy hotkeys for ctrl+shift combos!
---
They are probably going to implement some sort of radial menu for mounts as well.
---
Yayyy, more mount skins in the gem shop.
---
Raptor is still really useful for quickly traversing medium distances. Beetle can be too awkward in some terrain.
---
GTA online had good reason for such a system to exist in their engine, it’s worth the coding time to create it. 
---
It’s also pretty different as mounts aren’t unique objects but a change in state of the player character. They’d have to rebuild the system to allow you to map a different player to your movement, disable their ability to move and allow it to be cleanly disengaged without any issues. It’s absolutely doable but it’s effort that would be spent for no real benefit. There is no gameplay reason for having players be a passenger on another’s mount.
---
&gt; Which is even better than colonies in a war, not?
---
&gt; My original point wasn't about "they have cities/colonies everywhere", it was about "they are everywhere". The Inquest is present everywhere in Tyria, if their bases are labs, colonies or settlements doesn't really matter, they are present in large numbers.
---
This doesn't add much compared to the existence of waypoints that allow them to go to a lot of places, especially Ascalon, quickly. Far more places than their literally one base in Ascalon.
---
So I don't see this as a benefit.
---
&gt; Yeah, but in the case of a war, ofcourse the Asura would build War-Golems. Sure, it would take a while, so it wouldn't be their first attack, but they would come in later waves.
---
&gt; Also there are several other technologies, which would bring great advantages in case of a war. Teleport without reciever for example. Think of how we went to Kourna with a whole armee, even with a prototype.
---
That army had to show up in small numbers; the charr would be capable of locating and bombarding the area before the asura could get a sizeable army through if it's anywhere near their forces, and if it isn't, then it isn't a worthwhile troop movement. And resulted in a dangerous and permanent rift to boot, which most people would avoid doing more than once.
---
&gt; Well, if you think of the megalaser, those small clusters aren't that small.
---
I was thinking of a megalaser, actually. For example, the airship laser bombardment during Battle for LA event. That was a small cluster that would hit ~10 folks tops, if they were completely balled up (and not clipping through each other).
---
&gt; But again, that's standard golems.
---
And non-standard golems go haywire more frequently. Your point?
---
At the very end, the charr on the (our) far left has his mouth stuck open when he joins the crowd and then shouts.
---
Hum, I'll try that.
---
&gt;  Randomly adding bosses or npc's is not content,
---
unless you replace the lord with them, y'know attacking the castle and needing to fight a dragon or something would be pretty awesome...considering the Desert has a fire area.
---
im not saying just shove them randomly somewhere.
---
Still a lot of effort for something that isn’t really adding anything worthwhile to the game. If that was an issue they could much easily o-en up the warclaw requirements by removing the PoF ownership req. 
---
Even if they did add it for that reason you’d need to organise a buddy system in your squad so those people have a chance to get on before everyone goes off, it would slow down the squad more than needing stragglers to catch up.
---
Next a dolphin, seahorse or turtle for underwater, plz.
---
cant i just upgrade griffon? his skin was about 1000g XD
---
I can see an underwater mount, but I don't see multi-seat working. I mean, in order to use the multi-seat mount in WoW, you have to be in a group. Since one of GW2's philosophies seems to be playing together without having to group up, I don't see how you can keep just some random person from hitching a ride and not letting go when you wanted to give someone else a ride. Know what I mean?
---
GW1: Customize your character with skills, traits, gear enhancements, and professions to take on three campaigns and an expansion pack.
---
GW2: cAn YoU nAiL tHe BeSt LoOk?!
---
How about other animals that stick to the walls?
---
Centipede mount anybody?
---
Let me put it like this - you ever been interesting in a career as a Black Lion merchant?
---
What, no! Those guys have like a 2 minute lifesp... oh.
---
Not everyone wants/like to use shift/ctrl associated keybounds. It's tedious.
---
You’re a bit late on the post mate.
---
Lore-wise:
---
I hoped to fly with Aurene when Griffon came out.
---
Now she's dead and THEN we get the dragon flying mount. -_-
---
Multiseat would be a godsend.
---
Remember the spider fight in suns refuge? I read somewhere (very shady take this for a grain of salt) that it was the remains of their spider mount development. That being said, so long as this guy doesn’t go fast, I wouldn’t see it as a replacement for the griffin
---
&gt; Good that you finally agree.
---
With my own comment? Sure.
---
Just like you can speed much with the beetle. So many "if/when/but" that it's not really an advantage per se.
---
Maybe a slime mount? Stays away from insects and fills the niche of sticking to environments. I think they want to stay away from insectoid mounts considering there tends to be a decent amount of people scared of them in general.
---
no
---
Gandara ragequits near instantly except for Pure guildraids. In fact they got farmed by kiss out of t1 regardless of coverage lul.
---
As soon as you wipe twice, those 15 pugs and half your squad is gone. And when it works, it really works well? No shit if you win you get 60+ gankers pretending they're roaming with sick 1v1 skills.
---
You're currently fighting fsp and AR, complete trash. You also get comms from TLS which hugely boosted your kda. Which is funny because tls ragequit deso over getting hard farmed.
---
Being able to kill people without opposition doesn't mean you're good, and it definitely doesn't mean you'll ragequit and hide in towers as soon as better players show up. But better players know you do that, so they don't even bother.
---
Oh hell no. Comparing those two is like comparing your cat to a washing machine.
---
*whispers* ... but will I be able to skin it like Aurene?❤️ *runs and hides*
---
U are righhtttt
---
Ladies and gentlemen, here we have our new champion of "suggesting changes to something they are clueless about"
---
I'd strongly suggest to OP to keep posting, our meme bank needs a good top up
---
Keep in mind to buy a nice CPU, Gw2 is horrible about that. 
---
New CPU = +40 Frames for me,
---
New GPU (Gtx960 to Gtx1060) = +6 Frames (cried hard)
---
&gt; It’s absolutely doable but it’s effort that would be spent for no real benefit
---
Sounds like sitting on chairs to me.
---
Wanna recommend me a pc? Looking for one xD
---
WvW does not get balances on a biweekly basis... and alliances have like 2 people working on them. Here’s an idea. A sudden influx of players WONT help because it would just be like the warclaw, where a bunch of people come and go within a week. Rather than dedicating resources to whatever PvE nonsense you want in WvW, why not put more devs on alliances or balance patches? Maybe actually help the game mode? Once it’s fixed, then you can start talking flashy stuff to attract new players. The players do know what they’re talking about, seems like you don’t.
---
for example, you can lock your mount to only friends/group/guild?  
---
you can maybe "open" your mount with a keybind or whatever?
---
There is a lot of solution to fix the abuse frome players
---
When you don't even bother checking the fresh page to see that someone posted it 20 minutes earlier.
---
Because those last two things are the two worst issues in WvW, and based on your comments, you probably don’t play much of it
---
Easy way to solve the overlap: Skyscale has to wait build up energy like the Beetle, but can ultimately get to higher ground than the Springer.
---
The person that was banned was previously also banned for 1 week due to racism in /say chat.
---
He was not a 1 time offender. He was also recently banned a couple of days on his new account, again, racist slurs in /say chat.
---
Even his account name at the time was supposedly a racial slur against Filipinos.
---
But it kinda devalues the Griffon, doesn't it?
---
&gt; Think maps in the sky, aerial story sections that require you to fly
---
that would only work if the mount was available for everyone that might encounter those maps.  say you miss this release's window and don't unlock the episode, thus you don't have this mount.  
---
what then?
---
&gt;Waypoints are becoming redundant, it's true. And I think that could be a good thing.
---
in no way shape or form is that a good thing.
---
ooo can’t  wait
---
Check metabattle for builds on the conquest section and read all the traits. 
---
Also take unranked pvp with a grain of salt because the matchmaking is pretty bad. You could end up having a top 100 on the enemy tram and you will destroyed so dont let it dishearten you. When you are able rank you will get more balanced teams.
---
i prefer Raptor over Jackal in almost every situation.
---
Maybe 100 gold and a collection? Anet said the Griffon will stay the Prestige Mount.
---
Springer is best for when there are high ledges above you but no wall you can climb with the Skyscale. In that case, you just jump up from one to the other all the way to the top. 
---
The Skyscale will be best for scaling tall buildings
---
what? his account name is a tv mascot. you REALLY need to have facts before you say things like that.
---
Not if it can't also climb upside down, to go over ledges.
---
[You only need a single one](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Addons).
---
with my nearly 11k hrs I can relate to those spent years :DD
---
I didn't know I wanted a turtle mount. Thanks 😁
---
Possible but maybe there will be some balance about climbing speed, I'm gonna be on the side of "let's wait and see" as their implementation of mounts in PvE has been mostly great.
---
This. I thought I could just switch between it and the raptor by using the current mount button for both, but every time I come out of WvW the warclaw stays my current in PvE and I have to change it back to raptor.
---
As much as I appreciate a good shitpost, you're targeting the wrong part of pve. If you want a better reaction you need to swap raids with open world. Pretty sure that raiders would be thrilled to see something new in raids, anything really. 
---
Wvw may not need new content, but raids are in desperate need of such.
---
That's so weird. Other than the text itself, nothing in that video seems "GW2-y".
---
I welcome this change of strategy. I suppose NCSOFT taking over part of the publishing might have something to do with it.
---
Gaming mice and keyboards. And no finicky software "solutions" on top of perfectly functional games.
---
You have 0 clue. We have the same balance for years. How many balance patches have we had since then? Did they fix it? No. Fixes: There have been gliding exploits that still haven't been fixed. Alliances: Only 2 devs working on them, yet you still want dev power on useless things that will not improve WvW at all. 
---
&gt; the players have absolutely no damn clue
---
Yeah the people who actually PLAY WvW have no clue, but you do and you think that making WvW a PvE mode will make things better. Lmao. You suggestions are bad and you should feel bad.
---
No, the griffon is *fast*
---
Sitting on chairs actually uses the same code as the mounts, they didn‘t have to put in that much effort because of that.
---
PVE: Support really isn't needed, but if you have your heart set on making people better 
---
Firebrand is great, maybe I offer some alternatives?
---
Boon chrono makes everyone better. You won't need to heal because you are making your DPS so great things fall over before they damage you
---
Support Scourge: Unkillable healing monster  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY)  I use celestials in open world rather than Magis because I like to do a teeny bit of damage. It really shines in small group PVE content like HP runs with 3 people or even a 3-4 person bounty.
---
Vertical speed could be a balance, I will probably go on the "wait and see" team and hold more definitive comments until then since their implementation of mounts in PvE has been mostly good so far.
---
for example the druid rune.  
---
even a druid prefered monk runes over druid runes. then they buffed the monk rune to get even stronger.
---
but yeah some of them are already viable
---
I would love to see SAB + Raid together. SAB Trib mode would be excelet for challange modes in Raids. I dont mean that next story should be in SAB but that we already have a "Dev" in the game working on a game. Why not talk to him and pay him to program us a training raid in SAB environment. We should go to Moto and pay him to make us an easy raid with a difficutl between Fotm CM and Raids. A training raid wich would be in SaB so we would be getting  [Bauble Bubbles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bauble_Bubble) in that as well and whole year !
---
I want enough that it isn't about what the best mount over all it. I want it to become whatever mount you like the most of the the moment.
---
If you have the griffon...
---
Ok that would be awesome.
---
Can you chainload it with arcdps? How does it work in wvw?
---
I don't know. I mean we have Raptor, Jackal and Rollerbeetle as land travel mounts and still each of them have their niches. 
---
We couldn't see what exactly the new mount is able to do and what not. It could be much slower at climbing/lifting, so the Springer would still be better for "small" heights. For example those heights where you only need one Springer jump. 
---
If that's so, you still would use your springer to jump on things like normal, but you wouldn't have to play jumping puzzle to climp up a high wall and instead use the Skyscale.
---
[removed]
---
I'll wait forever on that spider mount.
---
Probably because it would be too game breaking. I am fine at how it is, still helps a lot.
---
I really enjoy most of the rune buffs, but the +10% max. hp some runes feels kinda  random
---
What the article says is that this mount won't go as fast, not even close.
---
We could say that the Griffon is the Beetle in the air, while this would be... well any other mount in the air I guess. Maybe because it can gain altitude, the Springer would be more comparable. However the article doesn't say anything about its actual speed.
---
I made a play list for all of the Tourism videos for everyone to just have 1 link to click.

Last Episode of the Season, my prediction is we gonna force Krakaltorik to crash land with serious injury, and while he's busy monologue about it is futile to end him, Primordus breach out from under him and devour him whole, Jaws Style and retreating back underground that lead to Third Expansion: Depths Of Tyria!  
---
Or same scenario but it's Bubble that gonna grab him from the Sky, and eventually lead to maps of unending ocean, underwater style.

---
Why does the lead designer Linsey Murdock talk about the intentional development of the mount as though it was mysteriously discovered somewhere in the game? How would a feature surprise the game designer responsible for supervising its development?
---
Or the walls it can grab are special walls much like the destructible beetle walls, which would render that aspect of the mount useless. (plz no)
---
Question for a mesmer : 
---
- Between condi mirage and power chrono, what do you run in open world ? I'm farming hp for my chrono spec right now, but I heard it's quite good.
---
- How is support chrono in fractal nowaday ?
---
Well there is a beauty in everything you can see. Its just point of a view. I just love to explore every corner .. every little stone and pebble. Looking if I couldnt find something o_O
---
do not understand
---
First one is a good point. I'm guessing there's a set piece we'll need the skyscale for during the next episode, after which it'll be handled much like the roller beetle - achievements and alternate routes available that can utilise it, without making it a strict requirement.
---
I'm going to have to disagree on waypoints. Traversing maps using mounts feels so much more natural than opening a map UI and clicking a button to teleport.
---
Birds in raids.
---
Aurene dragon skin incoming
---
&gt;!only if you personally skin Aurene corpse first!&lt;
---
She's dead, but so was Snaff and Eir and they appear again as Ghost. Maybe Aurene will accompany us against Krakaltorik as a Ghost, flying beside us.
---
Lets be real amount of condi cleanse and boon application exists only because of sizable Scourge condition application. No doubt both Scourge and Firebrand needs rethink. Fireblrand most strongest skill is tome 3-4 and it is THE only option for any sizable group fight to be able finish it in 1 minute and not after of 20 minute pirateship shadebomb fiesta.
---
Honestly my opinion is that actually Scourge need to be barrier support, not main arsenal of condi spam... desert, sand yata yata yata...
---
showing your ignorance again. pino is a charecter from seseme street. dont twist it to be something else.
---
The pressing question is, how long of an airtime will it have compared to griffon.
---
I knew it ! The warclaw was not the new mount they said !
---
Or a Lizard one. Too bad we already have a Gecko Springer skin.
---
Started playing 6 weeks ago, got world complwtion last week, have not posted it on reddit.
---
May be just a really large scale situation of what was happening in Jahai. I saw jungle parts and now I am happy.
---
Your ideas are so bad most people agree they are stupid, which is why the thread shifted from feedback to please stfu if you have no idea what you're on about.
---
W A N T
---
I also welcome this change of strategy. I am, however, hesitant of their marketing materials - the newer [teased ads](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bb6956/i_just_leave_these_here/) are, at best, mediocre and have multiple technical issues that definitely don't scream "hey, it's made by professionals, good money were spent, we're advertising an expensive product, so you're okay to invest your time in it".
---
It has always been 250g.  Each map has two 25g items you have to buy from heart vendors.  If you really REALLY want the griffon and have a hard time saving, I would suggest doing dailies every day (easy 2g - even doing nothing else, every 2 weeks you could buy an item) as well as whatever other content you enjoy (world bosses? mapping and gathering? dungeons/fractals?) and selling all the stuff you find each day. Once you have 25g, go buy one of the griffon items so you aren't tempted to spend the gold on anything else. Even if you did nothing but log in and do your dailies, you could have griffon in 4 months.
---
Agreed, and also tiresome for those of us with small hands.
---
Kinda, yeah.
---
&gt;Keep Construct now requires the use of Catapults to defeat.
---
Everyone knows that there's nothing challenging about scripted mobs. If raids were meant to be the most challenging content it would include pvp to begin with. Right now they serve as another method for old players to show off their e-peen because we all know that it's impossible to get into raids as a new player. ^^^/s

Same, my mouse only has so many buttons and I don't want to lose my special action key or F5 skill on my mouse.
---
Also, wish I could set alternate keybinds per character, but that's slightly unrelated.
---
I know Mr bot, but I must not dare to insult our precious carebears. The game runs because of them.
---
Why would having a second flying mount have that effect at all? If anything it's just more justification for the first one being hard to get.
---
Sorry I'm just coming back to the game after a break; I heard there was another WvW mount obtainable as well? Can someone link me to a guide or explanation of what is required to get that mount (what is it called?)? 
---
Don't want to miss out on either of them, this is pretty cool and unexpected.
---
Yes please
---
Lmfao, BGA talking shit after last night? No worries man, I'll have a nice tribute video to last night up shortly.  Big talk for the guild that got their shit kicked in all night. Roasted by a throwaway account ahahaha
---
I wonder how they'd incorporate a Mists map into the world map.
---
* pChrono will usually better for open world because it's power so you have a better burst than a general condi build (including condi Mirage) and mobs will usually have rather low health. You have roughly the same cleave power than Mirage (not much) but on pChrono you can make use a focus to pack mobs. However condi Mirage is probably a bit safer because it has more dodges for world bosses and big meta events if you struggle.
---
* Support Chrono is still pretty good in Fractals but is not anymore the only very good solution for boons. Many pug T4 groups still run Chrono + Druid from what I could see on EU LFG but some other run pFirebrand+Heal Ren (and very good groups can run with a Diviner Ren to get a bit more DPS).
---
Aurene is based off of Gryphon rig anyway. The Dragon might be aswell.
---
You can map break all maps of the game already (I do it often). Nothing new will happen.
---
&gt; Lets be real amount of condi cleanse and boon application exists only because of sizable Scourge condition application.
---
Many if not most classes can spam a similar number of conditions. Heck, conditions themselves are an issue. When what amounts to 50-100 unique effects in other games gets consolidated to just 5 or 7, and every class gets to apply most of them generously, it rapidly spirals out of control. The same goes for boons.   
---
We need more specialization, not more homogenization. Let necro apply poison and chill, thief apply bleeds and cripple, and engineers apply burning and weakness. Not give each of them every condition type in some form. But well, that would require a complete overhaul of the entire class, boon/condition, trait and build systems, so one could dream I guess?
---
The communicating and roadmap were top notch and I applaud them for the change. As far the new ads to get new players in I understand they weren't made to get the type of player I am and I'm ok with that at least they are trying new things.
---
Raids with easy, moderate , and hardcore mode with rewards that increase as mode gets harder.
---
Those ads aren't released yet. There are still ways they can touch up on them.
---
This mostly makes the springer irrelevant rather than the griffon.
---
The Griffon is a high speed jet that will still be a prestige mount. I highly doubt the dragon will have the same aerial prowess as the Griffon 🤔
---
&gt; Those 2/3 of the players **would play the easy mode**, trying to get into normal raids, see that they need certain builds/stats and stop trying to get into normal raids. :P
---
I see you got my point. Those players playing easy mode are lots of login hours generated from content that already exists with very little adjustments and development time. Its definately more cost-effective than developing new content for the 1/3 of the player base that already raided at least once before or is raid-ready. 
---
How much or if any of these easy-raiders will start playing regular raid content is certainly debatable but only a bonus in any case.
---
Anet pretty much said "Yeah, you can break out of maps now... have fun" a while back. 
---
It's a blast.
---
Need to do some research bc I don’t understand a thing u said xDddddd
---
This thing completes the aerial mobility portfolio - since it can gain height, clinge to walls and gain altitude this way, in combination with the Griffon it'll allow us to go just about everywhere.
---
Ah yes, the technical part has been answered already. I, like /u/ChmSteki was curious 'how' the radial menu works in WvW where only the warclaw is available... does the addon update the options so you've only got the one you can choose?
---
https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/#about
---
"Cool" is always subjective but i think that app lets you sort skins by trading post price
---
Wvw needs a Kralkatorik fight on EBG (remove SM completely) so that every player who wants to finish LS4 has to wait in endless queue. It would phase (fly off) multiple times and the only way to bring him back is to kill all enemy players nearby. It spawns every 2 hours and only one server can get the kill participation for the story. 
---
If you get disconnected during the fight, you have to wait full queue again. For performance purpose, map capscity would need to be reduced by 10 per server.
---
Anet just didn't go hard enough with the warclaw and bloodlust events (and other pve nonsense years ago). Give pve players what they want and they'll hate the game for life.
---
Now i totaly need radial mount menu.
---
Lot of people tend to have spider phobias so they won't want to use that as a mount I think
---
So this is the second mount for the season they were talking about, not the Warclaw that people seemed so adamant about when it was announced. Looks quite interesting.
---
As I understood, the dragon gains altitude but slower than the Springer jumps, the dragon is for situation where you don’t have a ground for the springer to stand (cliffs)
---
Grub more difficult than gorse pre and escort! Mortars hurt yo
---
the same point when battalions and platoons were created in real life.
---
I am glad there is none tbh
---
but in the end its just a mount for additional gem sink, what we need is content to keep players in game
---
It should have been made to some extent ( story, mastery ? ) they need to know how story will flow after episode 5. i am sure they know things about season 5 by now.
---
On top of what Kurosov said, supervising development doesn't mean dictating every single thing that goes into the game. Another developer could have added it, then showed what they did off, and she was surprised to find it was done/possible (especially since in this case, the game engine would make it not possible without tricky coding).
---
Pssst ...Radial Mount Add-On...it will change your life
---
except mushrooms you can pretty much start gliding/mount up as soon as you hit the apex of the arc.  maybe even a little bit before.  just feels like the delay is way higher for Bond of Faith or whatever its called.
---
Np, don't get me wrong, appreciated the confirmation it works too but as from my comment below, I was interested in how it works there too seeing as you only got the Warclaw. :)
---
Your answer was still relevant!
---
Forgive the [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qVSHgmY.png) link but...
---
The Warclaw! It's very easy to get. Put a point in the new warclaw wvw ability line, and you do some very easy achievements and a reward track to unlock it.
---
That happens only if you log out (so also character swap) while in WvW.
---
feels so much more tedious.  especially after so long
---
Tried it, not a fan compared to direct keybinds for speed. 
---
Only time I really have use for a radial menu for mounting is when I’m using the team controller because of it’s ability to instantly fire them.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
Apology accepted.
---
Wait... Why?? I'm so confused.. does the game need more mounts? Or is their data telling them a new mount + living story is the best way for returning player retention. Because that's a big, no. I'm sorry truth hurts.
---
How many of easy-fractal(ers) are playing t4 CMs?
---
True, yet it still sounds more natural to me... but then I am not a native, so hey.
---
if you press the keybind in WvW, it will only show you the warclaw in the 360 radius.
---
yes , next time with quaggans and choyas
---
Dungeon gear! The heavy sets look great (the Honor of the waves legs and crucible of eternity chest for me). Trouble is finding a group for it. Its relatively free and looks great too.
---
Judging by the video, it may be faster than Griffon without any diving and thus take a small chunk off the Griffon's usage territory. But wherever you have a little bit of height to spare for a dive, the Griffon will probably remain superior (and rightfully so).
---
Grub is more difficult than Gorse itself.
---
Every player playing t4 CMs was an easy-mode fractal runner when they started out.
---
Given Season 3, that would result in world destruction. It's been well established that if we are to kill any Elder Dragon, we **must** have a new dragon ready to replace the one we kill (or replace the ones we already killed).
---
My theory since the teaser, which is only made stronger with the Skyscale reveal, is that we find some sort of land with a bunch of dragons and find replacements there.
---
But those random asian candy crush rip-offs probably take a handful of employees a couple of weeks to conjure up, place a few ads, and make a bit of money to put food on the table with the hope that random algorithms will push it to the top and make them big bucks.
---
Being able to stay in the air forever sounds like flying to me.
---
Not phobic, but really just blegh on bugs in general. I wouldn't have used the roller mount if not for the armadillo skin.
---
okay, is this just a griffon skin or a complete separate new mount.
---
If so, I wonder what makes it so different, they could've just added the capabilities to the griffon imo.
---
Perhaps it’s a part of Tyria dragged into the Mists, that way they could put it on the world map.
---
Ah I missed that. 
---
I don't WvW much but as I recall, you can set a favorite mount which will be chosen if you just tap the key you bind to bring up the mount wheel. 
---
So in WvW set the Warclaw to the favorite mount, and it'll just be a single key press. And then outside of WvW you can still select the other mounts without any need to reconfigure the addon.
---
By the video, Skyscale (which I am constantly wanting to call Skyclaw - Skyscale is a silly name, esp now that we got Warclaw so recently) will function like no-mastery griffon, but with a higher altitude gain when flapping wings (which is probably mastery) and being able to rest on surfaces that griffon cannot (which may be a mastery too).
---
Basically, seems to me griffon and skyscale without masteries will function effectively the same, but with masteries, griffon will become like the rollerbeetle of the sky, while skyscale will be like the springer of the sky.
---
And I don't think the skyscale will make springer obsolete, since it seems it will climb at the same height as griffon's jump (aka springer without mastery).
---
so i guess this new dragon mount will have a longer airtime compared to griffon but not as fast as griffon? ill take that honestly
---
I agree to an extent. I also think the ads are *okay* at best, but it also depends on the context they're using them in. The Tyrian Tour videos for example; I would hate to see them as standalone advertisements but I think would function fine as an embedded video on a webpage, especially if they're discussing the differences between the races (though I wish the race's personalities were more faithfully stuck to, but I'm not the target audience here). 
---
I'm not the biggest fan of the live action ads, but I can see that the ads are targeted towards a casual audience that wouldn't normally peruse articles for information about MMOs on the market.
---
I can at least appreciate that they're making a push towards marketing their own game, as opposed to relying on players to spread word of mouth.
---
*ssssip* guild wars was a good game
---
Probably best not to. Just because we can and they know we can doesn't mean they want people doing it as it is sort of immersion breaking.
---
Perfect, looks like I'm finally jumping aboard the gw2radial bandwagon then! :)
---
Kind of pointless for the plot though, since the plot requires a living dragon to serve as a replacement to any Elder Dragon we seek to kill.
---
Bugs are cute and people can finally start to cure their oversensitivity
---
Except... we know we're going straight into season 5
---
I could outrun a Grub.
---
I still wish Joko used that mount.
---
And every raid CM was a t4 fractal or dungeon speedclear runner. Raids are even easier than some t4 fractals. It's not like people were born to play good out of nowhere, there's enough content to practice.
---
Yup, one boon + one condi per specialization or traitline would be great. But well, not in this game.
---
&gt; because the perfectly functional game coughcough doesnt recognize the sidebuttons itself
---
Controller software coughcough exists for a reason.
---
We only have to wait until they add a series of in-game radial menu for mounts, novelties, and combat voice lines.
---
Step 1: Spam the idea all over the place until it sinks in.
---
Except as the article says, it doesn't fly like a griffon.
---
I'm really curious as to how they will justify the existence of real (not wyvern) dragons in the lore... Are they affiliated to an Elder Dragon ?
---
If you've saved all your karma then you can get some cool looking stuff with that.
---
I don't think so. I think it will take considerable more time to reach the height Springer reaches with this mount. So Springer is still going to be better in those scenarios (and there are a lot of that scenarios!).
---
Thanks, for the reply, some good info for me to parse through. Right now I'm just in exotic gear having no tolerance for crafting (and having just hit 80). I have a second set of bezerker gear that I've been mostly wearing for just normal PVE stuff. I did just get a warhorn so have been figuring out how to use that. I know one of the youtube vids talked about blasting water fields. I guess I need to go through those a few more times.
---
You just released a picture with my identity and other players open to see for all.
---
I've made a ticket to anet about this and reported you to reddit as well.
---
We can see a large body of water, then scenery elements from maguuma and elona.
---
It doesn't seem like those areas are merely phased map areas like with the rift events.
---
Based on that, it would seem the new map will be in the empty lot south of Mount Maelstrom and west of Desert Highlands, or west from Thunderhead Keep.
---
Thank you! I don't have soul beast trained yet. I'm hoping to run into another HP train soon and start rebuilding my points.
---
Lol it looks funny now xd
---
what identity? the one your calling youself to write this thread?
---
Numpad
---
you do like your report button dont you....
---
&gt; And every raid CM was a t4 fractal or dungeon speedclear runner. Raids are even easier than some t4 fractals. It's not like people were born to play good out of nowhere, there's enough content to practice.
---
&gt; Besides, not all bosses/wings have same difficulty. There's plenty of easy ones.
---
Some may be easier than others but I guess your point of view is from someone who also was also a speedclear dungeon runner/fractal farmer. For people like you that are used to that kind of instanced group content, a new raid may look easy when it comes out and you play it for the first time. If a non-raider who hasnt done much fractals or dungeons before tries that raid for the first time, its a different story.
---
Coming from a casual player's perspective, this has indeed encouraged me to continue supporting Anet. There's no perfect game, but it's heartwarming to see how much effort they put into making the playerbase feel appreciated. Kudos Anet!!
---
U LIKE DIFFERENT FROM ME? U DUM
---
I wonder if we're gonna go to Dzalana and find a bunch of dragons and be like "Aurenes ded np"
---
I don't see what it does different?
---
You can buy weapon skins so when you'll use wardrobe unlock (well, if you get BLC keys sometimes) it would have higher chance to unlock something more valuable.
---
in your picture you have the name of his old and new account..
---
I kind of guessed new mount not from the teaser but this episodes team also introduced the beetle.
---
I'm not sure why gliding not being an important thing any more means they'll stop making mounts. They are a cash cow
---
I just started learning my way around some fractals, as a ranger. I'm sure my guildies will put up with me trying to learn the art of druidisim on some of these runs.
---
The fact that thousands of players sharing their little personal accomplishments would flood the hell of the sub, even more than it is ?
---
It can go straight up for a while, meaning that you could hop on the skyscale, leap of faith mid-air, and fly away in griffon.
---
It's like a bunch of different pieces that come together to leave every other mount system in any other game in the dust.
---
Would love to see them resin players as awakened vs dragon minions vs tyrians. Blue green red. Change the lords and such. It actually would have fit well in the next update considering kralk is in the mists. Iberu never fully dies so why not an awakened faction? Overrall Id like any attention paid to wvw and honestly I'm a fan of the warclaw other than its looks. Hasn't been bad for game beyond some bug fixes for jump exploits.
---
For what we've seen, the springer is way faster when it comes to gaining height, if you can get a foothold.
---
Without footholds, you'll need the skyscale to stick to the wall.
---
They also said no lake doric so you know don't trust Anet.
---
GW2 is on the market for almost 7 years now, everybody who wanted to try it already did. And that is what concern me about Arena Net is they try to encourage people to do something (in this case play gw2) before they fix issues with the game.
---
For example, Warclaw release, they didn't even think about fixing the game mode before they bring people back to the game mode.
---
Even if there'll be massive playerbase spike, what they are going to see when they hit 80 and try to get into end game? long PvP ques + bots everywhere, almost dead WvW on weekdays + scourge stacking aids meta and hollow raid lobby. 
---
Even tho I like the fact that ANet is trying to advertise the game the ordering of their actions is totally illogical to me.
---
Actually no, I never did dungeon speedclear (or anything close to clearing them fast) and I started t4 fractals slightly after I started raiding. 
---
I had 0 issues learning raids because it's way too easy with training groups, especially nowadays when there's sources of optimal builds and rotations and just general powercreep (no updraft gorse was a myth back then, now everyone skips even the first phase on Xera).
---
It's all about motivation and will to adapt, which people seem to not have.
---
Who still uses WASD? Put your hand in the natural typing position and use ESDF.
---
Fortunately they have strong winds and the No Mounts effect to keep things in check.
---
Yes from Eurogamer.
---
climbs walls, and breaths fire.. so far lol
---
If the springer takes 3 seconds to mount and jump, and this helidragon takes 6 seconds to mount and get to the same height, I think the springer will still be extremely relevant
---
You still have to bind keys for it.
---
For real tho, I really hope we don't have to press space for every single wing flag..
---
I've bound mine on the numeric keypad. Unless they add more than 10 I'm fine.
---
*cyrrilic
---
Then you start a second sub like they did for fashion and direct people their. Being an asshole is a terrible solution for something that isn't even a real problem.

["Living World Season 4, Ep. 4 Teaser Trailer"](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/living-world-season-4-ep-4-teaser-trailer?in=arenanet/sets/guild-wars-2-living-world-season-4)
---
What about other races? Or previewing something besides a chest piece? 
---
I thought that the whole excuse for not making outfits armor skins was that the chest and pants were too difficult to separate (so they are logically one piece). If they ARE one piece, then that would explain why when you preview a new chest piece, it removes both the chest and the pants.
---
This is actually a subtle hint at our plot destination direction for GW2. Tyria -&gt; Elona -&gt; Far North + Depths -&gt; Cantha

Hör dir Living World Season 4, Ep. 4 Teaser Trailer von ArenaNet an #np auf #SoundCloud

https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/living-world-season-4-ep-4-teaser-trailer
---
New player here. Idk what the episodes are, but the game is really fun.
---
Nightfall happens 3 years after Prophecies/Factions... Eye of the North happens 3 years after Nightfall.
---
Yes but those can be some arcane shit like alt+pgdown.
---
Except for, y'know, everywhere we went in GW1, and dealing with Jormag.
---
Actually overlap is what I WANT.
---
I rather have 20 different mounts which can do one of 3 different things (in their unique way) than 10 mounts that do 10 different things each.
---
Because the second option results in you being forced to change your mount constantly while the first options allows for more freedom.
---
For example the springer being just "hop on it if you want to go somewhere up and change back to a better mount again after" is not what I want. They can still have their unique mechanics but would it really be gamebreaking if the springer was a bit faster on the ground so it doesn't feel that bad if you just use it as a normal mount? (Or maybe even give the movement skill some alternative useage like "forward hopping")
---
I think the current mounts are at a decent position right now. The springer should probably just be faster, the skimmer should also be faster on normal ground (how about a higher max speed but turning reduces your speed more?) and the warclaw should be better balanced for PvE. All other mounts are in a pretty decent position and would only require small tweaks.
---
Just my opinion though.
---
"Why would people not want to try new things!!!"
---
Why would WvW players who think the mode is so bad and desperate for new players still play it and attack anybody new that tries to get into it? 
---
I wasn't interested in WvW but once I needed something for legendary weapons I got interested in it, it's called giving people who are not interested a reason to try it out.
---
Thanks mate!
---
Is this like a griffon with fire attacks or doesn't have the same sustainability in air? Only glides?
---
* Open World: Rev can provide better support to a small to big group of people (meta events) with Herald while doing decent DPS. Thief will have better personal DPS and wll have great survivability thank to [invigorating Precision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invigorating_Precision).
---
* Fractals (speaking for T4): Daredevil and Deadeye are a decent power DPS (even if they don't have the same burst aspect that DH, Weaver or Soulbeast have), you also have quick access to party stealth, smoke fields and blasts. Herald and Renegade DPS is a bit lower than that but Renegade can go Diviner/Healer in a FB+Ren comp.
---
* Raids: Both classes have various usefulness depending on the boss and both are both very viable (but it depends a lot on the boss, your group experience, the strat, etc).
---
* WvW: Thief is a very good roamer and a niche member of a zerg with Daredevil (but I wouldn't recommend it un pug zergs). Rev is good roamer with Herald and a very good range damage with Hammer in zergs (idk which spec is the best atm but it has varied from Herald to Ren and depends on your placement relative to your zerg)
---
So I guess it didn't help you that much because... both classes are very good and viable in each content (except maybe rev a bit less for T4 fractals).
---
be happy you still have stuff to work toward
---
I use the num pad for all my mounts, in order from 1-7 that we first got them. Still have space for a few more!
---
At daily reset people do it.
---
He looks to be in the Durmand Priory Library in Lornar's Pass.
---
Wonder did it pay off not to buy griffon all this time. Unless this has long and costly timegated (and it probably will, time-wise)
---
[See related article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-09-guild-wars-2-reveals-a-second-flying-mount-a-dragon-the-skyscale); griffon is for speed, skyscale is for height (but seems slower on initial climb than springer to not make that obsolete for cliff climbing).
---
Feels like the difference between raptor and springer, but in the air.
---
Most of the gemstore bundles such as the Account Jump Start are a complete ripoff.  You are paying full price for the premium items (the bank and bag slots in this case) and getting a bunch of junk (dyes, transmutation stones, and lootbox keys) for free. If you REALLY want to get the most bang for your buck, hold on to your gems until August.  Historically, some of the lowest prices have been during the [Anniversary sales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/Anniversary_Sales).
---
&gt;except to cordially wave as i go past.
---
I've ignored you for a week now as this is what GM's have suggested that I do.
---
Please stop harassing me with your emotes, you can walk by perfectly fine without being an ass.
---
[Dragons in Tyria are not new.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bone_Dragon)
---
It can scale walls and gain altitude in flight, but is apparently much slower than the Griffon.
---
The only thing you are REALLY missing out on from the expansions is gliding from HoT and mounts from PoF but neither are compulsory to complete the base game content. Most long-time players went YEARS without these features and some like myself even did full map completion without them. By the time you finish the story from the base game the expansions should hopefully be on sale again :)
---
&gt; "Why would people not want to try new things!!!"
---
So why not implement an oil pumping simulator in GW2?   
---
You first get to spend 10 years collecting all of the necessary papers and licking the asses of all of the local bureaucrats and ecology activists. Then you keep doing geological surveys for another 10 years. Then you proceed to buying the rights to the required technology.. 
---
Sounds like a fun and engaging addition to GW2, right? No? Why? Are you against trying new things?! 
---
&gt; Why would WvW players who think the mode is so bad and desperate for new players still play it and attack anybody new that tries to get into it?
---
You still don't understand it. I don't know how to get it across to you that people want more players who want to be engaged in PVP fights in WvW, not in running away from PVP to wail at some bosses. Why would I want to have PVE players in WvW, again? They don't want to fight me. They don't want to team up with me. They don't want me around at all because I will ruin their precious PVE gameplay by, you know, killing them. What would I gain from having them around? They don't enrich the play mode, they don't add anything useful at all except more lag.
---
FYI, the previous trailer announcing the episode teased this new mount.  [You just had to catch it in time](https://i.imgur.com/bEpMDlE.png).
---
Your numberpad is your movement?  How do you do camera control?  Lefthanded mouse?
---
Nah, I dont mind it.
---
Also best to wait to see it in action before deciding if its good or bad.
---
Might have low energy pool even
---
Variant of the spider guild race in Dredgehaunt, yes please!
---
that's not actually accurate. i did the wvw method with the same idea in mind. iirc the mothod would not let me unlock the very last HP, so i had to find that - bit annoying - and unlock it manually. however that instanly triggered all other map completion rewards and i got mauled by mail carriers. HoT doesn't have that quirk, so you can just unlock away, and PoF map completion is just irrelevant beyond achievements.
---
Yep. Left handed razor naga for all my skills, targeting, mounts and camera.
---
Personally, it feels like an attempt to fill in missing gaps as a means to ensure every episode has a useful mastery. While I'm not opposed to the Skyscale, I don't see it as really necessary, but it isn't harmful either.
---
 Alex Kain wrote the first story, also wrote the lore for Warclaw and appeared on Guild Chat talking about Warclaw post-release.
---
DRACARYS
---
As amazing as the skill system in GW1 was - the GW2 version is more streamlined and arguably more user-friendly. Trying to go back to GW1 now feels painful.
---
Haven't happened before, it's a bug.
---
GW2 employs what's called "Living Story" to release new story content, as opposed to constantly releasing expansions. Living Story is episodic, so each new story chapter is called an "episode," much like a TV series.
---
&gt;That is reversing the burden of responsibility
---
If you are already taking on the responsibility of being a pseudo-moderator through asshole behaviour, you migh as well do something non-toxic. 
---
&gt;Low effort, low investment, or the ones that every player has (can I create a thread for having reached lvl 30 first time ?) have no real place on a global sub.
---
And under which of these categories does 10k AP fall?
---
I think the tourism videos are garbage. They're cute, but don't make the world seem exciting (and they mis-pronounce aSURa, FFS, how do you even add a Z in there). I think the live action ones are at least humorous if not at least a little hype-inducing (particularly from the line "join a legion 11 million strong").
---
The CGI one seems to be getting hate for the art style, mostly. I honestly don't see the reasoning. WoW does way worse and most of that game looks like it was made on the N64. There's nitpicks like the Magic Technicolor Weapons and crotch-goblin asura, but I can see it being the most effective GW2 ad in terms of drawing people in.
---
But pressing it manually is 10% more efficient due to lag prediction/netcode delay compensation.
---
Inb4 only usable in the new map.
---
You can wing flap before the endurance bar is full if you manually press it, allowing you to maintain height for a longer distance.
---
How to map break with mounts: have lag,get on mount, mount doesn't load but run forward anyways, jump off mount,fall through map.
---
Aurene has been reborn... and she can climb walls now.
---
&gt; and combat voice lines to give orders to your squad.
---
I had that back in 2003 in PS. GIVE ME BACK.
---
Lol, no hardcore wvw guild will let noob join them.
---
Although fights between those guilds are hype for GvG community
---
Ah I see. That's cool. How often are the episodes released? And are they worth whatever money they cost?
---
Yes, you can, but not everywhere, everytime. Not like the springer can jump anywhere, the skimmer can float anywhere.
---
I approve, if they only replace deserted BL with alpine again, it will be great. back to 3 playable borders, up from 2
---
You know, that sounds like the perfect opportunity to finish some of the overworld's unfinished JPs and minidungeons. They could put the entrance behind one if these walls. 
---
I speaking, or course, specifically about Cerebro because it's a travesty that area was never finished.
---
&gt; I'm not the biggest fan of the live action ads, but I can see that the ads are targeted towards a casual audience that wouldn't normally peruse articles for information about MMOs on the market.
---
These are the ads that I furiously skip when they pop up on Youtube. They're pretentious, and yet when the live action stuff ends, they present mediocre, unappealing shots of the game and a random slogan that means nothing.
---
You know, I actually think these also were repurposed promo materials for a cancelled game. "Everyone is summoned"? Yeah, that sounds about right for the launch of a game where you summon heroes and fight with them - not so much for actual GW2 where even in PvE story, barely anything like that happens.
---
Sure, but why should it be lowered? I see no benefit other than being more accessible (and certainly it would detract from the obvious benefit of being a gold sink), but it wasn't designed for accessibility - it was designed for prestige. 250 gold is not much, but it's enough to make it feel like a significant investment and if that's hard for you, you can feel proud you achieved it once you get it. Why would you want to take away from that?
---
There goes the theory of griffon rentals  
---
Poors btfo
---
She also has like 4 ex machinas inside her. I think I tend to agree that she's dead, but I think she's dead in the same way Glint is. i.e. still very much a force in the story
---
I don’t care about taking longer for a boss or wiping a few times with PuGs. 
---
But omg the waiting time. Sit around for an hour for full squad, with the last person insisting to log around to 5 different characters to ping *all* the kp they have, even if it’s waaaaay above the requirement. Sit around another 5 minutes until everyone makes it into the raid. And another five because someone went afk or forgot to buy food and goes out to the tp before asking if someone can send some. Sit around some more while the chronos and druids coordinate their skills. If the boss has mechanics, at least five more minutes because there are never enough volunteers for those. 
---
Then *finally* a readycheck, squad wipes to some stupid reason, someone leaves, restart.
---
I did mention if you had enough height. The point being it does fly, not “fall with style”.
---
i suggest you ask some WvWers how much they already enjoy DBL lords over classic lords.
---
Think you can do it on Saturday evenings. I did it the Saturday just past.
---
Ah, I see. That's a cool idea. How often are these episodes released? and how much money would it cost to get caught up on all the content?
---
Well if there's one thing most people seem to agree on, Anet nailed it with their mounts, so I have high hopes for this (though I will admit the prospect of a wall-climbing spider mount is something I would have been happy to see too). 
---
What I'm really hoping for is they really put our new flying friend to work in the new map - tons of secrets and hidden areas, tons of exploration and even better good rewards for engaging with all that exploration. We'll see. 
---
Skyscale - I do like the name, too.
---
There was a FAQ long before the game launched and one of the questions in the FAQ was "Is Guild Wars 2 a true MMO" and it was answered in that.
---
Even the briefest research into the product should have given you that idea, since you could see videos of a hundred people fighting a boss at the same time.
---
There was plenty of information out there saying it was an MMO.
---
Who's the asshole here ? The one that states this post might not have his place (OP of this chain), or you, that straight goes for the throat, throwing insults left and right ? Who's toxic, who's aggressive ?
---
Voiced opinions are also physical opinions, this post (like many others) remains at 0.
---
I want a nosferatu Zodd skin for this one. :3
---
The CGI trailer looks like the possibly cancelled Mobile App they've been working on. I can't exclude also the other stuff wasn't created to promote it for that purpose. Maybe the cancelled game was supposed to drop soonish but NCSoft stepped in and redirected those resources.
---
I just thought it looked amazing. Are we not supposed to post screen shots here? Sorry I'm new to this subreddit.
---
&gt; They're unlisted.
---
I know that. And? The only reason to upload them beforehand is to get their description ready for fast publication when it's time to make them visible.
---
Unless, of course, they're using Youtube to test these ads on us, only making it look like "teasers" and "communication". But I don't think, given the record, their marketing department thinks that far ahead.
---
Other players can indeed see this. I was playing around with this last night :D

I don't care much either way, but I think the whole [LWS4 spoiler](#s "eating of Joko and absorbing his powers thing") at least leaves a sincere question mark on aurene's permanent death.

Beetle boost through 90% of all completely vertical walls.

Orrrrr climb altitude with dragon and then leap, switch to griffon and then zoom.
---
interesting. im actually faster with radial, as all good to reach keybinds are already used up and for me its faster ro press one button on my mouse to trigger the menue
---
Denial? Aurene coming back is granted. It's one of their merchandise.
---
it seems you dont get it at all. Players play WVW to fight ANOTHER PLAYERS, not NPC, not caping objectives, not doing meta events, not ramming gates under fire from 10 acs. This is the reason why organised fights exist - so ppl can actually fight. wvw vets dont care about loot, they dont care about achievments, ranking, ppt and other gimmisks. All they want is fight. Much more desired improvements will be a zone without structures and stuff, a big round flat earth where ppl spawn and fight each other with loot disabled to prevent farming.
---
I'll let them know right away! Happy to see Scarf Dragon is doing well, they are newish. :3
---
Episodes are usually attempted to be released every 3-4 months, barring any delays. That particular episode is free for any person who logs in in the timeframe before the next episode release.
---
They've been giving away older episodes of this current season (season 4) in an PR/goodwill campaign, so check the gemstore to get the currently advertised episode for free. Otherwise, I think they'll be in the 10-20 dollar range depending on whether or not you're buying the entire season or individual episodes.
---
The important thing to keep in mind is that Living Story is tied to expansions. Season 3 is tied to the HoT expansion, season 4 is tied to the PoF expansion, so you'd need to get them to experience the Living Story seasons. LS seasons are also purchasable with in game currency, by farming gold and converting them to gems (I believe this may require you to not be F2P, but I'm not sure). Assuming you're tight on money but have time to farm, this might be a better avenue for you to take.
---
Thank you for the info, Do you think it's worth the irl dollars to get all of them?

By doing so griffon doesn't go up as much as it does with full endurance. And it's pretty visible.

Good ol' suicide partys in LA
---
&gt; If you are already taking on the responsibility of being a pseudo-moderator through asshole behaviour,
---
so the moderators here are all assholes?
---
Most players, in fact, don't even play anymore.
---
That's true. It took me a long time and a lot of crafting materials to gather enough gold for the griffon (but I love her to bits).
---
Although I wonder how much gold the Skyscale will cost. We don't need another luxury mount.
---
Anything added to WvW must encourage fights between players. For example: 
---
* Events that spawn randomly in random spots, attracting players from all teams in one spot. 
---
 * There would be a higher chance for these events to spawn when things are slow, and they would never spawn while there's  swords on map or while a keep is contested. 
---
 * Completing the event and capturing the objective could give a mobile version of a siege machine. Since these siege machines would come only from events that can't be started on demand, there would be no danger of people overstacking too many of them like when people do golem trains. 
---
* Replace the central ruins with a more PvP-oriented event. 
---
 * The central area in each borderlands would be replaced with a huge coliseum with two entrances, one north, one south. 
---
 * Once or twice per skirmish, an event on the center of the map would start in which teams fight 20v20 for a bonus for their world that will last for 2 hours. The event would have 2 stages: Entry and Match. 
---
 * Entry stage determines which 2 teams will fight in the Match. Players have to fight each other to capture either the north or south points. Once a team has captured one entry point that point will teleport away any member of the other teams and make players of that team immune within that area, like in the starting base. Then on the second point players from the first winner team are teleported away to the first entry captured, and the second entry point is left to be contested between the two remaining teams.  
---
 * After the teams that will fight in the coliseum have been determined, there will be a short 5-10min recess so the two teams can ready up 20-player  squads that will enter the Coliseum to fight.
---
 * After the teams are made, the Coliseum goes into "Match mode", any player who isn't part of the team can enter the colliseeum from the west and east spectator entrances and watch from the grandstands. At this point all around the Coliseum and within the grandstands players are neutral to each other so they can't fight. There would be a lot of usable seats, and while sittings spectators will get a skill they can activate to enter a 'ghostly' mode that will allow them to watch the match closer while invisible. It'll be something similar to the nova transformation from the fractal console or the beedog transformation, just making the user also invisible so it won't disturb the fight or the view from other spectators. Cancelling the transformation will send you back to the grandstands. 
---
 * Once the timer ends, both teams enter the Coliseum arena and fight it out. The match will be an team deathmatch with elimination and score similar to PvP matches. The arena will be mostly an open space with a few columns for cover scattered near the edges of the arena.  
---
 Players will be removed from the arena if they are finished, go down 3 times (regardless of death penalty), or leave the arena. 
---
 * The team that eliminates the enemy team, gets 500 points first or has the most points within the 30 min timer wins.
---
 * Whoever wings gets bonus warscore for their world, the Bloodlust effect and bonus rewards that depend on how many points their team got. Those who participated in the capture event or that were participating in capture or defense events during the events will also get bonus rewards. 
---
 * This could also be done by teleporting players to a different map after they capture the entry points, so the match won't take player population from the mist war. 
---
* Give supply lines from camps to keeps their own meta-events. When an entire line is captured and defended, the supply shipments would be larger, and those who participate in any of the events of the meta-event would get extra participation, score and rewards, encouraging people to defend even camps and sentries, rather then mostly focusing on keeps and towers. 
---
 * Introduce a new "Defensive wall" siege blueprint to place walls around objectives, specially camps. These will only be placeable within specific areas, but they would not be fixed spots like with keep defense siege, allowing some freedom on how to place them, but still not being able to close paths like roads and entrypoints. There would also be a limit on how many walls can be placed in an objective. This would give a bit of 'tower defense' feel to defending camps from other players.   
---
 Defensive walls will have a mastery that will increase their health and armor when placed or repaired by someone with a high mastery. If placed by someone with a max Defensive Wall mastery, they will become Spiked Walls. Walking against or being thrown (pushed, feared or launched, etc) against a spiked wall will cause immobilize for 1s, damage and bleeding.
---
Mount team is/was seperate from LW content designers. And mount team leader left anet right after PoF.
---
Anyway i advice to keep vram at lower usage. Maybe setting textures to low will show much more difference then character limit, just to test out.
---
Where is the new info graphic? I have been waiting for one since POF!
---
Time will show. :)
---
&gt; What went wrong in your life that you can't even let somebody share a personal accomplishment
---
They can share it on their personal reddit profile where everybody interested in their personal accomplishment can see it.
---
Colin used to overhype stuff and under MO anet was too quite.
---
Now they seem to have found a nice middle ground and hopefully the community appreciates it, and doesn't complain too much if the stuff they've said they are working on takes long to implement so we don't go back to anet being silent again.
---
Never. Every mount skin in gw2 is original design and they don't buy 3rd party licenses to use in their game.
---
Now is a good time for it, they're giving away episodes as part of their returning player initiative!
---
That mount is incredible!! Nice addition!!
---
I can’t find the new one either
---
The give out season 4 for free atm. Right now ep. 2 is for free in the gemstore, next week it will probably ep 3, and so on.
---
Friendly fire in raids.
---
Well sorry guys if i have a different memory. I just dont remmember people playing in same manner, but it is obviously as you say. Furthermore, recently i even heard someone say on guild discord about patch when blobs became a thing. Maybe topic was about smth a bit different. Thank you for your great comments, but also unnecesary sarcastic comments.
---
I like this history because it shows how stupid their reasoning can be. They were afraid of harassing players with arachnophobia, but in Episode 4 we have to fight spider boss who devours our character.
---
Cool story anet, keep trying.
---
where do you use autohotkey?
---
&gt;Edit: I guess you could say that I'm leaning towards Firebrand, and was just wondering if that was a good class for someone who wishes to focus on supporting/healing allies. 
---
If all you're looking for is validation of your bias, then yes Firebrand is a "good" specialization for support. It does well with defensive (Regeneration, Aegis) and offensive (Fury, Might, Quickness) boons, and has some decent healing (Staff, Bow of Truth).
---
Alright, I'll test it and let you know if there's any difference.
---
It's like we assume this mount won't cost 250g and a bunch of achievements.
---
This is true, but a daily will remind you years after the completion what you had to do :D
---
There are some cases where raptor is best, and some where jackal is best.
---
Heheheh maybe that's why they got rid of it
---
those inbetween animations are disgustingly jittery, i really hope anet fixes them before release. the warclaw suffers from minor choppiness so i hope anet cleans this big boi up. i want to love this chungy companion, i really do
---
*Death on mount equals to dead person
---
What has scales, breathes fire and can fly? A ~~dra~~ skyscale of course!
---
why is eternal coliseum so popular in ranked pvp?
---
Griffon: Yare yare, looks like I have to get serious now. *Disappears*
---
Dragon: *Looks behind in panic* He's fast!
---
*Smashed like a bug*
---
There was a joke and you just missed it.
---
Basically i was more asking for a skin that more closely looks like spyro, but of course isn't.
---
We can colour ourself.
---
Like our beetle the hedgehog.
---
Mine is called griffon mount
---
Griffon: Am I a joke to you?
---
Friendly dragons have existed for a while. https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kuunavang
---
Never said nor even implied it
---
I'm not saying gw2 skill system is bad. I'm being sarcatstic about what picture ANet paints for both of these games.
---
It will probably be a lot slower than the griffon to balance the two.
---
Springer on the other hand...maybe speed again? You can gain height indefinitely with the dragon but the springer will launch you much faster? I still feel like most people would use the dragon...
---
Numpad is what I use,but I do acknowledge that many players are on laptops or smaller keyboards.
---
I have 18 more G-Keys to bind mounts to (ignoring the Warclaw, which I am). That would be way too many mounts, though.
---
They should just show everyone this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMCZcwseYLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMCZcwseYLQ) 
---
Better promo material then that weird CGI stuff.
---
My point was that, if they are pushing that Living World can do everything an expansion can, they may do something crazy like have Season 5 start off with a new mount-level feature that becomes the new paradigm. It all depends on whether they think they can use the Seasons to create a sustainable stream of content.
---
LWS1 and 2 were unsustainable because releases were too far apart.
---
HoT basically drained the content pipeline and proved to be the boom-and-bust cycle the devs had feared.
---
LWS3 was decently successful as they got into the cadence and suffered mostly from people not liking bouncing between story beats.
---
PoF and LWS4 have seemed to strike a good balance. Yes, there are people complaining about "nothing to do" but it's coming from the player's fault, not the content's (in general). It's not like in S3 where it was "well, there's nothing to do but farm Bloodstone Fen for the next 4 months." It's "well, I don't want to find Joko's staff head, so I guess I'll log off and declare the game ded on reddit."
---
We'll see. I'm just looking at potential ways that they might take the game in the future.
---
So what makes this different from the griffon?
---
I had no idea about these requiems.
---
I loved reading that just now. And the art. But I'm confused. I recall them writing mini stories like this alongside living world season 1 and the community hated it. They scrapped them in favor of fleshing out characters and story in game instead. The community argued that it's a game and we shouldn't have to visit the website for the story. We should play it instead. ANET listened.
---
So why now have they decided to write these stories again? They seem to flip around a lot.
---
Nope, lowest vs highest textures doesn't have any FPS difference plus the VRAM usage was only around 1.8GB so indeed not maxed out, same with RAM (90% usage and I've played with 95% usage in other games without issues).
---
GPU usage overall was at around 60% so it indeed seems like CPU bottleneck. This leads me to think that d912pxy would mainly help CPUs with more than 4 threads? I know i5-6600 isn't that great in 2019 but its single-core performance is still nothing to sneeze at.
---
I imagine the Springer will be faster upwards, and given it doesn't glide it'll prob be easier to hit a single point (ie. The top of a spire) without overshooting and having to double back.
---
My bet is on east of Domain of Istan, Istan already has lots of cliffs as well, and the whole style of the map feels istan-y to me
---
theres rifts at the beginning of the video on top of the mountains
---
NO. No, giant spider is ***NOT*** bae. Absolutely not. Especially not with how GW2's spiders are all creepy as fuck looking. Holy shit fuck no.
---
It feels very mid-2000s f2p Asian MMO... Kinda nostalgic actually.
---
Ahahah made me think of something similar:
---
#Use a waypoint when dead
---
thats why I am asking.
---
&gt; Seriously why is it WvW players can only complain about things and not suggest something for the game mode besides "make X class worse please!!"
---
Can you please stop pretending that when a grand total of 5 builds are viable in an entire game mode that is a gigantic problem?   
---
It's like next time you get into a raid, power weavers do 80k dps and all other DPS specs of all classes do 10k dps, and PVP players will keep chiming in with insightful comments like "L U L y R u MaD u CaN StIlL pLaY sUpPoRt ChRoNo!11!1".
---
I've been using the numpad, but this new mount will be #8, so I can't hold a ton more without getting creative (plus, it means I have to rebind everything if I want to play instruments with autohotkey). Having a radial selection or something similar would be amazing.
---
I'm hoping it'll be the map to finally connect Core Tyria to Path of Fire presumably fitting in between Mount Maelstrom and Desert Highlands/Crystal Oasis.
---
I still wish they would have called the pangolin skin a pangolin skin and not an armadillo skin. Pangolins deserve to be recognized as a creature that exists - at least until China/Vietnam/etc put them into extinction.
---
theres bear ghosts! WHY IS NOBODY TLKING ABOUT THE BEAR GHOSTS: WHAT ARE THEY; WHY BEARS? I dont understand. I want to see norn lore but 99% sure not. But why bear ghosts???
---
&gt; Can you please stop pretending that when a grand total of 5 builds are viable in an entire game mode that is a gigantic problem? 
---
not saying its a problem but guess what?? Once one is nerfed another takes its place, you'll never get balance, that is the problem with EVERY PVP mode in every game.
---
War + claw, Sky + scale. I see some pattern in the naming of these. Let me leak names for next few mounts:
---
Rockfur
---
Icetusk
---
Treetooth
---
Windtail
---
Why another flying mount? How about an underwater one?
---
Well, did griffon make all other mounts irrelevant?
---
Next would be Waterfin.
---
&gt; However, each of those ads are hitting a mainstream interest (sports, music, etc.) that may hold people at first glance long enough to be caught off-guard by the ending message,
---
That's a valid point and I see how those interests could be used as hooks. I'm still, though, saddened that the second part of the ad is so bland and unimpressive - firstly, because it *really* clashes with the production quality of the live action fragments, and secondly, because I know that the game can offer, aesthetically, a lot more than what is pictured. As these ads are, I think they'll confuse more potential viewers than they'll excite to try out the game.
---
I use Shift+Numbers. When it was 1-5 it wasn't too bad but now it is up to 8 with the upcoming mount I believe. That said, you don't need to change mounts that often and for the majority of time I can just use the mount key for whatever I had set (e.g. Warclaw in WvW, Jackal elsewhere) and then just keybind to Springer or Griffon as needed. So you really only need to keybind mounts you use often and a lot of them like Roller Beetle, Warclaw, Raptor, and such don't need prominent keybinds.
---
&gt; Having one doesn't mean you can't have the other.
---
Indeed, having a gaming mouse with many buttons doesn't mean you can't have a gaming keyboard with even more extra buttons.
---
That's a daily I wouldn't mind skipping. :)
---
Oh wow! I'm saving this for when I wanna show people how pretty this game can be
---
All I want is to have separate box for consumables and stuff I can access without entering inventory, with a way to set up keybinds too. It may even use bag slot, I don't care.
---
The Black Citadel... and honestly, pretty much all of Charr lands, are woefully under-explored and under-utilized.
---
Achievement for auren skin???????
---
Radial lets me swap mounts while moving and using the keyboard. I don't have any keys left near enough to WASD that I could do that without it, and certainly not eight of them.
---
There are players which are worse than bots.
---
That's all the other guy is contesting. Generally when you play 1600-1700, heck even 1500 long enough, you literally start comparing some players to bots because you find it difficult to imagine a human being so bad at the game.
---
yea i love gw2 but the devs havent been doing a good job deliverying meaningful contents in the past year. i hope things will change
---
Yeah, it's almost like they don't care anymore about the enjoyment and impact the story has; as long as it gets people making accounts. I'd be so disheartened as a lore and story lover of games to be shown this prior to even downloading. I love this scene, and want people to see it, but this way feels a bit icky.﻿
---
Same thought on the thing with switching mounts fast...
---
I don't even keybind them as I never felt the need to swap mounts extremely fast.
---
Heya, I quit the game around about when Path of Fire came out and I'm thinking about downloading it again. Has there been any major changes to the game since I've been gone and has there been anything important I've missed? :)
---
my wvw scourge with 6 phospholuminescent infusions
---
I have a G600. I suggest to bind those mounts to something like "SHIFT+#", where # is a button on your mouse.
---
Obv if you like me have a side numpad config, it's really easy to get used to.
---
My current guess is Scavenger's Causeway. Fairly close to Elona, not too far from Thunderhead, so it's fitting with the region.  At the same time, it's also reasonably close to Mount Maelstrom, so that can account for the lush foliage we see in some areas.
---
My guess is that there's going to be a very mountainous region right next to the sea, as we do indeed see a coastline, but this also explains why the area looks like it's floating in the Mists-- the landscape just drops away when it reaches the coast.
---
Most importantly, it's an area so far unexplored in both GW1 and GW2, meaning it's a great place to let their imaginations go wild, reveal a new creature (skyscale), and let loose our battlefield against Kralkatorrik.
---
Plus, Scavenger's Causeway is in such a unique region of the world, where it could theoretically be influenced by any of the surrounding areas, those being the Tarnished Coast, Orr, Crystal Desert, Elona, and Deldrimor Front. Or it could just be totally its own thing.
---
Since they released this teaser I have doubts they are gonna fix it. They are probably done with this mount already.
---
But on a serious note, I think it looks cool!
---
Yup!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bb6qbl/skyscale_new_mount/
---
Also if you're only missing an episode or two it might be worth waiting until after season 5 kicks off as they might put out a bundle to complete season 4 for cheaper (unless they already have that).
---
I don't know about that. I've been playing since launch, and I don't feel like I've ran out of things to work torward.
---
I mean, do you even count something that's 0% present as something that's "the least present?"  I certainly don't.
---
I'm on ros. Kiss is trash. Gandara is also, complete and utter garbage.
---
The question is will we aquire it during the story or will it be locked behind a grind like the griffon. Also, what will be the point of the griffon, seems like the dragon does everything better
---
Well it's very situational, but I use fast switches for switching between jackal/raptor + skimmer (from land to water or the other way around), jackal/raptor + bunny (climbing as you reach a wall/cliff/tower/whatever) or jackal/raptor + griffon (jumping off cliffs). 
---
The important thing around enemies is that you won't get in fight mid mountswitch, if you manage to switch fast enough ;)
---
But yeah I don't need EVERY mount accessible any given moment.
---
They’re complete trash!  They refuse any legit type of payment like paypal. Ask you upload a photo of your ID then suggest using pre paid cards for purchase.  Just use CDKEYS. Prices are the same with much better reviews and they also let you use paypal
---
That is a great idea! Thank you!
---
What type of bear is best?
---
I wish it's original animations tbh... 
---
Not like warclaw and it's Griffin/raptor recycled mounts
---
They could also still design obstacles that the springer can get over but the skyscale can't. Like cliff edges that jut out, assuming the skyscale can't cling to ceilings.
---
I want a context sensitive bind for mounts. Pressing a button will pull out on a mountain based on where you are. If you are in water, you will attempt to use the Skimmer. If you are in the air, you can set the bind to pull out either the Griffin or Skyscale. If you are in land, you can set the bind to pull out the Jackal, Beetle, Raptor, or Springer.
---
It is easier to get than griffon or beetle, but it is a grind, especially if you don't have WvW reward track boosters. The reward track takes several hours to complete.
---
I’m actually impressed Andt found a way to design a new aerial mount without minimizing the griffon.
---
I’m actually hyped.
---
This comment right here is the fundamental problem with GW2 players at large.
---
People who actually invest in WvW or PvP don't play for loot or rewards. They are nice bonuses to reward for your time and incentivize people like yourself.
---
What we actually play for I imagine, is glory and the competition itself. It is far more rewarding to kill someone in an engaging and well balanced fight, than to loot some newbie when he dies without much effort.
---
Want proof? Why is duelling and GVG so prevalent in WvW culture? You don't really get much if any loot when compared to farming random pug groups, yet people enjoy it far more.
---
PvP and WvW is about proving you are the best player/players for the job by besting the opposition and the joy derived from that glory of skill. Not silly bags in your inventory.
---
You hugely missed the mark here.
---
I can only speak for myself, but I would only still play PvP if no chests came from ranked because I love the combat in this game first and foremost.
---
? The oldest millenials are into their mid thirties and you've still got a decade and a half of Gen-Xers before you get to boomers. So what exactly am I missing with this comment? Millenial doesn't mean "young people" any more than "baby boomer" inherently means old.
---
Depends what you enjoy content wise. I think a lot of people are frustrated because there is so much to do but no real reward for doing it
---
Spiders aren't technically bugs, they're arachnids.
---
I love these graphics BTW
---
I dont know exactly, but it was from around 2011, so it was a big upgrade for me.
---
Peter is the fat south makes sense
---
Game has been saved, yet another mount they can milk people with.
---
&gt;
---
There is basically no additional info or value posted beside that, no story about their journey, their characters or their plans for the future.
---
&gt;Besides that, OP didnt really reply to any feedback after posting, not even those that congratulated them.
---
Fair enough
---
You should really see a doctor if there are bugs in your ass.
---
Like the effort spent on creating dungeons?
---
yeah i understand. By the way, if your going to grind this one out, you might want to do this one at the same time:  (http://dulfy.net/2017/10/04/gw2-the-desolation-achievements-guide/#Realm-Portal_Spiker_10_AP).  I believe there is a legendary boss at the end of it.

---
Pretty easy... its a kinda know fact that the raft isnt moving at all but instead the world is moving around you... thats why you are able to jump on the raft or use planted bombs
---
Ok. 
---
So I suppose I need to finish my Griffon before that.
---
This is one of these adverts that would need "not in game footage" written at the bottom in my country and as much as I like GW2 and want it to be more successful I totally ignore all these - really what does it tell me about the game anyway?
---
Aurene skin when?
---
Have you checked out the [Whispers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Whisper%27s_Secret_armor)/[Priory](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Priory%27s_Historical_armor)/[Vigil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vigil%27s_Honor_armor) gear?  It is relatively cheap.
---
Also, if you do the weekly lvl 10 key grind and have some [black lion statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette#Armor_Sets) there are armour skins on the last of the shopping tabs that change rather regularly.  I think there are 3 of each armour type right now.  It is 30 statuettes/ set
---
And the [dungeon stuff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon_armor) is neat.  I picked it up for my light armour toons since I detest the frilly panty look that is so common in the higher level gear.
---
[why complain?](https://gph.is/1pGcshG)
---
I cannot wait. I think this night be some of,the best story so far with what happened last episode, I think this next one can make or break this season.
---
This is what I do, I use left alt+1-6...and counting.
---
[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/166a2eb29d04-Verdarach.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/166a2eb29d04-Verdarach.png) What is the sword he is holding?
---
Eh another mount i wont bother getting
---
but that's where all my skills are!
---
For me, I use CTRL/SHIFT (bound to mouse) and Q/E
---
What if.. What if he likes WvW.....
---
use modifiers lol. Ctrl+Shift+(1,2,3,4...)
---
Ctrl/Alt + G600 button = 36 buttons. Gw2 has what, 10 skills at any one time?
---
You literally just said in the comment above that you don't need finicky software solutions and then you go on to say you need a finicky software solution. What.
---
Or tapeworm 🤢
---
Why not an Infinite Radial Menu like warframe?

&gt;### Magnificent Hummingbird Skimmer Skin

&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ada99MTX_Hummingbird01-590x332.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ada99MTX_Hummingbird01-590x332.png)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ada99MTX_Hummingbird01.png)
---
&gt;Some people believe hummingbirds are a sign of victory in battle and good fortune. Purchase this beautiful hummingbird skin directly—or unlock Black Lion Chests for a chance for it to drop—and then dart across the water in a flash. You can use this skin on skimmer mounts across your whole account.
---
&gt;### Light in Darkness Chest

---
&gt;Even when it feels like the darkest moments are upon you, there is always a light to guide you. Inside each chest, you’re guaranteed to find a Mini Blue Skimmer Pup, a redeemable Black Lion Statuette, and two common items. You also have a chance to discover something rarer in the fifth slot, including exclusive items, glyphs, and skins from the Keepsake Weapon Collection and Chaos Weapon Collection.
---
&gt;**Guaranteed Item: Mini Blue Skimmer Pup**
---
&gt;A group of rays is called a fever, but there’s no need to worry about having too many of these adorable skimmer pups—head over to the Mystic Forge and combine them with some Unidentified Dyes to obtain a collection of pups in assorted colors and styles.

The marketplace is an in-game browser. It likely uses some form of Chromium, probably using Coherent to insert it, but definitely not the only interface using Coherent.

Changing the elements of the UI on the fly like they did with the squad UI on the fly like they did back then would be likely much more difficult otherwise.

Are they straight up story related or do they come with like new gear sets and stuff?

They did say in the news its able to gain height.

Very much so.

KD would disagree with you. Besides, no guild wanted to be in t1 anyway, it's just that nightcrew was impossible to stop. Luckily nightcrew stopped playing as soon as deso dropped.

Griffon is still a lot faster, and I doubt this is going to be cheap either since flying is such a big thing.
---
Nice, now we'll get AC monkey tears for 10 hours !
---
Wait there are add-ons you can use?
---
Looks like it can wall hop. That would be interesting if the mount could pull that off.
---
Appears to be bugged at the moment.
---
I think so- even if you exclude the story and stuff, I love playing in the zones, especially S3E4, S3E5(if you have the awesome mastery), S4E1, and S4E2. 
---
In S4E2, Sandswept Isles, there's an event where you fight 2 of 6 possible bosses at the same time. I love doing that and the bounties.
---
Current Events are back! Yay!
---
Not to mention they monetised chairs.

---
I'm actually seeing more people than ever all over the place.
---
&gt;implying the elite specs arent awesome
---
MAJESTIC AS FUCK!
---
Nope, it's still in there! Check the patch notes if you haven't already.
---
there are ways to get ascended armor but are drop luck reliant and usually need a stat respec so may as well just go straight to crafting or token exchanges.
---
It's extremely dead during the night but that's about it
---
They gotta do that before they can do further adjustments.
---
I’m on with that. They are releasing  second flying mount anyway.
---
Same for me, tried in multiple browsers.
---
But then you still have modifier keys, like shift, ctrl and Alt

This story was created with Twine and is powered by TiddlyWiki
---
The first things I remember: the glare of the sun, the blistering heat of the desert, and my family’s screams. 
---
There are other voices, too. Deeper, guttural, crying out their praise for Palawa Joko as if the lich could hear their devotion across all of Elona. My mother and father, my sister and my brother—they hurried me out the door and into the vast desert with only my mother's rifle and a small bag, heavy with ammunition. Too heavy for a child, but not nearly enough for what lay ahead. 
---
They told me to escape to Amnoon. Made me promise I would survive.
---
So I ran, and their screams became one with the desert winds howling at my back.
---
I fled north through the Scourgeway, through the Desolation and away from Joko—whatever that meant in Elona. Then I hit the Bone Wall. Nobody could sneak through the gate without going through at least three dozen Awakened...and these weren’t the mindless boors that wandered through farms and villages, scaring up support for the lich. These ones couldn’t be fooled. Couldn’t be reasoned with. If you tried to slip through the gate with a flimsy excuse or poorly forged papers, you didn’t go to prison.
---
You were killed on the spot. 
---
I saw it happen as I was summoning the courage to try my own luck. The poor fool stumbled in front of me, insisting he had permission to cross with a small group of farmers working the Elon Riverlands beyond. The guards showed him no patience, no mercy. Maybe he was part of the group. Maybe he wasn’t. 
---
It was clear to me that I’d never get through on my own. I was trapped, wandering the Desolation.
---
-- That what I could Copy Pasta
---
*shrug* My control setup lets me keep moving just fine. You know you can use modified keys like ctrl/shift/alt for mounts too right?
---
this is all I care about, please don't be a 2-300g+ raw gold sink
---
Don't you mean West, when South always has to help after we one-burn? :D

---
I never said it takes skill. I just said if you are unable to get dodgejumps done consistently you're just so insanely bad at something that doesn't require skill you're better off being quiet instead of assuming other parents mirroring your family structure.
---
it's map and time dependent but generally I've seen solid map populations, enough to run just about any meta especially the recent ones from LW.
---
Next :
---
I’m not sure how long I hid in the Desolation. I was alone with forty-six bullets left in that heavy bag my family placed in my hands. Some wild game lasted longer than others, but once I was out of ammunition...that was it. I needed to escape through the Joko Gate.
---
There were rock gazelle, of course. Sand eels and devourers—though missing a shot meant drawing their attention, which was dangerous. I learned not to do that.
---
One particularly desperate day, I even tried making a meal of a sulfurous ooze. The less said about that, the better.
---
If any of Joko’s Awakened found me, they needed bullets too. But that was a waste. I learned to hide from them.
---
When I wasn’t out hunting or trying to plot my way through the gate, I was left alone with my thoughts. All of them about the family I’d lost and everything that had been taken from me.
---
There had been the farm, chores, target practice in the morning—the routine of a simple life. A life that wasn’t mine anymore.
---
Of course I wanted to mourn. Of course I wanted to grieve. But I couldn’t. To grieve would take time. Effort. I couldn’t waste it. I needed to survive. I needed to move on. I needed to get to the Elon Riverlands, to the Crystal Oasis, to Amnoon.
---
It would be thirty-one pulls of the trigger before I’d have that chance.
---
PANIC AND BLAME EAST
---
You're still moving when you dismount. Often I'll use the raptor to jump right to the tip of a ledge, tap my radial menu key to dismount, use the little jump to get a bit of extra height off the edge, and tap the radial key again to mount the griffon. It's a much smoother transition than I could imagine doing if I had to hit those keys on my numpad, and can save me in places like the Verdant Brink from being pulled into fights I don't want to get involved with.
---
Also, while I technically could do it with one button, I find the radial menu helps a lot with re-mounting quickly in the middle of WvW skirmishes. I just need to put enough space between me and the enemies to break combat (while holding the menu open) and release the button the instant I see the icon open up. Releasing a mouse button is *slightly* faster than pressing a key, and sometimes those few milliseconds make the difference between getting pulled back into combat by a projectile or not.
---
I should probably note that I play exclusively in action cam mode, so I'm already used to being significantly more agile, but less precise than players who don't. I also have bindings set to shift (dodge) and ctrl (stow weapon, swim downward, AND mount action 1) so I can't really afford to put anything I might need to use in a chaotic setting on key combinations involving those two.
---
I have a feeling that the new mount will fly like the bee in super adventure box,"1" and "2" keys for altitude and "W" for flying forward
---
A mount that can "actually fly" and climb walls? Seems like it kinda makes the springer and Griffin more niche (almost useless depending on how long it can climb/fly?), Though I'm guessing that with all this ability it's going to make the griffin's crazy quest look easy. And Anet did a pretty good job of balancing previous mounts so I have high hopes.
---
Come on, need a video.
---
 There was a vision.  
---
A promise—that we'd win.  
---
My god is dead. Aurene, gone. The warmth of Balthazar's spirit is now just cold, lifeless crystal. Kralkatorrik took her from me, just as his Brand will soon take this world.  
---
I thought that I had finally found...something. A hope that what I was holding on to was real. That it was pure and good.  
---
Maybe it was.  
---
Maybe what I had for that short time between my lowest point and the end of all things was as good as it will ever get for me.  
---
Or maybe the vision that saw me standing there at her side during the final
---
It's also in BL chests if gambling is your thing. The BL chests right now are particularly tempting because they've also added Chaos weapon skins again
---
Better yet, stop making new mounts. Only mount we really need after warclaw is underwater mount. Skyscale isn't bad but largely unneeded, just filling in small gaps that could have been done by adding a mastery or two to griffon.
---
I'd rather they improve mounts from here on out unless it is to add an underwater mount (no I so not think they should make the skimmer an underwater mount).
---
I was gonna gamble, but I had 400 gems already (thus making me not have to spend 30+) and I'm not one for glowy things anyway. Just birds. All my characters look like NPCs.
---
i wonder if upgraded gates and walls also had their health increased to offset the increased damage received.
---
The PvE meta-build is Greatsword, Scepter / Focus. 
---
Dragonhunter is a bursty multi-target dps with some utility like reflects, stability and aegis which makes it a great choice for dungeons and fractals.
---
Side projects (games I guess, we will never know) would be more profitable (if they were eventually released) for them than fixing the game. It is known truth. Only handful of people will actually buy gems with real money as thanks just because devs fixed some stuff.
---
It looks more badass and useful than the Gryffon, so I doubt that, unfortunately :'(
---
This is how they get you - though through previous experiences I got the mount way before I hit the 2k mark with BLC
---
If they revert the nerf on its movement like pof launch everyone will use a lot more over the sky scale for sure.
---
yeee,marketing is good..... :DDD
---
You need to have the episode unlocked, presumably. Meaning just logging in during the couple of months the episode is live.
---
Yeah, I'm well aware that I'm suckered in. I probably will not purchase another single mount skin for this much again, unless it is another birb, because birbs are my weakness.
---
Cant wait for gemstore mount packs to only have half the mounts in the game and the rest being standalone.
---
Is it just me or the wings are a bit small....?
---
Yeah fucking anet being boring as fuk adding dragonmounts bring dungeons back and buff silverwastes
---
Why would the Skyscale make the Griffon obsolete? It'll come with its own advantages and drawbacks. The Rollerbeetle didn't make Raptor or Jackal obsolete either. It will cut into the "market share" of course, because there will be situations where the Skyscale will do better than the Griffon (if not, it would be a useless addition), but this will be offset by disadvantages.
---
The Skyscale is slower than the Griffon, but it can gain altitude and clinge to walls. Long range high speed traversal will stay the Griffon's realm, but the Skyscale will fill a missing niche at best, that being able to gain altitude above starting point and thus being more maneuverable, basically.
---
In fact, the Skyscale probably is an augmentation to the Griffon because you'll be able to gain dive-height with it in places where you previously wouldn't be able to. Either way, the Griffon has no forced use cases outside of the adventures, which are optional content as well - it is kind of disconnected from the main game unlike all other mounts. It is a luxury and the Skyscale should be seen as the baseline air mount.
---
There's no Rytlock like Skrittlock.
---
Depends on what parts IMO, finding a raid in the middle of the night can be hard and WvW obviously suffers apart from night raids as well. But that doesn't mean that I dont run into tons of people in open world.
---
Hes talking about the bug where your mount is literally inside the ground. Happens to me and all my buddies, especially on the Raptor. If you're in AB during the looting phase and you go from chest to chest you usually get the bug once per room. Its incredibly annoying, if you watch your minimap you still move and once the game spawns your mount you'll teleport to where you moved to, however if you dismount before the mount spawns it rubberbands you back. It is neither hardware or internet related, its purely on Anet
---
Ich bin ein Skyscaleiner.
---
And just for a moment I thought it wouldn't be a purple weapon!
---
Just now, Door in Garni T3: 2% per ram hit....
---
Using the painty style more to transition into in game footage would look really slick to me.
---
Sea Cucumber mount, where we ride by hiding in its butt like a pearl fish.
---
Hmm... HoT meta warning device.
---
Clarify what you mean by "night." On NA servers, 5:00 pm EST (2:00 pm PST) through 11:00 pm EST (8:00 pm PST) are considered "peak hours." After that, people peter out slowly, but I wouldn't consider the game "dead" until the wee hours of the morning.
---
Players: "give us dervish"
---
Anet: *gemstore package*
---
Players: "give us ritualist"
---
😂😂😂
---
RIP springer.
---
I made a prom queen guardian with an epic resting bitch face, it was pretty great.
---
Hummingbird wings kind of are.
---
As a new player you should get the Copper fed Salvage-o-matic, the top quality of life item for your loot managing.
---
This one basically guarantees that you get materials for crafting runes and sigils, not the best, but decent.
---
[Arctodus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Arctodus)
---
Mmm ritualistic outfit.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
One of the best skins imo:-)
---
Keep construct enrage mechanic will now pull an emergency way point that is pinged in team chat.
---
It was concept art, which is just that, a concept.
---
OK so I got this and I noticed a "click" sound like I swear someone must have clicked a mouse while recording the SFX for this. You can hear it at 40-42s, 52-56s, etc. It's really loud and driving me crazy!
---
they should make CGI trailer like ff/eso/wow
---
people know the game wont look anything like that, but it still excites general public
---
I'm playing for two months now and my total gold is 49. :D
---
I sell all I got and don't spend anything except for salvage kits.
---
I know from other MMOs gold is easy to come by if you have spent enough time on maxlevel - so I guess it's patience!
---
thats pretty good to know! i know the exotic specialization weapon you got was character bound, so I was just wondering. 
---
thank you for answering!
---
I know what is autohotkey. I asked how do you use it in GW2.
---
Yes! A ritualist outfit!
---
*It's the basic version instead of Luxon or Asura.*
---
&gt; the group mount was just too good of an idea to scrap
---
No, it wasn't. It was silly concept art that luckily appears to have been dismissed.
---
This would be great as a mastery skill!  I was kinda thinking the mechanics of this mount would also work really well in HoT maps if you don't have all of the masteries there, or you don't want to figure out which jumping mushroom will get you where you want to go.
---
Finished reading it, was actually a pretty good story. It def explains Zafirah a lot more to say the least.
---
I’m looking forward to Caithe.
---
I just tested it in PvE and it works just fine for me.
---
I had it on my rev when I loaded it, tested, boon were still pulsing. Changed the trait, bons were no longer pulsing after a facet had been activated, put the trait back and it went back to pulsing for 6 seconds after using the active skill.
---
Could have easily had a FLYING SPIDER MOUNT.
---
Anet, you disappoint!
---
No problem and good luck on getting ascended!
---
Hmm, yeah as a two month old player it is definitely going to be harder to get gold as easy. Just keep chugging though you will get there!
---
flaps faster when you hover on the skimmer
---
Making a power soul beast, I am currently using greatsword and sword/ axe. I am seeing some builds where they use dagger/ axe, the main hand for dual wield is only for AA right, so wouldn’t using a sword deal more damage when compared to a dagger AA.
---
it also really helps if you like daily fractals.
---
I really hope E6 is a proper finale as well - and not one prevented from being a proper resolution by some cliffhanger or tragic twist or new teaser or something, like basically every end-of-chapter since they started Living World has been. We've been dealing with more or less constant rising action since the beginning of S1, and if the decide to try and raise the stakes even more at the end of S4, despite us being at the point where not dealing the the big bad ASAP will result in reality itself basically imploding, I think I'm going to lose my mind.
---
Not anywhere with platforms or with particularly rough walls.
---
tyvm
---
RNGesus has blessed you today, congrats.
---
I need that skimmer skin.
---
Shark.
---
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.
---
The prevailing argument is that the latest episode will require a flying mount, so they had to give one attached to the episode since they can't count on the entire playerbase having a 250g mount
---
true. Fractals and Raids - no need to spend money on gear, either. It just keeps flooding in
---
Yes, and next week episode 4 will be free. Last week it was E2, and E1 the week before that. It's part of their welcome back events they've been doing
---
I like the idea of a real flying fish, but I also like that the 2k skins are often a completely different mesh/species, so while you're getting the same functionality as the skimmer, it's almost a completely different mount. (Same with the gecko/rabbit, firegoat/jackal, lionbird instead of birdlion, etc.)
---
Why not a radial like the one in gw2 pvp. Where you vote for the mount you want and it picks a random one
---
I like gliding shrooms, they’re tiny and cute
---
This is the real win
---
It's a bit early to draw a conclusion like that right now. I'm guessing the altitude gained isn't as big as a trained Springer, but you could top it with enough time and energy regeneration. That would be an acceptable middle ground I think.
---
That would also mean that the highest and fastest point you could reach would be with Springer (full charged trained jump) &gt; Bond of Faith &gt; Skyscale (ability). Maybe.
---
Just so you know, in order to keep the rng system balanced, you have lost all your good rng for the foreseeable future. 
---
(grats!)
---
Isn't this old? It only mentions 5 raid wings...
---
Lf rusher to ascalon 5k
---
I love the convenience items. I have genuinely appreciated the "oh hey, this is happening" nature of the portal one specifically. HoT and PoF ones will likely be more useful cause their metas can have low pops and more meaningful value.
---
BUT... I'd really like things like portal devices and books to be able to be thoughtfully consolidated in some way.
---
I agree that the humming bird is different than you would think, but it just doesn’t work biologically. 
---
Humming bird makes more sense for the gryphon because... you know.... it can fly. You saying “basically” the same is like having a raptor skin but as an elephant. They are both land animals. 
---
Very different:
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_fish
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batoidea
---
I presume it's going to be "here, commander, use one for this mission" and then for normal pve world you have to go through quests/gold to get one
---
Who would?
---
Apparently I have invisible bags. Did not know that. Thank you so much for your time.
---
/r/guildrecruitment
---
that's like saying "with hexes not existing Mesmers wouldn't work in gw2 anyway"
---
I had put them ina a invisible bag. Thank you, you are very kind!
---
Does anyone know if theres any rhythm to when old 2k mount skins come out on sale again? I really want the armoured raptor and the gecko springer skins but I was short on money for both at the time D:
---
So, same thing for me. 
---
 Last night I got my first Ascended drop ever, and today, I get the skin. I killed my rng from here on out didn't I?
---
I'm well aware of reusing the assets in order to cut the time needed to have the enemy design finished lol, i just meant overall it isn't a bristleback, so i'd just rather not have people getting false information about it as an enemy
---
Spyro is back!
---
By the way, I saw this far too often in the past: Try not to use old footage too much, specially the ones containing the old sylvari models. The game has a lot of newer cinematics you could extract scenes from!
---
One day... one day, I will know that feeling too.
---
Hopefully for the Mesmer you targeted a clone instead.  
---
But seriously: Mesmer | Glamour Bard.  The fabulousness is baked into both!
---
A seahorse would have the best meme value, but practically speaking I think either a dolphin or something a bit more high fantasy (which would fit with all the other mounts we have so far) would work better.
---
Oh gawd, those wings are way too small, doesn't look realistic enough for immersion imo. Won't buy it just for that - sad :/ The rest is really cool "unfortunately".
---
NORTH!?!?!
---
In what world is the griffon locked behind a **grind**?
---
Congratulations!!
---
Nope, that would be too map breaking.
---
This sounds bad.
---
I get that it's real easy to break out of maps already, but it makes the game look cheap and unprofessional.
---
Now we're going to have a new mount that is essentially a "Break out of the map free" button. And new players will have the option to rush for it, and probably will because new mount (Happened with the Beetle). Lot's of people's first experience with an update is going to be one that let's them break everything.
---
I hope it's either locked to the new zone for now, or they've been secretly working to redo every single map in the game to make it compatible with this.
---
I have them on num keys so far so good :-D
---
These look amazing. Shame there's no axe.
---
So thats were all my luck went! I opened 25 yesterday, and did not get a single unc ._.
---
Gz though :p
---
No wonder they won't solve the bug when the current solution requires you to buy stuff from the gemstore. Scummy.
---
Thank you! The sceptre looks pretty snazzy. I’ll never use it, though.
---
But they have the mythical ... *break bars*
---
Not sure if they fixed it, but going on the widdde outskirts of Dragons Stand is pretty fun.
---
Glad I'm not alone. Total care bear decision making right there.
---
I'm running out of keys to bind to mounts!
---
Is it just me or is the account endpoint unreachable? Says internal error...
---
You'll still make money.   I had over 2,000g just before I made my second legendary armor set, and I don't do much other than WvW these days.
---
After a few years, it was more efficient to throw tomes at your keyfarmer to level up and get more skills to use.  Might as well use them if you had stacks just sitting around in storage.

---
it's been discussed too many times to start the argument again. For some people it is a grind, for others it's not - if you don't find it that way, good for you :)
---
Out of context that sounds like someone turned the physics off.
---
Indeed. Ulgoth is such a fascinating character who could've had an entire living world episode if not season devoted to him and the struggles of the Centaur Alliance, but it's nice to see his foreboding words come true in the most unexpected of ways. :)
---
The multi-person mount is THE prime example of people hyping themselves to disappointment. It was never more than a concept art they showed when they talked about creating the mounts and the techs.
---
And auto reconsume as long as I have the same buff food in inventory or right click violet item to consume. anythink that improves the current situation.
---
The newly buffed Scrapper is actually a solid support spec you could look into, at least has some level of damage to go with it so open world doesn't become infuriating
---
Right where did I say that it was the living world team who created the mount you point that out and I'll happily accept it. I just said the new mount is being introduced by the same team that introduced the beetle. Did I say team 3 designed it no because I believe the beetle was already being worked on I simply point out that I like the idea of a single team being the one that bundles a mount with it.
---
I have z for raptor, ctl + x, c, v, b for jackal - beetle, and ; for the general Wich is set to griffon.
---
I think I've seen 50, but it does not go on sale often. Once a year *maybe*. This may be the last sale until 2020.
---
Has absolutely zero use besides rp-ing and making lazy people even lazier. It is something that GW2 does NOT need, nor should ever have.
---
Wrong.
---
Now I think its possible with cyberscorcery like arc templates. It actually access our inventory and reequip stuff. What if we could make an add that works the easiest way possible: giving us a shortcut to use item in certain inventory slot. Let's say we define bag 1 and first X slots. Then add small floating indicator what item is under which slot so we don't have to remember it. Finally, customisable shortcuts to each item.

Oh god, this was hilarious! This is so great! Thanks for sharing all of them with us! This is my favorite so far. So unexpected!
---
It has its own animations too, pretty nice.
---
[wiki entry dedicated to it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming), season to taste.  I run a human noble rev just because i like running mace/sword rev and noble story is fairly fast but more laid back to play through.
---
OH. MY. GOD.
---
Thanks! I didn't expect my super rough pen sketches would bring someone that much joy but I'm glad that it did!
---
Do they all take 5k damage or 16k damage
---
Those are dope, thanks.
---
Not when they shadowed the previous elite specs.
---
I miss the daily and monthly achievements :(
---
Bringing them back with a few that are training/mechanically focuses would be really nice
---
Is that a cockatiel hippogryph?
---
I love it.
---
What purple mask?
---
If it’s any consolation, you probably will never have to use the Springer again when this new mount drops, so you can just give it that hotkey.
---
No, it isn't. The central mechanic of Dervish was applying and removing enchantments on yourself. Mysticism worked like that, and 76 out of the [dervish's 87 skills](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_dervish_skills) are either enchantments themselves or interact with them. The only thing you'd get in GW2 would be the visuals (and since we have armor skins based on weight anyway, your dervish would not even look like one).
---
Word. Perfect balance is a pipe dream, let alone something you actually want. Good balance is promoting a couple viable builds/strategies/whatever at a time, and rotating different things between viability.
---
I like it when you're playing defensive, goose
---
I really appreciate the intention of these vid but tbh they look pretty dull and attractive as compared to a trailer that they made 9 years ago : https://youtu.be/YEdr8HHJ-zU the narration, the locations of the home city they selected were more attractive than this
---
you should probably write wich region you are in :)
---
Nope
---
Shh, I'm just memeing. WvW still makes you money, but at a much slower pace.
---
That is a humming bird sound. Doesn't sound like a click sound to me, just a soft chirping.

**East commander:** MAP IS FULL
---
**West random:** West has 2

**South random:** Anyone at north?

---
from what I understand they are spawning at specific places on the 7 maps listed in the collection. After scouring brisban for quite some time I found a lot of people waiting on a spot at gnashar hills so I guess it spawns there.
---
I hope not. The Beedog flight is way too clunky with a lot of rubberbanding.
---
You should really make at least 5g every day you play by just doing dailies and an hour of whatever content you like.
---
If you play more than that or like any of the high end stuff like Fractals, you'll make a lot more. Even if you only play 2-3 hours or so.
---
I don't get it. The most gold I ever had was just after Halloween last year. It was enough for a commander tag with maybe 80 left over.
---
How do you make all that money? Do you just like, play all day or have you got some voodoo going on there?
---
Boo hoo spamming siege from a t3 structure is slightly less effective.
---
Also, nice English.
---
I knew it! I had a feeling they were going to add a new type of flying mount, as it seemed to have a different flight pattern than the griffon we're used to.
---
makes me think a sidegame would have bene called Guild Wars 2 : Legion
---
Pls wait for me. Lol
---
"Guys, I took a guess of one scenario out of a few. You're welcome."
---
same, oof.
---
Please give it to me.😳
---
Condi fb easily gets 10k dps or more in T4, which is way more than the average pug.

I've never been able to get the hang of that. I find it's basically gliding with a slower altitude loss (although I firmly believe they've sped up the alt loss on griffon since launch)

Poor choice for skimmer.

I have hummingbirds here during the summer and they are ANYTHING BUT sedate hovering birds (think more like kamikaze divebombers...)
---
more skins to buy in the gemstore instead of earning them in game how exiciting!
---
&gt; And I, unlike **this rather specific subset of kids described**
---
-&gt;
---
&gt; What's it with people thinking that **every kid today** is a Fortnite-playing maniac with ADD who pays no attention in class?
---
What's it with people making weird leaps of logic?
---
And why are we even talking about advertising towards kids? GW2's philosophy specifically caters to the casual playstyle of adults with less free time on their hands but more money, thus it would make sense to develop ads that attract *them*.
---
gw2 radial makes it super easy tbh

---
very odd timing to release that ritualist outfit, maybe they want us to start thinking about cantha?
---
I have never had such a need for a mount in a game before. It's a freaking dragon.
---
Though, from the video, it kinda looked like it was sharing some animations with the Griffon ? I hope that's either placeholders or me just imagining things, because that would be a little disappointing.
---
can we sell them?
---
I'll have a look at my mats, maybe I do have some gold potential there.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
80% of the people at south don't know you need to use knockbacks/pulls to move it.
---
I for one am grateful for this change.
---
Hmm. I should try that. I did a lot of pvp a few years ago and it was fun and made me sone decent gold
---
So... can I expect new mount packs to have 7 skins in them?
---
Well we both don’t know until we get it (since we are speculating), but I don’t think you will have anywhere close to the same speed on a griffin as you will on the dragon. Probably the dragon has no dive to gain speed at all. It will be slow flying
---
Its something you need to do fast, even the Joko portals are ridiculously hard to get done and that was the last one released. To this day I haven't gotten the Southsun Cove joko portals event completed, and I've tried 6-7 times.
---
This + Dread mask = best "Meta" Ouftfit .....maaan I do miss my Ritualist
---
God this is so accurate lmao. Whenever i go to AB i always find myself having to comm tag up on West coz nobody else will.
---
That's not the kind of paywall they meant. Yes, they could have used a more precise word, but from context you could have easily understood their meaning.
---
Lovely to hear. Pass that along to every group in LFG now, thanks.
---
The PoF maps are nice insofar as they're easier to solo the HPs and whatall, but the sense of progression in HoT is unparalleled, and those maps are *gorgeous* both visually and in terms of design.
---
Who dced?
---
Kessex Hills, Brisban Wilds, Lornars Pass, Iron Marches, Diessa Plateau, Dredgehaunt Cliffs and Snowden Drifts
---

Looks surprisingly good. It's so much nicer when Anet just lets horns clip instead of shaving them off.
---
Open your eyes.
---
Zybbo already tried to ask, I dont understand why you need to involve autohotkey. From what I understood you use numerical keypad to summon mount. For example press num 1 to mount raptor. Why do you need AHK for that?   
---
I feel like there is 90% change that I have totally misunderstood what you are saying :D
---
is gw2efficiency working for you?
---
when i add my key i got
---
&gt; This API key is invalid, has corrupted API data or the API can not be reached.
---
This is most commonly caused by a browser extension called "Privacy Badger".
---
Error reported by the API: "ErrInternal"
---
A game that you buy once and play forever, with new content added all the time and they dare try to make a few bucks from skins...how dare they!!
---
barely any1 forces you to link your gear even in pugs and 3rd party gear checks are forbidden by anet
---
i love the idle emote wherein it hovers side to side
---
Amen. This change is honestly a godsend, especially to roamers.
---
&gt; power staff only
---
&gt; power GS only
---
I dont care what you choose as a class to play. Weapon swapping is a huge boon to game play and so much more fun (imo) than camping a single weapon set. Especially on warrior where you can have a 5s weapons swap instead of the regular 10s. Plus cc is a thing thats useful and GS/staff have zero cc.
---
Just when I finally got griffon
---
\*Unsheathes credit card\*
---
That's some freaky shit
---
Three weeks, eh? I'd say that lines up quite nicely with the "Episode 6 at the end of the Welcome Back event" hypothesis. Well, happy birthday to me, I suppose.
---
It's not about coverage of a lack there of, it's about how you genuinely do not have a single group that will fight organised 20+. Sorry!
---
Is it just random or???
---
&gt; 2% sure
---
So you are claiming that you called it... while your calling of it was pretty strongly implying that you thought you were wrong...
---
Do you smell toast?
---
Yeah, it's so hard to make that it had to be made as a 3rd party addon for free long time ago.
---
In a open world and story enviroment you can run any class with any weapons and you will be fine.
---
You can right click on the mount button at the end of your skill bar and it opens up the mount selection menu and you can go from there. I dont use radial mount menu because this is a (so far) a good route for me.
---
This would be the loudest boi
---
But Griffon can't fly :'(
---
So to complete the achievement you need to close the portal at least sixteen times? Haven’t seen anything on how to precisely craft the weapons either
---
They are exotic, accountbound
---
Does it matter if its the Hilt or the other part of the weapon?
---
is that the same game?
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/majiDave/videos
---
Yup. Part of me wants them to start over, make gw3 and create a newer more modern engine.
---
But thats a total pipe dream, especially now.
---
for the sword, you need the hilt not the blade
---
I...actually would love if Necromancer got its own version of Ranger Spirits, maybe freeing up Druids/Rangers from Spirit duty?
---
It's probably designed that way, which is why it gets a longer burn than the others.
---
But then you have to take your hand off the mouse. I've been fine with shift+1-7 so far, but 8 is out of reach. We need a better ingame mount selection interface.
---
This needs to be stackable with the normal one :(
---
What about the scepter?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusZXECS0mM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusZXECS0mM)  This feels pretty relevant.
---
wow that is crazy lets hope roamers spam those zergblob movements oh wait there are no more roamers cause mounts ...
---
The trick to having a lot of gold is not spending gold.
---
Eh... whatever. Feel free to assume what you want about what other people assume, I guess? Not like one voice will change anything anyway.
---
If these ads attract anyone - the game will get more money which translates to more content, and all players win. If they don't, NCSoft will hopefully get another pass with their broom, and we'll start getting ads that *will* attract money, and players win a bit later. If the game changes its core philosophy and artistic direction - some players will just leave earlier, which will be unfortunate, but really unavertable by any forum warriorship. And if that next time the game just shuts down... then so be it, and those who made decisions that led to it will, hopefully, bear this mark on the rest of their career.
---
I always go south. Can confirm accurate.
---
There's at least half a dozen possible ways for her to "come back" using just our current lore understanding. Foremost is that we know Glint died but multiple live characters have interacted with her in the mists, and since Kralk is in the mists, and we're almost certainly going to face him again, it seems unlikely that we won't encounter Aurene there. My main point is that if they wanted to bring Aurene back, they could easily do so. Hence, we can't rule it out.
---
If you are only ever going to get one of these then Runecrafter is probably the better option since it is a bit more balanced between all the different things you want out of salvaging.
---
They're unofficial, and you want to make sure that any you use isn't breaking the terms of service. The devs have weighed in and tentatively approved some addons - you can typically Google or ask in a relevant thread if it's been okayed by Anet. But there's always a risk that they will change their minds for some reason. The GW2 Radial Mount Menu discussed here is probably one of the safer ones, since all it does is provide a visual interface for hotkeys.
---
have you tried the blade?
---
the recipe worked for the sword
---
So mad dude. Lol
---
Damn my boy Gendarran Fields don't have the rifts.
---
When I saw it I for sure thought it was a griffin skin. Very surprised and excited the new mount :)
---
One of the masteries could be the ability to launch up the sky from the ground. It would be amazing
---
&gt; The multi-person mount is THE hyped one we've all known about since PoF launched. 
---
Citation needed.
---
My current setup will still work with the new mount, for now. When PoF came out, I used a nice range of 5 keys that were free : F6-F10. New mounts since then go to altGr+Fx corresponding to the closest existing mount. Pitey altgr+F6 (speed), Warclaw altgr+F9 (4 legs land running and dashes), Skyscale will get altgr+F10 (flying). That still leaves 2 free shortcuts for future mounts (altgr+F7 for anything that jumps or has big ears, altgr+F8 for anything water related)
---
Stack up your golds boiz cause it aint gonna be cheap!!
---
Thanks, my formatting was intentional :)
---
okay i'll try it a different way
---
You're an asshole for saying that someone is probably "kinda dumb" and implying that they just can't process key-combinations.  There's no reason to interpret anyone's comment that way and your comment contributes nothing besides helping you feel a little bit superior to someone in an unjustified way

---
&gt;## BLACK LION TRADING COMPANY GEM STORE
---
&gt;### **Bug Fixes**
---
&gt;- Fixed a rare server crash caused when players used the Earthshaker Mining Tool immediately after loading completed.
---
I just switched to adding shift to my regular mount bindings so its not too bad. Though its a bit hard remembering where each mount is, and I had to use Insert key next to PrtScr which lead to quite a lot accidental screenshots.
---
content we pay for
---
That could work too but I think the more likely result would be if they are good enough then raid groups will want both the rangers spirits and the necros spirits.
---
I mean, it'll be pretty low dps compared to other builds doing their rotations right, but other than that it's decent dps for any content for the effort put in.
---
From what I saw with Beetle most people initially try it out and revert to Raptor. I was like this too until recently when I had to learn how to ride Beetle better for the races.
---
So if its easier and faster to climb distances with a Springer, people may just revert to it for convenience.
---
&gt; have a side numpad config
---
Sometimes I miss how cool my old [CM Storm Inferno](https://i0.wp.com/www.itechnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/CM-Storm-Inferno-Gaming-Mouse-angle-views.jpg?fit=457%2C337) looked and how comfortable it was in my hand
---
And then I remember the shitty button layout and I'm reminded of exactly why I bought my logitech G600 back in 2015.
---
WANT
---
yeah raids are great too if you join a static, which is what I've been doing for years.  But the time wasted organizing raids can really hurt it, so if your planning to pug I think fractals are much better than raids.  But raids also don't require AR.  Maybe that makes it a bit of a wash.
---
I remember reading somewhere that Anet had planned on designing a spider mount for wall-climbing and the like. Once they’d finished animating it though, it was so realistic half the studio loved it and the other half were mortified. 
---
Imagine running around, suddenly seeing a zerg of people on giant spiders run past you. I don’t think Anet wanted to alienate a sizeable portion of their audience due to (sometimes severe) arachnophobia.
---
That's an awfully moralist way of seeing it. If someone calls and objectively faster and easier way of doing things "tedious", there obviously has to be some sort of deficiency in that one's cognitive capabilities. Stupidity of inexperience itself is not what bothers me, but unwillingness to try out new things is and should be condemnable, for if he had actually tried using ctrl/shift/alt-combinations for commands, he'd realize how much superior they are against having same amount of commands strewn across unique keys.
---
Could anyone explain/show me a website where it is explained how power, precision and ferocity work?
---
For example, I don't know why my dragonhunter should be running with a full set of berserker's gear , while it is better for power chronomancers to use some  parts with assasin stats.
---
You forgot the fact you can convert gold to gems. So that if you don't want to pay real money or can't afford it. You can just earn the gold to buy the skins. (That's what I did before I had a job)
---
I could be partially merging with it.
---
You Kurzick are so lame your trees killed themselves because they couldn't bear that many hugging!
---
I don’t use any addons and it’s fine. Just key bind what you need
---
I'd actually give props to Anet if they did something like that. But I doubt it.
---
The Forge has always been... special; sometimes you have to put things in a particular spot, or order, for it to work sometimes.
---
Thanks. That actually makes a lot of sense. Either make them tougher with the same HP or add HP and make them take the same amount of damage. Hopefully they keep an eye on things and consider changing HP numbers if structures get taken too quickly.
---
I loled
---
Agree. PUG Fracs &gt;&gt; PUG Raids
---
I see no issue. I’ll get 20 of those boxes before I get a BLK
---
Better start to save gold right now xD
---
You forgot "Waterfin"
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Mounts are supposed to be only to engage (start) encounters, not actually taking an active part in them. They won't do sth like you said because it is against their rules when making mounts.
---
Explain me why people should use your mount when they you basically use other one and be not dependent on you? Multi-person mount works in games like ARK but GW2 is totally different.
---
How you know all this already lol?
---
That scepter has my attention!
---
easy to work when there's not really much of a work_load_
---
he will be interested again but not to this extend
---
Used to be 6-7s so yea it probably is the price
---
Why does this imply sarcasm? It means you can make a little silver from them dropping, why should that be a negative?
---
He's my favorite by far
---
pretty much....
---
kingfisher would have been a better concept for the skimmer....
---
I mean, you can buy gems with gold...
---
that thing wouldn't either, with those wings LOL (they are way too small xD)
---
I hope this device increases the possibility of tier 4 verdant brink. Pact reformer has been tough without the population we once had in these maps.
---
Remember her eating joke was part of the prophecy?
---
 Makes you go hmm
---
Druid or Banner Warrior
---
Good thing we just got 7 new events that reward players 3 new weapon skins with effects for participating, plus the glowing purple mask at the end of the month for making sure you follow their newsletter. All of these are absolutely free. Sorry we got 1 new skin in the gemstore today on the game that doesn't have any subscription fee.
---
I see no issue with the release of mount skins in both RNG &amp; single purchase options.  When a skin is RNG *exclusivey* with no hope of a guaranteed way of acquiring it then I take issue.  But they have addressed that as we with statuettes on a feat.
---
You mean like the weapon and armour skins added every living world episode?
---
For raid you will currently usually always want 1 Druid. For regular T4 (so with a healer) you can currently go for Chrono + Druid or Firebrand (power) + Renegade (heal). I think Chrono + Renegade could work too but it feels a bit redundant but unfortunately no healer support really works on its own completely, especially for Fractals because you will want all the important boons and damage modifers you can find.
---
If they come out with a dolphin mount my daughter will have a melt down.  
---
She was totally devastated when the underwear ranger sprites (that are dolphins) stopped following the ranger character.
---
For Gliders and Mountskins - yes.
---
Anything else is just fine. I simply don't buy things that I don't want to pay for. It's that simple. There are some nice skins out there with a lot more value than the items you could buy from the gem-store. I can't complain in my opinion.
---
me too. i'm willing to put up with a bit of downtime if they'll be adding features to it though :v
---
With you now at 10,000, a perfect score has been accomplished and now you're not allowed to earn a single point from this moment on. You must stay perfect for "us".
---
Thats not the reason, shill. Outfits are cheaper and faster to make so they milk them instead. Player feedback is meaningless in that matter.
---
Because I use a 6 button mouse and a Razer Tartarus with all keys already accounted for. AHK lets me bind keys I already have access to so that I can quickly mount without having to move my hand to another device.
---
which is why I always explain the mechanic when doing any meta.  It's good to assume you have a bunch of new people and explain it as such.    Only once have I had someone get annoyed at giving the info before the fight, why I'm not sure.  They falsely and arrogantly assume everyone has done it before and knows the mechanics.
---
With closer inspection, this really does look like a Aurene + Joko fusion...
---
Source?
---
Thanks! Are there rewards beyond armor skins that transfer to GW2?
---
Your mom
---
Very unpopular, because you're WRONG!
---
yes. dragonmounts are boring and silverwastes is "the content" to do and needs to be more rewarding.
---
i do wonder how many hints people need to spot sarcasm.
---
This creature is absolutely glorious
---
As far as I could tell no one and as you can see at least 3 people were still actively playing.
---
Lord was attempted at least once though.
---
Been working on a Daredevil "Bard" character that will use the Orchestral Staff.
---
It's going to be ugly as hell, but I am compelled.
---
Please stop posting.
---
All it took was losing a pound of flesh.
---
I have no idea what the title has to do with the clip but the only thing I see is that instead of using immobilize you are actually hard ccing the pride which makes it walk faster.
---
Vice-versa, it looks like Skyscale needs a foothold on the wall. So many places will still be unreachable by Skyscale, while reachable with Springer. Think of a platform shaped like a T - Skyscale won't be able to climb that.
---
Grow up? I work over 50 hours each week, and pay all my own bills. Just because I cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars for gems or hours and hours farming gold doesnt mean im a kid.
---
The Rev trait draconic echo from the glint traitline makes it so the facettes only apply their boons once on activation and once on the actual use. Not having the trait selected diffuses the bug. Happened in WvW
---
Is there a way to track how much kills you made per day in wvw?
---
Episode 1: 2 full weapon sets, 6 rare weapon skins and 1 armour piece.
---
Episode 2: 3 backpacks, 4 rare weapon skins, 1 armour piece.
---
Episode 3: 2 backpacks, 1 armour piece.
---
Episode 4: 2 full armour sets, 2 rare weapon skins.
---
Episode 5: 2 full weapon sets, 2 rare weapon skins, 1 armour piece.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
And that's not to mention legendaries, minis, tonics, gizmos, skins added through festivals, the 3 new weapon skins added today and the design-a-weapon skins added a few months ago, and all the new skins obtained through raids.
---
It's not about your metrics, it's about your attitude, kid.
---
That's a mask of the old movie character "The Creature From Black Lagoon" (a literal swamp monster) which is a hilarious choice for a corruption hearing. Even w/o getting into current american politics, that's just funny.
---
Who is zafirah? Only unknown character coming to mind is that deadeye sniper in the story who kept destroying me in that cemetery place.
---
Player feedback caused them to focus on outfits?  My experience is that players always have favored individual pieces to allow mixing.
---
Witnessing the things some people do in ranked (and falling prey to me and my bot 'friend'): yes, he could be worse. By a lot.
---
I 100% agree and I'm sure a lot more people out there agree too. I worked hard for the armor pieces i have collected. I'm boycotting outfits to stop this ridiculous money grab. I understand it makes them more profit but it is not a solution. Waiting 2 years for an expansion to obtain another what... 4 sets of armor which 2 are just (upgraded models) doesn't justify this. 
---
Customization is what this game is about. Not being tied down to wearing an outfit that we still cannot change the head gear like we did in Guild Wars 1 (at least)
---
if that's official, it's desperate and depressing
---
That means it's better to wait. 
---
As there's only 3 weapons, people will eventually craft them all and the prices will drop.
---
Chill out man
---
Thanks for this
---
They removed armor sets from the gemstore due to player complaints and preference. Three full six-piece armor sets times two genders times 5 races is a lot of clipping issues to deal with (sorry, Charr). It is, in fact, 18x more work than a single outfit.
---
Since people wanted them as in game rewards and not gemstore purchases, and it was/is too time consuming to do both, full armor sets are now only added as expansion content, like warbeast, bladed, etc., or as progression very late in living story seasons, like luminescent, requiem. (Season 3 got a legendary trinket instead.)
---
Where can I see the roadmap?
---
That's amazing!
---
You've been in social guilds or rather regular ones, focused on some type of content(pve/pvp)? Because best way to look for friends is to join a social guild, meet some people and hang out with those you like.
---
Another vitamin D outfit :D
---
what exactly are you wanting to see for "free"?  The living story episodes have been coming with weapon and armor sets that are obtainable in game.  I think you're just salty because you want the hummingbird for free.
---
They didn't remove them. Those which were created before outfits are still sold on rotation. They stopped producing armors on large scale, because outfits are cheaper, therefore faster to produce and monatize. Player opinions don't matter. If they did, there would be gliders or mount skins available via gameplay.
---
I have no goals tbh
---
Definitly Official :-)
---
?
---
You make me sad

---
I'd there a roadmap released by anet and where can I find it?
---
I've always disabled mode shifting completely on my G600. One mode has been plenty for every game I've played.
---
In GW2 I have my weapon skills on keyboard keys around my WASD (Q E R Z X), heal, utility, and elites on the first two rows of the G600, and mounts on F1 etc.
---
One of the better cosplay I've seen on this sub. I usually groan at the sight of them for how low effort/quality they are but this is really neat.
---
Hello everyone  
---
I know this question has been asked at least 1 million times but I truly can't find a class that I can dedicate my time on... And before you say why not all of them, I made all 9 classes but now whenever I want to play I just keep switching classes like every 10 minutes and I don't play at all.. just wasting time on switching and endless thinking.  
---
First I tried Guardian and I liked it in PvE but disliked it in PvP so much.. I disliked how low health they are too.  
---
Usually in all games I go with 2 mains.. a warrior and a mage. ( swords and magic are my favorite fantasy theme )  
---
Here's what I want : A class where I can focus on both PvE and PvP and viable on both..  
---
And I would like to focus on damaging my enemies not supporting my allies and still have decent survivability
---
No idea if that's still cost-effective, but *goddamn we got the prettiest art and I'm happy more people can see it*.
---
All.
---
No, I simply prefer to base things on actual provable facts and evidence, if you refuse to supply those I will simply assume that what you say is bullshit.
---
Your comment is exactly what you were expected to post as reply. Thank you :)
---
No, just more nostalgia dollars (I am so here for them though)
---
I kinda wish you sat further forward. I'm not sure if it would look better but it seems weird to be sitting basically on the tail feathers. Other than that I think it's amazing.
---
About 7 years late but hey its progress xD
---
Any mouse with back/forward buttons are useful for mounts as well. Combo those with convenient left hand keys (and combinations of those keys) and no one should be running out of mount keybinds anytime soon.
---
Get the copper fed, it’s much more useful for general salvaging. Regarding shared inventory slots, you’ll get one with each expansion you buy, but will need to use the level 80 boost before it frees up. I’d recommend making an alt to use it on, and continue leveling your main as normal.
---
&gt; it’s much more useful for general salvaging.
---
Why is it much more useful though? It seems to do the same thing no?
---
Yayyy! I loved the last All or Nothing story. Can't wait to read!
---
I mean, [ESO seems to think so](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1iCf8KX4AAkivy.jpg). Plus they can still do both online and street level marketing.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Monk and Ritualist classes/elite specs pl0x.
---
I've been playing hard for ages and still have tons to do. I'd wager the only ones having a hard time finding things to do are the top 1% or so, if that. If 5000+ hours and 35k AP can't "complete" the game I doubt much else will.
---
Anet employee just posted officially they have more than 11 milion players. That's interesting news and since he's here I asked him a question :)
---
I mean I hope he's not lying while representing his owners.
---
&gt; I don't see a problem.
---
I doubt things will make it to t3 nearly as often, which will bring out the low-scoring, nearly even matches. Depending on who has more time-zone coverage.
---
I use almost copperfed for green and everything below.
---
Silverfed for yellow rare.
---
Exotic black lion salvage since I have some on bank.
---
Yeah, I use sceptres all the time. I was meaning I’ll likely never use this skin.
---
I've been critical of the price point for some of the expensive one-off skins.
---
**This** is a 2000 gem skin should look like. My socks are knocked off.
---
&gt; Eh, not when there's no means to get there quickly. That one base is literally without a supply route.
---
One word solution: Waypoints. :P
---
&gt;The Rata Primus gates were destroyed and everyone who knew how to make them killed as far as we know. The tech hasn't been re-established.
---
The tech actually was already there. We won the Snaff prize with it. 
---
&gt;By argument of non-asura teleportation method, Flame Legion also has portals, and charr have been shown to be more than willing to utilize magic if push comes to shove, so other legions may be capable of making similar portals if Flame could.
---
That's true, but we don't really know what these portals are able to do. We have no real informations about them and none of the portals we can see/use have a long reach. 
---
Also I wouldn't say the other Legions could use Flame Legion portals, the searing cauldron or other magic stuff that easily. The other Legions barely have any shamans, while the Flame Legion are full of them. But the Flame Legion could use them, even if they don't fight together with the other Legions, they have to fight at some point. 
---
&gt;Except that such "armed and armored" golems are experimental. That's my entire point.
---
Putting them into a armor wouldn't change their software. However, in case of a war the Asura would work together to create good war-golems, not like now where every Asura/Krew works alone. Technological progress are way faster in war times. 
---
&gt;Tzark doesn't transform people into ghosts. He just covers them with ectoplasm. Pretty huge difference.
---
Technically yes, but he was still seen as a ghost, as one of them. 
---
&gt;And Tzark isn't able to convince the ghosts to do anything other than they were already doing
---
We can't know. I mean making them rage isn't that hard. And if they know that the Charr are under attack, I think it's possible to convince or provoke the ghosts to attack. 
---
&gt;Besides, that only covers Ascalon, which I established in my initial post is merely 1/3rd or less of the charr's total territory. And it doesn't even cover all of Ascalon, especially since you have to convince each ghost individually.
---
Having an army fighting for you in 1/3 of the enemy's territory is still a huge advantage. And you only have to convince Grast or whoever is the current leader / highest ranked soldier, since Adelbern is still away. They still follow orders. 
---
&gt;Fun fact: Saurians existed in charr lands 250 years ago. So did hydras and other highly annoying beasts. They're no longer there.
---
Yeah, I missed Hydras in Ascalon. They were really annoying in GW1. :P
---
All!
---
They are worth it for the convenience factor although with unid gear change that should be less of an issue because you could just batch most of your salvaging while you are next to a merchant.
---
The primary advantage of the Runecrafter is that you will get more charms and symbols in the long run than the other kits.
---
In comparison to the copper fed it cost 10x as much per use( 30c vs 3c). The 200 gem difference breaks even after around 18,000 items salvaged.
---
In reality you should already know the answer to this question. Just ask yourself how often you find yourself running out of salvage kits.
---
How long was all of this even planned?
---
Videos, posters, this didn't start with NCSoft intervention.
---
Now we only need expansion and not just LW (unless season 5 actually brings something interesting (Elite specs, wink, wink)).
---
You'll understand if you read it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAGnKpE4NCI &lt;3
---
I bought the Runecrafter's :)  I don't run out of kits often but the convenience is nice!
---
I stopped playing few month ago, so don't know about rune salvage kit. But copper fed is simply much cheaper to use than silver fed. Yes, after buying it for gems, you're still paying to use it.
---
Anyone else being ported to completely random maps, with completely random rifts? And no, the "If you do this rift, then the third rift in line, then take the fourth derivative of the second rift in line, then observe the angle between Polaris and  Alpha Bootis on June 5th" crap that people are making up doesn't work either.
---
You get ported to a completely random map.
---
I saw the headline and thought OP meant Lion’s Arch and that ANet was selling virtual ad space.
---
White and blues being the lowest rarity should mean that these will be the ones you get the most often. If you salvage these(and some of the greens without any upgrades in them) with a runecrafter you are wasting 27c per item.
---
So more useful because it would be the one that gets the most use in an optimal scenario.
---
Yep. It's completely random
---
The problem is that the "gem reward", is awarded with one boss... not with the meta map. So people kill matriach get the gem and then left.
---
pls dont be as expensive as griffon.

I've played dozens of MMO's over the years and GW2 early-mid game is easily the most enjoyable MMO experience ever. 
---
I quit because back in the day there wasn't really anything to do other then farm reputation (which is/was just a number for bragging rights) or grind months to get legendaries (which had the same stats as easy obtainable exotics). So I just hope there's something to do now.

.... what I thought of after reading all the other replies to this comment is, “whatever your great-great-great grandparents wore is no longer in fashion so we spiced it up for your character’s renfair/Victorian ball/re-enactment/history buff con. Style &gt; authenticity amirite.” 😂

I was wondering how they turned so awful. Turns out the *real* Balthazar wasn't quite what they thought he was. Particularly in a bad mood.

This opens up a huge number of possible skins.  Really jazzed to see what they come up with.

I don't have one either but I bought a cheap wireless one, works like a charm.

For some inexplicable reason many people think the abbreviation for 'advertisements' is 'adds' instead of 'ads'.

Probably the same issue as 'could of'.
---
Well, we do know there are horses in Tyria. Just nowhere in the maps we can visit.
---
My personal theory is that charr go crazy when they see a horse and eat them all, like a decapodian with anchovies. 
---
And so you will never see horses in any area in which a charr can go, and that includes all player characters.
---
You pick out words and put them in some other context in which i have said nothing even remotley close to what you try to make out of it. How do you expect me to respond to that? 
---
The only thing i can respond to is the fact that i do not have one alt account. I have a alt account on all servers in EU except the national servers. This way i can see with my own eyes what is happening in WvW instead of listen to others telling me their truth.
---
Another outfit with a man skirt?

No elonian elementalist outfit? Booo I've been waiting for that to come back.

Ooo what if thats what it is. Because she ate em she gains his immorality and comes back as that, and you just get her as a mount so it works with the story?
---
I've been going with CTRL + Z, X, C, V, B, N, and Space, personally.

Shaders are already on medium. Otherwise there would also be a bright white light coming from the right.

So make black character

South is normally one burn

Thanks for your constructive input.

Not really, but I'm apparently getting to that place where I'm not in on all the latest memes. Though I will give you I was cranky this morning which is totally an old man thing to do.
---
other thread exists and got a dev response, fix inc asap apparently
---
Sorry, I have no power over fixing anet mistakes like your whiteness, so I work with what Ive got
---
Do you get the immediate port to the location like the core Tyria one? Only benefit I would see in it. I use the core one out of sheer laziness and boredom sometimes.
---
Please. I want a shader and postprocessing update so much. The rimlight, the glowy skin not adapting to light, the bloom, it all bothers me extremely (and hurts my poor eyes too). If ANet implemented shader and postprocessing options as separate entries that can be turned on/off instead of this scaling blobs, I'd honestly be more happy than with actual build templates.
---
Yes, now im a dovakin

Hi I'm a 3yold player with both expansions, I played all roles, and the only whose I don't main it is engi, any tips for him I wanna play it on all modes
---
&gt;I honestly enjoyed watching this more than their recent marketing ads. This is what's they should do. A video showing lots of enticing gameplay and locations with a good soundtrack. Show off the features and what the game actually looks like now. Even this video was grossly outdated if you think about all the expansion and living world content.
---
I'm glad you enjoyed the video :D. Agreed, I like seeing the Core Tyria environments.  I feel they still have stories to tell in this Post Expansion era.
---
Oof time to sell off my 1250 of these

I wonder how much research went into this campaign. With demographics and interest targeting, along with third party data collectors, it would be interesting to know if this was a strategically planned geotargeting method. Do MMO players, or those who fit the current customer database demographics, visit/live in these areas? I also wonder if they then have a good SEO and SEM team to help complete the customer journey through to purchase... along with retargeting campaigns for those who ended up not purchasing, but viewed the content. Are they retargeting people who visit the areas where they are doing OOH advertising through other avenues such as Display? How full circle is this campaign really? What’s the goal Reach/Frequency?
---
Regardless, GW2 has been in need of some good marketing/advertising for awhile. As a fan of the game, and an advertising professional, it makes me happy to see they’re dedicating funds to advertising. I just hope it’s thoughtful and supported by data and good strategy. Pretty posters will only do so much at the end of the day.

she is next.. im kinda worried how much of a heart beaker itll be. caithe was all but physically attached to aurene through the whole thing. something tells me its gonna be pretty freaking sad. shes lost foalin, the trust of the commander and pretty much the pact, and now aurene. itll be interesting to see how she move son cause she doesn't have very many strings to grab for support right now.

Still no bug fix for thiefs shadow trap, I see

The coolest part is that it has some custom idle animations too!

I don't use the skimmer... But I might buy it...
---
This has been in the works for about a year and is a full 360 approach, similar to what would be utilized for a “new release” campaign. We have done full segmentation and testing in order to hopefully amplify awareness with some OOH and flashy videos plus performance based targeted online media to hopefully close the loop and drive players into the game.

**Gambler's fallacy**
---
The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.
---
The term "Monte Carlo fallacy" originates from the best known example of the phenomenon, which occurred in the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913.

This post itself is part of the campaign. the OP has a lot of red flags for being a marketing account (posting history entirely deleted, has only made this post and a comment on another post about the ads). In this post and the other, anethogm is responding near-instantly to comments as they appear (e.g. [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bber9t/check_out_the_cool_ads_in_nyc/ekic2ra/?context=10000), but any really)
---
Did you just repost a post from 30 mins ago
---
I mean... that's life. And that's storytelling, too.
---
When someone you care about in a story dies, THAT'S the impact. I don't know why people are so convinced that everyone gets to fulfill their "great purpose" before they die, or that doing so is the only thing that made their lives meaningful. It's disgusting and cheap to reduce a character -- or a person -- down to "did they do the thing I needed them to do before they died? no? well what a waste".  The other characters cared about her, She impacted them in various ways through the relationships she had. That is not meaningless or useless.
---
The writers aren't telling a story about sunshines and rainbows. They're telling a story about war, and in war -- even moreso than in normal life -- people die. I think that building up this idea that Aurene is our only hope, and then destroying that only hope, is actually *fantastic* storytelling, precisely because people don't expect that to happen. Fiction often relies on some really convient tropes, and it would be refreshing to see a story actually tackle the "what happens when the great prophesy/last hope/etc. doesn't work" angle, instead of falling back on the same old tired, predictable pattern.
---
He's a tomato.
---
Gotcha!  What I wasn't sure was to tell which are not used, but easy to tell, thank you.
---
Z = Default mount (usually Griffin for midair recovery)
---
Shift-Z = Springer
---
Ctrl-Z = Skimmer
---
Alt-Z = Jackal
---
Ctrl-Alt-Z = Raptor
---
Ctrl-Shift-Z = Griffin
---
Shift-Alt-Z = Beetle
---
Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Z = Warclaw (will change to Skyscale)
---
I still consider myself new to this game and wish more people would do this, or even just ask (even more so in the expansion maps). Heck, I'm happy when someone yells out cc.
---
LOL thank you!  You reduced my GW2 load time from 10 seconds to about 3!  Only hiccup was, while I was mass-deleting I actually accidentally removed Reshade.fhx or whatever it is, but replaced it and now only 7 affects get loaded!  Loading up 50+ shaders that I wasn't even using was taking up a ridiculous amount of time.  Thanks!
---
This is one of the top theories out there right now
---
Mount skin went into the chests so a bunch were bought.  On top of that they have been speculated on in the past.
---
Not at all. Git gud at precision clicking like me.
---
anyone know where this is in NYC??

I was thinking the same as well. Thank you &lt;3
---
Yes
---
*Yes*
---
^(*this pleases me*)
---
Fingers crossed for a release date soon!
---
One of those giant whales from frost gorge sound please!
---
If very few are defending, is it really fair to let them hold onto the objective? Might as well lock objectives to only allow them to flip during peak hours then? 
---
This change won't change very much, it'll just make the taking of objectives less tedious. If a server has 2 people on, they'll lose the objective in the end. It just makes attacks less tedious, and hopefully will draw more aggressive siege fights.
---
Not bad, should say "Nerf Warrior Please", though
---
can you portal me to the zones, too, pls? :o

Now i want names for mounts like pets do.
