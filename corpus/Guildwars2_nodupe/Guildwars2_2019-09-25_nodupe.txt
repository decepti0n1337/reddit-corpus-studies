I don't really play Charr, but that's like the perfect Charr backpack.
---
---
---
wow..... chill out.
---
Right, thanks for the input and help! Might I ask if you're knowledgeable about Mesmer in that regard? Only thing I know is that they have the Mirage for condi while I'm unsure about support or power specs.
---
Really depends, they answer tickets in the order that they receive them. Even if the same person has two tickets, they have to put that 2nd request on hold til they get to it.
---

---
A big patch came out not too long ago and there has been a large amount of new players entering the game so they might have a large amount of tickets.
---
It’s can take anywhere from 2 - 5 business days.
---
Mood.

[Boon chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) is meta on nearly every raid (complements a firebrand/renegade comp or dual chrono, isn't taken on boon thief fights). Support chrono has fallen out of favor in fractals (for the aforementioned firebrand/renegade comp) but is still sometimes seen in pugs. There is also a power DPS chrono build you can run in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) and [raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/). [Condi mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) is great in raids (top DPS on many specific fights) but like I said before, not wanted in fractals.
---
Are you mainly looking to get into fractals, raids, or both? Were you looking for training?
---
Like a week, think of how many people made accounts back when and they made PoF and HoT purchasable together a lot of people forget their passwords. If you’re patient and provided adequate proof of account ownership,shouldn’t be too long. I lost an item on my account and it took them a week to respond. But after that replies were only a day between.
---
I'm surprised it's come back so many times, the other 2k gem skins sure don't have this rate of return. Too bad I still can't afford it.
---
Is it bugged in the sense that some items will not count towards the achieve?
---
Huh, she dropped Warrior tomes in GW1? interesting.
---
It isn't. Not anymore. *Sad chrono noises*
---
If you look back at previous releases as well as the release day threqds here e eryone feels the same way. Its egregious how much shit he VA's with the EXACT same voice
---
I don't know how to use Taco, but if someone wants to add this to it, I'm sure it'd be a great help to many.
---
Sam was most likely following direction for what they asked him to do, if it was definitely him for all of the other voices.
---
I wanna get out of the buttcape train, please
---
I got it as a drop im the first 30 minutes of the release and later realized that it can be bought for 60 gold
---
I found the answer. Apparently it’s a bug with the newest Win10 update (shocker) and task manager doesn’t show GPU usage when using d912pxy.
---
Though if you personally had to pick between those two which would ya pick?
---
Just let me buy the hat, what the hell Anet.
---
Agreed. I did hear exactly the same thing and they could have put a little variance in it.
---
You never played Skyrim, have you? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All jokes aside, i noticed in the german version with the nobles around Faren´s Flyer WP in Verdant Brink while cleaning up old archievements i didn´t yet have. The Nobles trapped in the vine cocoons are all voiced by him, regardles of gender too.
---
[Technically it's not skin so it's perfectly safe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Starborn_Outfit)
---
Entitled? Stop being a cuck. I want a realistic and fair way to gain the items in the game. 
---
The item is too fucking rare. The drop rate is broken. Get a clue and stop defending a company that doesn't give a shit about you and just wants every drop of cash they can squeeze from you. Jesus.
---
Because Anet is afraid of the beauty of a charr in speedos.
---
At least we don't have to salvage them anymore. Shoving sharp-looking rocks in my mouth is way more convenient.
---
Didn't they change something after they released the recharging tp to friend? 
---
I remember someone posting about bloodstone fen key farm back then.
---
Scheduling, contracts, etc.
---
It's not possible to have limitless voice actors for everything, you've have to make do with a certain cast.
---
Warrior is the default profession in GW1. If it was saved as a numeric value, it'll likely be "0".
---
So anything that doesn't have its profession set to anything else in GW1 is usually warrior.
---
In GW2 it doesn't seem to be like that. Player professions are special, and give players profession mechanics (F1 skills).   
---
When the profession is changed to 'default' the character won't have any profession mechanics.
---
bud wheres my raid training
---
Really up to you then on what you want, heal ren is the better healer choice in exp groups since the FB does more damage as boon but FB can carry some groups hard with it's healing and blocks. IMO I'd gear power DH first (with the option of FB) then get the heal set for both ren and FB. But again, all up to what you like :)
---
Korea Got
---
I will rededicate my life to this game if my Charr could wear speedos. I just hope they go gender-neutral and no top.
---
Cheap voice acting.
---
You can tell they don't even put effects on his voice for the Charr. When Blum voices Rytlock, his recordings are processed to hell and back.
---
Reminds me of the hawk men from the flash gordon movie
---
Try to get as many people as you can. It will greatly increase number of Charr for the achievement. It starts shortly after devourer event at ranch and towards west from there.
---
literally what dozens or hundreds of people do
---
Commence fixed-wing flight operations.
---
I mean...braham and more or less all charr are autotuned, so I would assume it's the audio department more than sam.
---
So ugly. So, so ugly.
---
“Objectifying” What a horrible word. 
---
How could we possibly objectify a completely fictional character that we choose what they wear? Oh the horror! How will people sleep at night knowing that some people chose to dress their characters provocatively!?
---
Commanding can be done with any class, I recommend playing whatever you are most comfortable on. 
---
The main reasons ppl tag on a fb:
---
\- it is the slowest class -&gt; everyone can follow
---
\- it has the most access to stability and cleanses for your team -&gt; everyone can follow
---
\- it heals allies, so they can follow :)
---
If you tag on other classes you may have problems with ppl being able to follow you :) especially on warrior engi or thief witch all have good personal invurns with high mobility. 
---
Personally I had my best experience following a scrapper, and commanding on necro, both classes me or the commander were playing for a long time. 
---
You can even command on something squishy if you can trust your team :)
---
blizzard also have a lot more to work on than anet do, they have overwatch, wow, diablo etc. anet have quite a large team, especially considering the amount of content that goes out, 250 people, it doesn't really feel like 250 people are working on gw2. an engine rework is *definitely* possible, they just don't appear to have that many people working on gw2, if they did we would be seeing content for all areas of the game rather than casual pve, they are likely still holding back a lot of their employees on stuff they haven't announced. you also have to keep in mind how many non devs are employed by blizzard if you are looking at their numbers of employees, just a few months ago 800 were laid off in ireland (i think) and those were *all* customer support or non dev positions, which probably means that there are similar numbers in the US and other countries, if not more.
---
Just out of curiosity, how (if at all) do they block all the mini explosions that come after each swing?
---
I still dont have a class I've truly fell in love with yet.  Been playing for 4 years.  
---
Started with pistol/pistol engi and he's my PVE character since you could easily switch kits for swiftness and the sneak gyro past enemies.  Hes now my node harvester.  
---
Guardian is my dungeon/fractal character.  Super easy to learn, fun but still missing something.  
---
Warrior is my new main.  Axe/Axe and I've been playing him since PoF came out.  Stupid damage and fun but still not all there yet.  
---
Also have a Mesmer and I think that's my favorite to play but I cant really choose how to play him.  Very much disliked rev and ranger. Necro is my WVW minionmancer.  Have an ele with a staff but its meh.  Have a thief but also meh.  Idk I should try mesmer more.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I have checked the Known Issue Tracker several times hoping for mention of this, but I guess the KIT isn't being updated any longer.
---
Impact is 3% consistent (same as all default slaying sigils) and then boosted to 10% every knockdown, stun, or nearly every defiance bar break. If you are in a specific fractal or dungeon the mob specific option will always be better since its just 10% 99% of the time. That or using the night sigil in night time instances ([list here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Day_and_night#List_of_zones_not_on_cycle)).
---
The voice actor does a heap of minor NPCs around Tyria and they've never stuck out to me as Braham until this map. Leads me to assume that he could have done a good job changing his voice enough, but whoever was giving him direction didn't let him know to do so.
---
yea, you are overthinking it
---
the reason the traits don't make sense is because WP is not a good theorycrafter so his build is simply bad
---
i mean imagine picking illusionary reversion instead of either of the other 2..or that random well of recall! complete nonsense!
---
While I would love to see GW1 with revamped graphics, wouldn't that make a kind of disconnect between the actual technology and the surface appearance?
---
It's like how I felt about Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. The graphics were incredible but the cutscene rigging was exactly the same as from the original, so it still felt really stiff. I feel like, unless they *totally* overhauled the game (like Halo 2 Anniversary did), GW1 might suffer the same stiffness.
---
And even if it did get that total overhaul, I feel it just risks alienating the loyal playerbase even further.
---
Maybe it's just best being left with that *classic* flavor, low poly and all. It's still a really beautiful game after all these years.
---
Personally, I consider animation to be part of "graphics". I suppose not everyone does, though. Like you say, high graphics with poor animations is jarring - and can easily fall into the uncanny valley.
---
A lot of GW1's animation's pretty good, mind you. It's mostly the cinematics that's poor, due to how they made them (using standard gameplay animations which doesn't really fit cinematic style). But if they bring the textures and shading up to EotN's quality, and cinematics' animations to the BMP's quality, then I think that's revamp enough all around. This would, of course, require redoing the cinematics from scratch as devs have said that they can't just fix one or two things during cinematics.
---
And really, that's all I truly had in mind (well, maybe bring the shader quality a little higher like what that_shaman recently did with his character model in blender).
---
As for alienating the player base - as far as I saw, everyone *loved* the improvements graphics got where the cap on resolution was removed, allowing higher quality textures and further distance draw to occur. I don't doubt there'd be similar praise if all the graphics and animations got some improvements, so long as that's all it is. Especially if it's just bringing everything to the Bonus Mission Pack's quality. I also doubt there'd be dislike towards redoing some voice acting (-coughFactionscough-).
---
And for the record: I don't think polygon count needs to be altered either. With only a small few exceptions, GW does pretty good job there.
---
They're actually pretty good about responding, I've never had a response take longer than a day
---
Taking the idea of objectifying seriously, I think proponents of that rationale believe that when you apply stereotypes of sexual, cultural, or social norms in fantasy, fiction, or art, then that will bleed over into the real world through subconscious infiltration of those biases.
---
Therefore, to put it bluntly, to prevent objectifying in real life, we must prevent objectifying in fantasy, fiction, and art. The same goes for any other immoral act or portrayal by such reasoning.
---
I think it's a bunch of hubaloo because the argument breaks down between art reinforcing immoral behavior. Unfortunately science hasn't proven such a correlation. So until then, I'm going to dress my female human as a slut.
---
"Major *story* content release" Uh huh...
---
Damn it you beat me.
---
the datamined stuff wouldn't glow anyway
---
There's no evidence that humans reached that far north.
---
That said, the Catacombs of Kathandrax was of dwarven origin (or at least, it's the tomb of a dwarven hero who battled a charr invasion; I doubt the charr would bury their enemy in such esteem). So we know there were legit dwarven ruins in the region.
---
So overall, my guess is that the ruins were originally intended as being of charr origins, with some Ascalonian spoils, or dwarven origins. But as I alluded to, such was never written internally it seems.
---
Just don't make a new ticket with a new question or to add something.  It will put you at the bottom of the queue again.  Just reply to your open ticket.
---
A good spike build can spike you off your warclaw, yeah, I've had it happen more than once. xD
---
So whats your point? That is pretty standard procedure in most games with a high charakter model count. Exceptions are few and far between
---
Too late for me :(
---
I feel like you might need to chill on the vitirol haha
---
I mean, we sort of already know that due to past trends
---
The problem with this one is that even though you get more of it than any other LS currency, you also need it in larger quantities.
---
Ah dammit, thanks for checking though. Was thinking it might have been each tier 3 helmet and a pile of chillies.
---
This is also what I thought of.
---
play with camera shake on. come on man pay attention
---
So many good headpieces in the game, designers had to cover whole head bcs of this issue and resulted in bad look sadly. Think about possibilities otherwise if designers would not be limited by that.

I think the living story home instance nodes are a great deal.  I have a maxed home instance that I harvest and as a result I never grind out these currencies, I just wait.  I have somewhere between 30-40 full sets of ascended for my characters, and a large amount of the trinkets have come from these nodes.  Armor/weapons of course from raids and fractals.

We will eat the chilis to stay warm in the cold!
---
Yes, so essentially the same argument as, “Video games cause violence.” Which isn’t backed by any reliable scientific study that I can find on Arxiv or Sci-hub. 
---
All in all, dressing my characters in a scantily clad outfit, isn’t going to make me think the real life variants are objects. It’s quite silly to even be having this discussion.

I am annoyed because I wouldn't have bought it from the vendor had I known it could drop.

Calling it now, Sam Reigal is assimilating the game.  Soon there will be no more Guild Wars 2, only Sam Reigal Wars 2.

We are Sam Reigal. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will become Sam Reigal. Resistance is futile.
---
Big Bang Theory is one of the biggest shows on television, and yet its "comedy" mocking autistic people is still shitty and offensive.
---
thank you! So glad I google searched and found your thread :)
---
I think the only possible arguement that could be made is that they're controlled by different parts of the brain, and therefore potentially affected by different stimuli. No clue if any of that's actually true in this context, but it would admittedly be pretty cool if it was.
---
Sam Riegal also voiced Phoenix Wright and Starscream. His voice isn't monotone, he probably had directive to hit those lines that way. Blame Anet, not Sam.

It's because it needs a API key

Is there any reason? Yeah. To save money and cut costs paying other voice actors.

The armour is protecting the crotch! Super protecting! We guarantee it'll deflect 100% of blows aimed at the crotch.
---
They are to someone who is almost entirely ignorant to the subject matter as I am. ;)
---
I've searched my university library database, which access to like every academic platform out there, and still have yet to find any real studies supporting the claims of video games causing violence.
---
I do remember reading about a study that showed a general correlation between player skill and how sexism or something though.
---
Other studies have shown that there can be increased aggression, but it also was not in the way that lead to violent behavior in any form.
---
Pretty much, while potentially malicious individuals may be attracted to gaming, the game itself does not cause people to become malicious.
---
Even studies on VR demonstrate that, while often storing an experience more as the memory of an actual "place", the brain can still quickly recognize the difference between fantasy and reality. In other words, no, violent VR games still do not make users more inclined to behave violently, despite actually performing those actions (but it can make you a better table tennis player in real life apparently lol).
---
i have never seen a gpu referred to as a gc, that was new to me.
---
&gt; However, I would love to see the classes I think meant for tanking, to be able to be meta. 
---
It is guild wars 2, there are no classes who are "meant" for sth, thats why u can heal with necro, ele or support with a thief.
---
Also it is already balanced, mesmer got enough updates already. If you dont like mesmer as a tank, play something else.
---
yes BUT if it's not an official retailer (see list [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical)), then you run the risk of your account getting banned down the line, so buy at your own risk
---
So true, and gw1 was full of sexy armors. I feel like gw2 has more revealing amors for males than females somehow.
---
Why not? Hentai wars 1 was great.
---
There should be a ticket about account action or something that explains why you were banned.
---
What's the hardest fractal in your opinion?
---
I mostly join PUGs, and am often surprised how people can play T3 and still not know how some boss mechanics work. The most blatant is siren's reef with the shark. I explain it *every* time before the encounter and invariably people will run away when the shark is on top of them, it's exhausting.
---
Power Chrono! You can find it on the snow crows website.
---
What I don't understand with outfits and those hats making you bald or covering you up entirely is... why don't they just make them with a default hairstyle that doesn't clip with it? Give it the colour of the character's hair or make it dyable as another part of the outfit, boom, problem solved.
---
I totally agree with you!  
---
Had so much trouble with the wings and I just did not got them right without changing the whole artworks composition. But as it was just for a header contest I gave up at some point cause I've been running out of time :D
---
This game is really good at providing checkbox achievements. It's not necessarily the most challenging, though some of them can be (gold ranking on several adventures can take a few hours to a few days of practice). Unfortunately a lot of them can also be tedious like "kill 1000 mobs" or " complete this event 100 times"...
---
What overlays in windows 10?
---
I'm just saying. A LOT of the armor in FFXIV is pretty open on females, plus the men can wear bunny suits yet nobody bats an eye. I see no issues with it in guild wars.
---
 Something ice related would fit well with the theme of the saga.

Can we agree that Obsidian made wars look like teapots?

---
I'm at 41% map completion on my main character since ... forever.
---
And Steve!
---
hahahaha!
---
Did they not help us kill the dragons?
---
It would be available from the moment a new player picks their order. But i see what you mean by our champion having to rank up in titles.
---
The ideas really centered around the daily missions for them, i got the idea when I was thinking how great it would be if players could discover new lore in game themselves and naturally thought that would be a priory thing.
---
As for the dailys, they would be small instances on existing maps, just like how the story does it.
---
If you didn't take a picture of the screen with your phone, did you truly finish map comp?
---
Never seen a mmo that can control clipping. Hats and big hairstyles just do not work together therefore or let's say it would take too much work.
---
There's way better outfits to accomplish that goal.

---
Right on the topic. I yesterday just finished another worldcompletion aswell using AugTyr. However, I found some features of it a little clunky and so I sat down and upgraded certain features of it. Such being (all follow mode features):
---
- The reach radius of nodes can now be adjusted in the settings and will now react when being near a node instead of being right on top.
---
- It is now possible to rejoin on a path when skipping a node and coming near another node being shown down the path.
---
- The path forward being shown is now at least x nodes and max y length which allows the showing of tracks which have huge distances between nodes and works well with the rejoin feature.
---
- There is now a backtrack feature which shows the last x nodes reached with length y in green transparent (depending on node) color which aswell preserves hint texts and such.
---
- A couple more minor adjustments.
---
Having said that, all the above features arent commited to github yet as I first wanted to reach out to the developer and me not actually planning to release them. However, if people find this stuff helpfull and have more features theyd like to see, Id surely commit the existing stuff and implement the requested features of you guys. Cheers.
---
You have all the data. You could actually look at it and draw your own conclusions, you know?
---
All you need for this is a single tool: a two-tailed null hypothesis tests on a binomial distributions. If you used that, you'd know that my previous statement wasn't just an assumption, you'd know which wiki editors included cities in their entries, and you'd have a much better understanding of the actual drop rate.
---
And Donatello from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon!!!
---
Thanks for confirming that the bell works. :) Just tried it all over the stage but failed... I was beginning to worry that the bells didn't count. I'll try it in front of one of the charr next time.
---
Yes. Apparently the VIP pass and the warhorn does count.
---
Thanks for the heads up. :)
---
I don't think that it is directly added to your account but rather that you will get a key which you then have to add to your account yourself.
---
Check your mails and the spam folder.
---
Im more curious why it took so long for people to notice.
---
Mercer is the reason I have a few male norn :D
---
they did that before with the swaggering hat so I have no idea why they didn't do that again
---
There can be no more pure a motivation.
---
&gt; Tried the chilies, an anthology of heroes, and a leaf fossil in keeping with infusion conversion recipes and its so far works. Would be nice if anyone had the infusion and could confirm for us.
---
Sadly, this seems to be the missing recipes as the other stat specific t6 fine materials (claws, fangs etc) also work with the chilis.
---
What system you using, if I may ask?
---
Did you redeem the code you get on your account?
---
would surly be helpful
---
there have been hints about a dye channel in backpacks in the code, but it's not really conclusive.
---
For the second point, I've edited my original post  that wasn't clear at all. 
---
I meant like in raids, where after a certain amount of try, you could unlock what you truly wanted even tho you didn't get lucky before :)
---
I hadn't considered that. That might be the truth considering how easy it is to go from short to long "hair" in seconds.
---
See this would of made a sick armour set. Those individual pieces would of been amazing.. fs
---
Sounds like another thing for them to implement.. Poorly.
---
It happens! :)
---
Well, you need to look for training runs etc. there are enough of them or make your own.
---
To be fair, I haven't touched living story in ages (I never even made it through path of fire), but fair.
---
yep, too late, they closed down raids yesterday /s
---
People generally wish to play with others of equal or greater skill level to avoid frustration. You may be able to join a run with guildies, or could recruit, vet and start your own prog group.
---
&gt;playing healers back then didnt feel like punishement
---
?! you realize healers have been broken in pvp since like late bc / early wotlk right, and are still to this day. They just werent viable in vanilla cause shit balance
---
And now you changed topic. And i was very clear about it because you made it precise. You said what people want FIRST. I never ever said you can not go with anything else. I have no issues with druid or tempest or even scourge. It is all fine. But you said what people want first and that is no longer Druid in tier 4 fractals. 
---
And with this i am done. Because i just keep on repeating my self and it leads no were. So i am fine with you thinking Druid is the thing in fractals. I just stick with what i face every day in tier 4 pug groups.
---
Don't Farm. Play Fractals and Raid.
---
Will it require some game knowledge and some effort? Totally. Will it be mind numbingly boring like open world running in circles and hitting 1? Absolutely not.
---
There might be no hats, but plenty of #AssHats lol
---
&gt;There are far more armor skins that you can get in game f
---
and they are all more of the same. For medium armor its varying lengths of trenchcoats with a little bit different dangling bits. Thats it
---
I love the idea of Rastasura! ^(Like... youre such a Bookah, man...) 
---
And now that you said power metal, im pretty sure most Norn would be huge Sabaton fans
---
Why Are they typing Like this?
---
I'm not too far off actually! I'm in the process of crafting ascended gear and my AR is going up steadily. I think I can start to clear the very end range of T3.
---
remember the ugly ass armor we got for owning the core game ? what madew you believe you get something better this time
---
If this was some PvE shit it would be hotfixed within an hour.
---
Doesn't change anything I said. If you want more variety in armor skins, that's okay too. Nothing to do with cash shop verse in game. If you're going to put on an outfit, your'e not winning at fashion wars.
---
its not free considering you had to buy hot..
---
That's awesome!
---
It's a really big change, and you feel the progression as you rank up to 100 and eventually CMs. Enjoy!
---
Been reported here, in forum and in game and yet no fix and people keep on wasting their game time on that reward track. 
---
Could Arena Net please let us know if you are are least on it and that a fix is about to happen soon?
---
I really want an expansion as well but that’s not addressing the issue at all. This game cannot sustain itself off box sales alone.
---
Huh VIP pass counted for me, and charr tank token didn't count for someone else. Sounds about as I expect for release week.
---
i havent had this problem at all since i stopped using vanilla skins
---
I've always felt Daredevil was the fastest elite I had whenever I wanted to do map completion for keys.  Just a non-stop DPS machine that can skip mounting up to cover short distances.
---
So...why don't you have an amulet equipped, and a Sigil of Purity on your shortbow?
---
depending on your skin it could have less details = faster loading
---
I think if we're going back to that part of the world it would just be Cantha and not Canrea (or whatever it would be called)
---
But at the moment (IMO) Cantha does not fit the story, we seem to be going up on the map (Towards the isles of jantir) and not down (Cantha) Jormag is not in/on Cantha, neither is Primordus.
---
yeah but i bought itwith gold anyways to check out the unique sound effects because especially during the first week, i rather spend my chilis on otherstuff
---
that's not how the sub works. it has to be wholesome.
---
I mean, the Pact was there and helped take down Kralkatorrik, I wouldn't say they were totally absent.
---
Braham is secretly a Mesmer; he only plays as a Guardian to avoid nerfs, and its been an illusion all along.
---
Not sure if a typo. Though I'm loving it
---
Not at my computer atm but I’ll post my specs when I get the chance.
---
When I got the achievement I was screwing around waiting for the event to start.
---
I had an instrument out on stage, then when the event started I was booted off and the achievement unlocked.
---
Maybe try it that way?
---
si
---
Strange, I got it last week by purchasing the VIP pass.
---
I had, so I dialed then all. Maybe only one made some issues but I'd rather not experiment, I don't need them anyway
---
&gt; Interrupts =/= CCs =/= Defiance Bar. 
---
Really? Pardon my ignorance but which non-CC interrupts are there in GW2?
---
Someone had Macca's for lunch.
---
All these points are superb, I'm glad members of the community are optimising this. It's one thing I've shared amongst my own discord community regarding world comp to make life easier for everyone. I would highly recommend brining these points to the attention of the developer and/or route maker :)
---
Crashes during pvp and almost every time I've alt-tabbed or used /wiki. Not happening any more! ( and im using old version of dx12pxy )
---
The record as far as ik for speed was the person who inspired me mentioned in my post running 13hrs6min on Power chrono WITHOUT augmented tyria which shows they genuinely had extremely efficient routes and a good memory

It's rather hat-bodysuit. /I felt weird after typing that.

* Charr all agree that Slayer are mandatory for any music collection. Secretly all have Babymetal on continual play.
---
* Humans are always hyping classical music. Secretly only know the ones that were played on Bugs Bunny cartoons.
---
* Sylvari are young and impressionable and will cut you for speaking ill of BTS. Caithe secretly sings only Lizzo and Adele at karaoke. 
---
* Norn are into the Dropkick Murphys. Also secretly into Lizzo and Adele.
---
* Asura are into an indy band and you probably haven't heard of them.
---
No need to implement such a thing. Why? Because GW2 allow you to convert your gold to gems, so you can buy these skins.
---
Instead of running same content over and over again because there's super low chance to get this awesome outfit/mount/glider (which means you can give it thousand tries and still don't get what you want), you can just do the same thing, convert gold to gems and buy your item from gemstore. Easier way and it does not depend on your luck.
---
&gt;we see how exclusive PvE skins look like in grothmar valley. Almost does not drop and therefore is really expensive.
---
Dude that's one helmet skin. The shoulder skin is dropping in price daily because it can be farmed in 10 minutes per day. FFS. Can nothing be expensive or rare?
---
&gt;(Technically we have a glider thats like this, as if I understand things right the fractal legendary backpack gives you it as a glider)
---
We have three legendary backpacks, and all three have a glider.
---
If the commander comes back like Red then we're well and truly fucked.
---
Kind of funny if you think about it considering the character creation allows you to kind of increase the breast and pelvis as Well.
---
I can think of many outfits like stardust and others that expose the skin more Than any other.
---
This aint a issue thought, tbh, they shouldnt worry too much about that. I do have Female characters because i love the look of certain outfits on them and i did on gw1 as well.
---
Its just in my head, my ideal hero is not a random dude but my Female guardian that its not revealing at all but looks badass.
---
So i just think Anet needs to stop taking to much care into this, specially in 2019
---
I said near the end of the post that this already exists but doesn't feel rewarding, meanwhile when there is exclusive PvE content skins, seeing someone that has this, you're always surprised and have some respects towards this players.
---
It's like the Dhumm's chair for example :)
---
didn't say they were, they still have more than enough devs. the sad fact of the matter is that they don't appear to have learned from their mistakes with the unannounced projects, if they had we would be getting more than a LS episode and some change.
---
Yes
---
How is that strange? VIP pass DOES count.
---
Even if we defeat them they'll just come back from another waypoint, truly an immortal foe.
---
Turns out it may have to be the magnanimous bell
---
Mount &amp; Blade has the same limitation.
---
what the hell is this?
---
He was available. Others were not so available...?
---
1 or 2 people from my guild have a nearly maxed out home instance and always ask if someone wants to loot it.
---
they won't ever break even themselves. but if you count in all the profit other guild members have made by looting their instance over the years, i don't think breaking even is that far off.
---
It truly enhanced not just the visual aspect of GW2 but social as well. 
---
I can now run 5 man content on 120+ fps ultra, 10 man content such as raids on 60+ fps, open world and events from 35-140 fps.
---
Made the Character Limit and Detail possible at Medium while still having a smooth gameplay.
---
Without a doubt best "addon" for GW2.
---
Hats are memes and anet doesn't like memes.
---
Do you mean the [Corsair's leggings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_Corsair_Leggings)?
---
I haven't paid attention really but pretty sure in the French version the voice actors are different. I haven't heard Braham's voice from another NPC.
---
The one that I hear on different maps is the one voicing Dumbledore in Harry Potter.
---
An Asura Band who plays electro music on experimental Instruments.
---
Oh, for a second I thought you might want the Commando class. 
---
What would a patch trailer be like, though? Most of the stuff in patches is gem store items that are revealed gradually throughout 1-2 weeks. We already have trailers for the living story so what else would these trailers bring to the table?
---
I thought RiT was dead?
---
Soulbeast with permanent 30% runspeed definitely makes it seem right. Feels like I'm moving as fast as my huge strides would indicate.
---
Did you 2 factor authentication on ?
---
The most important part is that the real enemy is in the chair over there
---
Wait until you find out Crispin Freeman is in the game but only voices backgrounds NPCs
---
*laughs in 7 year old broken events*
---
also, chrono has a lot of blocks that makes tanking rather easy.
---
sword 2, 2x shield 4, distortion...
---
Think they mean the periodic balance patches which come through
---
Maybe a balance patch report on video with detail on patch notes
---
That one was 100% different because you literally could only doing it by spending gold, this one once again you can find, if you want to be a completionist, then you are going to have things that are difficult, what you do is suck it up and keep trying to be a completionist anyways because that's what they do. once again i don't see the point in complaining and making them change something just because people for some odd reason think they DESERVE to have have everything in this game handed to them. if you want it grind for it and hope you get it, if you dont want it then stop complaining that you cant get it and move on with your life. it once again is an item and if you're complaining that being a completionist is too hard, i have news for you, a completionist has to get all 3 of those items in the end anyways as thats what a completionist is, someone who 100%'s.
---
Engineer: boom, lights, shiny, i can do things, I like pianos
---
Depending on the spec, it can do many different things in each game mode. I have little experience in wvw, but I know scrapper is v strong there. PvP? Holo is great, Scrapper isnt bad either. PvE? Don't be clueless, and both can be amazing and are desired (mostly holo, tho scrapper isnt unheard of). The piano comment? It's if you want to play condi engi. It's an old meta by now, but I've seen people still run it and enjoy it. I myself stick to power holo and it's really neat everywhere :P
---
Elementalist? HELL YEAH IM THE AVATAR. also, storms of everything. Also, attempt at piano.
---
Versatile in all game modes as a dps or a healer/support. Weaver is very complicated to learn, but equally as satisfying and rewarding when you do learn it. Tempest is a bit more chill on the button pressing, but it's a very good support and quite strong DPS if you know what you're doing. I run power tempest (fresh air build) and it works pretty solidly in pve. I kinda avoid pvp tho xD
---
Dragon's take forever to draw so I understand that. Mastering the illusion is one thing but structure and anatomy will always be a challenge for any mythical beast. Yet it's a good thing there is no definitive way to visualize any creature.
---
Haha, sadly things similar to that made me stop drawing but it was because of people asking me to draw for them, I stopped enjoying my Dragon's and other.
---
I could attempt my Rose-Faced Sylvari again, Cheek/eyes, ears, being made of rose petals bursting from a stem and thorny jaw. A lot of soft and rough textures to work with. :)  Good luck with your next projects.
---
I already answered one of these a couple of months back and got downvoted because i was tryna sell druid. 
---
so if you like to incite controversy, go for druid.
---
What worked for me was buying the commander tag and organizing them myself, that way you have control over the group and organization in general. Highly recommend that approach.
---
As for the raid encounter themselves, I'd start with escort (first encounter of wing3), it is by far the easiest encounter out there and will unlock you the masteries, after that, wing4 is pretty easy in general (except for deimos), wing1 is also easy (sabetha can be trickier).
---
If you are going to lead your own training make sure you read about each encounter and all the roles involved with each mechanic.
---
Best of luck

Ranger.
---
I named my favourite animals after my two cats.  I don't use any guides, but I find I'm pretty good at pvp with a poison/fury/beast oriented build, at least enough to stay competitive.
---
Greatsword and Longbow make a cool adventurer/lotr ranger look.
---
Sigils were handy when I first started out because of decent passives/less actives - initially enjoyed it as I eased into the game.
---
Hahaha I had the same thing happen to me once! I believe it was Mount Maelstrom. Fun skimmering across the bottom and looking up
---
Oh cmon, then every weight of armor is varying length of some chest template with extra bits. That is extreme generalization. There is a huge variety of looks you can have within medium armor.
---
I prefer the [Legion Jetpack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legion_Jetpack) backpiece/glider. Same feel, less obtrusive. Flames can be made bright or almost invisible with certain dyes if preferred.
---
Have you tried to repair your client?
---
Best gold farming method = don't endlessly grind and focus exclusively on getting gold.  You'll burn out, and leave the game again.  There are definitely certain activities/maps/metas that will net you more gold in a given period of time, and you should include some of them.  But if you don't enjoy them, then I wouldn't consider them a good use of time.  I don't have the link handy, but there is someone on here who has recently compiled a boatload of data in a google sheet with gold per hour for various maps/metas/gathering routes.  I'd suggest looking at that to guide some of your activity choices.
---
Nice. I was fairly sure the guy telling 10 hours for world completion easy was full of baloney.
---
I think it would be a great idea to do that. Imagine how much life they could put into dungeons (especially), fractals, and raids if you could use the currency you get to buy glider or mount skins? I'm not a fan of low chance RNG drops though a la WoW. Or other dead content I suppose. They could do something with adventures in HoT and some of the lesser run metas too to easily put some life in.
---
I just recently got into the game as well. Was a ff14/wow player for a long time. And it’s old. Gw2 seems pretty killer
---
I could totally understand why at the beginning they didn't put that right into the game, but I think now it's a very good time to think about some other cosmetic rewards, such as mounts, gliders :D
---
i like to put my food and armor variants in an invisible bag at the end of the inventory. let's say i'd have 2 armor sets for my mesmer, one for power and another for boon support with boon duration. i'd put the set i'm not currently using in an invisible bag at the end of the inventory. that way i always know where it is.  
---
normal loot tends to clump up the start of your inventory, and after you'd do the usual "salvage all &gt; compact" routine, things might line up differently in the inventory. so when you put the armor/weapons/food at the end of the inventory in an invis bag, it doesn't get sent to the start of the inventory when u press 'compact' and you always know where it is exactly.
---
I world completed with an engineer, but have since fallen out of love with the class and have been intimidated to start over - is there a recommendation for us normal folks on how to do it faster with other classes? I don't think I want to play a daredevil.
---
You know... I still marvel at how awesome GW2 looks.... Could it be better? Sure... Does it need to? Not really. They have a good mix of a realism and style. Games that are ultra-realistic like BDO and AA need to be constantly updated because the graphics look dated really quickly, GW2 has realistic moments, but it also has a lot of style built in which allows it to maintain a really good look without needing to be updated constantly. They could surely do some updates to textures and shaders... but really, like others in the thread have mentioned, they really need to do stuff like fix draw distance and fps. AFAIK this game still runs off single processor, just going multi-processor alone could do it wonders. Once that is done, they could do some minor updates to the graphics engine to make it look better... but idk, I still go to parts of PoF and go "wow this game looks cool" I even get it a bit in some sections of core.
---
In their unspoken defense, it takes time and other resources - thus money - create a model-fx-sound etc dedicated to a mounts, gliders and outfits and these are mainly designed to be sold in masses in gemstore. Anet didn't invent flying in games but they did a good job in both gliding and mounts, so they are trying to farm it as much as they can. Outfits... well at least we have free ones.
---
Man I wish I wouldnt have used potions to max it out....
---
Propably because in open world the spec offers nothing usefull except for tons of cc. I would rate it weaker than core ranger.
---
wait a minute.....there is a magic the gathering MMO?!
---
That sounds like a NVIDIA issue I had long ago. The fix was to uninstall the update, and reinstall it. Hope this helps.
---
They are already Fucking with my Mesmer since they removed non clone shatters and distortion (f4). That made it so chronos are less reliable at blocking or dodging everything but still a fine class to tank on. What has already been said I agree on. Pretty much every one can tank if you can avoid dying. And chrono makes sense since you can do 2 in one, be a support and be a tank
---
Definitely agree with what your saying about fashion wars.  I do have outfits, but they are reserved for characters that I'm in the midst of leveling up or have no idea what I want their design to be.  But I would never consider entering them into fashion shows.
---
On the other hand, those characters that I've designed using the regular armor skins are absolutely fabulous, and I love mixing and matching armor!!
---
&gt; AMA.
---
What's your favourite quaggan?
---
What do you mean it’s too late!? Just go for it it’s a game. Join raid academy or guild they will teach you.
---
Well hold on, are you struggling to spend all your vast sums of gold in this game? If you are then you're part of a minority so small it's nearly a rounding error in terms of player demographics.
---
There's plenty that is expensive or rare. A set of the 3 invisible footwear skins will run you 7k-9k gold. Legendary weapons are 2k-3k gold each. Infusions can run as high as 20+k gold depending on which one you want.
---
Having occasional armor pieces be expensive would be more tolerable if there were enough inexpensive new ones being released to satisfy players who are not wealthy. Since that is not the case, it only makes things like the charr headpiece more frustrating for the folks who feel a bit starved in terms of new armor items (and I think there's a lot of these folks).
---
Yes, that distinction has already been made. The Magnanimous works, the Unbreakable doesn't.
---
Just know that the "grind to max level" and "gear grind" are not emphasized in this game. The leveling process is rather short and easy compared to many MMOs. I think of leveling a character to 80 as sort of a tutorial where you learn a classes abilities, traits, and weapon playstyles. As such, once you hit 80 you are welcome to buy some good armor (exotic quality) off the trading post for relatively cheap. The best armor stats wise is ascended (about 5% better than exotic gear) which is a bit of a grind to get to but once you are doing high-end content it comes relatively easily. 
---
There isn't any heirloom gear but you can get experience boosters relatively easily. They come from story and map rewards and boost your experience game by quite a lot for a period of time. Buying the expansions also gives you a few free level 80 boosters. I don't recommend using them until you are familiar with the class you want to boost however.
---
I think it's worthwhile to get into the game. There is a large amount of content that is worth doing and still an active playerbase. I think we're a bit after the peak of GW2 now but content is still coming. Just last week they released a new map and a bunch of content for that.
---
No. It's 4 years of having higher priority projects to work on, with a dash of skeleton dev crew while the rest of the studio's manpower was directed to now cancelled side-projects.
---
Just lvl to 80, then play some lvl80 maps for 1day/2days and You are fully equiped in exotic gear, which is enough for high end gaming, then You can start getting ascended gear, which is like top tier, but it's not like You can't do content without it. I run in exotics for like 6months and it's all good.
---
not all head armor skins overwrite/remove hair.
---
Haha, good joke.

plz put some effort in posting and don't just try to start the same exact discussion again that was on the FP a day or two ago. Even if you would do that, make atleast a decent post and not some random 5sec text without even putting effort in (main thing is that vast majoirty of gw2 playerbase DOES NOT want graphics update, but instead engine update so it runs better on modern machines and not using a severe outdated engine and dx9).
---
Those are assets updates.
---
Look at Ember Bay. See the cool sun effect? Never used again.
---
Roller Beetle Racing was higher priority than a breakbar tutorial???

Precision X1 -  i just set the memory slider as far to the left as I could.

Why do you assume rewards from gameplay must mean ridiculously low drop rate?
---
&gt; They are too shady, not to be trusted.
---
I am still *amazed* that Shadows didn't end up being villians.  I sorta wish that they had, they're so boring as it is.
---
took me a while to figure out you are probably talking about EBG.
---
frankly without any further context the two most likely scenarios would be that either they casted it before jumping down into the lake, or that there was another rev close by that you simply overlooked.
---
GW2 graphics are the one thing absolutely fine in my opinion.
---
He only needs to stay at 600 range when the skill starts. If they teleported away before the casts ends, the skill will not fail.
---
IT SHOULD for the sake of balance, but it will not as there isn't a second check on distance at the end of the channel.
---
Now, if there wasn't any thief, mesmer or scourge around to let them teleport, that's rather weird.
---
&gt; The other way, locking rewards behind specific content only works if people like that content. I don't enjoy raiding. Locking skins behind raiding means I either never get that stuff
---
Which is fine and is literally how every reward works outside of the gemstore.
---
If you want something from raids, You should have to raid for it.
---
Still in development and not much news about it recently.
---
What content are you using it in? Open world, Fractals, Raids, WvW, or PvP?
---
This is like baby's first photoshop
---
well, catslut, if it means more skimpy outfits for male characters in general I'm down for it. Charr are so furry that I'm not really sure there's anything to see anyway lol

I just want to see more abs more often ;)

---
I returned to GW2 a couple of weeks ago and I'm having a blast.
---
Skyscale unlock is a grind.
---
And I brought up the fact that shards are available for purchase using karma, which is not a rare currency.  Anet added multiple Living Story items for purchase using karma in order to sink karma because it is so common, especially after the EOTM farms which was extremely popular with PvE players (MAJORITY).  Your response was that very few people are doing the Balthazar Temple to purchase shards with karma, which, if you were really using logic, would tell you that MOST PEOPLE are not hurting for shards by making legendaries.  The consumption rate by the majority of people is not surpassing the acquisition rate  Again, you are excluding information.
---
Judging by your unrealistic comparison, I'm assuming you don't like it.
---
And even before that we left our order to become a pact commander.
---
Depends how you do it. I'm in the process of gathering the 250 mats of each map right now. I'm taking my time, doing only a little bit every day between other events and in the end it will have taken about one month but at least I don't feel like I'm grinding it like crazy.
---
it's not bad, but its just one image layered over another with a drop shadow
---
Graphics update would be OK, as long it does not raise system requirements.
---
But not yet. GW2 needs optimization first. This is much more important. When (if ever) GW2 runs smoothly, then maybe some texture updates to vanilla maps. Not much. GW2 already looks very beautiful.
---
Also: "&lt;insert any MMO&gt; gets an graphics overhaul!"
---
Every other MMO communities: "Plzplzplzplz we too???"
---
Windows Game Bar
---
What exactly do you think needs upgrades?
---
What do you with CA when you're alone?
---
at this point in the life cycle you might be over-whelmed by everything people have that you don't have. but if you forget about that and you play GW2 as a strickly single-player game for the first 20 hours or so, its totally worth it.  The game is still beautiful and the exploring aspect is always fun and keeps me coming back each update. You could get a good 80-160 hours out of the the main game and two expansions, even more if you do boss trains, join a guild and start raids and metas to farm for collections/mounts/gear. None of that is required to progress through the story line or experience the lore. The farther you go into expansions however, the more meta events you'll come across and while they arent required, you'll run across a zerg-rush and you cant help but get caught up in the map-wide battle.  They are very fun and you'll want to try them out even if its overwhelming at first.  There is no grind to max level, as there is so much to do and doing any of it will level you up pretty quickly.  gear grind after max isn't so bad as, again, there are about 3 ways to work your way to ascended gear if you're interested in it.  You don't really NEED that gear if you're not doing raids or high level fractals (mini dungeons).
---
It's only a grind if you're ONLY looking at getting "gear this, for this character specifically".  If you relax and just play the game, the gold and loot come to you naturally and often.
---
For other races it is pretty much all hair in different styles but on sylvari it ends up with a much more definitive 'that isn't my hair' because each hairstyle is actually made up of different things.
---
Mostly Fractals, OW and Raids
---
Ah, you're right. You haven't learned how language works yet. Let me explain: There is the things you SAY and there are the things you MEAN. That post HEAVILY implies there is an issue with low droprate items, thus complains about rare items existing.
---
I've done it to solo some HoT HP, its viable and doesnt take a long time. Run about 2/3 zerk and 1/3 harrier for extra heal power. Take staff + LB/GS (I prefer GS, more damage, more utility) and basically maintain your pet with CA/Nature spirit/staff, use GS for CC/damage and Heal as one for excess buff transfers from your pet + minor heals to your tank. Drop staff 3-2-3 with quick draw for burst heals, CA for when staff is off CD evade/block with GS and easy CC breaks if you do CA5. Its definitely slower than say a full zerk SB build but you have ridiculous sustain and a tank to take aggro while you dish out damage from behind.
---
Shader cache takes some time to compile on a fresh install, then it goes much faster.
---
Ya I think this game looks great for an mmo.  Maxed everything on a Vega 56 seems to run great and look pretty.
---
I've always had zero complaints with GW2 graphically, especially considering the explosion of effects in WvW
---
meanwhile you got Renegade skills that will fail if you just turn around ...
---
This game looks very fun but I know very little about it and I’m scared I’ll get lost very fast and just not enjoy it. Should I buy an expansion from the get go to get a max level character or should I do it the old fashioned way? Also any begginer tips, like best class or what to do and what not to do?
---
Thief is great if you like to solo roam and gank people .
---
I'm saving mine for that future armor set, hope it's nice.

---
Time to report that.
---
Agreed.  WoW, ESO, FFXIV practically throw outfits and amazing weapons, clothing, housing, etc at you.  While GW2 feels so stilted.  As a role player I can find all of like 1 total look that feels at least close to what my character would wear.  But I cant get any variety or truly match their personality.
---
Fun fact, my male norn was actually a Soulbeast. I just didn't enjoy how stiff his upper body remained, he looked like a big dumb lumbering oaf to me.
---
I play Dragonhunter (Guardian) LB/M+S for meta things. Partly for defiance bar breaking, partly because WEEEEEE F2 saves. I also am trained to comm HoT metas. I choose this playstyle so I can keep an eye on everything else (map chat, minimap, boss signals) rather than my own character. LB is a huge DPS loss, so you should stay away from it.
---
For raids, I play Berserker (Warrior) A+A/M+M banners. The axe rotation is literally braindead, so I can focus on reacting to mechanics more than my rotation.
---
So just a few suggestions: if you’re using it with arc, are you making sure to rename the d3d9.dll for d912pxy and not the arcDPS one? Because I believe that the arcDPS one stays as d3d9.dll. Are you using any other addons or overlays that may not be compatible with it?
---
There's so much in your reply that shows you don't fully understand the undertaking you are asking:
---
1. A company **has to be working on new products**. The assumption is that existing products will *not* sustain them forever. Even if they want to continue with GW2 content and offer GW1 in maintenance mode for play, something still has to bring in revenue to continue paying for those efforts long term, regardless of what they are making in terms of revenue now (and more specifically profit).
---
2. The layoffs did not magically make everything faster or more focused right away. Even if they had decided to do another expansion, chances are much of this work was already in-progress at some level before then and halting it is never a good idea unless they know it won't work. Reddit can complain all it wants, but ANet has far more data on what the overall player base wants and does than anyone on this subreddit ever will.
---
3. The Prologue episode and map have a ton more content on it than I feel most maps have. They nailed, in my opinion, the original GW2 map design of having a map with just events on it. It works well, there's always something to do, and there are a decent amount of both Random Drop/tradable awards and vendor rewards to strive for.
---
4. Strike Missions - While I was initially underwhelmed by the strike mission (in story mode), I found that the actual Strike Mission itself was **not** as easy initially as Reddit made it out to be. Granted, I'm not a raider (I want to, but don't have a lot of time), but I do enjoy the mechanics in Fractals and have enjoyed what little I have played of Raids. I think the Strike Mission, as it is now, is a good intro for the average player.... not to mention /u/that_shaman's datamining of Strike Mission Challenge modes and the mentioned evolution of the boss.
---
5. You don't seem to understand the amount of work that goes into things like game engines and backend infrastructure. That picture you posted of the WoW devs probably doesn't account for the teams that work on Blizzard's game engine(s) and backend server/network infrastructure (which will have it's own set of Devs and Engineers as well). Changes to an MMO's game engine probably also mean changes to the infrastructure, which in turn would (more than likely) mean downtime to deploy (when it was actually ready). That's no small task and content would *have to be put on hold* during that time as the game devs adjusted to engine and infrastructure changes.

   1. You can't just change the underlying tools something is built on and have it "just work". It doesn't work that way. DX12 and Vulkan are complete architectural changes from their predecessors. As I'm mentioned elsewhere, DX12 has way more in common with Vulkan than it does DX9/10/11. The entire architecture is different. Changes to that in the engine would *require* changes to the game code to utilize it which would lead to more bugs before it got better. There is some cost/risk analysis that goes into that, something ANet has probably already done. There's a reason it took WoW so long to make DX11 the default and why DX12 won't be the default for a long time.
---
6. The *entire* dev world has been changing for a long time. For some reason, gamedev has been resisting these changes (and in non-MMO settings continue to resist the changes), but eventually it all filters down and one of those changes is a shift from 1-2 large releases a year to several smaller (not necessarily *small or little*) releases throughout the year. Why? It's leads to a more stable game, it's better for Dev health and mentality (which in turn leads to a better quality product), it makes issues easier to troubleshoot and fix (fewer changes to rule out as the cause), allows for iteration (I.E. adjusting to feedback is easier in this model), better for cross-team project work (which is important as MMOs are more of a hybrid of a tech company and a gamedev company). So many more things I can't think of.
---
7. One company's requirements, limitations, talent, etc are not analogous to another company's. So comparing what ArcheAge and WoW did to ANet isn't realistic.
---
Graphics updates aren't that simple nor cheap. I imagine this has been a topic the devs may have discussed internally, saw how much it costs in terms of money and work days, and decided not to go with it.
---
Reaper, because all you need to tackle dead content is an army of corpses.
---
Then Dragonhunter for fractals so I don't get bitched at for playing Reaper.
---
yeah that is exactly my point. Why would we have to prove something for those missions OP talked about just to increase in some ranking?
---
Well, that puts us in a really odd position.
---
Unless I'm one of the luckiest players around, the chance must be higher than 27%, and unless you're one of the unluckiest players around, the chance must be 25% or lower
---
(both taken with p &lt; 0.01).
---
Our combined average, ~26.2%, doesn't fit into either dataset.
---
Your data contains no cities, no southsun cove, no WvW maps and no LS-maps with lowlvl characters?
---
I didn't start collecting data until after the HoT release, but I can't imagine they increased the drop rate.
---
Yeah, so long as you only use the few pieces that are actually different from the trenchcoat archetype that takes up 80% of the medium skins. Do you not see the problem here?
---
&gt; WoW, ESO, FFXIV practically throw outfits and amazing weapons, clothing, housing, etc at you
---
Not for free, though, - all these games have subscriptions, so you do pay for all that, constantly.
---
Why?  *Because* people will purchase them.  It's really that simple.  
---
Even if you can't purchase them if you're reasonably skilled at GW2 and do a lot of T4 Fractals, Raids or a lot of open world farming you can convert gold =&gt; gems and either buy said cosmetics outright or gamble for the uncommon black lion drops.  
---
They're "micro" transactions -- not rewards -- and although that's a key distinction -- people really aren't conditioned as seeing things as in-game rewards because there really isn't much balance; more of a gem-store monopoly, really on certain types of cosmetics.  That's something the player-base as a whole is entirely fine with.
---
What makes you say that? Reddit is just a very narrow circlejerk of the most outspoken players, and does not represent the entire player base as a whole. 
---
NCSoft revenue reports clearly show that the gemstore is doing quite well and many people are apparently buying the cosmetics that Anet is creating, therefore, they can't all "suck" as the previous poster claims.
---
Isn't that dead?  I posted a while ago and got no responses, and looking around it seemed most threads were like that
---
There was that one hat that let you dye the hair. I have no idea why we didn’t get more of that...
---
Nah, is the one taking the picture
---
Welcome to GW2! I used to do a lot of sPvP but have moved my competitive PvP to LoL because of the player skill imbalance in Platinum matches.
---
Issues in sPvP won't show up until you get to higher ranks. When you get to high Gold or low Plat then the skill difference, both mechanical but also strategic/tactical, will become a factor. You end up with mismatched matches where there's a couple high Plat players or really good/great, 6 mid-low Plat players or pretty good/decent, and 2 high Gold players or just above average relatively. The Gold players spend the game being farmed and the high plat players may get frustrated.
---
The game mode is really good but the population isn't high enough to have enough top level players, and by top level I mean what would be the quality of high elo in more populated games.
---
But for unranked and lower ranks GW2 sPvP is IMvHO the best PvP mode in any non-PvP focused game. It's a lot of fun, just that like I said there are skill differential issues at the higher ranks.
---
Yeah RiT is dead. You should change it to raid academy.
---
Purple?
---
Like the drank.
---
Well, i do it every day and not once i failed to get all chests, so no, it doesnt take longer than it should.
---
Your viewpoint (and most raiders) is toxic because you are telling others what/how to play. It's literally the #1 toxic player tell.
---
Just focus on your own game and let other people be happy. I get thes Pr0 RaiDuRs at least once a week in fractals with their voice in the void title and trash tier gameplay. Not only they suck but they feel the need to tell others how to play...
---
 Inb4 no ess teams can do the run better but these guys with copypasta builds need to be 100% carried by the supports because they can't dodge, they can't move from circles, and they can't even CC correctly (classic DH that will cause a wipe before popping F1 because MUH DEEPS).
---
Back in PS1 days there were like 5 voice actors for 50 games. :D
---
I think the size and silhouette are appealing because they complement the arched posture the Charr have. I don't think those wings would look as good on other races.
---
Thank you to all for working on this.  For SCIENCE!
---
Never fails
---
Only if it benefited the player, actually.
---
Technically yes but in comparison, if you want nice gear you have to pay much more in GW2 than in WoW or FFXIV. Gems are expensive. I can't afford fashion in GW2 but had no issues in the other games even with subscription as in a month in wow I can get dozens of outfits. For the same price in GW2 I get one outfit or mount. If they're on sale. And there is nothing to 'hunt'. 
---
 But that's just one little thing. Wow and FF made me love character creation and outfits. Just need to slow down in here because I'm poor.
---
Because we Asura don't do "construction", bookah. We leave that to our ~~test subjects~~ fellow sapient races.
---
My point, which I think is being pretty clear missed, is that's stale and boring.
---
Why does anyone want that? Why can't we have Raid bosses that actually hit hard, and require a tank to know how to mitigate, apply aegis, evade etc?
---
57th run...you are crazy 👍
---
For me, it helped. To a degree. Did not solve the issues I've been experiencing lately.
---
First off, "It is guild wars 2, there are no classes who are "meant"" is a lame excuse, for under utilized boss mechanics.
---
I never said, I wanted to force a class to have to play a role. And I've already acknowledged there's heal necro's, eles, renegades, guardians. Which I had stated is awesome, and diverse.
---
What I was asking/trying to gauge was why don't we have bosses, where we have actual tanks. 
---
Also, "If you dont like mesmer as a tank, play something else." is a shitty way to deal with players in a community who are trying to spark diversity and conversation.
---
You get updates that add new items to the game every 3-4 months. 
---
You get updates that add new items to the cash shop every 1-2 weeks.
---
And did you get it to lvl 80 with tomes?
---
I'm alright with that, I love that man.
---
40 g/h how?
---
World Completion is worth atleast 500g do the math yourself
---
I agree with why doesn’t arenanet implement outfits, gliders, planting pots, balloons, kites. I could see why they don’t but I see also why it’s hurting in game activity. 
---
Why they have it? I mean tbh I’m surprised how GW2 is still profitable with no expansion for almost 2 years. Why is gw2 still profitable? Because of skins on gemstore. So it’s a good thing gw2 is getting money. 
---
If arenanet added more skins say wvw exclusive mount skins. Pvp exclusive mount skins. Raiding exclusive mount skins, fractal exclusive mount skins. World/meta boss exclusive mount skins, strike missions exclusive mount skins, (Including gliders, outfits etc.) There would be more activity just the fact of trying to get a certain skin. Then arenanet could keep whats in the gemstore, In the gemstore for example, mount skins that you can get by beating a boss only have for example 3 dyes to use. Where as gemstore you have 4. So it won’t be as good as gemstore, but it’s something to look forward to. Then make the skins all different in different game modes. So say world boss/meta could have say a Harley Davidson beetle mount. There could be instead a hover bike in pvp as a skin. Then in wvw instead there is a quad skin. In raiding there’s a bicycle skin. (Just as an example not making these skins concrete). 
---
If arenanet did that and added a skin in some type of achievement and/or challenge mote. It would make more game modes active. Then people would tip gw2 more in the gemstore just for the love of Arenanet adding those things within gw2. Its a win/win. Cause for damn sure if I saw a Harley Davidson but I had to do tangled depths 50 times. I’m damn sure going to get it. If I had to accomplish gift of battle reward track 10 times to get a quad vehicle skin in wvw I’m damn sure going to do it. And you know what..... I’d be happy to give gw2 in game money even if I had the skins.
---
Female human = Stan and Cartman’s mom, and a huge amount of other voices on South Park.  I got Sharon Marsh going “sweet sweet loot” all day.
---
No , I'm pretty sure the drop rate has always been constant. But my data is only from the last 18 months. Before that I only did map completes on like 2 or 3 characters that I mained at different times. 
---
And no , no southsun , no cities , etc.
---
Including new items added with festivals and current events, the first one is more like every month.
---
For MMO graphics are more then fine, moreover, graphic updates take a lot of resources to implement but have a low impact on actual gameplay quality (even now not a lot of people have their graphics maxed out)
---
6 to quote :)
---
Mesmer and thief are the top 2 I'd recommend, reaper/herald/guardian would be next in slot for speedruns, ele I would say would be the worst
---
Agreed. I could let it go myself if it wasn't part of a collection or if there were multiple ways to gain such an item. Makes the treasure hunter collection seem cheap in comparison
---
because there's no reason to play the game pog
---
do you have to do anything special to run arcdps with it?
---
&gt;Welcome to GW2! I used to do a lot of sPvP but have moved my competitive PvP to LoL because of the player skill imbalance in Platinum matches.
---
The bots would like to have a word with you!  
---
PvP is a shit storm. Anywhere up to and including gold, there's bots, bots getting stuck in walls, bots running close with you during start, bots spiking you instantly with perfect rotations, bots walking into traps regardless if where you put them.  
---
Gold is a sad place to be, frustrated people trying to escape the bot world and in their frustration, they lash out or alt-tab and watch youtube for you to enjoy yet another 4v5 battle, because you didn't follow their instructions.  
---
Plat is getting fun and then you realize you're working towards the top players in GW2, who are all win-trading and manipulating match making with alt accounts. The constant anxiety of falling back into gold also becomes overwhelming.  
---
Trust me, Skip PvP. It's dreadful.
---
I am really surprised that nothing at all came up between the Order of Whsipers and Order of Shadows.
---
Much of the Pact feels like an afterthought at this point imo.
---
So to clarify: you only experience flickering on loading screens and in game, and this started happening yesterday, and before that you didn’t have any flickering issues?
---
I had been searching for something like this!
---
Now I see my main mistake is use the key S to pull up.
---
Thanks a lot for this video.
---
Congrats on the solo kill!
---
This takes some serious patience and perseverance. The boss's health bar is barely moving, but you keep chipping away with constant damage. I see you weaving all four elements to get more boons and healing, and I even see some barrier for extra defense. When you get knocked back I think this is where I would fall apart, but you recover. Very nicely done.
---
To maintain a player base to sell stuff to?
---
Does the game actually tell you about the speed dash anywhere? I could never gain height and now I know why...
---
Thanks for this!
---
so that's what you did alone in w4... amazing
---
With some methods being 20x faster than others.
---
You get basically no gold roaming wvw, you want gemstore shit? Go pve.
---
🦀🦀🦀 r/unexpectedrunescape
---
Thanks, that was the answer I was looking for.
---
Fuck WvW mentality btw n-n
---
nice... that makes it the third underwater skill rev has had that has unlimited range
---
Make a support to Anet about it, don't post it here. Reddit (although often visited by Anet) is not an official support tool to get shit fixed. Go to [guildwars2.com](https://guildwars2.com), make a support and let them know that way.

---
&gt; Greetings all!  As before, here are the planned Balance update notes for next week's release! We look forward to your discussions and theorycrafting.

&gt;

&gt;~GW2 Systems Team
---
&gt;---
---
&gt;## Profession Skills
---
&gt;### General
---
&gt;When we originally created the alacrity and barrier effects, they were intended to be profession specific, but we&amp;#39;ve changed this stance after seeing how the game changed and evolved over time. While the original effects were visually iconic to their initial professions, it was a good time to update them with a look that could fit any profession.
---
&gt;- Barrier: Updated the visual effects of this effect to be less profession specific.
---
&gt;- Alacrity: Updated the visual effects of this effect to be less profession specific.
---
&gt;- Special Forces Training Area: Conditions on the Preview Holo-Golem will no longer be removed by player skills.
---
&gt;- Low-Health Traits: Updated traits that activate when the user drops below a specified health threshold so that they behave more consistently.
---
&gt;### Items
---
&gt;- Superior Rune of Antitoxin: This rune no longer removes additional conditions from allies cleansed by the player. Instead, it removes an additional condition from the player whenever a condition is removed from the player.
---
&gt;### Elementalist
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re following up on some of the tempest changes from the previous update. Speedy Conduit has been a lackluster trait for a while, so we&amp;#39;re combining it with Harmonious Conduit and creating a new trait that grants concentration. Imbued Melodies is being removed—we felt it wasn&amp;#39;t very interesting while also being unnecessarily restrictive by being tied to the warhorn. Its replacement, Transcendent Tempest, provides an effect that is unique among other grandmaster traits, which we hope will provide a more meaningful choice when compared to the other options.
---
&gt;- Signet of Air: This skill can now be activated to break stuns without a target. Activating the skill while out of range of a target or without a target while not under control effects will put it on interrupt cooldown.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Renewal (Renewal of Fire): Reduced the amount of invulnerability granted when reviving the elementalist from 5 seconds to 1 second.
---
&gt;- Burning Rage: Reduced the burning duration from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
---
&gt;- Speedy Conduit: This trait has been removed. Its functionality has been combined with Harmonious Conduit, and it has been replaced with Gathered Focus.
---
&gt;- Gathered Focus: This new trait takes the master tier, minor trait slot, and it grants 120 concentration plus an additional 120 concentration while the elementalist is above 90% health.
---
&gt;- Harmonious Conduit: This trait no longer increases damage after completing an overload. Instead it grants swiftness in addition to stability. It has also changed positions with Invigorating Torrents.
---
&gt;- Invigorating Torrents: This trait has switched positions with Harmonious Conduit. Its functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;- Imbued Melodies: This trait has been reworked, and its name has been changed to Transcendent Tempest. This trait reduces the time it takes to attain a singularity by 33% when switching elements and increases outgoing damage and condition damage by 7% for 7 seconds after an overload completes.
---
&gt;### Engineer
---
&gt;When the scrapper&amp;#39;s profession ability was changed to an F5 skill, the tool belt skill from Sneak Gyro, Detection Pulse, was replaced. That skill was sorely missed as it provided useful and skilled counterplay if well timed. As the profession mechanic needed to remain on the F5 key, we looked elsewhere and saw that Purge Gyro, an inherently defensive and utility-centric ability, had a tool belt skill that did not fit its intent. Scrapper is also getting a bit of a tune-up with its hammer skills and a reduction to the vitality loss of the Impact Savant trait, which was leaving them a bit squishier than we intended for a bruiser style of play.
---
&gt;- Equalizing Blow: Increased damage by 9%.
---
&gt;- Electro Whirl: Increased damage by 9%.
---
&gt;- Rocket Charge: Increased damage by 10%.
---
&gt;- Shock Shield: Reduced recharge from 20 seconds to 18 seconds.
---
&gt;- Thunderclap: Increased damage by 6%. Reduced recharge from 24 seconds to 20 seconds.
---
&gt;- Corona Burst: Reduced might gained in WvW to the same amount as granted in PvP. Reduced the damage of this skill by 20% in PvP and WvW.
---
&gt;- Holographic Shockwave: Reduced range from 600 to 300.
---
&gt;- Function Gyro: Increased damage by 100%. Increased land radius to 240 and underwater radius to 360. Added clarification to skill description to clarify that function gyros are destroyed when their skill is interrupted. Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 25 seconds.
---
&gt;- Shaped Charge: This trait now increases damage by 0.5% per stack of vulnerability instead of by a flat amount.
---
&gt;- Solar Focusing Lens: This trait now also grants 2 stacks of Afterburner when deactivating photon forge. Increased stacks granted from overheating from 5 to 6.
---
&gt;- Chemical Field: This skill has been replaced by Detection Pulse as the tool belt skill for Purge Gyro.
---
&gt;- Detection Pulse: This skill replaces Purge Gyro&amp;#39;s previous tool belt skill, Chemical Field. The radius of this skill has been reduced from 1200 to 900, and its targeting has been improved in large group settings.
---
&gt;- Purge Gyro: The tool belt skill for Purge Gyro has changed from Chemical Field to Detection Pulse.
---
&gt;- Sneak Gyro: Increased the cooldown of this skill from 45 to 60 seconds in WvW.
---
&gt;- Med Kit: This kit can now be used underwater.
---
&gt;- Med Blaster (Med Kit): Increased healing to match tooltip.
---
&gt;- Cleansing Field (Med Kit): Fixed a bug that caused this skill to remove more conditions than intended.
---
&gt;- Elixir U: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill to give endurance.
---
&gt;- Supply Crate: Fixed a bug in which the Healing Turret created from this skill would not overcharge.
---
&gt;- Health Insurance: Updated description and tooltips to accurately reflect the functionality of this trait. This trait increases incoming healing by 10% and increases outgoing healing by 20% while using Med Kit.
---
&gt;- Mechanized Deployment: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to grant less than the listed 15% recharge reduction.
---
&gt;- Mass Momentum: Increased stability duration from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.
---
&gt;- Impact Savant: Reduced the vitality loss from this trait from 300 to 180.
---
&gt;### Guardian
---
&gt;Firebrand prevalence in group content has been quite strong as they offer significant support options to the point that they were crowding out other builds. In particular, Tome of Courage had a bit more power than was healthy, so we&amp;#39;ve sought to tweak that down while retaining its overall playstyle by removing some of its boon generation. We&amp;#39;re also reducing scepter damage and increasing sword damage in PvE as the best melee damage option should not be a ranged weapon.
---
&gt;- Orb of Wrath: Reduced damage by 10% in PvE only.
---
&gt;- Symbol of Blades: Removed the double strike that occurs when the symbol is first created. Increased damage of each strike by 20% to compensate. Overall damage is unchanged.
---
&gt;- Zealot&amp;#39;s Defense: Increased PvE damage by 20%.
---
&gt;- Sanctuary: Increased number of enemies that can be knocked back by this skill before it expires from 10 to 20. Decreased duration from 6 seconds to 5 seconds. Decreased recharge from 75 seconds to 60 seconds.
---
&gt;- Tome of Resolve—Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery: The existing split of cleansing 2 conditions in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to cleanse 3 conditions in PvE.
---
&gt;- Tome of Courage—Chapter 2: Daring Challenge: This skill now grants retaliation for 3 seconds instead of aegis.
---
&gt;- Tome of Courage—Epilogue: Unbroken Lines: This skill no longer grants retaliation. The existing split of a 15-second cooldown in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill retains a 12-second cooldown in PvE.
---
&gt;- Purging Flames: This skill no longer reduces the duration of incoming conditions. Instead of removing 3 conditions from allies when cast, it now removes 1 condition from allies and 1 additional condition every second the skill persists. Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from being properly extended when Master of Consecrations was equipped.
---
&gt;- Eternal Armory: Changed burning from 2 stacks for 2 seconds to 1 stack for 4 seconds.
---
&gt;- Stoic Demeanor: This trait now inflicts burning for 5 seconds in addition to inflicting slow. Reduced the internal cooldown from 5 seconds to 3 seconds. Cooldown is now determined per target instead of globally.
---
&gt;### Mesmer
---
&gt;Chaotic Interruption has been reworked as a trait that offers a dynamic and skillful form of play by giving savvy players a means to use their abilities to recharge weapon skills. Some chronomancer tweaks are also in to offer another means of granting group quickness and to clean up some functional redundancy between Delayed Reactions and Lost Time.
---
&gt;- Illusion of Life: Reduced the amount of time a resurrected ally is invulnerable from 5 seconds to 1 second. This skill should now target more effectively in group situations.
---
&gt;- Power Break (Mantra of Pain): This skill now requires mesmers to face their target and respects line of sight.
---
&gt;- Power Lock (Mantra of Distraction): This skill now requires mesmers to face their target and respects line of sight.
---
&gt;- Chaos Storm: This skill now always dazes on the first strike but can no longer randomly daze on other strikes. This change also applies to Lesser Chaos Storm. Added a skill fact to show Chaos Storm&amp;#39;s duration.
---

---
&gt;- Chaotic Interruption: This trait has been reworked. When interrupting a foe, it now recharges one of your currently recharging equipped weapon skills by 5 seconds. This trait has a 1-second internal cooldown.
---
&gt;- Delayed Reactions: This trait no longer grants alacrity but now triggers on any control effect rather than only on interrupts. Added a 3-second cooldown per target.
---
&gt;- Lost Time: This trait has been reworked. It now grants 3 seconds of alacrity to the mesmer when applying slow to a target. This effect has a 3-second cooldown.
---
&gt;- Seize the Moment: This trait now applies quickness in a 240 area-of-effect radius around the mesmer and can hit 5 targets (including the mesmer).
---
&gt;### Necromancer
---
&gt;The Death Magic specialization has had a significant rework this update, revolving around a new effect and various means of gaining additional defense while bringing together a more cohesive set of playstyles. The scourge elite specialization has also undergone a significant change such that its shade skills will only fire around them when they do NOT have a shade up. If they do have a shade present, then those skills will happen around their summoned sand shades. Alongside this change, the scourge and each sand shade now affect an increased number of targets by default, which can be increased further through the use of the grandmaster trait Sand Savant. This change leans into the dependence a scourge has on their unique elite specialization mechanic, shades, and opens up the specialization to future potential improvements across its kit. This change creates a choice between whether scourges expose themselves to some melee risk but charge in to affect foes around them, or whether they hang back and summon a shade near their foe and are unable to affect themselves with shade abilities (unless they also place one on their own location). We&amp;#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the results of this change and making adjustments accordingly.
---
&gt;- Scourge: Shade skills no longer affect the area around the scourge while they have a shade present in the world. Increased the number of targets affected by shade skills from 3 to 5.
---
&gt;- Manifest Sand Shade: The duration of sand shades in WvW and PvP has been increased from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.
---
&gt;- Minion Summoning Skills: Fixed a bug that could allow minions to persist after the skill was unequipped.
---
&gt;- Oppressive Collapse: This skill now requires line of sight.
---
&gt;- Feast of Corruption: Reduced damage by 20% in PvP and WvW. The existing split of corrupting 2 boons in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to corrupt 3 boons in PvE. This skill now queues behind other skills rather than interrupting them.
---
&gt;- Devouring Darkness: Reduced damage by 20% in PvP and WvW. The existing split of corrupting 2 boons in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to corrupt 3 boons in PvE. This skill now queues behind other skills rather than interrupting them.
---
&gt;- Grasping Darkness: Fixed an issue that could cause the claw effect to pop out of existence before the skill completed. Removed misleading legendary projectile effects from this skill due to it not being a projectile.
---
&gt;- Blood Bond: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to heal the necromancer when it activated.
---
&gt;- Sand Savant: Increased the number of targets affected by the larger shade from 2 to 5 so that it now affects up to 10 targets.
---
&gt;- Death Magic: This trait line has been reworked. Many traits now revolve around a new effect called Death&amp;#39;s Carapace that increases toughness by 20 for each stack up to a maximum of 30 stacks. Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks are applied for 10 seconds from all traits except Flesh of the Master.
---
&gt;  - Minor:
---
&gt;      - Armored Shroud: This trait now gives 5 stacks of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace when entering shroud.
---
&gt;      - Soul Comprehension: In addition to its previous effects, this trait now also grants 1 stack of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace for each kill the necromancer participates in.
---
&gt;      - Beyond the Veil: This trait has been reworked. It now reduces condition damage by 10% while the necromancer has at least 10 stacks of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace.
---
&gt;  - Adept:
---
&gt;      - Flesh of the Master: Instead of granting armor for each minion, this trait now causes the necromancer&amp;#39;s minions to grant them 2 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks as long as the minions are alive.
---
&gt;      - Putrid Defense: This trait has changed positions and its functionality has changed. It now causes poison to deal 15% more damage and grants 1 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stack when applying poison.
---
&gt;      - Shrouded Removal: This trait has changed positions. In addition to its previous effects, it now grants 3 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks when a condition is removed.
---
&gt;  - Master:
---
&gt;      - Necromantic Corruption: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Dark Defiance: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Deadly Strength: This trait has been reworked. It now causes Death&amp;#39;s Carapace to grant an additional 10 power per stack.
---
&gt;  - Grandmaster:
---
&gt;      - Death Nova: Updated skill facts and description. Updated attack name from Lesser Poison Cloud to Poison Nova in order to indicate that it has different behavior from Corrosive Poison Cloud. Fixed an issue that caused this trait to use the minion&amp;#39;s stats instead of the necromancer&amp;#39;s. Fixed various issues that caused this trait to behave inconsistently with certain minions. Increased damage by 60% in PvE only.
---
&gt;      - Corrupter&amp;#39;s Fervor: This trait has been reworked. It now grants 1 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stack when applying any condition. Additionally, at 25 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks or above, the necromancer gains pulsing protection for 3 seconds every 3 seconds.
---
&gt;      - Unholy Sanctuary: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;### Ranger
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re making a major change to sword skills in order to better improve their flow during combat. Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap, Hornet Sting, and Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike are all shuffling around into new slots, which should make the weapon a little easier to understand. We&amp;#39;re also including some enhancements for the off-hand dagger, which has been a pretty weak weapon that hasn&amp;#39;t kept up with the pace of the game very well. Finally, we&amp;#39;re simplifying the greatsword&amp;#39;s Counterattack skill and taking some power out of the chain-attack sequence. We hope these changes will make the weapon feel a little smoother while removing some of the frustrating random dodges that happen when fighting against it.
---
&gt;- Long Range Shot: Reduced the minimum damage of this skill by 14% and the maximum damage by 11% in WvW only.
---
&gt;- Sword Chain-Attack Sequence: Updated icons for Crippling Thrust and Precision Swipe.
---
&gt;- Stalker&amp;#39;s Strike: Base damage of this attack has been increased by 200%. This attack now deals double damage and inflicts 2 additional poison stacks if it strikes a foe with a movement-impairing condition.
---
&gt;- Crippling Talon: This skill now uses the ammunition system and has 2 ammo with a 15-second count recharge time and a 1-second recharge between uses. Reduced cripple duration from 6 seconds to 4 seconds. Reduced bleeding duration from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.
---
&gt;- Hornet Sting: This sword skill has moved to weapon slot 3. It now recharges Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap if it hits. Its recharge has been increased from 8 seconds to 15 seconds.
---
&gt;- Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap: This sword skill is now the primary skill in weapon slot 2. Using this skill flips it over to Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike for 5 seconds. It now has an 8-second recharge.
---
&gt;- Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike: This skill is now the follow-up skill to Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap. It no longer has a recharge.
---
&gt;- Swoop: Fixed an issue that prevented the casting bar for this skill from matching the actual casting time of the dash.
---
&gt;- Counterattack: Removed the Crippling Throw follow-up skill. This skill no longer automatically uses Counterattack Kick when blocking a foe within the range threshold. Instead, blocking any attack flips the skill to Counterattack Kick for 5 seconds. Increased the number of targets for Counterattack Kick from 1 to 3. Counterattack Kick now evades for its duration and activates faster.
---
&gt;- Power Stab: This skill no longer evades for its duration. Its name has been changed to Enduring Swing. This skill now grants 15 endurance if it hits.
---
&gt;- Quick Draw: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from reducing recharge time.
---
&gt;### Revenant
---
&gt;In addition to some changes to Coalescence of Ruin and Gaze of Darkness aimed at WvW play, we are also tuning up a few of Mallyx&amp;#39;s Legendary Demon Stance skills from the last update as we felt they ended up on the weak side. Jalis&amp;#39;s Legendary Dwarf Stance skills are also seeing some improvements aimed at making them more powerful and easier to use to better warrant the use of your energy.
---
&gt;- Coalescence of Ruin: This skill no longer deals increased damage with successive impacts; it now always deals damage equal to what was previously the second-impact damage. Its damage remains split between game modes. Added a red warning rectangle visible to enemies.
---
&gt;- Embrace the Darkness: Lowered the recharge from 10 seconds to 3 seconds.
---
&gt;- Gaze of Darkness: This skill now reveals stealth enemies up to a range of 600, inflicting blindness and vulnerability.
---
&gt;- True Nature (Assassin): Reduced radius from 600 to 360.
---
&gt;- Call to Anguish: Decreased energy cost from 35 to 30. Reduced recharge from 5 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased radius from 240 to 360. Damage increased by 33%.
---
Those earth 2 timings :O
---
I need new pants. 
---
Grats dude.
---
&gt;- Inspiring Reinforcement: Increased pulsing stability duration from 1.5 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased initial stability duration from 2 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased the speed at which the road is built by 100%. Increased road length from 600 to 900.
---
&gt;- Forced Engagement: Increased damage reduction from taunted targets from 20% to 33%. This skill now also throws chains at up to 4 additional targets within a range of 360 of the selected target.
---
&gt;- Focused Siphoning: Increased base healing by 88% in PvE.
---
&gt;- Elder&amp;#39;s Respite: Added a 10-second internal cooldown to this trait.
---
&gt;### Thief
---
&gt;The previous Shadow Arts update landed pretty well overall, but we think that the siphons ended up a little weak. We&amp;#39;re tuning these up a bit, as well as touching up a few other traits that didn&amp;#39;t feel quite right. In addition to these changes, we&amp;#39;re updating Improvisation to recharge a random utility skill on the skill bar rather than a random utility skill type. This change is intended to lower the variance on the trait and to allow for more flexibility in utility selection. Finally, stolen bundles now use the ammo system in order to help with readability.
---
&gt;- Steal: Fixed a bug that could cause the shadowstep to fail in rare situations.
---
&gt;- Swipe: Fixed a bug that could cause the shadowstep to fail in rare situations. Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 25 seconds.
---
&gt;- Hidden Thief: Fixed a bug that could cause this trait to activate even if Steal failed.
---
&gt;- Leeching Venoms: This trait now immediately grants a stack of spider venom when the thief first enters stealth and every 3 seconds after.
---
&gt;- Improvisation: Instead of recharging an entire skill category at random, this trait now recharges one of your equipped utility skills at random.
---
&gt;- Stolen Bundles: Stolen bundles now show their number of uses as ammunition.
---
&gt;- Shadow Siphoning: Increased base healing by 62%.
---
&gt;- Cloaked in Shadow: Increased base damage and the damage multiplier by 100%. Increased base healing by 100% and the heal multiplier by 60%.
---
&gt;- Lead Attacks: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to grant less than the listed 15% recharge reduction.
---
&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re focusing on changes to the Tactics trait line and warhorn skills. We&amp;#39;ve removed the traits related to reviving allies in order to make room for new traits and improvements to old traits that focus more on ways warriors can affect allies while they are still in the fight. The new Tactics traits are focused around empowering allies through boons and effects, helping allies who are taking a beating, and a selection of warrior-enhancing battlefield strategies.
---
&gt;- Charge: The icon for this skill has been updated. This skill now only removes movement-impairing conditions. It now increases the damage of affected allies&amp;#39; next 2 attacks by 25% (10% in WvW) for 8 seconds in addition to its previous effects. Increased swiftness duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds. This skill is now a blast finisher.
---
&gt;- Call to Arms: This skill has been renamed Call of Valor, and its functionality has changed. Removed an unnecessary unblockable skill fact. This skill now removes 3 conditions from affected allies instead of specific conditions. It also now applies barrier in addition to vigor.
---
&gt;- Sight beyond Sight: Increased the radius of this skill to reveal stealth enemies within a radius of 600.
---
&gt;- Burning Arrows: This trait has been removed, and its effects have been merged with Crack Shot in the Discipline line.
---
&gt;- Crack Shot: Instead of granting bonus adrenaline for base harpoon gun shots, this trait now adds 3 seconds of bleeding to each shot.
---
&gt;- Tactics: The Tactics line has been reworked. Several traits in this line now revolve around a new effect called Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus, which grants bonuses when executing bursts.
---
&gt;      - Marching Orders: This new trait grants the Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus effect every 15 seconds. This effect is expended when hitting with a burst to grant 3 stacks of might for 15 seconds to allies within a range of 300.
---
&gt;      - Empowered: Moved from the adept tier. The effects are unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Mending Might: This trait applies might to an ally and heals the warrior.
---
&gt;      - Leg Specialist: In addition to its previous effects, this trait now also grants a 7% damage bonus against foes suffering from a movement-impairing condition. The cooldown on this trait is now calculated per target.
---
&gt;      - Soldier&amp;#39;s Comfort: This new trait heals nearby allies when Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus activates.
---
&gt;      - Roaring Reveille: This new trait increases the number of targets for warhorn skills from 5 to 10 and causes warhorn skills to grant an additional boon. It grants fury for Charge and resistance for Call to Arms. It also grants an additional 120 concentration.
---
&gt;      - Warrior&amp;#39;s Cunning: This new trait increases damage by 25% against foes with health above 90%. Additionally, it increases damage by 50% against foes that have barrier. These bonuses do not stack.
---
&gt;      - Shrug It Off: This trait has moved, and its icon has been updated. In addition to its previous effect, it also causes the warrior to heal allies when removing damaging conditions from them.
---
&gt;      - Empower Allies: In addition to its previous effects, this trait also increases the radius of Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus to 600. Added a missing number of targets skill fact.
---
&gt;      - Martial Cadence: This new trait causes Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus to reduce the warrior&amp;#39;s equipped weapon skill cooldowns by 3 seconds.
---
&gt;      - Vigorous Shouts: This trait no longer grants adrenaline when using shouts. Instead, it grants healing power equal to 13% of power.
---
&gt;      - Phalanx Strength: Increased might duration from 4 seconds to 5 seconds.
---
I wish this game had different damage types and modifiers in a random range, like GW1 had. People grinded hard for that last 1% damage but it was a goal. Or choosing which type of armor to wear based on what element you might get hit with. There was much more to think about than "toughness for power, cleanse for condition". 
---
Now it's all looks with identical stats, and I have plenty of gold but nothing to spend it on because I'm not drawn to shinies.
---
Genuinely saddest moment in my life so far
---
Will do, cheers!
---
I'd be a moron to disagree with you. But the point is, there are zero ways to get raid rewards without raids, specifically. I almost left this game trying to get the PvP backpiece, which I did get. I don't like the content, but I did the content. If you think that makes for a satisfying gaming experience, I don't know what to tell you.  I'd actually prefer to WvW than to SPvP, even though SPvP is over all more rewarding.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
rabbit ears?
---
Arguably the only grind for the skyscale is the 250 currency for each zone. As someone who farms a full home instance every day and also plays those zones when they come out, I had almost all of the currency before I ever started working on the skyscale. 
---
Nothing else about the Skyscale did I consider grindy, so, yeah...depends on how you play.
---
There are a lot of people who go into a new zone, play it for a day or two and never go back to it. Those people are certainly going to have to grind a lot harder than I did.
---
&gt; Speedy Conduit: This trait has been removed. Its functionality has been combined with Harmonious Conduit
---
Fucking finally. Those traits should have been one trait right from the start. I don't even care what the new trait is.
---
Or you could have explained the difference in the very first post you made, rather than just saying they're different and not going any further.
---
Holy crap, this is so cool. 
---
What runes and stuff did you use?
---
The only interesting part was the trait that gave 10 power for each stack but still not worth it
---
Guardian nerfs?  Meh, I'm still going to run Scepter since it gives me a ranged option.  Raiding DH may swap to sword, but for Fractals and OW, Scepter will remain the smart choice imo.
---
If I had money for Griffon I wouldn't be watching a how to make gold video :/ Good ideas for people who are able to use the mounts and rewinder thingy though!
---
we already had this - shout heal war.
---
Thanks Anet for still not adressing ranger being an overall horrible profession to play against in WvW. 
---
Maybe next year I guess.
---
And then he has no chill when the next line is "Chopped up to bits!"
---
When you've watched many 80s cartoons about birds of metal in space a.k.a Silverhawks, you *know* you gotta flap down lol.
---
So...Death Magic still dead?
---
Where are the drawnbacks of mirage and soulbeast?
---
"the best melee damage option should not be a ranged weapon."
---
This is a matter of taste. Dragonhunter is technically specialized on the longbow, so this isn't really a rational reason. Harmonizing the weapons would be a better explanation for such changes, but they didn't use that.
---
They don't even hide that they don't give a shit.
---
Where exactly did I counter my own statement? Just because a few people out of a larger group worked on something doesn't mean the whole group was part of it. 
---
There is a department with enough manpower to create a large number of unique assets and textures for something as big as hot/pof yet they decided to go full-on copy and paste for the latest update? Doesn't really make sense to me.
---
Also if you work as a 3D artist as well tell me how on earth you came up with this part:
---
&gt;To say that the artists were doing something else is not just false, it's insulting.
---
I never said they did nothing and working on something else is neither insulting nor bad... What exactly is bad/insulting about working on a different project/game?
---
As a main reaper, I approve this message.
---
Taylor Swift "Shake It Off!" elite spec pls anet ty
---
Oh look, despite a whole bunch of feedback saying that the Detection Pulse change was shoving a useless PvE skill onto the Scrapper's tool belt, they still went ahead with it. It's such a terrible design decision.
---
Why even ask for feedback? I don't think they took any of it into account for the other professions either.
---
I would like the scourge be able to delete a shade instead of having to resummon one on top of itself which is horrible when moving around.
---
&gt; [Guardian] We're also reducing scepter damage and increasing sword damage in PvE as the best melee damage option should not be a ranged weapon.
---
&gt; Zealot's Defense (a ranged skill) : Increased PvE damage by 20%.
---
Ok
---
No Condi Daredevil nerf is a BIG miss for sPvP balance. It should have been there. The build is already reaching very annoying level of popularity right now.
---
&gt; Function Gyro: Increased damage by 100%. Increased land radius to 240 and underwater radius to 360. ***Added clarification to skill description to clarify that function gyros are destroyed when their skill is interrupted.*** Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 25 seconds. 
---
It's good to know that the function gyro is not actually intended to function.
---
Where are chrono changes???
---
Warr heals: https://media.giphy.com/media/26AHLsZkEKRGMFgFq/giphy.gif
---
He means that heal warrior now seems somewhat viable. Before shout heal warrior was complete garbage compared to other healing classes
---
Well shout warrior was meta before specialization changes.
---
Coming Soon™
---
&gt; Long Range Shot: Reduced the minimum damage of this skill by 14% and the maximum damage by 11% in WvW only.
---
?
---
Changing things to change them.  The way MMOs are balanced these days.
---
&gt; Mending Might: This trait applies might to an ally and heals the warrior.  
---
what does this mean? it replaced Inspiring Presence, but what does it do? you are healed when you apply might to allies? you apply might to allies when you heal yourself?
---
No holo nerfs in PvP?
---
Was expecting less and got even less then that
---
Sounds more like this should be coming from a necro, but ok.
---
meh, i had the same complaint when scourge was king i started and finished meteorlogicus, then reaper got buffed and i no longer needed scepter. i havent used that legendary in over 6 months.
---
my guard uses it but i rarely log into that toon unless i want to fractal
---
xD
---
I used an SAB tribulation boombox and got the knockback effect that happens when the achievement triggers.
---
Thank you XD
---
It's best when it's followed by:
---
&gt; *"Chop that sucker up good!"*
---
In two years when a next expansion launches or something, also with the drawbacks of firebrand I guess
---
Coalescence of Ruin nerfed in PvE anyway. Why nerf underperforming weapons? It's so easy to split the damage more in this case.
---
FYI, currently the last pulse has a coefficient of 2.25 in PvE/PvP, 1.75 in WvW. The nerf means that it always does 1.75 in PvE/PvP, 1.5 in WvW. That's a 22% nerf in PvE/PvP.
---
They could have let it do 2.25 in PvE, it would've been so easy, just change the number they're already changing to a different number.
---
As if this subreddit shows how the game is going. We are a small subreddit compared to how many that is playing.
---
The thief siphons ended up "a *little* weak"? Theyre so massively underpowered they would never, ever make a difference. 100% buff on cloaked in shadow doesnt even get it close to being 1/5 as good as the previous version. Stop being so cautious, and go in. A 1000% buff on Cloaked in Shadow wouldnt make it good. Hell, Im not even convinced it would make it worth picking. But it would certainly make it not be a joke. Until then, the SA changes were just downgrades noone asked for.
---
nice!, but why do you tick "double-tap to evade"? that's a killer on a jp, you try to edge forward a bit more and suddenly youre leaping to your death.
---
True dat, but a ranged weapon isn't necessary weak on close range and stronger on distance.  
---
This reasoning is poor and there would be better perspectives to balance this way and would tell that they have the focus to the game structure.  
---
With the actual explanation, you could say the best option would be hammer or greatsword when you see "better" here for burst damage &amp; mace could be weaker as the sword if you use that logic.
---
I came back after a few months break to play the new release, is this why I felt like my necro was hitting like a wet tissue? It wasn't that I was rusty, but that I was nerfed?
---
Guard scepter has always been a bizarre counterpoint to the idea that ranged weapons do less damage in exchange for safety. It's deserved this for years.
---
They are on record as being anti-minions. They feel that it provides too much of a passive playstyle. Whereas I love being an active minion master. Oh well back to CoH.  Only reason I played Necro was to soothe the pain of losing the Mastermind, the best pet-based class ever.
---
Huh.... Second patch in a row that thief wasn't nerfed
---
Err, what did ruin about it for you? Having to use discipline now?
---
very nice tutorial, now with some practise I can finally fly this mount.
---
yeah no, chemical field was absolutely useless in wvw, while detection pulse is massively useful.
---
maybe they should've made that split from pvp/wvw so pve could keep the chemical field, but i doubt they could implement that so quickly.
---
I don't have to do anything when everything is available to you without even getting off your chair. Don't be lazy. Use the internet for more than memes and porn.
---
&gt;	The scourge elite specialization has also undergone a significant change such that its shade skills will only fire around them when they do NOT have a shade up. If they do have a shade present, then those skills will happen around their summoned sand shades
---
Ouch.  :-(
---
So.. how many of the people whining here were actually supplying feedback on the forums during those WEEKS when they asked for it?
---
You lose your 800 dps pet, that's something.
---
I'm pretty sure they abandoned their philosophy of tradeoffs partway through and are content with leaving the ones they did apply it to crippled.
---
the fun begins when you realize a warrior deals 50% extra damage from one trait against you.
---
The chemical skill was in effect useless in PVE, but since no meaningful WvW balanace was obtained in this patch I agree anet balance remains a joke.
---
That's the thing, the theme of Death magic is toughness because the self-imposed limitations for the necromancer theme makes it impossible to do many other things with it:
---
* More health comes from shroud/barrier and necromancer already has lots of health, so more vitality is out of the question.
---
* Self-healing focus with Blood magic and life stealing. 
---
* Barrier is a scourge thing.
---
* Defensive boons will be used sparingly as necromancer relies more on debuffing enemies. 
---
* Weakness has been linked to the Curses line.
---
* Moving around faster goes with the Spectral theme and that goes with Soul Reaping.  
---
* Focus on evade is not part of the necromancer fantasy.
---
* Invulnerability is too strong for an already resilient profession. 
---
That leaves mostly two defensive tools left for Death Magic: Toughness and AI.
---
It's like trying to solve a rubik's cube that is missing most of the stickers in all sides but 2.
---
I don't know what's their reasoning on this particular change, but I've heard them say that the order of traits (top, middle and bottom) represents styles of builds, so they organize them in this way to represent the "3 focuses of the trait line"
---
It's both. Longbow is a weapon specific to Dragonhunter for Guardians.
---
Yes, but thats because SA (especially now) is woefully weak. SA simply needs to focus on short-term stealth benefit. The previous traits (no crits in stealth and 25% less damage in stealth) did that. The thing just needed to be amped a bit. The new ones just suck.
---
Now I realised I deleted comment, thinking it was double - basically I wrote, that overall direction of changes to Chrono (which I just geared up) make me want to do just portals to daily JPs and play pve content with quickbrand.
---
Luckily I see alacrigade not often in fracs, most often I see DH, SB and Reapers (also tempting, 'cos it's so relaxing, just spinning round and round). But tbh. I don't really want to give up Chrono - despite everything it's still fun spec (mostly thanks to being Mesmer rn, I guess).
---
&gt; but why do you tick "double-tap to evade"? that's a killer on a jp, you try to edge forward a bit more and suddenly youre leaping to your death.
---
I migrated to GW2 from UT3 and naturally, set "double-tap to evade" on. After a couple months of getting accustomed to movement timing in GW2, I no longer have any of those accidents people are always scaring everyone about, but have great control over the direction of my dodge anytime without pressing extra buttons.
---
I'm glad Ranger sword is being reworked. It has been stuck in 2012 mode for years.
---
The new Tactics tree very much reads like a half-baked elite spec to me. It's very strange to add an entire mechanic to a class with a traitline that isn't an elite, and this one seems to introduce a build option that is otherwise completely unavailable to the class, even before the rework. Seriously, if it added Mantras that granted boons/healing/whatever and an F2 to generate Soldier's Focus then it'd add enough to be on par with some simpler elite specs.
---
I'm a human female. I dressed my human female in the winged armor, but that's still wayyyy more clothing than I wear in the summer. So I guess I have been objectifying myself long before I started objectifying my character? Lol. As long as all the races and genders can be equally slutty, I am all for swimsuits and skimpiness!
---
I'm not even talking about balance here. I'm talking about the design philosophy that undercuts any number tweaks they could make.
---
Chemical Field wasn't too useful because, numbers-wise, it didn't do much beyond just reducing healing by applying poison.
---
At that point, they could tweak it.
---
With this patch, they've conceded and stomped over it with something that literally has no use in PvE. There is no option to make that tool belt skill useful any more. It's the most degenerate thing they could have done with it.
---
I think I would literally kill myself if I had to complete the whole world with the level up diamond bouncing around in the corner
---
That comes with its own weird dangers since its so immobile.
---
Without numbers it's hard to say anything about viability. But all these changes on paper look weird.
---
- "Soldier's Focus" is an on-demand heal (of unknown amount) + laughable 3 stacks of might (6 with PS, but you're not going to be running that if you want to heal, because read next line) once every 15 seconds, which makes it super situational and unreliable.
---
- No new synergy with shouts, which are warrior's only way to more-or-less reliably heal allies (with Vigorous Shouts, which conflicts with PS, so less might).
---
- The only new source of healing added is heal on condi cleanse, which is also situational and unreliable.
---
- "Mending Might" might be their solution, but the description is so vague, it's utterly useless for explaining just what does this new trait do. "An ally", meaning one target? "Heals the warrior", but not anyone else? Don't we already have Defense traitline for self-healing?
---
Nothing of this sounds like it will make a proper healer of out a warrior. I'm actually more worried that Tactics might once again overshadow Berserker traitline, given so many new +% damage modifiers from Tactics traits, including previously adept trait being made minor (i.e. unconditionally active), and we'll be back to playing sluggish DPS builds, possibly even forcing everyone back to Core spec from Berserker...
---
If anyone wants to use S to pull up then you can still bind Mount Ability 2 to S. This will prevent you from being able to walk backwards while on mounts, so you'll have to bind it to Shift + S instead. This can be seriously annoying at first but you'll get used to it eventually.
---
For anyone wondering why camera vertical position sliders need to be on the far left it's because it gives you the best view of your griffon's position relative to the ground when flying at low altitude.
---
You can keep holding the dive key while pulling up to retain the improved endurance regeneration that you usually get while diving. This will allow you to flap more times and thus regain any "lost height" faster.
---
Lastly, if you're on the EU server and wish to join a friendly guild of open world griffon flyers, please do send a PM to either Falkna (that's me), Orpa*ñ*, or any of our other lovely \[Sky\] members. (You'll usually find us at hanging around Shaemoor in Queensdale)
---
No one: ...
---
You: "Omg everyone hates meeeeeeee"
---
Ah! I've been thinking of making a video with specifically a button overlay to help people with drifting on the beetle, but couldn't find sensible software for that so abandoned the idea. It's great to see a tutorial like this exists for griffon now, thanks for sharing!
---
Please lower the music next time, it’s hard to hear at spots!
---
So... Sword/Focus instead of Scepter/Focus for DH?
---
2019 has not been nice to Guardian
---
With sand savant you will now hit 10 targets, around you without summoned shade or around the shade after summoning it. This is actually a huge buff in basically all situations.
---
I'm a French player on NA and I never had any issue with anyone.
---
What doesn't make sense is that given how slow hammer is, it needs to be a heavy hitter. And as a ranged weapon, it made a lot of sense to play with positioning to be able to use CoR properly, making that big damage at the end feel deserved (and at least it was fun to play). With this nerf, the killed having a ranged option for power revs.
---
It looks more like stuff you would want in place if you were going to add a heal oriented elite spec
---
There's no functional difference.
---
They like to line up elite spec traits by function when possible. The bottom line after this change will have all aura-based traits, while the middle line will have overload enhancing traits. Unstable Conduit is both, but is more of an aura trait so it's in the bottom.
---
Yes, haven't I made it obvious? Thief is my favourite class and I hate the direction it's going. Of course I'm salty.
---
So wait a second. How many traitlines were you using?
---
You said "Berserker", that's one.
---
You said "Warrior's Sprint", that's Discipline - two.
---
You said "Burning Arrows", that's Tactics - three.
---
You said longbow/sword, that's Arms, because what's the point of playing condi warrior without Arms traitline - that's four.
---
...wat?
---
They probably did but since you can get banned for the slightest hint of actual criticism that isnt accompanied by some good dick sucking of the devs, people just dont use the official forums lol. Also getting time outs on dev streams for asking a question like the one guy a few weeks back. The feedback has always been there and the writing on the wall in bright, neon colors. They just pick and choose what they want to hear.
---
It's in the mastery descriptions, but I doubt many wait around to read it when their griffon just got an upgrade.
---
these changes aren't made for the sake of reason or balance..or even for class identity and feeling
---
they're made for people like the person you replied to, going all "wow new cool toys to play with"
---
i mean look at the new trait names and functionality..a lot of pointless fluff and change for the sake of change
---
I loved playing mm in early gw1. Miss old time
---
Try Spite/Soul Reaping/Reaper.
---
Fuck minions, do all the damage yourself.
---
chrono nerfs XD
---
The grandmaster for perma protection is nice
---
Which we know isn't coming anytime soon.

I literally just found this topic an hour ago. And that doesn't make him not threatening or threatening.
---
It's one thing to be viciously beaten and defeated, it's another to be "beaten" when that was literally your goal. It means we have zero idea how that fight would've gone if Bangar truly wanted to fight back and possibly hurt or kill Rytlock.
---
Personally, I feel like CoH Mastermind is too much microing minions and not enough of actually playing. I want a good balance.
---
Chrono change to Seize the Moment looks great for PvE. You should be able to remove Well of Action for another utility without dropping boon uptime.
---
You can bring Mimic for better boons overall, Feedback, Precog, Null Field, Portals (!!!), Mantra of Concentration, Mantra of Distraction, etc.
---
The possibilities are endless, and i love that Chrono will finally be back to being a "grab bag of tricks" relevant to whatever situation you're in.
---
People keep claiming this over and over and over again, and yet you can go to the forums right now and there is a shitton of criticism that is quite clearly not getting removed or getting the user banned.
---
Weird, i remember being able to use my pet with soulbeast.
---
A lot of people complained about this change. They're still doing it because it's better for the game overall. Detection Pulse is a unique skill that is situationally very useful (WvW), while Chemical Field is very generic and can be acquired elsewhere.
---
You can go Elixer Gun instead and you still get condi cleanse + poison aoe, it's the same purpose as the old purge gryo setup. You can also go Mortar Kit for a poison field if you want.
---

---
If you are on EU, do apply. Training schedule is always busy.
---
I'm just hopping back in. Is Chrono no bueno anymore? Is it still a raiding mainstay?
---
Which totes makes sense since they are the ones, despite being anti-minion, made minion skills.  /s
---
All they had to do to not put them GW2 was say the spells had been lost over the course of the 250(?) years between GW1 and GW2
---
Don't think this was meant to be taken seriously.
---
Truth. Close to how I felt at a certain point in the living story recently. Had a certain implied thing been real, pretty sure I'd have gone back to one and stayed there....
---
didnt expect the tempest line to completly change. curious how this will impact my pve gameplay
---
I said the same thing as a top-level comment and got nuked to -4 before I deleted it, hah.
---
On topic, though, this very much does feel like an incomplete/simplified elite spec. It adds a new mechanic to the class and opens up build possibilities that were not available before. Give it boon-generating Mantras to synergize with Roaring Reveille and an F2 to generate Soldier's Focus at some cost on-demand and it'd basically be on-par with some other elites.
---
Nightmare gives more condi damage and less duration (and the blind in the 6 piece set is a minor bonus on mirage). The difference is pretty minor between builds that don't already cap out on duration but since it has the bonus and is easy to get through dungeons it is better overall. TL;DR 20% duration + 175 condi &gt; 25% duration + 36 all stats but it's pretty close.
---
Also that Deadly Strength skill looks fantastic.
---
It's a step forward for sure, even if they aren't copying the best example out there.
---
Reading the devs gushing over their own hard work and all the details they've weaved in is one of the most enjoyable things to do on all the forums.
---
Oh, this sure will murder the revenue. Entire gemstore is available ingame tomorrow (that's 100% what this thread is asking for) and not a single soul gives Anet money anymore. I mean.. Come on.
---
I still wish we had gotten a storyline with no dragons at all, but at least we have no "hurr durr im evil cuz corruption" bullshit this time.
---
In CoH it all depends on your powersets for how active you want to personally be. Dark for example is an extremely active secondary, while Force Field is great for those who want to be more passive. The same with primaries, as Robots are pretty much the Ronco Rotisserie of pets, "Set it and forget it!" As the LT tier can heal and shield them for you, and Thugs requires constant attention because that stupid fucking arsonist is your highest DPS pet but also your squishiest, and he loves to get up close and personal.
---
It was already degenerate. Scrapper as a PvE class is entirely degenerate and non functional. It has been since release. The heal spec is not exactly functional in PvE, but SEMI playable. Any other builds are straight up troll as far as PVE goes. No matter which of these degenerate specs you choose, YOU DO NOT USE CHEMICAL FIELD. 
---
Lets look at when you need chemical field. 
---
Not for DPS as you admit. You use it for poison. But you also only use it when you don't have better options available; such as grenade kit or main hand pistol or allies. 
---
Yet you'd only not use grenade kit over purging gyro if you need pulsing condi cleanse - also pretty niche in PvE. 
---
So, which cases in PvE do you run into that you think scrapper is good, dont' have allies, need pulsing condi cleanse to justify running chemical field as anti-heal over grenade kit (or pistol if running any type of condi build)? 
---
I'd say the use for chemical field in PvE was very close to non existant.
---
Likewise detection pulse is a NICHE. It's rare but stealth exists in PVE and can be broken in PvE. You know, those few parts of PVE where you can use it like intended, and actually bring something most other classes do not have access to. Not sure why you pretend it can't be used compared to the amazing utility "apply poison!" 
---
So the previous skill had effectively no use except edge cases in PVE. You still have access to the poison utility if you run other skills. Furthermore you gained more available access to anti-stealth; which also has niche use in PVE. Meanwhile the entire class is degenerately BAD in PVE yet this part, and not any of the more pressing reasons why scrapper is awful in PvE, is why you're whining? A skill which - by design- will never be relevant in PVE because it's tied to a SLOW PULSING CONDI CLEAR, which is generally worse than many of your other options for PvE. 
---
Yet here you are. 
---
So please do explain in which cases you needed the poison of chemical field. I'm intrigued to hear this one.
---
Yeah and it makes sense, the Commander earned the support from the Pact, and likewise the Pact is recovering but won't turn down a request if it fits their unifying goal.
---
Upvoted because sword mainhand will now feel clunky. *Especially* that none of the feedback threads asked for sword changes.
---
&gt; which has a bunch of traits tied to it 
---
which are applied to you when you are merged.  
---
But ok, I mostly agree that Soulbeast has drawnbacks, they just need to adjust the "merge with the downed pet, unmerge, now it is healed" problem. But there is no drawnback at all for Firebrands and Mirages. Heck, Loremaster makes the virtues even a lot better than DG or Guardian. Retaining passive? Yes please.  
---
Also to be fair, one drawback for Mirage is, that I have so much spite for it, I would delete my game, but I would never play as Mirage.
---
I’m calling it now that Bangar gets his entire group turned into icebrood. Instead of controlling Jormag, Jormag will control him.
---
I feel like they could make it so minions require direct management and that would solve the whole "passive playstyle" thing.  It really just seems like they don't want to have to put money or resources into balancing something like that and they are just using the whole "passive playstyle" thing as an excuse.
---
Fractals always [prefer power DPS](https://discretize.eu/builds), in raids [condi DPS holo](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/condition/) has enough time to just [barely overtake](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) [power holo](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/) but the rotation on condi is much harder than power. For open world, anything works really but things usually die pretty fast to power's burst.
---
&gt; Thief and Daredevil should get a different set of stolen skills.
---
they can be the same, they just need to be better. they havent kept up with how the game has evolved
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a minion revamp where minions are made much more powerful, but will constantly drain life force though not as quick as shroud does.  Once you are out of life force, the pets disappear.  So you can't just let pets do everything, you have to be constantly attacking to build life force to keep your pool high, and if you have a lot of pets out, it limits your shrouds availability.
---
That's about \~2% DPS loss on scepter, if you do your rotation.  
---
Honestly not that much and you get proper ranged option.
---
&gt; the direction it's going.
---
new here?
---
To me, the places I've shown feel more consistent. Tombs might drop only one rare sometimes or none at all. Whereas Abbadon's ascent, even if you get no rares, has a consistent 35-40s. Don't forget to vendor your Orrian Pearls unless you need them for the currency. The other advantage against tombs is the speed at which you can run through your parked characters. At Abbadons ascent, 3 characters is just a little over 1.5 min (if u have a slower pc then a little bit longer to load)
---
The Southsun method is a bit more inconsistent  but pays off great if you get a map with 1 to 3 nodes spawning. I'd still call it  one of the top places to park.
---
The Sanctum of Nabkha is always going be good but you only get to loot the three chests once per day, per account.
---
Cheers
---
Instead of being completely selfish they could always make traits that effect allies as well.
---
Mostly because not many in-combat gap closers, your best weapon is probably sceptre (which has very limited AoEs) since staff is really slow, despite the AoEs staff brings to the table, mobility is limited unless in air.
---
Numericaly its still decent. Its not the powerhouse it once was, but tbh it was a little too good anyway.
---
Raids and Fractals will still absolutely take a good Chrono player in a variety of roles.
---
The shatter changes have just made it feel ugly to play. Specifically having to have clones up to use your shatters at all. It doesn't sound bad when writing it out, but it feels very, very limiting.
---
But that goes mostly in the 'support' line, which is Blood Magic for necromancers.
---
Blood magic could use some love too.
---
Except Bangar's plan and motivations make a lot more sense. Thanos' solution is meaningless because anyone can Google Baby Boom and see that it won't work.
---
Lol this literally comes up monthly. Still nothing from Anet.
---
So it looks like I'm never going to press f1 as scourge ever again, and my minor traits just got deleted. Thanks?
---
They removed the self Prot from Beyond the Veil I think, which defeats the purpose of a selfish defensive line. I don't think the toughness spam from the whole traitline was worth the Prot when leaving Shroud in terms of competitive modes.
---
They still kept the garbage on death traits as well. Like cmon, stuff like Soul Comprehension shouldn't be a trait. They also missed an opportunity to change Death Nova trait so it allows necro to generate Jagged Horrors within combat, rather than relying on some trash to die. Like would it kill them to change it so either killing or fearing a foe generates a Jagged Horror (Fear and Jagged 'Horror', get it)? Atleast remove the cooldown so the Necro can kill groups of enemies without being punished for not killing them one at a time.
---
I like that idea. Heck, they could do away with minions as base class skills and make a whole elite specialization out of it (similar to what they did with Guardian tomes), hopefully replacing them with skills that are more useful.
---
To be fair, it was 6 seconds when it was a thing, then 4...now 5. Not as strong as before, but not as weak too.  
---
I am mildly excited for it. Too bad that, actually if I understood it right, with the Tactics you have to choose between heal, or give might/power to allies.
---
Well you're invuln for few seconds after getting ressed sooo....
---
Unless invuln doesn't work anyway, can't remember.
---
*looks at the GW2 logo*
---
So I have some bad news for you...
---
seems like you lose lesser squall but gain 130 conc.
---
So Chrono is still unfun and just a crippled mesmer. Thank you for keeping bullying us, ANet.
---
Yeah, but Matthias have some downtime due to mechanics (invul during reflect, AoE around people, poison you need to clean or AoE to drop) that will help classes that have great spike Dps. Herald is really not a great spike dps and will affect is overall performance compare to Berzerker or even Weaver.
---
So most likely that guy was unlucky or I'm wrong. :)
---
ITT: eksdee
---
I am actually happy with that change. If you get a build focused on support without damage (like healing/boons with Scepter, Staff and Illusionary inspiration) you can spam rewinders enough to, maybe, not even need Well of Action anymore, maybe switching it for Well of Precognition.
---
Actually yes. Imagine rezzes without invuln frames though.
---
NPCs are not affected by player rules.
---
shout warrior build was go to for zerg play in WvW.  Loved those days.
---
... That's a standard of character writing that dates back decades or centuries depending on who you ask. Either way the pure evil character isn't terribly interesting to a lot of audiences these daysm
---
I was thinking about that after playing through the prologue crit path and it makes a ton of sense.
---
But it raises a couple more interesting points. Now that they've confirmed the trailer is Jormag directly addressing Bangar with specific fears, it calls into question the other two "acts" in it.
---
The end is Jormag's reveal, so we won't count that as a fear.
---
We have the burned charr and cub... fear of Primordus?
---
The centaur slave drivers... does this hint at Woodland Cascades in episode 3/4, to the west of Drakkar Lake?
---
More importantly, IMO, is the water scene. A scuttled ship is not really a specific fear on its own. I'm thinking pretty strongly now that Jormag knows something about the Deep Sea Dragon, and will use peoples' fear of it to influence them. I'd go so far as to make a hail-mary guess that fear of the DSD will form the final arc of the saga.
---
I might be wrong but I think it's just an overall nerf. Current Sword2 is utter crap, the animations are super long (who needs such a HUGE dodge anyway), it's a net dps loss because the damage upon reactivation is weaker than just sticking to the auto-attack chain, and the evade frame is super short and very hard to time properly.
---
Current Sword3 however provided a very nice evade, much easier to utilize because longer. And they just decided to take it away. I mean, not entirely, but with this updated version we'd have to cast Sword2 once to unlock it, I don't know how much time we'll have to reactivate, but whatever it is won't be as comfortable as having it on demand.
---
In my opinion they just should have done away with Hornet Sting (current first activation of Sword 2). I don't know why rangers would ever need two evades in the same weapon kit.
---
Aren't CM fractals going with pretty much FB + Rev for support nowadays? So that only limits Druid to raids.
---
Of course Druid never really enjoyed being support in any other mode as well. They were never used in WvW as zerg support and barely used in PvP nowadays and never really as group support. In fact, Ranger to date has never had a single viable WvW zerg build since launch.
---
Well obviously, nothing is original anymore and never will be. My post was referring to most recent popular media.
---
I really don't get why they feel the need to give these speed boost at all. I can totally see how on paper it seemed like they would need the superspeed to not suck, but now that we have seen how crazy mirage cloak is it really should come with it's intended drawback of not moving.
---
Maybe you should literally not be able to move while in mirage cloak? Sounds obnoxious but it would definitely be more of a real downside.
---
Yes, gorse is a straight up dps check, in theory there is the wall mechanic but if the dps is decent you just ignore it, which is the strategy used nowadays.
---
Escort isnt a good learning place, but it serves as a "free" clear weekly and a good way to unlock masteries.
---
For a good overall mechanics training i would say vale guardian is your best friend.
---
Cairn and samarog are also very newbie friendly and fairly good to train, focusing more on dodging and reaction rather than mechanics themselves
---
Rework Chronomancer Support Wells.   
---
Please rework them and make them useful. A stationary support well that allies have to stand in for boons is a pretty terrible design when almost all other classes can generate these boons while moving.
---
Bangar will never earn similar money to Thanos though.
---
Changing attunements on ele and toggling kits on engie along with other stuff. Details on the wiki https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigil#On_weapon_swap
---
Excited for that one too. Taking a traitline for just one trait was kinda of painful....
---
In WvW it dead because you can’t use shatters without clones and the die instantly in zergs. Besides that it is still okish but odd.
---
LOL where is this from? xD
---
It's a LOT clunkier in WvW.  I switched to heal ele just to stay useful, and it's nice to play a spec that hasn't been repeatedly gutted into obsolescence for a change.
---
I did clarify I took this round much more seriously :p
---
Anet hates ranged weapons. They just nerfed revenant's hammer in pve lul
---
&gt;  Attunement change counts as weapon change. (Correct?)
---
correct
---
&gt; Does Tempest overload count as such?
---
no
---
&gt; Does every attunement change count ? (i.e. swapping to half/half vs swapping to full attunement)
---
half swap triggers the sigils
---
&gt; Kits count as weapon change, like Bomb Kit, Grenade Kit, Elixir Rifle. (Correct?)
---
&gt; Holo Photon Forge counts as weapon swap, (Correct?)
---
&gt; What if I play a Core Engineer or a Scrapper that does not use any kits? will these sigils simply never trigger?
---
correct (though you can still use conjured/environmental weapons to trigger them)
---
At least it had value in group content. Thankfully not a concern anymore.
---
Well, before it had a fuel limit. It only lasted 10 secs. If you could survive those 10 secs, you wouldn't be finished by it.
---
I could see an Elite spec for necromancer, Dirgecaller with a Mainhand(gasp) Warhorn. 1-2-3 abilities send one-shot ghost that attack and disappear, utility skills are powerful spirit minions that drain life force while active, your Shroud turns you into a spectre that doesn't attack but the abilities pump out boons/heals that have increased effect on your minions. A less selfish shroud that focuses on group support and healing that can only be seriously used when not using too many minions.
---
It’s neat. How much gold do you think you could earn from one full completion?
---
Delayed Reactions... [Vindictation!](https://old.reddit.com/r/GuildWars2Builds/comments/d7y1yv/purpose_of_delayed_reactions_mesmer_discussions/)
---
Choatic Interruption - 5 seconds. Don't get too attached people. Numbers will be iffy. The average Mesmer weapon cooldown is 19.3 seconds, standard deviation is 9.9. The median is 12. The Lowest cooldown skill is Axe's ammo charge. Also who know's how this'll interactive with Axe2 ammo and Sheild4 Deja Vu procs.
---
Seize the Moment - didn't this use to grant Quickness to allies before or am I just remembering it wrong?
---
Lost Time - I really hope they still include the damage on CC's procs.   If it's just self-Alac on Slow then my first reaction is that it'll be a garbage Grandmaster. LT will enhance Shield4, Arcane Thief, Quickness Well, Time Warp; and maybe turn Shatter3 into the Alacrity Button, similar to Bountiful Disillusionment. If it's just that it's basically force coupled to Delayed Reactions. Maybe Improved Alacrity for Alacrity out the wahzoo. There are plenty of other strongly coupled traits like Blinding Dissipation &amp; Ineptitude, Persistence of Memory &amp; Phatasmal Haste/Force. /shrug
---
Huh....that was actually a fractal build. Now in WvW.......yeah they still have to fix that.  
---
It is just, this change was at nice, at least once in a while we can be happy. I still hope they will find how to adress WvW properly....
---
They really should though. If the rules of a world are established they should be respected by players and characters that populate that world alike.
---
With that patch it will be easier to get slow cause now the support Chrono doesnt have to drop chrono phantasm (which some chronos didnt want to do because of the big dps loss)
---
Maybe not at the moment, no they arent getting removed, but the heavy-handed precedent that set the tone for the official forums will never go away. They had their chance at having a good back and forth with their community and ruined it off the presence of pride and hubris. Echo chambers like that are how we ended up with the whole Twitter fiasco, devs like Jessica Price and Peter who think that within said echo chamber they can do no wrong and fly off the handle at the first sign of someone pointing out the glaring flaws with their work. So don't tell me that it's on the players to give feedback if that's how they are treated standing by the precedent. People know what happens if they give feedback, but stopped since it was just being ignored. Who cares what the devs say is the timeframe for giving feedback? It should be an ongoing process, every single day. The spurned chance at having something nice for a discussion is long past. They made their bed, lit it on fire, and proceeded to think everything was fine while burning to death in it. They can all go play in the ashes for all I care since the situation is entirely of their own making.

Jormag is manipulative and will play into Bangar's personal fears of Aurene, and attempt to let him mirror the commander (called the champion of Aurene) the difference being that _we_ raised Aurene, while Bangar did not raise Jormag.
---
Even if it's not relevant anywhere right now, it's still a defensive option for the class. Maybe some new content will come out that makes it relevant? It's nice for trait lines to round out the build potential for a class.
---
Also, even if it's not optimal for organized content, it may still be a great choice for an individual who wants the extra defense to make pve less stressful.
---
You can only run 3 trait lines. If your benchmark for a trait line being well done is it being meta dps selection, then you'll always have 2 or 3 "bad" trait lines.
---
Very bad.
---
ham bow shout heal war was really good in pvp and wvw before they killed it
---
you'll loose bloodlust if you go into water and switch to a harpoon, even if the other weapon also has bloodlust
---
Marjory joins the chat
---
Only viable build in pvp ? Seriously ? 
---
Core SD  
---
Dash D/P  
---
Deadeye Riffle S/P  
---
Here, have 3 completely viable thief build to play that aren't condi thief.
---
Fun fact, I am actually not trolling, just appalled by this subreddit.
---
I long for the days when Reddiquette would have was a thing.
---
I mean, your comparison is meaningless? "If it doesn't earn as much as the biggest blockbuster of its year propped up by one of the biggest multimedia entertainment conglomerates it's weak"?
---
They cannot make as much money as possible if they make them free to get ! !
---
I'm wondering about Death Nova with Bone Minions as a goofy PvE power build. 60% damage increase AND it uses the necro's stats instead of the minions. Those guys might nuke pretty hard.
---
&gt; If your benchmark for a trait line being well done is it being meta dps
---
To clear that up, it is not.
---
None of them stand a chance in a solid 1v1 and gets absolutely killed if it gets targeted by players that are mobile to a meagre state.
---
I am so glad Scourge got it’s nerf after dominating the meta for so long. Let Thief shine.
---
Seems kinda OP to me. Maybe it’ll get nerfed and we’ll think of it like we used to with quickness resses
---
There you go making more blind assumptions about someone you know nothing about. Tsk tsk. That arrogance will only hurt you in the long run.
---
we don't even know if we'll ever get new elite specs. ever. we only know that anet keeps the option open, like they do with virtually everything but dungeons. almost everything is always on the table.
---
majory got the GS and started wielding it in S2, the leadup to hot, so maybe it was a hint, maybe it was just some random flavour just like every other NPC wielding unusual weapons. after all she never used any reaper abilities.
---
eir's longbow only made its way into brahams posession during HoT itself, so it can hardly be regarded as a hint for DH.
---
as other's have pointed out rytlock was wielding a pistol at one point, yet that never made it into a warrior or even rev spec.
---
while there is a chance that some dev might get inspired by seeing an NPC with a certain weapon, those chances are rather insignificant and do not warrant any speculation, especially in a situation that has as many uncertainties as this one.
---
&gt; And it's not like a shield wouldn't fit the Necromancer's tanky theme.
---
all the more reason after core, reaper, and scourge, to not give necro another "tanky" spec.
---
did... did they FINALLY un-stupid ranger sword 2? Holy shit
---
&gt; It's also the only way to avoid a repetition of Scarlet (a sylvari tempted by an Elder Dragon thinking they can build a device to control it, foiled by the Commander which inadvertently wakes it instead).
---
I might be wrong, but I don't remember Omadd's machine being a device meant to control an Elder Dragon. From my understanding it was meant as a device to view the Eternal Alchemy itself. He brought Scarlet in because his prior subjects died while trying to use it. She was more or less just another test animal (although a new kind than what he used in the past) that just happened to come in contact with a sleeping Elder Dragon. Omadd sent her out to look for what he was hoping to find, of which she did but also found something else that was much worse.
---
A little premature for that. Remember how well the Lazarus arc started and... how quickly that turned south.
---
How much damage reduction is 600 toughness? Very interesting changes for death magic, but I don't like the scourge change.
---
Pinple. The correct word is pinple.
---
Hey.
---
Did you ever stop to think that maybe
---
just playing the game doesn't actually support arenanet?
---
Not really, but making sense is good. If you care about your condi damage enough to do for burning arrows, you would go for Arms.   
---
I actually go for Arms/Tactics (for BA) and Berserker, all this for condidamage. Don't care much for Warrior's Sprint, so the change was actually pretty good for me.
---
I'm not a raider and I don't do high level T4 fractals that often. I've done everything in the game on a chrono. 
---
My guess is the more competitive you are as a player, the more those nerfs matter. The story content, and open world content I do hasn't really changed from my point of view. I mean, obviously changes have occurred, they just don't affect my gameplay.
---
you mean like cleansing orr and auto-attacking?
---
I'm sorry but no, you're just wrong. You appear to be someone that doesn't understand what ths standard power Thief builds do and how strong it already is.
---
Exactly, with the current buy price at 3500 gold for just 1 of the 3 needed skins, this is the most expensive collection in game (3\*3500 + 3\*250 for shoulders = around 11.5k gold). With these prices this is insane, previously the most expensive achievements was the chaos weapon set at 4.4k just for comparison.
---
So...let's just nerf thieves and keep them useless, nerf elementalists and make sure they're glass but never cannon?
---
But know you have the buff for 7 seconds instead of 4. That results in a buff
---
NPCs don't follow the same rules as players in regards to weapons/class. We had an NPC hint at an elite spec *once* (Marjory and Greatsword), but every other time it was nothing.
---
Thanks for confirming my prior comment.
---
Thief has been minimized to decapping and +1, that’s all. Explain it to me then. Make me understand how it has an advantage compared to other classes than it’s mobility alone.
---
And Condi war is not complete trash underwater anymore. Like you can actually reliably apply SOME condis underwater now without beeing gated behind cooldowns.
---
Tomes are just virtues with extra skills though lol.
---
If Bangar goes to enslave Jormag and somehow actually succeeds, AND does it with a plausible strategy rather than unbelievable brute force, I'll livestream myself standing up and applauding for five whole minutes straight.
---
Unless future releases also include the skins at a dramatically reduced drop rate, this will be one collection i will never attempt to complete
---
Doesn’t matter. You can run sigil of frenzy over something like accuracy or force and have near 100% uptime on Overload Air. It will basically mean the Elementalist Raid Rotation will boil down to precasting a bunch of AoE and Orb and then start permacasting Overload Air and sometimes cast Orb. There is a good chance that this will be a lot more DPS than current Weaver builds on a lot of encounters. Also, the uptime of the 10% was way lower than the uptime of this 7% which is quite absurd. 
---
I honestly am a bit shocked by this even as an Elementalist player.
---
Burning Arrows occupied the same slot as Empower Allies which always was THE prime reason to take this traitline in group content besides PS.
---
Honestly, you're probably right...
---
Not really. The options available to the players aren't the be-all and end-all. A pistol won't disappear if an ele touches it. Some people take different types of magical studies. Hell, in gw1 we had two classes, and Livia was still using her gw1 skills in s3e6
---
It already has been nerfed in PvP settings.  In PvE, you're not only invulnerable when you revive, but you're also invulnerable for a second or so when you actually go down, something else that doesn't happen in PvP anymore.
---
You seem to habe mixed up "she is prominent enough to warrant at least *some* speculation" with "this is a hint towards Necro's next elite spec weapon, prove me wrong".
---
On a sidenote, charr had a pistol since forever.
---

As others have said, try it free first. There are only minor limitations while levelling (mostly to stop bots/spammers), so until you reach max level you're not really missing out on much. 
---
If you do decide to buy, I think the deluxe version is not worth it. It's worth noting that the cost of the standard version + the value of 4000 gems (that come with the ultimate version) is almost the cost of the ultimate version, so the ultimate version is almost definitely worth it if you're going to be spending those gems. And if you want access to the full story, you'll be spending them, as you need to buy Living World seasons 2, 3, and 4 with gems. The story order goes: base game, LW1 recap (not playable unfortunately, I recommend the ~3h youtube video covering it), LW2, HoT expansion, LW3, PoF expansion, LW4, Icebrood Saga (just starting now, will be free if you make an account now and log in at least once every couple of months). 
---
Having said that, the standard version is still pretty good value for what you get. It's up to you if you want the full experience or just the main bits (in terms of non-story content; LW4 had some very major story events). I'll admit I'm biased towards the full experience route, because I'm really enjoying the story. It starts out rough (and it is pretty dated now), but just keeps improving as you play through, so don't judge it too early.

Reminds me of Journey
---
THIS IS NEVER NOT TOO SOON. even all these years later :(
---
I hope us warriors get an elite shout called “Nerds” that allows us to hit firebrands with their stupid books
---
Well, this subreddit is pretty ridiculous when it comes to downvoting people because their opinion differs slightly from the small-minded bandwagon, but your comment didn't really make any sense.
---
It's fine as a DPS class and awkward, clunky garbage as a support class.  It can still work in organized groups, but when compared to a well-played Fire-Brigade (Firebrand + Renegade) it is much, ***much*** less pug-friendly to play with.  Both Alacrigade &amp; Firebrand are much more generous and frequent in their radius and ability to provide Quickness &amp; Alacrity.  
---
ArenaNet runs a very fine line sometimes.  Their goal is to highlight other options or "**balance**" the game, but they have a difficult time balancing satisfaction and fun as part of that balance equation.  The unfortunate result of that is that any class -- Chrono being the current poster child -- that's out of sync with the rest of the game is gradually eroded and ruined via clunky, unsatisfying and often tone-deaf re-works that take all the joy out of playing Chrono as a support.
---
Why do i always get this unsatisfying itching whener there are balance patches coming...
---
There's no overall vision or guiding principles for balance unfortunately.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't think it'll be an equal alliance. It's just that I originally thought the manipulation would end with his corruption and then he'd be completely controlled by Jormag (and not really be "Bangar" anymore), but now I'm thinking that Jormag will let Bangar be himself, and will instead trust that Bangar will carry out what Jormag wants (due to continuing manipulation).
---
It's just healthy fear of The Great Randomness.
---
Desmina uses hammer, does this mean we'll get that too?
---
they may be hints, like when they did it with belinda's gs on marjory, but don't take them so seriously, we always had tons and tons of npcs with strange weaponset.
---
Like canach with grenades, rytlock with offhand pistol, npcs with spears on land, someone may even use focus on main hand with the beer glass skin.. don't think about it.
---
Did it try to finish you again if it got interrupted within that 10 seconds? I'm not very familiar with the old functionality.
---
The change to greatsword crippling throw makes me very sad.  Great utility in that skill.  I don't think that was the right direction to go for the weapon.
---
I'm still confused on seeing rytlock becoming the first revenant and showing only glint in hot story..
---
she wielded gs without showing any reaper skill or hint.
---
she just had that, like braham got the fire shooting lbow on ls3.
---
Then it becomes insane in wvw because Scourge + Blood Magic already carries groups in wvw.
---
Mannn, GW2 does mounts so much better than any other game, especially this mount and the Skyscale.. the way they move is incredible. GW2 is just gd amazing, love the game.
---
And what of his wife?
---
Not that death magic in this form even comes close to soul reaping or spite for reaper, but why did they have to make the mechanic revolve around toughness, making it next to useless for raider who would never want to take 600 extra toughness and make a tanks life hard? How hard is it to just use percent reduction and make it usable by PvP and PvE?
---
Oh. Was I supposed to enjoy it?
---
$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
ANET, let me choose to hold Ventari’s tablet for fucks sake!
---
People refuse to even acknowledge the legendary centaur exists!
---
Just do what I did and go back to playing City of Heroes.
---
Take off the blindfold silly
---
300 power doesnt compete with 10% bonus damage and 300 ferocity, completely forgetting the point that 600 toughness in PvE either means nothing or it means you just made your tank have to find 600 more toughness (ie. youre asked to change trait lines)--also dont forget 15% shroud recharge timer. Just an all around weaker PvE line.
---
oh and I think one of the charr NPC from the personal story claims to be(or said to be by someone else, it's been a while) a necromancer, dual wields swords and uses mesmer skills
---
I don't think that will be the case. Tempest burst was always higher than Weavers in the first 30 sec and overload air still only hits with all hits on large/huge hitbox. You will kill trash faster than before (in fractals for example) But in most of the fractals Tempest was superior over weaver allready.   
---
Still mostly like the changes on tempest. But it is sad that lesser sandsquall is gone. + we lost 60(!!!) conc. So both Boon Tempest variants (Power and Condi) will suffer from lesser boon uptime. But maybe the increased DPS will still make them viable.
---
That is beautiful.
---
Healing warrior? I'm looking forward to it \^\^
---
&gt; Chaotic Interruption - 5 seconds. Don't get too attached people. Numbers will be iffy. The average Mesmer weapon cooldown is 19.3 seconds, standard deviation is 9.9. The median is 12. The Lowest cooldown skill is Axe's ammo charge 6s (followed by Mirror Blade and Illusionary Counter at 8s). Also who know's how this'll interactive with Axe2 ammo and Sheild4 Deja Vu Procs.
---
I’m sure most vet mesmer players will be using it mostly to recharge chaotic interruption.
---
&gt; Seize the Moment - didn't this use to grant Quickness to allies before or am I just remembering it wrong
---
You were remembering it wrong
---
&gt; Lost Time
---
I suppose what’s also interesting is that chrono has to choose between Alacrity uptime or Quickness uptime for grandmaster. But seeing as Chrono hasn’t really had issues with uptime of either boon in good groups, I think people will still use Chronophantasma unless they’re on Minstrel for which it won’t matter what they choose.
---
Maybe I will look at Sword now. I always played Dagger/Axe on pSB. Damage was almost the same and Sword was just weird to use.
---
I never noticed the reference until this post pointed it out... I feel like I'm no longer a hardcore fan anymore.
---
I think I know who's that charr but I don't remember the name, one of the guy who follow your character in story mission.
---
I think she's just drunk or crazy tho
---
where will your bruiser build be good?
---
Scrapper is non-existent in high end PvE and PvP.
---
Plus they already die nearly instantly in WvW.  Anyone that knows how to cleave (or downed players that can push 1) just melts them right away.  Anet just has no idea how to balance player-controlled AI in this game.  Look at the ride we we've gone on with spirit weapons and animals.
---
you can't read seems like.
---
Is there a way to disable one specific sound file? Im playing through PoF for the first time and enjoying it but when in greener areas there is one bird(?) background whistle that drives me insane. Never had that in game before and I love the sound design so disabling  ambient all together is a bit sad.
---
Its like someone whistles in your ear 3 times in a row and is constant in the areas it is appearing. I even found some older threads of people complaining about the same thing. At first I was shocked and thought they added it to my mini, but no, it is supposed to be ambient... ambient torture maybe x)
---
Ranger main here. I'm gonna miss them lots :&lt;
---
Three if you dual wield two pistols.
---
YOU MONSTER!
---
Hmmmm no, still nothing.
---
if youre about to place shades, just gotta make sure to get one under your feet as well pretty much.
---
if only firebrigade didnt do everything 10x better with  2x more dmg XD
---
Pet swap traits aren't applied to you, unless you figured out a way to swap yourself.  
---
If you did, please share the information
---
" **terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time** "
---
I just hope they're actually trying to balance it. You know, make more than just one weapon set meta for each elite spec/class
---
I mean, you could always just play Mirage instead unless you were dead set on Chrono and shields. Staff mirage is solid in open world, there are condi DPS builds for raids; Mirage is still good in PVP, I don't know about it's state in WvW if that's where your interest is though.
---
They probably consider the minions already 'group stuff', since they take aggro away from players and act as cover from non-penetrating projectiles.
---
ye that 30k dps bannerslave is trash,better take sb for some h3333ls and mights!!!!
---
Is the prologue different if you play through it as a charr?
---
Chrono is great at just about everything except for WvW, where it truly does struggle. You'll hear doom and gloom about it in other modes, but it's just because whereas it used to be absolutely godly, it's been brought down to just "fine" these days. 
---
In PvE, where i spend all my time, Chrono is fine. It excels in open world because it gives itself powerful boons and deals very high damage. In 5-man content it takes a little too long to ramp up damage, but it makes a fine support even if there are better options these days. In raids, it excels at both damage and support. 
---
It's no longer best-of-the-best in all areas, but it's a very powerful and very useful class.
