Oh, wow. I did not expect that kind of write-up. And GOOD LORD I did NOT expect that amount of work being put in the game! I thought it's more like SW:TOR. A hollow flesh puppet full of the publisher's cum, being shoved down poor people's throat.
---
And thanks for not spoiling the story, much appreciated. ;)
---
I'm actually checking if my ten year old account still exists...
---
So I absolutely love the way the starter armor looks so is there a way I can keep the look while freely changing my armor?
---
Polyluminescent can be combo with every infusion except itself.
---
Skin change like Snow Diamond, Ember and Celestial cannot stack.
---
I currently didnt have access to my GW2, sorry but I experiment a lot about those infusion. You could combo Snow Diamond with Polyluminescent to get skin color similar to Chest Skin. But the skin and Chest, the color will be the one of Polyluminescent and it effect all other gear colors.
---
But where's Blish üò•
---
Honestly, I want exactly what the arcdps one is... but in the game. I want to be able to save files (since stats are static and don‚Äôt change) that are like ‚Äúberserker xyz pieces in abc slots, etc etc‚Äù that we can send to people, and have them be able to just load it, like gw1 skill templates were. 
---
If you buy both expansions and both Living Story episode packs (gemstore), you get 6+ years of content for ~65‚Ç¨.
---
You can buy the episodes for gold, too, but it'd take around 1200 gold to get them all. You CAN skip on Season 2 to lower the price tag, if you want to. It provides nothing but content and lore but no important rewards or anything, and is significantly lower quality than season 3 or 4.
---
Akili is mostly just filler event, you don't really get that much from champ bags.

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
I refuse to pump any additional money into product with quests, instances and dungeons broken and unfixed since day1.
---
I actually can't go back to the old ways now... Guild Wars' heart system has broken me for other games :P
---
JP wasn't an accident but an inevitable consequence. People warned anet she's trouble when they hired her. Year was enough for her to prove reddit was right :)
---
One problem for this for a chrono, scholar‚Äôs 10% buff does not affect the phantasms, the main power damage of a mesmer.
---
That said, you bet your bottom dollar I‚Äôm excited for it.
---
There's a reason she pushed anet ceo to sign a decision to run away from reddit after JP drama. People here saw through her lies, but on forums she has full power to execute her nazi state rules. Now she can create an echochamber for herself to smile to during lonely evenings with her cat and mental illness.
---
Were you around when danger time got buffed? If not, it not affects phantasms which is obviously super strong. Power Chrono danger time builds are potentially extremely strong if the setup can be done correctly. I don't think mirage was changed. Also, in that same patch SoI was changed to only increase the duration of everyone's boons by 5 seconds (not scaling with boon duration). This means power Chrono can run SoI and help with boon uptime if necessary, and mirage could too but Chrono can more easily.
---
Do you mean the armor in the character creation screen? Or the level 1 armor? If the former, you will have to get that armor set in game first, which may be pretty expensive. If the latter, you will need transmutation charges for every armor piece you change out. It isn't easily done and isn't really practical.
---
buy both expansions; as their respective elite specializations will give provide very different playstyles (e.g. Druid = healer vs Soulbeast = DPS for Ranger)
---
if I recall correctly; each expansion comes with 1 character slot; + 5 from the base game; so you'll have 7 if you buy both; giving you *plenty* of space to try different classes.
---
I don't really think this matches the feel of the Fractal of the Mists lobby, it's too upbeat.  
---
Fractals of the Mists is a dangerous place that, if you follow the story, can be pretty heartbreaking.  
---
This music is too whimsical. It fits the open-world or player story better.
---
herald shield would like a word.
---
Whoa there, m8. How was anything I said negative?
---
You got some hostility issues? Seek help. 
---
Well done. I love seeing how creative people get with in-game cosplay.
---
I've never once had to count to know the stage of an autoattack chain I'm in. I find trying to play like that kind of weird.
---
It's like counting the bullets in your clip in a shooter game, or taking your eyes off the field to look at the ammo counter in the corner. I hide those if I can. 
---
It's better to get used to the rhythm instead. Like when dancing. You'll know how many bullets are left because that's what's feels is the next step in the dance.
---
2 slabs of sheet metal, 4 propeller blades, 10 nuts, 14984 bolts.

Quite big thread on basically situation you are in:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac0ons/players_moving_to_gw2_after_the_colossal_failure/
---
As for my opinion:
---
1. Combat system
---
2. Dynamic i guess, non grindy, NOT PW2!!!
---
3. Try to play normally, but if you get stuck with how boring leveling can be (at least for me. i leveled only 1 character normal way and that was at release of GW2 and even that was partially in WvW), you can boost to lv 80 (you get 1 boost per expansion and well there are other ways to get instant levels, but not on your first character). 
---
Many will say it's not good to boost, because you will be overwhelmed, but i mean, if you struggle to find leveling fun, why not boost and read some stuff on wiki/reddit/forum and be done with it.
---
That FF bow looks like almost an entire Exalted, which actually wouldn't be that strange. 
---
Lol okay dude. 
---
Cool, thanks for your thoughts
---
The base game is free to play so you have nothing to lose. I myself love gw2.
---
There were Wintersday sales in both the official game store and the the in-game gemstore.
---
Or just a selectable template of key bindings. Say a set of 10 and you just select which one you want active. I love it. 
---
Probably worth mentioning that expacs are on big sale on amazon, don't miss it out if you plan to invest some more time.
---
I'd love this alternative as well. I think it's better even, I could do different keybinds on the same character, maybe?
---
So q combination of the two best bow skins in the game with additional effects and footfalls? Sounds great to me!
---
They do. You can't expect it next week though. It falls into a que in ANets workflow and that's even if they think it's good or feasible.
---

---
Herald shield is good.
---
not that there's much to see in that screen, helmet is in the way XD.  
---
Celestial+winter heart seems to make a light blue skin texture in contrast to the cyan skin of the zodiac, it still may work for the design I've in mind, thank you.
---
If you may post a screen without the helmet it'll be appreciated \^ \^  
---
I really wish that they kept Zhaitan's original size that was planned. It's not quite Kralkatorrik's size (about half Kralk's size), but it's still a [proper "Elder Dragon" size](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Elder_Dragons_size_comparison.png) IMO, and fits being smaller than Kralk since there's been long speculation (or dev statements? Not sure) that Kralkatorrik is meant to be the largest of the Elder Dragons (ironically, Primordus was supposed to be the smallest).
---
Primordus I kind of wish was smaller. The front two thirds of his head is as big as Kralk's head and neck, and that's just silly for an Elder Dragon who moves about underground. His breathing should be causing aftershocks at that size, and him going from the Central Transfer Chamber to Ring of Fire alone should have collapsed Kryta and/or the Sea or Sorrows in a massive sinkhole trench. And that says nothing about the redesign from a unique tendril-covered Elder Dragon of sharp, sheen rocks to the super generic massive underjaw crocodilian head that's very reminiscent of Deathwing from WoW.
---
And I agree, no repeat of the Zhaitan fight. And let us actually fight Kralkatorrik, not witness the grand battle in the distance while we did something else.
---
You must be burnt out. Its time to quit Gw2.
---
The Position on the Back is pretty fuck. There  are so many 2H Weapons with the same Shit. The best example for the Position problem is Wings of Dwayna (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Wings_of_Dwayna.jpg). not even the new legendary longbow make any effort to adapt it properly to the back position. really sad.
---
Why the dagger ? It's heavily condi oriented.
---
You could get a keyboard that has profile keys. I have a Logitech G710 where I can set 3 diff profile keybinds on the G-keys. 
---
Download it and see if you like it. The base vanilla GW2 went free to play (with some restrictions to deter botting) and if you like the game then buy an expansion to get the extra content and remove F2P restrictions 
---
Took me a moment to get it, but to be fair, I usually let Kaiden die on Virmire so I don't see that line often.
---
When you compare buying gem store skins with gold to dying. Ok.
---
We saw a silhouette of his full body in the PoF ending cinematic. It was basically the Shatterer's body (broken up wings included) with Kralk's head.
---
BUt that was 100% placeholder.
---
All other map reward tracks are repeatable but not the Silverwastes reward track. Would be a nice way for PvP'ers and WvW'ers to earn shovels for their guild hall.
---
Agreeing with others - forget the 'holy trinity' of tank/dps/healer. The devs literally designed the game to smash that idea, it was a selling point during development hype and at release. It has slowly been moving more towards that due to elite specializations making classes more niche, but no matter what you pick you don't have to be pigeonholed into a role because - especially with the elite specs - every class is fairly flexible. Regardless of class, don't \*ever\* try to facetank damage, it is not like any other MMO in that respect. Dodging is there for a reason - learn it, love it, live.
---
I second the suggestions that you take characters out to the PvP lobby so you can try out all of your options with the training golems. Wishing you the best in finding something that works for you!
---
A lot of these things (aside from footfalls) have applied to black lion weapons in some form or another. With black lion weapon skins blurring the line between legendary skins and normal skins, I expect legendary weapons to have a bit more effort put into them. I literally can't tell the difference between the projectiles fired by this bow and the projectiles fired by every Dragonhunter with a longbow. It doesn't have any real presence or theme other than "it glows, look how shiny it is." 
---
I expect legendary weapons to have some sort of significance, to be instantly recognizable as a legendary. After I saw the trailer for the first time, and was scrolling through a thread about it, I saw talk of the new legendary longbow. I then had to re-watch the trailer because I completely missed it the first time. 
---
Tp for more... Also some achievements and dailies award different types of envelopes.
---
Download it and see if you like it. The base vanilla GW2 went free to play (with some restrictions to deter botting) this is the entire classic compaign, classic world bosses, dungeons and fractals. if you like the game then buy an expansion to get the extra content and remove F2P restrictions
---
Wow, very interesting read! Nice to know 
---
Doesn't solve weapon skills
---
Sounds like you asked if grieving was meta on firebrand.
---
Modifier keys do
---
If you're using the RES extension, you can already do it.
---

---
DONT DELETE OLD CHARACTERS!
---
The birthday presents can be super cool, so let them roll in and use a new char slot
---
I really don't like the sword on ranger and up until the last patch the dagger was considered as a good option for the power build (the main hand weapon doesn't matter much aside from a few chains of autoattack in the rotation), so until things settle after the next supposedly meta-changing patch I'm keeping it as is.
---
Well done.  
---
You could mix up to 4 dye colors per weapon for a lot more variation than "12 dyes" suggests. The vast majority of weapon skins could be dyed, and "only in specific places" is how dyes work in GW2 as well, so there's no excuse there.
---
One change I'd definitely like to see is -20% cooldown to Symbol of Energy (12s, down from 15s), so that with alacrity it could be cast twice per weapon swap with no delay when swapping off of longbow.
---
I‚Äôd try to avoid teal personally, as it‚Äôd change the armor itself too. 
---
GS is the best, especially in PvE content. It's a ranger's best friend.
---
It‚Äôs an OLDDDDDD photo, but I got the transmutation charges and the infusions to set it back up again! I‚Äôll do it tonight after work. (Like, 5 hours out minimum)
---
Needs more glowy particles imo
---
Care to explain please?
---
Sword is more frontloaded though, making it better at places where Power Soulbeast shines most.
---
13.000 hours here, my characters don't shine.
---
I have well over 15K hours and you won't see any of my characters look like that visual diarrhea. 
---
They look like completely different, way more stylish, visual diarrhea.
---
And what if I want a separate key for Air Attunement, Citadel Bombardment and Diversion? They're all under Profession Skill 3.
---
meh i like pistol more.  Of course I understand your complaint, doesn't change the fact that pistol at least in one niche sees the light of day in pve.  There are a lot of weapons that can't be said for, it would be nice for Anet to balance them so players have more options to choose a play style they prefer.  But again, at least we get to use it at one fight not zero.  
---
Then you adapt your own playstyle to accomodate a single key press because you are playing so many classes
---
But it's not. Axe is actually the most frontloaded mainhand 
---
I would like them to move to Ebonhawke and Snarl just oogles at human females at the inn all day while Galina drags him back home.
---
youre that dude. i always stare at your char on mistlock sanctuary.
---
Actually dagger is more frontloaded because it synergizes better with OWP. It simly has more attacks per second and even pulls ahead in some situatons. Very slightly though.
---
dont recommend it while levelling. Its a waste of transmutaion shards. 
---
That's how mafia works
---
I will pop in and say that I think legendaries need strong themes. Aside from specific things like footfalls, that's all that really sets legendaries apart from gem store weapons these days which are loaded on with the sorts of effects that were reserved for legendaries in the past. However I'm definitely not as down on this as many others are, I think it looks okay and I also know these previews don't always do the weapons justice.
---
Unbelievable, my account still exists. Downloading takes ages though. I wonder if my character is still around.
---
Never mind the expenses, I won't spend any money on it I guess. Just play a bit through the story and content available to me. Assuming the game is actually playable and unlike you-know-who. Sounds though as if it is.
---
Chances are that I am indeed going to pester you ingame should I stick around for a while and/or fail horrifyingly at getting my bearings.
---
this. I don't know why anyone would want such mess of keybinds... I have one mouse profile for gw2, i play every class with it, multiple builds even on each class (5 on guard, 4 on necro, 3 on rev, 4 on ranger...) and I have no issues.
---
I'm hoping that the mists will warp his body for a great surprise look. Also, the Zhaitan fight was supposed to be super different but was scrapped because lack of time. 
---
No reason to act like a child.
---
I don't have trouble learning to cast Citadel Bombardment by holding a modifier and double-tapping a key, because of a keybind I have made for my main ele for Air Attunement. But a nice QoL would be an option to use that mod+key to something more useful while playing Renegade.
---
MY EYES MY EYES, KORMIR SAVE ME 
---
Male character sexist? 
---
What's the armor set and infusions? That looks absolutely hilarious
---
Could also fit into an army hospital? I'd imagine the Black Citadel has no shortage of charr, who need to be stitched back together, be it from the enemy, or simply accidental discharge. Having a reference for how a healthy charr's organism *should* look like could help the doctors and nurses greatly.
---
Leveling: Crafting gives you some Experience towards levelling up using materials you've gathered or purchased.
---
* Armorsmith/Leatherworker/Tailor:  You can make armor appropriate for your level.  
---
* Artificer, Hunsman, Weaponsmith: You can make weapons approriate for your level.  
---
* Jeweler: You can make trinkets appropriate for your level.
---
* Chef: You can make food and potions appropriate for your level that will help you in combat and give you more experience per kill.

Are you playing on a potato or is that really the model anet out for the dog whistle?
---
They were on sale for like 3/4 of the year. It's not "sad" to not make it a full year of sales. 
---
I also look for a nice group to stay with. Tbh i can't easily find a group i can basically get along with until some afterthoughts nagg my mind. I left my last guild on WoW since they left me alone in an dungeon instead of waiting 2-3 more minutes to let me fill the missing slot via a premade tool.
---
Also im a clueless chicken ingame and have made not much progress since when i last time played it was still dungeon farming for the best gear (pre exp).  So an guiding hand might come in handy here. 
---
And yes i am an BFA Survivor / refugee.
---
For straight up levels that you gain from crafting, its useless to train crafting to make weapons for yourself for levelling, its jut a money loss. 
---
Well then you don't have 150% crit damage. You should be closer to 200.
---
If you are doing Spellbreaker, use Strength/Discipline. Mainhand axe unless you need dagger for boonstrip or mobility (such as during the towers event in DS), offhand axe, Greatsword. Otherwise Strength/Disciple/Tactics with same set.
---
One Sigil of Accuracy per weapon set is a good investment, it's worth a lot of precision.
---
If you are concerned about defensive stats, work towards Marauder ascended armor.
---
I can't get Intact Mosaics to drop. I did 64 Legendary bounties today and didn't get a single Intact Mosaic. The drop rate must have been sunk through the floor.
---
It's a bit of a prisoners dilemma. People defending it are different from people doing it.
---
You use emojis in reddit, that's more concerning.
---
This is the reason why Balthazar turned on us
---
I meant you.

Also self-quickness witg trait interaction. Alot less cleave though, which might be a problem in some scenarios.

I'm sorry, where's the character? I only see Truth from full metal alchemist.

Welcome and hope to see you around! 
---
It looks amazing. looking forward to trying it out. One thing i'd love to see (You probably implemented it already) is a tracking list for crafting, What materials are you missing and what materials you have on hand, that'd would be incredible.
---
i just realized i used the one with the transparent bg in this post, mind if i repost with the other one ?
---
There is some research on the wiki for gleam: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fluctuating_Mass/Drop_rate

I don't know of any for mawdrey or princess.

Yeah OK you win at gw2 endgame :o 
---
I also want to be able to set keybinds for mounted abilities since we're soon going to get a third ability. I'd rather bind that to a mouse key while mounted, but I want to keep my skill keybinds as they are.
---
Also from my limited playing of the game the increase in hours played has a direct impact on the levels of toxicity and asshole behavior. 
---
challenge was presented and accepted :P
---
this is amazing
---
That rubber band sound. hhhnng
---
Go for it.  I'll spam comment in the morning.  
---
Thanks again &lt;3
---
Shut your god damn mouth, you.
---
I'm so sorry for the delay; I've had a lot going on. Thank you for the reply. I enjoy grouped content but I don't know anyone that plays the game so I end up doing zergs by myself.  I guess with ascended gear I don't know why I am doing it? It doesn't look especially good which is what motivates me in the game.
---
I really like the the Eclipe and Healing Heir. I playing a Necromancer right now. I have all the expacs. Have played since beta. 
---
It'll work until they log into the game and see how toxic the community is. When they try to do a dungeon and the entire group is Sonic wannabe's going RUSH RUSH RUSH RUSH RUSH SPEED OF LIGHT GOTTA GO FAST!!!1!!!!
---
Wtf
---
&gt;But why does it outperform, lets say, sword in melee is completely beyond me.
---
Well, probably because it doesn't.
---
&gt;fullrifle build completely justifies it's effectiveness and range with its restrictions and complexity. 
---
That's possibly the first time I have ever seen anybody describe DE rifle rotation as "complex" or "restrictive". Congratulations.
---
Really looking forward to the range circles feature, even though. Guess it would show when mousing over a skill like in a MOBA, even for skills that aren't point-target?
---
Eh, a girl told me I text boring back in middle school so I always sprinkle in something to spice up my messages. Although I use Reddit on my iPhone so I always have some emojis right there
---
No one is watching GW2 tbh. There are only few hundreds of gamers out of millions in my country know GW2 existence.
---
How many years ago was that? Seriously, this is really fascinating to me. I can't imagine taking advice from most teenage girls on how to communicate.   
---
I don't intend to make fun of you or anything, it's just the idea of advice received in middle school about using emojis in text sticking for years is really, really interesting.
---
No trouble at all, FvD is one of the best guilds I have the pleasure of being in. Thanks for inviting me laaaaast time Kuei :)
---
The only reasonable way to buff DH LB is to replace the weapon skills and ES traits. It's dumb how much of the functionality of the bow depends on multiple traits to play right. Unlike the Axe for Firebrand.
---
When you see this - I love you. I hope you like it. You are my most favorite charr and definitely the prettiest one around. 
---
Sword weaver is a huge slap on the face of the traditional elemental mage ranged caster. It's like you are a nimble assassin with crazy elemental attacks. I love it. 
---
*shrugs*
---
I've also yet to receive a gift.
---
It's like 1 more day? or a few hours before the event ends. No, I get what some people may try to say and whatnot, but it is still disappointing to not get a gift as that's kind of the whole point of a "Secret Santa" event.
---
though
---
Happy Holidays to everyone! and to my giftees and accidental giftees (haha).
---
its the reserved slot for the upcoming cauliflower infusion
---
Ah right; it doesn't read the game's memory.
---
Anet should hire you to be the new game UI developer tbh.
---
The light...it‚Äôs finite :(

Hey, they said they were gonna name their first kid after me. I sure as hell want to see a little cub named "Commander".

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Commander
---
So how can I go about using this? Beta testing? Open?
---
Just WOW!!!! Your HUD is brilliant. And it doesn't lose the feeling of the game which is fantastic.
---
I cant wait for the release.
---
neh really it's not worth it at all don't waste your time honestly.in fact this game suck in every single aspect don't even think about giving a try. and anyway it's not like you can download it for free and discover a massive amount of content that will answer all your questions above.    
---
I swap between thief and necro when I play WvW, I ALWAYS forget to swap my key bindings around till I get into the first fight and then realize my terrible mistake. 
---
Can PVP skins such as mistforged skins be used in PVE?
---
Ah dang :( I guess I will never know
---
I dont think it should be hard to code. My point is that it seems like such a niche feature so it probably won't happen and maybe you should seek a different, non-built-in solution. Similar to the build template issue, it's not in the game so someone made a solution for it and whoever wants the feature uses the plugin.
---
and my apologies for saying it's a mess, obviously, if you're making a post about it here it's because it's not a mess to you and you care about it. I'm sorry.
---
No reason to be snide. In OP's defense a lot of games seem really cool at the start, but have big issues end game that only experienced players would know about. 
---
It was wise of him to come and ask.....
---
You cant get mounts until you're max level (80) and have the expansion Path of Fire. You can use abilutues that give you swiftness to help you get around faster though. 
---
This is basically what everyone had to do like a year and a half ago, haha.
---
Am I lame if I like the 10 hour one the most?!
---
That isn't especially reliable in a game where attack animations and cooldowns can be both sped up and slowed down by boons and conditions, many of which you can't control yourself directly.
---
Damn, how long does it normally take to reach level 80?
---
You were correct. Though I had them in that order to begin with.
---
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-0-9
---
The songs which I played were played correctly way before I put them in my novelty section (I played them a lot) They always sounded fine. As soon as I put them in my novelties it messes up some of the notes.
---
My bound keys for playing were always 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-0-9
---
I just tried switching the 9 and 0 which plays the song in an even more lower octave just to see if that was the problem. (Maybe they had switched it when you put your instruments in your novelty tab) but nope, the problem is still there. Thank you though, I'll try to mess around to see which note is being messed up.
---
Ugly Charr meta. 
---
Only in PvP.
---
Or anywhere else. I've seen it everywhere really.
---
I mean there are quite a few DE raiders out there, so I don't know about this "basically no one" thing. They aren't played on power-resistant bosses, but other than that? They are still best in slot on most fights. 
---
I mean, you do realize they don't have to dodge to gain stealth, right?
---
Scepter out-DPSes sword on completely stationary targets, which is mostly just golems and wing 1/2. Sword does much better against mobile targets and for add phases, so it's an important distinction. Scepter is simply not the best pick all the time. 
---
First generation is the easiest once you have your crafting leveled up. I have almost a dozen first gen, and one second gen that almost made me rage quit. 20k each of  elder wood and mythril was a bit of a haul. 
---
In simpler terms it works similarly to Taco :) 
---
Yeah, I want a 2nd gen one so bad. Actually the 2nd gen Scepter and Torch. I started this morning. I need to get the gift of blood, totem, etc.
---
Yeah! :) 
---
Yes babyyy
---
Volatile magic shipments for cheap trophies.
---
Gw2timer or gw2efficiency for those rich nodes of plat and iron. And elder wood places.
---
Do all 3(-4) hot metas each day for 4 gemstones. Anomaly for mystic coin.
---
See cheap forges for gemstones.
---
If you start now and do little each day and don't sell stuff, you will be fine.
---
Hell yeah! Thanks, metas are the world events? Sorry, still new trying to figure all the lingo.
---
elementalist scepter is great. actually, fire is the clunkiest and most useless element on scepter
---
Last as in this is the last thing the game needs to make it perfect for me.
---
had no clue this existed till me and a friend tried it out. located in suns refuge \^\^
---
Anet get in here, these are the kind of QoL stuff I want to see! amazing stuff cant wait to try it out.
---
My hammer slipped ...
---
Where the fuck are their arms?! 
---
Oh. Found them. Still I can't unsee the armless Charr. 
---
Nice none the less :D
---
&gt; Also why would i want to watch someone farm herbs for 10 hours on stream or something similiar. 
---
meanwhile stardew valley has around 60% more viewers than GW2 :)
---
Apparently infinite light isn't infinite...maybe rename extended light? :D
---
&gt;Here is snowcrows description of it for the record:
---
"It has a simple to gear build but with a punishing rotation"
---
"This build is not very beginner friendly due to the rotation requiring extreme precision. If you mess up this rotation it will be very hard to get back on track."
---
Yes if you are really good with the build you can do well. That's completely besides the point. Your claims of it not being complex or restrictive seem to fly in the face of all evidence - both opinions from the experts and how many people actually successfully play it.
---
This completely misses the original point made by the OP that ranged weapons should not = dps. There are several much easier rifle Deadeye rotations that deal 2-3k less DPS than the "perfect" Snowcrows rotation and are still miles ahead of most other power builds in terms of total damage output *and* burst. 
---
You don't have to be good with this build, you can be perfectly mediocre and still do just fine, certainly better than any flavor of Guardian.
---
But the Elder Dragons *are* singular entities. Even Mordremoth was, albeit in a different manner of a hive mind form.
---
Very interested in using this! Make sure to post when it‚Äôs ready :)
---
so that is 11 hours from now?
---
nah, I've got ~4000 hours under my belt and my character looks like the 10 hour one
---
Yup!  Hope to see you there.
---
Good points. About ED-s being hiveminds, I meant that Zhaitan had the most complex command structure in his army. By far he had the largest army of any ED, and probably most powerful too. He had a organized navy, supply lines that were bringing corpses and artifacts to Orr. No other ED has displayed that (except Mordremoth with prisoner caravans).
---
i'd love to, i only have 5 LI but would love to earn more in some of the newer raids
---
I think you should point out that there are different ways to level a character, as almost everything you do in the game throw exp or leveling tomes at you :D even map completion is not that important, you just need to run around doing events and get points of interest and vistas!
---
I always told my friends "oh, just skip the hearts completely if you find it boring. Maybe try out pvp once in a while, even if you lose a couple of games, you get access to all traits and skills so you can start learning your class. Or follow a crafting guide, that also make you level up a bit"
---
I guess they are too used to the old "game pls tell me what to do or else I will get bored", and then get bored after a couple of fetch quests or "kill 348 bad monsters" quests. At least hearts are somewhat original, you can complete them in many ways (some ways are more effective than others, just look at how fast the bar fills... I figured this out the first day I played, how can they not do them fast while waiting for events to spawn?) and most important of all hearts don't clutter you freaking HUD as much as quests do!
---
The only thing I can understand getting people away from the game is the lack of gear progression, which by the way is one of the main reasons I exclusively play this mmorpg... I prefer grinding for fashion instead B) sorry for the long ass post.  
---
TL;DR: "skip hearts if they're boring you dummy, you can level up in different ways"
---
Well hopefully this will be a good match for you :) Before forming the Discord over a year ago, I too only have 3 Vale Guardian kills and 1 Gorseval kill. Now I have two sets of legendary armor :D
---
I would LOVE if more information like this was disclosed
---
Yea shouldve mentioned all these things. Theyre already far lost though. Whenever I bring up Gw2 again they start blocking and make it clear they dont like the game and wont try it again. So yeah, now that I actually got back into gw2 again after a break, I should look for a nice group or guild ingame instead of trying to convince my rl friends x)
---
it's so beautiful :'-)  
---
if it was only a sylvari it would have became perfect (my main is a sylvari necro).
---
10 hours best hours 
---
Ah crap I was really hoping that would be it. Sorry I couldn't help. I hope you get it figured out friend!
---
Silverwastes, Verdant brink, Auric Basin, and Tangled depths are all "single use".  Once you complete them, you have access to Magumma Wastes and Heart of Magumma tracks that are repeatable. 
---

---
Guildhalls are better than this.
---
There should ne aliances and GvG in future So i will surely try that üòä
---
ur fricking title man, its confusing me
---
tho that requires joining the guild :/ this wont - either way still hoping for a fully open dual system eventually\^ 
---
Thank you for doing your part fellow nine year old. 
---
I love this, and I've been having a lot of fun and a lot of laughs dueling my brother in it. Gives another great reason to use Sun's Refuge too, which I love. SR is what our home instance should have been. 
---
I can vouch for this, I have 8k hours too and my characters look like that.
---
I tried doing that but one treasure ches only seem to give about 3 contracts. That‚Äôs quite little. I need thousands to complete the harrier trinkets :/
---
Maaan I thought this was tentacles mother emracool.
---
World Boss Portal Device is so annoying, as it always pops up under the inventory window where you opened it from!
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat.  The 100 hour one doesn‚Äôt look too bad imo either.  But extremely flashy just looks gaudy imo, and crazy wings is a trademark of the over the top f2p korean mmos and I really have grown to loath them (though GW2 has started moving in that direction with their visual design)
---
Nah you don't need to be a member, only need to have HoT. My guildies bring random folks they meet off of WvW into the guild hall every so often for duel sessions.
---
Just need to be in the party with a guild member to enter the guild hall, either through a wp or the front entrance in the map.
---
oh didnt know that, thanks!
---
eh, not like the game runs well even on a nasa computer
---
That is awesome, can't wait until the full release. 
---
Horrible argument.
---
People could as easily say "come 1v1 me in my dueling server/GH/Sun's Refuge" now, just that it would be more inconvinent.
---
And people could just as easily reply "no thanks."
---
Also, yu could just Block the guy.
---
Guessed it'd be worth it to start from the beginning, going through TOS, TNG, DS9. Not sure if I have to play them all manually or if they lead into each other, but I'll find that out sooner or later.
---
Game's heavily dated, but going pew pew against mongol klingons is actually fun. I'll let you know once I reach lvl10. Thanks for reminding me of STO, mate!
---
I pay myself the games i play
---
FED/TOS/DSC are all the same after around level 10. It's essentially just different tutorials. Standard FED is in 2409. TOS in TOS, DSC in DSC. So instead of going through the 2409 tutorial and that, you do it in one of those and they do have extra exclusive missions and gear for starting in those but eventually you move onto the same story as everyone else.
---
Most of the story you'll play at first is all the made for the game stuff for this but you'll hear Spock introduce you to each region and your level ups. Voyager and DS9 both have their own specific expansions and storylines to go through. TNG cast members are in a few different episodes around different story-lines, some of which I think are now in a separate optional mission section.
---
It still has the dated feel especially when leveling. End-game and all of the stuff made the last few years is a lot more enjoyable but have to go through the old stuff first lol. And glad you're enjoying it!
---
Don't worry, they all already follow the business model of overpriced gambling boxes. :) 
---
I am all for it.
---
Clear your list, most of them goldsellers are banned in a few months.
---
I recently got Aurora and hate the effects so much... I thought it wouldn't have an aura but only the glowing balls while in combat. I've tried to counter the purple aura with a white glow from the Requiem Set but it just looks like a hot mess. 
---
it's because those legendaries are UNIQUE. they are actually special, one of the kind. pharus (and the claw) on the other hand, is BLAND. nothing legendary about it. the argument is not over whether it's ugly or not (subjective taste), but rather, is it legendary or not (it does not stand out - here is where people like to think it has to shoot rainbows out of its arse to stand out but no, a simple choya on a stick is a stand out.). 
---
This is everything I didn't know I wanted.
---
that terpander will be much better as a gw2 gen 2 leggy than this pharus. 
---
It just One of LED light need replace just send ticket to support.
---
Awesome ! How long does it take to paint something like that?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also did you learn in school or at home?
---
Check your graphics card for updated drivers maybe? 
---
Am I doing it right? (üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è)
---
I am the globglogabalab.
---
my main concern is to made zodiac and the character skin look similar, to not use a polyluminescent infusion will make it easier to color the rest of the armor, but even if, for example, I'll be able to create the illusion than the character skin and the zodiac torso have the same pattern, it'll be ok, even if green, yellow or red \^\^ (I'm trying to avoid the poliluminescent black, don't like my armors to be too dark)
---
my objective is to make character skin and zodiac pattern to be similar, have not to rely on poliluminsecent infusion will be better, but I can make it work even if it isn't blue \^\^
---
Ty
---
Holo.
---
AMAZING :)
---
can't wait to use it :)
---
"I can't decide if you two are terrifying or inspiring..." 'Nuff said :D
---
Oh! I have this bug aswell! I tried using some scripts to play some songs a week ago, but the songs came out like a garbled mess!
---
I assumed it was lag but maybe this is the problem D:
---
I love the bow! Totally!
---
holy shit
---
Yean I wonder the samething about Warmaster efut. I have not seen her since the PS epilogue.
---
It's still a MASSIVE project. I refuse to go with the "it's a waste of time" crowd, but this isn't as trivial as flipping a switch.
---
WvW legendary chest.
---
There's no Symbol for Space bar.
---
Chrono. Shield is necessary for tides of time (skill 5) which provides alacrity and CC.
---
Putting more effort into the game than Anet Devs do, congratulations.
---
That's the thing about GW2, you have to pick your goals for yourself. I for example love doing collections and AP hunting, so when I log on I work on getting recipes for various armor sets (for example Bountyhunter or Warbeast) or check [gw2ap](https://gw2ap.com/) which of my achievements is almost finished and do this then.
---
So pick a goal for yourself and pursue until then -&gt; rinse repeat.
---
I knew someone would notice that, it's not about the fact it's 3gold it's the fact you need 500 hours to know about it.
---
Failing to*
---
This is awesome beyond words. That speedometer?! What in the world. Can you help explain how you did that? (I am technically challenged)
---
We will watch your HUD with great interest, young Blish.
---
Funny thing is, the skills are not split like some skills are in PvP.
---
I tried this earlier and could literally oneshot someone with skill that barely tickles someone in real sPvP (or some wvw situations).
---
So not that intresting unless you wanna see how would it play out if you had pve power and pve power creep.
---
In pugs nobody is going to care what build you bring as long as it gets results. If your off-meta weapon combination is getting more DPS than other DPS players, nobody will say a thing. 
---
And if you're really worried about being kicked, make your own LFG - 'all welcome/chill run/no flaming' for example. It also depends on the content you play; nobody is going to bother kicking for dungeons given how faceroll they are. T3/4 Fractals are fine as well if you can justify your usage of them. Raids are the only place I would not recommend an off-meta build when pugging, and even then you can just solve it by making your own LFG.
---
imo too using this for practice for pvp wouldnt be logical at all like youre saying: my friend suggested its maybe a good way for testing pve builds against each other or literally just for fun/for those who wanna end some fights with duels lol. 
---
Pistil/shield kitless holosmith 
---
Omg that speedometer!
---
Anet doesn't support streaming particularly well.
---
Repair your client.
---
add -repair to the target line in the GW2 shortcut. It's not your graphics card, don't worry.
---
It must be getting more difficult to balance black lion skins vs. legendary skins. Yikes.
---
Well this is definitely the most impressive thing I've seen all year
---
If you play both ele and engi, then it's pretty natural to have kits and attunements be the same set of keys, but by default they're reversed from one class to the other.
---
&gt; switched over to the English voices to train my English pronounciation in reallife
---
I very much relate to that: I could see a lot of improvements in my reading and earing understanding after a few weeks of playing in English. Plus, player chatter can grow real annoying real quick when spoken in a language you fully understand; its been years, and I can still quote what my Elemenalist said when switching to Air (J'INVOQUE LE POUVOIR DE LA TEMPETE).
---
On a unrealted question, does anyone know why Glints name was changed to Brill in French ? My best guess is that they wanted to keep the 'pun' (glint -&gt; glisten(?) / brill -&gt; briller, to shine in french) but its weird to change a character's name
---
Generally not the people playing video games on a PC though, so it doesn't say much.
---
What chest piece is your ele wearing?
---
Yeah, really. At first I was like "this is pretty nice" but then I saw the speedometer and knew this was some quality work.
---
&gt;Sends two pictures of half-empty instances
---
&gt;It looks like the population in the game has declined.
---
Please tell me you were joking and forgot /s lol
---
But sure, population is gone, better uninstall now before anet hijacks your pc and does not allow you uninstall anymore.
---
Oofyikes. Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge.
---
I agree that the VLC cones need a little more work. Maybe they'll get it before release.
---
How exactly do you do this? 
---
I would love some more stuff like the newest legendary scepter (forgot it's name) with the little dragon/wyrm flying around. Or some more tribal or mechanic inspired legendaries.
---
Party up, head to jahai &gt; suns refuge, then the spot is towards the south. Enter the arena and u can damage each other and use finishers etc
---
Are you using the program that someone created for GW2MB or the scripts / Autohotkey alone? 
---
I found the program was broken for me and just repeated the same note over and over so I switched to the scripts alone, everything sounds way better
---
*Aura Wardrobe* has long been a requested feature. It should both unlock skins like Aurora for account-wide use, and let people convert tradeable aura infusions into account-bound unlocks.
---
As for Aurora itself... I also hope that when Aura Wardrobe happens, I can actually split the moon effect from the glow effect. I don't think one works well with the other, and I have characters that could use both separately but not together.
---
Many instances of busy zones means you can never tell the specific population from a single screen shot. I mean, sometimes there are multiple zones, some are busier than others. A data set of 2 is ridiculous. I was in a mistlock that was packed earlier today.
---
Something dark/shadow themed. With smoky shadowsteps
---
anet probably plays their game muted, like most people do
---
In every game the interesting part of the game to stream is pvp. And gw2 pvp community is like 2% of the community
---
And what's the infusion combo?   
---
Cuz I'm assuming Ice Encasement outfit and chaos staff
---
Very nice work! :)
---
Aren't they already tagged [Art]? We don't need a new tag.
---
Blue fire sword dropped from various loot bags, all can be found on the gw2 wiki. It is sold in the trading post for 2 gold and 70+ silver, which is how I got it when I was just starting out.
---
This looks superb! I'm going to keep an eye out on this.
---
do you know how filters and tags work?  
---
if they create an [artwork] tag, users who don't want to see artworks can simply filter them out.  
---
that won't affect anyone else, but the user will have a better browsing experience.
---
Out of the blue comes a competitor to Taco, it's hard to believe it!
---
Can you share anything about the code, in what is this written and which frameworks it's using to render the overlay? It is something custom like taco or an existing framework? Any performance issues?
---
Or the home instances! For all those without PoF.
---
That just goes back to the community thing I said that keeps pulling me back to GW2. You just gotta find that guild that suits you and do content with them :) I've recently been dragging my WvW guildies through low lv fractals, if they tried to do it with randoms it would be a much worse experience for them :/ Its a shame, but that is just the way every "public" gaming community is :(
---
I m not sure u can fully hyde chat behind this on nah? Or u hide 25% of the screen
---
Scourge arms, wvw chest, lion head. shining blade and defender of argon. Aurora and confetti infusion
---
Literally Unplayable 
---
We must be browsing two separate subreddits then, because I'm here every single day without fail, and when I click the "new" option I never get the impression you describe.
---
Thanks, it is usefull. Didn't know EBG is a reccomended for objectives until I entered it. I was always looking for map where is the most people, silly me :)
---
That's how mafia works.
---
&gt;but there's nothing you can say to convince me that player created art is relevant to the game, because it's not
---
Fan art of a video game is not relevant to the video game. Ooooooookay.
---
also get 3 more from guild trader per day too.
---
You abound be able to change the size of your chat to make it smaller :)
---
Winters heart infusion stacked like crazy
---
I think that's what it was, I just kept going to new map instance
---
Sure but if i were u i would put something on the right of the character
---
Yea, I actually realized I was doing dailies with PvP when I was lvling up to accelerate the process with tomes. Don't know why I decided stop doing that when i hit 80 lol
---
I‚Äôll have to look into that :) thank you :) 
---
Infinite Light
---
I like your style
---
Dude, the german male asura voiced by Patrick Bach is the best character in the game. The English versions are all bad of course. 
---
Now I need to listen to the French male asura.
---
Why do you want to look so dumb? 
---
That's just what you get for using a harpy sword :P
---
That Movie was INCREDIBLE. It filled in so many gaps of things I totally didn't understand.
---
I'd love some necrotic green like Marjory's weapon skins. I feel like we could also use some yellow.
---
I also wouldn't mind some more lore-relevant weapons that tie into the playable races such as how we got the Shining Blade and the Claw of the Khan-Ur.
---
And just as a personally imagined weapon, before we got Xiuquatl, I was thinking of a paintbrush themed scepter with colored projectiles and footfalls. Think vibrant colors such as you'd see in Splatoon and where each splotch of paint was a different color.
---
For a couple of spitball ideas: a food-themed legendary or a shattered glass legendary. I'm sure there's plenty of untapped ideas out there.
---
It's called Binding of Ipos
---
Xiuquatl and Ipos are fantastic and I'm glad to have them both. I just wish Xiuquatl could be used while mounted but unfortunately a dev confirmed that isn't possible
---
^ id say this is false
---
for the sole purpose of having people ask the question I asked :3
---
It doesn't seem so, Winter's heart doesn't work this way
---
If anything there is currently a influx of players thanks to WoW's troubling times it appears to be having with it's players base atm...
---
Everyday I read more and more people come back over or giving it a fresh try all together.
---
What infusion do you think it is then? This looks insane though 
---
He has the winters essence infusion on, that‚Äôs the 1st one 
---
Just let us customize the UI ffs ANet
---
def interested in this.  I'll be downloading it once v1 is released 
---
This might be it. But then you see there's armor affected, afaik the infusion doesn't affect gear
---
Hi; I‚Äôm just returning to the game after a long while, I know chrono got hit pretty hard a few weeks ago, but is it still utilised in raids? Snowcrows still says its meta on every boss unless they haven‚Äôt updated?? 
---
Cheers man,will definitely try binding skills to mouse buttons!
---
But why is this cool to you?
---
I think the French version is better then Patrick Bach :P Like I said, it's pretty subjective.
---
Yeah, but I don't have a problem with loot boxes as long as their contents aren't PtW or the only way to access content. Convenience and cosmetics I am okay with.
---
They say nature is cruel, and so is her mother.
---
Hook uses a build based on reshade code with their own interface and such. While reshade is more basic but with the same functions. 
---
It's kind of like adding more things to reshade to make the user experience easier. Those things added take up extra CPU power if that makes sense. 
---
Hm, yes it can and you can use various methods to do so although, some features may shut off when you move to prevent cheating. Just gotta find the right ones (: 
---
I disagree with your point about elite specs. They change up professions a lot more than a new weapon type does, and they're far from out of weapons to add. Future elite specs could even change the way you use weapons already available to the profession, for example making Mesmer greatsword melee instead of ranged with completely different skills when a particular elite spec is equipped.
---
Ah okay, but that also means i can reuse my reshade/settings-file i created with hook i guess?
---
I'll definitely try it, looking forward to release :)
---
As long as they use the same .fx versions you should be able to load up the .ini's but I could be wrong and it might now work depending on the various builds that hook has complied from reshade 
---
True, there's way worse out there. 
---
Isn't the entire lower ground of the jungle (pulsating vines) considered part of Mordemoth? If you consider that then he'll be the biggest dragon yet, maybe even bigger than Kralk is now.
---
In what way is that funny?
---
Ouch, that birth would hurt.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
You don't need to see the boons and conditions. You can know how fast or slow you are going by how long your skills are taking to activate. 
---
Unless you have some insane lag over 1000ms.
---
Tbh Id rather to see hide animation on aurora like you can do on helmet/shoulders/gloves. I personaly dont like effects, I mean glow is cool but balls in my opinion arent that great.  If they add that feature it would be great that shouldnt be that much work I guess. We have it on backpack aswell. 
---
A yellow snowman. What a poor, unfortunate soul. 
---
Looks amazing. I was only talking today with my friend about how it's a shame taco development basically ceased as there were a few ideas I'd love to see. Plus I was telling them about the old pocketknife app which yours reminds me of but yours is much much better.
---
  
---
Mainly this feature though as it really urks me in taco.
---
\* Custom hot keys - so you can set the hide markers ability to multiple hot keys so when you open the map, or any ui with a shortcut, it hides the overlay so you don't see it on top of stuff in game like menus etc.
---
Other one was
---
\* World boss timer notification - your timers look great, really like them. Do you have a popup reminder of sorts for it? There was this over wolf application way back that used the art from the loading screens in a small rectangle popup which you clicked for the waypoint.
---
Will you be including the wvw overlay taco has too?
---
You've done so well. I can't wait to try it. Hopefully you can get an anet Dev to sign off on it too like they did Taco. :3
---
In addition to what the other guy said, the recipe for upgrading from cores is significantly cheaper which reduces the demand for lodestones. 
---
This is awesome. I will be keeping an eye on you :)  
---
Landmark search looks amazing. One selfish idea that immediately popped into my mind - you said you can click to copy code to clipboard? Would it be difficult to make something like right-click immediately post to chat? Haha that would be great as I play with a steam controller and don't have a keyboard.
---
Holy crap i would love to alpha /beta test it :O 
---
Interestingly enough spears were actually in the coding to be used on land originally.
---
It would also be a good fit for warrior &amp; guardian and possibly ranger.
---
I doubt that we will see a 3rd set with the next LS season, we know we will get a Light themed longbow next, and only the iconic greatsword is left now.. My guess for the greatsword would either be something really dark and evil, necro green, or something like the Shining Blade that is very tied to the story.. (like a krallartorrik crystal greatsword for example)
---
No. It's a poorly written article by somebody who doesn't understand what he's talking about. 
---
As far as we know (and as far as devs said) UI code is such a gordian knot even this magician wouldn't help it much...
---
in the US its still one in eight people that lives below the poverty line.
---
This looks awesome i can't wait to use it!
---
&gt; Generally not the people playing video games on a PC though
---
Yes, they do, but very rarely. I've gotten a couple in the last few months from farming Istan.
---
One thing I'd like to request is that we can either add our own or search in a database for things like farming spots or where to find certain things.  
---
Let's say I search for some kind of wood; it'd tell me what maps has that kind of wood, along with known farming spots for that kind of wood.  
---
If you don‚Äôt need PoF stats, I advise doing the story of ls3 ep1 just enough to unlock the reward track and that will allow you to get a backpack that you can reset the stats on cheaply. All of the ls3 episodes are good for various trinkets (you‚Äôd have to do a couple to complete a whole set due to unique status). This method is just a small amount of pve then just reward track farming. 
---
There‚Äôs also the ability to get an exo backpack from the first part of PoF story and upgrade that with a collection. 
---
You could simply throw gold at it and craft an ascended backpiece. 
---
Brilliant! Why not a whole black lion set like that? Had not thought of fireworks!
---
Justifying game balance to players is literally never fruitful. As she said, it's the constant back and forth discussion that takes ages and ultimately never results in the player going "oh, OK cool". They always end up unhappy that their class got nerfed (even if it's deserved; see: chrono). 
---
There's no trick or conspiracy. It's just RNG.
---
Exclusive full screen support or nay? The most important question for me is the performance hit and exclusive full screen support like arc. 
---
But since you said it's like taco my hopes are low.
---
I really really think that if you don't equip weapons on any class, you should have 4 fist skills and a new combo field. 
---
Jab - punch your foe rapidly (auto attack).
---
Type: punch
---
Uppercut - charge a punch that will do more damage, cast time 0.5, cooldown 4, combo finisher: K.O.
---
Knock down - charge a punch that will knock down your foe, knockdown 1, cast time 1, cooldown 10, heavy damage, combo field: Ring Match.
---
Block - channel glint to grant you powers to block incoming punches. Gain 5s of fury when successfully blocking and enemy Uppercut. (Holds fists up to protect / block animation) 
---
Combo field: Ring Match (2s) - use a K.O finisher in this field to gain 5 stacks of might for 10 seconds while unarmed (animation of small transparent boxing ring and landing the blast in it rings the boxing bell üîî to confirm the combo). 
---
GW2s QoL is absolutely unparalleled. It's the reason GW2 veterans can't get into other games, even if they're new and shiny. A lot of us take these features for granted, but they're largely unique in the genre.

Hello there :) How do i get Assasins accesories ? :) I need them according to Mesmer Power build but 2 earrings used there are both for about 10k Arah dungeon tokens. Thats really not something i want to go through :D Is there better way to get ASsasins earrings and rings ? :) Thank you

By taking shield instead of pistol, you lose about 1-2% dps (i.e. close to nothing).

Oh god the comments below that "article"

new arenanet game is going to be mobile so you better hope gw2 survives long enough for you to lose interest

"Just do it right" isn't as helpful a suggestion as you think it is

---
A filter wouldn't be so bad, honestly.
---
Because certain combos feel better. When I play pdps soulbeast I have elite + sic em and vulture on alt 5,4,3 so I can press them easily in a row. On shatter mirage having jaunt on alt 5 while pressing f keys is a no go
---
Cool! This sounds like something I'd be interested in joining, though I'm not exactly new to raiding... what I do have that is new is a barrier Scourge, and I've really been itching to use it in raids, but my static group is long gone, and I'm not very optimistic about pugging with a non-dps class.
---
I would love to bring that along to provide support for some training runs! Ideally it should make for smoother runs than just one healer. Of course, I wouldn't want to take away a slot from one of the people this event was meant for, but, if you think it's something that could be worked in, let me know. I can contact you in-game closer to the event time.
---
Either way, it's great to see people organize so much around making raids more accessible! Keep up the good work.
---
Not one of them has a trenchcoat. wtf
---
I agree that the French voice actor is pretty good. 
---
Man, for the life of me I dont get why people want these types of things, or even believe they'll happen. MMORPG's are designed to be modular; they have an extremely high initial money and time investment in development, but they're made to be built onto for long-term gain for companies willing to invest their time in that (which a lot are opting not to and move onto cheaper game development to increase profit margins (*Activision-Blizzard, I'm looking at you*)). 
---
Do you see how much of the map is still left to be discovered? We havent even been to Cantha yet. Look at a map of Tyria (world), and see that we dont even have the full picture in game, not even close. The only reason a sequel would be necessary is to completely revamp how the game is at its core (e.g. moving from a linear, instance-based mission progression game (Guild Wars 1) to an open-world MMORPG (Guild Wars 2)). What do they want, a Guild Wars first-person shooter?
---
Why do you even read this website?

Many trinkets with selectable stats offer assassins-stats (e.g. ls3 maps, raid, fractal) - you can find a list of trinkets here [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended\_trinket#Rings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket#Rings)

I was in a speed running guild during the transition from gw1 to gw2 so they would advertise in guild chat a lot or message people directly.

As for lore relevant, we also got Caladbolg. Both the regrown and the original version. As well as regrown Caladbolg sword, shield, scepter, and dagger. I personally love the little butterflies flying around, and having one of Ventari‚Äôs teachings written in the item when you click it
---
I think the biggest problem they face with it is that GW2's "faction" system does not seem to support having an entity which is an enemy to one player and totally non-interactable to others. Every entity is either an enemy which can be attacked, or is fully invulnerable (to all), or an ally which can be buffed. So outside interference can only be mitigated by physical separation. That's my reckoning of it anyway.

We're all commanders though???
---
That's a bit tough since you need boon duration. I think your only real option is givers, though you wouldn't be able to raid with it since you would have too much toughness. You could maybe try wanderer from Dragons Stand for some budget pieces with no toughness. Of course harriers is meta so you could craft warbeast or something but at that point you may as well just make ascended armor. If you don't want boon duration and just want to be a healer, magi may be an option, or clerics (has toughness).
---
Not sure what you are referring to :o
---
Gotcha, I will simply learn it by doing then :D
---
Yeah I thought about that too but as you can see,he doesn't have the character targeted or moused over :O
---
Calm your tits. You can whine about sample size all you want. The mount skins are actually under 'uncommon' and not 'rare'. You can preview a chest you know. Alltho its unrealistic to keep up a 5/6 chance, its still an indication the drop rate isnt that abysmal. Criticism on what. Im not portraying this as a droprate study am i. 
---
You can probably sort the TP by price to figure out what items haven't been available in years.
---
Off the top of my head a few I know are limited are a hat and shirt with the GW2 logo on it, and I think some of the town clothes tonics haven't been available since they were made into tonics.
---
Sounds like there are some exclusives, but not many. Thanks 
---
I was told One Wolf Pack plays a significant role in this.
---
Bell, vial and spear are horrible ideas. So much cringe
---
When it is finished, where can we download this awesome add on
---
GW2 is a game that desperately needs "spring cleaning" update. I am not even talking about adding QoL things like build templates, aura wardrobe, separate keybinds for characters or dozen other people ask weekly on this sub. I am talking about things that are most puzzling for new players like for example that some items are sellable, some are account bound, some are soulbound and you cannot make any logical rule for this (some exotic are soulbound, other aren't, but all ascended are less restrictive using only account bound, and don't get me started on "some of stat combinations are not tradeable, mostly expansion ones but with exceptions..." and things that get bound on use). All those small things cause "WTF" in new players, making game feel unpolished, unfinished. Like for example exploring core maps may make you hit invisible wall, but if you explore HoT map, map edges simply kill you without visual cause and with too late of a warning. Or that 90% of recipes are gained through discovery, but somehow most useful ones are gained through some obscure merchant from hard to farm map. Or that HoT maps can be reached on foot/mount from core Tyria, but PoF maps are reachable only through starting PoF story.
---
Small, everyday inconveniences take new player focus off the great things in this game and make veterans more irritated and eager to complain. 
---
Considering I spent 60 dollars where it's free now and you can upgrade your account by just buying the cheaper expansions it isnt a absurd question and worth asking. Thanks for you input have a great day 
---
you wouldn't say this if the article happened to be positive about gw2 and anet :)
---
Me to!!! Send me download link if we can test!!
---
I actually think I might have HoT I'm pretty sure I played for a while when that came out 
---
I think new weapontypes are quite plausible, especially since weapon-rich  professions such as warrior are kind of "running out of weapons" (Remaining are: trident, staff, scepter, focus, shortbow, pistol, pistol (off) or something like spear on land‚Ä¶ not nothing but not too many especially considering most of them are usually used by spell-related professions).
---
However I do think they would come for elitespecs not for core professions.
---
You'll keep both Sunrise and Twilight Skins if you equip them, then convert them into Eternity and then sell, however you will not have Eternity Skin.
---
&gt; Can't be f2p if you farm in Istan.
---
Ah, so just farming in Istan is boring but not when done in core maps?
---
&gt; Would mean saving up for at least over a month just to buy the game if you spent no money at all, and saving for at least ~120 days to buy that $300 laptop.
---
I mentioned the fact that half the population is living off less than 2.5$ per day because farming the equivalent of 2$ in game was trivialized and called boring. The poverty line in the US is around 12k US$ per year.
---
&gt; Which is not the demographic you initially mentioned at all.
---
Exactly. Because you mentioned that those that actually fall into that demographic dont play guild wars, so I gave you the US demographic below the poverty line, which is one of Anets main customer markets,
---
&gt; but it's actually something I'd rather not have happen
---
you don't want it to be like the other legendary weapon and armor skins, correct? if so, i got it perfectly.  
---
and i'm saying that it should be concistent with how every other legendary weapon and armor piece works.
---
Thats why I said "Very possible in a reasonable time for people who farm a lot".
---
The problem with whips is double: First, the physics, and second, they don't really fit too many professions. However, they are perfect for weapon and slot skills, and there's already a few like that. A whip or chain weapon kit would also work wonders, specially for the thief. Since it would be a kit, it would have one model only, letting it have custom animations.
---
One-handed whips could also be sword skins (we already got a [chain-whip sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chain-Whip_Sword_Skin)), and SAB already introduced [some flails](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Super_Mace_(skin\)) as mace skins (there should be more though).

Real fashion is knowing how to make low level gear stand out.

You paid 60$ over 6 years ago; which qualifies as game time.

---
Is it possible with the current API to implement customizable markers or trails on other people to track them. The main use of it would be for WVW commander tag visibility and making it easier to follow them.
---
Nobody got the xpac for free. Yes, ppl were upset (which is idiotic btw), but that died down.
---
I'm very much in the same boat with you. What I've done is turn basic character models on and just try to make my own character the way I like it. Having everything else look bland and yourself look amazing adds to the appeal imo.

Jesus Christ people are toxic as hell about this, I just asked a question since I havent been following in like 2 years and get downvoted to all hell for a question. Thanks for a warm welcome back to the community guys really nice thanks!
---
You didn't get HoT for free.
---
The refund was if you had bought core GW2 + preordered HoT between the time of the HoT announcement and the F2P announcement. You only got the core game refunded.
---
If you had bought core GW2 before the HoT announcement and preordered HoT then you got an extra character slot for free.
---
If you only bought core GW2 after the HoT announcement but didn't want to play at all then they'd refund you the core game and close your account.
---
I think the game's worth the extra cash man, and they all still one time payments
---
Are tonics and chairs equip-able gear?

I strongly support your idea to merge underwater weapon skins with their above-ground counterpart. This would also help pave the way for playable above-ground spears, tridents, and harpoon guns (crossbows).

I also never understand why detailed and interesting posts like this one are downvoted. Even if people disagree with some of the points, the upvote/downvote system is meant to assess quality, and to filter out incorrect or low-effort posts.

---
That's not an excuse for breaking the rules. 
---
Follow the rules and everything is okay. It's not that hard.
---
The main reason to add it to a major city is to remove the annoyance of having to load a new instance or zone. Here is like all public and you are doing your own business like usual, bank, crafting and in the meantime you can check out the people dueling nearby. It shouldn't be FAR from where people stand. I'd say the center of the plaza while there's no festivals is great.

Depends on the group in my experience so far. I've seen the chronotank + hybrid fb + rev comp pull off pre-nerf uptimes, while I've seen a lot of strugglebus on the double chrono front since the nerf.

---
Calling me my behavior shitty and toxic while im only speaking my mind.
---
Its literally what veteran players told me.To never hang out on raids cause its toxic fest.Just try to join any party to raid and i can say for sure you will get kicked if you wont preper yourself ealier.Imagine waiting for a trening lobby while there are non and you are unable to join any other cause you will get kicked for sure.

Yeah either what the character is facing or in the direction of the nearest targeted enemy! that'd be great :)

---
&gt;Questions **outside of the question tread** being downvoted instantly is pretty much a given in this sub, it's not only you.
---
**Question the First**
---
If I wanted to measure my boon uptime before I wander into raids with a chronomancer, what would be the best way to do it? 
---
Does ArcDPS measure boon uptime? Does it do reports for the Special Forces golem? 
---
I can get a good 16-18 seconds or so of alacrity and quickness on myself (from the mouseover) with fairly random gear (berserker, wanderer, commander and harrier and maybe a few bits of assassin... who even knows?), but how it affects me and how it affects others are two different things because I generate it for myself very easily (in order to get Time Warp, ToT and SoI up sooner). I might ask a guildie to just sort of stand there so I can boon all over his face if the report is useable. 
---
I play power chrono now and diviner gear looks delicious. I'll be converting my armour as soon as the insignia recipe becomes available to me, then there's the arduous task of getting my accessories. 
---
**Question the Second**
---
Can I have some build advice? Sort of for raids.
---
I never played boonshare chrono before so I'm coming into it bright eyed and bushy tailed. I figure a DPS/Support chrono's role is to get as much alacrity and quickness uptime as possible and then stabbity-stab-stab DPS in the downtime. 
---
The logic is more alacrity on me means I can give it back out more often. With that in mind,
---
Chaos 1-1-2: More boon duration. Random boons from lesser chaos storm. Will use shatters a lot to maximise own alacrity so Bountiful Dissillusionment makes the most sense as it makes use of that to raise my own DPS. 
---
Illusions 2-2-2 entirely for the last two traits with shatters recharging faster and doing more stuff: more shatter = more alacrity on me = more alacrity and quickness on everyone else. 
---
Chronomancer: 3-3-2 wells do healing because why not, mathematically stronger alacrity on self (I think?) so more on other people, and then sieze the moment to give myself more quickness for DPS reasons and fitting as much as possible in the continuum shift window. 
---
I'm thinking sword/shield and sword/sword (or focus?) with healing well, SoI, alacrity well, quickness well and Time Warp. I'm aware this loses CC but it adds considerable amounts of quickness.
---
Anyway... this is complete theorycrafting at the moment. Any opinions?
---
Once again you are wrong i did not post a match up it was not me
---
I've always called him my favorite pinata charr! &lt;3
---
&gt;I've seen the chronotank + hybrid fb + rev comp pull off pre-nerf uptimes
---
nonsense, you could not keep 11 boons up.  you're also now down 1 extra dps class, it's strictly worse.
---
&gt; while I've seen a lot of strugglebus on the double chrono front since the nerf.
---
The boon uptime may drop during some split phases, but if it drops elsewhere the chronos are just not doing their rotations correctly, which could just as well be the case on fb or rev.
---
Because they were posted from a mobile phone.
---
People are just being fucking stupid. WoW has a lot of flaws and is old but there's no WoW 2. If the game is still alive and kicking ass, why kill it?
---
I wouldn't say this if the article didn't show that the writer is clueless.
---
Yeah, I saw that too. Maybe posting it on Tyria squad, parties or even world bosses would make more sense.
---
For your second question, do you know about snowcrows? https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/
---
It is the go-to resource for raiding. 
---
I think your build ideas are a bit out of date, though it is possible things will change in the upcoming patch with a new set of gear being introduced. With two chronos, you don't need all that much boon duration in raids to maintain permanent boons (due to SoI). A lot of your ideas are sound in theory, but the actual math is such that you don't need all of that  Stuff like seize the moment is unnecessary, chronophantasma is just better because you don't need the extra self quickness. Healing Wells is niche and you could use it if your party needs the extra healing, but in general is unnecessary. The current meta build is inspiration/dueling for the 10 man SoI (like you thought) and dueling for pure dps.
---
Then give this game another decade before expecting a threequel. It ain't happening anytime soon.

It's hilarious because this subreddit will downvote anything that rustles their jimmies even if it's a good discussion material, but - yes, it's time for Guild Wars 3. My guess is that it's going to be announced around Q4 2019 after LS5 is done. It may not even be a "true MMO", or it may be a mobile title given current market trends. The stacking of two LS seasons on top of PoF being meh content-wise *makes me really suspicious*. And on top of that, there's people speculating about GW3 already, which also doesn't help the brand.

---
I do it because my mouse only has 2 side buttons.  So basically, those buttons are always dedicated to what the class I'm playing needs for their rotation. For instance, on Chrono it's my F4 and F5 so I have quick and easy access to Split and distort. On Weaver it's my air and fire attunements.  On dps scourge it's to drop the sand shade and activate the F5, but heal scourge it's the shade and barrier (f3?). On guard and firebrand it's f1 and f2. 
---
Then whatever the leftover class abilities there are get assigned the f1-3 based on how important they are to my rotation. So like with Condi Weaver, my f1 is earth, and water is f2. 
---
It sounds weird, but changing the keybinds specifically for each class has actually been a make or break on enjoying certain builds and rotations. I hated all of the Weaver builds until I figured out the most comfortable keybinds specifically for it. 
---
If it makes u feel better dual is also a word.
---
Are you implying there is some sort of conspiracy?
---
Only if you can enable or disable it with a toggle. It always used to bug me in WoW when I‚Äôd be minding my own business when some rando asshat would start spamming duel requests. Doubly so if they were at least 10 levels higher than me.

---
WTB Spanish VAs for Guild Wars 2... (q,q)
---
There are no other classes with no cooldowns. Maybe revenant would be the closest with the energy mechanic as utility abilities have short CDs or no cds, but weapon skills have CDs. It is also fairly fast paced when playing renegade. 
---
I think ele does fit your requirements actually. You just need to learn which skills are strong. Stuff like sword Weaver is very fast paced but flows very nicely. 
---
Actually, are you looking for something for pvp or pve or what? The answer might change depending on what you want. 
---
Yes, railings would be great and the torches were the closest I could find (and not very visually intrusive) - they actually stop you ;)
---
Thanks!
---
There isn't a link just yet, but I will post an update for everyone once there is!  I'm hoping to have a first iteration available for everyone to play around with in about a week or so.
---
thanks for the clarifications! 
---
I thought it functioned similar to taco (from what your screenshots/gifs suggested) I just thought it would be important to clarify that to prevent people assuming it's an exploit and report it :)
---
By tolerated you mean? Like what would an error like that have as an counter action? Do you want to ride them over with a tank? 
---
Have you tried noting them about wrong listing, before coming here with shitpost?
---
I am considering between Mesmer and Ranger right now in regards to open world and daily fractals...
---
Do you think Chrono is better for open world / supporting in fractals or the Ranger?
---
Yeah I'd personally like to have that nice fog-like purple aura without the orbs.  I also think the orbs would look better if they trailed after the player instead of moving around in a set pattern above our backs, like maybe they slowly rotate around us when we're idle and when we move they also move at about the same pace as the aura does.

---
In reality though, in the 500 hour example, everything on that toon can be obtained very cheaply and within an hour of hitting max level. Cobalt is super cheap, gem store scarf, etc.
---
Yeah, I thought it was lag too but no. The problem came when putting them in your novelty. Something is messing up the notes, the scripts are fine.
---
That article was shite as was most of the comments.  
---

Of course, but the fractal stuff is nearly impossible to find groups for nowadays, the PvP one can only be progressed during certain times, and the wvw one is just very slow (trying that one now)

Ah yes, because it's normal to have a rule whose main purpose is to clean up the official forum from *honest trailers voice* NEGATIVE BRAND PERCEPTION.
---
Thank you! :)
---
&gt; And yes that's exactly the point. Chronos are not doing rotations correctly.
---
Yeah but a quickness fb and an alacrity rev will do their rotations correctly?
---
&gt; The hybrid fb and rev means you also run condi druid, so realistically you're about where you were before minus the extra couple of boons.

hrm I still doubt that gets you to double chrono comp but that does sound a bit better.

I've been getting those as well lately. Crashes even state that arc is causing them. I always used the latest version.
---
while I understand that you're emotional about this; and I get that it's frustrating to see your home server reduced to ashes... the problem here is people leaving; I've moved servers for WvW; because I was not enjoying the fights I was getting on the server I was on; 
---
in a situation like this, there are two solutions: 
---
1. convince a few large guilds to move to your server; 
---
2. move your guild to another server. 
---
my guild did the math and it was more cost effective for us to move elsewhere (to a fuller server) than for us to try and get guilds to join us, moving our 100 people was cheaper than negotiations with other WvW servers/guilds to convince their guilds to move to us.
---
__The alliance system ^(coming soon^TM)*should* improve this__, as your server size will no longer lock you in a team; instead your alliance will be tied to other alliances to balance the match-ups. so linking can be a lot more fluid (alliances of varied sizes can combine into far more balanced teams than the current server sizes + linking...)
---
The goal is to make it open-source, yes!  :) 
---
It's written in C#, so once v1 is released, anyone is more than welcome to use an application like dotPeek to rummage through the source if I haven't released the source by then. 
---
And yes, I do plan on opening the API up to allow for other modules to be loaded in.  It's currently designed specifically to allow for this.  You can see some details about it here: [https://trello.com/c/iD3An5BP/21-external-module-support](https://trello.com/c/iD3An5BP/21-external-module-support)
---
I have to think some implementation details through just to help prevent bad apples from spoiling the bunch, but ultimately, I think it's one of the most exciting aspects of Blish HUD.  Like /u/Kulinda mentioned, there is the opportunity of a ton of great community content if the barrier of entry is lowered a bit.  :)
---
Does the sPvP season end at reset on Monday or some other time?
---
I mostly play PvE casually, but I want to do whatever seems fun at the moment. I dont't care all that much about what's meta here or there.
---
Do you think it would be a good idea to boost the Ele to 80? I'd mostly play low-level content anyway until I learn the class, so would having the full core toolset available make it more fun? Or is it a better idea to learn as you level?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXp8Th41rBs
---
I don't think a new player can understand or appreciate the difference between tiers etc. It will just all look chaotic to them. 
---
Shut up and pay up to transfer, filthy WvW scum! *cracks whip*
---
Search for Xyonon on youtube, he made chrono vids yesterday. He often posts his spreadsheets and theory crafts about mesmer and engi which are very well detailed. You won't find better build source for those classes.
---
Thanks. It might be quickness overkill. I'm definitely going to go for diviner's either way because of the self-buffing nature of chronomancer and was trying to find a build that made the most of that. 
---
The healing wells is there mostly because the other two look sort of marginal. I suppose the condition removal is useful too. In fractals, I use Well of Calamity and the elite one quite a lot so the healing off that is useful. I've only really raided as a druid so I assume that everyone needs healing all the time... 
---
I'm thinking ahead really with being as useful as possible without having to tank because I am really, really bad at it. I was also working on the assumption that the meta is in flux at the moment. 
---
I hope this post gets more traction because this seems like an actual issue D:
---
By the time they release their pet project the damage will be even harder to undo, so many people are already losing faith and interest.
---
Not until Gw2 stops making money. Same reason why there is no WoW 2.
---
Gw2 probably gets 2 or 3 more expansion before Gw3.
---
Which 'this' is this? Buying bound items, using lfg for it, or listing in the 'wrong' category?
---
It's fine, just skip them.
---
Were they tied to a festival?  I thought they were rare open world drops? 
---
Well, some do, when they release a "Gold" or "Complete" edition that includes everything for a highly discounted price. This usually happens when they release a new game in the franchise or years after release as a re-release. 
---
But I doubt it'll happen for GW2 anytime soon. 
---
We're not entirely done here, no. When's the last time you encountered a game that lets you have an option to unify or separate keybinds between characters?
---
What you want is not going to be as simple as having a dev bash their face against a keyboard for an hour. If this change is made, there won't be an option to complicate things and create a source of bugs.
---
So now, kindly answer my question instead of deflecting it. *Thank you.*
---
&gt; Future elite specs could even change the way you use weapons already available to the profession, for example making Mesmer greatsword melee instead of ranged with completely different skills when a particular elite spec is equipped.
---
This seems much more likely than new weapon types.
---
I disagree with the fractal one, I easily got groups by listing lfg, getting lucky with daily rec, begging in MS. Plenty of people willing to help. 
---
Liike they gonna do anything about it.
---
Which is also against TOS.
---
But how do you bot pvp? I mean genuinely asking. You just program your char to walk to point and die? I don't think making actual combat calculation is possible?
---
So you are not even speaking from personal experience, just what others told you? And based on that you are judging thousands of individual players? Based on hearsay?
---
You are a terrible person. I truly mean it.
---
I have different keybinds between scrapper and holosmith... It'd be amazing. 
---
That's a brilliant idea!  I'll mark that down in my notes.  That would look much better!
---
In the most simple way, yeah, that would work. If your program is more sophisticated, it becomes possible to make scripts telling the bot what to do depending on arbitrary conditions.
---
Then why have you not gotten the utility for RES that handles this and already exists?
---
I'm hoping that they either include a Tyria mastery or somewhat do a little change on how Elite Spec weapons work so they could be used without having that spec selected to spice up possible specs for classes  , stuff like Core Rifle Thief or Holosmith with Hammer.
---
The best thing for gs is the gs trait in beastmastery. I personally used beastmastery, marksmanship, and skirmishing until I swapped over to Soulbeast. I just replaced Skirmishing with Soulbeast.
---
It's written in C#.  :)
---
And you can't configure your skills to work with the keybinds? The classes are all so wildly different that this is impossible?
---
Really?
---
Maybe its because many raiders horde KPs from raidbosses and possibly also horde worldboss KPs in the same fashion? In my eyes this persons lfg:ing is more or less an attempt to reach an audience that has this "horde KPs" behaviour and hope some of them will want to part with it for a good enough price. I believe its mostly the decorator who looks for a guy with KPs rather than the other way around. Thats probebly why its posted in the raidlfg.
---
Exactly, it's a bundle. GW2 was base game, no extras.
---
&gt;The bot would have to play over 15 hours everyday just to achieve this playtime.
---
You're assuming there aren't people with that kind of free time and addiction to GW2?
---
Its a space between words like a sentence.
---
You got downvoted because of your responses to their answers. Also because it's not a new thing that we see a post like this, and we all know where they lead.
---
Basically all except thief and warr since they dont have strong/any healing builds. Some classes can also be removed if you play only pve or only wvw.
---
As soon as this is out its an instant download for me!
---
Epic comment dood
---
Thank you so much!  Yes, the speedometer was a cool module to work on.  I'm not sure which parts you have questions about, so here's the nitty gritty:
---
First I get your current velocity.  I use the GW2 Mumble API to get your current position and I compare it to your last position.  Then I put that over how long ago it was I recorded your last position.  This is the slope formula in action, really (y2 - y1 / x2 - x1).
---
Since your speed changes rapidly in game, it looks a little crazy to just display that value.  Here is what it looks like so far:
---
[https://gfycat.com/FearlessFalseJoey](https://gfycat.com/FearlessFalseJoey)
---
Now, to smooth things out, I store the last 10 velocities I recorded, and then I only display the average of the 10 values.  Now it looks much smoother:
---
[https://gfycat.com/SereneWeeButterfly](https://gfycat.com/SereneWeeButterfly)
---
Finally, to get the look of the bar filling up as you speed up, I made a little [partial circle graphic](https://imgur.com/6xaLcwe) and then I just rotate it a certain amount depending on how fast you're moving.  This looks like this, if I don't have the speedometer part on top of it:
---
[https://gfycat.com/AptDarkEagle](https://gfycat.com/AptDarkEagle)
---
Does that answer everything?  :)
---
Thank you for info!
---
I don't take games seriously. I don't want to play games professionally, or know too much how to play them, or play even averagely, so I try to keep everything as casual as possible by using simple-as-possible builds and rotations, and so far they have worked very nicely in raid/Fractal environment. I see no reason to know a profession other than knowing its rotation. I see no reason to improve DPS if it is good enough to beat the enrage timer in raids. There is no enrage timers in Fractals, so I can relax and casually follow simple rotation. I always play with pugs; sometimes it takes 2 or more hours to complete Fractals dailies, sometimes only 30 minutes.
---
What do you mean "don't ever do rifle autos", I always use autos whenever it is possible, in any profession and build. By the way, it is called autoattack because it autoattacks without pressing buttons. All my characters autoattack whenever it is possible.
---
Kitless Holo, DH, Deadeye, Daredevil and staff Weaver (with simplified rotation EarthFire-FireEarth-FireFire...) are the best DPS professions in game (what I have experienced) because they are so simple to play. Everything else requires too much thinking and timing (in rotation-wise).
---
Anyway, this is how I play, how do you play?
---
I can see why people might have that issue but I've never had a problem with it personally.
---
I still use it when I sometimes am forced to do some jumping puzzle where the room is complete darkness. Just pop open the wardrobe and transmute GS to cobalt for a few minutes and no fucks given.
---
I agree, it sucks even more when the weapons we do get are borderline useless. Looking at you, soulbeast dagger. (yes I know it can be used as quickness fodder because that's fun right?)
---
Do not buy from Amazon as they are not an authorized seller for game codes.  Game stop is listed as the official digital retailer and is also $15.  If you read the reviews on Amazon, some people got bad codes or had their accounts suspended for using the third party retailer. 
---
Oh, thanks. I didn't see that it had a time, I just thought it listed a date there.
---
See! My purpose the whole time, the light bearer.
---
Vials, bells, relics are all pretty close to Focuses.
---
Spears are already an aquatic weapon. 
---
Polearms - Seem viable as a land spear type.
---
Fists - Seems cool with the next expansion possibly being Cantha.  But I question how you'd do all the classes with Fist.  Fist Necromancer?  First Engineer?
---
&gt; What do you mean "don't ever do rifle autos", I always use autos whenever it is possible, in any profession and build. By the way, it is called autoattack because it autoattacks without pressing buttons. All my characters autoattack whenever it is possible.
---
You can disable your auto-attacks, you can also make any weapon skill your auto.
---
I work, have a lot of things to do in real life and still try to know about the things I play because that's how I effectively get the most out of my time.
---
Good luck.
---
I just want to say thank you, this looks awesome
---
Bell, Vial and Relic are such stretches its just embarrassing. I mean there is legitimate *want* for a land spear for years now. Fists would fit some classes and 2h spears are just a way to expand on land spears for martial classes. 
---
But everything else is just another renamed offhand Focus/Torch/Warhorn. 
---
Coming through my mind!
---
Just do what I do and use QERT and Z for Class Abilities, and 12345 for Weapon Abilities.
---
I use sword/axe as secondary for the burst that axe provides. Longbow is also good, I only use it for difficult fights.
---
Why respond at all if you're gonna call this look dumb rather then giving actual helpful feedback?  
---
Not everyone enjoys the same style. Something something to each his own.
---
Well, I *start* fight with sword 3 and then never use it again, but rifle 5 is part of rotation making my character much more vulnerable to boss attacks.
---
I don't want to do best DPS, only just enough to beat the enrage timer.
---
You didn't understand me. I didn't suggest a "right click, duel" option, because of your reason 3 actually. I suggested a small circle because that way only people that wants to enter is the ones that want duels. If Anet designate a small Dueling area in Lion's Arch, then point 2,3,4,5 are not a problem. As for 1, well, then maybe somewhere not that close to the center, maybe at the beach East of fractals.
---
This guy science
---
they need to start deleting servers. obviously the population is decreasing constantly so linking 3 servers together is just stupid at this point. wvw is dying, no need to hide it. Nothing is done to WvW to make it enjoyable. the rare updates we get are balance related (which has very little value as people play things that make sense, not things that have big numbers). nothing is done to trebuchets being built inside structures or to any skills that are made for pve. no redesign of any sort to anything...
---
Maybe they are working on GW3
---
Because I‚Äôm sick of seeing this crap on my screen. This is not even a character. This isn‚Äôt design. This isn‚Äôt interesting. It‚Äôs stupid and pointless. 
---
A lot of people have different design aesthetics but this is not an aesthetic. It‚Äôs visual noise. Mess. Ugly. Not creative. Trashy. 
---
Would you like me to go on? 
---
Same felling, no idea why the downvotes 
---
Oh, it makes senses now, thanks ! That involves alot of trust from the buyer tho. Is scam a common thing in that case ?
---
Happening to me a lot, what I‚Äôve been doing is like playing for a few months, take a break, and then playing for a few months, and then a break, and now recently i feel like getting back into the game again after a break playing RDR2
---
If ur on NA we can add friend and try together sometime xD,
---
You know how npcs run around in games, doing things, reacting to input a certain way? Thats how. Its the same basic concept. I hate to break this to you, but pvp is just a long "do this when that happens" script running in your head, which ofc you can turn into a bot with fairly decent scripting/programming knowledge.
---
Thing is, if the basic setting is available, a core engine for botting so to speak, then everything else just becomes scripting. More sophisticated bots that can fool you into thinking they are a "real" person are just smoothly scripted with lots of work put in to avoid "botlike" behaviour (running against a wall for minutes, always "reacting" the same way, etc.)
---
The basic scaffolding for those botting engines has been published in certain forums about 3 months after gw2 release. That scaffolding then gets used by botters to create an API for their bot scripts. They re-use stuff used in other games that way, reducing the amount of work considerably. Because in the end, every game works the same way... thats how players like it, its what makes it possible nowadays for you to install a game and immediately dive into it without having to constantly consult the handbook. But the same convenience also made botting a lot easier.

When linkservers (where GvG guilds stack) get newly distributed this changes. 
---
Maybe Jadesea, too. Some gvg frenchies moved there over Christmas, depends on if some of them will stay. 
---
Fight server communities are considered to be ‚Äûtoxic‚Äú, so you only gonna have fun there if you play a meta build and use discord/teamspeak. 
---
Other question: how are your getting unbound magic.over there
---
Heh. Honestly, emoji seems to be less popular now than it used to be. Right now edgy half jokes about being depressed and anxious are all the rage. Is your program teaching you about how to look out for student mental health? The kids are hurting. 
---
Where i get the magi armor i have all expansions
---
&gt;and that little search box over there would help you much faster
---
Given that this was answered near instantly, you're clearly wrong.
---
It's all client side, it doesn't modify game values, and it's one-directional - you cannot influence the game world in any way with it.
---
I'm working on Aurora now. Is there some reason I can't put it in a shared inventory slot and move it around characters easily that way?
---
That would require anyone at ANet giving a flying fuck about addon API.
---
What does it do? The few links I clicked on I saw no difference in normal overlays and stuffs
---
if you can't find a reason to play, don't. it's a game, so as soon as it becomes a chore, that's it. ruined.
---
it seems to be like you're trying to accomplish everything right now though. just set some short term goals for yourself to help achieve your long term goals.
---
also, are you in a guild? you should definitely join a few of you don't want to pug fractals
---
Thnx m8x I‚Äôm coming from Maguuma I know the toxic no worries ;))))
---
Will the giveaway questions be in the squad chat?
---
Spvp uses separate gear system so it doesnt affect your choice at all.
---
If you play pve only, guardian and maybe rev and mesmer (based on new stats that are coming on tuesday) will have good amount of different builds.
---
While it does end up not making it after a certain point, the Springer does take less fall damage than most of the other ground-based mounts. 
---
I don‚Äôt have hard numbers, but I believe only the beetle takes less damage from falling, although it kinda feels like it depends on how fast you‚Äôre going. The Skimmer and Gryphon obviously don‚Äôt take fall damage. 
---
They really shouldn't. Weapons being resisted is much better for balance and the specs themselves. Weapons are designed for a spec and each spec has a specific purpose. It could lead to large balance issues, or things like hammer being nerfed because it's too strong on holosmith even though it's already weak on scrapper. 
---
You'd just be creating the exact balance issues elite specs specifically avoid for good reason.
---
is that a mf jojo reference?
---
And videos too. The Verge's "How to build a pc" comes to mind lol.
---
Yeah, I've tons of boosts. Maybe I'll do that and do each personal story step with a different weapon, see whether I like any.
---
Considering that their were multiple Joko in the fight, who better to dance with Joko than Joko?
---
Happens every few months for me. Don't worry.
---
Traits reworks, elite specs, gliders, mounts, currencies in wallet, wardrobe ....
---
I mean he says Jojo in the title 
---
No, there isn't. It's juste a hassle for most people who have/use many alts.

You can see one of my previous comments about performance here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acqibj/after\_many\_many\_hours\_upon\_hours\_of\_work\_blish\_hud/edbkusm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acqibj/after_many_many_hours_upon_hours_of_work_blish_hud/edbkusm)
---
Do you mind either replying here or PM'ing me with your desktop specs so that I can try to emulate them as best as I can in some of my testing?  I recognize that there is a large range of systems people use to play GW2, so I want to do my best to make it accessible to everyone I can, where realistically possible.  :)
---
I can't speak to the mount issues you're having, but for the various lag spikes, I do hope that some of my [marker/path extension plans](https://trello.com/c/gGfGvGKG/16-marker-trail-functionality) will help improve this some for you (specifically the features that display markers and trails contextually)
---
For paths, it wouldn't be difficult for me to include an option to use basic vertex line drawings instead of sprite drawings for the trails, which would likely improve performance for some people at the cost of just being a simple line instead of a fancy arrow sprite.  :) 
---
Probably this yeah, in GW1's time every name was localised whereas when GW2 came out they kept the english names though they also kept the french ones for old characters from the first game.
---
&gt;    Future elite specs could even change the way you use weapons already available to the profession, for example making Mesmer greatsword melee instead of ranged with completely different skills when a particular elite spec is equipped.
---
Why not just make this a grandmaster trait for Domination?

Mordremoth's "main body" is the Mouth of Mordremoth. But via his domain of mind, he has a different style of hive mind than any other Elder Dragon, and can transfer his consciousness into his corruption, allowing him to micromanage all his minions (whereas other Elder Dragons need champions to manage the grunts).
---
Those vines are not Mordremoth but rather Mordremoth's corruption that his mind is inhabiting. Depending on your stance of the "ghost in the machine" philosophical debate, one would consider them part of Mordremoth, or not.
---
Well.. I do not like the glow but I like these "planets". :)

I love the shagginess of it.

Nightfury and Winter's Presence are skins.

My money is on our springy boy
---
This is something that I thought of when I originally had the idea.  To answer your question, YES!  That will likely come much later in the upgrade process, but I've got some infrastructure available to me that I plan on hosting a real-time marker API on to allow for exactly this!  I also plan on allowing for commanders to enter in their discord channels when they come in and then allow for users in the same maps to select commanders on their team to auto join their comms (further integrating with the Discord API available).  :)
---
This same thing could easily extend to other large (or small) coordinated metas  like TT, DT, AB metas, and even silverwastes.
---
I have a small workaround
---
1). You place aurora in a shared inventory slot
---
2. You buy the cheapest **account bound** accessory for each of your characters.
---
3). Place said accessory in the same slot for each of your characters.
---
The way this works is the cheap accessory that you bought serves as a placeholder. When you double click Aurora, it'll always go to the first accessory slot, and the cheap accessory switches places with Aurora and goes into the shared inventory slot. 
---
**I'm aware that this might be too much work for most people**. I have 15 characters but I have no problems with this. So take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Its alright, the only people who are are hookers and knit-bitches. (Guilty of being both) 
---
These are adorable. That dolyak calf!! I love that your friend used different textured yarns for different bits, too. GG to them, and congrats to you for getting such cuties.

Will this work in full screen mode unlike TacO which only works in window mode.

I wish we could get Tybalt hooked up to answer this question.
---
Character model limit to lowest, character model quality anything you want though lowest makes them look extremly ugly.
---
A Jojo reference? In this subreddit? It's more likely than you think!
---
Sounds great, thanks for the explanation! Making it open source could definitely be a gamechanger, what you said in the last sentence definitely resonates with me :P, maybe not so much for gw2 since taco fulfilled most of my needs so far, but definitely in other games that your tool supports if I understood the pitch correctly. I guess it can send basic http requests as well, meaning it could potentially interface with any other web service and get user specific information, not just from the official API, meaning there are almost endless possibilities on how to extend it! 
---
Does this addon do anything with the achievement panel? It would be fantastic to be able to navigate and track achievements with the objectives instead of a simple percentage. Also, it would be nice to look at an objective and be able to navigate back to the parent without navigating through the native left column panel.
---
Coding is NOT magic. I know it's popular to think it is lately but I wish this would stop. Coding is actually hard work and even more-so when you talk about a game of this caliber. 
---
On top of that there are priorities. Some things are way more important to fix than other things are. Usually bugs and new content is much more important than these type of things. 
---
Also, when something like this is "fixed" it is sometimes people working outside of their normal working hours to get it to work and that needs to be appreciated.
---
I'm just going to point out that WoW's transmog system is completely outdated and nowhere near as impressive as GuildWars2. 
---
In all honesty, it's a bit too late for an aura wardrobe. Such a thing would function like novelties at this point, which means there'd be no limiting the amount of auras people have nor would it be useful for housing gear skins that have/are auras.
---
Unless they were to strip out the old items of their function, which would be fairly tedious to handle.
---
I've been doing it since late 2013 because it was my GS skin until I made my first legendary twilight :D

I meant regarding the engine in general. Keeping itself updated regarding graphics, optimizations, etc. I don't know about in-game content.

---
Thanks my guy :¬£ 
---
Yea, i was thinking it would be a  hybrid weapon. However it would be weird whereas the condi build would be more burst oriented and power builds would be the consistent damage. There would have to be a trait somewhere in the spec that converts a little precision and ferocity into increased bleed damage and something along those lines for the condition damage build as well.
---
Just wanted to see if i could climb to plat from the very bottom. Never again xD
---
Could've been worse :)
---
I was not ready for this but I'm glad I was able to experience it.

That bright, though? The staff doesn‚Äôt look like any staff that I can recall seeing in the game. 
---
2k hours here and the only cosmetic infusion I use is Koda's Warmth BECAUSE it's not an eye-sore.

You can use the mumble API to get some data. The raptor leaps at around 38 m/s, that's around 720 Joules per kilogram. The springer leaps around 26 meters high, and the gravitational acceleration in Tyria seems to be about 15 m/s¬≤, that corresponds to an energy of about 390 Joules per kilogram.
---
Energy per mass unit means I have to multiply by the mount + character mass to get the total energy generated by the mount, which I don't know. However, looking at them, I imagine their mass is about the same (the springer is fluffier, but the raptor is longer), so I'd say that the raptor legs are stronger.
---
A remarkable concept. If you plan to add more onto this, I will look forward to it quite a bit~
---
I'm not kidding when I say staring at this image makes me eyes bleed.
---
Yeah, not. You are wrong. 
---
Complaining or bringing up an issue isn't against the rules at all (and I never said it is.) It's the *way* how he did it. 
---
You can't complain abount an issue and shoot around to get attention and think people will listen to you. It's not the issue or complainment what's wrong, its the shooting. I know it's an extreme comparsion, but it works the same way. 
---
The way to bring up an issue is the problem here, not the issue itself. 
---
If only one screenshot were the problem, the screenshot would be deletet. It's not only the screenshot.

Season end in less than 3 days and decay starts exactly 3 days after your last played ranked match.
---
What exactly do you mean by legendary mounts? Unique mounts that are difficult to obtain? We already have the Griffon, and adding more mounts that are equally or more difficult to get would probably not be well received.
---
Or do you mean legendary mount skins that are obtainable in-game similar to legendary backpacks/gliders? I'd be up for that, there definitely need to be some mounts skins outside the gem store.
---
Warrior basically has four roles -
---
1 - PVE - Banner Support -  Fine as a core warrior.  Tactics, Discipline, Strength.  You can Go Axe Axe and either Great Sword or Mace Mace.   Take a physical skill (Kick, Throw Bola) to trigger Peak Performance and two Banners and you'll be welcome in almost all fractals and raids.
---
2 - PvP - Defensive Duelist.  Fine as core warrior.  Defense, Strength, Discipline.   You can go Axe Shield and Great Sword.  Take all the passive defense stances.  Run to your home point and wait for customers.   Spam your shield block and don't give up the point.
---
3 - High End PVE - Condition Damage - Berserker skill set.  Beserker, Tactics, Arms.   Longbow, Sword Torch.  Preferred in raids.   Build up adrenaline and then longbow firefield spam.  Watch those burn and bleed procs roll in.   Can still take 2 banners, or can run with more rage skills if there's another banner slave.

4 - PvP - Memes - Core Warrior.   Rifle, Great Sword.   Take all the signets.   Build up adrenaline and then hit Signet of Might and F1 on a squishy.   This will occasionally result in your getting a kill.  It will also often result in you dying.
---
So if any of those fit you, there you go! 
---
Same here... I'd like to use legendary trinkets, like weapons, for the flexibility, without adding visual noise. Perfectly fine if other players opt in for a visual cacophony, just allow me to opt out as well.
---
If items offers multiple FX, like aura + animated orbs in case of Aurora or footprints + active-only eye-candy with legendary weapons, it would indeed be great to handle them discretely.

Would anyone be able to suggest a Season 1 Recap considerably shorter than DreamyAbbadons one, but of course more in depth than the game one?

While his is absolutely amazing, the time clocks In at way too long for my friends just getting into the game.

Is the Pharus the name of the new longbow?

Is the name known?

Thanks. It would be pretty cool to see something like it in the game one day, or just the use of the spear.

I'm new to the harp and just been practicing some simpler songs from tabs. I understand brackets are lower octave, while parentheses means to play in the higher octave and / means these are chords.

Thank you!

Even then, raw usage is important. If having a mesmer in every game cancels out the other, then that would be the same as not having any, but thats not the case. For example, if every game has a mesmer, but not no team ever has an ele, then both classes would show ‚Äú0‚Äù usage, which is not the case. I want to see how often every class/build is played, broken down by rank and amulet, as well as traitlines. 
---
Honestly i think it is healthy for the game, all competitive games out there has this feature for transparency and competitiveness. 
---
I don't think you have enough knowledge to make such guide today.
---
Just a reminder that fashion wars was way better in 2012 than it is in 2019. Too much flashy bs now. Not that it was perfect in 2012, and yes there are more options now, but most players you saw were in reasonable attire.

Excellent. You deserve a cookie for that.

That's pretty much what the griffon is. What they need to do is actually make mount skins available in game and not through the gem store. 
---
I want to see it broken down by:
---
Class usage and win rate, where we can organize and see ranks, amulets, traitline and sigil/runes break down.
---
Every competitive game out there has this feature already. Heck, even better: enable API and let the smart web developers work their magic and come up with even better ways to organize this. Also, make it so that it is open source API and not just those who want to share it, cuz it gives incomplete stats and thats the same as having nothing, or worse yet, misinforms people.
---
If we're postulating lore/story themed GSs, it could maybe be related to Aurene (rather than Kralk) or even the Mists (however that would work). We are supposed to be Aurene's champion, so maybe some kind of crystal dragon powered greatsword similar in effects to when we were carrying her egg in HoT.
---
Wait, SHE'S the voice of the GW1 narrator? She is responsible for so much nostalgia... 
---
If you're gonna go for memes you can also play a berserker spec rifle one-shot build, it's more fun imo.
---
Could this plague be the work of an enemy stand?!?!
---
First of all, what class do you play? Some classes counter thief/mesmer better than others, and how you deal with them varies depending on your class.
---
Pressing the M key requires *alot* of concentration.
---
I wish they had more aggressive use of some weapons, like hammer or shield! (For instance, a Ranger would be a great example of an aggressive hammer user (affectionately known as a Bunny Thumper)).
---
I think you didn't understand my point. What I mean is that there's already boxing animations ingame, thus fist weapons require less work, since they can recycle those animations.
---
If there were no boxing animations ingame, I would probably not even consider fist weapons in the first place, and made them mace skins instead.
---
huh!  
---
i never knew such high-frequency API's existed, that's interesting!
---
No, the fists I'm fine with, it's the other categories I mentioned that are the problem.
---
Lack of sleep?
---
I felt like vial was a better option (necromancer potions and stuff). However, it's funny you complained just about this one, because in [my previous version](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/712235/#Comment_712235) mesmer had vial instead of bell, and necromancer had bell instead of vial. It was a last moment change.
---
It could still appear as the weapon of a future elite specialization, even if I'm not very enthusiastic about more off-hand weapons there.
---
Awesome I‚Äôll try the free version. You‚Äôre very welcome, thank you for being so helpful!
---
Really? I bet they‚Äôd talk your ear off about reality I mean the Eternal Alchemy
---
Unfortunately not (at least, at this time). It looks like you're not the only person to have asked this question, though, so I'll elaborate a bit on why that is.  
---
(If somebody more knowledgeable than me notices an error in the following, please feel free to correct me so I can update this)  
---
When a windowed application is rendered, it occurs off screen, and the OS (Windows in this case) manages the completed renders, compiles them into a final graphic, and then sends the final result to the screen as part of its compositing process (which is done by dwm.exe - Desktop Window Manager, in case you see this in Task Manager and are curious). This is what allows you to have a window overlap with another Window (or even just two windows open on the same screen).  
---
You can think of it like a newspaper where each article or section of a page is assigned to a different person. Before publication, a compositor takes all of the articles and ads and decides where to place each one on the page.  
---
This is what allows overlays like Blish HUD and TacO to work. While the compositor is working on deciding what to send to the monitor, Blish HUD informs it that it has some extra content it would like to send and that it is *on top of everything else*.  
---
When an application is fullscreen, it renders straight to the monitor instead of giving Windows a chance to include additional content (which is why there is a performance improvement in most cases).  
---
Using the same newspaper analogy, it's like assigning all of the page's content to Guild Wars 2. Since it only wants to include output from the game, that's all the newspaper includes before it is shown out (on the monitor). It gets exclusive control of everything that gets printed.  
---
   
---
So then how does ArcDPS or gw2 mounts work even when the game is fullscreen? They use something called a DirectX injection (which is a fairly well documented and common technique) which allows them inject themselves directly into the rendering pipeline of the game itself.  
---
Using the newspaper analogy once more (honestly, I think I'm a bit too young to be talking about newspapers this much - ha!), it's like having a "man on the inside" at GW2. Basically, after the writers are done with their exclusive page articles, they pass it to an intern to take it over to the printers. What they don't know is that the intern has a pen with them and they mark up the article with some additional content just before giving it to the printers. This is also how applications like FRAPS (which will display FPS in game), Discord (with its chat UI), and plenty of other applications inject themselves into the game like an overlay does.  
---
So why can't Blish HUD just use a DirectX hook to get around this issue? Well, it could - and it's even something I've considered ([especially now that other wonderful people have done the legwork to make it more accessible to .NET applications](http://spazzarama.com/2011/03/14/c-screen-capture-and-overlays-for-direct3d-9-10-and-11-using-api-hooks/)) and it may be something I look at more seriously down the line.  The first major issue is that very few DirectX injections have been approved that I know of. They‚Äôre literally injecting themselves into the game‚Äôs rendering pipeline, which is a bit more intrusive than just rendering on top of the game (and I‚Äôm not wanting to tread the line of what‚Äôs approved and what‚Äôs not approved by ANET ‚Äì they have enough work to do as is). This also means that unhandled errors in the injecting application can cause the primary application to also crash ‚Äì which isn‚Äôt good for anyone. The main addons using this method right now are fairly simple (in terms of what they do while injected ‚Äì not how much effort it took to make them) and add some nice QoL features, but they‚Äôre not implementing features on the same quantitative scale as Blish HUD or TacO do (and the more that‚Äôs going on, the larger the injection footprint ends up being). So ultimately, it‚Äôs in my notes to take a look at in the future, but it isn‚Äôt something currently available or even in the plan to implement.  I'll likely base my plan of action on community feedback.  :)
---
But you have only played 120 games? That's not that many at all.
---
Necromancer would never get fists, these new weapons are not supposed to be for every profession.
---
As for fists, technology-themed professions wielding giant mechanical fists is a classic, so no problem there.
---
It looks fantastic. That you've used MonoGame gives me hope for potential Linux support, as well - us GW2 fans over here would love it :D

I don't know about a *God* (I'd hate to somehow end up in the Commander's crosshairs), but I think I'd be okay with a Snaff prize.  :)
---
The same thing applies. New weapons should include distinct animations, else what's the point? New off-hand weapons need distinct animations, and we already have some ingame that could work.
---
Vial has drink, spill, and throw. Bell has the animations used for the musical instruments.

---
What would be the function besides being only a fancy skin? Legendaries usually have additional features. Would it be too much trouble to elaborate? Or give your ideas? (Hint: dragons don‚Äôt make sense)
---
As /u/ginx2666 clarified, yes, it's all client side (other players don't see a thing) and doesn't affect in game terrain in any way (your character can't physically interact with any of the things displayed).  In the GIF I posted of the traffic cone, you can see me kind of walk through it.  That's because it's just an illusion to have it look like it's in the game.
---
The things displayed are meant to act as a convenience to let players, for example, share gathering routes easier.
---
In regards to your question about it being legal: the concept isn't original.  Another application, TacO, uses a similar technique to do much of the same thing and the community has considered it to be safe to use (with some minor head nods from ANET staff).  They have a policy on 3rd party tools and I've worked hard to ensure that Blish HUD doesn't break any of those guidelines. :)  You can see more details about this in a comment reply I made earlier to somebody who had a similar question: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acqibj/after\_many\_many\_hours\_upon\_hours\_of\_work\_blish\_hud/eda8ddn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acqibj/after_many_many_hours_upon_hours_of_work_blish_hud/eda8ddn)
---
Hopefully that all makes sense - feel free to ask me to clarify anything you might still have questions about.
---
Nah
---
If you are at all on the fence about joining the training and trying out raids in guild wars 2, this is an opportunity that you should not miss.
---
A couple of guildies and I joined a squad that just completed a raid with Swifty as our commander and trainer. It has been a great experience so far, everyone was friendly and helpful, and we killed Vale Guardian. Looking forward to more raids during this event and into the future!
---
Thank you Swifty and everyone in RiT for a fantastic event!
---
I don't hate the idea, I just think they would work better as an independent element, like a special profession mechanic. Following the example above, a thief elite specialization, the assassin, with a kusarigama kit, with special movements and animations (which you wouldn't get with a conventional weapon, because weapon skins need to follow some common rules for every profession).
---
It's the same reason why I don't like "musical instruments" as weapons, I'd rather get a mesmer elite specialization, the minstrel, with a dedicated combat music role that gets to really shine out. But just my personal taste.
---
Something like a warrior monk ex the for honor shaolin monl
---
Wasn't that the spider they never finished because of people with arachnophobia?
---
I thought you meant unlimited in the sense that people would be able to stack an unlimited number of auras on a single character. And when I said "only 1 aura at a time" I meant per character i.e. you wouldn't be able to do [this](https://youtu.be/dgGiKHfYdJU) anymore.
---
Skill animations already repeat - that's fine. There's not enough design space for those weapons themselves as distinct categories.
---
Focus has bells, and items that look like vials, and musical instruments. It's already taken up. How much variance would you expect for those things, being their own categories? Not enough.
---
MMR lucky i guess, im not a good pvper with my 200 ping and zerker stats. I just dont like condi though
---
I'll accept this as canon.
---
Let me leech in peace
---
Nonsene. While NCsoft owns Anet, they're not slavers. What happens next is a matter of discussion, negotiation and assessment. Mix some white into that black and make it grey.
---
We no longer get new aquatic weapon skins, so this would help refresh underwater fashion wars a bit too, which is really, really stale.
---
And yeah, this subreddit has always been like this, sometimes you're lucky and sometimes you're not. Some people with no life love patrolling new to downvote everything that is a "threat" to the status quo of the game. Healthy discussion like this should be encouraged to let ArenaNet get feedback, but this is what we get instead. The same happened with mount threads back in the day, many which addressed very valid concerns that never made it to the top; then of course, we had controversies all over the place, when it was too late to fix. *Sigh.*
---
Im sorry to hear that but generally its anet fault. Current matchups and linking is bad, plus content is , null.
---
On the other hand , most of guild that leave servers go for those wonnabe good server that fail in quite short time, like vabbi did and like ros will .
---
Why fractals are different than they meant to be. They were used to depict historical, well known events like ascalon conquest or thaumanova disaster. I can understand Arkk arc because it's about fractals itself.
---
What about Deep Stone? There is nothing there related to events we know. What about this one? Any story behind? 
---
There is no much that could be done like Rytlock journey through the mist, helping legendary spirits to get their aid.  We could fight thorough ring of fire to defeat undead Rurik. 
---
There is an amazing opportunity to put lions arch evacuation, using whole map of the city,  with epic battle on breachmaker at the end. Map is already done guys! I'd love to see Turai Ossa original fight with Joko or a battle against Klarkatorrik as Destiny Edge. So much potential to redo our favorite moments from gw1.
---
But no, instead we are getting new stories about events that may or may not be relevant some time in the future. I don't want eye candy maps or fascinating new lore. I'd like to expand my knowledge about past events. 
---
Anet please!
---
Well, if the next expansion is Cantha, I could imagine some sort of 'kung fu' fist, but it's not suitable for every class obviously
---
It'd suck if it was like "Thieves now get to be assassins with death touch.   Mesmers now get to be kung fu masters with death touch.   Guardians, you can now use a Spear Gun underwater."
---
I have 3000 hours but I had good tastes, I don't like to look like a walking christmas parade, and I'm not crazy enough to craft a legendary weapon.
---
Approximately how much golds would crafting a harrier set cost to me? I've never crafted an ascended so dont have much knowledge about it. Also some say that there'll be a new meta set for healers in January 8. Is that true?
---
That would shit all over balance, I hope they never do it 
---
Don't know why everyone complains about infusions all the time LMAO. Infusions are great btw just too many people go over board. This is defiantly one of those times. 
---
And then insult each other as to why their version of an answer to a given statement is obviously superior and so on and so forth...:D
---
We have giant spiders in the game since day 1 and also a spider glider. Kind of a weak argument by them.
---
Pink-Eye outbreak.
---
Needs moar aviators.
---
Griffon is imo the best thing anet ever added to the game by far.
---
Just have the same mantra skills underwater as you have on land...
---
Welcome back.
---
"But my loot bags might despawn by the time I get back".
---
I assume that you can stay away from NPC spiders for the most part and gliding isn't that much of a permanent thing (we actually have a spider glider?), but it's probably much harder if everyone and their mum has one as a mount. But yea, I was disappointed as well.
---
Unlimited as "no more than now". Or rather, it'd be "same as now but plus however many auras the wardrobe allows".
---
I love the dye on the raptor!
---
Lol? Buy that expensive bag from gemstore so that you can wear every character
---
Legendary weapons collections are very easy, time isn't even a factor here.
---
My biggest point here is: 
---
Playing other MMO I feel forced to pay and then forced to play. If I want to be on other player level, I need to be active, play a lot or fall behind and play even more. And pay no matter if I have time.
---
In gw2 I feel completely fine to abandon game for a month or more, to finish other titles, then I can come back and still be top. Nothing to grind, never to fall behind, always have something to do. Even being in a guild is easier. Many guilds, mine included, don't kick players for inactivity. Player cap is 500 so there is a space for players getting long breaks. 
---
Peace of mind. And it's free.
---
1. Most of our streamers are too chill and not interesting at all.
---
2. We got ZERO memelords autistic streamers. (Which can be funny or entertaining.) 
---
3. GW2‚Äôs auras and visual glow diarrhea doesn‚Äôt help much either.
---
4. Actually ZERO battlegrounds and only 1 PvP game mode, conquest. Making the game look extremely repetitive.
---
5. WvW is a running simulator when streamed.
---
6. PvE loot is a joke compared to WoW when it comes to RNG drop of a mount or  equipment. So PvE in GW2 is not exciting to watch.
---
And I‚Äôm one of those people who REALLY want GW2 to do great on Twitch and Youtube. In addition to Facebook Gaming which apparently it‚Äôs a thing now.
---
Those are shoulder pieces. 
---
AURORA is an accessory. 
---
No accessory has a skin
---
So frustrating ... I just ragequitted because GW2 disconnected me, I don't want to waste 30min re doing what I just did ...
---
Takes skill to play mirage ....
---
Were you from the future? Because the new longbow is literally made from light lol
---
The max jump distance for the raptor is [1600](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raptor_(mount)) units, while the max jump height of the springer is [1050](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/High_Vault) units. 
---
Comparing this to elite human athletes, the world record long jump is  8,95 m while the world record high jump is  2,43. The "human" ratio of length:height is thus  3.68, while the mounts length:height is  1.52.
---
Going off of these numbers, the springer is stronger than the raptor by more than a factor 2.   
---
yes power mirage clearly takes skill and even more with only 2 utilities you can use for yourself
---
i understand you right and replied to that. power mirage needs skill, more than most other stuff esp. soulbeast. condi mirage is one of the easiest in  that you would be right but even that is not easier than soulbeast, holo, core guard and most other classes on meta builds. the whole meta is pretty brainless tbh thats why i dont play meta condi mirage, i play power. as said feel free to rpove me wrong and show soem high ranked pvp vs decent player with my build, to prove how ez it is.
---
Happy Birthday.  
---
granted only lv 13, but so far I'm loving my Bearbow
---
just buy 2000 gem mount skins them they're legendary enough
---
Often enough people don't understand the level of complexity and work that goes into coding.
---
Especially trying to work with, updating and sorting through old code that had/used an old way of doing things.
---
Plus.. people who often bitch about code are people who have never once in their life actually looked into the sort of coding required etc.
---
It's a classic.. don't know shit about something, but fully experienced enough to bitch over it.
---
Correction: Accessories *didn't* have a skin... Until Aurora.
---
Accessory is still a gear. It is selectable among the wardrobe even if there are zero options for wardrobe skins. But a skin is technically defined as a visual addition connected to an item.
---
And Aurora has a skin: the purple mist and four orbs. 
---
It just isn't a skin _accessed via the wardrobe_.
---
Yet.
---
WoW has much more money to invest than Anet does.
---
Paying an experienced coder isn't cheap.
---
I tried working something out using very rough measurements, and surprisingly the raptor seems to be coming out on top. To cover such a great distance in such a short time, with a very short 'kick' off the ground, the raptor must be kicking off harder (even accounting for how the springer is working against gravity more). 
---
Moving away from pure calculations, I'd say that in a contest of impact force (like a kick to the chest) the raptor would win. But in a slower contest, like an arm-wrestle style thing, or like pushing a boulder with their legs (back to a wall), the springer would probably do better. 
---
When the WP is basically right next to the fight and they still won't get up -\_-;;;
---
Probably around 25g a piece including the recipes, maybe a bit less, for 150g total. Not including leveling your crafting. Full ascended would be around 250g.
---
Always been the same thing for Messmers and you just use the same mantras under water and it will not vannish.
---
Red is often a default color used to indicate the dyeable areas in a texture.
---
If that dyeable area isn't given a color, it'll look red. 
---
This is easier to see in some backs with corresponding dyeable glider, like the [moth wings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Moth_Wings_Backpack).
---
Nobody ever had to look inside there, so there was no need to check that, until someone put a chair there. So they got overlooked.
---
You are too generous
---
Buy the game. It solves all of your problems. 
---
Can't wp while the party is in combat. Unless we're talking open world bosses. In that case those players are probably worthless anyway, and them staying dead is an insignificant loss. 
---
They will tell you the journey was the reward... 
---
I just finisbed mursaat tokens last night and need to do lake doric. Its for real the longest achievement grind ever. 
---
To top it off, not even sure its stat swappable? Skin is not re-usable? So i cant use it on other builds characters.. 
---
Makes me not want to do it and do a weapon legendary instead :/ more value for effort
---
Yeah, it's still going on for another 9 hours. There's multiple groups being formed non-stop, it's crazy. =p
---
If you run fractals, I believe it's cheaper to craft the grandmaster marks and use those to buy ascended gear from the golem. You can stat swap ascended gear using an exotic inscription or insignia, so it's sometime easier to craft something else and do that. 
---
The new set coming out next week has lots of boon duration and damage but no healing. Good for boon support, bad for healers. 
---
Harriers is expensive so don't worry if you can't get it straight away. 
---
Yes, how dare they not give you unrestricted access for a product you haven't payed for? 
---
There is a Core Game purchase you can make that gives you mail and markets.
---
Just earn gold, turn the gold to gems, and purchase the Core.  (I believe it's like 150 gold? )
---
Soon you won't need to worry about servers in wvw! 
---
I am b2p and I think giving you the game for free was a mistake.

Can anyone confirm for me what time the PvP season 14 ends? In game it says to me 10:29 on Tuesday 8 January but has no mention whether this is server time or my local time? I recall the announcement for the season saying it ends on the 7th?
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they withheld a Lunar New Year celebration back till Cantha appears ingame.
---
There's plenty of festivals in DR anyway.
---
Eh? You sure about that?
---
Passed LA today and it was just as full of people as it always is. Not sure why your instance looks like that. Maybe it got empty and people did not map change. Maybe it was some off hour? But tbh i pass LA during all times of the day and night and i never felt it was empty ever. 
---

If *that* kills your immersion, just wait til you run into people with over [3k hours](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/acoqy3/in_a_nut_shell/) :'D

I agree with you. I have have my headphones on the table when i play my norn females. But i also think it is about personal opinion and as much as i can not stand the female norn voice without cringing hard i know just as many who think it is great. So i have just left it at that. 
---
Yes, but [the model for this mount](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/18/12/f2181254deaa7e7c9d24ee42c804679c.jpg) was also datamined, which would be a multipeople mount.
---
Shhh. Don‚Äôt let the time travel police find me üòÅ
---
The thing is, underwater combat is inconsequential and realistically the only time you enter water is when trying to reach the other side... So it really shouldn't handicap you to just slot the same mantras as you have on land, this stops them from resetting. 
---
FFXIV did it better.
