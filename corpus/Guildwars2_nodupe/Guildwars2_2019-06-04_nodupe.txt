i play other titles (pso2,ragnarok,wow,ffxiv) but gw2 is the only one of those that give me heavy problems with fps. very high demanding games i dont play them on pc, if its on console i prefer to play them on console so my main focus is to find something afordable that will let me play gw2 with decent fps, not necesarily max. i though i would spend at the least 300 on the cpu and gpu but i searched and think those two would do just the trick by a much more reasonable price, not even going above the 200$ gate, but sure, im open to more suggestions :)
---
---
---
Fort Aspenwood!
---
Yes - it is coming in handy for me now since certain alts have certain maps unlocked, in my case
---

---
From what I heard though, you need to go to Gorrik with the character that started the collection. They get the updates/etc, even though other alts can collect. :)
---
Thanks!
---
Have you tried the invigorating precision trait? It heals you for a % of the damage you do. Combined with pistol/pistol and the trait which gives you might when use unload, it's nearly impossible to die.
---
Not the most optimal way to play but it's the super easy way to ease back into the game until your more comfortable.
---
Thief is incredibly squishy without that trait, but with it they become one of the easiest classes to play in PvE.
---
I would finish the HoT map completions with just a glider before getting a mount, just to see what it feels like to really have to explore.
---
What a stupid post.
---
they just fixed it. yeah, I'm a bit surprised they didn't do a hotfix sooner, but there was enough of an uproar that it was clear they would fix it eventually. 
---
other, older bugs are not so lucky, unless something is needed for  current content, it often lands very low on the priority list. so say when dragon blood weapons collections inevitably bug in the future, it'll probably take way longer for a fix. that's why it's always advisable to try and do these types of achievements as early as possible while the episode is still somewhat fresh.
---
I guess i read the same as u. Feels bad, baited.
---
Yea the 20 minute wait is dumb. They should either remove it, or move the big chest onto the augury events directly.
---
I think the wait is due to the ghost of turai pilgrimage though.
---
In which case Ryzen and the RX 580 will do just fine, as others have said Ryzen 3000 series is going to launch within a months time so you could wait and likely get a 2000 series much cheaper either used or new.
---
I'm running a 1700X right now and frankly the performance for GW2 is just alright, I have a 1080 as well but that doesn't mean a whole lot, fra kly speaking so long as your visible players setting is at the lowest or medium and their texture detail is set to the same you'll pull pretty decent fps even with most of the others setting maxed (excluding pointless stuff like super sampling of course)
---
Anyway, Going Ryzen at this point gives you a great and cheap upgrade path down the line for Cpu's so for good price/performance and your situation it makes the most sense.
---
I suspect the problem is that they don't know what causes it to get stuck.
---
[This.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/11/Jade_Shard.png)
---
Build with fix is live now ^^
---
The public tracker likely has to be updated manually.. I wouldn't be surprised if whoever updated it stopped because they got too busy.. (or left/got let go)
---
If you played through HoT with a raptor I doubt it'd change your experience much. HoT masteries are primarily about verticality (jumping mushrooms, gliding etc) while the raptor is gotta go fast - it won't help you in 99% of the situations where gliding or bouncing mushrooms will help you, and things like tarir teleporters or nuhoch wallows are superior to raptor speed.
---
People have touched on most everything here. I would definitely look into a metabattle build. I really liked Pistol-Pistol deadeye. Spamming mark and unload would rip enemies apart. I ended up switching to staff daredevil and, while I still love the pistol spam from before, I also really like have three dodges and tons of DPS.
---
Thirding this. The jungle is meant to be hard and intimidating. The mounts, particularly griffon, vaporize that threat. With that said, obviously don't torture yourself. If you feel like you're hating the game because it's too hard to get from point A to point B (something GW2 has a problem with in many areas) then getting the raptor at least might help you out.
---
Also, maybe just me, but I couldn't stand the idea of playing the story out of order.
---
Seers armour and the greatsword of the dragons deep? 
---
My reaper has the same loadout
---
[The Dragon Bash login screen music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fYmmlYDsQU) was still the best there ever was.
---
what is the third image?  I know what the last one is.
---
Skyscale treats remain bugged.
---
Your server = in the best tier.
---
Servers in tiers above you = tryhard nolifer losers
---
Servers in tiers below you = worthless scrubs who you farm for drops (if they wipe you, it's obviously because they're cheating and/or you gave them pity bags)
---
A few with Viper's, but I generally prefer power builds...which was one of the reasons why everyone is geared up. A set of Zhed's, Nika's or Devona's armour on the TP usually cost 6-10 gold. Some have Marauder's, one has Sinister, I've got a set of Grieving from that PoF collection, a set of Harrier for my Druid...why, I don't know, I never use it for Healing, but I guess one day I might.
---
What I really need are Bladed Runes. Like a 6 pack set of runes that you can buy that you can select the type from. **That'd** be useful.
---
Are you planning to get expansions? I mean it’s kinda early to ask but your use case for each class changes depending on if you want the expansions. At the core level Mesmer, ranger, engineer, necro, elementalist are lacking and need expac specialisations to perform. If not you’ll be good with Guardian, warrior, thief.

Thank you! &lt;3
---
fantastic post. informative and transparent. even acknowledges personal responsibility while informing about the solution. this should be the standard for game dev communications in the industry.
---
I've got *ahem*...a few characters. I generally only need one build per character.

---
Thank you! I really get the pain, it's hard finding good charr armor in general :'D
---
If they are like me they will be gone again after they get whatever carrot they came back for.  The game hasnt been made more fun, theyve just added enough carrots to chase for people to come back for.
---
And build template websites. A ton of assets won't load.
---
Aside from colour. These dont look alike
---
Holy cow! Good tip, thanks.
---
Well I don't have this perception. Actually, the main difference, specially regarding the online world is that since the dollar is usually what dictates the price of stuff like electronics, cars and online products, we usually pay, let's say, 4x more what you guys pay. Think of it like, if you have to plan your expenses in order to purchase things, we have to do it 4x more to be able to afford the same thing. But ya, this notion that because of that, Americans or other people from rich countries own us anything is wrong anyways. If you wanna ask for anything back, you should be going for governments instead (specially from countries that explore/d the 3rd rate countries)
---
&gt;opened on acquisition
---
I would really like this option.
---
And expensive!
---
Agree wholeheartedly. To get people to go back to old maps they need to add new events\ metas, not just farm map currency bullshit. Very poorly implemented collections.
---
I'm for it
---
I've got ~~33,000~~ 35,000 Airship parts. I could afford at least one set.
---
Nothing
---
The joke is on you! You actually need thousands of Trade contracts for that!
---
Cheers :D now we can finaly progress \o/
---
As I said in my OP, my first playthrough was as a Sylvari so he was already established as a mentor/friend and didn't come across as a Kormir spotlight stealer (which means it's more of a poor writing thing rather than Trahearne's fault for all the hate). So can't agree with you there, however, I LOVED Rurik and that is a damn excellent idea.
---
When possible it always helps to cache a backup for your program to use in the event that the server cannot be accessed. I know for EI we have a list available for all the relevant skills in the game
---
Oh man that would be a dream for all the alt gearing I'm doing right now
---
Akili being fixed is nice but they really should tweak the Visions of Istan part of the legendary. The sheer amount of Kralkatite and Rose Quartz grinding required for that episode is several times more than the others, to the point that Istan maps are full of people camping the Astralarium waiting for meteors to fall, and the Great Hall, Palawadan and Brewmaster events constantly fail with nobody doing them.
---
Well you prompted me to add a section in my guide so now there is [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Add-ons).
---
They're a QoL upgrade in HoT maps like Tangled Depths for sure. But I'd still recommend trying out the maps naturally for the first time, there's an odd sense of accomplishment when you complete those maps without the mobility and freedom mounts give you.
---
It doesnt limit player economy - it keeps it in check. And also ensures the players themselves do more to interact with the game than just cash&gt;gold and buy it off the tp; it gets you to see what items you want and actually build up mats/achivs to aim for it. Most notably leggy armor, backs, and gen2 weaps. 
---
When i first started took me 2years to even get ascended armor, refused to craft it because i hated crafting in every mmo, but looking back it was definitely more involved that just "clicking buy" at an npc.
---
If your friend is the type of person who like to play with different stats on their gear, I recommend farming Bloodstone Fen.  You can get a set of four trinkets; everything but the two accessories.  
---
The Bloodstone Fen trinkets are unique because 100 Unbound Magic buys a Bloodstone Capacitor, allowing you to reset the stats on any or all at once for the same low price.  
---
Similar pieces may be available on other maps, but once you pick the stats you can't change them.
---
It depends. The maps and enemies were designed without mounts in mind. Mounts will be more convenient, but mean you can bypass some mobs and terrain obstacles by using mounts. OTOH, when the expansion was new you had bigger map populations. They will let you move around faster, which could increase enjoyment. Or maybe you'll feel like you are cheesing the map. However just because you unlock it doesn't mean you have to use it.
---
As for whether to play through one set maps or switch between them, that's mostly personal preference. Inventory management will be a bit easier if you stick to one, and you will have to play through the story episode at a time anyway.
---
Personally I unlocked the raptor, bunny, and gliding out of order, but other than that I chose to play in story order, ie. core, LW2, HoT, LW3, etc.
---
&gt;be a Power Ranger
---
This got a chuckle out of me
---
I mean - they used to soul-bind everything - all locked to a single toon - the current system is much better. Atlantica Online has an economy that goes crazy - each new items brings crazy high inflation.
---
Except they will still never be able to experience Season 1 living story.  I really feel bad for players trying to catch up through all the story while still having to miss that part.
---
You could give Daredevil a shot. With all of its evades I find it significantly easier to stay alive with than Deadeye.
---
If you need hero points to unlock a specialization, you can very frequently check LFG to find HP trains in HoT zones. That will give you a ton if you join in Verdant Brink and complete the entire train.
---
I managed to do all the steps too (I also have two emails linked to my account which both recieve the newsletter etc) and have not received any mail for the purple mask. :(
---
If you think the vanilla story is good, you're in for a treat later! :D
---
DO NOT post exploits.
---
If you happen to find an exploit send details and evidence about it to: exploits@arena.net
---
I would argue the bigger issue is the Kralkatite payouts across the map.
---
Thunderhead's collection requires crafting Dragonsblood weapons. Those take 60 map currency each. If you hang around Thunderhead for 2 hours, scour the map for mining nodes, do the hearts on one character, and do the metas, you'll probably wind up with more than enough to craft one weapon.
---
In Istan, you need 500. The hearts give 25 each (5x compared to Thunderhead). So if you go and assume the costs are inflated five times, well then it should be comparable to 100 map currency elsewhere, which is already more. Except the rewards aren't inflated 5x everywhere. The three world bosses give 15 Kralkatite each. The sunspear caches are sort of the map's "mining nodes", but they (usually?) only give one Kralkatite.
---
At least one meteor tends to drop during each of those events, and a single meteor will net you more than 15 Kralkatite. Hence why nobody is running the metas.
---
Not to mention, you still need the rose quartz powder which you will only get from the meteors. Otherwise, you'll have to shell out a decent amount of gold to buy it off the TP if you get your Kralkatite any other way.
---
I have just returning to the game, starting fresh with a boosted Elementalist . It has the basic soldier exotics gear afaik. Are there any builds around it for mainly solo world content and some aoe tagging?
---
I get your frustration, but the alternative is that everything can be bought with gold, which can kill the sense of achievement you get by getting things and move the game a long way down the "pay to win" spectrum.
---
I remember when I wanted to craft Stellar weapons and I couldn't find anyone else at all interested in getting meteorites, because everyone just wanted to farm the Great Hall repeatedly back before it was nerfed.  What is it they say?  Oh, how the turns table?
---
Seer armor (awesome set) but with [Dark Harvest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/f/fe/Dark_Harvest.jpg) if you can believe it... I’m not great at drawing weapons haha
---
Give us a bloody data table that shows you getting 8+ gold from Serpents Ire, so far this has been you playing the victim and not providing a single number for us to judge truth off of.
---
There are, but none of them will include Soldier's gear.  You'll want to get out of that into Berserker/Marauder's gear as soon as you can.
---
Yep. It's designed to be. 'S right there in the name. One of the best-made maps in GW2.
---
Choya Fighting was Available during the PoF Beta, working as intended. My idea is that it resembled too much to Illegal Cock fighting so they removed it
---
+1
---
So, I've gone from 1.5m Karma to 150k Karma because PSNA, Aurora, and funny tonics. I'll be needing a lot more karma than I currently have for the rest of the stupid trinket, any suggestions for boosting karma?
---
If difficulty puts you off, then get the mounts first. If critical engagement (not at the level of Dark Souls but not a walk in the park either) is more of your thing, then do them in order. Only maps from Path of Fire onwards were designed with mounts in mind.
---
In my opinion having a mount on a first run through of HoT and Living World 3 trivializes a lot of the content, its okay afterwards for when you take alts through though.
---
But...it's *balanced*. 3 Charr, 3 Sylvari, 3 Asura &amp; 3 Norn. Each one has a light, a medium &amp; a heavy...then there's a boat load of humans. All told, 3 of each class, one base, and one of each elite spec. Maybe if they come out with another elite spec I could pick up 9 more, but even then, it seems like a bit much and it takes me quite a while to run through my dailies.
---
SoulSherpa reply is spot on; that being said, my personal advice would be to get a couple of the most used sets of stats, such as zerker and viper doing winterberry farm and metas in Dragonfall, then move on to other stats or explore with bloodstone trinkets.
---
Unpopular opinion, I think it's better NOT to get your mount until after running through HoT. It's an entirely different way to explore the jungle that you'll just never experience if you have a mount from the get go.
---
Where do I find Gorrick to get another recipe sheet?
---
Both of then are aspects of poor writing, Kormir was even useless in this game as well. There's a fantastic write up about rurik if you Google "rev elite rurik" someone made a few years ago
---
Originally you could  buy and sell legendaries.  You still can. Players called the game pay to win and wanted legendaries you had to make yourself. At least some of this is player requested. Sorry you don't agree.
---
Where do I find Gorrick to get a new recipe sheet?
---
I've been going to that map for a while and didn't know that. My regular numbers were 25, very far from 40.
---
Dammit Jim, I'm a fighter not a doctor. -The Commander
---
Taimi's "situation" is that she has an *incurable* genetic disorder. The Commander is a fighter, a killer if you're grim, who's plans are made up on the spot and is more reckless than tactical. They're not a doctor who can cure the incurable.
---
If Taimi's illness gets healed, it'll be a subplot not the main focus. And it'll be done by something we might barely interact in assisting, not being the main actor in solving.
---
Do meteors daily until you hit your cap, will take you 3 days. There ate multimap farming squads.
---
I absolutely love this idea. Is there a place for us to officially tag devs or submit ideas like this?
---
just make sure u wipe ur feet
---
Asura's "normal villain" was Kudu. Charr's was Gaheron. Sylvari's was Faolain. Norn never had one.
---
Caudecus certainly got the best focus of them, but ultimately, they were each tossed aside the moment they got introduced.
---
The only villains that had their fair share of screentime was Scarlet and Balthazar, and both were ultimately Elder Dragon plots.
---
Whatever villain comes next, will either be short lived, three episodes tops like Joko, or will end up being related to the ED plot in some manner.
---
Uh, Commander? I think we'll need a bigger ball.
---
The only delusional ones are you lot, everything you listed has happened to someone before.
---
Lots of the older gentleman where. Kicked out of their homes at 16 for just existing for example.
---
You are not special or unique it's all happened before.
---
Check your  [https://gw2efficiency.com/tradingpost/history](https://gw2efficiency.com/tradingpost/history)  to make sure
---
They react most to magic open in the world, not magic inside other beings. Hence why Primordus began waking up from Abaddon's death, and the Elder Dragons slept the entire time the Six Gods were traversing Tyria.
---
I thought Legendaries don't give you better stats than other gear?
---
Isn't Ventari a Centaur?
---
They don't. But this game isn't really based on stats anyway. Top stats are easy to get. Some people mak the argument that the end game here is cosmetic. Being able to buy the rarest/coolest weapon skin in the game is essentially winning (to some people anyway not saying I agree).
---
The point is, people argued that a legendary weapon is a sign that you've worked on something hard. If anyone could just buy it it loses part of it's value. That is to say it doesn't show work and so your accomplishment becomes meaningless.
---
That's why gen 2 legendaries are account bound.  A lot of people who play MMOs feel this way. I happen not to be one of them, but many did ask for legendaries not to be able to be bought and sold.
---
Submitted a ticket about not being able to make gem store purchase and as expected, it was resolved within the day 😄
---
Karma train in WvW.
---
Ooooo. Good point!
---
Hey guys. Need clarification on ascended gear crafting. I have heard conflicting reports about time gated materials.
---
Some YouTube videos highlight that certain materials are time gated. However others state that you can buy the materials off the trading post.
---
I guess the question is. If I have the laurels to buy the recipe and the gold to buy all the materials.. And the profession levelled to 500, can I craft an ascended piece immediately
---
My achievement was showing I needed the Corsair Jerkin to complete Visions of Dragonfall. I unlocked the jerkin and the collection changed to Corsair boots. I already have the boots unlocked but did not get credit retroactively. 
---
I have submitted a ticket.
---
Check out Dragonbrand, it’s alright on the charts and is currently on a slow but steady upswing points wise. Depending on the time of day you play it may or may not be busy. Usually though there is always a tag running around.
---
I can relate.
---
Teq is a good chunk once a day. 
---
Silverwastes isn’t too bad if you tag events ankles keep moving. 
---
Karmic retribution on lw 3/4 is an other option.
---
Alacrens are still pretty rare in t4 pugs, so many groups go with firebrand chrono comp with chrono dropping all quickness skills. So if you want to play chrono, it’s still possible to play in t4’s (will be slightly harder in cm runs). Just make sure to tell the group you’ll just pump out alac and adjust the comp accordingly.
---
If you plan on getting to cm runs or static groups, ren will serve you wonders. It’s pretty uncommon to find one, so finding pugs will be easy, of course it fits in the firebrigade meta comp too, so you can get into groups easier and will be welcome more than a chrono would. On the other hand, t4 groups won’t care about having a chrono.
---
So I guess it depends on your goals. Do you want to get those sweet rewards from cms or join a static to get everything done really quick? Ren will be a great investment along with your dh. Do you just want to keep playing t4’s casually and never bother with the harder stuff, chrono will be fine. Just make sure you’re playing what you enjoy; that’s the point of a video game.
---
I have the same issue!
---
I would go with a marauder's set of gear. It has power, precision, ferocity and vitality and a whole set will boost your ho by 60‰ at a 10% dps loss. You'll have 62% crit chance with marauder's and without any traits and runes being selected,letting you choose if you want offensive stats or more survivability.
---
It would be fun if these activities weren't necessarily on rotation but people could form teams and compete on a ladder for loot and reward track rewards.
---
getting back into the game and on my feet again. Few questions since my hiatus 
---
1. Mastery level order. Curious if im doing this right still.  Pact 5/5, crafting 1/4, fractal 0/4 (guild wasn't that great at the time and could never join a fractal team). Gliding 5/6, itzel 4/6, exalted 3/5, nuhoch 4/6, magics 1/6. Raptor 3/4, skimmer 3/4, springer 3/4, jackal 1/4, I do not have the other mounts yet. 
---
2. Crafting. I forgot I was basically dedicating myself to 1 toon and got the 3rd and 4th craft slots but hadn't used the 4th at the time of my hiatus. I have art, weapon, leather right now. What would be a good 4th option ? (playing mesmer ATM)
---
3. crafting guide. What is the most current one? Im finding that I still need a set of vipers and I can only make the vipers armor ATM .
---
In addition to what was already said I’d highly suggest taking a look [at this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character)
---
There are four ascended crafting mats that are timegated to one a day and are account bound; Spool of Silk Weaving Thread, Spool of Thick Elonian Cord, Lump of Mithrillium, and Glob of Elder Spirit Residue.  These mats cannot be bought on the TP.  They can then be turned into ascended materials that are not account bound and can be sold on the TP and are what you need for the later crafting steps (e.g. Lump of Mithrillium is account bound but you can turn it into a Deldrimore Steel Ingot which is not account bound and also needed for later steps).
---
Thanks; it showed I listed it. I also just got \~60g in the TP. It looks like it got delayed somehow!
---
That's super interesting that the T1 servers really don't have top coverage most of the time. Like maybe they have one top coverage section, but the rest are between 5th and 10th. Meanwhile NSP should logically be in T1 or at least T2 if it has top coverage in 2 timezones, wouldn't you think?
---
A sourced quote from Wikipedia:
---
&gt; whereas jadeite shows more colour variations, including blue, brown, red, black, dark green, lavender and white.
---
Haha figured that's what you meant. So ya, weaponsmith to craft your weapons (sword, greatsword, shield on chrono, axe on mirage) or chef to be able to craft food.
---
an all-out rush across tyria/the mists to find/return with a literal miracle?  that sounds like something the commander would do.
---
What is begged with the treats? At release I had no issues with that, and my gf also had no problems last weekend.
---
Yeah, and having to aim to use Steal on someone makes it even worse.
---
Yup, my brain and autocorrect got the better of me.  Double oof.
---
oh I see, I was thinking it was a copy paste sent out to all the GMs by some higher up.  That makes more sense, although it is still bad.
---
exactly what I was thinking
---
Alas, if its not on fire, its lower priority than what is
---
This has been bothering me a lot recently as well. Wish there was an option to always show enemy models.
---
The spirit the OP died to doesn't display a name, sadly.
---
Sounds like a psycho...
---
The art of the Drunken Fists translated into WvW mastery.
---
I’d recommend searching YouTube for some getting started or beginners guides. Overall, the idea is to capture and maintain points for your team, and upgrade their defenses. It honestly has the highest replay ability of any mode in the game, and is a blast, but getting started has a bit of a learning curve. 
---
Reach out on map chat to see if anyone is willing to mentor you, see if your server has a Discord, look for any commanders to tag along with, and don’t wear berserkers or vipers armor (get something with some vitality and toughness). This is a wonderful mode, hope you stick around after getting your cat (which is totally useless in other modes, just so you know).
---
Basically show up at the right time, right after reset or right before it should do
---
If you're familiar with pve world bosses, it's like showing up to do dragonstand at 10am or something lol that map only fills up after reset, it's the same for wvw
---
Yeah that’s fair enough. We'll probably get a blood legion uprising at some point, hopefully that won’t have much to do with dragons
---
i use invigorating precision, healing signet and assassin's reward [not mandatory, but i added this one since i started using sword trait after they boosted] on my "story\open world" thief build, even going full berserker, it's one of the tankier build i ever played, i just have to watch for giant attacks.. but.. hey, sometimes they're so unbalanced that they would kill even a full minstrel tank in open world, so..
---
I’m the commander of the pact, and you’re watching the Disney channel.
---
Most of account bound items can be converted to some sort of different "currency".
---
Reusable gear would mean a lot of trouble for gw2 business model. And if you would try and implement int mechanically you'd end up with a different kind of game anyway.
---
daily fractals
---
Springer has a issue with spinning. While Skyscale dont. However Skyscale do not jump actually.
---
I actually liked that a lot about HoT masteries. PoF masteries have such low requirements that you can easily finish them in a couple of hours max.
---
\&gt; Crits enemy
---
\&gt; Weapon melts
---
I just came back after 3 years and sure was happy about the mini story after HoT giving an ascended wep. Limited choice but a nice catch up.
---
To a lot of people here, HoT content is the content they enjoy. Everything that came out after pales in both difficulty and exploration compared to HoT.
---
I would say get the basic raptor (get PoF and do the first quest with the dialogue off for minimal spoilers) just for the convenience of the speed while running around. without masteries it's not going to let you bypass any of the HoT movement mechanics or spoil the difficulty, but not having to slowly hoof it everywhere makes everything feel better in general.
---
Yeah true. And it's not uncommon that people with BPD have depression on top. Really explosive combination that should be treated by an expert.
---
Mounts makes it a bit more easier but I'm glad I experienced Heart of Thorns without mounts.  I was more immersed in the story being in the dangerous jungle not knowing how to get around and trying to stay alive.  It made me a better player.
---
Try SoS. It has near zero toxcity. People don't really care about hardcore fighting. Most play for fun. Efficient NA blob. Decent coverage. 
---
But yeah, there are dead hours too. It just can't be fixed.
---
The problem arises because of Mesmer illusions. They take up the model limit thereby preventing encounter models from rendering
---
You could lower the Character Model Quality instead of Character Model Limit. You will still see everything but you will get default model instead of Mirage with shiny armor and thousand of aura.

When CD was last place T4 for 6 months, it wasn't a challenge for well known cmdrs to pull 50 in squad during NA. Fights on T3/4 are generally quite a bit of fun and quite large. Again, mostly thinking NA. DB was an exception a few weeks ago... NA was dead but they had a high night crew presence.
---
That's illegal.

are you saying they should contact..... paragon support

Easiest would be to ask around on the server what times things are more active, and prepare a scourge or herald so you can join the zerg. I know my server has a morning problem when it's basically deserted. 
---
The other option would be to pick a roamer build, pick a random map and just start flipping stuff. Even towers and keeps can be taken solo.
---
Or 75 each day from hearts, multiplied by however many characters you have. If you have enough characters, you can do it in a single day.
---
Could also say the same about non-GW1 players for most of the other legends tbf

---
Not necessarily more fun. The HoT maps are designed around the HoT masteries. Some of the more hidden areas are also really hard to reach and you need to think about how to get there only with gliding and jumping. Thats half of the first time experience in my opinion. Let's say you unlock mounts first. You can jump over pretty much anything with the raptor. An higher up PoI or mastery point? Jump with the bunny. You loose so much of the exploration these maps where designed for if you just bypass most of it with mount movement abilities.
---
This said. Mounts will make you time in HoT MUCH smoother and less dangerous. So whatever you like more I guess? :)

If “a lot of your bank and inventory is stuffed with such items” it sounds like you may need to identify what all these items are and figure out if you really need them or not.  I can’t say I have the issue you’re describing which probably is due to knowing what’s valuable/necessary to keep, so figuring out what you’re holding on to should be your next step forward if you haven’t already
---
1st thing I thought of reading the title
---
If you switch WvW maps or leave WvW while mounted, your default will switch to the Warclaw.
---
What other proof of ownership do you suggest?
---
Toxic? Becouse i have differend opinion and i dont support any kind of *special snowflake*  treatment towards adult? 
---
I merely stated the obvious fact that is actualy true for all of my friends. if you believe being gay is normal, then you shouldnt act as special snowflake, there is no *straight parade*, or "straight community", why? Cuz its normal, you believe you are normal? Then dont make urself special and differend about it. 
---
And why the fuck, would i turn off reddit? Im not the one who cant handle differend opinion. His reason for stopping playing wvw is absolute bs and im saying why. Yet i get shit on cuz I pointed it out
---
If you perceive arrogance in pride marches, you don't understand what they stand for. 
---
Lgbt people are very obviously discriminated against more than left handed people, which makes the op's 'joke' a flippant and mocking.
---
I didn't respond aggressively. You're the one calling me childish. 
---
I pointed out the obvious difference in those two cases which is a difference in levels of current mistreatment. Lgbt are killed in the west and east. If you want to make up a gamified points system, go for it. But don't criticise me for participating in it because you're the one perceiving it that way.
---
Honestly, you gamify discrimination and call me childish. You call me childish and criticise people who get aggressive. You call both sides dumb(ery) and think you're better than them cause you're taking a centrist point of view.
---
&gt; Becouse i have differend opinion 
---
No, because you worded your comment like an offended jackass.
---
I don't. 
---
One simple thing I want to point to:
---
* Permafrost Dye from a birthday gift dye kit.
---
Most of our account has thousands of gold's worth of default unlocks. Permafrost Dye is something a number of people got last year and it is fricking great along with the dozen or so other dyes I've gotten that were worth 300+ gold at the time of me picking them. Some of them dropped down, but I got to enjoy them early, that early-bird time has value. XD
---
And on a more serious note: Exploring the game's flaws and watching it progress through patches is part of the fun of playing an MMO. We got to witness things change. I think a lot of us revel in that, in seeing the game progress as we constantly scramble towards what's meta.
---
Yes, you can. But you will need Valor traits for that  
---
I suggest Valor 1-1-1
---
Is it really worth the risk, though? This is an issue that they would never unban you for doing.
---
But what if some people prefer the current animation instead?
---
Pretty sure HOPE, Eureka and Exordium at least took heavy asuran input, possibly Meteorlogicus too. And I'm not sure whether Kudzu really qualifies as sylvari-themed as opposed to Melandru/generic plantlife.
---
You might think so but it's actually not illegal per se just highly unethical.
---
Hey, I started my GW2 experience as an engineer. Let me know if you want/need help with builds.
---
&gt; ...won't even bother to grab these skins and legendary weapons at all because of how normal animations are simply locked off to them.
---
I doubt that. Its not like the weapon/skin is only usable on mesmers or something. Its weird that asura/charr mesmers dont spin the sword with the auto's. Maybe anet could change that at some point in the future. Consistency of skills seems to be important recently so there is hope.
---
What is your timezone?
---
Thanks
---
Just to make sure, what is the normal trait for support minstrel fb?
---
That's fine, I'm just talking about the majority of players who would like to see the animation and not get left out.
---
The only one I know for sure is the Forgotten Seal accessory for one of the Season 2 stories. They're account-bound as well, so those could be something. But the S3/4 maps are probably more fun and you get ascended.
---
Until you provide some statistics that PROVE it's the "majority," then it's just stereotypes. You perceive it as the "majority" because of confirmation bias.
---
And stop playing dumb. You type exactly the same way as the sockpuppet accounts. You're so obviously lying it's painful.
---
This but with skyscale atm. Whenever I go for a mount or legendary I always picture myself how much fun I'll have doing all these things but WITH a QoL mount or pretty fuck off weapon.   
---
The HoT metas are always what first comes to mind, VB was an absolute joy when I got the griffon and even more so now with skyscale. VB has a great meta that I never get bored of (unlike tarir) so I'm really enjoying doing the meta and making some cash all on the mount and with a legendary I spent so much time grinding!
---
Life is full of danger, people attack people for no reason, your reason is you are LGBT, some for skin colour, some because they are goth or whatever. 
---
My point is everybody is attacked and treated badly for a reason, some as petty as "personality" or "I don't like your voice" at the end of the day you are no different to any of us. 
---
And thats what you want right? To be treated the same? 
---
If you are not treated badly because you are LGBT it'll be because of your skin colour, or your gender or your weight, it doesn't stop.
---
I haven’t even played it and it happened.
---
Assuming the individual dailies are kept this sounds just horrible to me. On "good days" you'd have winterberries and a load of UM/VM freebies and then there's "bad days" with 3+ timed meta events on the list. Multiple dailies on one map will lead to the exact same problem as the standard "daily event completer" already does on certain maps: a drought and long waiting lists as all eligible content is steamrolled the instant it pops.
---
In the current system you pick out the easy/enjoyable ones at your leisure. You propose **forcing** people into the unpleasant ones (making some of them even *more* unpleasant in the process...) without actually fixing the individual tasks to make them enjoyable. Who wants to wait for 3 more scarab-stomping events when nothing changes over the first 2 and a giant zerg is already fighting over the bug pools?
---
I dunno it feels like they were all meant to be different. Dragon's Stand is amazing and I can't imagine a meta with that much polish was just a "failed" VB...
---
In leveling, I found that spirit weapons are a must in DPS at least till level 40. The sword deals tons of aoe damage + vulnerability, making leveling from struggling in v2-3 mobs, to fairly easy if you make good use of spirit weapon. 
---
Plus they're on 1s cooldown, with 3 charges, and 5 seconds for one charge to restore. It's basically one of the leveling skill I made use the most to kill boss and aoe mobs.
---
Not recommended in my opinion.
---
I'm one of the people returning. I played for a while at released then stopped playing since then due to University "full work mode".
---
I recovered my account because I saw something about GW2 today (I don't even remember what), but I suppose there is a reason I heard about this game I completely forgot for 5+ years.
---
Since I'm apparently not the only one, what's happening?  
---
Why is there a big influx of people coming back to it, or people willing to start playing after such a long time?
---
I say go after governments and huge corporations, here in America they're essentially the same thing anyway. But yeah I agree.
---
Besides, I'm 99.9% sure that person was bullshitting in order to try and score some free shit anyway
---
Thats an aspect I did not consider. I believe I didn't level a character in 4 years.
---
I had to craft a full set of zeolot exotic for my hybrid druid when HoT came out and tbh it was just a nusence. People need to craft anyway if it's a build they play (ascended) and having an easier option to get the exotic will help them decide if they should stick with a build or not
---
&gt; Most people who have these two races for their Mesmers won't even bother to grab these skins and legendary weapons at all because of how normal animations are simply locked off to them.
---
Speak for yourself, I had a very simple (and race-independent) criterion for crafting Exordium: does it change the visuals of the beam itself? Eternity is a waste because mesmers almost never swing it, and phantasms don't get a copy either.
---
my problem with them is that not only do they take forever to finish, some of them also feel really low impact, like the "you can now use X vendors" ones
---
Yes, thanks for outlining the fact that there are many layers to oppression.
---
You don't get it. Imagine you're a fat kid. Yeah you're treated badly because you're fat. Now imagine you're a gay fat kid. Now you get homophobia on TOP of everything else. 
---
Pride is about being open about who you are in the FACE of all that. What's wrong with that?
---
If you can only accept us when we hide, then it's not acceptance.
---
Funny, present me is also lazy while demanding to past me
---
If you have time to spare, do fractals as well, ideally with the account wide karma upgrade. I'm at maxed karma upgrade, the amount of karma I get from fractals is ridiculous. So much so that I no longer view Wintersday as an important karma farm.
---
Tangled Depths is fine once you get a few masteries like the wallows.
---
Mounts made it even easier to navigate.
---
there's no reason they can't also scale up or down the objective numbers, i'm just advocating for a variety of daily content. maybe also balance them so that there is an equal number of easy and hard ones per day or a 3:1 mix like the daily PvE, PvP, WvW system's daily distribution
---
The slices on Deimos have also been problematic for myself recently with them disappearing at times after having shown. All my settings are on max. Similarly, the text on Xera to signify using the shield special action is intermittently not displaying for a number of people in the groups I raid with.
---
The IT'S DYING part is when the Commander kills Mordy in the Dream.
---
Go for full Berserker gears and visit metabattle site for builds. Open world builds are surprisingly sturdy whilst putting out respectable damage. If you have PoF, Weavers are hella fun :D
---
Hand. Hand2. Hand3. Hand45. So much orignality !
---
In my opinion - the devs have gotten much better at telling the story of GW2 with the expansions.
---
The way that the story is structured in the expansions is a lot better than the core game story. I'd still recommend doing the core game story, but I would say that the expansions are much better IMO
---
How do you get vision crystals?
---

You should precise what you're playing (or what you like playing), and if you have a goal in particular.
---
To be fair, mobs crit you for up to 8k. There *is* very little margin for human error.
---
(Looking at you, young wyvernlings @ Wyvern Matriarch, critting me for 13k the second they spawn and are still invisible.)
---
That's why there should be model limit for players and npcs on separate sliders
---
Are you surprised nobody sane will lead or try to structure or organise YB?
---
Anyone who tries gets flame, REEEEEing pugs, next to no players willing to adapt, try or listen but 10+ monkeys spamming siege in nearby objectives to leech abit of loot.
---
YB became like this because of its toxic players refusing to do anything other than siegemonkeyism for 5+ years. And when half decent players that try leave, even siege doesn't cut it.
---
Active friendly wvw pug communities cant exist for long in gw2. Too many leeches demanding lots of stuff but giving nothing back to make it feasible. Best solution is blatant toxicity to rid yourself of atleast a fraction of the carebears.
---
It's sad but the state of the game isnt where you nicely ask people to join and they wanna organise and play with you. Most players will refuse and commanders that wanna do this rely on their guild or friends rather than pugs. That's why most of the pugmanders on almost all servers are gone. Pugs dont want a commander to socially play with, they want a guild to hard carry them while they leech.
---
All things we knew years ago, its just slowly getting bad enough to affect the trash players that caused it.
---
it's been like that since the start of the game.
---
&gt; I have gone to VB before the patch at almost all hours and there was never a tag and almost always a server transfer pop-up.
---
Yeah, and every time I go, there's a tag every other time and I get server pop-ups occasionally which is NORMAL. Then I have new friends join and ask about their experience over the months, and some lean more to your side, but many lean to my side.
---
You're letting anecdotal experience cloud your judgment and blind you from how MOST people experience things.
---
It's okay that VB wasn't the most organized map. It's the launching pad of HoT. People do stuff, sometimes go back for organized runs for achievements, and move on. They still will after the slight hype of this change dies down. That's okay too. This the nature of things.
---
Based on my experience this is the go-to method for every IT department :)
---
On EU tiers dont translate to skill. But in order to be #1 in ppt you're either trash or you will be soon.
---
Taking #1 means bullying siege monkeys which will quickly move to you instead. And along with it comes a lack of organisation, huge queues and a fairweather attitude.
---
The best strategy for ppt is still avoiding opposition, which is exactly what fairweather pugs do especially with queued maps. Enemies show up? Go hide or swap maps. No enemies? Band together with 50 pugs and beat them with players. Defense shows up? Disperse again. Wait until they attack you under your siege.
---
That's why typically t1 EU servers despite much higher coverage dont have much higher kills either, not to mention terrible kda against half decent servers. They're spending most of their time avoiding eachother.

If he's 10, he shouldn't play this game. It's rated T, not E.
---
Mount/dismount is very quick, It was designed to be so specifically to encourage mount swapping as you change terrain. 
---
What game have you been playing?
---
Nah I thought it would be new raid, but still no kappa
---
I totally agree with that. Let us use our tools and get better to play the game...
---
Mesmer weapon animations far away from being fabulous, at least for me. At least beam should change its color/texture but nooo, here is your pleb purple beam.
---
You'll lose out of the mastery system on your account but you'll get to lvl 80 fast enough for that to not matter. Masteries comes with movement abilities like gliding (from HoT) and mounts (from PoF) so you will be a bit limited in how you get around. But that's how people played the game for three years. And that's what the core maps are balanced around.
---
I started the game back when HoT had just came out and bought HoT to get the chat restrictions lifted (I knew at lvl 30 or so that I'd stick around long enough for it to be worth it), but I still just played the game and the story until lvl 80. Say that it took me a week or two to get to 80? And that wasn't with me playing every day or even a lot of hours per day. One dungeon run was basically one level so once I hit lvl 30 it went quickly.
---
Run around, take in the world, do some events (the orange things on the map if you've forgotten) and check things out. You'll have a sense of the game within a few days. Join a friendly guild and enjoy!
---
Wait for AMD's Ryzen 3000, it's likely going to be the best option.
---
One where I don't have to keep landing to swap mounts and instead just keep on going on one :p
---
You also lower the FoV - nice way to zoom in.
---
They showed it beating in multi-threaded benchmarks and trading blows in single threaded against select CPU’s. 
---
From the information given intel still has the overall advantage in overall single core performance but at a significant premium. 
---
GW2 still sees better performance uplift from high single core performance.
---
its funny how in the jungle, the springer is king
---
Dunno if it's mentioned but sound. Like if I'm moving and the commander says something the voice just kinda gets, left behind. I hear her talk as if she's behind me and I'm running away. 
---
The voice isn't anchored to character (very obvious as soulbeast mounting/dismounting).
---
They showed a 3700X matching a 9700K (technically beating it by 1%) in Cinebench 20 single threaded. That's a 4.4 GHz part against a 4.9 GHz one.
---
*Yes*
---
even it intel might have a bit better single core performance, when ever you go for intel or amd, it would still be better to wait the 4-5 weeks since prices of most CPUs will drop even if you dont take the new amd.
---
Did that fuck just hit me with water on a stick?
---
For gear to get, if you're mostly going to play openworld stuff I would recommend Nike's openworld videos on YouTube, for Raids I believe Snowcrows website is the way to go, and for WvW check metabattle, and for PvP godsofpvp website or metabattle are both decent options, metabattle can teach you more about the maps and kitespots, there also jawgeous stream and YouTube content, aswell as sindrener Boycerino mightyteapot romshut drazeh naru vallun ajaxx streams among many others you can check out to learn
---
As to what you should be doing, well that's for you to decide, check achievements tab as it can gives you a lot of rewards and other goals you can work towards, there is also all the story content of season 2 HoT season 3 PoF season 4 content to play through, a few new fractals have been added you have the discretize.eu website that can help for gearing and seeing some runs from really good fractal players to learn about that.
---
With condi you have the luxury of dealing a lot of damage while constantly being on the move. I solo most champs with full viper condi warrior by just kiting the boss and slapping it with condies. You can’t die if you never get hit in the first place, time those dodges well.
---
just to make this clear... The WvW mount is absolutly useless outside of WvW. There's literally no need to ever get that mount, if you don't want to play WvW at all.
---
Maybe you should go outside for a bit, get some fresh air, and stop getting angry about weapon animations in game.   Just a thought.
---
I personally think this argument is truly fascinating. I'm not judging here but I'm curious.
---
Whenever this statement is made of "let people play how they want to play" it is always about something that is inconvenient and that something should change.
---
So this would be more like "change the game so that I can play how I want to play the game".
---
How is that better?!
---
Actually it's about the lack thereof. 😁
---
There's an animation.  Just not the one you want.  :-)
---
It's good to know that Raptor will not really change the game experience as it was meant to be experience, just aid the transportation process. Though I wonder if it's better to try HoT just once without any mounts, since, I think, after obtaining a mount it is hard to go back to running around without it. 
---
Though, I guess, I'd like to feel the danger of the jungle. Or is too much and too annoying constantly fending off enemies?
---
if that was the case, it would come this evening, like a regular tuesday patch
---
Lovely!! Your hard work paid off :)
---
Rushing through timegates. Are you a wizard?
---
I guess I'll first try it without any mount and then see if I'd like to get it prior to completing HoT :)
---
I'm in the same boat. What happened with WoW?
---
&gt;The main thing you need to get used to with regard to HoT &amp; PoF is using the LFG in the contact menu to taxi yourself into active, populated maps that are organizing for one purpose or another.
---
Thank you for the advice! I am new to all of this, at the moment I just explore the map, do hearts or crafting, level up, do the storyline "quests" - all solo. 
---
From what I understood, only the Raptor is to be had early in PoF, and it is the only one that does not radically alter the HoT experience, just help with transportation and avoiding enemies.  Not sure if I'd like that, I feel I'd like to try HoT as it was intended and if I get annoyed I'll purchase PoF.
---
But have you considered that asura don't make the weird constipated face with their animation
---
The newest expac, BFA, is... not well liked.
---
The content drop (8.2) that is expected to try and fix some of BFA's glaring issues hasn't arrived yet. It's been a while since the last patch. So there's a bit of a lull in WoW right now. People don't really log in because they know there's a new M+ (kind of like their version of fractals) season coming anyways, and a new raid coming up (especially since the last one was a smaller filler raid) etc.
---
I'm playing the way i want to play, i have no time to do skiscale, so gates do not bother me, i do little bit of it when i can and will get the icescale at some point.  
---
It's not like assscale itself is a must to progress in other content, which is good, if you compare to bouncy mushrooms or springer they were roadblocks in story, just as getting to certain level in core story, some masteries were needed to complete map properly. With cryscale we only have that one Mastery Point afaik, nothing more... 
---
So i can enjoy the other parts of the game and work on shitscale in the process. Yes I play the way i want, and i do not ask for a change.
---
Run away if it gets too much. :)
---
Or if you SEE a pack of pocket raptors...:P
---
You can buy Reaping (and other) Tools for Karma in all major cities, i.e. near the cooking station in LA.
---
Am I the only one player buying those tools that way?
---
I think I'd like to purchase it in the official store, so I'll wait!
---
Rhyhorn vs Mewtwo
---
Thankyou so much! 
---
I'm kind of a bit sad that they made it tradable just as I got mine as a drop.
---
LOLOLOLOLLMAfo
---
i know about the karma tools
---
people don't get a joke
---
I understand that argument but IMO it made perfectly sense to have it the way it was before they adjusted the gates. It was bound to the lore and you could only feed your hatchling a few each day.
---
Binding it to a charged quartz crystal was probably not such a good idea, maybe a recipe for a new item that then is being used for the 'Piece of Skyscale Food'.
---
But I don't agree on the last part. It is not content of 2-3 weeks but rather a little bit each day and not, as many want, do it all on day one and then never again.
---
We have seen this type already actually. When HoT released a lot of players farmed the masteries and some where finished in under a week. not long after that players starting to complain that there was nothing left to do. having something to do is IMO not timegated content.
---
I mean, whenever there was a timegate introduced in one way or the other people started complaining and said "that is not how I want how I play the game". I would totally agree that when the skyscale had a drastic impact on the gameplay like not being able to progress in the story or it being necessary for a raid that the timegates would be bad.
---
If you (in general) are an active player then why does it matter if you get it in a day or in a week other than the usual measuring contest? I also saw that players will leave or stop playing because of it which isn't really an argument either because if they stop playing because of a timegate then what would stop them from not playing after they unlocked it on the first day after release?
---
So people having the option to both rush or take it slow is somehow worse than JUST being able to take it slow?   
---
Like I said before countless times with these retarded arguments, it's all fine to shit on people if they wanna rush, but god fucking forbid you shit on people who want to be slow. Your playstyle isn't any better than anybody elses.   
---
Thhe skyscale timegates added NOTHING of value and it has been proves so countless of times AND anet nerfed the timegating. Move on
---
Good Point maybe next week :)
---
As of last Tuesday’s patch, crafting them doesn’t work. The progress bar at the crafting station fills up and does nothing in your inventory.
---
They destroyed everything that was good in the last expansion and retained everything that was bad. Then they told us to wait (while paying a monthly sub) for fixes.
---
People moved on.
---
That would be a super underwhelming 'gift' to all raiders.
---
im one of the first to get the skygate  
---
tell op to move on, after like 2 weeks and he still brings up this topic again
---
I also have a 3570k but @4.1GHz, I'd either wait for the  Ryzen 3000 later this year or for the gen10 Intel early next year.
---
I'll particularly wait for the gen10 since my 3570k do wonders in game.
---
Check achievement menu and pick what looks nice or something that's functional and has a good use. You dont have to get items just because they are new.
---
amazingggggggggggggggggggg i love you &lt;3
---
People will say that WoW went into a wrong direction. I just say that people just playing it too long time. There was a huge influx of players in WoW before the Cataclysm expansion, that was almost 10 years ago. People grow up, started to work, guilds disbanded, etc... and most people (who vocal on social media) play WoW because of community and raids, which needs regular attendance in WoW. As people starting to get jobs, starting to have kids, etc, don't want this anymore. And because of the subscription WoW is not the best game to play 1-2 hours per week. Sure, it's not a big money, but one still feel that they are wasting money for not playing. And GW2's no subscription model is a good alternative.
---
But this is only my 2c.
---
I imagine it'd be completely broken, sort of like SAB was.
---
wat? really? I gonna have to check that this evening!
---
Question is why is there a difference? Did we get a answer to that? I can not really understand why. Did they not make it in time? What stopped them?
---
s/d weaver definately, but to get there you have to play regular ele...probably with a staff which is one of the most boring things in game
---
The issue is more that human, norns and sylvari have another animation whilst asura do not. If everybody had the same then it would not be as big of a deal. But why leave out two races?
---
&gt; you are the one that want to change the game to suit your play style
---
No I don't I asked a question. I am really fine with either but thanks for assuming things you know nothing about.
---
&gt; if you want to play slow than ok i dont mind play slow but dont fucking drag me into it and force me to play slow too
---
how did you figure that? The Devs implemented it in a certain way, the people, which I think you are part of judging by your reaction, who complained that this is too much timegate wanted it to change. How exactly is this "me dragging you into this"?
---
&gt; i want it on day one cuz i like having things first and i play every day for more than 8-10 hrs
---
That is the answer I was looking for.
---
&gt; and again u dont have the right to force your play style on others
---
I think it is pointless to argue about this any further but let me try to make this clear.
---
You are wrong in thinking that I am forcing anything upon you, I merely asked a simple question and you got all offended by it. Your playstyle is as valid as mine but, and this brings me back to the initial question: Why would the game have to cater to your playstyle? You might not see it but my playstyle would be affected too. So far I only did it for like half an hour a day. With your suggestion of having no timegates I would also probably have done it in a day or maybe too.
---
So it is not about the playstyles but rather about the justification of changing the game in a way to make everything accessible directly.
---
Iirc gw2efficiency.com offers a service that shows you every daily thing you can do.
---
yeah wtf
---
I am sorry but what? There is only one reset in WvW every week and the normal server reset every day have zero meaning in EU since it is like 3 in the night for us. There are constantly players on the map and you do not need a tag to play WvW. People say this here on reddit and then players show up in WvW belive this and moan about no com as if they are not able to play the game mode without if there is no comander. It is utterly rubbish advice.
---
That moment when grim reaper getting rid off scythe and buying harvester.
---
Pretty much.
---
&gt; I would discuss it in a civilized manner if you had the intellect to do so, has it MAYBE just MAYBE occured to you to actually READ why those people made that argument or has it ever occured that maybe, anet fucked it up and is a shit design?
---
Oh wow, going direct to insults. Yes it occurred to me. If someone asks a question that might contradict your own opinion automatically needs to be an insult to you or anyone really. I asked and expected a discussion instead of name-calling. How mature.
---
&gt; It has been discussed to death
---
While you are right, does this really invalidates my question? If you are so offended by a simple question then why not just ignore, read past it or if it is such a terrible sight why not block me if you can't handle a discussion by trying to make arguments?!
---
&gt; having a timegate IN a timegate IN ANOTHER timegate is good design then you really are hopeless.
---
Again with those assumptions, really. Did I say that? I generally don't like collections because, by your words, it doesn't add any value by pressing F somewhere. Though, those collections gave me some lore I could read through which I like in comparison to the others.
---
I'm not excusing or anything I just wanted to know your reasons for why you don't like it other than "I just want to play it my way".
---
thank you very much
---
Iirc its stated in a tooltip (trait,skill,whatever) somewhere that a single enemy can not be hit by the same shade-attack(f2-5) twice.
---
It depends on the type of player you are. If you find story important and you want to play the game as it was originally intended, not having a mount is a no brainer.
---
By the same token, if you're looking to do things in the easiest, most convenient way possible, bypassing the progression and navigation that comes with the jungle, then you're going to want a mount first.
---
I'm the first type of player but I've helped both types through HoT.
---
Don't forget **sigil of ice** on **torch** !
---
Yeah, if anyone believes Faren's not a good person I dunno what to say. Excentric, overconfident, naive, you can say many things about him, but he's not *bad*.
---
Istan
---
Oh look! A lucky emblem!
---
You don't need any treats to do it.
---
Skyscale was actually in different tower there :)
---
but why
---
And you've been grinding for it for months. A several extra days arent game breaking.
---
a cosmic baby companion
---
&gt; the game should change just so that you can play the way you want! I don't really know what is so hard to understand here 
---
oh for fuck's sake   
---
the game gave you one option which is doing specific tasks on a timer which if u miss it u will have to wait another day that may suit one type of the player base 
---
  
---
the change we wanted is to give the players other options that suits other's play styles and yet you think by that it will only suit my play stye and not the other players.
---
before the glyph I couldnt be arsed to park alts at the pagga wood farm, but now I have 20 chars there and the chopping I have to do is down to 60 from 300.
---
11/10 would buy again.
---
From what I experienced you better go with the current 9000-series Intel CPUs. Intel has better single-core performance what GW2 heavily benefits from. In most other current aaa-games you'd probably be better of with the new AMD Ryzen 3000 Series Chips due to the better mulitcore performance per price ratio.
---
But better wait for the first benchmarks. We'll see
---
Lmao. This angry kid sent me *[another](https://i.imgur.com/QUVSafN.png)* angry PM from a fake account.
---
Oddly enough, they appear to have copied one of my comments (everything including and up to "Get some fucking self awareness" was written by me to someone else). Not really sure what they meant by that, seeing as my point is still valid and they've done nothing to refute it.
---
This dude needs some therapy XD
---
AMD's benchmarks clearly showed them matching/beating Intel's 9000 series at every price point, in single threaded performance, at stock clocks that are supposedly considerably lower than what the node is capable of.
---
&gt; the change we wanted is to give the players other options that suits other's play styles and yet you think by that it will only suit my play stye and not the other players.
---
Fair enough. But that was the initial question I asked. Why would you change the game? And now You finally gave the answer to that.
---
&gt; the game gave you one option which is doing specific tasks on a timer which if u miss it u will have to wait another day that may suit one type of the player base
---
What specific option are you talking about because I didn't come across this point in which I missed a timer and then had to wait a full day to do it again?
---
hm, problem is: there are always 3 different nodes in the objects. so its not really a good tool for wvw imo.
---
or am I missing something?
---
the way this game handles  culling is the worst!
---
it's not just models btw, sometimes it's other animation stuff such as KC bombs, matthias bombs and one of the worst..deimos green(some say this is a different bug though)
---
Not enough Karma??
---
Not sure if you are serious about that.. i hot millions of Karma and no idea how to use it effectively 
---
crafting results in less Gold per Hour than it would Need to be in order go be worthwhile 
---
i seriously thought about Dumping some Millions into orrian Boxes because thats quick 
---
to be fair i played a lot ans got that Karma because i played Lots of the here mentioned places like fractals or istan even got Karma bonuses on those..
---
Nothing burns harder than ice.
---
I only would do it when I had like 9 chars or less. for someone with a huge amount of alts, its draining karma too fast.
---
This is exceptionally painful on encounters where mirages are meta. On largos i see an army of player models but I lose sight of the boss. 
---
This game needs to have some priorities on what to render first.
---
&gt; What specific option are you talking about 
---
making the next steps of the collection unlock instantly without waiting 24 hr or even 2 hrs after they changed it, giving you the option to do the sub collection simultaneously not locking one behind another like the first collection you had to do medicine first to unlock the scales then the eggs and so on, thy made it like this cuz the devs are lazy as fuck and put all the collectables in the same fucking place.
---
&gt; I didn't come across this point in which I missed a timer and then had to wait a full day to do it again? 
---
if you started it before the 28th patch then you know what im talking about   
---
ppl missed the rest by 5 mins or less on the first day and then left doing nothing except waiting a full day to unlock the 2nd collection
---
surely you understand, that when you call it "original sylvari concept art" people will assume it's about official arenanet affiliated concept art?
---
Oh you're entirely right, I must've just glazed over it constantly because it was slightly greyer than the rest of the text
---
I bought mine digitally and misplaced the mail with CD key. Everytime I contact support and in need of proof of ownership I just unload all my personal (billing info) and account info including every single character from GW1 and GW2 (over 50 combined). It usually convinces them :)
---
gotcha, thanks
---
This situation is most likely. Today we get an announcement about the next PvP season which will be next week
---
good one
---
https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiipathoffire/info/
---
Pretty often on retailer websites, a few times a year on gw2 website (next one most likely in august).
---
probably a dumb question but i thought the raid trinket can't be finished yet so how do we know what all 3 of them equipped looks like?
---
It’s a gw1 feature I’ve wanted since the beta. The ability to move, resize and toggle the UI elements.
---
This.
---
Not to mention you'll probably save a few hundred bucks going with AMD too.
---
&gt; if you started it before the 28th patch then you know what im talking about
---
Can you a bit more specific! I started the collection when the episode released and fed my skyscale the last 3-meal set on the 28th.
---
Though I understand what you mean.
---
How many season have you seen that end 1 week and start another. Just be glad PvP seasons are shorter waits than real sport seasons.
---
This world has lived in fear from a sickness since its youth  
---
but none here fear the future because now we know the truth.   
---
The torment puts on quite a show, expecting us to yield,   
---
but there's just one course of action when we gather up our friends.   
---
BASH THE DRAGON! SMASH THE DRAGON!  
---
No more suffering, laid down to rest!  
---
And replace him with our friends!  
---
We send our best and bravest to attack with all their might,  
---
the skillful and the willful each line up to join the fight.  
---
The beasts may leave corruption in a swath across the land,  
---
but we now have the allies that will help us understand. 
---
No more suffering, put to rest!  
---
And replace them with our friends!  
---
Minions come in dozens from the Peaks and from the Shore,
---
But we face each wave with bravery and we'll never lose this war.
---
In every brawl a few may fall but on each fight we learn more,
---
and with our newfound knowledge we will finally save the world
---
And replace them with our friends!
---
Do you have a link to this build?  Can't seem to find it and want to check it out.
---
Idk about them, but I want the Siren's Landing backpieces and they're 315,000 karma... each... D:
---
Thanks! Just what I was looking for.
---
As i havent unlocked skyscale myself, i would have missed brandsstone research.
---
Yup, lots of dailies you don't get on a low level account, weirdly even daily mystic forger doesn't show up until you get at least one character in the lvl15-20 range (not exactly sure the number, just had one alt account with a 20 that got it and an alt account with a ~8 that didn't until I got up to around 20)
---
Technically things like [this](http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/03/ctrlaltdel-tool.jpg) would be considered a macro...
---
But in this case there would be no way that i know where you can proof someone is using such a tool.
---
could be that a random person decided to post some rare early sylvari concept art
---
#WE WON,DAY WAS SAVED,COMUNITY HAS SPOKEN. THX ALL PPL FOR SUPPORT AND DOWNVOTING THIS THREAD. 20 FAKE ACCS HAD TO DIE FOR THIS CAUSE,BUT IT WAS PURE ONE,IT WAS BATTLE THAT HAD TO BE WON,TO SHOW THEM,THAT WE WILL NOT BEND THE KNEE. WP GUYS,IM PROUD ON THIS COMUNITY.
---
Thank you!
---
I prefer going for intel but I don't know why.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Isn't it really inefficient though? As in, you're spending more gold on karma than you get back from harvesting
---
You're looking for this. https://gw2efficiency.com/daily
---
My character camping the Wyvern Matriarch is a Guardian with aub-12k HP. ;)
---
With that said, the wyvernlings up there spawn at the edge of the platform once the Matriarch reaches 50% HP.  When you know that, you'll be able to look for them coming to the middle, and use your dodges to avoid their attacks once they start to strike, given that you should never need to use dodges on Matriarch's slow, predictable attacks.
---
If you're being hit immediately by spawning wyverns in that fight, then chances are you're not standing in the Matriarch's face meleeing her, and you should start doing that because standing right under her feet is the safest place to fight her.
---
What exactly is this showing? No labels or explanation.
---
Is it splitting 24 hours into 5 and then counting the number of "actions" on that server in each part?
---
But the NA EST and NA PST timezones must be overlapping, so is it just some arbitrary number of hours?
---
Maybe OP reaped the one in Desert Highlands instead to preserve Anya's one?
---
I read that as renowned asuran gamer.
---
No need to add something similar to beetle racing, they could use beetle racing itself, thanks to the adventure version. 
---
They could merge guild races and other races and adventures into the same concept, giving all of them a regular event and an adventure version, and have guild missions use the adventure version instead races specifically made for them.
---
That way lots of content can be used as guild content. They could even have festival missions during festivals using the festival races, and add a new upgrade to unlock expansion mission slots and use adventures in expansions.
---
For example, if each race got an adventure version, guild missions could require earning a certain number of points under a certain time limit, and give points based on adventure completion. For example:
---
* Bronze: 1 point
---
* Silver: 2 points.
---
* Gold: 5 points.
---
* Easy mission: 30 points in 20 minutes.
---
* Medium mission: 30 points in 15 minutes.
---
* Hard mission: 30 points in 10 minutes.
---
Feelsbad when Boon Chrono, pChrono, and Mirage are all extremely meta.
---
oh i see. is there a way to get more shared slot than 2 ?
---
Note that some graphics settings work only with i7 or better.
---
it's a TFS joke.
---
You can buy more in the gemstore.
---
You'll have to buy them from the gem store. They go on special a couple times a year.
---
That's a weird way to spell [beta login screen music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erd6_U5QIvQ) but I agree.
---
True
---
Yep, and both words share the same root.
---
Arcdps extras can hide several elements, but not the minimap unfortunately.
---
Doing the easier LW map dailies is also an easy way to get Karma, in addition to the suggestions that have already been given.
---
THE TIME WIZARD
---
Thanks, I'm in the process of doing that.
---
Savage
---
the magical hook of scritches
---
I might be missing something, but Rebooting IG-6417 is not a requirement for Vision, it's the Bandolier.
---
As the other responder said, people are at different points in the game.  
---
That said, if you're looking for the most profitable ways to dump your karma, [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/karma) has you covered.
---
&gt; Would any of you happen to know the server name that are hosted in London or Paris?
---
First and foremost, Worlds are not equal to servers! So you don't have different datacenters with servers for german, french or other languages for the different worlds but it is more likely to have one datacenter that hosts all worlds for one region, EU in this case.
---
That means, there is no world you can select that is hosted near London or Paris! Worlds are hosted on a megaserver system in which map instances are created depending on the number of players on it. This applies to each region which means that you can play with german, french and Spanish players at the same time on the same map. The only difference the world makes is in WvW because only there is a separation.
---
Which means, you choose a World for WvW rather anything else really.
---
ye its not the equipment one (Bandolier), its part of completing the meta achievement which gives you the Olmakhan Mantle, which is needed for Visions of Sandswept Isles.
---
&gt; Just imagine that someone would craft single item of some skin, unlocked it, then sold to another guy, that would unlock it and resell to another guy. This can go infinitively long, so in reality you used materials for one weapon and everyone unlocked it. 
---
Uh, that's not what it means at all. If you were to permanently unlock a skin, it would become account/character bound - Just like how it already works in the game.
---
&gt;Actually having stuff to be account bound once you want to use it for yourself means that economy is healthy - there is stil ldemand for all the various stuff.
---
If everything in the game was neither account nor character bound, then the only change the economy sees is an influx of way too much supply of bloodstone dust and similiar, which would be sold for dirt cheap. Existing materials or upper end items, such as previously bound legendaries or gifts, would just see a price that would already match the time investment. The materials for those are *not generated out of thin air* just because you can go the Gems -&gt; Gold route. They would still have to be aquired in the first place by someone and therefore the price would be set quite high. [That proposed idea is actually what it would make a healthy economy](https://medium.com/kinblog/defining-a-healthy-economy-2b398c5451af). 
---
&gt;We actually have quite a bunch of items and materials that have too low demand. For example some recipes are just worthless, everyone have them and you cna get them for 2 copper...pretty much pointless state of economy for those items. 
---
That's not an issue that exists because they are not account bound. That's because they lack a broader purpose. You can't open up a store and sell goods that have no purpose and then blame the "economy". Supply and demand.
---
&gt;So I would say that you don't really know much about the economy, how it works. Your proposal would make the economy dead in a week.
---
Take economics 101. It would actually cause market growth, without substantial inflation.
---
Person A sells X (previously bound) -&gt; Buys Y -&gt; Person B gains wealth to buy X.
---
Another example would be a healthy market:
---
Person A spends time to receive Gift X -&gt; Sells X for currency that is worth the time he spent on getting it.
---
The way it currently works is that you get nothing of value out of the time you have spent, which is pretty toxic in economics. I don't even care about OP's idea, but I just wanted to tell you that your concept of "muh healthy economy" is false.
---
Hello Everyone,
---
I'm trying to finish up Core Tyria Masteries, I think I've got 4 or 5 Mastery Points to go.
---
I picked the Karka Hatchlings Achievement in Lion's Arch as one of the points that seemed not so difficult to get. Except for the stupid one above the Door Arch by the NPC that gives you the riffle.
---
I've been looking for guides and it was narrowed down to either spending time there shooting at a corner and Pray to RNGesus, no success after I've spent a good 2 hours trying to do it. The other one is using part of the Troll's Revenge JP and a Mesmer Portal to reach the roof.
---
I thought there might be another way to do it using the Springer Mount to reach the arch and shoot the Hatchling point blank.
---
Is this last option viable?
---
This is a good example, because Atlantica has a also sells mounts and decorations, which players also buy, partially for stats, but often to show "look I have the latest and coolest mount or decoration".
---
You could buy and use such an item, or even add it to your collection and get collection points for it. You could also resell it after you were done with it; in which case, it didn't stay unlocked for you.
---
The stats and collection points give people reason to buy and keep mounts and decos.
---
Yes, but even the meta achievement for the chapter doesn't require the backpack collection, you have plenty of other options so you can pick and choose which ones you want to do.
---
no problem, another one I remembered, it's not strictly a timegate but for Vision you need to craft 6 Dragonsblood which need [Exquisite Serpentite Jewels](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exquisite_Serpentite_Jewel) and those are limited per day
---
Sure, as you can see in my OP, I agree that character bound is even worse. My argument is that the economy could be even more open.
---
Aren't you just stereotyping me by the way the sockpuppets type? A bit of hypocrisy,is it? Also nah,only account i ever had,free to believe otherwise. There is a reason i m only replying every 10 minutes.
---
Its frost burn
---
VB is one of the best maps they've ever made, imo. It has incredible layering and environmental design, it perfectly showcases the metroidvania concept of masteries, it's beautiful looking, it's lethal, the rewards are great, and it has some of the best events/event chains stories in the game.
---
Shame you can't have more than ome slot. 
---
I dont want to give up my glyph of bounty. I would like to run both though.
---
I’d have gotten it if it were part of a set. I hate the one-off gathering tools, because I like having everything match.
---
Jahai Bluff incursions are also really good because you can easily put up a mentor tag and people will flock to the giant purple bubble due to high visibility. 
---
The initial waves of enemies are great with the karmic bonus.
---
[insert innuendo]
---
Teq is worth doing for the 2g as well
---
I think I agree with most people here in that, experiencing everything the way it was intended the first time through is always nice.  I've always seen mounts as a nice QoL feature for alts / reward for making my way through the game.  
---
That said, if you don't care about the story at all, getting at least the Raptor and Springer mounts makes moving through HoT maps so much more convenient.
---
No, only for gathering tools.
---
This is correct, you can put the glyph in any tool (that can have glyphs) at any time for free.
---
Well really, it's just "there's some trouble going on over in the new expansion area, I'll let you use my airship to get there" and then when you get there it's "oh shit the trouble's worse than we thought" and the emissary of the Main Antagonist is like "I'm the emissary of the Main Antagonist! Submit to their power or die! Now I'm going to show how powerful I am by attacking this village!" and you get your raptor after dealing with the attack.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Nothing you wouldn't have already expected from an MMO story.
---
I had reaps of karma and then at some point I decided I needed all the cultural weapons for skin unlocks. And then I thought it was a cool idea to buy all the LS minis. And then there was Aurora.
---
I'm scraping whatever karma I can find now just to get by with new legendary trinket collections...
---
*dah ya death, capn jahk sparra?*
---
Why? Gw2 has no subscription fee, and even f2p players unlock the newest LS episode simply by logging in. It's also possible to convert gold to gems. I'm all for offering "complete LS" packs at a reduced price, but I see no reason why it should be free.
---
Yay thanks! Will try! So what does make something a legit jumping puzzle? The reward at the end or the fact it is officially listed online as such?
---
Thank you!! I will stick to no mounts for now and will see :)
---
Aww thanks :D some mentioned there were HoT spoilers so I was afraid of those
---
I was tempted for this tool but does it not have limited uses? Clumped up nodes are not very common, besides the "farm" patches and the pile of trees in Malchor's Leap those are the only ones that come to mind..
---
&gt;It's the charged quartz that I find most objectionable. If you don't have the gold and don't have any charged quartz, that is 22 days minimum.
---
Yeah, I was very lucky in that regard, I had a friend with piles of the stuff who also had the crafting skill to make the lamp and did so for me for just the other resources. Probably a massive timesaver.
---
Ok, but now do it all again with the genders reversed.
---
Mesmer
---
I feel like your friend needs a bit of humbling =)
---
Not sure if troll or actually dumb.
---
You know what’s worse than this? shooshadoo with a sigil of fire
---
Each "real" jumping puzzle has an achievement that you get when you first complete it. I think that's also where we got the names from. The ones for the core game are under General -&gt; Explorer in your achievement tab.
---
For the actual content, there often isn't a clear distinction between what's a jumping puzzle and what isn't. Some of the real jumping puzzles feel more like mini-dungeons and sometimes you find a series of jumps that's really well implemented and leads to a chest or vista but that doesn't count as a real jumping puzzle.
---
No, that map has been there for a year and you don’t have to get your rewards in a day. A legendary requires a grind so tailor your expectations to such.
---
Yeah I think there's no great solution. Because I could say oh just set it so that ascended isn't a thing and reduce the drop rate for exotics so that players are running around in rare gear and have to craft exotics for the most part, but I don't know how fun that would be. On paper it should be just as fun as now only with less power creep and one less tier of gear. But idk.
---
I was never able to solo WvW tower champs until I took "shield master" in defense. Equip a mace and shield and switch to it whenever the breakbar is up and when you're low on health.
---
I personally don't like the perma-dodging builds that rely on might for healing.
---
1. Yes.
---
2. Depends on your build.
---
3. Elementalist in general is really squishy.
---
So I'm assuming u have 0 wvw experience, you want to get the warclaw for skin, fyi it's only good to use in wvw and sucks bad in pve as it doesnt have the skills that are available on wvw, and it has the slowest land mount speed to boot, not to mention it lacks good mount skins, no 2k gem skin, and forces you to buy a 2k bundle for 5 skins even if you only want 1 of the skins, no 400 gem per skin offer.
---
thats so creepy :D :D
---
&gt;Why is there a big influx of people coming back to it, or people willing to start playing after such a long time?
---
I'm pretty curious too. Just like you I haven't played since release and just returned a few weeks ago. Started from scratch and got myself a new level 80 ranger to play with and currently going through the expansion.
---
Did we all just saw a GW2 ad or something and it made us return? Funny thing is I haven't played an MMO since WoW Legion expac due to an ever busy irl schedule. I decided to get back into GW2 because I miss the MMO scene and knew GW2 is pretty damn casual friendly with no gear treadmill.
---
what makes you think there is a patch today?
---
Yeah I've been spamming it lately to fill in the last sets of alternate armor for my characters that still need them and I'll probably sick up on boxes of it so I can get any juicy new stat sets as they come out.
---
I don't think we're getting the skins today.
---
That being said, the skins I would love to see eventually;
---
* [Dreadnaught](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dreadnought_Raptor_Skin)/Armored Skyscale
---
* [Hydra](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hydra) Skyscale
---
* [Crystallized/Concept Art](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/16/Skyscale_Concept_Art_3.jpg) Skyscale
---
* [Rotscale](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Rotscale) Skyscale
---
Oh what are gem cards??
---
Today start the meta events week
---
I hope we'll get a set of 5 skins like with the warclaw, one of them being a branded skin (the concept art they showed on stream).
---
The stats on efficiency seem good so far: the warclaw has been around about 4 times as long as the skyscale (3 months vs. 3 weeks) but there are only about 3 times as many warclaws as there are skyscales (48.5k vs 15.7k).
---
Ele is one of the easiest and fun classes to level with.
---
4. I like tempest more, still my most played alt, even tho i have not logged it in about year.
---
Yes you *can* show up whenever, and get steamrolled by the enemy commander 
---
*thats* rubbish advice, go around 5 before reset at 7, that's when the most people will be there and you can actually stand a chance instead of going in solo and running around dying to the death blob
---
&gt; I, as a reasonable GW2 creature, still welcome your opinon on the matter ^.^=
---
Reddit: fuck your opinion and fuck you for having it.
---
An Axe of Ice and Fire
---
that's what I said
---
Id love to see a bone dragon skyscale skin. It would be a missed opportunity if they didnt.
---
idk if your friend played with a gamepad, but it's actually possible and very enjoyable to play GW2 like an console actionRPG.[I once wrote a pretty lengthy guide to achieve this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/708eoz/how_to_play_gw2_with_gamepad_do_you_want_a_guide/dn35vgy/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_crankpatate).
---
Besides this, gw2 has a very fast paced combat system with loads of inputs, active defenses and a lot of status effects, to watch out on as well. The biggest difference to normal action Combat is, instead of combo attacks you have cooldowns on abillities in GW2. Sounds bad at first, but actually with this system you can do your own combos with no bound rotation of moves at all. GW2 combat is actually more complex and allows more freedom than normal action combat.
---
BUT.... when you start lvl1 you won't see this. GW2 starts extremely slow. Painfully slow. Also: open world PvE is very easy most of the time. You can technically ignore all the cool "active defenses" and "do your own combos" and just do a bunch of DPS and win anyway. (up to HoT expansion)
---
The combat system shines best in PvP. But PvP is very hard to get into, when you start from 0. Idk if it's enough for your friend to know, that GW2 combat is mindblowing awesome, but also too complex to just grasp in 1 hour.
---
\------------------
---
If your friend doesn't like cooldowns on skills: Start as a thief. This guy basically has "mana" to use his special abillities, but no cooldowns on them. Just beware, thief isn't the best starter class for noobs. Can lead to a lot of frustration.
---
Everything you don't plan to immediately use goes to bank. I only carry additional set of weapons/gear with different stats, food/pots and maybe couple of boosters with me if I farm. Maybe something like meteor scanner, too.
---
Resources go to materials.
---
If you buy three shared slots and keep unid gear in there, it stacks there neatly from every character you play on and you can unload it in your bank once they reach full stack size. When you have couple dosen stacks, take a character to vinewrath with all of them, get mf boost with whatever else you can find, and open them+salvage.
---
If you don't have enough place in a bank, make an alt, equip 20slot bags and transfer rarely used things on him. Like, boosters you might need so they stay in a bank, recipes - you need once in a blue moon, they go to storage alt. Dragonite, Dust, Empyreal - make an eater item for them, and after you crafted some backup amount of empyreal stars etc (I usually keep 50 of each just in case, but that's really too much) use eaters to transform the excess to at least something vaguely useful.
---
that doesn't mean anything. events like these can simply be enabled server-side. additionally content/release patches happen at least 2 weeks apart, and we only had one 7 days ago. anet also wouldn't have pushed a seperate build for the quite tame hot fixes they applied last night, and instead would have bundled them into the main patch bound to release a day later. and lastly there is the datamining based prediction by shaman.
---
Shhh it's Huawei p30 ofc lol
---
I can't help but agree with this. I think that before Istan was nerfed into the ground this achieve would've been more reasonable but as it stands now the severe restrictions on looting have made farming for 3000 kralkite and Rose quartz so painful to do. I hope anet sees this and considers going back on some of the nerfs, because when you look at the state of Dragonfall right now they seem excessive and unnecessary.
---
Does this work in wvw on all the nodes or does it only go like only the berry nodes around 900 units? or berry node wood node and leather node at same time?
---
skyscale unlocks are still below 7%. at this rate i wouldn't be surprised if they hold the skins back even longer.
---
If I cba swapping glyphs around, what's better to use overall for mining, chopping and gathering? Atm I use glyph of industry on all my tools. And I use consortium for gathering.
---
screenshake monkaSHAKE
---
Don't get it
---
I came back after five years away and bought both expansions.  I knew I wanted the raptor to help with leveling up, but didn't want story spoilers.  I turned off the volume and actually looked away when there was any dialog.  I got the raptor and I have no idea what was going on with the story.  I killed something, I ran around, I got the raptor.  You're safe to get it.  
---
Honestly, I did a hero point train through HoT with a boosted thief to get an elite class before doing the story with him and I \*still\* don't know what's going on there.  If you skip cutscenes and ignore dialog it's hard to spoil anything.  
---
I did quit the thief in order to level through the story from level 1 with a ranger, and it's much more fun that way (and with the raptor).
---
One of the few tools I was/am still tempted to buy multiples of.  So far, doing only plant one.  I knew it would be awesome for home instance but also I would also my other bonuses from other glyphs.  So a good compromise was for plants and keep bonuses on other 2.  Still tempted though.
---
Plant one is so nice for guild hall.
---
It took me about 4-5 days to get my account recovery through.
---
This was about a week ago, so it should be fairly representative for how it is at the moment.
---
My opinion for best experience:  Verdant Brink and Auric Basin on foot/glider.  Get a feel for the jungle.
---
Then say aloud, "FUCK Tangled Depths."  Unlock Raptor Level 3 and Springer Level 3.  Go back to Heart of Thorns and enjoy yourself.

I've just been crashing repeatedly lately with the generic add-on bug.  I use radial mounts as d3d9_chainload.dll and was considering just removing everything altogether so that I had a control.  I crashed 2-3 times raiding this past weekend, and I really hope that I won't have to remove all my add-ons to continue using Arc.  Radial mounts is just too good to pass up.
---
Anet is gonna sell you a 2k gemstore skin that unlocks a collection with a 7 day time-gate.
---
I may be wrong, but I think the joke is about the debris looking like a crashed elder dragon (and matching the mount color theme).

I think what they're showing is the staging area (outpost) that you start the GW1 mission from.
---
Same day as nintendo e3. Cool.
---
Wha-
---
The Guardian Lion-dog would be a must-buy for me, to complement the Shrine Guardian Jackal skin so I can carry a Canthan aesthetic across all modes of play!
---
i thought you could pick Vipers from bladed armor for a while now
---
I love the stream of content / information updates we’ve been having this year!
---
Whether you wait for new chips or not, [Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for running GW2.  New chips should populate that list shortly after they launch.
---
Inb4 this still doesn't finish Coalescence.
---
Raid rewards from open world. Oh boy.
---
&gt;baby Aurene appearing as a vision
---
oh so if i finish story S3E2 i do any map completition renown hearts of any map i get this obscure baby aurene cutscene or interaction :O?
---
They released Warclaw skins only, what, a week after that went live?
---
With the collection timegating reduced drastically, they might try to drum up interest in the mount by putting out skins 3 weeks after it's come out. How long are they going to hold off, realistically? Until 25% have unlocked them? Tons of people still don't even have Griffon and I've lost count of how many skins it has by this point.
---
Thunderhead would like to have a word with you
---
Cool can't wait to not play it
---
YES! Now time to farm for vision AND new ring....yay.......double the farm.......(crying)
---
So we have a special community progressed event week starting today, and right after that another special one? I'm loving this.
---
Yeah, I used to go on gifting sprees back when I played. I abruptly stopped when the same guys I gifted gold, precursors etc came back begging for more then starting to call me names when I told them no.
---
That was the nerf a few months back, making the chests from Great Hall and Palawadan only appear once per day per account.  I believe the number of champs at the Great Hall was also reduced, because champ bags still drop freely in both events, of course.
---
Really hyped for the raid itself! I'm hoping the rewards you get via the open world event are not the only raid rewards though, but rather a different set also available through the raid.
---
Something something hope it lasts us a year.
---
Memes aside,  looking forward to new challenges!
---
Qadim has absolutely fabulous hands.
---
hmmm, I'm not 100% sure about this. You'd think the logical progression, if anything, would be that maybe the "base" version of the weapons are temporarily available from open world, but the "extra shiny" upgraded versions require raiding... then again, that might actually be the case, it doesn't necessarily contradict what they've said in this release, exactly.
---
NO!
---
New raid HYPE
---
Same. I have a decent computer, unless I'm standing in a clump of people during a world boss, I'm generally at 55+ fps. Dragonfall map, without meta going on I'm usually at around 15. With meta,  &lt;10. That teleports that happen lock up my computer for several seconds and occasionally crash the game altogether. Istan meta also causes some computer crankiness, but nothing to this degree.
---
I just gave up and went back to farming Silverwastes.
---
&gt;the Key of Ahdashim
---
&gt;Let’s Get Shiny
---
In Guild Wars 1 there's a quest in Ahdashim involving a baby dragon named Shiny. These two facts make me very suspicious. Might just be a Skritt reference though.
---
I like both male and female sylvari PC, Logan, Canach, Tybalt, Rox, Sayeh Al Rahjid.
---
I don't like Glint, Caith and human female pc :(
---
Thx!
---
Goren was a sweetheart. Learning more about what happened to him would be great.
---
New wing hype! First time being present at a new wing release!
---
I'm sure he would get along with all those Skritt just fine.
---
That glider skin tho... I might have squee'd a little.
---
I am, for one, happy with this. I no longer have interest in raids, neither the time, so even a limited shot at raid rewards sounds good.
---
I set mine on Medium so I never have to adjust it
---
Yeah, not sure why they added the headpiece. The outfit ears had face paint (which was fine, if you didn't like the paint you could have dyed it to closely match skin tone and obscure it almost entirely.) And it's not like there was precedent to add anything new, the Braham Wolfblood Pauldrons or w/e they're named didn't add anything new when they were split from the outfit, so why the medallion thing here?
---
No matter, just need to find a hairstyle to obscure both my character's base ears *and* that medallion. Should be *super* simple. /s (still buying it though, I'll make it work somehow)
---
14 seconds into the fight. Time to precast axe 2.
---
Hence
---
&gt; Silly me

---
which legendary is that?
---
Returning player from a quick break right after Qadim was released. What's the current status of ranger/druid? I tried druid last night and was pretty confused with the changes to the spirits (activating the skill again re-summons to my location?!).
---
Is druid still meta in CMs and double druid meta in raids? If not, what got nerfed? what replaces druid?
---
It seems pSB is pretty good right now, is cSB still relevant at all?
---
This looks pretty exciting. The design of Qadim (corrupted?) seems awesome and the mix of a hidden city and branded should be interesting if this is set after Kralk died.
---
Dye Kits? RIP Belgium
---
Not very epic, this is not the trailer quality we got to see lately.
---
Ooo, I’m buying those ears. Didn’t want entire outfit for them
---
[I am still waiting for your response.](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bugna6/season_5_speculation_content_normally_exclusive/epcu6j2/)
---
&gt; Yeah, not sure why they added the headpiece.
---
"Surely no one would want to buy animal ears without jewelry, would they?"
---
My Fate Apocrypha Atalanta cosplay weeps

I actually just got that from an unlocker and I was thrilled. After the last couple unlockers got me CoE dungeon armor skins, this was a nice bit of value.

&gt; From June 11 to June 25, defeat these powerful enemies to mine colorful  crystal essence. Bring essences to skritt near the Mystic Forge to  create shiny weapons

---
.....I need to start raiding.....but without a good guild for that....My guild is basically dead

30% of this trailer is a boss belly dancing I can’t x)
---
make sure to get a progression team for release night; the most fun raid experience one can have!
---
About time we get some Cantha hints
---
Templates are acting wacky too, doesn't load half of the loadout
---
That's amazing and I envy you a bit. Congrats!!
---
You know what my menagerie needs? A water djinn.
---
Well.... You still can damage, you don't need to run RIGHT after you got it. And he was low on hp, most likely he was waiting for heal
---
Is there a way to make hafez's music box tradeable? I was kind of absent-mindedly opening containers but apparently this is worth a lot of money and I don't have any use for it except taking up inventory space.
---
Or you just need to farm the events like mad and get all the weapons before they leave. You have two weeks ;)
---
In before it ends up that this is just because we fight a giant singing crab in Ahdashim.
---
Yea and dont forget to watch this
---
https://youtu.be/pDSJwE7d9us
---
Are you being serious?
---
Are we sure it’s a raid reward and not just an extra event that will be exclusive to The new raid once it’s over?
---
This looks pretty plane... only one new model (Qadim), lots of branded we have been figthing for so long now. No voice acting, no hype :/ I guess I got used to great trailers for other stuff.
---
Oh well let's hope the raid itself and CMs are great.
---
Yeah any expansion specific map tends to be way harder to run than core tyria ones. Plus everyone's PCs are different. I always expect low frame rates but I'm baffled by how extreme it is in Dragonfall compared to every other map. Even Istan and guild halls :0
---
Good, twice the actions, double the ban
---
I think it's dumb as fuck that ANet is letting what should be Raid exclusive skins available to be unlocked via open world. Why not let us unlock exclusive PvP/WvW skins that way then? If you aren't able to raid and earn the skins yourself, you shouldn't be able to earn them in an easier way than normal.
---
Yes! To me it looks adorable.
---
Believe it or not there's more to this game than open world. I enjoy instanced content such as Fractals, Raids, Dungeons, things where I'm able to min-max with friends/gear, etc to speed up our times. There's people who enjoy the WvW/GvG aspect of Gw2 and rarely step foot into open world, same with PvP. Gw2's combat system is what drew me to the game, not the open world.
---
I have a Ranger with a red aesthetic and some hints of green, and black leather. If I can get Abyssal Forest, I'm planning on replacing the Glossy Black leather with it as it has more depth and plays into the hints of green.
---
If I don't unlock it, no real sweat, but it looks better than the grey-black to me and plays up the forest outfit for her
---
&gt;consult with the skritt to learn how you can make your shiny weapons *even shinier*.
---
Maybe they learn that they have to do the raid?
---
Just got one! on my 3rd opening.
---
To sell or to use. If it was red/blue i'd probably use.
---
First of all you can do WvW at any point during the day and night. You do not have to have a tag for that. If there is one and you want to run with it go for it. But telling there is only WvW at reset i again rubbish. 
---
WvW can be played in so many ways. You can go with a zerg, a guild, a group, or alone. You can play on the map without being in a group but cominucate with the other on the map were enemy movements are and were you or others need people. 
---
You can defend your border or attack the enmy border. You can do it alone or together with a group, a guild, a zerg or a blob. Just adjust to what you are capable of doing. If you are 1 person you don't go for a blob. If you are a blob you don't hunt a group of 1 unless they are trying to take something from you.
---
Or you go alone on the map and take/take back camps, sentries, ruins, shrines even towers or just walk a dolly. If there is something that is to much use map chat. 
---
So yeah telling people here that you can only do wvw at reset is rubbish, there is a lot to do outside you just need to adjust to it.
---
the wording could mean the base versions are open world available, while they shinier versions are raid only. hard to tell, but if that was the case I'd think it's fine. otherwise it would be kinda strange - because then, what's next, pile of gold chair from golden ooze in auric basin?
---
&gt;Fixed a bug that could cause the Junundu Rising meta-event in the Desolation to stall.
---
Uh...did anyone look at the Maws of Torment stall bug?  Bueller?
---
My bf bought me a pack of 25 and no luck ^.^'
---
So if you end up listing it, I might be your buyer! lol
---
I listed it for 545g. Hoping price falls as people unbox more and I can collect on this one.
---
If you joined for the combat system, why not play a game with better Combat/dungeons/raids like Tera? The main draw of GW2 is the open world.
---
&gt; Not sure what it even is, but try unchecking every box under Area Stats [+]
---
nothing is checked. 
---
&gt;Even though it doesn't work for me personally (or maybe it's not meant for this at all)
---
thanks, tried this, also doesnt make it work. i do chainload hook so that is definitely why its borked. 
---
tried to make the box come up again to see if i can get a screenshot, and its not doing it now. i guess bringing up area stats just to check that theyre unticked registered them as unticked? who knows lol
---
I'm sure there will be lot of them on the LFG. Wait, what's... "CoZ/VitV + 1000LI/200LD only"?
---
(And I bitterly say that as someone who meets those requirements. It certainly wouldn't kill people to be a bit more rookie friendly ont he first weeks when we're all greens)
---
I want a winged unicorn that farts rainbows when you do the barrel roll speed boost thing.
---
I think it a title like Harbinger or Herald would fit better, gods are kind of a human and grawl thing.
---
Test its karma version, it's fucking OP.
---
Move your body, Qadim, uh uh uh uh
---
Looks like he was turning away from Matthias to go drop the poison when the ghost rendered. It's tough to judge a few sec gif so don't be a dick.
---
I personally feel that most of them are fluff, like collecting 10 magic orbs or collecting a peach, and the rest are ignorable. I think that reducing the number of them needed per day for a big reward that would be equivalent to doing a bunch of small ones for 1 map material each (the current system) would encourage players to engage in the content, rather than run from Bloodstone Fen to Dragonfall doing all the 1 minute objectives.
---
This is just my opinion and you are allowed to enjoy and prefer the current system as is.
---
Inquest in either Kourna or Sandswept Isles with the Karmic Retribution buff.  Here's why: They also drop valuable loot, including t5/t6 totems and bags, as well as giving volatile magic per kill.  So you're farming karma, coin, and volatile magic.  Win win win.
---
It's per tool. So if it's gatherable with a sickle, it hits everything. Same with axe and pickaxe.
---
if u only want the mount, dont even begin
---
Nearly all my friends play Gw2, and I enjoy their company enough to stick around and play a game that otherwise hasn't done shit for me content wise.
---
It's only good in an unlimited glyph imo. Otherwise the charges on the tool get used up with each node gathered from, making you use it up really fast.
---
What a sad commentary on their priorities. They should treat all of their content as important and worth being proud of and hyping not just the 1 hour living story episodes.
---
&gt; but if we're being real here this is the last raid wing being released for gw2
---
Source?
---
If only there would be good way to actually let them learn about raids ingame...nowadays it all stands on external resources or gtfo, which is not enough.
---
(ʘ‿ʘ✿)
---
Yeah I guess I should have considered with the demand it'd be listed high huh? Haha...ha...
---
Depends on your preferences. There's a flax farm I do every day with all my alts, and instead of gathering all of them one by one in a circle, I swing my gathering tool twice and am done.
---
It's stupidly OP in my book.
---
&gt; this is the last raid wing being released for gw2
---
What makes you say that?
---
It is a big deal because Asura and Charr get the worse as they very often do. We have got used to it when it comes to armor. Asura and Charr but weapons should not differ at all. In size sure if this is a must because asura can obviously not carry a weapon which are like 3 times their size (or similair but i think you get my point), but weapons do not need to be remade as a whole but rezised. Which is very different and why i have a hard time imagien what the reason for this left out could even be.
---
But if they are available outside of the raid they are by the very definition not raid exclusive.. so what is the issue?
---
This is the real reason why they did not wanted to release it with last chapter of LS, and in my eyes pretty decent one.
---
It also means that tired raiders can go chill on worldbosses as well, it is not only for non-raiders :)
---
Guilds are a thing in this game?
---
Holy crap! What is that song?! 
---
It's intoxicating.
---
That's why they added one more for all other races and charr even get another one for the tail.
---
Maybe Norn would need a seventh one too?
---
Btw, there two different team who works on legendary trinkets. Raid team is making their own legendary and LWS team their own
---
Feels like playing Legion again.
---
i have just as much information as anyone else, which is nothing. at least with the release of Mythwright Gambit there was dev confirmation that W7 was in the works. there is currently nothing stated that more raids are in development
---
i would love to be proven incorrect with my previous statement, but i just haven't been
---
I think you are missing the point here. Berry, herb, leather, cloth and vegetables are the same thing and will all be gathered with your harvesting tool. Often there is at least 2 of the harvesting nodes sometimes as many as 4. Which means you gather them all at once. 
---
Works exactly like in the guild hall were you also gather all the harvesting nodes at once (if you have the reaper glyph on)
---
I booly è_é
---
Jesus, the details on some of these models that you can miss even after years. I had no idea branded earth elementals had that creepy face you can see at 0:35. I always thought they just had a rocky crystal front to them.
---
implying that the past 3 LW trailers weren't amazing.
---
It also gives steady stream of what to do, directly fighting the people with behaviour "rush all new stuff at day 1, then complain there is nothing to do and then logout for 3 months"
---
They already are doing it for like a year, basically since summer festival there was big patch every 2-3 weeks, be it tonics into wardrobe, festivals, or other updates....ye, many of those did not added so much content, but the game was actually pretty much moving forward in a feelable way.
---
I believe WvW/PvP stuff will get promoted once there is nothing else on table :) 2vs2 tournament was great, I hope we will get it again soon.
---
I farm my diamond chest every week on YB and with each passing week the turn out and frustration due to low population gets worse and worse and people tend to snap at each other because there just aren't enough people to sustain throughout the entire day unless it's a weekend. Take yesterday for example: all of ebg was owned by NSP and people kept trying to get ebg back when we were losing tier 3 hills and almost tier 3 keep on borderlands. NSP was camping it pretty hard with a small handful of people who knew what they were doing vs what seemed like some mindless pugs that needed to be elsewhere at the time. Unfortunately I transferred here from SOS hoping to find an easier time with roaming and that was one hell of a mistake I made months ago. YB needs to become a link server with how bad it's doing during the day. It is fairly good during NA prime time though, but only for a few hours and then it's outnumbered all night and half of the day until prime time again. Then you have the toxic people we're up against who have the gall to talk shit when we have no people and no options but to gank and work together in small pug groups that usually fail lol.
---
They meant limited use as in nodes aren't always close enough together for it to gather from ore than one node, not limited in the amount of times it could be used.
---
Didn't have time to make one for each race but I will definitely consider that for next time
---
Welp, at least FFXIV ACTUALLY enjoyable after story. In GW2 after you finish the story...well...6 raids is boring after you done them like 75 times now. And FFXIV actually release raids more or less.. Twice as often as GW2? Yes, there mostly no story and just boss to kill, but it still something to do
---
It's very likely AMD has the top end locked down. What we haven't seen yet is how the mid/high end parts behave under sustained loads. It's possible that a 3700X will lose out to a similarly priced Intel part at stock simply because it's configured for a 65W TDP, whereas Intel's 8-cores are configured for 125+.
---
That one was amazing, wasn't it? /s
---
But I had W6 and trailers for living world in mind :)
---
&gt;with the majority of the raid team being laid off
---
Hm? I seem to recall that the majority of the big names from the raid (and fractal) team were still there after the lay-offs? Maybe I remember it incorrectly?
---
Depends on the situation. Currently, GW2 is getting new raids (the interval is huge, but still). Until they announce cancellation of raid development, it's fair to assume more will come.
---
But...we do have FotM...
---
From their daddy hahaha
---
I never raid with any of my guilds. Find groups in LFG and if you like them enough, let em know you'd like to raid with them more and add the people you wanna join again. Sooner or later they'll invite you again when they need people and you'll have a whole friend's list of people you can invite whenever you want to raid!
---
&gt; So in what world is it the logical way to assume that there will be no more raid releases?
---
I didn't say that, don't put words in my mouth. I said it's backwards to think that a lack of evidence that raids will stop is the same as evidence that raids will continue.
---
&gt;By using that logic we can surely also assume that there will never be any more new open world releases. Or any more new drops? Nor will there ever be any new bosses or mobs?
---
oh are you for real?
---
i didn't think the collection weapons were soulbound.
---
Solution: be the chrono or get a chrono friend.  These aren’t unsolvable problems.
---
Nah you're right. If you have that attitude, we don't want you to raid. It's okay to be a little optimistic in life sometimes you know.
---
&gt; ...mistborn mote farming being unnecessarily difficult.
---
Do events to get keys. During that time hit any motes you see around and dont be afraid to wp between the 3 zones or beetle between them during the set up phase to get the extra chests. Otherwise its just farm events for keys, do the meta and the ley infused champs at the end and boom 50-100 motes per meta. Keep an eye out for certain events like the beginning escorts to set up the camps there are 3 chests at each one and you can often hit more than one camp, then there are the events to go kill the menders that start at T3 I think and those are another 3 chests and you can sometimes hit more than one of those. The chest or mistborn coffers always drop 1 mote with a rare chance for 5 or 30 bonus motes.
---
Not even remotely close outside the blue color
---
Erm.. No? At least 3 (Ben is one of them) of the fractal\raid team was laid off and we do know, that they are small to begin with. Hell, that's why they merged fractal and raid team in the first place
---
[The Ascension](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ascension) (PvP leg backpack) requires a **minimum of 60 days** playing 3 rankeds a day. There are 4 phases, you go from phase 1 to phase 2 when you complete a certain set of achievements, that always include a "play 3 rankeds for 15 days" achievement. This means that, not only you have to play like 30 min for 60 days, you should have completed all the other achievements (win x rankeds with x class and things like that) in one phase before you reach the day 15, or you will be stuck in that phase and not advancing with the time-gate. It happened to me in the 3rd phase and took me a few extra days as I was completely burnt out. That's probably the most annoying time-gate in GW2, besides legendary armor sets.
---
Also, there are several armor/weapon sets exclusive to pvp/wvw reward tracks. If he's interested in wardrobe completionism, he should get those tracks first. And if he's having any sort of "downtime", he should go to wvw to pip and start hoarding [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Skirmish_Claim_Ticket) tickets because you can only get a set amount of them each week (same as raid li's and magnetite shards btw; also each pvp season ranked gives a limited amount of [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_League_Ticket)), and you need a -lot- if you want to get all the rewards. High ranks pip faster, so ideally you want to farm as much wxp as you can. Reaching the weekly cap can go from [40h 20min](https://gw2.limitlessfx.com/wvw/pips.php) to 6h and a half.
---
PD. Don't be an [idiot sandwich](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85g2ttYzgw6o661q/giphy.gif) like me and make sure you only craft **one** gift of skirmishing, the ascension can only be crafted once :&gt;
---
&gt;we don't want you to raid.
---
That's why your community is so small and why it takes 6 months for you to get a new wing lmao. Just not worth supporting, tbh
---
Erm..no. Usually when devs know, that there will be no more development of something they try to evade answering about it, since it will release panic about future of game (raiders usually main income of game, because hi-enders the ones who buy shinnies and.. play the game)
---
That is to say the very first mission when you get to the Crystal Desert. There is one small prelude instance beforehand with Kiel.
---
But why is it backwards? The person I responded to claimed there wouldn't be more raids. He then defended that comment by claiming: We haven't heard about there being more raids, therefore there will be no more raids. 
---
To which I pointed out that it makes no sense to make such an assumptions, since there are no indication whatsoever about it and looking back. If there is no indication of something changing, surely assuming that things is going to continue is the most logical thing to do?
---
get off your high horse, nobody is a dick for asking question
---
Weaver
---
No one stops you from opening your own squad with lower requirements. No one has a clue anyway, so you don't need to know anything about commanding besides the squad composition.
---
No one stops people from opening their own squad with lower requirements. No one has a clue anyway, so they don't need to know anything about commanding besides the squad composition.
---
I have both of those, and skyscale still. I need so many materials.
---
Hmm, fair enough. Seems like I did remember incorrectly. My bad.
---
if you're on NA i'm happy to help you with a training group.
---
Day early what?
---
The exotic version you get at the start is. The ascended version you get at the end obviously is not.
---
You're done in
---
Are you serious?!
---
In PvE DPS is so valuable, because in group content you have support and DPS classes. But if you're solo or or sPvP or in not high end PvE content, you have to be self sufficient. I am not even questioning basic PvE mobs, but at the moment you want to solo a champion or do some group oriented open world contents you have to be self sufficient as heck.
---
Idk where you're comming from, but oh boy are you wrong.
---
GW2 actually haa a very good ballance in this case. You can go full dps build with the expectation of team mates to grant you all the necessary buffs to do that dps or you can lower your max dps and self buff a bit or you can go full bruiser, be self sufficient with the buffs and still deal a lot of dps.
---
That's with most of the classes. If you don't play t4 frac or raid, then go delete these builds from your character. Weaver is so damn powerfull because he has a crap tonn of active defenses and a crap tonn of solo combofield + combo finnisher interactions as well as other interconnectdd combos in their elemental abillities.
---
If you're good you can go for a defensive heal+cleanse rotation to survive or if you're fine you can go for the dps and might stack combo. It's rare to find players focussed on that kind of playstyle that are also able to reach for the limits. That's why this class is always "the weakest" and undereated. Nobody understands why it get a nerf, when it is already "shit". But in truth, the 1% of players, that are REALLY good at it, would wipe other classes and break the system without the nerfs.
---
So was the ending of the personal story. So was the ending of Prophecies. And Factions. And Nightfall. And Eye of the North but none were an end of their game.
---
Who won 1.2bil?
---
Whose ready for two encounters that force either power or condition damage (or heavily biases one particular DPS choice) followed by a final boss encounter where at least one raid member needs to spend time off playing a kiting mini-game?
---
Would be really clever to give more incentives to play Raids and make them more accessible though. Instead Anet just kills another reason to do Raids (exclusive skins).
---
When you make it sound so generic, sure. But "an all out rush across Tyria to find a cure for an incurable disease"? No.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
I agree. Even as a player who keeps up on Living World releases, I never really respect the people who say that they "did everything in an hour" because it's so obvious that they're not engaging with the content at any meaningful level. There's a ton to find in these patches and I doubt I'll ever "catch up" and I've been here since Heart of Thorns.
---
&gt;unbound magic tools since it gathers multiple hits too.
---
What does "gathers multiple hits" mean here? I've got unbound magic tools and the only differences I know of are animation, glyph adding UM to gathering, and of course unlimited use. 
---
I halfway remember something else like maybe there's an extra gather from rich mining nodes (4 vs 3) or something.
---
It's for Vision, the season 4 legendary.
---
I'm actually surprised there's not more posts about it right now
---
War eternal and long live the lich are the only decent ones. But compared to other mmo update trailers there is still a lot to be desired.
---
*shifty eyes*
---
then why setting all the canon lore in jahai/sun's refuge about kralks corruption not being able to penetrate rock formations? ahdashim is hidden in a mountain
---
If you look at the Suns Refuge there is branded crystals so you know theres that.
---
New player here. I bought living world season 4 in order to get sky scale. With the gear stat changes is there a reason for me to purchase living world season 3 from a gear acquisition standpoint?
---
Ok so there's no actual basis for that statement. Cool.
---
You can see the eligible metas cycle on the wiki:
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta-Event\_Rush](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta-Event_Rush)
---
Chances of needing skyscale to complete raid?
---
That's Winter's Presence, and it's not an infusion.
---
They didn't even use a black person this time to advertise the headpiece. A white female in a revealing outfit. How are they going to score points with the regressive left?
---
Not really (I hate the way they look) but I *do* want stat selectable things.
---
you say that, but Noxxi is probably still sobbing quietly in some corner
---
Damn, this will wreck the human female meta
---
Just make sure to fly in spirals from now on.
---
&gt; though they had plans for another Elona and Ascalon arcs for Beyond.
---
which is the same as the plans for season 5. except season 5 is actually happening
---
Alright, I have to ask. What happens to the Charr horns and ears if you put on the shrine guardian ears? Does it clip horribly?
---
I betcha the event gives you access to crafting/buying the exotic versions, and the "even shinier" part refers to the ascended versions which are the raid drops. I don't mind the skins being accessible, I just hope there are things other than weapon skins :P I really liked the White Mantle Portal Device, for example
---
nice
---
I imagine this blurb was written by the genius tease who is Anatoli Ingram, and I love the wordplay in many of his posts. I, too, think (or at least hope) this is some nice foreshadowing of things to come and we'll meet our Shiny friend all grown up sooner rather than later. I'd love to see Shiny being a pampered dragon coating his scales with gold and/or diamonds and having gained some skritt followers who call him "Shiny" all the time with him being irked by it when he thinks they're trying to start a conversation with him only to realize they just keep staring in awe at him Tarir-style.
---
It does make me wonder if Shiny, should he appear in the raid (and I'd be surprised if he doesn't although creating a saltspray dragon for a GW2 reimagining will be interesting to behold), survives to the very end or becomes a victim of Qadim's machinations as he could become a potentially powerful ally if he lives through the events...unless he's sworn to protect the city at all costs or is otherwise accustomed to comfy living and thus won't ever leave it. It would be pretty cool if the raid also retroactively explained why Kralk moved to Vabbi two years before the events of PoF after gaining some Mordy juice; could he have originally sensed the great magic of Ahdashim and Shiny and wished to breach the sanctum before his empowering snack on Balthazar and the new powers that came with it made him abandon these original plans as he left it to his lieutenants to conquer the hidden city?
---
I also find the phrasing "Meet the Key of Ahdashim" curious. In GW1 the Key was [an elemental type of creature guarding the entrance to the hidden city](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Key_of_Ahdashim) who stated that travelers should be worthy enough before entering the city. Given Qadim's ambitions, will the original Key perish and will Shiny take its place as the guardian of the city, or has the transfer of power already taken place, or will we meet the original Key who is unrelated to Shiny?
---
Given some fascinating PoF ambient dialogue in [Destiny's Gorge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Destiny%27s_Gorge#Ambient_dialogue) about the descendants of [Goren](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Goren) (Shiny's first caretaker whom Shiny considered his "mommy" upon hatching), will we meet Shiny's current guardian/aide from Goren's lineage in Ahdashim as well?
---
&gt; **Child:** Hahla's father says that Goren was stronger than our ancestor Koss.  
---
&gt; **Refugee:** And what did I tell you about Hahla's father?
---
&gt; **Child:** (giggle) That he's an idiot.
---
&gt; **Refugee:** Yes, always remember--and this is very important--Hahla's dad is an idiot.
---
This would be a nice way to contrast the upbringing of Aurene, Vlast and Shiny regarding their respective bonding (or lack of at least in the case of Vlast) with mortal races. I could even imagine some comedic dialogue between Goren's descendant (if he or she is, ahem, as special as Goren was) and Shiny depending on if Shiny has become pampered or if he's become less demanding of food since his hatchling years... ;)
---
With that said, though, while I applaud the effort of Sibs and the rest of ANet's marketing and video team with the trailer showing some of the raid wing's pretty locations and enemies as well as that spiffy model for Qadim (and his hypnotic arm movements), the trailer could've shown us a bit more and delivered a bit of a narrative to hype people up. Currently it just shows a bit of the wing's locations (which is nice, though) and random mobs as well as a bit of Qadim but these seem to be random snippets that don't really tell us that much about what the raid's really about or what even is going on unless you already know Qadim beforehand (which random folks interested in GW2 raids stumbling into this video wouldn't although they might think that at least that floating armed guy's model looks cool).
---
The narrative of the trailer wouldn't have needed to be that special and could be done in 1 to 1,5 minutes; it could start with Glenna greeting (with the beckon animation) the raid team running towards her and telling them that bad things are happening in this location and that we need to hurry before things get worse in Vabbi as we zoom towards the city while tension-building music such as ["Forearmed Is Forewarned"](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/forearmed-is-forewarned) (which I think has a nice rhythm and great string work to really build up suspense while still sounding desert-y for the raid's setting) from S4 Episode 3 OST plays in the background. We could then see a shadowy form emerging and hear parts of Qadim's dialogue from Mythwright Gambit about wanting to become the supreme ruler of djinn and wipe off the unworthy races from Tyria and then reveal an additional new line from the new raid about e.g. how the Key of Ahdashim or the knowledge/power within the city will allow him to accomplish his goals now that he knows Vabbi's greatest secret. Qadim could continue his monologue a bit without spoilery stuff while the trailer switches to showing glimpses of some encounters with the team fighting various mobs and maybe even revealing glimpses of the encounter with the first boss of the wing without too much fanfare to let our minds run wild with the footage that is provided. We could then have the current trailer's nice zoom in on Qadim's altered form with those smooth moves as he concludes his threatening monologue about the great power he's about to unleash...except all of a sudden a large, possibly winged shadow of an obscure figure moves in the background and we hear an ominous roar (of the dragon Shiny to get the hype machine going?!) before the footage ends with Qadim's sinister laughter and revealing the name of the raid wing.
---
However, that's just my quick take on it (and my suggestion can definitely be improved as I only listed what I, as just one player, would find interesting in a raid trailer), and I'm grateful to the team that we at least got a trailer rather than just a teaser image to help build up hype for the wing even though I think the narrative of the trailer could use some improvement even within the established limitations (budget, schedule etc). Kudos to Sibs (the head of marketing) and the rest of the team if they happen to read this post; I look forward to hearing more from you fellas and seeing more of your handiwork in the coming months. :)
---
Soulless Horror as well. I've got one raider in my team who usually can't see the first few walls, which makes for some _interesting_ movement decisions when they're trying to tank and have no clue where it's safe to move the stack.
---
Gotta be honest, I don't understand the reference.

You mean, after almost half a year of mostly silence? :P

It comes out free as promotions...
---
Watch advertising partners is your best bet.
---
my original point was NOT JUST that it is conclusive, but that it is rushed. palawa joko was rushed to be only halve a season, maybe because they were uncertain they could do a fifth season.
---
the trinkets I was lookin at. Overnights are really messing with me so I apologize. 
---
As for runes, I already have 3/6 nightmare for the condi.
---
I am currently a Guardian with full exotic Berserker gear.  I am a few episodes into the HoT story and those areas.  I feel super squishy.  I am using the meta from [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter\_-\_Radiant\_Greatsword](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter_-_Radiant_Greatsword) .  Should I mix and match some different gear, or do I just suck?  Doing the story missions I'm just getting destroyed.  I'm literally naked by the end of the story events.
---
What is wrong with encouraging people to play a variety of builds?
---
I laughed at the Tera comment. That is like saying "Oh you like Halo? You should play a better game like Call of Duty!" Just because something is different doesn't mean it is better. Combat in Tera in my opinion is clunky and slow. Guild wars 2 feels more like playing piano to do raid rotations on most classes.
---
huh!  til.
---
I pulled a sneaky on ya
---
In what sense am I being entitled?
---
Thanks for sharing and taking the extra effort to even replicate the music box sound for the keyboard! It's a lovely piece, and you did it justice with your interpretation. :)
---
Easier than one would assume, but also have to keep in mind that it is endgame content and you just cant go in and assume everything to be handed to you.  Get Exotic/ascended gear first, follow some guide about it, read boss mechanic guide and then give it a go. You will wipe couple times but at least you will feel like u earned the kill.
---
What others have said, but the gradient is one of the highest contrasts in game, going from deep black to vibrant green on some armors (e.g. asura light t3 chest piece will have the actual chest be black but the armpiece be bright glowing green. It just creates a lot more variance in armor pieces that didn't have it otherwise
---
Potato , Analysis !
---
OH NOT AGAIN
---
Is the event on? I did great jungle worm and got only the normal rewards. The in game message says it starts today but the news post said next week.  Can anyone confirm?
---
BAHAHAHAHAHAH. 
---
Omg. This might be worth going back for...
---
The [Saltspray style Dragons](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:%22Kuunavang%22_concept_art.jpg) could work too and they'd be a cool skin. It's just I always imagined them more as their own potential mount if we get a Cantha expansion (along with like the [Kirin](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kirin)).
---
Open world vanilla gw2 guardian build is linked to below.  Looks stable and usable to me, armor wouldn't load for me, so  I dont know if the armour is quad stat (expansion related).  I forgot to log in yesterday to remake the build, I'll hopefully remember tonight but no garuntees.

Someone else had mentioned Living Story zones, LS4 Episode 4 is the best one I've found.
---
Buy the first two Karmic Retribution buffs, and you get the third one as a reward from a cheevo in that zone. (I almost never buy the third level as it's really expensive)
---
Do the death-branded shatterer DERV escort pre event and meta and tag as many mobs as possible. 
---
It's super easy to get 40k+ karma per escort/shatterer fight
---
ahh, thank god not for something i'll ever want to make, lol.
---
bolt is difficult enough as it is.
---
Jealous of your slots. What's that item to the left of your boosts?
---
Tbh if you see if not as raid weapons being pushed to the openworld, but the other way around, then I'm pretty happy that I will be able to avoid 1111ing 6 years old bosses and can just use my endless pool of shards to buy the skins.
---
The question is, will there be other, actual raid weapons like in every other wing.
---
In case you missed it, there's a bug with mesmer illusions where if you just have Aurora or Vision equipped, your phantasms have the combined fx as if you had both, while if you have both equipped, your phantasms have a new effect.  It's because of this that people are speculating that the new raid ring is just going to be another reskin of Vision/Aurora.
---
I certainly hope that assumption is wrong, because I feel pretty firmly that the raid ring should be its own unique thing, but the speculation isn't coming from nowhere.
---
Is there any recommendations on which metas to do? I quit as HoT came out and recently came back, so I've only done LS metas (Dragonfall, some of the LS3 ones) and none of the core expacs
---
I did Dopple but there was a straight 20 minute downtime, it was pretty shitty just sitting there waiting
---
why make a trailer at all if it's not exciting and/or intriguing?
---
U will get banned for that. Noone defies god.
---
I remember when I got mine a while back. We were attacking a garri on an alpine bl and I just yeeted my mirror blade to cleave some downed enemies. Sure felt nice to see this achievement pop!
---
&gt; You can buy Reaping (and other) Tools for Karma in all major cities
---
I"M FUCKING SORRY WHAT??
---
THEY SELL REAPING TOOLS AT THE GATHERING VENDORS?!?!?
---
Horrible precedent. 
---
GTFO Casual Plebs. Stop ruining GW2 with your "but I only have 3 hours to play! gimme gimme!" attitude.
---
it's fucking similar enough
---
Having plans for season 5 does not equate 100% chance of season 5 being released is the same as: Having plans for 'guild wars beyond' does not equate 100% chance of it being released.
---
   
---
I'm not god I'm even better I'm Galthing XD
---
don't feel sorry! we want more players
---
 yes you're the one you tell yourself oh how did I get that \^\^

Prototype Rewinder?
---
I'm a Canadian, I have to apologize for apologizing. Sorry.
---
&gt;Guild wars 2 feels more like playing piano to do raid rotations on most classes.
---
If by "playing" you mean, mashing all over the keys, sure.
---
Tera's isn't just different, the mechanics are more interesting, it's more fast paced and engaging, less floaty. It really comes down to what class you play.
---
&gt;trailblazer scourge being used in pve as evidence to deserve being nerfed(soloing overworld mobs even)
---
hahahaha, oh wait are you serious? HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
The funniest part about this video is that everything you did on your scourge, i can do on firebrand too.
---
wrong thread?
---
&gt;No. The combat system in any other MMO cannot hold a candle to GW2. The combat system in this game is as good as it gets. (IMO, duh)
---
Why's that? It's using a 20 year old combat system(tab target), and dodging is just an iframe rather than hit detection. Game is very floaty and your character can just keep running even if they're swinging a massive sword.
---
&gt; It also means that tired raiders can go chill on worldbosses as well, it is not only for non-raiders :)
---
The fact you can "chill" on world bosses is utterly horseshit design. World bosses should be these huge epic bosses that require a large amount of people to coordinate. Not giant pinatas that you autoattack for 10 minutes and get a bit of candy at the end.

It's the Anniversary Mail Carrier.

It’s a bug it’s happening to all summons
---
I need Mordremoth dyes. o.o
---
Absolutely nothing! But you don't do that by making one thing far, far better or more necessary than something else. You do that through reasonable balance and good encounter design. 
---
All you get when you force people into silly mini games or playing something they don't like just because it is so much better is resentment and burn out.
---
Well, I guess we found Canach's Reddit account.
---
Hiiiii so these are the two new headpiece skins side by side, personally I love the revered ones the most!
---
Our preemptive attack against Varesh is going well... Too well...
---
As a Charr, please no
---
I’m not over here saying that the mount is useless, I dunno why everybody’s getting so personally offended that I don’t really like the skyscale and view the griffon as the superior mount. 
---
The skyscale has it’s uses but I just don’t think it’s all that great of a mount, or even a replacement for the springer because the skyscale and he springer are fundamentally different. It’s like saying that the skimmer is a replacement for the raptor and jackal, that doesn’t make any sense at all. The skimmer has it’s merits but most people only really use it on water because of the boost and prefer other mounts for other purposes. 
---
The skyscale doesn’t suck, it’s just objectively great on a couple maps, but not really a great replacer for other mounts and not as great for general purpose usage like the griffon is.
---
Sooooo am I the only one who kinda wants this to be an “armor set”? Pants/boots you get a hatchling clinging on your leg, shoulder it’s like a parrot, chest a hatchling latches to your chest like some of the baby animal backpacks we have and speaking of backpack is self explanatory:p
---
Its a no from me, but I'd bless your heart for a skyscale skin &lt;3

In many cases, old templates will now fail to load. Just overwrite your old templates with new ones and it'll work again.

Hey, Flesh and Sinew looked pretty neat until they somehow messed up the shaders on it and now it's constantly overlit

but that's who they're making the game for at this point
---
tbh I like that GW2 is very casual friendly but as a result I feel like it ends up not being very hardcore friendly at all
---
Yeah I do not understand why people get so angry about pvp and raids either. Maybe because of the HoT content drought but shit that's a stupid reason to be angry in the first place and a hell of a long time to be angry about something that happened in 2016.
---
The probability of raiders being the main income of GW2 is negligible. Raiding here is a niche, though that does not mean it's necessarily wise to disregard this niche. It probably isn't, if I think of the mass exodus due to lack of challenging content in GW2 vanilla. I'd expect them to go on with the rather slow cadence of raid releases for the time being - keep the niche alive, but don't put too many resources into it.

What on earth o0
---
Have you tried Swampblack dye yet? Until I get Abyssal Forest it's been my go-to black/green dye.
---
day of the doggos
---
Well, the title implies that it is you
---
- reads *Come here Aurene*
---
- gets *Come on Eileen* in my head
---
- is both irked and amused
---
Metabattle maybe? There is some others but most aren't kept up to date for overworld, because it is a joke. Just grab trailblazer for any condi weapon and you will be immortal and kill anything. Mix seraph if they have some good healing choices like engie/ele/guardian
---
"I hate content." -/u/Jsvkkie
---
Yes. It is too late. 
---
Helseth was maybe their best known, and he's been done with GW2 for a while now hasn't he?
---
&gt;GW2 needs moar Twitch viewers.
---
No.  GW2 is the type of game that's more fun to play, than watch others play.  Even our world renowned Esports PvP Championships drew only handfulls of viewers.
---
&gt;Every argument you've made about springer vs skyscale has come down to "I'm used to the springer", and insinuations that the springer works just as well for anyone who is oh-so-smart like you.
---
Every argument I’ve made is that the skyscale doesn’t render the springer obsolete, it’s still a mount with it’s own merit. I’m also not saying that I’m super smart, just that I’ve seen people do really dumb shit with the springer, I’ve seen a person try over and over again to hit a small bump with a springer to each a vista, only to immediately find a path with the springer that leads there quickly and see them follow suit. What does that tell me? People are utilizing mounds pretty mindlessly so no wonder they hate the springer. It doesn’t even take half a brain to figure out what does and doesn’t work with each mount.
---
You guys missed the point entirely and maybe it’s because I was being insensitive that people have their panties all up in a bunch but damn, if you feel insulted maybe you really should feel insulted.
---
Good idea to make the skins accessible. I hope they make it reasonable and not that you can only get 1 of them if you grind all week. I raided for a few months but for me GW2 is about dungeons and living story. I don't like 10man groups and all of the chaos that comes with them and I don't like the randomness of fractals. It's annoying to occasionally see some skins I would like to build a theme around be stuck behind raiding.
---
So 5 baby skyscales are needed to pick up Asura. How many for a Charr then?
---
TBH, I don't see the value of streaming MMOs. I think you're hard pressed to find any tangible benefit for these sorts of games. The idea of watching someone play Guild Wars 2, WoW, EVE Online, etc. is just so boring to me. Streaming is best for games that have reactionary value, like action games, horror titles, etc. There are certainly moments of this in GW2. Raiding, PvP, WvW, etc. But they're nothing really that compelling to watch. It's better for them to actually be played, and I think the effort should be put exclusively there. If the content is good enough, people will stream it.
---
I love account bound. 
---
What I hate is soulbound and wish that would all convert to account bound.
---
Is this a joke? You can't seriously think a 2k dps Scourge is impressive, right? A regular pve Scourge can solo all of this, except ten times faster.
---
Yeye helseth doesn’t really stream now, he does only occasionally but gives up 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
---
This doesn't start until the 11th, right?
---
What trait lines do I need to take for "Mirages' clones jerking each other off"? Asking for a fake friend.
---
Yeh I totally with it’s more fun to play but I believe it’s also fun to watch
---
To add to this post there are many articles out there that directly link large/popular twitch communities increase game sales. This even went to show new games, old games, and current games releasing DLC.   
---
Twitch has a bounty system, however I have not seen GW2 on the bounty program. I have seen other MMOs on there. I have other friends who are streamers with large communities who want to play GW2, but won't stream it as their viewership drops. I'd like to see GW2 work with Twitch, and it's twitch streamers to help grow the community online. I've seen MMO's give their partnered streamers in game Titles that are a different color and unique to bring in game players into their twitch community.   
---
Good post. Grass is greener where you water it.
---
Oh cool, thank you!
---
No, that's different. This event is the meta rush. That event is around the new raid.
---
If you click on 'Show me where to go' from the in-game UI, it'll bring up the map and circle a location...
---
If you wait a few seconds it'll show another and keep showing you more locations after.
---
This game is amazing, a lot of content to do...
---
This is a list of links to comments made by ArenaNet employees in this thread:

I can be on board with this but I still think streams of say the mAT are great and more people could tune into the hype
---
good thing chrono has alternative options now ;)
---
keep in mind not all the metas on those timers count for the rush. junundu rising does not give the bonus boxes for example
---
About as similar to S4 ending "in a way there might not be a S5" when they had S5 planned before S4 was even 2 releases out.
---
It isn't as similar as you proclaim. Which didn't start as "plans are plans and are not final". GJ changing your argument as you ragequit.
---
This is a great suggestion! This is exactly the sort of thing I want anet to just try and maybe look into, anywhose thanks for reading and complimenting. 😊
---
I put junk gathering tools on all my characters so i can just double click the shared slots to swap back and forth. Makes it a lot more convenient to share them.
---
Well I'm sorry if the title mislead. I'm just coming back to the game wondering what I wanna play and I don't understand what's goin on at all with the meta, builds or anything lol. I stopped playing a bit before HoT came out and I just saw this vid so I took to reddit to see if it's legit or ya know video tricks or shiz. It's just seems a bit weird to me that classes are able to solo world content that's normally intended for groups, but hey if I don't have to use lfg I'm down xD
---
I could get into the general concepts behind good editing and making any kind of trailer, like why it's a bad idea to have a static shot of an animation loop.. but given that your attitude towards it is so dismissive i won't waste either of our time
---
stay edgy!
---
From purely a gear acquisition standpoint, Bitterfrost Frontier is still the best map in the game to obtain ascended trinkets.  Dragonfall is certainly good as well, but Bitterfrost gives an absurd amount of map currency in a super condensed area with no daily limit (so you can farm Bitterfrost on every single character).
---
Know what else would also help?
---
Salty GW2 streamers not bashing the game for "lack of content", and GW2 streamers not bashing each other and not sticking to their own clique.
---
The community canabalizes itself very well.
---
Like seriously, it looks much better actually in-game than this trailers depicts. What the actual hell.   
---
Also the boring low-poly Vabbi architecture with again the branded crystals theme which we were already tired of is so boring and overdone already. Super meh.
---
I'm not insulting you for enjoying dungeons, I'm insulting you for projecting what you want this game to be about onto what this game is actually about.
---
This is the definition of entitlement.
---
Guess they are still looking into it
---
Rotating the greatsword on autoattack wasn't "left out." They made a unique animation for charr and asura, so it would've taken the same amount of time to design it as the rotating option. But what they did instead was make it so that charr and asura hold onto the greatsword and point with it like a wand. This animation is superior than the levitate-rotate animation on the humanoids, because it indicates mastery over precise magical techniques and the ability to use the greatsword as a specialized magic tool, rather than as a generic focus. This makes thematic sense for charr and asura specifically, since those two races have the longest and richest history of the mastery of magical techniques.
---
I feel like the legendary Armor is something like the stronghold and the adventures...they poeople did not really like it and instead of fixing them they moved on and tried new things.
---
Starts today through the 11th!
---
PSA: Don't bother with those bosses. You'll earn x2-x3 the rewards by just staying in SW. If you have a full  map you can do a full map cycle in about 25-30 minutes.
---
When DotA 2 held its annual The International tournament a couple years back, in addition to the regular streams with regional hypecasters, they also had a separate stream called the Newcomer/Noob stream or something like that. 
---
Basically instead of hypecasters, the stream was dedicated solely to educate new people who never heard of or never tried the game. So you'll have people talk about things like the different heroes, items, game mechanics etc.
---
Not sure if they still have it around though. Last time I checked, they removed it, which is unfortunate because it brought a lot of people into the game that year. But I haven't followed the game and its esports scene in years so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
As for whether or not Anet should do this, I think it's a matter of resources. Valve is definitely bigger than Anet, with a community that I'm sure greatly outnumbers ours. So while I don't see how Anet will pull it off, I wouldn't get my hopes up either.
---
ALRIGHT SUNSPEARS LET'S DO THIS KORMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!
---
So you read my post, imagined a slight that isn't there, and got mad. Gotcha, great speaking with you. Very logical.
---
in the beginning you will be wiping a fair bit as you learn the mechanics and phases provided you don't study beforehand.  That's just part of the learning process, no different than fractals.  After that it's just pulling your weight depending on your role and hoping that the rest of your pug does the same.
---
&gt;but that's who they're making the game for at this point
---
I have no idea who they're making the game for.
---
For this specific event, you want to use the link from OP.  Outside of that, I like this setup the best: https://gw2timer.com/?mode=Tile
---
No, this one is [June 4 to June 11](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-meta-event-rush/).
---
I'm not claiming that you were making the slight intentionally, just that it was there.
---
Soon ^tm
---
What’s SW
---
Yeah, Wiki mentions it but that can be overlooked; I'll also add this warning to the top comment.
---
Silverwastes. The meta boss there is Vinewrath.
---
Got it in Dragonball of all things. That particular employee ended up on my team next round, so I thanked him for the achievement-apparently they didn't know it was possible to get it there! Apparently they did not work on adding that achieve.
---
Still praying for the legendary pantaloons to have the tail armor effect on charr again, instead of the chest piece.
---
&gt; ...Newcomer/Noob stream...
---
Yea that was a great steam for newbies. I dont think they have done them since but im not 100% on that.
---
&gt;As for whether or not Anet should do this, I think it's a matter of resources.
---
Maybe some folks from the community could try something like that for a monthly AT or something. Like a Gw2 Spvp for total newbs cast.
---
Funny.. I’m a returning player as of just now lol. The market is dry... GW2 looks glorious! Why did I ever leave.... smh.
---
I've grinded it to disgust many years ago, so no thank you, instead I'll do the new ones which I find fun and which also give other goodies.
---
Always played gw2 while watching youtube with no trouble
---
Blacklion salvage kit.
---
Dunno how often you visit r/gw2 but it’s anything but silence. The devs are actually telling us new information and communicating about things which are coming. They have even been open to suggestions on their experiments with these weekly events they are doing too.
---
I watch streams largely for the personalities of the streamers. It's uncommon for me to watch for the game specifically, and GW2 is really not a game built for streaming. Not every game is going to be good for viewership and it doesn' have to be. Build a game to be PLAYED first.
---
I second this
---
I got all dyes from Mordremoth Dye Kit before Today. R.I.P. my Account Value on gw2efficiency :( My "Uncloked Dyes" value dropped from 12k+ to 4,8k :(
---
Thanks! I have a few lying around.
---
...and while typing this I realized the refractor is only worth 14g, the infusion is the valuable one. For a moment I thought I could be rich. Oh well.
---
Agree, but oddly OSRS pulls really good numbers.
---
Probably says more for our autism than anything though..
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-meta-event-rush/
---
Thief would be medium ...
---
np. I immediately fell for my own timer and did an event that didn't qualify!
---
Annoyingly there's a tiny chance anyone who visited in the time between 20:01 utc and 20:09 might have had their regular event timer settings reset. rip.
---
Yeah that's the Stalker headpiece
---
&gt; Legendaries are optional content.
---
But ppl still do them, because there is nothing to do with this game at some point in time. Same here. You turn off your brains and just do the story
---
&gt; FFXIV raids are kinda average. Yes, there's a lot of them. But they're average and they get old fast.
---
And in gw2 we have one raid in 9 month at best. With zero news about it until it ready. So..If we talks about quantity vs quality in terms of raids i prefer quantity, because watching the SAME patterns gets really boring. Like Escort. Or River. Or statues. Or event at W1. Yes, some things still bugged, like Samarog still can get bugged and lose his focus target if target gets downed the very moment he try to jump (happened to me twice) or it can bug and be immortal after CC, so that's adds element of surprise in fight, but that's it.  
---
&gt; a much better overall experience.
---
Until you farm shit of it - yes. And then you staying at afk point waiting for bugged event to finish another legendary. 
---
&gt; You can repeat GW2's story with a lot of variations based on your background and choices 
---
Only vanilla one. After this story only differ at a few dialogue. And LWS basically have zero personality in them. You are JUST commander. So much for choice.....
---
That's stalker armor.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stalker_armor
---
I will thank you!
---
Chronomancer will never not be good in PvE.
---
Yeye I agree with this, I understand where your coming from.
---
They'll jump in there sometimes after the weekly WvW stream, so anyone who wants to unlock the achievement should keep an eye on that.
---
Buccaneer armor with a skyscale on the shoulder....
---
It's not humping. It's being pulled by the flapping of its wings while the character continues to be pulled by gravity.
---
Thier lame ass  excuse is that people without expansions wouldn't be able to participate. 
---
Or how about it would incentivize people to get xpacs, so they could join in. You can't get mounts without xpacs either but they viewed that as a selling point, not a reason to not do it. 
---
It's criminal how they've abandoned guild activities. Decent activities with decent rewards would energise the game a lot, and provide repeatable content over a long time. 
---
More than a one time story every 4-5 months or raids which many find off-putting. 
---
And the worst part is, the content in game is already there!  Events, activities, Mount races, bounties. They don't even have to make new stuff!!
---
Never heard of Atlantica but from the sound of it it's for the most part pay to win. Account bound thinks might restrict the market in your eyes but it also prevents someone from dumping a bunch of money into the game and being at the highest level of involvement. It's definitely healthier for the game to have things that are restricted to playing the game. Instead of thinking anet should do away with account bound stuff, why not be thankful that account bound even exists and it's not all soulbound to the character.
---
The Skyscale collections were way too grindy and repetitive for my liking. I've found the collections for Vision to be much more enjoyable.
---
It's free repeatable content, that could use activities already in game. 
---
They are fucking stupid.
---
Could you explain where it seems to you this is delusional to ask of a character in this game please? Maybe I could profit from your insight, lower my criteria while grasping a better understanding of the game and choose a better class for me.
---
Dungeons are designed to be cleared by a full party of 5 by the way :) while many can be solo/duoed it won't be easy as undergeared low level characters and not much game experience. 
---
As for class the usual tank in gw2 is a chrono (mesmer) but it's more about evading hits than just standing there and taking them all. Or you could also try a firebrand since that can also fill a similar tank/buffing role as chrono but is not quite as common yet. Although outside of raids there is no such thing as a tank
---
Tab targeting in this game does not feel like traditional tab targeting MMO combat. For one the targeting system actually has some decent weighting behind it so that you generally pick the target you want out of a crowd which minimises the need to actually use it. There's auto-targeting if you're not interested in pressing buttons and well, you can use the vast majority of your skills without needing to have a target to begin with.
---
Dodging being iframes is what I prefer, there's a threshold of fun vs realism that a system like you described would cross for me. That said, I can still enjoy physically-based hit detection systems but I don't think it has a place in MMO combat.
---
What's floaty about it? The movement has instant acceleration, that's literally the opposite of floaty.
---
The design of boons create a really interesting dynamic due to the short ranges and durations, that is rare in other MMOs.
---
The lack of a global cooldown and abundant instant-casts make for many many options and even more combinations of skills that you can perform to get any desired result. 
---
Always having something to think about rotation-wise thanks to many short duration buffs, hidden cooldowns and auto attacks make pressing buttons in this game wayyyy more fun than any other MMO I've encountered and I've been playing them all my life. 
---
Anywhere else you go and you have a very strict rotation to follow with about 2-3 inputs per second at most. GW2 is a whole order of magnitude more active than that. In any other MMO, you cast your buffs at the start of the instance and that's it for the next 30 minutes. Not to mention the beautiful animations, skill effects and sounds that have plenty of gusto. Not to mention how fast the game responds to your inputs compared to something such as XiV or Runescape.
---
I'm not saying GW2 is flawless, but in terms of MMO combat there really is not anything that can come close to how complex you can go with it and how fun it is to actually press the buttons. How else can you explain WvW and sPvP still holding on from the brink of death after all of these years with nothing but neglect from Arenanet and being shunned by the general population. It's because the game (the combat) is really that fun and there's nothing else that matches it.
---
I've never seen something with as much potential as I see in GW2, and it makes me very sad to see Arenanet move further and further away from their original manifesto. They once believed in their combat system.
---
Regardless I am very excited for wing 7, it's going to be a lot of fun.
---
I just hope the raiding community can keep itself together after the fresh raid smell wears off and I hope that Arenanet can push the next one out a bit sooner otherwise there may not be a raiding community left to play it.
---
...  
---
. . .  
---
I literally replayed the first 3 seconds of this video like six times before I even *NOTICED* that a fucking running spirit appeared right on top of you.  Fuck this game's awful visual clarity. lol
---
there is nothing wrong with streaming MMOs or any game for that but you need to remember, if you aint pro people are there for your personality. something that makes those big wow and osrs streamers popular
---
the warclaw is a drastically different case was poorly handled in more regards than the skyscale might have.. the skyscale is more comparable to the rollerbeetle if anything. it's a mount meant for the general public, and supposed to be a selling argument for the episode and season. the release of skins will produce a secondary wave of excitement about the mount, and as such it is beneficial to ANet to stretch it out a bit. sure, there is a realistic threshold for how long they can hold skins back risk free, but you also have to consider that it's not a nice experience for players to potentially get RNG skins they can't even use (yet). it's a balancing act.
---
7% of gw2efficiency users, which are generally thought to be amongst the more engaged and informed players. in other words the true percentage is likely lower.
---
To me it sounds like upgradable skins...
---
I do like that they have them available to open world players...  Maybe it will encourage some new blood into the raid scene so they can finish their skin upgrades.
---
Because: being a bunker =/= being effective in group play. For 95% of the group play: More DPS, faster kill, less dmg taken. There are only a few raid bosses that have a toughness tanking mechanic and that's the job of a chronomancer
---
Nice! Need to do Orr for Dusk achievement collection.
---
Answers to this question may include - but are not limited to:
---
* Expansion 3
---
* Season 5
---
* Upcoming Elite Specs
---
* Guild Wars 3
---
* A new Anet game
---
That's like 7350 gold or liken $270 worth of gems...but worst of all its like 27 more character names I'd need to think up.
---
&gt; daily crafting for timegated materials
---
Mithrillium, Elonian Cord, Charged Quartz, Silk Weaving Thread, and Elder Spirit Residue. They're all on the list, conveniently grouped in the "Crafting" category. https://gw2efficiency.com/daily
---
not in the open world section.  they almost always have a "lost 15% damage but gain 50% EHP" stat set suggestion.
---
They’re probably talking about Anet mainly using dark skinned humans for their marketing ever since PoF. It’s obviously a conscious choice on Anet’s end, most likely for representation and the like
---
I dunno, I don’t see the issue with it as long as they’ll go for a mix after PoF‘s era and won‘t continue with it when we get say a Cantha expansion for example bc that‘d be weird. 
---
if anything I‘m annoyed with them always making really gaudy looks for the characters in these posts
---
It's a joke that might come true. The phrase "Q X of 201X saw an X of roughly x.xbil Won" is from NCsoft's quarterly earnings reports, which includes Guild Wars 2. Won is the Korean currency. OP at the top of the thread is joking that this gem store item will cause an influx of profits, when Anet hasn't had improving profits for the past few quarters. You could interpret this as a hail mary to turn around the quarter earnings.
---
Also: nice little detail is that the dragons all gently scatter into different directions upon landing. They don't poof right away. I'm certainly happy that I got it.
---
I'm taking the title exactly as it is written and it's written like an idiot who wanted to get a rise out of people whining about builds and then backpedaled when things didn't go their way.
---
For people who enjoyed this, I found the legendary weapons to be similar but more in depth. I came back when PoF released and completely missed HoT. Crafting Astralaria was the funnest thing I’ve done in the game.
---
I deserve this.
---
Well PoF metas also give amalgamated gemstones now.
---
They certainly could, and I think that's an area to look into. Getting people who will routinely cast ATs and make a whole event of it. The problem is that the content isn't yet good enough for it. Spectator controls aren't great, and the games can be really hard to cast and keep people on the same page. So, again, I think that this is an issue with the content needing work, not needing incentives for people to stream.
---
I thought the unannounced projects were mobile, I remember reading that NC kept asking Anet for a mobile game.
---
I know how hard I'm dreaming on this one... but in the past when we have gone from the season end to an expansion announcement, we have hardly had a wait at all. IIRC, LS2 to HoT was one or two weeks? I believe PoF was days! 
---
I realize this is just one season to the next, but sounds like Anet is trying something different with this one.
---
I mean... definitely not going to get my hopes up. But would be super cool.
---
You can try it for yourself.
---
Personally, unless I'm doing something that requires a higher level of focus (i.e PvP), I'm often watching something on YouTube and playing GW2 at the same time.
---
"Other hand."
---
God damn that's about the dumbest thing ive seen lol
---
I want that so bad ):
---
So asura must be quite dense
---
Got any gif of that?
---
*I'm the only sane person in this universe.*
---
I'm stuck in the 3 day, completely unnecessary, timegate of part three. And I don't want to hear "It's so you can experience the joy of waiting for your skyscale to grow, otherwise it would be unrealistic." No, its wasting three days of progress, for the sake of wasting three days of progress. I'm unlocking a mount. I don't need the simulated realism of raising a digital dragon.
---
uhhhhh
---
LS2 to HoT was not two weeks lmao, it was ten months... and PoF was 2-3 months I think.
---
I wish I had knowledge of gif-making so I could show you.
---
Oh my god, this has been bugging me for SO LONG. Thank you.
---
A new game engine bringing better performance, a man can dream.
---
Thank you very much this brings light on lots of things especially fractals and raids. I will take a look at the Guardian. I will still finish my warrior as other people have told it is quite in demand even if it isn't as unique utility-wise. Thanks again. Maybe one day we'll raid side-by-side ;)
---
They did, but most of them went to get the one from Choya Pinata instead, I assume.  Today when I did it, the full map stuck around and waited when I pointed out that people could do Choya Pinata later before reset but if they left Elon Riverlands now, they'd need to do the whole wait again if they came back for the next go-round.  But when this bonus week is over, I imagine most players are simply going to deem the meta "too much waiting" and just not show up at all.
---
Specifically, with BiS gear (Ascended or Legendary) a light armour character will suffer about 15% more direct damage than a heavy armour character.
---
It's exactly identical to having an extra 304 toughness.
---
&gt; karma
---
Where do you find the karma version of that one?
---
Got way too much of the hate train but it's one of the best reasons they gave me to play the game in years. Yes, some of them were tedious and repetitive but I'm okay with that. 
---
Thanks Anet. Please keep this idea alive.
---
The people say that people who call them out as toxic are usually the most toxic. You made a stupid post and knew exactly the response it would get, that the build is overpowered and needs to be nerfed. And your weak attempts to walk it back aren't fooling anyone. It's not toxicity, it's not wanting to put up with your bullshit.
---
Originally wanted these to put on my Charr based on my Maine Coon cat but that was months ago and she's since drastically changed her appearance.
---
If anyone wants to mimic Maine Coon ears though, these are the way.
---
Gatescale would be 500% better collection if first 3 and the last collections never existed.
---
I really could not justify pressing extra 80+ times F without a single justifiable reason. i can get on board with all the mini games and timegates related to feeding, doing dome open world events. But looking for Gatescale dropping all around the world to press F...
---
And in gw2.
---
An Elonian character, dressed in the new Elonian armor, was the stand-in for all the PCs during PoF and the story episodes since.
---
My assumption is that with the next expansion, we'd see something similar. Why wouldn't we?
---
That someone could get so upset over that... it's kinda sad.
---
Yeah this is exactly why. It was originally meant to be timed exclusive events but it was a waste of content later and made the story weird for new players which is why the later seasons are made in a much more open fashion. Outside of a few key events they could recreate somehow in a temporary way offering LS1 anytime would be... difficult
---
Yeah but you're linking the layoff to gw3 in your first post, and now you say 
---
&gt;they had 150ish extra staff just for the mobile game
---
Either the 100+ layoff was about the cancelled mobile game or gw3, and I personally never read anything about GW3, only mobile game, that's what their job openings pointed at before.
---
You should know that Guardian is almost exclusively used as a dps, not a tank. It has decent tanking skills, with lots of blocks, so it would make a fine tank, but it has even better dps skills, and it would be a waste to not dps with it. Chronomancer has better tanking skills and is the premier tank of the game.
---
I enjoyed griffon's collection much more.
---
I agree that they should do this the other way around, when they introduce living world, there should be something for hardcore, like a 5 man with a CM even of one of the boss fight or something like this.
---
And yes that keeps both group split, I don't think we can do better than that, there is also no evidence that the gw2 playerbase is willing to change and i doubt that ANet is going to risk alienating 90% of their playerbase to make the other 10% happy, in the hopes that maybe hardcore players from other start joining this game.
---
Those stupid cars might have been the dumbest fucking thing I ever saw in a game.
---
Really? I don't remember it. Granted it's been a long time since i raided, but you'd think i'd remember something that sweet.
---
You guys should consider zooming out on that feature a bit, because whenever i dont have the map portion uncovered, i can't see where is it. I know there are multiple other ways to find out, but just trying to make more intuitive
---
Whatever you say chief &lt;3
---
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah sorry I misread!!
---
Mirage stacking gets even funnier and more painful when it bugs and a dead clone becomes revivable, and you spend several seconds wondering who's down and why you can't res them.
---
I laughed out loud, thanks
---
Armor, toughness and vitality are more like your third line of defense. Your first is dodges - either via endurance or skills. The second line of defense is blocks: either in form of the boon aegis, or skills that block/make you invulnerable to attacks.
---
Now chrono brings moderately aegis for his group, and for himself personally an insane amount of blocks and evades. So its a quite tanky specc without having to invest in toughness, which in turn means that even if you are actually tanking raid bosses, you still can do moderate dps as well.
---
And then theres the utility. Sure, quickness for 5 people can be provided by firebrand - way easier I might add - and alacrity for 10 man is just 1 button push every 16 seconds on alacrity renegade. But neither firebrand nor renegade can bring a focus pull, which a lot of tactics in raids and fractals want. Also, a quickbrand is quite squishy if you dont go for a fully defensive healer variant of the build - same with renegade.
---
On top of that, chrono brings boon extension, which is quite insane tbh. In raids - which are 10man PvE encounters - 2 chronos bring a 3 second boon extension every roughly 6 seconds. Its a 50% boon duration increase. Gw2 boons are extremely strong, so thats pretty nice to have. The quickness firebrand and alacrity renegade comp on the other hand doesnt bring any boon extension, so boons have to be constantly re-applied. Considering most encounters have phases that force you to spread out and do mechanics... well, its not quite as useful. Mind you, thats from a raid perspective. In fractals theres few split-up mechanics and there firebrand + renegade rules supreme ;)
---
Reading your entry post, I think you will like chronomancer. In Gw2, every class comes with a rotation, thats just because we have a cooldown management system instead of ressource management system as underlying combat system. Most rotations however are quite easy, and apart from an "opening" rotation usually consist of "keep skills x, y, z on cooldown until next opening rotation".
---
Let me know if you want a breakdown of the opening rotation for chrono and what to do in-between.
---
Mostly I think you will like chrono because its a tanky specc, has ton of utility and often tanks in raids - therefore is the most comfortable position for raid lead in my opinion.
---
As to your side questions: Dungeons are oldest group content, never got an update really and quite abandoned. Fractals are your typical 1 group content with a difficulty scaling system t1 to t4, with 2 challenge mode t4 fractals being the most challenging content. Higher tier fractals also have a sort of gear progression -&gt; you'll need ascended gear with infusions. Id suggest reading up on it on the wiki (enter /wiki fractals into ig chat).
---
Raids are 10 man group (or in that case "squad") content.
---
Openworld is for mass-PvE-zerg-events, no group or squad coordination needed. You dont need skill, or gear for those really, but there are some that are quite well done and a lot of fun. Especially HoT map meta events consist of slaughtering lots of mobs with one final "worldboss" at the end to get good loot afterwards, which might not be challenging at all, but good for the MMORPGers soul ;)
---
As to reactive spammy supporter, definitely heal and/or tank firebrand. In each gamemode.
---
I just want to point out that quickbrand brings a lot more aegis, and renegade kalla elite is on par with condi druid healing before nerf, even on a full diviner renegade build.
---
In fractals you can use tome1, skill3 and GS5 pulls instead of focus pulls. Axe3 if you bring a healfirebrand. 
---
If you play with a chrono you most definitely need some other supporter that can provide 25 might, so you are also searching for 2 slots. In my experience as long as you arent totally married to running the very specific "only diviner/berserker" comp, LFG fills pretty fast searching for renegade+firebrand. Nowadays it takes me longer to find a bannerwarrior than to find firebrand and renegade.
---
Anyone know how to add these timers to the Taco timer?
---
It was good journey. Apart from the 1 stack of various currency.
---
Is this needed for the legendary trinket?
---
Support chrono wants diviner. If you want the most optimal highest damage support build follow [discretize's Hybrid chrono](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer). If you want something that works in raids as well you can modify the [snowcrows raid build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/) to have more boon duration. Pug fractals means you want to get close or hit 100% boon duration with food/utility. Fractals give 15% from the potions at 150AR and rune of the pack is another 15%. You want more boon duration also because you won't have anyone else increasing or supplying boons like you would in raids. You can also check out [metabattle's suggestions](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Utility_Boon_Support_\(Fractal\)) for fractal support chrono.
---
Also consider that DPS chrono is an option instead if you're interested in that.
---
Raid armor visuals are a massive failure, and dye channels is just one of them. My biggest concern is the white glow after stow, which is an eyesore if you mix lege armor with non-lege pieces. And the whole medium armor visuals... people need to get fired for that.
---
Anet has a tendency to abandon any released content after the 2-week hotfix period is over (not even mentioning bugged maps and events which stay broken for years, like who even remembers the fifth champion after SW meta?). This needs to be constantly talked about. This should be the main concern and the main theme of discussion in this sub.
---
Openworld, sure. Anything you do solo - sure.
---
Group content? Nope.
---
Arguably norgu was the shiniest
---
A sexy season 5 trailer and strong marketing!
---
They need to talk about season 5. There are so many questions that need answered. 1. Season 5 will it have new maps every episode (I say this knowing they have said they won't be forced into a map every episode). 2. Elite specs, Anet has said they want living world to do what expansions can does this mean a new set of elite specs. 3. Raids will they continue alongside Fractals development. 4. Is there an expansion planned (I'm not looking for a name just for confirmation its being planned. Finally 6. Is season 1 planned because that little recap doesn't work. These are things they need to clear up, your right they look to be going to market stuff but how hard is it for the to get on the PC gaming show like they did in 2015. Other than GW2 I'm hoping for a Fable announcement
---
Those cars...
---
New Player here. Is this worth my time to start now? Or is this game on it's way out? Long time WoW player from back in the day looking to get into an MMO that isn't WoW.
---
i dont think theres anything wrong with the place myself, i feel its a lil underused. Would love to see it developed into a form of personal home/base, one that we keep returning to like Rata Novus in LS3, with our home instance nodes, sunspear sanctuary NPC's, and a true Mini guild hall for Dragon's Watch and the Commanders Base of operations. Would be nice to see the place develop and change over time.
---
hey, when my celestial cocks can hold my fat norn in the air for the last 3 years, these skyscales will too. :D
---
You want to hear about a new game 4 after employees working on other games (yes this would include a GW3) I highly doubt it and I hope not. Anet can sustain themselves as a one company game or two company game if they give GW1 some love.
---
You'd think, but I only have 36 locked dyes....so I figure I'll save myself something for future birthday unlocks since we've been getting a new pack each year. ;) Saves me gold too.
---
Honestly I love the transform *except* the trenchcoat. It adds tons of cool effects on medium armor like the wrap around tail, but the trenchcoat is so bulky
---
I know a lot of people complained about it and I'm just one person but I gotta say Im loving the process. Due to health problems with a family member I spend all day in the hospital and then come home late at night. Loading up GW2 and working on a collection for a bit has been a great stress relief for me.
---
I always like new and experimental builds. I used to run something like this in fractals sometimes whit zealots when other healing options were not available. That being said, consider using [http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) to present builds, makes it a bit more easier to read and easier for people to check what it does. If you really want people to start using it consider making a short video how it works and where it shines.
---
For PvP, most of the time being "good at it" is more a matter of finding a fun build OR finding the easiest out there and running with it. I got majorly into PvP around the time Dragonhunter was essentially a guaranteed win. Traps were so broken. That was also back when they first added ascended armor to PvP and hadn't balanced its acquisition. So I farmed basically an entire suit of armor from PvP in one season. I then transitioned into the time when Scourge was a guaranteed win. Both of those times, I facerolled with whatever was most popular/broken.
---
The only really frustrating part was doing that "win X games in a day" but for me that meant setting aside one day for each of those and just playing games until it happened. Once your rating settles, you will usually break 50/50 on your games. Other than that, I appreciated that the progress never reset and that when I felt burnt out I would just go play some other part of the game and Ascension would be there when I felt like it.
---
I actually very recently went back and completed the last profession achievements to fill out the whole category and found it pretty cool to learn new tricks about the other classes (except revenant, that was hell, I could never get it down)
---
gw2efficiency can give you that info, if you create an account and add your API key to it
---
Try gw2efficiency. Not sure if trading post websites can connect with your account, but gw2e can.
---
Game is still going strong and the base game is free to play, no reason not to try it out. It has a very unique feel to me especially with the more active combat compared to a lot of other MMOs. Try it out and see if you like it, if you have any questions about the game or getting started let us know.
---
I remember there was a build for power scourge and it had decent dps over 20k but that was like half a year ago or even a year
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/ is great for all of that. Specifically the [materials tab](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/materials) is what you're looking for.
---
That's what I was thinking about it not being a power spec. As for reaper that looks fun too but I am not a fan of minions, so could you as good at soloing without them?
---
3rd time trying this. A new problem arose. Every few seconds the game slows down. It doesn't "stutter" per-se but it slows down, speeds up, slows down again... as if it's playing constant catch-up.
---
Fps-wise it's a wonder in zergs, doesn't seem to give two shits about model limit.
---
You can try core game for free and see if you like it. Do know that expansion content is a lot bigger and generally more immersive, fun and challenging.
---
Almost all of its content is relevant so time of starting doesnt really matter.
---
(gonna be downvoted but...)
---
Gw2 is dying a slow death, and the only thing that can save it is a new expansion.
---
anet while u are at it make legendary raid ring available for casual too.
---
Been keeping track of most official sales or deals [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Expansion_Sales).
---
You are right thanks. But the damage is quite low (3 ennemies hit Max and cannot crit...) And I prefere don't waste too much time in air if not needed.
---
Good catch though ;)
---
The game suffers from the inevitable fate that all MMOs suffer from; eventually, it will die off
---
That being said, that won't be anytime soon. New content is coming out, new players are joining, and a lot of changes have been coming to make the game better than ever. 
---
And if you're worried about catching up, you also don't have to worry about that. Unlike WoW, where you have to play the grind to stay competitive every expansion, the end game is all focused around the level cap that's been in game since the beginning
---
I'm dumb xD I will ;) thanks
---
minions are for openworld rather shit anyway. sigil which gives strengh  + both damage wells and you have a way bigger burst potential.
---
I'm still in the process of it. You guys seriously don't find it unnecessarily tedious at all?
---
I got all 3 :D
---
I liked the slow tease rollout of War Eternal, I hope they do that a lot more in the future. It would make the stretches in between episodes much more tolerable.
---
So I hope we start getting at least minor teases for Season 5 soon.
---
I only got it recently so I dunno if anything's changed, but I would definitely describe the animation as "very clunky and awkward"
---
One of them does iirc
---
Time gating and making you go through the maps several times over
---
I really enjoyed it. I thought that the first phase, with the three different Dragonsfall collections in a row got a bit repetitive, but after that the other steps were a lot of fun.
---
Post expansion lull is normal. Besides, tons of WoW refugees have been flooding noob areas lately
---
Staff CC comes mostly from air 3 and earth 5. Static field and line are almost impossible to hit on targets that dont move making them pointless. D/w has shocking aura+detonate, water+air 4, immob from earth 3, chill from water 3 (usually used as blast). There's also aoe blind on earth 5 and better protection on earth 4 (which extends all boons and blasts as well).
---
As I said, there's a lot of situations where conditions arent an issue so fire spec is completely worthless in that case. 
---
In case you want even more boons you can take pack runes (extra might+fury source) and arcane spec which can also help with reviving allies. Your fury in that case would come from air 2 on dagger and pack runes, later shared with fire 4 on warhorn, earth 4 and chrono. After enough practice and with better chrono I'm pretty sure that pack runes wont even be needed.
---
Support tempest is extremely versatile in pve, but only value of staff is constant heals around boss and revive potential which are generally useful only in damage heavy raid bosses where you take 10 man shouts and turn into healbot. Boons are not staff's business.
---
They must have only of changed it within the pass few days :( the scarf flowed so nicely it was a very unique and nice design I have no idea why’d they take it out :(
---
They kind of already do. If you're too close to AR when you get picked, it waits about 5 seconds then picks someone else. Had this happen in a map I was in 2 days ago!
---
Erm.. No.  
---
There is a thing called.. working for your rewards.
---
How often is metabattle updated though? I thought it was pretty rare now
---
I'm a bit curious... But I think I know the answer. The bobblehead doesn't work on them, right? It works on chair at least.
---
Your build will work decently. It has plenty of boon duration and thus can easily achieve permanent Quickness and Alacrity on allies, provided that they stand in your Wells.
---
However, this build could use a few tweaks. Currently it is sort of a generalist, and that's fine; you'll be decent at most things. If you wanted some advice:
---
* Carry two extra weapons in your inventory: a focus and an offhand sword. Swap out your GS for the focus in group content, so that you can pull groups of enemies together to be cleaved down. Swap out the GS for an offhand sword when you want more damage but don't need to pull enemies together. Keep the GS equipped when soloing in the open world.
---
* Decide what content you will focus on. If you're only doing open world, your current Commander gear is probably fine. You'll survive forever but kill slower, but I'm sure you're fine with that. If you want to do small group content, get a set of Diviner's gear - it will similarly give you so much boon duration that you'll be able to effortlessly maintain boons, but it will increase your damage. Keep your Commander gear in the bank in case you want to try tanking raids some day.
---
* Familiarize yourself with all your traits and all the different ways you can change your traits to handle various scenarios in group play:
---
   * Boon Rip - taking Domination trait "Shattered Concentration" removes boons from enemies when you shatter, useful for enemies that apply Protection to themselves.
---
   * CC - taking Domination trait "Confounding Suggestions" makes your F3 shatter a much stronger CC, useful for enemies with breakbars (almost all bosses in group content).
---
   * Reflects - taking Inspiration trait "Warden's Feedback" makes your focus phantasms and your focus' skill Temporal Curtain into reflects. This is crucial on enemies that have powerful ranged attacks and allows you to cover reflects without sacrificing a utility skill slot for Feedback.
---
   * Aegis - taking Inspiration trait "Blurred Inscriptions" and automatic minor trait "Inspiring Distortion" allow you to grant Aegis to party members whenever you press F4 or use a signet skill, useful for saving allies from large deadly one-hit-KO attacks.
---
   * Protection &amp; DPS - taking Chronomancer trait "Chronophantasma" makes you summon two phantasms instead of one, which makes your shield phantasm apply twice as much Protection, and makes your offhand sword and GS phantasms much more deadly.
---
No because the brand is permanent so there will still be branded creatures within the brand
---
As you've said, the mystic tribute requires 250 mystic coins. As for the 234 others, it is indeed for mystic clovers. Mathematically speaking, you have 30% chance of getting mystic clovers (no matter the recipe) out of the mystic forge, you'd need around 234 mystic coins and some other mats to obtain those 77 clovers. 
---
The best scenario would be you having to use only a few hundreds of mystic coins, the worst would be you having to buy more than 234 coins.
---
this poor soul still believes anet works on old content when they don't absolutely have to

It’s on the table

---
Yeah and sadly Machined weapons did not reset their stats.
---
At this point I don't care about clipping anymore, bring on the playable centaurs. =-p
---
Adorable!
---
I didn't see it but now I do, and I think I NEED this glider now.
---
Does that make me a horrible person? Probably.
---
I mean, the ascended armor is just that
---
Dude, you are plain out lying to yourself.
---
How in the world did that person ended in this position ?
---
Is it more dumb than Revelation Online's giant flying cat mount that seats 5-people?
---
The place where the Raid is was branded long ago. Just like Siren's Landing still has Risen, there will still be branded out there.
---
If it did people would propably annoy devs, asking them to get them the 3 creater achievements
---
Fun. It's about fun.
---
You can get mystic clovers from some PvP/wvw reward tracks. If you do any of those, it's a good way to earn some clovers. Check the Wiki page for it.
---
I'm referring to the announcement of zen 3 over last week not zen 2. There's a significant performance diffrence that's puts the intel's 1st cores to shame. Once they're release its basically what's the point buying Intel for a desktop pc? Read some articles on the specs and engineering. Overall amd has been dominating the multi core market for awhile since zen 2
---
Dragonfall. Just play Dragonfall. I had over 12k VM by the end of the first two days.
---
by the time it hit you
---
No I'm noticing there's a trend in the way you type and the way sockpuppets are typing that it's clear they belong to you. You just made yet ANOTHER account to get around the block. Get a fucking life.
---
I've thought about it! It's such a cool looking class, but having to swap hotbars so much kinda frightens me, I might give it a go anyways though!
---
Sword + Dagger Weaver has a fun rotation once you get the hang of it :)
---
I enjoy the idea of it a lot, raising your Skyscale from birth to maturity and then teaching it how to fly is a great concept.  Some of the collections could be a little dense though.  Definitely didn't feel like I needed to go to 28 different locations just to 'teach' it how to fly.  There's also a lot of over-lap of locations and stuff for different parts of the collection (like Augury Rock) and it's a little frustrating you can't get it all done at that spot at once.  
---
Overall though I had fun with it, but i'm not the kind to stress over having to wait a little bit to get charged quartz or map currencies.
---
They should just have the rock close immediately and reopen after doppelganger is killed. But I think it's probably too late for any major changes to the meta.
---
On the plus side, I have been using that wait to get bounties done. It gives people something to do.
---
Oh, I thought you were talking about "they still haven't added a PvE Legendary Armor set that doesn't require raiding," because they still haven't added a PvE Legendary Armor set that doesn't require raiding. The dye channels are peanuts by comparison.
---
Just to update you they looked into it again and I got them refunded!!!
---
Does SW drop the boxes? It's not mentioned on that timer page.
---
it literally is. That project is considered finished shipped, what few changes were made happened simply because Paul was driving them. You think someone will take over this, two years any new developments, with Anet never even acknowledging this as an issue? I almost envy your naivety.
---
you think people don't annoy devs already though?
---
Re-skinning your PvE legendary armor is a right of passage at this point.
---
Except that's not really an issue... Like, literally nobody is complaining about this.
---
Only stupid ppl watch TV .
---
Same as your points
---
I just got mine manually refunded. Honestly just a bad GM. Seems everyone who initially got this guy was shut down.
---
Not *literally. . .*
---
I disagree. You certainly *can* if you're one of those people who enjoys constant stimulation from multiple sources, and that's totally fine if you just *prefer* that. But IMO, if you find something so boring that you think it *requires* other entertainment alongside it, you're probably engaging in the wrong leisure activity. Why are you even bothering to do something that bores you so much that you can't stand it without also doing other things at the same time?
---
I occasionally play music in the background, softly, but that's all. I like being immersed in my game.

I got this just through doing personal story, so yes

Did they basically just show us all the bosses? I really hope one isn't a reskin of cairn..like CA is thematically too similar to KC.

---
It's not so bad if you ease yourself into it. You can go pretty far playing a fresh air tempest that just swaps between air and fire. Mix in earth and water when you feel comfortable. Then start tossing in conjures.
---
I'd also suggest marauder gear to start rather than berserker. Ele's squishiness can be tough to deal with.
---
There is, as long as there is the same amount of rewards in the wing as a normal wing in addition to the 'event rewards'.
---
As a person who works in hospitality/service...I have no clue what you're trying to say.  Do you mean that a busy time is a great time to be terrible your staff, or that it's a great time to take advantage of the business?  Either way, you're a horrible person who should be immediately banned from all decent establishments.
---
Go to the maps that have the most frequent events with lots of enemy waves that drop volatile magic, and bring a profession that can both tag when there's lots of players, and quickly solo events with waves of enemies.
---
I recommend using the crafting calculator on gw2efficiency.com.
---
To be honest, i’m kind excited because we’ll finally be able to see what the branded are truly capable of.
---
As other junky idea that should have been dropped in the bin. Anet is trying but not hard enough.  How about more player design contests?
---
I have my graphics set so low all I see are red circles on a minecraft server, and yours still runs better than mine lol
---
There's no point to repeatedly complaining when no action is being taken, that doesn't mean that there aren't a large number of people who continue to be upset about it. Until this thread, nobody was complaining about the armors' dye channels either.
---
I can semi agree with the sentiment of that, yet for older gamers such as myself (a single father of three) and my friend the feasibility of clearing most content in the same amount of time it takes to watch a lengthy movie is tantalizing to say the least. I would say that there are MMO's out there for the more hardcore audience, but the reality is that is not the case. The reason, I would posit, is because the casual gamer makes up for the majority of the market - and markets tend to follow the money.
---
 I am not that deep into the game, about to hit level 80 tonight, so I cannot speak to the difficulty of the Actual Game, but from what I have thus far experienced, GW2 is a game that *respects* the time I have invested in it. I *can* die in PvE, unlike modern WoW with regards to leveling, and there is a taste of content for every niche, exploration, market manipulators (remember the auction house in WoW? Hasn't been relevant for a *decade*) dungeoneers/raiders with fractals, and a fun world to bounce around in. 
---
For me, the casual, GW2 is the quintessential MMO and one which I am happen to settle down in and call home.   
---
TL;DR:  
---
I respectfully disagree with but understand your position on this matter.

Hi-Res character textures do not work with 2-core processors.

They already give AP for being picked as the Doppleganger.
---
For centaurs, naga, forgotten and other non-humanoid body shapes, the problem isn't clipping, but having to redo armor parts for them.
---
It's easier to slightly adjust charr armor to match tengu than making new pieces for hooves romps, tails and slithering bodies.
