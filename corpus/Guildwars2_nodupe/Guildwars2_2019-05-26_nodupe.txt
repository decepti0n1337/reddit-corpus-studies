The response from the ESA at the end is the big news in the article.  This bill will quite obviously not become law, but it has ruffled enough feathers to get a real conversation started.

---
Charr dont raise their young though.
---
I hopped o to dragonfall. There are so many events you can do and for me at least it is also the only lws 4 map that i wasnt sick of farming by that point in time. If you are lucky, you get to tag 3-4 events at the same time because they happen to bump into each other and spawn mobs on the same spot.
---
Thats not a lie.
---
Regarding Joko, his ability isn't unique among dragons. You can't kill an elder dragon by bombarding it. This was evident in most recent patch, where pact bombardment did nothing to Kralkatorrik. It was also evident in  HoT where Mordremoth kept regrowing. Zhaitan was an exception, but not entirely so. Hear me out: You don't kill a dragon. You move its magic around.
---
...back when GW had an awesome story and fresh gameplay mechanics...
---
Well... there is a good chunk of skill involved with every class in gw2. The difference between a beginner and an experienced player can add up quite significantly in dmg and survivability despite both wearing the same gear. With so less information it is impossible to say what you are doing wrong. So the most important part regarding your problem is: A longbow autoattack will deal more dmg the further you are away from an enemy (that is the reason why many group oriented builds - where you have to stack closely - are not in favor of a longbow). But if you are wearing full berserker - like stated by your post - than a single rapid fire opener + pet attack (F2) should annihilate normal, non veteran enemies. Especially if you are combining this with utilities like "sic' em", "quickening zephyr" or "strengh of the pack"
---
How is the value of death ruined? Plenty of characters have died for realsies, Aurene is an exception and had a very obvious setup for her resurrection
---
There was an achievement to get kill by Deathwing when he would randomly go to a zone and fly in a line of death. I got it by accident but laugh for a good while.
---
Honestly, we wouldn't have to worry about this shit if PARENTS WOULD FUCKING SUPERVISE THEIR CHILDREN ONLINE!
---
Black lion chests are bad, i'd rather just pay for what I want then get fucked by blind boxes, same with the mounts. I see no downsides.
---
Same, I was counting more than 2400 followers when I got tired :\
---
I finished tonight.

---
There are both frustrating and redeeming aspects to these collections.  It *definitely* feels like ArenaNet could have and probably should have trimmed these down before player consumption.  Some feel bloated and excessive.  **"Immersion,"** is something that varies from player to player, and what this collection left me with wasn't triumph or satisfaction.  
---
It was both mental and emotional exhaustion accompanied by a sense of relief.  
---
I think I'm going to go double-check and make sure I didn't unlock another collection ^/s (Kidding). 
---
I don't see myself being able to do this again for LS5 unless ArenaNet can find a better, more rewarding way to break these sorts of collections into more digestible bits and pieces.  The reward for finishing a collection shouldn't be another collection.  You should get *something;* a title, a mini, a temporary Skyscale... some sort of incremental progression that encourages further progress. 
---
I think my greatest issue with this collection is that for a game that prides itself on movement you're not actually doing anything with the Skyscale itself until the *absolute,* bitter-sweet end of what is probably at least a 20-30 hour collection.  That's a little soul-crushing because you don't even really have the opportunity to get to know the mount in-terms of functionality &amp; gameplay! 
---
I genuinely liked Saving Skyscales and Troublesome Skyscales, but 28 Rifts, at the very end? What the !@#$ Anet?  
---
I can laugh about it a little bit, and I really do enjoy having a flying mount, but I'm kind of traumatized.  I did most of my currency progression for the Saddle via Tekkit's Tac0 markers; earning about 30-40 currency a day.  Inscribed Shards &amp; Mistonium took me the longest, and I definitely did grind it out at one of the hearts towards the end, but not *nearly* as much as most people.
---
oh, cool. I wonder if skyscale will have a similar impact, even though it's a smaller scale thing.
---
Weird opinion incoming, but one of my fav things about gw2 is the gem store. I’ve spent probably close to $500 on pretty things that make me happy. I don’t buy BL keys or the mount adoptions because I don’t like uncertainty. I buy specific things, like mount selections, outfits, chaos gloves, and I convert gems to gold to buy pretty things off the TP. With WoW I spent $180 a year to login. With the gem store I’m acquiring BEAUTIFUL art assets that bring me joy. With gw2 I know exactly where my money went and I’m supporting future development of future gem store surprises. 
---
But BL chests, yeah I could live without those, I have zero interest
---
it had sound? i was watching it without it.
---
Nobody knows it yet.
---
It takes more time when there's a combination of a big sale and a new release, which is the case right now. But they should get back to you fairly soon. It shouldn't take too much longer. 
---
Obviously the most information you provided the easier it is for them to determine it's your account. Whatever you do, only update your existing ticket. If you make a new ticket you end up back at the end of the line.
---
Just an editorial from a novice member; not something worth taking seriously.  Author has no clout with MMORPG and is just using it as a pedestal to complain.
---
I liked the part where the music was god awful.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Thank you, I was shooting for delightful so I'm glad I got that down
---
Here we go again with the omega brains and their favorite argument.
---
"It's not pay-to-win, it's pay-for-convenience / pay-to-skip / it's not even pay-to-win (it is)."
---
Read the FAQ for a better understanding of how they defined pay-to-win.

---
*inhale*
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Thanks. While I personally didn’t mind it, I can see that the time gating could be iffy for people and I’m glad they’re addressing it.
---
But the collections themselves are relatively easy to do imo, and decently balanced for a prestige feature that isn’t a requirement for current or future content. 
---
I’ve genuinely seen people give up after getting 25 pieces of a map currency and hurling insults at anet left and right about how big of a grind or how expensive the mount is in map chat ( funnily enough some of them had griffons ).
---
after a really smooth T4 fractal run last night i told the host "i'ma add you" and he said
---
"does that mean.... we're friends?" lmao
---
I think near the fractals portal.
---
I am making good progress on getting my third map done which is Kourna and I should be done with it by Monday. Before I move on does Istan have any POI locked behind events or metas?
---
I know Thunderhead has at least one which is Hammer’s Hoard but I’ve heard that you can get the POI without going into the room itself. Is that true?
---
Dragonsfall is the other map on my list but from what I remember, I could complete the map without doing any events.
---
I finished my skyscale 2 days ago
---
Got burned out and haven’t played since...
---
Well done Anet lol
---
Swimmer should’ve had an underwater option
---
Shit people don't like it when their shit actions have shit consequences.  Who knew?
---
I should start out by saying I haven't read the bill yet, and it is subject to a lot of changes before it sees a vote...  
---
Does this bill also attempt to account for loot boxes being used as ways to sell a product without a set price?  Because that's one of the practices being demonstrated by our own Black Lion Chests.  
---
That Branded Relic skin in the BL chest right now being an example.  I'd flinch at an 800 gem price tag on it, but by putting it into a "loot box" they remove the price tag and turn the "gamble" into a situation where the price isn't determined until you receive the item.  This item and others like it are NOT required to progress in a "meaningful way" in that this item will not enhance your character's effectiveness during play.  Again, not having read the bill, on the surface this type of thing may not be getting mentioned at the moment.  
---
The legal waters are further muddied by putting BL keys as drops in game as rewards for both content and the super-rare mob drop.  And still further by the player's ability to purchase gems with gold farmed in game.  These types of practices have to be addressed too because lawyers will not hesitate to navigate their company's money train right through every hole present in the entire set of laws that touch on this subject.  
---
This isn't going to be something that gets fixed by the passing of 1 bill.  That said, it's good that the conversation has at least reached the attention of US lawmakers.
---
Agree, just provide as much information you have, as said above it will make the support investigation faster.
---
I had same issue with guild wars 1 account and it took about less than 24 hours, the good thing, I had an email from 2006 with information that was helpful when I attached it. 
---
Wish you all the best of luck ^^
---
I enjoy ESO for many things, but the combat is not one of them.  In fact... everything BUT the combat.  It LOOKS like it takes inspiration from systems like GW2, but it ends up being nothing like it and feels just bad to play.  It's slower and less action focused, Dodge never feels good, and the classes rely so heavily on weapon skills that each role feels about the same no matter what class you are on, which makes the class choice itself feel meaningless and the class identity feel bland.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GW2 doesn't have better graphics, and I like the more grounded overall art direction of ESO for its weapons and armor styles, and in general the world itself.  The character models in ESO all have scoliosis and the faces mostly look terrible, though, so I'll take the character creator in GW2 ANY day.  And the skill and mount animations in GW2 are just so much above and beyond anything ESO, or even MOST other MMOs have to offer.
---
I also agree with another poster in that ESO's crown store prices are absurd.  Everything else is pretty good, though.
---
Tip 4: stop holding space to forward to ascend faster because you’ll end up sticking to the wall. Just space is enough.
---
Tip 5: you can spam the dodge key when you see several volatile magic. Skyscale is the mount that gains the most mileage from collecting volatile.
---
The worst thing about BDO I think is in fact that the combat IS so fantastic.  Like... no matter how good the combat should be, it always feels wasted because the enemy AI is DUMB and pretty much just stands there while you hit it.  It only ever feels satisfying to use when fighting other players, and I hate PvP.  Somehow the big flashy fun combat contrasting with the appallingly dull enemies makes the game somehow feel worse to me than if it had had generic combat with that same AI.
---
And this time, where she posted a full explanation of the decisions made around the story? 
---
Come on, you know that is not true at all. She actively used it as a channel of communication with the community.
---
You're the only whiny child in the whole internet. Congrats!
---
...or are you?
---
They don't have big metas, so they don't need a ton of players, and they're still useful for ascended trinkets.
---
If you've been gone from the game for awhile, sometimes they block your account from buying gems (until you contact support) to prevent fraud.
---
Maybe that's what happening here, but a few others have mentioned trouble buying gems so it could be a bigger issue (or just lots of people returning at the same time).
---
Also, you might check with your bank to make sure they didn't block the transaction.
---
I mostly ment the block list
---
Scrappers can convert up to 3+3 condis per second, purge gyro carries on whilst activated, med kit 3 can convert whilst not being in med kit, it's only elixir gun that you have to stay in to actually cleanse condis. So that's that argument done. Not even going to mention the mandatory 1 firebrand per party.
---
Also using cherry picked videos where everything goes right for you (i.e. freecasting) is not proof, it just shows you're up against incompetent/outnumbered enemies.
---
And also no thank you for running the build myself, I already have my hand full trying to get people on my server to play proper builds/classes to have a fighting chance. If I go condi it just means we get 1 pushed by ruins of surmia in 3 seconds rather than 5.
---
As long as you enjoy doing it, it's an effective time sink.
---
Yea I’m gonna check my transaction history for my bank as well to see if something got blocked. If I get nothing there then yea Anet might’ve blocked me from gem purchase due to the hiatus. My suspicion for a block is the fact that I didn’t even get a receipt saying the purchase went through after pushing the button.
---
It used to be the only sure-fire way to get rare gear drops. With new content constantly coming in and introducing more and more efficient methods, world bosses now are done mostly for achievements and unique drops (ascended gear or unique items needed for certain collections) or when u wanna turn off ur brain and chill in the game. Haha
---
Disclaimer: you only get ascended drops from tequatl and triple trouble wurms. (limiting discussion to core tyria world bosses)
---
Depends on the thing. When in doubt, check the wiki and see if it's used for anything. Of the things you mentioned, most can be trashed, but the Spiritwood Scion is very valuable and useful, so don't trash it.
---
Jesus put up a spoiler thing
---
This is because the bubbles are immediately interrupted before anyone can see
---
Nope.
---
This is all I ever want. Most of the animations are already made.
---
Conveniently ignoring AP and class requirements for dungeon pugs even in the early vanilla days. This game was never "play how you want" in pug group content.
---
Raids and Fractals.
---
&gt;Removing them is 100% not the answer.
---
Say that to the censored human female idles.
---
I mean you could raid for one. Fractals are fun as well.
---
Maybe a title called “Pancaked” XD
---
Flat like a pancake
---
We have a secret furry RP community in Southsun beach park.  Look for a half naked human Thief sitting with a female charr Guardian at the bar, and PM me "It's a fine day, m'lad" to join.
---
PvP is only broken to the people who don’t know how to adapt their build to different comps.
---
The strings clip through breasts and there are no arrows before they're shot. Games a decade older could at least show an arrow being ready.
---
He said he was permanently shutting down his higher functions, presumably to avoid that exact scenario.
---
Not only those two. Those two are just  the only ones with some sort of unique skin.
---
It is for me at least. I have a weekly habit of going to HoT maps on low level toons (less than level 10) for key farm levelling. I would do adventures for instant level and one that I like to do is the Ley Line Run. The fastest way to get there from starting WP of TD is by gliding to the Great Tree, which I can't do because the snipers are aggressive to low-level toons and they one-shot me.
---
Character models are going to be the big ones. Most of the time I keep amount and quality on low, but for anything big put them both on lowest. I turned off shadows cause they just look bad unless they are maxed out, and that's about all you can do you help things.
---
For content where I want the game to be as responsive as possible, I'll just turn everything to low and turn up animations and textures. This won't really get you much more FPS on a modern system, but the game will be a little bit more responsive so it won't feel as bad.
---
There's also things like DX12 proxy which seem to help a little bit, but from my experience it's not a massive help. I noticed lots of visual bugs when using it, and couldn't get it working 100%, so I uninstalled. I think there's also one for Vulkan too. Might want to give one of those a shot, cause I did notice better frame time with DX12 proxy, but I'm not sure if it was actually helping, or just it was running better because so many things weren't actually loading for me.
---
sure, for 5s with mk3+purge+fumigate. then they have no cleansing while a dh has plenty more CDs to apply burning. why on earth would you think that's a valid argument? lmao
---
     
---
Those were all clips from yesterday, so that's a lot of luck you're implying. tbh, no one sees a dh on the sidelines and thinks OMG NEED TO KILL IT. weaver has lightning flash and twist of fate while dh brings f3 x2, elite invuln, focus 5, shelter or litany, and wall of reflection for damage mitigation. It's absurdly easy to stay alive, no need to cherry pick =D
---
       
---
Why would you want to use this as a comp build? no one runs weaver in comp anymore, they're just happy if a good one happens to join the squad. This build fills the same role with comparable damage and better group utility. If you can't see that, i don't know what to tell you other than enjoying screaming 'BUT BURNS R BAD' while other people play it lol
---
when do we think the next character slot sale will be?
---
Are you asking 'Why does everyone like the greatsword ON WARRIORS' or in general?
---
I'm a little surprised, but there really wasn't any time. Any searching we'd be able to do would have happened after the big boss fight, at which point there was some pretty heavy magical stuff going on. The most logical place to cover it is in an epilogue, either next episode, or in a mid-episode mini-story like the Caithe conversation after e4. I really hope they get around to it instead of leaving it hanging like some other plot threads.
---
Getting people into other gamemodes is the point. It's working as intended.
---
Thanks for replying! I got lucky and one guy that I was doing fractals with had an alt placed there and I did it. Thanks anyway !!
---
Raids are amazing, GW2 invented M+ and they’re called Fractals, and WvW is great too!!
---
Have you unlocked all your elite specializations? Have you finished all the masteries? Masteries offer fun benefits, for example autoloot, gliders, etc
---
Something to work toward? Legendary armor and gear!!
---
Nah cuz sksycale is the subject of discussion rn so it makes sense he be the better one in the meme.. at least it makes sense in my head
---
Maybe run elementalist for staff 3 switch focus 4 5 and use stealth from consumables.
---
Maybe I missed it in your theory, but if all Skyscales are female, how are Skyscale eggs showing up in Dragonfall?
---
I'd say during the anniversary sale in August
---
The thing is, not having a clear end game is what some of us like about this game. This game is, for a lot of people, about acquiring skins. Find the skins you like, figure out how to get them and work towards what you want. Same with anything else. I collect endless tonics, some people go for infusions. 
---
The point is here you get to choose a goal. As long as you can do that, you'll keep playing. There's nothing you have to have...but there are things that are cool to have. Here you get to pick what that cool stuff is.
---
I got It lol
---
"Time sink" isn't the definition of an hobby...
---
But most people enjoy Open World PvE in GW2 because of how they can achieve something with other players. Being part of something that was achieve has a group feel rewarding. 
---
Sure the loots might be a reason but let be honest, we didnt play GW2 because we want to get loots.
---
Typically games or movies will apply some obvious audio effects to get across the point that it's telepathy.
---
yeah i was speaking to before the other dragon magics binded with him
---
isn't being able to hover indefinitely the whole point of the skyscale?
---
That's what I was trying to get at but was having a brain fart.  If the reverb was cut down a bit this would be pretty great.
---
I mean, the same could be said for browsing reddit and yet here we are...
---
should have been the bunny instead of the griffon but lolol
---
Branded griffon skin from the Branded mount skins pack, dyed with celestial and enamelled perseverance dyes. :)
---
I didn't need to wait 72 hours to get the process started, but it IS a process. Probably just a combination of the timing right now, and looking at your account. I had a pretty good experience with them, recovering my account.
---
I had no idea you could do this. Thank you!
---
Chronomancer for mesmer has basically the best heal in game and is the closest thing we have to a traditional tank, plus provides tons of alacrity, which makes cooldowns tick down 25% faster. I dont have experience in PvP, but a lot of their difficulty in PvE is in clone management.
---
As far as engi goes, I see plenty of holomancers in PvE, and I hear scrapper is quite broken (good) in PvP. I'm not sure why they would be considered "unviable".
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Or one section for each of those things that shows all the LFGs in all of them (e.g. you pick HoT, it shows all the LFG group listings in VB, AB, TD and DS) and then subsections for those individual maps if you want to exclude everything that isn't (for example) AB.
---
That's... actually alluding to my point entirely.
---
What they define as "pay to win" may not be what gamers consider such, but that wouldn't stop people from trying to take legal action to attack things that actually aren't "pay to win" because it falls under the legal definition all the same (like if, say, EA CEOs decided they could exploit the new legislature to take action against a rival company so they get more profit); or developers pre-emptively dismiss/remove useful things like convenience items because of worry over legal action; or the richer game companies becoming lobbyists to exploit such like oh so many other industries already have done.
---
I may be doomsaying in the end, but given American politics as of the last decade (or since the 70s, at least, tbh), I'm completely unsure whether or not my concern is unfounded.
---
Wiki/youtube/reddit search
---
No. No. There is a lot of data out there . Even if you don't want to search, the very concept of inflation makes you wrong.
---
In 2 days it will be Bitterfrost Frontier for everything.
---
Nothing that skin cant fix.
---
Yeah. It's not like any single map has so many squads active that it needs it's own page. I'd much rather just scroll and see where people are active today.
---
I see, hmm it does sounds like a good idea to create of those, and that explains why most ppl like them 
---
About the engi:
---
They said" not optimal" the reason (if my memory serves me right) it has no real utility/dmg in its most common builds, that's mostly dmg, and the idea is to create synergy, instead of only selfish DPS or sth like that. 
---
Also they wouldn't recommend it as an option, instead warrior, ranger and mesmer are better options. I thought  engi was interesting and stuff, but if it's not desirable in team comps or guild, then I think I'd be a better idea to choose sth more viable, mb a revé? 
---
Also most places also recommend (indirectly) to avoid thief as well.
---
Can’t you rebuy the reward chests that give recipes &amp; essences from Hobbs?
---
Merge gift of battle and gift of exploration, call it gift of boredom and make it achievable from any game mode.
---
You sir, are my favourite person in the world right now and have saved me from quitting guild wars again
---
Thank you so much, yes you're correct he does sell the chests
---
Glad it worked out for you!
---
Base guardian is still okay. Base thief is still pretty good in pvp. But elite specs are basically just stronger than the base classes.
---
1.	"Boring" is subjective.
---
2.	All classes are viable, although some will perform better than others in certain combat scenarios.
---
3.	Elite specializations from both expansions open up the capabilities of each class.
---
4.	End game content usually requires expansions to play, i.e Masteries, new maps etc.
---
5.	 You can enjoy F2P until end game. Again, this is subjective.
---
6.	Game has always been populated. It's doing fine.
---
7.	"Not the most boring class" means some exciting. Something exciting means it's usually dps-oriented. Dps-oriented classes are usually low in armor and health. Risk vs. rewards.
---
8.	And again, all this is subjective.
---
9.	Recommend you get expansions when you decide that this game is actually fun for you.
---
10. Real GW2 experience starts after level 80.
---
See you around in Tyria!
---
i know i sound whiny but i have tried and it get frustrating sometime clicking on 5 links in the wiki to get to the point i wanted then still search in the map without pic.
---
Have they even came out with skins yet? (Been offline for about a year)
---
Try Ayin's site, if that rocks your boat.
---
https://www.ayinmaiden.com/skyscale
---
Mount is less than 2 weeks old. Skins will definitely come after a month or two.
---
I honestly love t
---
Shit like that. It makes the chaos of thr battles around feel more real
---
There's a skyscale megathread here and most guides have pics.
---
The bluish green / metal one is actually called a breakbar. Most mobs can be cc'ed (stunned, knocked down, knocked back, etc.) by any stun ability, but mobs with that secondary bar thats usually blue cannot be stunned or knocked back, etc. Instead, your cc abilities will do breakbar damage and reduce that bar. After reducing it all the way, it will turn red causing the enemy to get stunned for a certain period of time and take increased damage while the breakbar regenerates back to full. The metal one usually means that the breakbar isn't damagable at that moment but usually will become damageable in some time.
---
Most weapons usually have some form of breakbar damage so it doesn't matter if you go power or condition, but usually breakbars are meant to be broken by multiple people working together, although some classes might be able to break them on their own.
---
Also, even if you can't maintain double digits of condis on a target thats fine. Condis just like power have burst in the beginning so if you drop all your damage abilities in the beginning you will get double digits, but might not be able to maintain it.
---
I burst in laughter... clearly environment won ;D
---
Congrats on getting your Skyscale! It truly is a wonderful mount! :)
---
Was one of the big issues I had when I played GW2 an age ago. Always seemed so easy to just die to random shit mobs. Just trying to farm mats through mining was a hellish process.
---
That and the lack of trinity (I enjoy playing healer in mmos) meant that my stay was only ever going to be brief despite how much I loved almost every other aspect of the game.
---
It's easily the most useful mount, and with the ability 1 it's not nearly as slow a getting around as I was afraid it would be.
---
Why not join Raids? Or work on your build/abilities in PVP?   
---
Or earn money to buy a commander tag and become everyone's favorite hero in WvW?   
---
Or save money/work on your crafting to do the legendary weapon things? Or even become the pro-dungeon runner and learn the in and outs of all the dungeons/Fractals. :)
---
Swiss tournaments are in the works.
---
The article and comments underneath it exist on some different plane. I honestly can't believe people can claim to play this game and be so disconnected from reality...
---
I agree. I used mine to climb the tower in Dragon’s Stand. It made the climb quite easily.
---
Ah I just started playing again today so was curious if there where any skins. Thanks!
---
Like others said, go into the pvp lobby and try everything out. You have access to EVERYTHING in the pvp lobby and it makes you lvl 80 👏
---
She was injured and put in a state like comatose. It was ASSUMED she died and that's what they WANTED you to assume as well.
---
Should also work like a filter. Like hitting LFG should show all groups, open world should show all open world groups etc.
---
&gt; And trying to send more than 2 mails gets you blocked for spam, even if one of those two attempts didn't even include a recipient.
---
You just have to wair 30 seconds after 2 mails -&gt; no spam block, no problem.
---
that's what i just agreed was going to happen.
---
"When you know the answer to the question before your teacher is done asking it"
---
I remember this, just casually leveling an alt them EVERYTHING IS FIRE!
---
Laughing because games like Runescape back in the day have a better friend/block system than gw2... oh lords.
---
Daredevil is always recommended to people to want mobile classes, its also often recommended as a very good open world or lazy player build because of how you can play it by spamming dodge and staff leaps.
---
I almost never see anyone saying its bad, why do you have that impression?
---
People arent referring to the story itself oer say. Prophecies was the weakest of the campaigns tbh. But the lore, particularly from Factions on was prime. Even the story itself wasnt bad, tho it was a little annoying. But GW2 just feels like its pretending to have depth; the theme park feel. They didnt bring anything that they succeeded in to GW2 which is the core problem. Skills are mundane and of scarce amount compared to GW1 and they're trying to fix it with elite professions (why not keep the old skill bar with the new mechanics?). The lore was all thrown out the window (Gods disappeared, no other continents, Suddenly dagons albeit previewed in EoTN, no UW, no polymock, no faction warfare that defined territory, random new classes with no really similarity to their older counter parts,  etc...). Yeah maybe the story got upgraded to Disney level cliche but the rest kinda went to shit.
---
I don't blame him entirely...
---
I never understood opening up the follower tab and wondering who are these people? Why did they add me? Why can't I remove them? Is this a stalker list?
---
Also the dumb feature that lets you block people and you can still trash talk them but they can't whisper back... how backwards is that.
---
Perhaps I'm simply only seeing a small minority circlejerking something, but both within the forums and my guild's Discord, I see many people saying that in almost all scenarios core thief is better and if you're looking for DPS, run Deadeye.

Does borderless windowed mode still trap the cursor? I haven't had a second monitor in ages, but that used to work for me in other games.

&gt;it get frustrating sometime clicking on 5 links in the wiki to get to the point i wanted then still search in the map without pic.
---
That's what I dislike about wiki too. There are editors in wiki that actively sometimes make this a thing - I've tried to include as much relevant info on some traits I can without overloading it only to be "cleaned up" because "you can click link to link and somehow make connection to this trait".
---
All base classes are good, pick your favourite. I played f2p for a year as a challenge and a sort of solo self found way because you have to create your items like armour. I played a warrior, got full ascended armour and trinkets (except for backpack, which i made an exotic one with infusion slot) and got to max lvl in fractal (which are like endgame dungeons)
---
All base classes are also viable for spvp (arena type pvp) and wvw (Large scale, server vs server war type gamemode)
---
&gt;  but it may make sense in a way that maybe Aurene's fear of death was holding her back. It took her dying for her to lose that fear and unlock her full potential.
---
But she didn't actually get over her fear of death, she just acquired immortality meaning she never actually has to face death.
---
She's didn't grow mentally as a person getting over hear, she just got a new superpower that let her completely bypass it.
---
no borderless doesn't trap cursor, but borderless sucks fps wise...
---
Additions: So apparently for some reason the purchase attempt wasn’t pushed through. GM says they’re looking into it so who knows when I’ll get an update on it. Hopefully tomorrow.
---
Yes, Factions was my favorite by a mile. So much nostalgia...
---
God damn, why are there so many people not understanding how the Skyscale works?! Its fucking awesome!
---
Getting the Skyscale has renewed my interest in the game overall, its so enjoyable traveling and exploring on this thing.
---
It's an interesting choice, but convenient for my desires. Thanks for the info.
---
The torment only manifested AFTER he consumed the other magics though. What about before that?
---
Why is it untrue, its awfully specific if it is.
---
Yeah with the upcoming LS5 it'll soon be a real mess. It's a bit weird Anet didn't foresee this when they updated the LFG.
---
Sub-sections should be a thing so we could split HoT, LS3, PoF, etc.
---
In fact, I'm starting to wonder if it's really relevant to give each map its own section? It's not like maps by themselves were extremely noisy to a point of needing its own category all the time. Palawan happens once per hour and a half (afaik?), some maps never really receive LFG anymore...
---
Except the raids or the squad section, at most we'll see one or two offers at the time. It might be worth just creating an HoT/LS3/PoF/LS4 section in which we could see in brackets the map corresponding to each LFG.
---
"[Auric Basin] - META TARIR" for example.
---
Daredevil is more meta than deadeye and core thief in all game types, you're being misled
---
Download this and enjoy much better performance. But yes, the game horribly needs to be updated.

Just like your comment OOOOH GOTEEM
---
I hate the "Joko magic" handwave, but if they didn't want to extend her death over the course of the next season, then an instarez is the next best option. I saw narrative value in Aurene being dead for a while, so the PC could be the one to bring her back -- maybe by tracking down Aurene in the Mists, hunting down Grenth with a lengthy petition, or hell, even just finding some Eternals with Zafirah and Reforging Aurene. I think the way Anet got it done was a bit of a letdown, but the end result was bits of 3 God Realms in Tyria so I can't argue with the results.
---
happy to hear :) there isn't any rush to get the expansions before 80 anyways (unless you want mounts early) so you're all good there. Feel free to ask any questions on builds or team compositions as well.
---
Well, the whole point of a submarine is to sink.... but not to sink.
---
They're likely looking at Snowcrows benchmark without looking at viability of the class.
---
Rifle Deadeye is not easy to pull off nor practical to pull of in raid and if you were to look slightly down the list, staff daredevil is better than dagger dagger deadeye. As for open world, Rifle Deadeye is able to fire and forget which is fine for open world casual players.
---
Which key is auto run?
---
when ya buttcheek won't stop itching
---
&gt; -the daily treatment. arrange the sections in reverse chronological order.
---
What do you mean?
---
Alright, that's certainly a fair point.
---
Guess I'll check out some other sources.
---
Yeah, I tried DPS Monkey'ing with Deadeye once and figured out that it's a class that needs to be babysitted to the point that it's basically unviable, which is the primary reason I switched to Daredevil.
---
They say that the charr, to this very day, is waiting there for lessons on video editing and recording directly from the PC.
---
&gt; which I think is kinda pointless tbh. 
---
What you're calling pointless was a core feature in one of the most popular MMOs for a good couple of years.
---
MapleStory. Say what you will, it was stupidly popular and successful.
---
&gt; You can’t reply in friend chat because you have a different friend list. 
---
No, you can, you *just reply.*
---
The beauty of this feature is doing that promotes social activity. By replying something like "Yeah, I'll join fractals" lets everyone else know you're doing fractals and encourages others to ask "Hey, *insert-name*, got room for another?"
---
Letting others, who you allow on your friends list so it's an approved degree of publicity, eavesdrop on this chat is a GOOD thing. 
---
This allows you to converse and share stuff about yourself or learn about others without the complicated need to "break the ice" 1-on-1 or fully embrace the often cliquey nature of guilds. 
---
It's anxiety-friendly.
---
And, like any chat, you can tab away to not look at it if you dislike it.
---

It's easy to get, play and does tons of dmg, As a mesmer main, I personally wouldn't bother playing condi in open world.
---
You can change the gear to Assassin's if you got the money to spend but berzerker's is really good. Same goes for runes, eagle is a relatively cheap dps option. You can also run a rune like Traveller's for 25% movement speed. Sigil of Stamina is very important so you can spam mirage cloak in group scenarios. Change utility skills to what you like and find best suites you, I wouldn't replace blink or jaunt as they allow you to escape death at least 4 times.
---
Dodging creates a clone and gives you and your clones mirage cloak. With greatsword this is a great dmg boost and it also tags multiple mobs during events and group scenarios. Killing a mob refills your endurance thanks to Sigil of Stamina. You can target an elite or champion mob during events and just spam your dodge, your clones won't disappear; they and you will hit upto 12 mobs per dodge roll. Try this out in the pvp lobby at the group of golems.
---
Solo: on Greatsword press 4 and 2 and then dodge and most things will die. Use 3 and dodge again if they're still alive. Group up mobs using focus, and use your sword when you see OBSTRUCTED OBSTRUCTED which happens alot in the new map's meta
---
Try to work on diviner's gear when you're done with POF and learn about boon support chrono. If you plan on doing fractals and beyond (Everyone will love you and you will get groups instantly :P)

well fractals is not dead , its just all ppl do t4 now or most of them , pve is active mostly but not so much for ls3 maps
---
It definitely makes sense if a Griffon player feels like the Skyscale is currently out of reach because mom wants you to do chores to maybe, just maybe, get it on your birthday.
---
Lol it's pathetic that by the time I've read your reply some twat downvoted you. Like what, they actually think that WvW commanders *should* be wasting their time accepting/declining dozens of friend requests while they're trying to focus?
---
Depending on what system you are on, it may be easier to Print and then save it as a PDF in the print dialogue.
---
There was one in WoW that you’d get for being killed by Deathwing, who’d randomly torch an entire zone in the world. One for getting hit by debris would be cool
---
I still can't figure out why snowcrows has flame trap instead of viper nest for condition soulbeast shortbow/shortbow, the metabattle build has vipers nest 
---
Can someone explain why flame trap would be better than vipers nest?
---
How much dps loss if I use vipers nest instead?
---
You're wasting your time. Reddit hates Raids and Raiders and think we should be silent in "their" game.
---
No t-pose!
---
Not likely at all since raid wing 7 is still a PoF wing.
---
the execution of her return just felt a little quick. its hard to compare it to endgame and infinity war, but i can say that i wish their was a little more to her return. this could have been the one time in the whole game one of the main characters curses lmao after realizing that aurene is coming back. it just felt a little lackluster/quick
---
Am i the only one who hates the underwater bits?
---
This would be so useful!
---
Daredevil has the most skills allowing it to build % damage on a target quickly, meaning its burst potential for PvE is by far the most consistent in addition to the extra dodge mechanic. This makes it the most forgiving of the three specs to play because missing a dodge on core thief or deadeye very often means instant death. Having constant invulnerability uptime on daredevil means you have more freedom over your utility slots but, more importantly, it means those utility slots can be fitted with damage abilities rather than survival abilities.
---
As a general rule, pulling higher damage number with less risk is better for the entire group because it means the boss dies sooner, thereby limiting the amounts of chances anyone in your group has to get hit and die.
---
Daredevil is the most versatile and powerful of the three specs unless ranged DPS is needed, in which case deadeye pulls ahead in that department.
---
As for the discussions your guild is having, I would imagine any core or deadeye players are tired of the daredevil spec beating them in most situations and gametypes with little room for counterplay or superior builds. Core DD thief is what I've mained since release because I love the dagger playstyle on it, but it requires me to use my shortbow most of the time and then swap to daggers only when it's appropriate to land a fast, heavy burst, and even then my damage numbers aren't going to be as high as a daredevil who's been bouncing on a boss for the entire fight.
---
I would like to see more single target damage and movement/stealth utility given to core DD thief to give it a role vs the superior dodge-spam cousin, but until that happens I'm complacent to swap my melee weapon to staff when I fill a DPS role in squad so I don't get downed as much for the team's sake.
---
They showed some other face modelling for skyscale on guild chat, probably will use those concepts as skins at some point.
---
The fact there's is only 18 achievements total for the 18 achievements meta bothers me quite a lot. Usually you have quite a bit of freedom as to what you want to complete, and I tend to not play the story multiple times. This time if you want to finish the meta you need every story achivement. Kinda bothersome.
---
Only stamina based builds rely heavily on weapon skills tbh. And maybe some super-meta magicka builds but then again most meta builds felt boring to me in both ganes which is why I usually create my own ones.
---
And idk, I've never felt like that about characters in ESO, you can create some pretty cool looking characters.
---
Auora can suck a bag of Kittens with time gates within  time gates within more time gates in a single collection order within a collection of a collection for another time gate collection.. Skyscales are probably 1/3rd as bad
---
Honestly, there aren't any classes that will rule you out of any in-game content in PvE. 
---
Necromancer is known as very solo-friendly. They can get a second health bar, making them hard to take down and can summon minions to attack enemies for you. They're known as being very powerful in open world content but in raids they're a bit hit and miss. 
---
Mesmer has a reputation for being hard to learn, but I think they're really fun. You summon illusions to do damage and take hits for you and people either love or hate them. They also have a secondary focus on teleportation, so they spend a lot of time suddenly being somewhere else. Mesmers are a cornerstone of the end-game with their chronomancer elite support specification.
---
Thief is unique in that it uses action points instead of cooldown timers. You decide how much energy you want to expend to take an enemy down, knowing that if you do too much you might weaken yourself later. They're a very solid DPS class all the way down.
---
&gt; As someone with a long list of followers, please no. It would be very frustrating to have to accept/decline so many of them.
---
Except that's literally not what the poster you answered asked for. He wants a toggle that allows others to become followers. If you have that toggle enabled, exactly nothing changes for you.
---
Depends on fight, but toughness tanking is a thing, and many classes have access to healing as part of boon support now.
---
There's a difference between being seen publically, and broadcasting everything you're doing for everyone who's interested.
---
You just said what I said, his torment overthrew him, by other words.
---
I see. Thank you for the information.
---
I remember I quit playing the game after a...I think it was an early raid boss guy who was teleporting around and oneshotting people. People died left and right, and it was mostly just reviving forever and dying. 
---
It was far from my idea of fun, but I suppose I didn't give the endgame a fair shot beyond that.
---
Yes. Except another enemy shows up. But I think that makes sense. I mean... a huge Island in the territory of the ocean Dragon isn't the best thing in the world I think. Probably he's gonna bw the main enemy in the next Season and / maybe (still in the) DLC. I don't really like jnderwater combat that much, so I hope they come up with something good

Looks like me after drinking 5 Red Bulls right before sitting for finals.
---
If you're happy to use an addon, TaCO is a seperate program that runs and adds an overlay that you follow like a GPS/google maps driving thing. 
---
Look up the bleached bones, dwarven chests, busts of Joko and follow the TaCO paths - you end up absolutely rolling in unidentified gear and trade contracts.
---
Get all the mounts, do raids or fractals or wvw. Craft a legendary, do map completion etc
---
thats what i was trying to say
---
didnt have the time, but i hope it works out
---
I think the easy fix for bridges would be making those events spawn only when you get to them with waypoints. Even if bridge hunters will leave immediately after, you still have time to taxi more players for the meta.
---
The reasons don't really matter in this case, all that matters is we know she has an axe to grind. She also seems to...easily misinterpret things sometimes. (We all make mistakes.) I'm not suggesting she's lying here or anything that serious, just she's not the best source for inside, current information.
---
&gt;  There is another part of me that understands that these companies need money if they want to stay afloat.

A conman needs money if he wants to stay afloat too, would you feel sorry for him too?

It’s the same crap every big company pulls with their slaves
---
Many reasons really: Exclusion of non-payers, obvious progress baiting, denying of Identity representation…   
---
If you want to know more you can Google it or look it up on YT - it's basically a mobile game with an obvious target on Kids and peer pressure
---
All those additional achieves, like skyscale collection, don't count towards meta.
---
Someone said something very smart, about other game, but it works with gw2: "If devs stopped to try develop million things at once and looked at polishing the ones they already have, it would have been a better game"
---
Not quite - it has massive impact on high-end PCs in areas where the game's limitations bring the FPS down to nil.

Those people that volenteered would have made up the required numbers needed to be let go, not added to that number. unsure of the rules in the US, but in the UK you cannot make someone redundant and then rehire for their role until after a certain period and 3 months seems quite short.
---
This would make sense and be funny if they were actually similar, but they're really not. It seems that people who think this really don't have any idea of the differences between the two and are unable to grasp how mounts work in the game. But hey, might as well appease the ignorant mob for fake internet points, right? :)

My game doesn't launch anymore after installing this..

Well I was going to suggest this site, but looks like they have chucked it in as well. - http://leadexample.net/index.html

Yes, this is long overdue. Like 90% of the categories are in Open World. which kind of defeats the purpose of categories in the first place.

Power guardian does well with greatsword and scepter/focus. You can also run sword/focus for less DPS but more utility with sword's teleport. You can see some example builds here for [open world](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Greatsword) and [dungeons](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Power_DPS).

Hi, I played this when it first came out and I am thinking of picking it up again. How is the population now? And where should I start?

Explore other game modes. I explored WvW and PVP, which can be enjoyed to some extent by those looking at what other things the game can provide.
---
Just a quick Tipp! Try to always complete your dailies :) Takes less than 15mins and always nets you a total of 2g^^
---
DD being inferior to Core Thief? Oo
---
Actually those souls returning from Mists were pretty solid showcase how much is in stakes....as they would be devoured permanently if the fight would be lost, despite being living or dead.
---
An underwater expansion without massive tweaks would be a disaster. It would be like the Oculus from Wrath of the Lich King, but as an entire expansion.
---
I see it like this:
---
* Open World
---
** Organized Events
---
** World Bosses
---
** Central Tyria
---
** Heart of Thorns regions
---
** Path of Fire regions
---
Also remove: mentoring, achievements and festivals from LFG Tab.

and a content dev for you is someone who makes loading screen art? you must be...an interesting person. What you described right now, even tho not the best kind, but at least is still content... you’re an idiot.

xD

please go ahead and explain to me, since im so dumb, what kind of content does an artist actually do? the one you stare and press F at?

My skyscale has some visual bugs when I use this add-on.

Is this normal? Is there anyway to fix it?
---
Thank you, I really appreciate your advise :)
---
Thank you very much for your advice
---
It makes perfect sense to me :)
---
Just to make sure you understand this. F2P in this game is more of a extended trial were you are free to try out the core game for as long as you want. The core game have some endgame content but in the end if you really like that game expansions will be something you want to have. It changes everything and ad so much more. 
---
GW2 do not have any sort of monthly fee/vip/patron/whateverotherscallit and have always been a B2P game. Once you have it you own it and can play what you bought for ever.
---
And adding Group counters to it would make that even more so
---
I don't like the look of the skyscale at all and why i have not been in a hurry to get it so far. I guess when there are skins out this might change my mind but for now i just get sore eyes by looking at it and thinking meh.... not now.... 
---
Mind though this is just my personal feeling. There are tons of players who love it and i don't have any opinion about that. This is just me.
---
The end scene doesn't give us a sense of what's left actually.
---
We get teleported/lifted to a high up melandru domain plateau and she flies off, giving us no view of what happened to Kralkatorrik's body. It's all up in the air.
---
You can get ascended drops from anything that can drop level 80 exotics, which is now anything that can drop rare unidentified gear.
---
It's so damn rare you hardly ever see it happening, but getting a Tequatl's hoard is likely just a bit less rare anyways.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Commander%27s_Wings_of_War
---
Nobody knows.
---
My guess is that it's S5 currency. It's likely in early stages of development, so it uses the icon of a tuning crystal instead an unique icon.  
---
It probably slipped to the Live version of the game by accident and it's not meant to be see by players. But since it's still tagged "Dev only" we can't see name or description.
---
A public channel of communication is not a private account by definition.
---
Commander's gear is great if you're tanking, while Diviner's is good for when you're not (but still supporting). So your gear is still valid, just now limited to tank Chrono instead of any Chrono role/builds.
---
In PvP it is.
---
Or you are really young or your dad is an old gamer... I am 25yo and I have the same collection, including the GW2:PoF
---
No, Kralkatorrik's body could also just be reduced in size. You're oversimplifying.
---
Dwarves like griffons, but they do not like dragons. 
---
Ask Falstad Wildhammer.
---
Population is great, the megaserver system means that all maps are pretty populated and never feel empty. I constantly see new (and old, since down scaling is a thing) players all over the central map and lower level zones. The wiki has some good resources for new players [in the sidebar
---
](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers) and there are many guides out like /u/Gulbasaur's [guide here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Gulbasaur/Things_I_Wish_Someone_Told_Me_-_A_new_player_guide) or [mine here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here). In general I just suggest starting a new character and exploring the game then if you have any questions just check out the guides or come back here. My one main tip for new players though is to not get hung up on doing hearts, GW2 doesn't have any "quests" so just do what you find interesting.
---
I’ve farmed the crap out of LS4 maps for skyscale and I honestly started loving them. Which of the LS4 is considered the ”Bitterfrost frontier” map? The one that has basically the best ascended gear for the currency.
---
&gt;Why wasn't the Bloodstone magic part of his Torment? Fire, War, Madness, Root, Shadow, Death Magics, but not the Bloodstone... 
---
Bloodstone magic isn't really so much of a type of magic, as a way of storing magic in general. And the magic that came from the shattered bloodstone was accounted for by Balthazar's presence.
---
Wow, nice and elegant! Thank you. Do you recommend power over condi because it's more straightforward, more effective, or both?

God knows they need senior writer to fix the story mess.

SIR, you are under arrest for breaking the NDA.

I really wish Anet hadn't gone with a map each episode. Seeing all these maps and their missed potentials.
---
And you would do the same if you ever had to run the company yourself
---
but griffon is better...
---
LOL
---
you realize the "at home" one is supposed to be worse, yes?
---
On the contrary, he encourages the young Skyscales to test their limits while he makes scientific observations.
---
They're not really known for ascended gear, more unique rewards. Sandswept has some and Thunderhead has ascended Diviner's gear.
---
I mean we could go on a quest yo retrieve him and find out he really is gone as well and build some kind of memorial?
---
I don't believe any such protections exist in America, unless it was specifically written in an agreement.  Washington state is an at will employment state.  Either the employee or company can terminate employment at any reason, and generally don't need a reason to do so.

Its not a lie its an expectation.
---
They have been worked on for over 2 years
---
&gt;  500 break bar damage just with shield 4 and 5
---
350 damage. Knock back is 150 and each 1 second daze is 100.
---
It is not very difficult, but you need to make sure you hit the orbs to reset your barrel roll. I missed a few and i worked out. It is pure fun to cruise around the map :D
---
I believe the Skyscale is a nice addition to the griffon, they both fullfill a different role and i am happy with both.
---
Not hard at all, either don't do the death or make the resurrection take longer and with more effort. And don't make up sob stories as PR.
---
i think there are even longer lines above the tornado
---
I missed a few just on dragonsfall without even using the barrell roll... So only time will tell if it's easier for me 😂
---
"Customary greeting." though I did goof with the mixing of letters.
---
I had this bug while flying my Griffin through Dragonfall. I assumed it was an environmental effect; clearly not!
---
The Commander is going to gather up the branded and any landscape corruption and stuff it all into a giant Asuran blender to make weapons that they will then use to kill off all of the gods when they come back.

If a restaurant shits in your food but it tastes good you don't have to go back. You know it's shit. You don't need the government to stop them. Make them go out of business.

---
You're getting down votes cause people disagree with you. Deal with it.
---
No, it's a lie. Public and private are antonyms. When you are using it as a channel to communicate with the community about the game you know that it is public.
---
A channel you use to make public communications is not a private channel. That is not a matter of expectation or interpretation.

Can’t take it with you.

---
&gt; But now, after revisiting the map with my skyscale, I had absolutely no problem to follow all the flight paths in the air across the whole map, barely missing a node. So I wonder, if those flight paths were actually designed for griffins or skyscales in mind. 
---
Well, the Jahai Bluffs paths are designed for Griffons, which is why they're kind of uneven on height but on average fairly level.
---
The ones in the center area of Dragonfall are 100% Skyscale though, being a completely smooth curve going down and up slowly.
---
I've actually kept every email I've ever gotten from gw2/Anet for (I know it's weird) but for Nostalgic / sentimental reasons. It just reminds me of the good days of coming home from school to play the first beta and roaming around not knowing anything about the game and then racing with my friends to level 80.
---
Ug, I think it's cool he's doing a giveaway but I see him all the time ig and honestly it gets really annoying to see chat and lfg with a bunch of promotions to his twitch.
---
I am so glad that the explanation for why following these lines was so difficult on the griffon was that they were, in fact, designed for a different mount! That looks like a lot of fun!!!
---
As a regular opponent they are easy to deal with, that's true. It's the Mordren Guard Snipers who leave those burning trails on the ground, but that is just basic 'get out of the fire' principle. The sharpshooters suck when you are not looking for a fight, but just doing a long ass glide where you can't afford to lose altitude by going around. That is until you have stealth gliding or mounts, anyways.
---
Someone please add “Intial D” to this
---
The skins are [Etherbound Gauntlets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Etherbound_Gauntlets) and [Etherbound Greaves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Etherbound_Greaves), bought from the gem store.
---
You know, one control change they could make that I think would be quite useful is, "if holding 'jump' when you hit 'dodge,' it causes you to "dodge" upwards as if you were aimed that way." That seems much easier than pointing the camera up or down.
---
chest and pants are not ardent glorious, but instead the t3 variant. gloves and boots are the new gemstore pieces.
---
Nope, not at all. I hope it gets a bit more streamlined in terms of getting flight-juice refilled (especially in maps without floating magic), but i'm having a lot of fun using Lady Flappington to get around.
---
Over how long will this giveaway be?
---
Yeah, I wish I could remove myself from other people's friend list :/ There are some people there that just make me sad to see.
---
2 hours and 55 minutes!
---
There is shitload of loop holes if any law like that exist. Classic is making redundant F&amp;B Director to rehire F&amp;B Manager. Basically paying less and demanding more from the latter. On the surface it is two different roles, in reality nobody know where one ends and other starts.
---
Can we have your stuff?
---
No like... How long will it last xD
---
I used to do this with my griffon, a lot funnier and faster (but also harder to succeed).
---
Does anybody know if back items scale to character height? In other words: if I make my character smaller does my back item stay the same size or scales down?
---
Axe
---
The 32-slot bag collection quest is worth doing if you're there anyway. It's almost all stuff you do just from doing the metas and general Sandswept shenanigans.
---
[Even better, it's a cover of this Jason Derulo song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyG1FG3H6rY)
---
The fun usually ends when you fly towards open rift, as this volatile magic is totally invisible with the rift in background :)
---
simple. he was just doing what Elder Dragons biologically do.
---
Elder Dragons are meant to preserve the balance of magic. too little magic, the world has problems "existing". too much, the world has problems "existing".
---
coincidentally (or maybe ironically?) mortals need magic to exist as well. just the perfect amount of magic permeating through everything and you get modern-day Tyria.
---
killing Glint may have been an act of rebalancing (for all intents and purposes, the races she hid away 10,000 years prior "stole" magic when they fled - including her) with a side of petty revenge.
---
Its for EVERYONE! We do have some sub only but that doesnt even matter with the amount of legendaries and items.
---
If blizzard could do it with wow, anet can and should. A 7 year old game should not run as badly as this
---
OMFG, this. So much.
---
I just want to tell the community to STOP IT with the annoying music in rotation videos. But I'd probably be downvoted for being such a grump.
---
What do I need in order to be able to fly in GW2? (Last played with HoT exp.)
---
Thank you for screens! It was a time saver!

Hey, i can link you the pages from the wiki:

[Griffon Mount, you need Path of Fire](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Griffon_(mount))
---
[Skyscale, newest mount from the current LS.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale)
---
Its kind of a big topic, this should be a fast information for you =)
---
LFG UI and Achievements UI needs rework.
---
 Symbols and texts would be smaller on Achievements UI and Collections tab would get seperate UI.
---
 Some tabs would be removed from LFG UI since they are not that popular or used.
---
See, this is why I don't make the post. **This**
---
You keep getting people just saying "Oh just mute it!!!" as if that were the pooint.
---
Haven't got any noticeable lag lately tho.
---
You talk too much but say nothing at all mate.
---
My collection aswell: https://i.imgur.com/jyZ0ISP.jpg :D
---
They’re already giving stuff away, they just haven’t started the main giveaway. It’ll only get worse once they do.
---
Theyre still giving away thousands. Managing 500 people with 2 people. Its chaotic and its bound to be
---
Happened to me twice. Once like that and once where I was just idle and suddenly couldn't move due to invisible walls followed by that same burning death ._.
---
Don't forget to add annoying music to your guide!
---
That’s it! Thank you!
---
Why are you delaying sword 2 above 50 heat
---
I love that song 😊
---
just you 👀
---
Sorry about your disability, I honestly hope it is nothing serious, glad you are having fun with the class &lt;33
---
To get the skyscale you need to have the Path of Fire expansion (as mentioned above) and ALL LS Season 4 episodes.
---
Just make a tab for each season
---
&gt; Well done Anet lol
---
I would rather say that this is your own fault. I am still doing it and just feeding my Skyscale. I do it at my own pace. If you rush it and get burned out because of it then this isn't really ArenaNet's fault.
---
Holy shit look at that experience
---
I want to ride on the back of a starfish... an undead starfish.
---
The Helmet is the the dhuum skin. Which you can get as a lucky drop from clearing the fight. Buy from the raid merchant for raid currency (takes some weeks to farm), or you can choose a skin from the Challange Mote reward boy after killing the boss on CM.
---
Jesus christ the fucking music.
---
(...and I also didn't really bother with anything related to Sun's Refuge because I didn't care about it.)
---
Hear hear! I already have something that requires that much time investment.  It's called my job.
---
Don't turn off post processing unless it is your personal preference to do so because you dislike seeing the game the way developers intended. The main performance culprits are char models, shadows, reflections and supersampling; post processing isn't anywhere close to them in terms of performance impact.
---
Everyone knows that new accounts and returning players have HUGE hidden MF boost.
---
I don’t get it.
---
I recommend millersund
---
Pretty much yes.
---
Not only you can explore the world together but you can join other players in story instance content.
---
Its totally possible to play in groups.
---
No period
---
Drop 100g worth of rares and exotics into mystic forge each day - you'll be swimming in precursors in no time at all.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Cheers!
---
Literally unplayable**.**
---
I noticed I don't have suns refuge during the skyscale hunts and can't figure out where to get it 😣
---
If you're in a map being used for daily events and such, generally there will be a commander tag somewhere on the map. Right click it and select join squad. If there's only a mentor tag, ask map chat "lfg" or ask while you're at a populated event.
---
Short answer: yep
---
Long answer: yes
---
I think the portal scroll is an achievement reward.
---
Pretty rendition :)
---
The personal instance is within Jahai Bluffs. If you don't have Jahai Bluffs you'll be unable to continue.
---
&gt;necessarily the same as how the majority of people define it.
---
So? A bunch of people define literally as not literally. Just like a bunch of omega brains don't think any of their favorite games are pay-to-win. I read some comments saying warframe isn't P2W so I checked out the wiki and it turns out it is P2W but the fanboys don't want to admit it.
---
Without the Spearmarshal's Plea you can't teleport to the far east end of Vabbi anyway.
---
HoT do the meta VB and AB everyday people are doing it ^^, tangled depth and dragon stand wait when it’s daily ^^
---
PoF bounties for days, also best when it’s the daily.
---
Plus you really need to get LS 3 and 4 and start farming the maps and get ascended trinkets and backpacks ^^
---
&gt; I wasted a minute looking for the point here.
---
I see what you did there.
---
If you have lots of dungeon money and some mystic stones you can throw a bunch of dungeon offhands into the forge and get a few good rolls.
---
Actually ran out of mystic stones before dungeon money and got Howl, Spark, and Tooth of Frostfang
---
It is not an expectation; it is a necessity for ANET
---
Future maps in ascalon and the stretch of elona where kralk traveled down at the conclusion of PoF will probably show the brand slowly breaking down and brandstorms receding depending on when in the timeline the maps are staged.
---
So many years later, I still can't figure out the exact requirements for article use in English. Sometimes it does indeed nuance the sentence, but other times feels outright arbitrary. Maybe if I read more traditional literature from before 2000s, I would've figured some of that out, but I still doubt it...
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sun's_Refuge_Portal_Scroll
---
In Hot i like doing AB and Tangled. It's really... Chilling, I would say.
---
When it comes to pof... Well, hard to say, dragonfall is rally nice and piniata on crystal oasis can be profitable... if you are really lucky.
---
How much VM can you realistically farm this way?
---
Cool mog.
---
Ey! Glad you stuck this up! Seriously - thought hed died!
---
I can't unsee that one is almost alphabetical and the other is order of release.
---
At some point, I don't want to be invested in a story that has been playing out for more than 10 years if its not actually going anywhere. im excited to see the source of elder dragons, im not excited to watch the game come to a conclusion with more questions than it began with
---
Do some bounties and events in pof maps
---
You missed a few
---
Not without aquiring permission.
---
You do realize ARC does not receive any stats from other players, right? It calculates condi uptime by countdown meaning your condi uptime is representative of all your various applications averaged whether they tick fully or not. Given the build is almost entirely 3s duration burns, with a couple of 1s sources, you'd expect it to average really close to 3s.
---
i still think it should be able to glide across the map without descending
---
It will probably grow on me. Just as a dragon lover it was off putting a bit. (Like Mordremoths face did, but he looked more like a Chinese type dragon)
---
They are both alphabetical, but yea
---
&gt;d the Brand in Ascalon territories because he moved from his resting place to where Glint was in order to kill her when she betrayed him (the phrase "I hope you never have to kill what you love" was in reference to her, so he didn't exactly want to do it, it was just to ensure his own survival), not because he wanted to stick it to the races that were there or something.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Zhaitan's magic probably didn't really upset him much nor did Mordremoth's, in fact he was still somewhere in Elona, resting to recover after the fight with Glint and Destiny's Edge. Howe
---
Thanks for your reply! I never mentioned the word "evil" cause I agree with your vision, nevertheless the dialogues in the last istances were a bit ambiguos, seemed like Kralk has some sort of regrets and the torment was almost "controlling" him.
---
Maybe Balthazar's magic was the last drop in the vase
---
The advantage of teleporting to the griffon sanctuary is that it's really high up. Makes it quick and easy to dive on your griffon and get anywhere on the map.
---
Omfg I was wondering why I would recognize a death metal? Song lol. This song brings back every school dance lol
---
That’s how I have been. I know it will grow on me but after tending to Aurene and getting kinda attached to the way she looked it’s been hard.  (Never did like Aurenes snout)
---
Talking about bloodstone fen.
---
&gt;"God magic", which might be different from "Dragon magic"
---
I doubt it is. Even if it is, Balth was stripped from his magic and absorbed a bloodstone and Primordus' magic.
---
you sir are a fucking genius
---
Wow you're even in here not caring about it
---
It would be a very expensiv thing for a-net to get the rights to use that charakter.
---
Always thought they would consume magic untill it ended, than go back sleeping, Not sure that they would nornally simply consume some stuff and then sleep
---
HoT I still replay a lot, PoF I did once and now I'm done with it.
---
Non-PoF, though. There's a shitton more resistance and cleanse in PoF, with Firebrand and Scourge.
---
Haha jokes are fun right? :)
---
How many more expansions do you think gw2 will have? gw1 had 3 and we've had 2.  maybe 1 more?
---
And was countered by 3 antitoxin tempests and CoP feelsStopDropAndRollMan
---
I have the instance just not the scroll.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Lmfao damn
---
The comments are what kill me. I feel like I'm playing a completely different game from these people.
---
While personally I think he ought to be recoverable (it'd be a refreshing change from having so many side characters built up just enough to get you attached and then killed for cheap feelings), I don't necessarily mean that they have to in order to deal with it. The fact remains that we know up until the end that the tracker, and thus at least parts of Blissh, are still functional. It would be stupid of us, or at least of Taimi and Gorrik, *not* to track it down. If he's unrecoverable, so be it, but it's something that just feels off not to address at all in the near future.
---
In natural cycle he would kill all life in tyria and steal their magic and go back to sleep.  
---
It wouldn't be too much magic for him because all elder dragons would take their share.  
---
but taking mordermoth's and zhaitan's share was too much.
---
That's also possible and as far as we know it's all guessing, but we do know magic has different "types" so maybe it's still something Kralk should not have eaten, regardless of what theory is behind it.
---
"inspired by" maybe; but I doubt it.
---
Wait really? What a bizarre setup, I'll have to take a closer look at how that's used properly.
---
Meh, kitless holo is more dead than kit holo is right now. If you want something braindead easy and beginner friendly, play Daredevil with Staff Master instead of Havoc Mastery (and then equip Havoc once you're comfortable with the class). Brings strong CC with basi venom, just like holo shield. Brings better DPS, and can stop and start the rotation a lot more comfortably than holo can.
---
This should have been a skyscale race.
---
When you realize you need to change your major
---
Absolutely. I know more than a handful of open-world commanders who have just stopped either hosting open squads and putting them in LFG, or stopped hosting squads entirely. The game does almost nothing to incentivise people stepping into those leadership positions - except a few tips from generous players.
---
right but they use "to *the* Sandswept Isles" but then ignore it for  "to Jahai Bluffs" and "to Thunderhead Peaks".
---
also, they use "to *the* Domain of.." but not in "to Bitterfrost Frontier".
---
they don't follow any pattern.
---
He's copyrighted and probably expensive to get permission to use.
---
Besides, do we really want GW2 to be another game that is derivative and relies on directly referencing other media for a quick buck?
---
I'm pretty sure the amount of collectable magic is capped though, they will disappear on the whole map at a certain point.
---
I leveled like that in Thunderhead Keep and that was what I observed at least.
---
If you're using a channeled ability, say Whirling Defense and you get boons mid cast do they work on the rest of that ability?
---
It seems to just be a side effect of magic - which the elder dragons have been eating for a very long time, even if some of them recently had their diets expanded.
---
Look at all the bloodstone effects from the last season and all the crazed enemies that spawned. It’s possible you don’t even need to have the magic - just covetinv the magic seems to make people insane. You could include Abaddon in that list, as well as Balthazar, potentially even the game’s namesake, the guild wars which were fought over the bloodstones, could in some way have been caused as a result of this “magic madness”.
---
And the amount of volatile magic you can amass is astounding. That is going to make buying those wood or trophy crates a lot more affordable. Which is good because that new legendary is a huge wood hog.
---
No they're meant to be solo'd.
---
Seems like theyve got a general problem with gems rn.
---
Tried byuing some yesterday, nothing happened.
---
Then I got 2 Keys from a friend who bought me 2 2000Gem cards in a store "but the code could not be redeemed" :/
---
Just a classic rant written by a self-centered person.
---
He's basically saying: "ArenaNet should've tailored the game so that I could do what I like to do and be accepted everywhere."
---
He plays mediocre builds where efficiency makes a difference. On top of that he thinks the game should be made in a way that his mediocre build is actually good everywhere, so that the community doesn't put the blame on him.
---
Want to be casual and play mediocre stuff that you enjoy? Great, you'll have 95% of the content available and you'll be able to go through it with that mediocre build
---
Want to reach the last stages of the game, where you have to fine-tune your build so that it is optimal? Great, then you can successfully go through the rest of the 5% of the game without the community blaming you
---
Everything is soloable, altough I guess that if you lack decent sustain you may have some trouble here and there as you will take damage frequently. And if your gear is truly that bad you might want to upgrade it, just to make your life easier everywhere. Lvl 80 Rares are the bare minimum while exotic is above average already.
---
This is also the reason why you cant find groups for it. The story is perfectly soloable, including the achievements. HoT story is more difficult and has an achievement that requires a group (unless you are really skilled).
---
No kidding. I'm halfway through deforesting Orr again.
---
Well if you got a decent build they are usually very easy even too easy imo. I suggest get to know your class and make a build which focuses on Damage and has some sustain, its really fun to buildcraft your own stuff anyway. Or you can be lazy and go on Metabattle openworld build for your class and copy paste it.
---
What can I tell you, it's not your fault. Core Tyria did everything against you to not prepare you for proper endgame gameplay. Now it's time to start learning the game. On your own, cause the game itself isn't even trying.
---
I was saying that his torment tricked and persuaded him, not that Kralk was controlled or overthrown by his torment.
---
&gt; while kralk has been consuming, killing and branding well before having Zaithan magic inside him.
---
He doesn't. He just created minions and let them gather magic. Since Elder Dragons are natual forces, accusing him for killing is the same so accusing a storm or an earthquake for killing.
---
The only one he killed on purpose was Glint, because she betrayed him. (And those who attacked him)
---
He wasn't.
---
It fell off.
---
Gaile Gray is not a dev, so /shrug. Communication got much healthier now that she's gone.
---
I keep in the bank, take it out, use it, then put it back again before clicking to where I want to go.
---
I can't believe I missed that a DF scroll exists at the Olmakhan vendor.
---
You said he anwsered his torment because of the pain .. I really dont mean what else this means besides succumbing to his torment. Whatever you want to call it, its a fact IMO that Kralk was not able to control himself because of his torments. He said so himself, his torment blinded him.
---
True, but I think that ArenaNet needs to make ghosts "less living". Since Path of Fire, there's been barely a difference between the souls of the deceased and the living in terms of mentality or interaction. If anything, it's an outright boon to be a ghost, since you no longer hunger, need sleep, or age, yet you're able to interact with the world, remember everything about yourself, and make new acquaintances. Not just in Season 4 has this been an issue, but with Dunkoro's group in Lair of the Forgotten, the Primeval Kings in their tomb, or the Ascension ghosts in Augury Rock.
---
I think the ghosts shown in the core areas (and I don't mean the Foefire ghosts) and those of the Seraph and Belinda in Season 2, where they're trapped in the place of their death until they move on to the Mists, or confused and forgetful of their life, was a much better representation of the souls of the dead.
---
Some of the souls in Thunderhead Peaks - mainly those in the dwarven catacombs - do a good show of returning to this, as they return to the world at the place of their death - but not all of them.
---
What pants are those?
---
I mean he was at -2 at the time and it had been 3 hours since he posted it. I also was not complaining, just pointing out how ridiculous it was. But nonetheless, glad you agree with me.
---
I suppose most realistic would be an Elementalist if you like not over the top elemental magic. As a non magic class I guess Ranger since you can play meele and ranged, and the animations are pretty realistic imo. For race either male Norn with the smallest body type or a female Norn but be aware they have the worst VA (not so bad in the expansions tho). Norn females have amazing cultural armor which makes them look realistic and badass. I would also suggest getting into the lore if you want to really enjoy the game since there are so many cool lore pieces in the world and the ambient dialogue. The besz start for that is Woodenpotatoes channel, he did a cool summary of the lore before the game came out. Also suggest turning character model quality on lowest if you dobt wanna see shiny and immersion breaking skins players use.
---
oh really? then why do you think he killed glint before he got magic from zhaitan and mordremoth?
---
he did say to aurene ''I only hope you never have to kill what you love'' referencing the fact that he didn't want to kill glint
---
I really need the T6 mats though and those are way pricier and less farmable.

Cost efficiency. Fired people had huge salaries due to being there for a long time (I'm an outsider so idk why not just take the cuts instead?) while fresh blood would be much cheaper.. Until they spend enough time and get raises and so the cycle goes on.. From my understanding, that's how it works.
---
The fact that vets knew more about the game and were much needed is another topic though.. Fresh blood won't have the same feel and understanding of every aspect and nuance. I'm not enthusiastic about all this. :C
---
I feel the same way as you. I have tried countless times to get into GW2 but I have failed every time. Sadly, not everyone can like [insert any name]. Just try every profession in the game and switch to another game if you don't like anything.
---
If you like your abilities to feel like they have an impact and like/love grinding try Asian MMORPG games like BDO.
---
I wish you the best of luck in your long and hard journey that is finding a main MMO!
---
The basics of that system is already in the game for some Heart Missions, but it'd suck
---
For example: You killed Kralkatorrik, now you can't play the event anymore
---
It's good, but don't come expecting GW1 or anything close to other MMOs. It's different, which is its main appeal and its main drawback.
---
If you're coming expecting to theorycraft, be able to make many builds and enjoy a plethora of instanced content, stay away from this.
---
If you can stomach a more single-player like approach with world exploration as its focus and cosmethics as the endgame, then wellcome.
---
I don't know how popular this idea is in gw2, but IMHO it would be nice to have an instant matchmaking option, when looking for fractals(at your current level), and dungeons. I'm not sure how this could work for fractals, but that would be easy in dimungeos.
---
God forbid people have a life and find a thread that is still in the front page of the sub. I can't tell if you're new to Reddit and just bought that account, but just so you know people will reply at any moment the thread is still visible, even if its 24 hours later, and if you don't want people replying to you the solution is to simply not post at all.
---
Recently hit 10k hours played and tbh I still don't know why that centaur-mob attack in the tutorial is happening.
---
So I'd say "no".
---
But I think this small dragon, that we used to play around with and fry some fish with, recently died?
---
No reason to ignore the hard work people have put into the narrative over the years - in my eyes.
---
destroying the whole world is a bit different than killing all life  
---
because life can somehow come back from the mists
---
That'd be awesome! The player and Aurene with the Branded could easily take over the world! Scarlet 2.0?
---
A skin similar to toothless would fit better the Griffon, since he's a fast flyer.
---
Don't forget mounts do not have to match the race of the original. We have plenty of mounts that look like a different creature or even a different mount.
---
Glad that most people here on Reddit seem to enjoy it. For me it just seems like it was written by a 10 year old.
---
Whooooaaa i did not know that
---
I have a hard time believing that. Some screenshots as a proof would be nice. Post processing effects are predominantly just shaders for color grading, distortions, bloom, blur etc, meaning they affect GPU (very lightly, compared to rendering the rest of the game), not CPU.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't. You *can* do the story together, but progress will be recorded by the person who opened the instance.
---
So.. it depends on what content you're looking at. When the game first came out I loved the core storyline but we're nearing 7 years. Now the narrative cutscenes of two npcs talking on either side of the screen is pretty blah. The lore is nice but after 7 years... The expansion stories I like and the cutscenes are much better. Specifically Eir's major cutscene in HoTs. It was the first (that I remember) major, "graphic" scene in the Guild Wars series. The immersion has really increased over the years.
---
Maybe. We won't know until Anet makes an announcement during or after season 5.
---
When I tested without cover conditions the average duration dropped to &lt;2s with an 80%+ cleanse rate. With cover conditions solo it averages just under the max with a 50% cleanse rate. With a squad and scourges it's almost full durations with a &lt;30% cleanse rate.
---
It seems like arc's working fine in that respect, the numbers I'm getting from it are what I would expect to find for each scenario
---
I still feel the entire social tab could use an overhaul tbh.
---
Do you know about the pvp lobby? You can enter the pvp lobby at any time instantly. Once there you’re scaled up to lvl 80 and you have access to all the abilities and all the gear in the game. You can test every build and examine every spell animation and character movement. Just make a new character and go in the pvp lobby and test everything out. Anet is very thoughtful in this way and the game lets you try everything before you decide!!
---
warning: OP is serial troll who has two other accounts banned here, do not waste too much time writing your answers
---
What top is that?
---
Hmm, elementalist might be a good idea, mages aren't usually my cup of tea but might be fun to try something new. Ranger is the class I've liked the most this time, only problem is they feel like gratswords and longbow are the only fun weapons and by lvl10 you've essentially experienced everything they have to offer since most their utility skills feels kind of bland.
---
Good call on a female, didn't think of that actually, usually just pick males because it's easier to get I to character that way. How is gw2 with female armor though? Skimpy bikinis or armor that might actually be useful?
---
Boy am I glad you posted this, I've been wanting that Kralk theme song for ages now!
---
Nothing and everything is "busy work", it's an MMORPG.
---
You need to gear yourself up. There are more ways to make money than you have time for. I recommend you try out all four HoT metas. Be on time and look for groups. It's recommendable to look up the objectives beforehand. Each map rewards you a Hero's Choice Chest once a day (so four a day in total), the generally desired item from them being Amalgamated gemstone. The rest is standard loot.
---
Look up how Silverwastes works, it'll make you rich in no time if you can stomach the sand. If the resource you pulled up doesn't talk about RIBA, find another guide. Timing isn't as crucial, just hop in and find a group.
---
Look up Domain of Istan, especially Palawadan. It's a LWS4 map, but very low effort place for quick loot.
---
Prices are terrible at the moment, so the earnings guides boast won't be what you'll actually earn, but at least gearing up is also cheap. Go for Exotics, if you're unsure which stats you should pick, pull up a guide. If you're playing GW2 without a guide open, you're probably doing something wrong. /s (but really, the wiki is excellent).
---
Mining iron? Worth it. Chopping Elder Wood? Worth it. Good materials are all over the maps, some maps have good farming spots. Easy gold for barely any work.
---
Fun? That's completely subjective. You'll have to find what clicks with you. You should look into finishing masteries, and you could consider if the remaining three mounts are something you'd enjoy working towards.
---
If the world just doesn't grab you, at some point you need to re-evaluate if this is the game for you. A friendly suggestion by [deleted].

I know some youtuber, I think his name was "Roul SC", that guy always has amazing music

Ya kind of sad since this game seems to have so much casual fun to offer with exploration an everything.
---
Might try BDO out at some point, sort of the last mmo I haven't tried :)
---
The cheapest official retailer is often [DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/search?keywords=guild+wars+2), with each expansion for ~$20usd or both for $38usd.

Next official 1/2 off sale might not be until August for the launch anniversary.
---
If you find a good deal from another region, don't be afraid to go for it.  Codes from any region work in any other region, except China which is its own bubble.
---
I think if they could do it - they would've. The problem with this idea is that skyscale is just a model, not a creature. They had to specifically create an animation that makes the mount fly above the target area and breathe fire. They can't make it fly to an arbitrary location, the animation had to be tailor-made for that specific distance in front of the player.
---
No I did not so thanks for a great suggestion:)
---
[removed]
---
Sure I could, but the visuals is more a problem of getting invested in the character more than just looks.
---
Depending on which race. Norn have more useful armor i would say, while human female casters are very skimpy. Still human female heavy armor classes look simillar to males so in that regard they do look useful. Same goes for medium armor. Also guardian might be for you, it has the most fun animations and skills imo and is very versatile, it has one of the most hard hitting DPS builds but also one o the best SUpport builds. As a DPS you can still support yourself with alot of vrry very useful utilitys. You can summon spirit weapons with them aswell. The only lackluster skills are the Elites imo. And Firebrand gives you literally 3 more weapon bars. You have certain tomes which you read from and cast devastating spells or support your allies. Its my favourite class in the gsme
---
That is a lie. I follow the rules of the subreddit
---
Paying attention to the story is the whole reason I haven't done a goddamn thing in this game. Have to finish the base content before I start HoT, and finish all of that before I start PoF.  
---
There's such a content backlog for me that I just do my dailies and log off because it's essentially insurmountable. I never even finished the base game story.
---
We've been running burn dh, burn fb, and zerker weaver to hit groups while they fight pretty successfully. The burn fb has about the same damage as the dh since dh brings the cover conditions for both. To see when/if the DR becomes an issue we'd need a few more burn dh/fb
---
Basically you swap off cooldown and this way you get 3 procs of the torment sigil for every 10 seconds you spend on that weapon set.
---
I thought it would be Kalk scabs, kinda like how there were mosaic elegies and those went into the wallet for some reason. Would make a little sense if they were planning to use this armor set to upgrade to ascended or legendary
---
If you have the spear marshals plea from griffon collection you can port via that
---
Thank you! Now if only I could find people on lfg to do it lol.
---
Parking alts at Pagga's and using the new AOE harvesting glyph makes that a less painful project.
---
If it were 'Jahain Bluffs' you'd need to use the, because Jahain is an adjective.
---
In Thunderhead Keep, 'thunderhead' is replacing/serving instead of 'the'.
---
I think there's a typo, honestly, especially when looking at the second half of the statement where it says "allows a user to complete an achievement that is no longer available due to timer or too many failed attempts". With that half in mind, where you *must* purchase in order to complete under those circumstances, I really think the intended first half is "assists in completing an achievement that cannot be accomplished without".
---
&gt;Elder Dragons aren't inherently evil, they just don't care for what they destroy while they eat magic and do their thing before going to sleep again. They are just a natural force like an earthquake or tornado. Other living creatures are the equivalent of ants for an Elder Dragon, so they don't really care if they cause havoc while they go get their magic smoothie.
---
This is how Elder Dragons are presented at the very beginning of the story, but this is from the false, uneducated perspective of Tyrians.
---
As we deal more and more with the Elder Dragons, it is increasingly shown that they are fully well aware of the devastation they cause mortals, and some are shown to be doing so very much intentionally.
---
Jormag, for example, actively seeks out to corrupt those whom are willing converts rather than just enslave all who come by him and his forces (the Sons of Svanir are not exactly following this, mind you, as they believe spreading his power to others makes them worthy of being gifted with his power).
---
&gt;Kralkatorrik created the Brand in Ascalon  territories because he moved from his resting place to where Glint was  in order to kill her when she betrayed him (the phrase "I hope you never  have to kill what you love" was in reference to her, so he didn't  exactly want to do it, it was just to ensure his own survival), not  because he wanted to stick it to the races that were there or something.
---
It was more than just to ensure his own survival. The split personality of his Torment drove him to kill her, just as it drove him to want to consume and destroy everything - it promised salvation from the pain caused by the conflicting magics within him (which created the Torment in the first place it seems) once Kralkatorrik had consumed everything he could and destroyed the rest. This would include Glint once she was freed of his control.
---
And as shown in Edge of Destiny, Kralkatorrik was fully aware and intentionally causing the Dragonbrand as he flew south.
---
&gt;Zhaitan's magic probably didn't really upset him much nor did  Mordremoth's, in fact he was still somewhere in Elona, resting to  recover after the fight with Glint and Destiny's Edge. 
---
Except that it was said during last week's Guild Chat that it did make things worse (was even said in the instance). Further, Kralkatorrik didn't move to Elona until after he got Mordremoth's magic. There wasn't much to recover from that fight, either, as Destiny's Edge's entire ploy was aiming for a one-shot kill which they didn't get. They did very little damage to Kralkatorrik overall. Just a few arrows tipped with dragonsblood crystals.
---
&gt; However, Kralkatorrik started behaving erratically shortly after  absorbing Balthazar's magic (he was right next to the source, gulping up  most of it, and it was "God magic", which might be different from  "Dragon magic"), wanting to actively destroy the Mists and Tyria by  devouring how much he could, which is not how the other Elder Dragons  behave at all.  
---
Again false. Glint outright says he was acting this way during the previous dragonrise, and when Snaff entered Kralk's mind in Edge of Destiny, the thought was exactly what we see of Kralk's Torment in Descent: "consume everything, destroy the rest."
---
Kralkatorrik hadn't really acted at all different after consuming Balthazar's magic (which was still Tyrian magic, since Balthazar was stripped of his divine power and regained strength from the Maguuma Bloodstone, Primordus, and Jormag; though the magic Balth took was converted to his own flavor and gave Kralk and Aurene the ability to open rifts into the Mists), he just had more powers like Primordus did in Season 3.
---
 Except mordy did kill people. Belinda, random NPCs, drooburt, etc.
---
Same as WvW Alliances, probably. Still counts as what he was asking for though.
---
I don't get why the combat skill of the skyscale is targeting in front of where you are landing and not at the same location that you get dismounted (like all the others do). It's quite annoying if you land in a small area and see your skyscale burning either a wall or a slope.
---
But I still like my new dragon. :)
---
Most of your skills and traits are core, so it’s best to know all of those first before moving onto elite specs. Most people feel overwhelmed otherwise.
---
Posts like this make me want to never touch PvP.

Great video bro, glad someone is making explanative videos with actual gameplay of underdog builds for the community.

Those poor poor publishers raking in multiple millions are only trying to feed their kids :(

You forget one major thing:
---
It's exploiting the *absolute fuck* out of "won't someone please think of the children!" which is surprisingly powerful and tends to immediately paint any opposition in a greedy-villain sort of light.
---
"This person/organization is against our legislation protecting children! Clearly it's even more important that we vote for it!" etc.
---
you should test it :D
---
It's a retcon basically, but yes the idea is that too much magic corrupts.
---
Yes, but did he do so because he wanted to kill them specifically or because they merely were "in his way" and possibly retailated against him trying to get some sweet sweet magic? Imagine you were having a picnic, would you really care if you killed a few insects that happened to be in the wrong place while you were walking, that tried to get your food or that tried to sting you? Likely not :v
---
Griffon's is equally shitty. Seems to be a trend with flying mounts.
---
That's the worst advice for a new players I've seen on this sub. The last thing a f2p should spend his money on is a niche QoL item.
---
You're assuming GW2 doesn't go back to "you have to purchase the game in order to play it" and doesn't add "oh and now you need a subscription because we have costs that aren't covered by BL boxes anymore".
---
&gt; it would outlaw black lion chests, the random mount liscense and such.
---
**GOOD.**
---
So say getting an ascended from a lvl 1 fractal is the same as getting one from a lvl 100 fractal?
---
Yeah no, they were not merely "natural forces" anymore. That used to be the case but they very clearly have the same sentience as any other intelligent being.
---
I'd be happy enough if at least the attack centered around my target or the closest enemy instead being solely based on the position of the mount.
---
Wait, that's the guy who started his 10 minute gw2 rant video with 2 minutes of telling us about his sex life, right?
---
As part of the lootbox ban, the bill outright bans cosmetics that are part of lootboxes. Only direct-sale cosmetics get an exemption, and only if they are in fact **purely** cosmetic, without any stats or benefits or bonuses that affect gameplay.
---
(Thank you - I think it was buried with the Skyscale stuff!)
---
&gt; GW2 has been more popular than GW1
---
Quarter to quarter GW2 is making what GW1 used to at its peak with barely any microtransactions, except with 5 times more employees.

Oops he just quit again. : ^ )

Indeed. For a build that's pretty old news (it's quite good, but I think it came up a year ago), I'd expect something more than this level of execution.
---
Maybe you're feeling an aftercast from your autoattack?

CDkeys is not approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

But how is it detectable though, all gem keys come from Arena net so how can they know where I got it?

Eh if its legit gemcards then it isnt really bannable in itself but the problem lies within it not being an authorized reseller and a greymarket site so it have been aquired by the seller in an illegal way and that can get you banned if they trace the code.
---
well, I meant specifically for Orr and it's physical appearance.
---
Mate, mate, mate, it's "instance"...sorry just had to tell you.
---
I think part of what makes it weird is that this is the only engage skill where you don't travel with your mount as it executes the move. Instead we just drop down and let it fly forward. Anecdotal, but in my experience, it seems to drop the field about as far as any other mount jumps forward when engaging. The drawbacks here are we can't control it mid cast and it's harder to visualize. So ground targeting would definitely help with that.
---
wait for new release with fix to that
---
Ok thanks I will go check it out
---
Honestly had no idea the tomes worked that way and might actually switch to this now to free up some shared slots.
---
I actually like the fire field. There a few classes that take advantage of things being on fire, not how on fire they are just that they’re burning. Either by doing more damage to things that are on fire or leaping into a fire field, etc. It’s a nice little bonus.
---
What does a Rigger do?

That would just make more things to unfold, not solve the issue.

**Update 6:45pm ET:** CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis of Entertainment Software Association issued this statement in regards to the senators' proposal:
---
&gt;This legislation is flawed and riddled with inaccuracies. It does not reflect how video games work or how our industry strives to deliver innovative and compelling entertainment experiences to our audiences. The impact of this bill would be far-reaching and ultimately prove harmful to the player experience, not to mention the more than 220,000 Americans employed by the video game industry. We encourage the bill's co-sponsors to work with us to raise awareness about the tools and information in place that keep the control of video game play and in-game spending in parents' hands rather than in the government's.

**Get fucked, Stanley!**

The writer for those text boxes was laid off before he got to put that . in there.

Suggestion:

Add a new foldable called "Watch List" on top of the others  
---
Add a checkbox on the left side to add/remove an item to the "Watch List"
---
Aside from the fact that he does talk to us before he says that, changing topic, we simply just don't know yet and there's surely more information we need to discover before even coming close to it.
---
I like the theory that says Elder Dragons have been replaced before and that a young Kralk had to take his mother's role after killing her due to a possible overload of magic and following madness, but so far we can only theorize.
---
Given his children... I think the Torment was an outside influence that just grew within him. All the other crystal dragons' nature is to protect and bond with humanity. Even Vlast, in his own, weird way (he was prideful, but he wasn't maliciously so, I think). So that just brings up the possibility that 'who the hell's plan are we mucking up?'
---
If they don't change the skill, they should at least give us a range indicator,

It gives you the ability to:

If there was a plan for him to take his place like for Aurene, then it's likely they know in some way, but so far we just can't know and I'm itching to find out more about this whole thing ;v;
---
What I said so far is what my friends and I agreed on being possible with the information currently available, I just hope S5 will deal with what Kralk said in relation to what is happening with the other dragons.
---
I didn't though. These companies are coning their customers. Saying "part of me undertsands they need money" is like saying part of you understands that MLM proprietors "need money".
---
Intrestingly enough, Dragonfall is the only location that is composed of a single word.

It is only because the forgotten freed Glaust from Kralkatorrik control and she (and her children) got lectured about morality.

Lucky for you, Guild Wars is one of the easiest game to uninstall: just go to where it's located and delete the folder!

Customer support is notoriously amazing they can find your account and you can prove that you have access to it without that serial code usually the last for information like account names but since I can see you obviously freaked out over the littlest of hiccup you probably weren't going to be positive in the community begin with so have a good one.

You can also use edge of the mists, I did it with just me and another person.

---
hi, english teacher here!
---
there's actually two rules for why it's using 'the'
---
the first, like you described, is for a collective place.  like we say \*the\* UK and \*the\* Philippines, so \*the\* Sandswept Isles
---
the second reason is because we use the when there is only one of something (or only one in a place).  there is only one domain, so it's \*the\* domain of Kourna.  if they had decided to have taken out domain, it's just be 'travel to Kourna'
---
It sounds like you contacted them, but just in case: you don't *need* the code if you can provide other proof of ownership.  Just submit everything you can remember and they'll do their best to restore access.
---
Maybe use the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) then try uninstalling after it completes.
---
Haven't had much time to play since the episode is released...
---
By any chance is th skill called "Dracarys"?

oh

Yeah sorry I "freaked out" over not being able to regain access to the account I bought and paid for YEARS ago. Then being forced to go on a extended escapade just to remove a game.

The idea of replying in friend wouldn’t work like that. When was the last time you replied with “I would love to do [activity] with you [full character name]” instead of “me!” Or similar. It would be chat spam 90% of the time. 
---
As for a guild stone type deal... one of two things will happen. They will be stupidly short lived and virtually never seen because of map instancing, similar to banners now. Or they will be incredibly annoying and clutter, such as 200+ of them in LA or just outside the major cities.
---
Only given sufficient airspace for a stage 1 dive. If thats not possible, or you're actually climbing stuff, the Griffon falls behind.

Griffon is not strictly better.

its an archievement i think

With a name like that, I'm not surprised to see that you lack the IQ required to figure this out.
---
&gt; The basics of that system is already in the game for some Heart Missions

Really? Which ones? Also, what's the difference between pre and post?

Same thing happened with scrapper =D
---
what os?
---
if its an old window 7 32bit the 64bit client wont work, use the other download link
---
&gt; Putting it as 'Domain of ...' is more correct, though.
---
well, but.. you wouldn't say, "I'm taking a trip to Domain of Kourna," would you? (is a serious question, I kinda half assed my way through English and only cared about reading books)
---
I think saying, "I'm taking a trip to *the* Domain of Kourna," is both more natural and more grammatically correct.
---
It could've been if it at least were called Krasnaya (literally "Red") Square and followed the pattern of Jahai Bluffs, but it's a translated adjective of the original adjective (which respects the common declension rules). This makes no sense to me :/
---
Have you tried installing GW2 outside of C:\Program Files (x86)? Some Windows setups don't play nicely with it, something about Program Files (x86) having access restrictions. I believe you can copy/paste the entire GW2 folder into an outside folder or drive and it may work.
---
Yeah but at least I wouldn’t have to look at all the maps at once and I can look at them in a smaller context
---
So, I had no idea there where fast travel books. Presumably these eat the portal scrolls from each prior episode into a larger volume?

Is there a Library system yet for all the other books? Or am I going to have to keep using my least favourite character as a pack mule?

You should probably follow this guide https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guide_to_earning_Hall_of_Monuments_rewards#.22Cheap.22_guide_to_30_points to save time on farming currency.

I also advise that you just play through the campaigns first on normal difficulty, and ignoring the HoM till you're done to get a grasp on what else you need to do to get 30 points.

Teatime as a podcast made full circle. Started as a meme, ascended to being actually good and semi-informative entertainment around HoT and Season 3, after PoF devolved into the safespot for gw2 degenerates who know nothing but cheap drama.
---
I actually feel bad for Envy, he sounds like a dude who could be much more with different people.
---
Best bet is going to every map and announcing in map chat that you're doing it. If you post it in LFG, it probably won't be seen.
---
well, it's been known that Elder Dragons - while sharing a single goal in rebalancing the ambient magic of Tyria - don't necessarily get along with each other.
---
I don't believe he was entirely malevolent. nor do I think *any* Elder Dragon, following their biological purpose of eating *ambient* magic, are malevolent. if that were the case, each Elder Dragon would've made consistent and repeated attacks against all mortals - Zhaitan wouldn't have waited 100-ish years to take Claw Island. I think that was a power play to dissuade mortal races from challenging him, and we would've continued.
---
Kralkatorrik would have branded *all* of Elona after branding the Charr Homelands, and continued towards the Shiverpeaks and Kryta. Jormag would've pushed south at an extreme rate instead of staying put once he(/she?) kicked out the Norn. Primordus would've done what Deathwing did and split the world open in some form or fashion, probably somewhere in the Maguuma Jungle/Tarnished Coast/Domain of Winds areas. Sbubbles/Steve would've absolutely rekt Cantha (if it hasn't already) and then made a b-line for the closest mortal hub of activity that was water accessible. and Mordremoth would've done what he already *did*, which I think shows he was corrupted past his intended function.
---
Inappropriate reference to bodily functions would cover that.
---
&gt; Make inappropriate references to human anatomy or bodily functions
---
There you go.
---
It's a game. A lot of people use games to escape from reality for a little while.

A lot of people live in a reality where they, or someone in their immediate family are fighting for their lives against cancer.

When I quit playing Guild Wars I estimated (based on one 50/50 with GWAMM and one 30/50 with IHMLBB) that you can get 30/50 in a month. Not sure how well that estimation holds, but it's doable.
---
You need HoM to link GW1 to GW2 and activate the rewards stuff.
---
Mesmer relies a lot of talents compared to other classes, making them arguably the hardest class to level up.
---
If you're looking for something easy, Necromancer, Warrior, and Ranger are gonna be faceroll classes for solo play. These classes are gonna be tanky, with good sustain, and decent damage.
---
If you want something with a little more brainpower, Thief, Guardian, and Revenant will make you think a bit more, but once you got it down they can hold their own just fine.
---
It's a fucked up name and you're immature.

You having to ask here on reddit tells me that it does not matter what ever we will say about it, you will simply never get it. To me is more of a question why did it take this long to get it flagged.

oh okay thanks for the info!
---
There's a massive difference between what the guides say is meta and what people in game usually want. 
---
Druid is not Snowcrows/Metabattle meta, but you still see it all the time in fractals. Quickbrand and alacrity renegade might be mathematically the best, but you still see druid and chrono more often, from my experience.

Banner warriors are usually in high demand.

All skins should be lore-friendly and at least plausibly come from somewhere in the game world. A copy pasted model from another popular IP is not it.
---
The situation with social media has never been as black and white as you're trying to portray it. From her point of view I can easily see how she would separate the 2, from Anet's POV IIRC they didn't even have a social media policy at the time at least not one that was enforced.
---
Just a heads-up, for you, since you also need to take into account that you're a brand new player, it might take more than that. (Or even less if you're a bit crazy)
---
Yeah, you can buy the book and then the various pages. When you open the book with a page in the inventory, you get the option to "eat" said page. Allowing you to fast travel there.
---
Would love to have xpac ones too! They're so much useful that it's a shame to have them only for LS.
---
And no, you can't store them since there is no such system, plus it's an utility item....so I just put them in shared inventory slots, so all my characters can use them fast.
---
yeah language is tricky. Red isn't being used as an adjective here. it's not just a square that is red, the name of the place that just happens to be Red Square
---
You might find you have better luck on mesmer is you try some other weapons. For example sword and focus is nice as it allows you to group up a whole bunch of enemies with focus 4 and cleave them down with focus 5 phantasm and sword 2. 
---
While I do agree staff and scepter are fun they are based on condition damage (damage over time) which makes them a little slower at bursting enemies down. Since most low level enemies are squishy anyways, direct power damage is more effective.
---
Mesmer is an excellent solo class once you hit level 80 and pick up its specializations. A little rough to start with but it pays off later.
---
Try to get weapons with more upfront damage. 
---
Switch to sword/sword and sword/focus and look for gear with precision, power and ferocity. Greatsword is also pretty decent. 
---
Signet of Ether is a great heal because it allows you to fire off more phantasms, which really helps. Phantasmal defender and phantasmal disenchanter are both pretty hand to have as skills. 
---
Illusions is a good trait line to focus on. Dueling if you like swords, domination if greatsword is more your thing. 
---
Staff and sceptre both do damage over time, and just aren't that useful without the right gear so you'll always feel underpowered while leveling.
---
They are both pretty useful in PvP with condition damage and expertise and work well with the mirage elite spec at level 80.
---
&gt; I'm not acting like special snowflake about it
---
but about everything else
---
Domain isn't an adjective, it's a noun. we use the 'the' article with nouns if there is only one (or only one in a place), so it's the domain of... (and there is only one domain). 'the' is actually modifying domain and not kourna, etc
---
Played alone, hit 80, quit. Got married, played with wife, 29k achievement points later. It is definitely a good game for 2-5.
---
You might want to check the endurance speed on your skyscale then. This is about 3 times as fast as the normal one. You can do a barrel roll once every ~10 seconds with the normal endurance regen.
---
I found fishnet pants is the best content for light armor class since 2012...
---
[my norn necro](https://imgur.com/a/LCDkiIo)
---
armor is:
---
- WvW tier 1 boots
---
- Requiem Pants
---
- WvW tier 3 chest
---
- Requiem shoulders
---
- Foefire wraps
---
Hitting someone when he's fighting is not a benchmark for anything. Pretty much anything that does damage works.
---
[Go and have some fun somewhere else](https://i.imgur.com/H3n4tJF.png)
---
That's an Elon Dam
---
Mesmer is on the weaker side while leveling, but really shines at 80.  You've got a few options for soloing.  My favorite is Staff Mirage.
---
Reaper Necro and Daredevil Thief are also strong soloers.  Necro is probably the strongest soloing class in general.
---
Core mesmer is pretty damn tough as a solo class especially when starting off.
---
Once you hit level 80 you can go Chronomancer for power builds and Mirage for condition builds and both are huge buffs to both damage and survability for mesmer.
---
does it hurt being that dumb?
---
No no no, that's not what I meant. What I meant is that it read like the legislation *itself* was now "pay to win", not that it was legislation *about* something that was "pay to win".
---
Tybalt, introduction

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
Doesn't fit. GS is too big for a ninja. Give him  sceptre for something new.
---
Can't be unseen. Fuck you. Literally unplayable now.
---
Yeah! Ive spend 300 hrs solo. Loads to do.
---
it’s almost as if there’s a subreddit rule that there’s no spoilers (unless tagged) for 28 days after release so all spoiler posts in non-spoiler threads get removed
---
*shrug* giga is also pronounced jig-gah.
---
While the Elder Dragons do have the natural state of balancing magic from one extreme to another, nothing is ever stated to imply that this is an active goal on their part. Similarly, all of their actions and goals shown, stated, and implied all point to them being malevolent, and not at all related to balancing magic from extreme to extreme.
---
Just because the Elder Dragons are slow in their actions, doesn't mean that they're not malevolent at all. After all, can you consider a being who actively seeks to consume and destroy everything (Kralkatorrik) a non-evil being? Or what about a being who sends a minion to wipe out all surface life to prepare his own awakening in the depths of the earth (Primordus)?
---
The Elder Dragons function in periods of activity. Their first action is always to carve a swath of territory once they wake up, where they go "inactive" while they consume magic from ley lines and steadily building up an army. Their second period of activity has been to send those armies out to expand their territory (as we see from Zhaitan and Jormag); or to personally move to a new, larger, magical hotspot after consuming all they can from their previous bed (as we see from Primordus and Kralkatorrik).
---
Their interest is indeed more on consuming magic - which is a slow process - at least for the first few centuries (normally), but they also show very much violent and cruel actions towards mortals and overarching goals. And once they do have enough magic, as Kralkatorrik did, they go for their actual goal.
---
Didn't he throw his dagger once?  ;-)
---
May I ask how you came about this? I can't stand v.redd.it
---
Asurans has exaggerated animations. And spell casters has a lot of magic animation so maybe avoid those. I find thief animation really smooth looking, especially staff auto on humanoid. I would say humans probably have the most natural looking animation. If you can get over the mousy feel then i think you are good to go. Maybe change the height to max. You can look nice without being huge. I think the rubber feel comes from making a huge norn, since some norn animation are scaled up human animations.
---
I like axe warrior.
---
Yeah most companies operate on a Triage system for support
---
I would like to report myself but I also want to make that guy feel like shit. What do I do now?
---
Well, the OP complains about the game being CPU heavy, therefore it's reasonable to assume they have a good enough GPU, otherwise ANY graphics option would be causing them trouble and I doubt they would come to reddit to complain about the game's performance if they had objectively sub-par hardware.
---
I for one have GTX 1080, and the game still falls below 30 fps more often than it doesn't, and graphics-wise it has no right to perform this badly. For players with decent rigs the game is CPU-bound, and the CPUs that would play it well haven't been invented yet.
---
Cut your losses and move. No point in doing anything else.
---
&gt;  he just responded "well nobody asked you to gift me anything, so don't expect me to do anything for you".
---
Gifts should not come with strings attached.
---
Any strings attached to help you provide should be made clear when the help is provided.
---
Dealing damage is the same between ascended and legendary weapons.  Legendaries only give QoL features, flexibility &amp; unique skins and animations. They do not have better stats.
---
Not unless your name is Nanoha
---
Luckily, you don't have to choose between looks and damage when it comes to your weapons, you can have both!
---
Look at the stats you want, craft/buy an exotic. Maybe you can even craft ascended at this point if your Weaponsmith rank is maxed. It won't look amazing yet (probably).
---
Check out all the skins available for greatsword on the wiki (I'll edit with a link later, wiki is blocked at work :[ ). Pick a fave, unlock the skin by buying for karma, trading post, achievement, etc.
---
Transmute your perfect-stat weapon in the Hero Panel&gt;Wardrobe.
---
I heard that the company that translated first book held rights for another two, but it was closed and didn't sell the rights. To anyone else in Poland, thus no translations. I might be wrong tho.
---
I always thought that the air around the river had a certain musk to it.  :\^)
---
[Nope, it's against the Reddiquette](https://i.postimg.cc/t4JmvCw9/downvote.png) but continue to convince yourself of otherwise if it makes you feel better about it lol. I'm pretty sure a big 80% of the sub are derps like you and FENIU666 who use this function wrong.
---
How strong a weapon is, is completely dependent on the rarity (Up to Ascended) and the stats. Otherwise, the only difference between greatswords that have the same Stats and Rarity are the appearance. That being said, I personally like Eternity, Alchemist Greatsword, Daydreamer's, Forged, and Spectral, to name a few.
---
I do this for the spearmarshal's plea, for getting low level alts into Jahai, but otherwise I travel way to much to use the tomes that way. I also use them for hopping to the nearest ls3 or ls4 map before waypointing to save on silver.
---
Maybe something happened to him in real life and that is why he is not being active on anything other than GW2 and don't want to talk too much with people. 
---
Also not sure what you are expecting people here to say or do. Talk to him and try to figure out what is wrong or, if he no longer fit the guild, think about kicking him.
---
Better hope that no deers fall into it.
---
I'm the only one who voted for The Moot?
---
Meh... I'm still disappointed that ANet didnt put in Elon Musk Ox near the river.
---
I found it out the hard way. I bought all the ls3 scrolls and a new tome for second favorite chr, and then found out I didn't need the scrolls...
---
So you will need episode 4 about halfway completed
---
Check the wardrobe panel for all the available skins! You can preview how they will look on your character. Any in particular you enjoy?
---
&gt;random queuing
---
There is no queuing. You have to interact with real people to form a group.
---
No rainbow stick :(
---
With the way the game works you would have to spend a great deal of effort to actually be solo all the time ....
---
i still wonder who took the name Elonian Musk before my friend could do it
---
Is it the missing dot after Dragonfall that infuriates you?
---
I main daredevil and have played alot of fractals and I wanna try 100 cm. Will people accept me even if my class is only considered ”great” and not ”meta” according to Discretize?
---
The magics did drive him insane, but the story didn't do a good job at explaining it was more than just the post-Zhaitan magics. This isn't the first time the Elder Dragons awakened and we only know of one other time but suspect it has been going on longer than that. During all those cycles, most dragons likely absorbs some magics outside of their domains and slowly overtime that drove them to madness. When we killed dragons and gods and flooded large amounts of conflicting magics, that just made it much worse.
---
But if the slowly overtime thing doesn't make sense, there was an instance where all the dragons absorbed magic that is canonical: the fall of Abaddon. In PoF, Kormir mentions she was too late to absorb the power; while she did contain it, enough got out to stir the Elder Dragons. So that would imply that all, or most, of the dragons would have absorbed some of Abaddon's magic and since his domain was Water, that would be conflicting to all but Bubbles from what we know.
---
Yes
---
&gt; Reference real-life people
---
Wait what? I see so many character names that do that.
---
Dailies are not "must have" but rather nice bonus gains. Once you have map explored, they usually also are quite easy to do.
---
You can always do PvP ones, but for PvE ones, think about them as "many people might do those dailies as well, so if I come there, the maps will be packed by people above average".
---
People do tend to help with dailies, reporting events in map chat, mesmers on jumping puzzles, and so on... so it is up to you if you like that bigger activity or not.
---
And at the end....you can use it as a small hint what to do today...every day is different daily and it might be nice journey towards something new. But if you won't be able to make it, then don't fear, there will be enough time to do them another day. And for the experience - you gain it based on your level, not based on what you do.
---
I didn't know the beetle could drift and I doubt I'll ever have the 300 gold or whatever to get the griffon.  But thank you
---
  I'll look up the controls next time I'm on.
---
I'm a mostly solo player who's been trying MMOs since they started. GW2 is the most soloable MMO ever. If you are determined to never group with anyone, you can do almost everything in the game, including the complete story. If you want to group up for a dungeon or something, it's very easy to find an effective PUG. The open world content is designed so that lots of people can just show up and do the work, without having to formally group or anything.
---
&gt;you get the option to "eat" said page.
---
Reminded me of [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/ae/1a/3dae1aa202456a1371be0fd1affd6016.jpg) classic bit of art.
---
Spearmarshal's plea can be used to reach sun's refuge at level 2.
---
It wasn't pictured, but it could still be there. We haven't seen any Elder Dragons post-death to know what happens to their remains, but Zhaitan's body was planned to be in Arah explorable... There is also the tail, but that was sliced off pre-death.
---
Frenzy with the one vote is pretty funny. It’s an amazing legendary tbh but underwater combat is so underutilized in gw2 lol
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
Are we talking realistic feel as in non magic combat? That would only leave warrior, thief,  engineer and partially ranger. Otherwise I would maybe suggest revenant. There is a lot of fun to have with the class and swapping legends does feel rewarding when you pull off a combo and devastate a group of enemies.
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
The player's stats have no effect on the efficacy of mount engage abilities or mount health (with a few exceptions, like the 10% max health increase from the 6 set of some runes).
---
Additionally, even if they did, there's no power scaling component attached to the mount engage abilities.
---
Overall, I'm not that big of a fan of most Legendary designs. I got The Bifrost more for function than for looks; though I don't want to transmute it since it feels wrong to transmute a legendary.
---
But for designs, I think my favorite is The Binding of Ipos. I'd love to make it someday, but it isn't too useful; not many professions get Focus compared to the other types and it would only really match with my Necromancer who doesn't use Focus much...
---
My next favorite would probably be Exordium. When I go for a second Legendary Weapon, it will probably be this one. At first, it felt very Mesmery, but its design has grown on me and it is versatile enough that I can see it working on a few of my Greatsword characters and pretty much everyone gets a greatsword. My last pick for favorites would be The Shining Blade; there are a lot of fancy and shiny swords, but this one is pretty neat... That is about it.
---
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherf***in baller
---
I have flames of war and like it....
---
If you have decent dps and do mechanics correctly yes.
---
I'm a returning player looking to really dig into a support role, primarily for fractals, but I'd like to be viable in raiding too. Is druid still the be-all-end-all for that sort of thing? I'm currently torn between Druid and Renegade.

You might be the first person i have ever heard saying that lol
---
Mordremoth
---
Amazing meta, amazing minions, amazing lore behind the minions. It truly feels like he’s the mastermind behind all his minions. Branded, on the other hand, don’t really seem to show any purpose or intelligence, up until the beginning of the final story instance of the latest episode. 
---
Mordremoth has an amazing final boss fight in the meta event, an okayish meta, and a decent enough story instance fight
---
Kralkatorrik has a cool meta but an awful final boss fight in the meta, and a cool story instance fight. Although the first battle in Thunderhead Keep was amazing. 
---
The problem with Kralk is that he’s too big to get a cool boss fight where we fight more than just a small part of his body. But at least it’s not just an aggressive pedicure cough Claw of Jormag cough Tequatl.
---
Look at those *background ambient desert plants*
---
The only reason I click on these videos are for the music. 
---
I honestly don't gaf about benchmarks, but the tunes are always spicy.
---
Her job is taking all of her time these days.
---
Shell be back once it calms down.
---
Another great example that Anet *does* read reports. 
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
What's the point of watching a DPS golem benchmark if the music is bad? Isn't that the whole point?
---
no.
---
Depends. If you have the money to spare and you plan on playing a long time and gathering a lot, then yeah, absolutely worth it.
---
If you only play once in a while and you don't plan on playing the grind-grame with ressources, then probably not.
---
Raid flair checks out
---
It does seem like she is suddenly stronger, but I don't think that is the case. She likely was using that much power during the Kralk fight (e.g. the blast against Kralk before she died or the Resonance Blasts which were powered by Aurene). The final big blast likely is something she couldn't spam; she only used it (and it only worked) because we already weakened his wing with smaller blasters on weak points. And Kralk was only that weak to begin with because of the events of EP5; he was near death at the end of EP5 and he didn't recover that much in the time since, as seen from the bleeding.
---
So I don't think it is changing her power set on the fly; it is just seeming that way because of what you are focusing on and how you are remembering it. If you were to play both back to back without a 4 month gap, it probably wouldn't seem like that big of a change.
---
I want a top like this for my male ele!! Why do all the women get the slutmog options?? xD
---
So long as you know how to do a solid opener and aren't playing with super experienced, elitist groups it'll be fine.  You should be aiming for something like 15-18k+ DPS on every opening phase; 100-66 (Skorvald, Artsari) 100-80 (Arkk).  100CM isn't difficult if you make an effort to learn your rotation and deal non-garbage damage.
