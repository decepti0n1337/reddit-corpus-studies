at the beginning of the final story chapter, it is said that "Mordremoth is focused on the battle above, this is our only chance".
---

---
This was the pact assault in dragon's stand on the mouth of Mordremoth, The danger noodle we fight is merely a part of the dragon that feeds it. During that battle the commander battles Mordremoth in his mind. 
---
Now you (or me) might ask why the pact troops reffer to us as "commander" during the map meta event.
---
I don't know. Guess the commander has a twin.
---
---
---
I found an NPC selling Jute somewhere, then forgot who. He was either in the Astari, Charr, or snowy home town, now I can't find him at all... The towns tour overwhelmed me
---
There's a difference between "viable but not meta" and "I'll roll whatever I want for the sake of argument/being a troll". I think most people would probably understand what I meant.
---
they had 2 50% off sales that didn't include eotn which was the dealbreaker for me. I was looking to upgrade two to three accounts from gw2. i got 3 accounts with the trilogy + expansion.
---
anet couldn't match a hooker with a blow job.....
---
Ha. That's what I get for not playing Scourge yet.
---
&gt; Do the wide screens still look good with 1080p?
---
That really depends on you and what you're coming from. If you're used to looking at a standard 24" 1080p monitor then yeah of course, it's the same just with extra pixels on the sides (i.e. wider). The quality of the panel is also important, if you cheap out and get an off brand UW from China then you're going to have a much cheaper experience than if you pay for quality (Acer, Asus, LG, etc..). 
---
Talking to [Laranthir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Laranthir_of_the_Wild#Heart_of_Maguuma) or the other two commanders on the way to the final fight with the Mouth of Mordremoth reveals different dialogue depending on if you've completed Hearts and Minds or not. This suggests that there were actually three battles against Mordremoth: before, during and after the story instance.
---
Compare Laranthir lines dependent on player's progress in the story plus the third line from Canach during Hearts and Minds (presented here in chronological order):
---
&gt; **Laranthir:** Our scouts believe the creature before us is feeding on ley-line energy for its master, but Mordremoth is an entity of mind and dream. That's where you'll have to go to defeat it. (occurs in open world before completing final instance)  
---
&gt; **Canach:** The dragon is focused on the battle outside. We'll never get a better chance. (occurs during final instance)  
---
&gt; **Laranthir:** Though you killed Mordremoth within its realm of mind, the physical manifestation of its hunger remains in our world, still feeding on this hub of ley-line energy. (occurs in open world after completing final instance)  
---
This kind of complex plot was likely the result of the writers trying to work in the fact that players would be reaching Mordremoth before entering the final story instance, thus needing a narrative reason to justify the battles against Mordremoth before and after story.
---
With the characters' lines, I've interpted the events going as follows:
---
The Pact breaches into Dragon's Stand, sets up camp and begins the slow push towards Dragon's Domain with the Commander joining them. They recruit or otherwise use various jungle allies to boost their numbers and distract the Mordrem. They succeed in pushing into Dragon's Domain only to discover Mordremoth's physical avatar protecting the Heart of Thorns tree. Mordremoth prevails in battle, causing the map closing Shadow of the Dragon effect which kills off many of the invaders, forcing the Pact into a hasty retreat to regroup and lick their wounds while the Mordrem Guard Commanders are reborn and begin leading a Mordrem counterattack to crush the Pact forces. Laranthir comes to the conclusion that, due to Mordremoth having assaulted sylvari mentally, the link might be the Dream which connects the Grove sylvari, and thus the Commander's best bet to beat Mordremoth is to fight it in the Dream assuming they can figure out a way to enter it.
---
The Commander tracks down Dragon's Watch and decides to go behind enemy lines while the Pact and the jungle allies prepare for another push to play the role of Aragorn to distract the enemy from going after the Commander's Frodo. Events of "Bitter Harvest" and "Hearts and Minds" occur simultaneously with the Pact's second battle with Mordremoth: the Commander and selected allies enter the dream to defeat the mental avatar of Mordremoth, and the Mouth of Mordremoth head-spiking effect occurs with the explosive flash of light upon the Commander killing the last seed of the dragon's consciousness within Trahearne. The resulting ley line blast affects the Pact, forcing them to retreat to the destroyed Blighting Trees at the end of the three lanes. The three Mordrem Guard commanders die their final death, and the Blighting Trees won't rejuvenate due to Mordremoth no longer being around.
---
The Commander and allies emerge from the Heart of Thorns tree, which protected them from the ley line explosion, and rejoin the Pact. However, they discover that the Mouth of Mordremoth aka Mordremoth's physical and now braindead avatar rises one more time to threaten them, perhaps as a last dying gasp of the Elder Dragon or because of mutating ley line shenanigans (due to the big blast seen in the final HoT cinematic). The Commander and the Pact fight this remnant of Mordremoth and kill it off for good. In this scenario the full push through Dragon's Stand wouldn't necessarily be canon as only the final fight against the Mouth would matter to justify Laranthir's post-instance dialogue. But if it had to occur in full, a justification could be that the Mordrem Guard Commanders and Blighting Trees managed to revive one last time right before the demise of Mordremoth's mind, and thus both they and the Mouth need to be put down one last time. :)
---
Same. That sounds awesome!
---
Istan once a day(palawadan and great hall), sw, flaxfarm 
---
First of all, I had NO idea those faces/hairstyles were Elonian, much less that they are based on African culture. From that alone, it's **impossible** for me to have been racist.
---
Also, saying "I'm right, you're following a playbook, I won't reply to you anymore" doesn't make your arguments right, they make you sounds like a pussy.
---
During our fight with Mordremoth in his mind.
---
It's a really fun map to zip around in if you have all gliding and griffon masteries.  And the new mount mastery!
---
Nice work :)
---
"Games like this one", doesn't mention the name.
---
I enjoy killing Ignis and Aestus, what's to despise about them? They don't seem to have any unfair mechanics or bad tells.
---
I have a handful of Ascended Rings that I don't need and I am trying to get the Fractal Reliquary so I can grab some Gift of Ascensions. Should I go ahead and use a BL Salvage Kit on the Ascended Rings I don't use? Or should I infuse / attune them all before (although I do not think I have the means to do both)?
---
Good idea doing a side by side! I should take screenshots of the entire map then stitch them together, since Wargroove doesnt zoom out far enough.
---
Once they unlocked 7 hero party solo, i think mercenaries would be great if they were included but unnecessary. It would make clearing stuff quicker at the very least.
---
/wiki jute in game chat or just google it.
---
Do it. 
---
I did that heart in that way less than a week ago.  My stealth effect flashed a bit like it was going to go away but didn't.  Hug the wall and you can still make it around.
---
Then they probably weren't selling what you thought they were since materials aren't usually sold from NPCs.
---
Been working on map comp for my new main and I haven't seen a key in weeks.  
---
I live in Canada too, but ya I was mostly just referencing the old saying
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
How do I get BL Sprockets? Wiki does not say.
---
Gift of Ascension is 500 Fractal Relics from Vendor, or 4 BL Sprockets, or 25 Fractal Relics from Reliquary - making Reliquary the cheapest option.
---
Aweee!! I love this!!!
---
Maybe yur using Med Kit 3 to cleanse condis and Compunding Chemicals kicked in along with Medical Dispersion Field. 
---
That probably won't happen, unfortunately. It would cause extreme clipping.
---
&gt; Plus no one really buys wieners from a butchers shop or buns from a bakery.

That's what you think, peasant. \*Adjusts jewel-encrusted monocle* ^^^/s

Not running turrets trait. I have a roam tonight Ill have to test it isolated. From the numbers im getting it seemed like it was working with BpR. I can be taking zero damage, not have regen, and not be casting any skills and still be ticking hp/s on my allies. I guess Ill find out tonight.

It spawns for ANYONE who does not have one of the wall torches. And they do not despawn easily...
---
Have you tried setting up a group yourself?
---
Or when the daily events is there ^^
---
Ooooh, that's a yes. Thanks!
---
Aesthetic entirely lol. 
---
It bugs the crap out of me when something is not quite right like that. Similar to playing daredevil, when you have a staff out...and coat/trenchcoat gets stretched out to like 3x its physical size to accomodate the animation. I can't play daredevil with any coats. Then to make matters worse, the seam between leg and top on medium armor is so high because of said coats that the few tops without coats are pretty awkward looking. Sooo...outfit or sneakthief.
---
I play heavy armor classes almost exclusively nowadays.
---
Clipping bugs me, backpacks vanishing randomly because of transformations like shroud bugs me, ugly particle effects or effects that don't match the flavor of a class, legendary gear and infusions with clashing effects that you can't turn off...it is a long list. I am just a picky bastard. But I would rather be picky than be a collapsing vomit star with knees bent inward and a huge ugly backpack that seems to flicker in and out of existence.
---
Luckily, Guardian and Warrior are pretty well made for the most part.
---
No I was not and you as a mod is not supposed to say that in the first place, your suppose to not give personal bias only things against the rules. I will gladly screenshot this and send it to someone else in the company.  Also they where wrong to period they where trolling, flaming, and being condescending in the first place and will reveal this on other reddits if you threaten me again.
---
Right same for me, but people are to quick to judge.
---
In all honesty, the original implementation of spvp was probably the best version. Hotjoin rooms with the automated tournaments made for a much more interesting community were you could easily learn builds, test builds, and meet people. Then apply those in the automated tournaments.
---
*Look at r/Skyrim*. 
---
They're creating an Artificial demand
---
Not to mention that it was dev confirmed that both happen at the same time.
---
Here's the original preset https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8kf6ji/please_share_your_best_gw2hook_presets/dz87okz/

I enabled DepthHaze, AdaptiveFog, AmbientLighting (with intensity changed from around 10 to 5), DPX, Colourfulness and finally I kept the game's post processing on high (disabled auto-adjust)
---
&gt; the whole jungle is his body (when you fall down at certain places in the maps you fall into vines that instant kill you, these vines are also his body). So we only killed his mind and his mouth, not his whole body.
---
Not true. That's wrong. The dragon is the jungle is a metaphor for the corruption and his ability to transfer his mind. Even the devs confirmed it.
---
Oh, good one there calling me a snowflake, lol.
---
I said so. That is enough.
---
Well now, this just makes me want to buy Wargroove that I've not really heard much of. Just for making mods of maps.

Im looking for a song title, I think it plays during the The Shatterer but I can be mistaken. The song Im looking for sounds like a slower arranged version of the charr triumphant.

Its been a while, any help is appreciated.  
---
All these answers are great, but why does the Commander tell Trahearne that the Pact is "All but gone, Marshal. But my team and I will finish this." before you go into the Dream to attack Mordremoth's mind.
---
Why is the Pact "all but gone" if they're currently fighting and winning above us?
---
Draconis Mons stands as one of the most gorgeous maps they've ever made... But unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends for it.  
---
The map is gigantic but mostly dead... There aren't nearly enough events to make it feel lively, and the ones that do exist are incredibly basic.  A lot of that also has to do with the incredible amount of empty space in the map, which is part of what makes it gorgeous, but even with Oakheart essence, lava tubes and gliding (part of HoT so no mounts) it's incredibly tedious to get around the map.
---
The reward level for doing events and killing mobs on the map is not good.  Not enough to draw people back to the map, and far too many events involving champion mobs with annoying health pools and mechanics that ultimately exist to waste people's time.  
---
Putting so many group events on a map means it can't age well.  As the player population in it falls, the events will stop being done as often.  With that said, it really doesn't feel like planned obsolescence so much as somebody just failing to look ahead.  
---
The map's boost is for experience instead of karma.  Not many vocal people are horribly short on spirit shards.  
---
The hearts there are absolute crap.  They finally got improved long after the map was dead, but everybody who spent the 3-4 weeks farming that back item was doing it through tedious hearts that filled painfully slowly.  Basically those hearts took 4 and 5 times more "completion points" as similar objectives elsewhere in the game.  
---
And finally:  The Primordial Orchids are a farming joke.  Their drop rate is as painfully low as Blood Rubies, but the things you get for them aren't nearly as nice.  So it isn't even worth visiting the map to farm those orchid nodes.  
---
The best the map has to offer anyone who isn't just sightseeing is the flax farm that is frequently being patrolled by a blatant "fuck you" champion mob and a veteran bat that does more damage and has more health than most... Basically just Anet trolling the farmers.  So even the value of that is questionable.  
---
TLDR:  Gorgeous map, art department gets all the praise.  Everything else about it is completely wrong and stupid.
---
I miss the days before there was a limit on how many keys you could get that way... And that was back when you could start your story at level 2, so a run was even faster, especially with level 0 gear from your bank. Iirc you ended at a lower level too, like 10 or something.
---
Match making works... players attitude and give up lifestyle results in these kind of scores.
---
While the knees don't personally bother me by themselves, as someone else who hates casual clipping, the positioning of legs does make it hard to put together good looks with boots and skirts and jackets. My difficulties there have been with mostly Sylvari, though.
---
I, too, dislike excessive visual effects. I don't get the appeal of most of them, especially in combination.
---
I do not think you are understanding what I am saying... I am asking what is the best way to salvage ascended gear - as in does it matter if is attuned or not. 
---
&gt; you're a fucking moron
---
Yeah... That's attacking another user which is against our rules. I was well within my rights to give you a temp ban but didn't. Send it to who else? This subreddit is unofficial and ANet has nothing to do with us. You can complain to them but that won't do anything. If you spoke like that on their forums they would ban you no questions asked.
---
They were trying to explain things to you. You were being a douche about it. And as a moderator on this sub I absolutely have every right to give you a warning about your behavior. You're free to stick around and be nice but you want to act up and I'll have no problem sending you packing. Ban hammer hasn't been used in a week or so, could use some practice.
---
I second that. Buying a comm tag was one of the most worthwhile investments I've made in ages. Admittedly, I have a lot less time these days, but wait for the summer and I'll be back in full force, leading metas across Tyria (mostly HoT and PoF, if I'm to be fair)
---
Also, I'm a walking wiki so I end up helping people with info and/or escorting them places, spending a lot longer than I want to admit at times xD
---
South East Asian timezone, no problem finding people for HoT metas. Heck, did a T4 VB the other day because I needed the map currency and crowbars.
---
IMO 10 mins to Gerent is cutting it real close. When I arrive in TD with that time often I have to tag up and help out with a lane.
---
Fractals (my main game mode) is always populated.
---
The game has a queue for metas. It's called showing up early and being a commander/apple.
---
It's also a 7 years old, so what kind of world population are you hoping for in a casual game based around skins?
---
Boo hoo to your boo hoos
---
Awesome! Thanks so much
---
Play another game. The end-game loop in GW2 is pretty boring when you've experienced it enough. Fractals are the same, daily reset and T4s. World metas are meh. Grinding for gold is meh. AP farming is meh. PvP and WvW is non-existent and doesn't compare to games tailored for PvP experiences. Raids have way too high a barrier to entry for most players (scheduling, time, commitments).
---
Even better would be a wvw protest and leaving that shit empty for a week. Send the message that it really is broken.
---
But I've got a feeling that enough ppl enjoy it for what it is and that just won't happen. Gluck
---
Still waiting on the fix to bots flooding GvG and auto-disconnecting to prevent anyone else from playing, still not addressed after x many years. 
---
Preposterous
---
With the whole gaming industry being where it is right now I think a protest would cause drama between the developers and the community of the game. Thank you for the suggestion.
---
I think the alliance system is ArenaNet's hail mary.  If it flops then the mode isn't going to receive any more attention ever. 
---
Well, the cat is cool and all, but for me it would be all about the ranger pets, living shortbow, and last but not least the raccoon.
---
I have the henge, but I am gonna try this anyway. Lol. Already planned out some dialogues to yell
---
Yes it better improve and come out before game dies.
---
Anet *IS* aware that they need to fix WvW, honestly, I pray that the Alliance update will fix all WvW.
---
Just drop precursors tbh
---
according to my old guildies who i still talk to its been empty for years outside of certain servers and on reset nights for maybe few hours
---
This probably wouldn't work due to the weekly reward incentive; it would be hard to let the majority of the WvW playerbase know of such an event. It probably wouldn't result in a permanent drop of WvW players, only a temporary one. They might just run another double WXP event or something and call it a day.
---
You know, if you decide to make a thread and note there are spoilers in it, *maybe* try to avoid spoilers in the title?
---
Achievements
---
it will flop, at best it will get ppl interested to come back to the game for a few weeks. The core issues of WvW are power creep, skill imbalances and the damage the HoT expansion did to it. I'd mention how out of control condi has become too but I haven't played the game in a while and I know they did have some updates on condi, though just from reading the patch notes I don't think it's enough.
---
&gt; Moving away from world communities is one of the causes of WvW's demise.
---
so many people would deny this fact due to the sense of population increase it gave players by merging servers while actual WvW playerbase dwindled.
---
why those specific levels? sorry me just t2 fractals o\_o
---
Also known as a bulette.
---
 Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. 
---
The Pact was very nearly wiped out, but the remains of the Pact manage to defeat the Mouth of Mordremoth. Plus the allies you met along the way, and however many people the squads of players count as.
---
Look for miniature avian 3, comes out during anniversaries usually which is every year August ish
---
What is this Skyrim/Assassin's Creed visuals
---
I think there were probably rules for saying certain names. I know my local news channel sometimes even blurs logos to stay out of trouble. Still, we all could recognize it easily! 
---
Anet do have direct avenues to get feedback from players so they are aware of what players want. 
---
Wow, that was amazing!
---
What happened? 
---
Haha yes show mooarr
---
Why do people ask these questions like when will there be a sale, when will an item be back in the gem store. I don't mean to be rude but your never going to get a straight answer because the only people who knows this stuff is Arenanet. The community finds this stuff out when Anet decide to announce it.
---
Tarir multiloot was a proof that players can coordinate like a well trained and organized SWAT team when it comes to exploiting game, but still can't break a fucking break bar on a boss.
---
Alrighty then. Take care now, bye bye then.
---
That's really fair pricing, and such beautiful artwork!
---
Don't listen to all these people. don't you see the pattern? They have farmed enough gold for themselves and now they are glad that it's nerfed because no one else should be rich like them.
---
Istan is farmable, less profit but there's still a community there. 
---
Yah. I was pleasantly surprised. Me and my wife dated remotely for years while she was in school, and dated using guild wars. It was quite nice they portrayed all of that nicely 
---
Thank you!

It's more like Fire Emblem in gameplay 
---
7_7 we tried
---
Haha. Thanks!
---
'Tis a known glitch, without a proper reproduction pattern. Hilarious as frig when it happens.
---
This is why i stopped playing pvp
---
merging/linking servers was a cheap midterm solution to an issue 90% caused by desert borderlands and ANets thickheadedness regarding feedback on it. the alliance system is a far better solution, only that it's way overdue.
---
this is so cool and charming, queensdale in-game never particularly stood out to me besides being a blob of landscapes, but seeing it simplified like this and looking so iconic makes me appreciate the original map design a lot more too. great job!!

I just finished my first world completion two weeks ago, and by coincidence that was the final heart I needed to do. My fried brain spent about 20 minutes doing it over and over until it was complete, and I firmly believe it was made intended to be the final heart so that less people do world completion

Congrats on the Emmy nomination!  Looks to be well deserved recognition. Keep it moving!

The heroic upgrade is different from a paid account which releases the restrictions.  Just FYI.  So buying from the gemstore the heroic upgrade won’t get you what you are looking for.
---
It's not very polished, the extra effects that were not enabled in [this preset](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8kf6ji/please_share_your_best_gw2hook_presets/dz87okz/) don't even have configuration lines in the .ini so I can't tweak them. But if you wanna give it a try here it is https://pastebin.com/EQeuXrph (download and change .txt to .ini)
---
Note that I disabled AdaptiveFog here and replaced Colourfulness with different vibrance fx... haven't really been able to find a setup that would look good everywhere, some places are too colorful while some others look drab and lifeless.
---
You can’t buy heroic keys outright.  You have to have them given to you, generally.
---
If you’re looking to pay then there are semi-frequent discounts for the expansions.  PoF has gone on 50% sales multiple times already, and with a new marketing campaign kicking off there might be some more sales upcoming.
---
"Blame" those, who skip mechanics \\o\\
---
The dilemma for WvW is when there’s a lot of cooperating ppl, it’s awesome and too many ppl want to join and have to sit in queue, but when numbers drop they drop hard. (Same problem Warhammer Online had.)
---
I wonder if EotM could be changed into a core map, beside EBG, to give more space to players and break up the tedious karma train that is EotM currently.
---
It'll be back, you just need to keep an eye out for it. If you can, collect Black Lion Miniature Claim Tickets and watch the rotation. The birds have rotated in and out of the stock available there a couple of times now, iirc. Will probably cost 2 tickets.
---
Yep, if you don't pick up the torch, you should kill the thing. But I shouldn't be punished for people not picking up the torch. To me that's bad design.  Obviously not everyone is going to spend time killing their own elite.
---
Depends on the time of day.
---
Even then the population is so small that if they do it at the same time it will often work.
---
Its guaranteed if they group together.
---
It really isn’t, because it isn’t sold anymore, just new old stock. They were giving it away for the Kung Fu Tea promo (regionally restricted). You’re better off buying either expat during the numerous sales on them.
---
If you compare the number of people playing it now vs last year, then the year before that etc... you can see it is dropping faster then any other game mode by far.
---
The lack of updates, meaninglessness of the mode and toxicity of many of the people involved (especially given how long cheats go unaddressed) makes a good many leave and others not want to do it to start with.
---
Throw in the fact that rewards are less then 1/4 what PvE rewards and the problem gets magnified.
---
OK, looks like the Heroic Code isn't as widely available as I assumed it was. Fair enough. My friend will just have to play the base F2P version, and decide if he likes it enough to upgrade based on that. 
---
Anyways, thanks for all the help guys!
---
Something reddit rules something something brigading frowned upon if not outright bannable. something something.
---
Forgot about that! That was an interesting one, tight quarters and all!
---
Can we save PvE and PvP too while we're at it?
---
If I am not mistaken, it is $15. I dont think you can gift it but you could give your friend a gem card! Unfortunately you cannot send gems through the game client either.
---
Get your griffon  and then re-explore Tyria from the skies.
---
She left Anet.
---
Yes, it's correct. Recent outfits have been on a contract work.
---
&gt; As a community I am sure we can initiate a series of changes to make WvW a better game mode with a healthy playerbase and a healthy update/balance cylce
---
If ANet had all of the following:
---
* The management will/desire to update, fix and expand WvW into a main game mode.
---
* Resources and knowledge to do the above.
---
* A concrete plan of action they can follow to start changing things.
---
Do you not think something would have happened already? It's been **six years**. And it's still a far inferior knock-off of RvR from DAoC. Yeah sure it's the closest we got but it's still a long long shot off. There's no relics (granted the orbs were the same idea but instead of doing something about hackers they instead removed them), no farming spots in WvW superior to PvE, no proper material gain/loss, no slow movement of army control over the map and crucially, no auto-balancing of population via **Darkness Falls**.
---
There's a reason RvR worked so well, and that is because it encouraged everyone to **care** about their realm's RvR situation.
---
If ANet, 6y after release, hasn't even **begun** to do these reworks, then either they can't or won't do them. Budget 
---
I purchased the heart of thorns expansion online for my lil bro a week ago for $14.
---
the meta wasn't 'stability' as you call it because all you needed was 1 stack and everyone had that lmao. Not that I don't agree with you tho
---
Aside from PvE in it's current state. If you think about when was the last time WvW received some meaningful update ... it's been a LONG time. If anything I'm impressed there are any people left in WvW - Anet's least loved child.
---
Not sure if this is a joke or not. Either way it's in pretty bad taste my dude.
---
Sent you a message on Discord :)
---
No worries! Tell me more when you can!
---
Even Edge of the Mists had MULTIPLE overflows with couple commanders running every day. Good o' times.
---
One part of me is praying that they do care (Alliances), that they're waiting for crowfall/CU, similar RvR games etc to release so they can compete or gather ideas if it proves successful and implement their own version. I love WvW... hate to see it in such a stale state.

it would be nice if they did it like the swaggering hat. Where it changes the hairstyle to one that fits the hat, but doesn't make you bald.

I see you posted it here ! It's a nice map ! :D
---
that's not tripping out, that's just what Eir does when no one's looking.
---
not going to be much fun with the current state, imagine the condi necro bombs from a BG blob (a server that is full AND linked) against a less populated server. We'd already know who the winners are.
---
sorry, I wasn't sure if it was ok to link it or no. Updated my post with the details.
---
I like WvW even though I only do my dailies there. It always makes me feel like I'm in Lord of the Rings when I'm playing on the Alpine Borderland. I think WvW deserves a lot more attention.
---
Well the next legendary SHOULD be the 2nd gen Greatsword.  Once that is out its fair game for all weapons.  (Unless underwater weapons count lol).
---
It lets you leap off mounts whenever you want, so yeah. It's great!
---
Well last one mission for gen2 is great sword, which is highly anticipated for the next episode.
---
IF they implement a gen3 there is a high chance for a melee themed staff, but no one knows if our when it will be. 
---
This give a reason to play it. Make some new maps open up eotm, give full weekly pips faster. In there grinding for weekly tickets for legendary armor and its just super painful. And having to rely on outnumbered bonus means playing alone and being grouchy being there forever wasting whole evenings taking goddamned camps.
---
And what my 2nd post on reddit today and try again in 5minutes. Like why the hell should I use reddit then. 
---
the alliance system wouldn't be at the root of the disaster though. it will simply become collateral damage to the symptoms of neglect wvw is suffering from already (this includes a potential hackjob of an implementation). as i said, it alone won't be able to restabilize, or in other words rescue wvw from its demise.
---
there is this pretty big stigma out there about the wvw community not knowing what they want. in truth all aspects of this (and other) game suffer from this. pvp, fractals, raids, even open world and story. an alliance like system in contrast is what has been coninuously asked for almost since launch.
---
could it prove to be ineffective for the state wvw is in when it finally ships? could it be implemented in a hardly working state? yes, however that wouldn't be the systems fault, but a result of the overall neglect for the gamemode up to and oncluding that point.
---
I love Tangled Depths. Might even be my favorite map. No other map offers as much to discover. So many hidden paths and shortcuts.
---
So cool! I now want to do the same with some other map: Kessex Hills or Brisban Wildlands. 
---
I prefer merch that doesn't look totally like merch. Without a big ass branding. Fans of the game will know it's GW2 but everyone else will see a beautiful Shirt. 
---
I'm not quite sure how you make your shirts but I would love some of the concept arts printed on a whole shirt. Not only a square containing the image but a image that wraps around completely. Sylvari concept art with a lot of flowers and leaves  could look amazing. 
---
Probably you can't actually print it but that's my dream merch. 
---
Items with the icons of the elite specs from Path of Fire would be really nice since these seem harder to find on either the official site or red bubble without the design and clothing being too masculine. 
---
as long as they do not announce a thord set, close to 0. keep in mind the greatsword we'll get ieth the mext episode is still technically HoT content.
---
There are only now a few select builds where condi is used these days. condi mirage (which is an issue not just based in wvw) and scourge ( power / grieving is the more optimal choice in zergs). The rest of the condi builds are mostly niche builds. 
---
Everything these days is literal *power* creep. Hammer herald or sw/sw herald, sic em soulbeasts, deadeyes, holos, spellbreaker, power mirage, core guardian. These are just a few of the crazy strong power builds that plague wvw these days
---
Oh not to mention how ridiculous firebrand is for support. 
---
Wvw has changed so so much since you quit my friend.
---
Laurals. Log in daily. 
---
Damn it! Missed my opportunity. I'd totally commission you in a damn heartbeat!
---
I fear underwater weapons lel, hope they don't count 
---
OK noted this down :) Thanks for taking the time to reply !
---
For me, the worst part of them was waiting for the meta to find out everyone's only doing Ignis. So I would wait to the next one to see if Aestus gets done ... Nope Ignis again.
---
They're a horrible byproduct of the open world mentality of "1 a boss down with tag". Since it's best to kill both at the same time
---
Yes we tried that with our DC Officewear (skirts) and it's something that people have suggested where they can wear something that is subtle and a nod to said branding. Tops can definitely be done like this.
---
A bit of the problem when talking about WvW, it's very broad. To illustrate that;
---
&gt;I'd mention how out of control condi has become too
---
In a lot of guilded comps I've seen very little condi, mostly power, due to power creep on revenant and it's ability to shut down a more necro based comp. Necro comps are still largely power, with a splash of condi at most. Either way, power in these instances is in a healthy spot, and condi is thankfully no longer dominant. However I would wager this flips when you are less than 10p, with havok/pretendpvp. I have no idea what the balance is there, I avoid it like the plague. But every time some rando tries to jump me, it's almost always condi.
---
Looking at power itself it's kind of a basic but flawed issue. Nerfing revenant would probably bring melee into a really heavy focus for group comps, whereas nerfing scourge would likely bring pirate ship into full swing as nothing would compete with revenant damage. Could try to nerf both, but likely just end up in an early-HoT meta if so where people would be unkillable. To some extent there's no real "win" because of how a lot of the elite specializations are designed, some play style will always lose out. It's more a matter of who. Anet has too many gears in their balance engine to make definitive moves which are wholly healthy to all. Which is not to say this is bad, or unnatural, but it's a kind of decision Anet is absolutely horrendous at and I think we see that really clearly in WvW.
---
We can dig deeper than that though, and look at a more underlying problem with WvW: The balance gets called out a lot, and it's kinda bad sure, but it's always been bad, that's nothing new. Problem is that it's also increasingly stale too, which is arguably more damning. We haven't gained diversity, or a shift in how combat can be approached, since PoF. And before that, HoT really only had like two metas for its entire run. PoF's meta is changing now (in a kind of non-change change), but in a way which is highly unfortunate. Mesmer was effectively removed from the game for 15+ groups in the recent cycle. Warriors and Engineers were brought down a peg (at least) as well, making them more niche or specific picks. To a lot of comps, that means Firebrand, Necro, Revenant, basically rules the ecosystem. Tempest exists and gets played to some comps, Thief for comps that blast stealth, but that's 3+2 classes out of \*\*9\*\* that mean anything right now. If condi was a huge thing we could see Engi be considered but that's a \*maybe\* compared to Tempest atm. And it's the same three base classes which have ruled the meta(s) they've been involved in. GWEN was the original meta, and revenant broke in on it's release. Guard has never been de-seated as the support of the gods, and when we keep seeing expacks roll out support specs, that kinda blows. Not only because it's unfortunate to never have the choice, but because it's stale as fuck to see Stand Your Ground define so much for the mode now going on \*seven years\*. There is a reason why games like LoL do their damnest to break the game at least yearly. It's not because the balance gets better, it's because they want to make sure their game doesn't stale.
---
Amazing. I'm gonna look out for it. 
---
#***rubs hands wishing for new legendary Greatsword that doesn't look like a flipping ironing board***
---
The current devs are more aware and more responsive than any we've had for WvW before. The only issue is that they don't dedicate a ton of resources to the team. I believe there are only 2 people working on WvW full time, so new content takes awhile. I'm hopeful for alliances, but also worried that there won't be much of a community left by the time they come out.
---
Either way, we shouldn't be asking the WvW devs for more, but for anet management to dedicate more resources to the team. 
---
What about the Kodan who is rapidly pacing.
---
I have no idea what the Istan part would want. 250 ore is trivial, but 250 ingots is insane. 
---
\+1 you hunk of a man.
---
It'd be really awesome to see meaningful resources dedicated to WvW, maybe GW3 will have that chance and we can see what a sizeable team would do with a clean slate to work with.
---
Yeah, I posted this as a meme format but I actually did pretty good, interesting raid as well :D
---
Or long hair. Norns have amazing hair, why can't humans? 
---
Fire elemental was awesome. Thanks.
---
If you are referring to image it is meme about Pepe, if you are referring to names those are people I play with haha
---
Hell yeah!
---
:&lt;
---
It looks like you got early access to the next expac: Dance Wars 2
---
I swear this was just meant to be a bulletproof monk reference, right? I'm surprised nobody has mentioned it yet. 
---
Yeah, you wouldn't know it but she can be a real Eir head sometimes.
---
eotm was a quick solution for the long ques back then. wouldn't make much effort for that i guess. it wasn't really the problem the map itself but how the rewards worked. it was more profitable to just ignore each other and just karma farm. even on main wvw we had servers that were avoiding fights and were searching for quick caps. not to talk about defenses that people would prefer to just ignore a tower and cap it back later instead of defend it.
---
hold on, wait for test on variable refresh rate monitors, maybe it turns out to adding some extra config on this behaivour
---
The prices are negotiable so you get in touch to discuss depending on what you are requesting.

Oh you sweet summer child. Let this one go.

Monster Hunter: Guild Wars Edition
---
I understand that, what I don't understand is why *offering* and not *accepting as payment*? 
---
Fractal boxes can also contain ascended materials, and raid bosses give you a special loot box as achievement reward, which has a pretty good chance (from my experience) to also give ascended mats, but of course is a one-time thing because of the achievement system.
---
We wanna know what conditioner he uses to keep his fur so soft D:
---
GW2 is b2p...
---
I'll accept an actual ironing board. 
---
I don't see any of these as actual problems. Over the years I've come to think "powercreep" is the favourite excuse of the incompetent. Condi \*was\* out of control, but that got toned down.
---
The one actual problem WvW has is the bandwagoning and the huge imbalance in player base, coverage, and average skill, that stem from it.
---
True DBL for me clearly was made with pve in mind and especially with gliding. Another mistake I remember is that in first tests of DBL the ones who got invited were streamers/YouTubers who never played wvw before. 
---
If you're adding for help, at least tell us whether you're on NA or EU!
---
I think they should take damage down by 5-10% in wvw, ofc i dont know if that would really help as much as i think it would, but i just feel like wvw have grown far more with damage then defence so health pools far too fast
---
And now i feel like i see more deadeye and the like able to 1 or 2 shot people, before you get to react to it
---
inviting content creators is a decent way to promote the new map. unfortunately that motivated way too many backseat gamers to join the discussion. i still wonder if anet ever had any intention of listenig to feedback in the first place, or if those had much of an influence on anet's stance.
---
WvW had tons of potential, but even with the tournaments, it was bound to failure. The core aspect of WvW, is to team up (guild or pugs), kill the invaders, take out "castles", camps etc and repeat. The repetition is what kills me of having fun in WvW with a guild.   
---
In my opinion,  Lineage 2 had this right. Siege castles during a day and you had to sign in you clan in order to participate in the siege. After the siege, the new clan had the opportunity to control the economy of the place and no new sieges for 2 weeks (have to double check the period, not sure).   
---
If GW2 was like this, i think it would be a blast, leaving the rest of the off siege time to practice, but i guess it would need to have other events in order to ensure WvW was alive in off siege time. Any ideas?   
---
This is just my experience talking in WvW, always been a PvP (now retired) player (doing more PvE content lately), but YMMV.  
---
I don't know what all this is because I'm not a tech person at all, I'll have a friend look at it and tell me BUT
---
If this does prove to be helpful for others than thank youuu because I will definitely be trying it! Been having fps issues for awhile now the last year. Its a shame, they should spend a few patches to actually optimizing the game imo...
---
This is a great tribute to Aurene
---
i agree. as for DBL, i think a "stresstest/beta and feedback" event for accounts with some decent wvw activity should have come before an event to primarily advertise it. i doubt they'll ever see themselves in a comparable situation, but i hope they learned from it nonetheless.
---
istan was never all that great
---
Hey folks, new player here.
---
My ping is usually around 100-150. I was wondering if this will severely hinder me as a Thief later on (especially in PvP which I would really like to eventually focus on), since it's one of the more reflex-intensive (and IMO fun) professions. I don't find I have too much trouble atm (lvl 26, leveling) but some input from more experienced players would be greatly appreciated, as my OCD just won't shut up about this.
---
Thanks!!
---
Stage 1 - Denial
---
from the first look, none of those are supposed to give any advantage, that is not there by default
---
&gt; Just wait patiently
---
I'm sure this works out for every online game ever.
---
Saved for later. Thanks.
---
Thanks :) 
---
I don't remember correctly but i think it was The Voice that had We Bleed Fire + Frailty once. You had to ALWAYS dodge the ball, because it was a one shot.
---
Weaver is one of the best (if not the best) DPS for Fractals in either very organized pugs, or very organized guild parties.
---
For pugs, it's really a hit or miss. Which i definitely hate 
---
These settings wont do shit.
---
Forcing your cpu into high gear all the time will just generate more heat and use more power when you arent playing anything, when the game is running the cpu is already clocking 100% anyway. Youre going to have to overclock to get more performance out of this game. 
---
GPU see above. This game is a CPU hog instead of a GPU hog anyway. 
---
Priority will help if you have other programs on your system taking up cpu time, which you shouldnt be running while playing anything anyway. 
---
Their main focus isn't 80% LW.
---
It's more like: 40% focused on gemstore updates, 40% on LW, and the other 20%, as you mentioned split across the PvE/PvP modes.
---
Usually around festivals, maps like draconis are pretty empty. I would check back at peak hours this weekend and you will probably get it
---
Mate, the powercreep is undeniable, no matter if you see it or not.
---
Vulnerability windows dropped considerably to a point where rotational finesse matters pretty fucking little. Boons are absolutely everywhere (not to mention uptime...) and skill sets have become increasingly bloated over the years.
---
Just compare the status quo just before HoT launched with stuff like Firebrand, and try to tell me again that powercreep is a sad excuse for the weak.
---
Obstructed. 
---
There is so many obstructed paths that are invisible in that camp haha 
---
One small detail I use a lot for my setup is to have my character out of center screen. I adjust the camera to have my character off on the left a bit. Its a small change, but to me had a big change in how it felt. 
---
It's always a pleasure to see people helping others...
---
But, for my experience, none of these tweaks may help increasing fps in GW2 .
---
Gpu max performance is only a waste of watts since GW2 is only CPU bound.
---
Setting higher priority is never a good idea (old but wise reply [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/19o7jn/gw2\_dc\_and\_setting\_task\_manager\_priority/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/19o7jn/gw2_dc_and_setting_task_manager_priority/))
---
Maybe from "High performance setting in Power &amp; Sleep" (but with increasing watt usage and temperature) you can get a (very very) little boost.
---
Use Game mode in win 10 instead.  (it's getting better in the latest releases)
---
I'm not saying there's no powercreep, I'm saying it's irrelevant. All this does is change how the game plays. For instance, there are a lot more boons, but there are also Winds of Disenchatment. 
---
I'm also not saying it's an excuse for the weak, I'm saying it's a misguided critique. It's not the problem, it almost never is. Remove the powercreep, the bandwagons still remain and they still completely dominate their MUs week after week. Nothing changes.
---
OK thats great thanks ! :)
---
Ignorance was the problem in the past. Anet doing dumb shit to burn their hand and go "oh shit, this hurts. Lets just not do anything to prevent us from fucking ourselves over again". 
---
But at this point the issue isnt' ignorance. It's plain "we don't want to bother". Anet will NEVER fix WvW. Maybe if the game gets another publisher, as a community project or somehow private servers pop up. Anet has 0 interest.
---
copper fed is imo a must have item!
---
It annihilated the roaming scene, that's what it did.
---
Why bother trying to roam with 3 or less if you can't kill groups anymore, let alone trying to take objectives before said unkillables arrive?
---
100% the copper fed, it'll mean you don't feel like you need more bag slots. Also if you have a shared inventory slot you can use it on any character, whereas the bag slot is for one char only.
---
What I find to be very space efficient and handy across all characters is to put a salvage-o-magic in a shared inventory slot. I think a large majority of the community does this. It allows you to use your salvage device on any character without taking up “bag” space. I shared inventory spaces aren’t cheap but for certain use cases they are extremely handy.
---
Those msconfig settings shouldn't do anything- by default it enables all cores / threads.
---
Instead of using high performance power profile all the time, please consider disabling core parking instead. [Registry change to show Core Parking in power settings.](https://www.overclock.net/forum/297-general-processor-discussions/1544554-core-parking-windows-disable-more-performance.html)
---
If you look at GPU-Z while playing, you'll often find your graphics card is basically underutilized. It's waiting for the CPU before it can draw more frames. Forcing it into high performance mode all the time will not make much difference besides heat. [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/)
---
Playing with Process Priority is a double edged sword. Instead I'd recommend getting Process Explorer and seeing in detail what else is running, then trimming down on unneeded bloat by disabling those unneeded programs and services. [Process Explorer (Overcharged Task Manager)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
---
A little like how a chicken with it's head cut off can still move around for a period of time thereafter. In this case the mouth did the last thing that was imprinted on it, defend the tree.
---
Tl;dr damage is too fricking high coupled with OP firebrands making the meta essentially a midrange power blob that spikes and kites, nothing particularly engaging going on. 
---
But: Fights and servers are imbalanced and the meta just makes it worse. There is a real lack of talent to the point where lower skill servers get completely farmed and everyone but the top guilds get shit on. Every GvG tournament ends with mass disbanding as they soon realize there's about 40 good players at any time, the rest posing little resistance. 
---
Idk, it's just too hard to take seriously when it's 7 years on and been a shitshow for the majority of that time. 
---
Omatic into the shared slot

Take a look 👀

It's his secret. Many Blood Legion charr have tried to find out.

It's not even close. Get the CFSoM.

I genuinely love the amount of low key furry in this sub
---
I didn't bother responding to his comment, but thanks for letting him know of possibilities x)
---
Clearly some people don't understand what some of these settings modify and what they are for.
---
&gt;Do we need visuals here? I can make some graphs and parse some arc logs if you still don't get it.
---
*Do this*, so you will prove yourself wrong. 
---
&gt;A power class delaying a 30k hit is the same as a condi class delaying Bleed stacks that will do 30k damage,
---
It's not at all the same. Burst damage IS NOT a DoT and vice versa. Additionally damage is not quite as loaded into specific skills for condi builds as it is for power builds - *This has already been told to you.*
---
&gt;ne is just noticed instantly and the other takes time to show the dip.
---
Of course condi takes longer time to show the dip - that's why it's better. Because it doesn't drop as severely and it won't have by the time you're back, unless in your head condi DPS also means the mechanics they do take much longer. 
---
&gt;for every Mirage Scepter there is a Holo Rifle.
---
Poor example considering that the only skills used on Holo in a rotation are 3/4/5 and that while it can be run on some bosses, most Mirages don't run Scepter.
---
Rytlock finally accepted Joko and ascended.
---
Having your mouse and keyboard freeze because of CPU priority might happend on an 10 year old rig running Windows XP, don't see these things happening with computers running with updated Windows and drivers.
---
Also I appreciate your opinion, thank you for your response sir!
---
If you have outnumbered during a tick it won't go away before the tick is over, as long as you were there for the start of the tick.

I sent you a message about this, in Brisban Wildlands there's a misplaced heart at the Watchful Source Waypoint [https://i.imgur.com/d0WImbX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/d0WImbX.jpg), but it's also here where the actual renown heart is so it's no biggie: [https://i.imgur.com/tWCI1Ub.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tWCI1Ub.jpg) 
---
Such an amazing work nonetheless and i'm rocking these markers for my map completion, 6 areas completed with ease, love it!
---
The exact same Collection was available for almost 10 years already in a physical box. They just added that now to their own store digitally and this Collection and even if you bought the games separate or in boundles, they were quite often on sale.
---
Them trying to make it sound like it's something new and then demanding the same price from 10 years ago is pretty fucked up in my eyes.
---
Copper fed kits will let you salvage along the way on long event trains/metas. When you get easily get 50+ things to salvage on some of the metas now, buying one is a no brainier. Use it to salvage anything Green, Blue or lesser quality. I've found that buying 1 additional bag slot and using 20 slot bags is enough space to avoid having to babysit your inventory so often. Remember the inventory slot expansions are per-character. Keep things in the bank you don't use often.
---
Kinda weird that people saying "thanks I'll try these" are getting downvoted.
---
Is your discord name the same as your reddit one? Post has been removed.
---
Well pvp is almost the same, if you don't play a bunker build.
---
well i dont have expansions so its the same for me?
---
Some people on Reddit are just... I'm not gonna get into it tho :)
---
I saw myself and I am very confused by the fact that some of these people are downvoting users that will give it a go.
---
That's not what "harsher monetization" means. What he is speaking about is, that if you wanted the stuff from the GW1 store, you had to buy it with real money and you couldn't earn ingame currency to dodge using real money. GW2 has ingame currency that can be got with ingame gold. So the GW2 monetization is less harsh.
---
To your other point, there was a fuckton of gold selling going on in GW1.
---
&gt;Since a single character can only hold a maximum of 100Platinum at any one time, armbraces are used as an alternate currency to facilitate high-value trades, e.g. for hard-to-obtain weapons or miniatures. Other common alternatives include Globs of Ectoplasm and Zaishen Keys

---
Well that's also not correct, it uses up to 40% of my i7 7700k and game still runs like an ass, after these settings modified atleast I don't have spikes, I run majority of the games on Ultra, World of Warcraft on preset 8 without any lag at all, so yeah... This game runs differently for everyone which is a known fact, my friend has better frames on a potato PC so some of these things won't do any harm, they can only help boost performance or overall smoothness. :)
---
Thank you for your response!
---
Nice to hear you like it, I'd like to tweak it more if I knew how to edit the effects that don't have config lines in the .ini :D
---
It's worth it until it drops to 30 FPS in the open world :&gt;
---
Download HWInfo or some other CPU monitoring software. Run GW2 with HWinfo on in the background (and nothing else) and you'll see that it will pretty consistently use 100% of your CPUs max clock speed.
---
Changing your windows power settings is not an overclock.
---
Depends. I have a glyph of leather on my axe, so chopping wood allows me to craft both Spiritwood Planks and Elonian Leather Squares. Buying them from the TP might be faster, especially if you are running dungeons and/or fractals.
---
200% from silverwastes alone, over 300% from account and you're at 500%+ without anything. Another 25% from guild, 20% amulet, 40% food, 30% utility, 25% new year (gift + memories) gives 140% additional. Boosters count for another 300% as well. Really not that hard to get if you plan for it and do silverwastes. 
---
Because these will not work.  We know from years of experience that they wont.
---
Because pve and the gem store are what makes the money. So why would they devote time and resources to competitive game modes?
---
You realize that components are damaged by simply running right?  Everything suffers wear and tear.  And the harder you run them, the faster that wear and tear occurs.
---
Heat, power consumption, how much load you put on components all plays a factor.  Are you going to break then soon?  No.  But I didn't say that.  You ARE damaging them unnecessarily though.
---
Think of the components like any other mechanical or electrical device.  If you use your car as expected but do pointless things like idle it outside in your driveway all day every day when you aren't driving, you are putting undo wear on your engine that doesn't need to be there.  Your car will break down and need repairs sooner than if you did not do that.
---
You are telling people to run their GPU at load with no actual benefit to doing so.  It is a waste of energy and you will be running the GPU at max load with no benefit which will effectively lower the life of the card.
---
Believe what you will but it's common sense for anyone who makes a living with computers and electronics.  Or even anyone who has building their own computers for any reasonable length of time.
---
Adjusting random settings without acknowledging the cost or risks of doing so is a fools errand.
---
WvW isn’t the games populations main focus though. Think about how many players each map holds (60-70 now I believe, down from ~100 at launch). Now think about the average concurrent log in for Gw2. Likely to be at least 50-75k. A few years ago they were averaging ~200k concurrent log ins. Not so sure now. 
---
I agree anets resource allocation is god awful. That WvW and PvP have very obviously been thrown to the side the last two years. ESPECIALLY since Colin and Josh left the company.
---
The mode has bled a majority of its players by now though when you break it down and it’s really sad. 
---
You are acting like I don't actively play GW1 now (spoiler: I do). 
---
Just because someone is too stupid and/or unwilling to play GW to its fullest potential doesn't somehow mean that content doesn't actually exist. That's like someone buying a 2 hour movie, then fast-forwarding half of it saying "WTF it wasn't 2 hours! what a rip off"
---
FFS are you guys poor or something? In what universe is $40 for a massive game considered too much?
---
especially with that free (if it still is) shard bag slot. 100% put it there and this game becomes 100% better
---
Most RPG games
---
Copper fed. You can put it in one of the shared inventories slots and use it accross all of your characters, while the extra bag is character bound. Besides, with the copper fed, the invetory cleaness saves you the extra space you would get from the extra bag. 
---
Is 300% luck from account is baseline now? :D I salvage a lot but I'm at 120% atm.
---
I just play the TP all day so I can't fill in this survey
---
Good point. I don't really matter. Another reason to keep waiting for the next big MMORPG to come.  We really are ripe for one!
---
It's simply hoarding, yes. I'm working on it^^
---
Good enough for me :) i wish i could buy the expansions, but money theses days is short :( ..... gonna check it out, i hope it can be enjoyable without expansions. 
---
Hail Mary they announced a year ago &amp; had like one update on since
---
Well, *something* is definitely leaking.
---
You're not wrong, but it's not like the WvW community would be opposed to all forms of content. I think it would just require Anet to rethink how they approach content releases for WvW. There's a big drought right now in open world pvp games, and Anet could capitalize with good quality and marketing. 
---
Both excellent choices.  If you don't have strong feelings one way or another, wait until one comes up on sale.
---
I haven’t had any dc issues but I’ve been having crazy pings spikes up to 3000 when I normally sit around 50-100. I was blaming my husband playing ARK because it doesn’t seem to happen when we both play GW2 but maybe it isn’t his fault lol
---
&gt; Either way, we shouldn't be asking the WvW devs for more, but for anet management to dedicate more resources to the team. 
---
I think the devs asking for a bigger team has way more weight behind it compared to the community asking for it that doesn't know anything how the WvW team is working or what they need help with.
---
hell yeah I think having a healthy competitive community would help gemstore sales. but gemstore sales are clearly lucrative enough as it is. we get gemstore updates every week. what we don't get every week is balance hotfixes and minor stat tweaks, and we don't get balance patches every month like actual competitive games.
---
I wouldn't rush to buy or craft Ascended.  Gear up with exotic armor and weapons, use Laurels + Badges to get ascended trinkets and then take your time on the armor / weapons.  Put in enough time if you have it to get your 3 GM shards every week, and hope for the occasional Ascended armor box.
---

[I think it looks good in game too, but yeah. could be better](https://imgur.com/gallery/X0XpcpA) 
---
Alliances without a vision for coverage balance aren't even an improvement to what we have now.
---
It's just bandaids to the problems that arrise because they neglect WvW rather than fixing the real issues. Alliances will NOT include a fix for coverage balance. On top of that, anet isn't willing to reduce the importance of off-prime. 
---
Which means that this clownfiesta will remain, long after alliances hits. They CAN try to aggresively balance alliances towards coverage, but they won't anytime soon. They COULD promote systems other than alliances to really promote a healthy population and balanced coverages (through competition, etc). But again, they won't. 
---
What they're tryin to do is produce a system that is "bearable" for a few more years, and don't piss off their obnoxious leeches too badly, so they can continue to ignore WvW. 
---
They can throw out the entire alliance system and actually work towards something that will; I don't know; allow for healthy long-term groups. Because alliances isn't it. 
---
The msconfig "tip" is ancient snake oil. That setting is for debugging purposes to *limit* the number of processors in the system. Setting it will do nothing for performance, and will potentially only cause issues for you in the future if you upgrade your CPU, leaving you wondering what happened to the new cores.
---
It's not the 90s anymore, "tweaks" are garbage unless you have an explicit issue that needs to be solved, like an iGPU taking priority over your dGPU.
---
My second account is core-only and I got the recipe for exotic Marauder insignias and was able to craft them and stat-change my ascended armor.  As long as a particular insignia or inscription doesn't require account bound HOT or POF materials, apparently you can get those stats.  Won't work for trinkets though.
---
No problem sir =) 
---
&gt;now we finally reached a threshold were less involved people start to notice the symptoms in a big way.
---
Ah yes, finally the "the gaem is always amazin and should quit if you don't like it!!!" crowd is starting to realise they're actually retarded. Entertainment ensues.
---
ah ok, right on. yeah wasn't sure about marauder. glad it works for everyone. it's one of my favourite of the new stat combo's
---
The current cheapest official way to remove account restrictions would be to purchase [Heart of Thorns from DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-29808).
---
Damn onions... :'(
---
hey thanks bro, i really appreciate it. I stream gw2 and knowing awsome looking Hook settlings like this will really help me out with my scenes and overlays i have planned in the future
---
And as it always goes, every time we force dedicated players to go on break for a few months because the game is close to unplayable, more of them quit. 
---
laurel merchant.
---
I regretted my bag slot purchases when i started playing other characters. Better to buy bank tabs. That being said copper fed is an absolute must, and best purchase yet, but only if you only have one character or combine it with a shared inventory slot.
---
So did Anet.
---
^^now I made myself sad
---
RoS had more active commanders before it became the second bandwagon server than after. Getting 2 extra pugmanders while gaining hundreds of players looking to leech doesn't increase the actual activity for its community players. In fact it decreases the availability thereof. 
---
I would love to see a "World Completion" effort! All core maps in Wargroove. For reference, my map is 32x22 tiles.
---
Someone doesn't want to play the game at all it seems.
---
^(TFW you were too lazy to get up and post this so someone else bet you to it.)
---
I thought this was actually going to be an appreciation post on the different creepy crawlies that Tyria has to offer. 
---
This gets posted every week. How did you dismount from the springer midair though?
---
Thanks for the push! I didn't consider posting here beforehand.
---
Which I'm sure is why ANet didn't implement one for HoT maps in the first place. But it's also probably why all the newly released maps are flat desert with the occasional underground level, and not a complicated series of tunnels like TD.
---
Mostly you get champion bags which you open on a Level ~50 character to get T4(?) mats which are the most expensive.
---
In FE each unit is a specific character that develops over the course of the game. They can level up, gain weapon proficiencies, and even die.
---
In Advance Wars, each map is self-contained. The generic infantry unit you have in the first map isn't going to go with you to the next one and develop as a character, and whether they live or die doesn't affect anything as long as you win the map. It makes the game much more amenable to custom maps like this as well since you can control exactly what resources each side has available at the start rather than needing to worry about what level a player is coming in at.
---
Hello slenderman 
---
It's not my problem that its gone, but its a case of when you should turn a deaf ear to the forum criers. They cried, most of the defencive amulets got removed, diversity reduced. The forum criers seem to be dps solo queuers. The cry wanting everything else removed.
---
wait wait wait what free shared bag slot?
---
The likely reason ANet does not prioritize WvW is b/c it doesn’t make enough money for them. If WvW players want more attention to their game mode, spend more money on the game. That’s probably the only thing that will get them to allocate more resources to WvW at this point.
---
You get one for each expansion 
---
Why once a day? For daily or does drop rate reduce after once? 
---
Just checking for clarification.
---
The gloves look really nice in the artwork, but way too bright in the screenshot. Shame, otherwise I would get myself a pair of Chaos gloves to go with my Zodiac Elementalist.
---
most people don't
---
At the end looked like Peaks meta. Please, spare me 😩
---
&gt;Funny cause the rest of the game outside of super easy openworld needs these pillars too.
---
Not really, there's virtually no crossover between the super easy open world and the PvE content where hardcore skill is actually required, so these pillars don't really come into play.
---
If the hardcore playerbase up and vanishes one night, the extent to which the casual player is inconvenienced is that there might be slightly less Commanders around to lead meta events, so you'll start seeing more people leading with Mentor tags and it'll be harder to get carried in T4 Fractals, but the game doesn't collapse.
---
You don't want mediocre players in raids and high end fractals, and you don't need skilled players to kill the Octovine.
---
Huh?
---
I tinker with my reshade settings while repeatedly guiding newer players through caledon forest jps and explorer achievements. 
---
Is there a way to mark yourself (ala the apple or square/shield/etc. in other games) besides mentor or commander? I'd like to increase my visibility from far away because I'm duoing with someone super new to the game. I've been turning on /mentor but that doesn't feel quite like what the mode is.
---
?
---
Im using the games own terms of defining what it is. It is a free to play game, with buyable dlc. The very definition of pay to win is buying an advantage over those who chose not to. They need to come up with another way of incentivizing people to buy the dlc to compete, because if its the only way you can compete, it shows poor balance and lack of build diversity. From the outside it appears pay to win from the inside, its shady and seedy and makes me wanna quit if i cant even play the game without forking over money.
---
i just want them to fix the bugs and pathing issues on all the maps right now...there was a texture bug on garri that they stated was fixed 2 years ago but it wasnt! all the grave errors on permanent siege placements where certain weapons cannot hit them due to the hit box being in the wall etc etc, this is particularly bad in RBL...not to mention the giant gaps still in the RBL garri walls where the OG wooden barriers used to be...yea remember those? thats how long theyve not cared about that issue, not to mention that you can focus pull anyone standing on a RBL wall from anywhere because they are so badly designed, raise the invisible walls to be in line with the other maps at least  
---
  
---
these are all minimal issues to fix imo, that should have been fixed YEARS ago when they were first introduced ie on conception of the map for some of them
---
Copper fed it is worth it. Leave it in your shared inventory
---
&gt; Gladiator applying taunt and siphoning health around them
---
Oh damn, that sounds pretty cool.
---
&gt; everything else
---
I like the idea of having more racial lore integrated into the professions. I don't think people would be upset to be able to have a connection to the Spirits of the Wild when they don't play a norn or to Trahearne when not a sylvari. That kind of cross-race aesthetic can be really awesome, especially this far into the game.
---
Aesthetics sound cool, but the mechanics feel pretty flat. As Zosin pointed out, there's already a lot of overlap between your ideas and existing weapons/specs for the same profession.
---
I’m trying to figure out what your sentence means. You might want to rewrite it, because it does not make sense. 
---
It really shows that you are not a WvWer, or a bad one.
---
I  sent you a message here on reddit! :D
---
Honestly just pop a commander/mentor tag whenever the pre event pops up. Every map can run on a different timer, so if you put a group up in lfg and write in map chat, people will join. The meta itself needs little to no coordination.
---
I led ~50 groups while going for the portal spiker achievement, and I also map hopped a lot to get a quicker spawn on the event (in the case of it bugging/failing). If you have any more questions feel free to ask me (:
---
It could have done. WvW could have been a huge and defining feature for GW2, but that opportunity has passed by.
---
A 6 year old game isn't going to see a huge influx of new players and honestly, WvW isn't consistently fun enough (and hasn't been for years) to attract new players.
---
When match outcomes are known 2 minutes past WvW reset and it's minimally fun to lose, then they can only plan a slow demise.
---
In most cases, when people investigate this issue, it turns out to be a timeout related to your ISP rather than being a bug in the game. This is especially true if you're experiencing the same problem with multiple missions. Many people have resolved this problem by simply using skills or movement actions during cutscenes.
---
&gt;Finding fractal groups will be more difficult. Finding CM groups even more difficult. Finding raid groups will be a pure pain. Raid training groups wouldn't even exist. 
---
Sure, but I was specifically talking about open world PvE. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned Fractals, but I do know *some* casuals who will occasionally do their T4 dailies a few days in a row and that might get a bit harder for them.
---
Open world wouldn't suffer at all, and by all accounts that's where the majority of players are, otherwise it wouldn't be the only content that isn't slowly dying due to neglect.
---
&gt;Which is exactly why the "reee raids are unaccessible" is extra entertaining.
---
This is a good point. if the raiders all vanish then the casuals will have no one to buy raid wins from and raids become completely unaccessible.
---
Yeah, I actually forgot to look into the Ventari skills. I had pretty much no ideas for Trahearne outside of the elite and weapon.
---
I straight up don't have a guardian so I forgot about the torch skills. 
---
Honestly this is why I quit the game you can't have WvW when there are no worlds anymore it use to be a fun struggle getting enough people on your server pin to fight for the glory of your server now it's a hot mess with every server merge for pve and split by guild or shard for PvP. This isn't how it was suppose to be the biggest miss balance and miss chance was arenanet not stepping up sooner to force servers from working together 2 vs 1 and merging the shards in pve causing all shards to lose their identity. Going back if that was their plan they should have had just gvg arenas. Instead WvW will be the bane of the game till the next Guild Wars.
---
I would play more often if they fix damage from long range 1200 or more to do &lt;50% the damage it does now. Its filled with ranger rapid fire 1shot, chrono/mesmer power burst builds. Condi mirage is just a spam fest and single mirage can drop your fps by 15 and health by 15k in a second. There are anti-fun de builds too. Rev hammer damage in zergs is too high for 1200 range, scourge axe 2 damage is also very high and imo necro staff needs complete overhaul in all modes away from marks spam. Scourge staff is single biggest offender for visual clutter on the ground in wvw but thats just my opinion everyone might not agree.
---
I would like to have more variety of maps that have different mechanics for travel and different ways to win towers/keeps/camps. I would suggest make many maps for replacing eternal battlegrounds and cycle through them every week. Also if they can have some sort of verticality and unique environment then that would be awesome to play.
---
my pp weeps for eir :(
---
Any idea when there's going to be another episode?
---
are they back in the store?
---
Daily fractals, Weekly raids and close the game.
---
How far away? Your friend can put the target crosshairs on you, but it's only visible up to a certain distance. The advantage is that only party members can see it. 
---
Besides that there's mentor/commander tags and squad markers. Squad markers only work in squads with a commander. 
---
If you're representing the same guild your names become orange and you can see each others locations on the world map, even if you're not in a group. 
---
Nothing else comes to mind.
---
Yeah Gladiator is meant to be a strange condition tank, having objectively less health while making up for it with the siphon.
---
After looking over what Zosin said yeah there is a lot of overlap, but in my own somewhat defense these are kind of just random thoughts I compiled together for classes I don't really play as. But I will for sure try to get more creative with the next set, since I have all 3 adventurer classes.
---
yes
---
necro got a new 2 hand and a new off hand. next spec will give necro a new main hand. probably sword.
---
Hell yes, sign me up.
---
I hate TD with a goddamn passion.  Its one of the worst designed areas I have seen in any game, and its all compounded by the fact that your map is absolutely useless for helping you navigate.  There are paths you see on the map that don't correspond to your physical location because they exist on a different layer than you're on, but there is no layer of the map itself that corresponds to the layer you're standing on.  
---
Plus the Chak are some of the most annoying enemies to fight in HoT, outside of the Mordrem Snipers.  
---
They did, but didn't at the same time.
---
They developed a way to have dynamic story instances with more checkpoints, and to continue any mission from the last checkpoint instead from the start of the missions.
---
But they never went back to update old missions to this system. So while new content won't suffer from this problem, old content sucks hairly grawl bawls.
---
GW2 definitely needs a "Refurbishing Team" that updates old content with new designs and standards. 
---
Yeah. I just did the entirety of Claw Island twice the other day.
---
"You have been disconnected from the login servers" has become a semi-hourly experience. Then I have to alt tab and kill the process.
---
It's great. Great is the word I would use.
---
So is the big reveal here that Anet's writers sincerely think that Aurene has been in the game for five or so years? 
---
Well, the devs might say all that, I still found the story cheap, with uninteresting characters and character arcs and going against established storytelling conventions in an unimaginative way. And, frankly said, they did not execute this trope breaking story very skillfully.
---
Story was never the strong point of gw2, and this one is just weird.  It's just not good. Whatever.
---
Great segment, keep up the wonderful work. See you in Lion's Arch.
---
[Sending prayers and good vibes](https://i.postimg.cc/9XMkrX5H/dekibztys1f21.jpg)

So many presets, we're not just counting zones. But whole dungeons/fractals/LS areas. 
---
She’s technically been in the story since LS2, if they are counting un-hatched Aurene, which I think they are.
---
So, what? Ban discussion of all storylines in all media ever? Spoilers have a time limit. What that limit is is hazy, but it's less than 12 years.

---
&gt; sure, wvw also had updates, but i'd argue non of them were as significant, or actual efforts to improve the mode, but rather reluctant overdue attemps to keep the bare necessity of interest up in most cases. removal of the orb mechanic, changes to the borderlands lake, mastery system, server linking, participation and piggybacked pip system, and those two very successful and beloved map additions we got. 
---
Anet stated a while back that they were concentrating on content instead of innovation - and I was happy with that decision at the time, but seeing what it meant, I have changed my mind. 
---
HoT brought a tonne of great WvW features, but the backlash about the map and their change of focus meant that WvW got, as the americans like to say, "a goose egg", in PoF. That's why I'm dissatisfied with Path of Fire - it doesn't *delight* me, Mo.
---
GvG tournament . Take the new arena in edge of the mist . Monthly tournament like in pvp (sunday 20/21 h EU time) Weekly tournament for qualification. Easy to implement, the map is already done. Don't favorised migration or burnout that maybe exist by the past. JUST DO IT . Make gvg tournament . 
---
My unformed thoughts:
---
**~~Russell Crowe~~** **Gladiator:**
---
&gt; warriors have very little options left for weapons. So the next logical step would be taking a weapon that already has existing models and putting it on a character who can't use it.  
---
Why not Staff, focus, or scepter then? In particular, I feel ANet's more likely to go with Staff first before underwater weapons. Just my thoughts tho.
---
&gt;  gain access to ~~Glares~~ Weary stares, piercing stares that give debuffs  
---
FTFY.
---
How is this different from a shout-based berserker? We have a denial/tanky spec and an increased-dmg spec. We need to find something *else* a warrior can do. Also, what functionally is the difference between shouts and glares? Do glares require LoS? 
---
**~~Avatar Spirit~~** **Spiritualist:**
---
&gt; it would actually be focused around the Norn Spirits of the Wild. 
---
Gonna say no to that immediately. It *might* work for Sylvari or Humans who are somewhat spiritual, but for Charr and Asura  - the first of whom are misotheist, and the second of whom are not really theist at all - seems too much of a stretch. I feel like the Spirits here are functionally the same as ranger spirits (or renegade summons), but with virtue-tied de-summons?
---
**~~Summon Tresus~~** **Firstborn:** 
---
I *really* doubt ANet's gonna wanna use any character we've encountered as living in the story as a revenant legend, mainly because it creates huge lore problems if you decide to go play old content. And while Trahearne may (or may not) have been an inspirational leader to many Tyrians, was he really legendary? On the same level as the female Charr who broke the back of the Flame legion, or the literal daughter of an elder dragon? I'd also be a little concerned about the greatsword being Yet Another AoE Greatsword™ build.
---
I got that skin. It's account bound on acquiring though.
---
Both is Mai Trin, which is fast as frick if your group is organized 
---
Those two fill-in questions at the end have so many different answers that are mostly variations of the same thing. Gonna be a pain to review all of them. 
---
For favorite content, I put Gathering since it's the most relaxing activity I can think of, and it's what I do when I'm tired from work.
---
I'm not entirely sure why cross posting is disallowed to be honest, more than likely this is just how /u/Attunement chose to initially configure the sub (or potentially an oversight, it's just a check box).
---
You can still create a link post directly to the reddit post in question if it's relevant - which is effectively the same as a cross post. [Here is a recent example of exactly this](https://redd.it/ao8oqi). 
---
i've had posts deleted. my thread deleted. account suspended.   
---
all in order to address feedback. im am way too bitter at this point to address constructive feedback
---
Hey.
---
Do you want the forged staff or not?
---
Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it. I’ll try it when I get home. It’s a little cumbersome on mobile.
---
If you're in a party he can see your direction on the minimap as a blue dot.
---
Sorry if this is a noob question but - my targeting constantly switches enemies as im in the middle of a crazy battle - how do I stop this from happening and just lock onto 1 target
---
Warriors still lack Staff, Focus, Scepter, Shortbow, and Pistol. But none of these really thematically fit the idea of Warrior.
---
 Staff, Focus, and Scepter are all magic weapons and having another melee staff elite would be strange. And while trident is also a magic weapon, they consistently have blades on them to allow them to be used as a stabbing weapon and no other class can use them on land
---
Shortbow is very strange option because by it's nature it is meant to be a nimble, light-on-your-feet weapon. You can argue Rev can use shortbow and they're not exactly light on their feet but Warrior shortbow makes as much sense as Thief hammer.
---
And finally pistol. It was my second idea but I ultimately went with Trident because it sounded more interesting.
---
Maybe there could be an elite where it's a pistol wielding Commander of sorts that gives buffs? But banners already serve that purpose. 
---
I don't trust the balance team ^^#SoulPastry
---
what are you talking about, I'm talking about matthias specifically, when he goes invuln, he still takes damage from conditions, this is partially why it's a condi fight
---
The WvW features they delivered with HoT were accompanied by a mountain of bugs and absolutely horrible WvW changes. The backlash wasn't solely about the map (which was unplayable during the Oasis event and clearly untested at HoT launch) but wide-ranging \_awful\_ fuckups.
---
In the settings there's a ton of options for targeting under the general settings. You might have the one called something like "promote targets hit by skills", basically targeting enemies that you are hitting most ish.
---
Does anyone knows if you can enter Fractals before lvl 80 on a F2P account ? I know about the lvl restriction for LA but not for Fracs.
---
On a female. the male version looks lame with pretty much every armor set unless you dye it all black haha very few armor sets look good on any male chr,

Its pointless they dont got anyone working on it so all ur suggestions are useelss.  U got better chance to play CU and Crowdfall and all the other ones coming out this year than waiting for Alliance lol.  Alliance wont save WvW b/c its still same crap system with PVD=Win.

Gw2 news from a site that brings us:
---
&gt;	Alex Jones And Joe Rogan Are In The Midst Of A Hilarious Feud
---
Ouef
---
There are some I just can’t comprehend. I’m looking to lock onto a target and unless I tab target to the next myself
---
It's still a crackpot theory, but this interview really did make me feel as though there might be more credence to the theory of Aurene's sacrifice being a catalyst for Kralkatorrik's redemption than I had originally thought.
---
Honestly, it seems like they could do pretty much whatever at this point.
---
&gt;  they are not the pre-eminent publishers and mapmakers of Tyria.
---
except they literally have a giant globe in their headquarters?
---
Javelins? I mean it wouldn't be the craziest idea. Rangers have throwing axes that magically return to their hands. Warrior could just throw staves at people and the one given to you for getting the elite has a spearhead. 
---
Tis but a scratch
---
Charr you okay
---
Yep. Same here. 1 extra bag slot is nice, but you shouldn't really need more than 100-120 slots other than if you are opening 3+ stacks of 250 unidentified gear one after the other. Then the extra space is nice. But if you salvage regularly with your copper-fed like I do, you are really fine.
---
I do have over 10 extra stash tabs though. Those are definitely a must after a while.
---
Open up your achievements panel.  It will list the 3 achievements you are closest to completing.  Complete them.  Then try the 3 you are next closest to completing...
---
Torch condi cleanse doesn't hit yourself, though
---
That was... incredible.
---
Clearly they should use the reactions of all the other players who are filming their reactions as they play. Probably loads of those.
---
Hahaha, I don't even log-in for the rewards. I log in maybe once every 2 weeks to play with guildmates and that's it. I got burned out and I'm becoming too old (I lost interest in most online games) to grind all the new gem store stuff.
---
I still sometimes do log-in rewards, but meh...
---
Patches for old story content? HAH! Keep dreaming.
---
Switching a weapon from 2 handed to 1 handed can't work. 2 handed weapons have double the stats of a one hander, and two upgrade and infusion slots. 
---
Except this doesn't only happen in old instances, but new story instances too. I've had a persistent problem with very specific story instances. 
---
My current one is the game crashes at precisely the same point every time I try the final instance in All or Nothing. The only reason I know what happens is because I viewed a YouTube video of the final cut scene. And I have tried everything I can think of locally to successfully complete this instance, but nothing I've done has worked. 
---
I have a support ticket open and we're trying to find the problem. 
---
... Which they shared with the rest of Tyria, as the order of Whispers are well known for spreading knowledge to anyone who asks? 
---
:/
---
They should have went with the concept art behind MikeZ for the Charr elite racial skill
---
It's more like they're a bit disingenuous to play up their reactions for their own audience. There just ends up being a layer of staged performance you can't get past if you want your channel to get attention.
---
I don't know enough about GW2's "content creator" scene to really say much on that specifically. I know from first hand experience with other games and communities that this is what ends up happening, though. That, and filmed reactions to stuff in general are generally really cringey, staged, or just otherwise ehhhh... 
---
I have 34" 3440x1440 screen, curved and with 100Hz refresh rate and ... I have mixed feelings. The character selection screen is not scaled correctly, its just scaled both horizontaly and then verticaly to keep 16:9 ratio, so bigger characters are missing heads, or they are only half visible. In game, the videos are centered/cropped on the sides, but the world rendering is correctly using 21:9 with wider field of view. But this bigger field of view has performance cost, more stuff is rendered. I have Core i5 8600K CPU and I played on radeon RX580 until today and the performance was not really good enough. In emptier areas I could get to 100FPS, but even with few people around the FPS starts to drop. In LA it was barely 40-50 FPS. Today I got new Radeon VII and ... the performance is not better at all. i can enable more eye candy in Graphics settings, but the CPU is bottlenech, engine needs more CPU. I still have to run with medium character limit, because anything higher makes WvW unplayable.

But "You have been disconnected from the login server" isn't an actual disconnect from the game. o.O
---
You just won't be able to use TP, gemstore and the friendlist, but that's it. You are still able to play the game.
---
Have you tried repairing your GW2 install? This spaghetti coded mess likes to shit itself on regular basis, so it's best to launch it in repair mode just to be sure.
---
Do you mind if I... touch it? 
---
I actually completed crafting it last week. Realised I’d been stockpiling watchwork sprockets for two+ years from my home instance node. 
---
The real drag was the volume of blade shards you need which don’t really drop so you have to convert from sprockets st an absurdly low rate 50 sprockets = 10-15 shards.
---

as a huge WvW lover(been playing wvw mainly for 3 years) I gotta say I want Anet to see more into wvw and not just balance classes based off pvp/pve and still force it onto us wvw players. some things are a bit stronger in wvw than pvp, vice versa but like I said, I want the Anet devs to look a bit more into the balance mainly but im sure they got a table full of things for other stuff as well lol
---
Nobody was afk.
---
This could also be seen as Anet gloating that they made their players sad.
---
right!!! and every time i submit a ticket- they give me a new excuse as to why its MY fault that i'm dc'ing RIGHT AT THE END of a story instance. it made me procrastinate YEARS to finish the main story. i dc'd once after the 45 minute PoF scene where you're in the underworld- no check points there! 
---
I had similar sudden lockups or crash.  Only in GW2, usually on screen load or first toon movement.
---
Memory tested OK.  Windows files no corruption.  GPU mem OK.  CPU checked OK.
---
Windows event Viewer, Windows Log, System indicated Kernel-Power.
---
I replaced desktop PC 5 yr old power supply with newer having higher wattage.  No probs since.
---
Check the other stuff, but don't neglect the Windows Event Viewer.
---
 
---
The core game is not a 2019 game, it's a 2012 game. HoT is not a 2019 game, it's a 2015 game. PoF is not a 2019 game, it's a 2017 game and most of the missions in PoF have checkpoints that save your progress. 
---
So, what you're really complaining about is they haven't gone back and modified all of the 2012 and 2015 content to include checkpoints even though the 2012 content is now all free content.
---
You break it, I break you.
---
WvW was the main reason I bought this game. I haven't gone into the mists except to teach my 7yo how to troll people with Ballistas in over 3 years. It's a total disaster and Anet had an amazing opportunity in the beginning.
---
New WvW meta, all scourges.
---
Overall I think they need to spend some effort into WvW, being map, mechanics, reward system, and such. From an "outside" point of view, WvW development is just non existent...
---
So you can't log in into game at all before next episode comes out? (2 months or so) well that's a shame. Then you will have to spend some $$$.
---
OMG YES PLEASE!! I did the Hidden Arcana story instance NINE TIMES today!!
---
Every single time I disconnected after the very last cutscene. 
---
Could also be you clicking them when moving your point of view. I do that all the time. Super annoying. There may (I can't remember) be a way to make right click not click. And that could help. 
---
I’ll check those things out once I’m back at my pc next week :)
---
I sincerely doubt you've killed 3,000 since starting the collection, but if it's not bugged it *is* enitrely possible you got super unlucky.
---
Well, this is the problem: your gear. 
---
Meta for druid in fractals is Harrier’s gear with Monk runes. You need the concentration and both healing power. 
---
Watch some videos on druid gameplay. There isn’t much to it, but some basics you should know. Focus on gear first though.
---
I weirdly thought the episode had very little emotional impact. Dunno.
---
I mean it was very obvious this'd happen, and the way they cut out from that "big impact" to a frozen-in-time zone 5 seconds later... let's say it didn't help the emotions. They erased it all right after and now the world is back to where Aurene is fine and we're just running around grinding shit.
---
Nah, let it go already. That game mode isn't going to be interesting without a complete overhaul and that isn't going to happen. Just let it go die in peace.
---
Is there a good build site, specifically holosmiths? I don't think I know what I'm doing. Also, best way to get ascended gear? Bought some with laurels, working on armor smithing. Second question: because of the scaling, mow much does gear even matter? And where the shit do I get exotic accessories?
---
could you post your build here? Use the [gw2skills build editor](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) or some sort of build display so we can see if there's anything there.
---
Other than that, since you don't have concentration, buffs aren't going to be easily maintained at 100%. 
---
So let's pay attention to your healing. Are you making sure that people are near you when you're healing? Are you making use of your celestial avatar whenever you need to? Are you just staying on staff permanently and hoping that your autoattack can provide enough healing?
---
I agree. I don't really understand the shock but I guess I'd already given up on the episode due to the shoe-horned plot conveniences because everything needs to be crammed into one episode. I miss having the current events for build up since then the bloodstone spear /Zephyrite choir/ dregde sonic weapon stuff wouldn't have felt so rushed and more of the episode could have focused on the countless other more important reveals (the prophecy, Caithe's connection) that sadly led to a bloated the episode. 
---
Mighty Teapot's reaction was the best. I'm surprised he didn't make the cut!
---
Currently returning to the game, i am lvl 70 with some gear, working towards the Ascended gear created through Tailoring for my class ( weaver ). Was just wondering if there are any small communities out there that doesnt mind helping a guy out with stuff after ive done the story in HoT complete :o
---
"Can't wait for my duty to be over already...."
---
wow, this actually made my eyes water.
---
I think there's achievement points for doing the first stories, before you leave your starter towns. 
---
Other than that, some collections in HoT/PoF (PoF amnoon banners, HoT pact backpacks) can only be done if you've done the story with multiple characters, and some collections are easy to finish if you do the story with multiple characters (auric weapons, chak weapons)
---
So why grill gamers only and why lock the comments?
---
Depending on exactly what you want to do, primary stats for druid are healing power and concentration. Healing power is important if you want heal and concentration is important if you want to grant boons. 
---
To both heal and grant reliable boons you want Harrier gear. You will need PoF and is a bit tricky to fully gear if you are doing this from scratch. 
---
If you want to only heal you can use magi's gear. This stat set is healing power (primary), vitality and precision (secondary). This a core game stat and is easy to gear. Cleric's stat is basically the same except it has toughness instead of vitality, so can interfere with tanks taking aggro in organised content. 
---
With magi gear you can get a pretty reasonable amount of boon duration through sigils, runes and food/utilities, but harrier gear will give you better boon uptime. 
---
Look for a guild! Mine was instrumental in helping me understand and enjoy the end game.
---
&gt; But hey, everyone here feels attacked on a personal level if something they like gets criticised, not surprising. Just like the story.
---
Kinda hard to argue that point when part of your critique was literally trying to criticize the people who enjoyed it;
---
&gt; If it had any impact on you, you gotta seriously ask yourself how many good stories you actually heard, read, played or watched in your life, for comparisons sake.
---
xD
---
&gt; And alliances to far off and and rushing it to be something half done or worse is not a choice either. But Arena Net can act now. They can merge small servers in to the larger one so we have less servers and stop this link madness that is doing more damage then good and weaken WvW.
---
I agree that more needs to be done now given alliances are taking so long, I'd settle for reducing the number of tiers in NA.
---
Eir, Blish, Aurene . Anet, stop killing. 
---
Mostly standing in LA looking through LFG only to find nobody in the fractals tabs, nobody in the HoT map meta tabs, then going open world for a bit for random materials and stuff, and logging off. Send halp i wanna do content too
---
You might be onto something with the PSU because I already had a 1000w one from several years ago so I didn't see a reason to get a new one. I'll check all the things you mentioned after memtest86 is done. It's on the last pass and hasn't found any errors.
---
It looks so good.
---
LMAO
---
This would be fine if alliances were being done in a reasonable time frame but anet saw fit to make major changes without devoting any new resources to it. This has lead to the timeframe blowing out to a completely unacceptable length which itself leads to players leaving.
---
MMOs where development devolves to only focussing on 1 aspect of the game fail.  
---
Devs want to make PvE or Mount Skins :D They don't seem to understand they could be doing similar things in WvW to better game.
---
Some direct answers to your questions. You can get your ascended gear through crafting, but it's also possible through raids and fractals. Certain pieces are also available through vendors, especially in LWS3 maps. You can buy stat selectable ascended rings and accessories through one of the fractal vendors.
---
Due to scaling, the difference between exotic and ascended gear isn't huge, but in order to do most fractals you have to have ascended.
---
And your final question depends on your desired stat combo, so I'd recommend using the wiki for that one.
---
Wrong grass starter.
---
Zho's armor is Cleric's (HP, Toughness, Power), which should provide enough healing power to get started. 
---
I think the build, and it's usage is likely the main issue. 
---
/u/Sinful-Angelius what build are you using? Are you running the [meta build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Healer_(Fractal)) or something of your own making? If it's the later can you show it in this [build editor](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/)?
---
It’s 0 for me after they killed joko off in such a lighthearted way. Really stopped caring at all about story 
---
The big issue is that there is no reconnect option, something we had back in 2005 in Guild Wars...
---
#BringGvG back. It allows more hardcore players to have a reason to play the game and have more endgame stuff. Reason why people fluctuate a lot is having nothing to do after doing all PvE content.  
---
GvG is what made GW1 great. Pls arenanet 🙏
---
*Dunks head underwater to look at all the Spear Models...*
---
Yeah. that could work.
---
2005 content from Guild Wars can reconnect properly after a dc...
---
Thank you that page is very helpful
---
I just remember him blabbing "something something LEY ENERGY"
---
I agree it is a growing issue overall were players want a daycare center to go to that will entertain them but they do not want to make effort them self. 
---
How you know it’s only two people?
---
I think you need to own the chapter to get to the map or do the story. I remember someone trying to teleport to me in Bitterfrost, but it didn't work since they didn't own the living story episode.
---
Oh so its not just me and my shitty conncetion
---
It can't be 100% on A-Net's side or else EVERYONE would suffer the same fate. I've NEVER d/ced at the end of an instance outside of the one or two bugs on RELEASE day. Hell, I recently did a full 1-80 +plus exp+seasons on an alt and never d/ced once.
---
In Guild Wars 1 in you had a DC, there was a possibility of being put in straight back where you were (a box would appear when connection comes back prompting you to get back into the game).
---
No excuse why they can't do that in GW2.
---
Definitely should have made the cut over WP. 
---
Anet's milking the suffering porn for all its worth.
---
that's what will happen if you manually target an enemy (or autotarget an enemy with 'promote skill target' checked). targetting wont change unless you tab/click another target/click the environment (or the rare instance where an enemy uses the Taunt effect one you)
---
Interesting thought, what if killing Kralkatorrik in the mists releases the energy "safely" there, and all excess is absorbed by Glint, Vlast and Aurene (as Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik's energies surely can't be all taken into one baby dragon), essentially safely storing it outside the realm of Tyria?- as it prevents the remaining three from stealing it?
---
I would have loved learning more about the zephyrites. 
---
You get the default chest in the end. So 19 relics, some +1 agony infusions and a few encryptions. The small chests for each boss is obly obtainable once daily.
---
So it was not worth it xD
---
Because the entirety of GW 1 was instanced. The engine infrastructure dealing with online connectivity has a lot more to deal with now than before including open world data. Most likely this was a compromise to get it running.
---
WP, Deroir and the other spanish one are grills? 
---
You really have your priorities right
---
I like DBL o_o
---
 it only took 2 years
---
Troll or ? What was disgusting?
---
Yeah you don’t get the daily bouncy chests more than once per day
---
with that green it looks more like Emerald...
---
Doesn't look like ogden...
---
Well yeah.  You don't think Stephen King gloats about how he scares his readers?
---
And once someone will check and post the result here... Pandora's open.
---
That happened to me so many times when I first did the personal story. The final instance was hard enough without having to do it 10 times due to random DCs.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---

For any story chapter, only those who have unlocked the content in their account will get rewards from intances. 
---
For season 3 and 4 you won't even be able to enter the map without owning the episode.
---
I'd recommend getting the episodes one or two at a time for the both of you. Take your time playing the story, completing the map, and getting the achievements, then get the next 1-2 chapters.
---
They are only 200gems per episode, so if you get the chapters instead doing something else like going to the movies once a month, you'd be able to get 2-4 episodes per month each.
---
Yeah but captain marvel and end game tho 😂
