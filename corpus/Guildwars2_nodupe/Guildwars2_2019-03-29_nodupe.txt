I didn't scroll as far up as I should have, so what? I never did say anything to warrant the harassment. You can ask the devs for my chat logs as proof if you're that small minded.
---
---
---
Gonna be a nightmare for Anet to figure this out on the back end lol. 
---
You literally intruded on organized play, and they asked you to leave multiple times, you should learn the culture of a community before screaming about it. GvG's aren't something anyone can join
---
I mean it was discovered on streams within about 2 mins of the patch.
---
to Cantha.
---
Been waiting for the exo suit outfit to be back in store but then again I got winter's presence a few months ago and it's not visible on the outfits...
---
Stop describing me
---
The skill needs to be reworked if they want to make it a support skill. Even in the bugged implementation that it was post-patch, it wasnt enough barrier to tank damage properly.
---
You are wrong. End of story.
---
Hell yeah
---
Yes, because deleting something is as difficult as fixing something. Not.
---
YES! 
---
Assuming computers work the same way in GW2 as they do in the real world, Blish was dead before we ever met him.

"Moving" data from one storage unit to another is an inaccurate colloquialism, no matter what form it comes in data doesn't actually occupy space, and cannot be moved.  Think of it like writing, when you say you're copying notes you're not actually copying them, you're creating them over again on a new sheet of paper.
---
Similarly when you "move" data from one storage unit to another, you're not actually moving anything, you're effectively recreating it in a second storage unit identical to the original, and then deleting the original to create the illusion that it was "copied" instead of recreated.
---
The saddest thing is, Taimi and Gorrick are more than intelligent enough to know that's how data works, they're just in complete and utter denial about the death of their brother and friend.
---
You are *never* gonna convince me that the dodge jump onto the pillar by the purple ninja in 2-2 is the best choice.
---
spent about 30 mins bouncing off the pillar randomly only to do it in 2 with the normal path :p

One per account for Level 10.

You cannot repeat *any* story step to get rewards on the same character.
---
Amazing design!! 
---
not many will get the reference hahaha.
---
Thanks for all your hard work man, why I became a Patreon supporter of yours. Keep up the great work!
---
Yes? It's a story step. It's *made* to be solo.
---
If you mean the challenge note, then still yes. It's not even significantly harder, just longer as stuff has more HP. 
---
Mystic Forge Stones, not Spirit Shards. Although I still have a ton.
---
I've got used to clicking my skills 7-10 but I have F1 and healing skill bound to Q and E respectively. That way I can keep my left hand at WASD all the time without need to stretch my fingers in weird positions (I'm really bad at this, I usually prefer controller for 3rd person games)
---
I love the coloring style! 
---
Thank you so much.
---
If they only kill characters you hate, it doesn't have the same resonance.
---
I myself hate the light skin one. 
---
Ugg so evil to require Tribulation Mode for annual events. T.T
---
Thank you Dulfy and crew and all your crowd sourced helpers!
---
You actually only need 4 of the annual ones listed to get the mini reward and AP for the annual. Doing trib just gets you a few more bauble bubbles. Unless I’m missing something.
---
A sentinel achievement. Bravo

That's not really OP's criticism here though

Is the event live????
---
ew incel
---
no, you are missing the backpieces
---
I wonder if they still have that costume lying around somewhere.
---
A new speedrunner is born. Huzzah!
---
I don't know you, but if I had to guess it would be activities (~2000 for all that shit) and the 10 months of daily and monthly achievements you missed (~3000 and ~1000 respectively). Also not sure how much of the living world season 1 you missed out on, but they weren't as stingy with the achievement points back then, and it amounts to about 2700 if you got them all. No longer available now, though. 
---
You buy it from a vendor, I think world 1 zone 2 if I’m not mistaken?

you can see which zones and items you have unlocked so far on every character on gw2efficiency.

Getting revealed at best.

U should also remember that chronos spam etherial fields 24/7 which means even more confusion for mirages when they use axe 2.

Anyone else seeing *the gif*?
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, weapon swap, special action. sure, engi, ele, rev, necro (even more if we count specific elite specs) have more skills available, but they all are restricted to these 17 keybinds.
---
90% of probably 10% of the player base that actually even reads the patch notes. 
---
This guy’s got the right idea
---
\&gt; Big Ol' Bomb
---
This idea is dumb and I don't have to tell you why
---
No. 1. He mentions one episode a week for the welcome back event now if this was evidence and Anet knew after week 5 we would be getting episode 6 they would have named it the road to the finale. 
---
I thought you were in GAL lmao

I got nothing against BGA, you guys are good. You make great bags =D

Just want to add for Fractals: I suggest building the good habit of doing CA2&gt;CA3 everytime in CA. Not only is CA3 a spike heal, blasting the light field of CA2 is an AoE condi cleanse. 
---
I've seen too many druids in T4 struggling to condi cleanse, resulting wipes. Usually when that happens, I switch from playing DPS to my druid and have no problem low man completing the run (usually the other druid would be the first to drop heh). 
---
By Ogden's hammer, what OC!
---
Whereas North Dakota has like.. 15 people in it, and they all want out.
---
Holy shit congrats! I'm at 5k hours and been playing since beta weekend. You have over double my time and I already feel like I've invested sooo much into this game. 
---
Couple questions..
---
Do you play any other games or just GW2?
---
What profession is your overall favorite?
---
If you play WvW, what server do you represent?
---
[removed]

Are the missing icon mats mithril ore? They're next to the other t5 mats and above orichalcum ore.
---
The first two NPCs were; they’re parked next to Moto in Rata Sum (which was handy for condensing baubles from [the home instance node](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bauble_Gathering_System).  This new vendor? No idea; there are reasons for and against whether they would be.
---
**For the train, please make sure you have:**

---
But both on tribulation mode
---
Has anybody hit the 60,000 AP mark yet?
---
Is it even possible?
---
Just wanted to reply to this and state I didnt take it personally.  It's a fair point.  The only reason I included the time parameter is that this method was known, amongst many others, as soon as the mastery system was introduced.  Many of those other methods (remember the spider farm for HoT mastery?) were patched out while this one has never been touched.
---
Here's the thing Josh Forman the legend who created SAB in the first place is no longer with Anet.

gw2 computers dont work like real computers; its magitech; also the laws of death arent the same; revenants channel long dead heroes/creatures whilst completely lucid spirits inhabit the mists
---
never forget.
---
weve seen necromancy and golemancy combine multiple times (oola and the inquest)
---
taimi and gorrik absolutely fine with blishs condition despite being smart enough in universe to realise a facsimile
---
asura tech has repeatedly interfaced with magic (or been openly powered by magic); waypoints tap into the leyline system, balthazar magically inserted himself into taimis-omadds machine and weve powered up golems with all sorts of magic (notably at ratanovus)
---
That's 1.5 years within the last 6.5 years.
---
Lordy.

Oof
---
I was inspired for about 5 mins, during which I took a look at my upcoming achievement rewards and then all the tedious crap I'd have to go do and then I had a big sigh and went back to being bored.

Can you explain why? Seems like you only have something to say if the person you're talking to has tits and needs your validation =D

Were you doing Infantile mode? Dig spots and "complete x level" achievements don't work in Infantile. 
---
Ah yes. I totally got that joke before reading this comment. 
---
Because logically no one would ever in their right mind simply take a dps firebrand with concentration over just hhaving a couple healer dbs and just have more scourges. Your entire guild does basically no damage. It's absurd in the entire video you guys pull off extremely sub par damage.
---
They work in the other two?
---
Ok gusie, listen.
---
You can switch back and forth between the boomerang and the whip at the prize dispenser
---
Yep!
---
This should be illegal
---
I see so many low effort memes make it to the top of this sub that the inconsistency mystifies me.
---
There are literally pictures of a random environmental thing with the words "I forget how beautiful this game is sometimes" that get so many upvotes.
---
At least you're Ascalonian man, you've got that Rurik privilege. Try being Elonan or Canthan for a day

If u could run this with arc dps it would be  a no brainer :(

From a sci-fi POV, this bbn isn't how time travel works.

I think the gloves are a bit out of place tbh, and the boots don't match as well as they could with the leggings imo.
---
Otherwise looks good. I mean, human female isn't really unique or anything to turn heads but, doesn't mean you can't take pride in trying to make it fashionable.
---
For an even more layman comparison, that’s 5-6 hours every single day. Yikes.
---
You see those warriors from Elonia? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
---
I think you should be able to dye all backpieces
---
If you can log in to account. Arena.net, you can manage your GW2 login credentials
---
I always see “Elementalist” on the patch notes and get excited, then I realize it’s some tiny thing like “Fixed a tooltip on this skill no one uses”
---
impotent rage? I'm very confused at your uneducated and simply ignorant statements lmfao. 
---
you realize we're discussing gw2 and how much of a moron you are yea? You realize you as an individual are considered a joke to most people on gw2.
---
Most people are at work when patch hits and they want to know *immediately* whether they should be angry
---
Also super curious why you're making it sound like only fat people go on diets.. and only incels fap to porn lmfao.
---
are there any non-speed run routes? I don't mind taking a little longer but some of these jumps and hazards are so incredibly inconsistent (not your fault I know, its the janky edges in the game &gt;_&gt;)
---
for good. 
---
You pretty clearly have some rage issues you express by anonymously shitting on people online. You still havent given a reason for why you would run guards as your main healer when you have scrappers. You keep avoiding the question to sidebar. 
---
     
---
If I gave a damn what your guild thought I wouldn't continue to post videos. Fortunately there's more people playing than you 20 edgelords.  Which twat of the bunch are you?
---
The thing is i know that but if you die while the adventure is up it gets rid of that option in the top right so you have to basically restart the zone again.

&gt;Caudecus wasn't such a bad guy you know? He kept the children fed and the widows taken care of. Saw him tip a butler 5 gold once!!

What does one farm / get from doing SAB? The weapon skins?

Anyone know how to disable that diamond that pops up every time I open my inventory

Also the boomerang fails to hit alligators because its vertical hitbox

Whats a spoiler tag? And yes Im a gamer that doesnt know that. Hubby has carried and taught me everything to be able to play. First real vid game really got into.

Think Ima take pic of it on my phone with comp. Dunno how to prove I took pic...

And here I was impressed that I had reached 2700 hours

That also happened to me at w2z3

Make sure you come check out /r/champiheroes!
---
They are plain better, no more clunky pathing, no more erratic behavior, they don't die either.
---
Only ugly gyro right now is function gyro imo, it's disgustingly niche even for an elite spec mechanic.
---
Gon'na
---
Yeah I preferred the whip to the boomerang. It made the rapids a lot easier. You can still semi-stunlock the first enemy with the boomerang, but it's more unreliable than the whip was.
---
I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
---
What?
---
I fucking love it. Goodluck anon.
---
Function gyro is decent in PvE for rezzing allies during world bosses, but compared to other elite specs it's pretty garbo
---
It isn't a requirement, chump.
---
Nice you rez one person out of the 10 that died to a boss auto every 20 seconds.
---
in general
---
+no chance of death
---
+more reliable
---
... but that comes with caveats, cleanse gyro whilst does a fantastic job at cleansing; now has an annoying light field, bulwark gyro has a big identity crisis in that its a defensive support skill that you only want to use solo because itll kill you otherwise, shredder gyro still feels undertuned and blast gyro should be an implosion (pull) rather than an explosion (knockback) so it actually synergises with its support capabilities and scrappers melee brawler nature
---
Same here, haven't gotten confirmation e-mail yet - changed the newsletter settings about 10 hrs ago (checked in all the newsletters).
---
Of course, but considering how tricky these dodge-jumps were, I don't really blame anyone for assuming that plenty = all of them:
---
&gt; I also polished plenty of hard jumps so dodge-jumps are no longer necessary there.
---
i just hit 5k today, and that seemed crazy. 36k is an incredible achievement. Congrats.

Creepy and cool

They did nerf it by 33% in pvp only 2 days back as there the patch notes iirc. Honestly the bunker build was ridiculous in pvp. Sneak gyro got nerfed both in pvp and wvw. 
---
It really should give barrier based on how many allies are effected by the field.  For example, if no one is in the AoE, it gives a weak barrier, but for every ally within the field it gives more barrier to the scrapper.  Either that, or make the barrier it gives have a higher healing power mod so it's not just a 'press to die' button in wvw.
---
Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I’ve played fresh air for years, but a sword on Ele is just too enticing. I’ve tried a lot of different builds, still trying to work on a sword/fresh air Elementalist that just isn’t a one-shot wonder.
---
I want Rytlock to bust into my bedroom from the depths of hell to have a radical time.
---
Impressive! I just hit 35k... It gets a lot harder at this point
---
Yea, you can play Scepter Focus Weaver in ranked if you're good enough at it and using your surroundings, I play almost strictly Weaver in ranked. Obviously leaderboard placements mean jackshit, but I got 4 accounts in the top 20 on just Fresh Air Weaver.
---
Theres also a nice Sword Focus build thats gone a bit more mainstream lately that can spike up to 10+ burns in a matter of 2 seconds. I'll link some builds below and you'll probably find one you're a fan of. You can play any Weaver build that doesn't run Water without a healing power amulet, but as soon as you take Water, take healing power the synergy is too good.

Just FYI there is a cap of 15k on daily and monthly AP, most players who are 30k+ will have already hit that.
---
I mean if you work 8 hour days, that is basically spending your free time in the evening playing the game. It just means not doing much else
---
I just read the mesmer skills and leave out the other classes, even with icons i wouldnt know what the skills do
---
Click on Account then Characters.  
---
Theres a big link at the top with a Continue Coin icon beside it that says to check your unlocks for SAB.
---
i had it there but figured my guildies wouldn't be able to do it easily so i modified it :D
---
 These are the new SAB (Super Adventure Box) scribing decorations for  2019 for our guild halls. I've done a quick search for new decs and  these are the 5 that stand out.   I've included a pumpkin and flagpole for scale to reference alongside  these decorations in this video. 
---
\&gt;Didn't even place in the fanciest cat contest
---
Right, I'm just saying it's not as unreasonable as you might think if you were say, an spvp player swimming in hundreds if not thousands of transmute charges.
---
Why fire over lightning? Just curious? I like the lightning for the added “power” feel while being able to do consistent condition damage as well. But I have used fire before to spam blinds, just curious why it outshines air
---
make sure you did not unpack the archive
---
Firebrand scourge always go hand in hand together 
---
Oh and an additional question (sorry to bombard ya with questions) but even in the years I’ve played Elementalist with constant duels and different builds, I still find it incredibly difficult to manage mesmers. Any tips?
---
Nope I didn't. I downloaded and put in poi folder. I think I'll remove it and put the previous one back in (I keep all the previous downloads) and see if it works right. 
---
For the Auspicious Hat, I completed W1Z1 Checkpoint 3 but the rainbow path by the cave didn't appear (as in the image). How do you get that rainbow to appear? Otherwise I can't see how to jump up to the cave.

Cute !
---
How are those Adventure trails coming? :P

&gt; sorry to bombard ya with questions

anyone who admits to have 4 weaver accounts in top 20 deserves to be bombarded with questions

Yikes indeed.

rev and guard are a good pair

Well, a lot of people react salty because mobile games are usually despised by pc or console gamers. 
---
But let's be honest:
---
Many mobile games out there are using 3D Worlds atm and I think I don't need to tell any people how much money they could make with it.
---
I mean. Srsly. If I would be back at school and sitting in a bus for 2hrs a day, I would play the shit out of this game. Even now if I would use busses or anything for my daily commute.
---
I don't say Mobile games are good, or the next big thing or whatever. But I could imagine many many people play it in one way ir the other :) 
---
Oomph, polygons!
---
Oh yeah that too, so many of the shields are so ugly because of the fact you can't dye them
---
Sometimes you have to learn to let it go
---
Literally anything works in ranked
---
Id be much more inclined to craft certain legendaries and collect certain backpieces if they were just freakin dyable

Who do you think was that charr in third comics?
---
TacO comes with some markers pre-installed and among those you have SAB Tribulation markers (little green stars) and you can activate those on top of Tekki's routes. Most of the times those stars will offer you a safer longer alternative when it exists.
---
Congratulations Mate! 
---
You are livin' my dream. I am still stuck at 17k AP and having the impression that i already did every major Achievement.
---
I have 4/6 done and new quest items as well:-) I was expecting one adventure :-D
---
By default diamonds are the "personal custom markers" and they put down when you hit "+" on your keyboard. To remove them you can go near one and hit "-". Then I would reocmmend changing the custom marker or inventory hotkey.
---
She's got a team of skritt helping her out
---
Thank Joko not kormir
---
You most likely have it as key for placing markers. In TacO menu just change keybinds:-)
---
Thank you, I must have been blind! I now know what to look out for.

The asura are a race of diminutive artisans who secretly dwelt below-ground for thousands of years until the minions of the Great Destroyer forced them out of their underground homes in 1078 AE. Since then, they have adapted to surface life and quickly established themselves as one of the most powerful races in Tyria.
---
The asura are one of the five playable races in Guild Wars 2.
---
I will make today detours for "easier paths" but really there are only 3 places where they exist, rest is just Tribulation difficulty:-P
---
My pleasure:-P
---
W2z2 is awful in trib. Good thing is that whoever designed it ran out of hatred while making z2 and thus z3 seems relatively easier.
---
From [BenP on the forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72418/updated-upcoming-warclaw-bug-fixes-changes)
---
&gt;We're going to remove the jump on dismount. It's one of the biggest things used to bypass walls/gates and it was faster to remove the jump rather than try to fix each of those individually. - Partially Done 3/26 - We know there are several other bugs that allow people to get a similar effect to the automatic jump on dismount. It's so far been a hard bug to crack, but we're working on it.
---
and
---
&gt;We know there are still several areas people can break in to keeps/towers or otherwise get to places you shouldn't be able to. [...] We'll be fixing these as we find them. Many will probably be able to be fixed whenever we find a fix for the other ways to jump upon dismount.
---
The key is action camera:-)
---
Don't click restart, just wait a bit
---
M'weed
---
Try it with clean taco installation. I've got some reports that it may not be compatible with some other packs. I'm working on a solution for that but it won't be done for a while.
---
True. I went back to the 'classic' route. Takes longer but it's safer.
---
You can collect baubles with the boomerang but maybe it is more sensitive to height difference. However if you are roughly at the same level the range of the boomerang is way bigger to catch stuff.
---
They added multiple meshes in this path so except one dodge jump in W2Z2 are others no longer necessary
---
Your don't have to play 11k hours to get 36k ap though :) 
---
I have a bit more than half of his time spent in the game and I'm already at 33k5 ap while being lazy with achievements and not capped yet on daily ones. 
---
W2Z3 is worse imo. That ice everywhere...
---
It was already confirmed that both raid and fractal releases are tied to the living story. Considering we got fractal with the last one and since w7 was already in production by the time they released w6 I am confident that we re getting the next wing with the next episode.
---
&gt; As a result, if the balance of professions is not good, a large number of players will switch to the most successful profession. We saw it with Tempest, with Weaver, with Deadeye, with Scourge and currently with Mirage. Therefore, professions absolutely need to be within a reasonable range of damage output otherwise people will feel that they cannot, and should not, play what they enjoy. That the current power professions that are more difficult to play have a slightly higher maximum DPS output is absolutely fine - they cannot be much further ahead in a game with the design of Guild Wars 2.
---
This is exactly what happened - a large number of players switched to the more successful professions. The statistics are there. And you can be absolutely sure a lot of them did it precisely for the extra power and they do feel they cannot, and should not, play what they enjoy. If what you say was true, we'd see roughly even numbers across used power dps buids. However, this is not the case - the numbers are very clearly and heavily in favor of the easy builds.

you don't need to read the patch notes to know every time that whiny PvPers got a bunch of already weak shit nerfed because they thought playing against it was too hard.

My mesmer was a she.

Another two that can be combined. Then combine it with Eternity to get a super duper ultra galactic legendary GS. With planets orbiting your character.

I believe this was added last year.

This video explains about this Chaos God in depth.
---
Yeah, I know it's a throwback--which is why I knew to /dance in the first place. The hidden statue in Desolation will kill you outright, but then that's in line with your theory about not being able to bypass downstate preHOT. 
---
Mostly just thought it was fun and thought I'd share for anyone else who hadn't seen the opportunity when they played LWS2.5. 
---
Never heard of this, how does it work, can I use it to help me?
---
?
---
It was granting 10700 barrier in 2 seconds (post-update). 
---
They bugged it so that the values were both 100% and 66% simultaneously (aka live + post-patch combined). This patch was in order to remove the 100% value.
---
The reason for the nerf was the fact, again, that you could gain 10700 barrier (with menders) in ~4 seconds on a 20 second cooldown with little effort for sustainability. 
---
It rewarded terrible play with an overpowered result. Things like this should not exist, because it caters to poor decision making and skill management. 
---
The class in itself needs more change to make it less "underdog"-like. Bulwark gyro and excessive amounts of barrier don't do much for the class when ultimately it plays like trash. 
---
IIRC typing /gg in chat will simply kill you (the actual command is /resign gg being a popular shorthand).
---
It is intended for conceding defeat faster particularly in raids, however in SAB it does help with getting back to previous point in a level.
---
How does the acquisition of the Mega-Bomb and Boomerang work on additional characters after the first? Can you just acquire all items again even though collections are account-bound? Or do you automatically unlock them with the Mini Bomb / Whip?
---
Also, before I do something I'm going to regret: Can you still permastun the assassin on the raft in W2Z1 with the Boomerang?
---
I have to disagree. It is VERY unlikely that s1 will be made available. Anet stated that they rather work on new content instead of revisiting old (outdated) content. While s1 had some story moments its just not worth it to retell an old story instead of focusing on new story (my opinion). 
---
Furtermore we know for a fact that anet wants to focus on living world instead of expansion type content. We also know that the actual gw2 team was getting smaller and smaller to get other unannounced projects going. 
---
And about your point with SAB in another comment. It did not return for 2 years because technical updates weren't specifically meant for SAB broke it and they had to fix a lot of it.
---
Fresh air scepter ele can work if you are good. You have to work a lot harder, and be better than the people you are playing though. 
---
You rely on the superspeed from iar attunement swap to kite. You need to know allo the no port spots. 
---
Once a decent team realises you are fresh air you may get focused and farmed though. It isn't great against 1vs1 specs, adn dies quickly to a +1.
---
The burst as far as I remember is something like arcane blast in earth for the immobilise, then air attunement twice for the lightning, then fire for the air fire 3. Or from fire phoenix, air attunement for lightning, air/fire 3.
---
In some ways I prefer core fresh air ele, as you have easier access to focus survival skills and more healing if you take water. I only like weaver for twist of fate, and air/fire 3. Normally the build I play is air/ arcane/weaver.
---
I am happy to see people still playing it though when I do see it. I wish it was a bit better. It seems a bit like rev in some ways that they are either terrible or amazing. 
---
If you want to watch some streamers grimjack on twitch plays it, and woodenpotatoes has a lot of games on it.
---
Who is slashy
---
Watch this guy on twitch if you want learn how to play it. He is good.

Thanx =]

I gg'd yesterday/ right after release with no issues (well besides the gg resetting my adventure). This was added last year iirc
---
In that case - I think you should see a doctor
---
Sounds like raids vs silverwastes to me.
---
You can skip most of w2-2 by using the bird 
---
Same for w1-2 with the worm
---
I mean I know the raft part isn't hard, I just like to hold one button down and go afk during that part. Also that's like the only place where I ever found a stun useful, otherwise killing them takes usually just as long as the animation of that whip - if I don't just run past them anyway. Which I usually do.
---
I didn't know that it's possible to swap back, that's great. Thanks for the info!

I agree tis all irrelevant gibberish for most players. Until you inform rangers they're not useful in wvw groups, or reapers they're not the best in raids.
---
Then suddenly funny gibberish turns into elitism invented by toxic players for gatekeeping. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Sounds like Galactus will come get you.
---
Each run gives a Z coin used for weapon forging.
---
Thanks for the reply. 
---
7-10 will be your stunbreak / mobility / defensive tools on most classes. I really dont recommend clicking those for pvp / wvw. You can rebind these skills.
---
Druid has already been butchered with the Grace of the land change and spirit buffs are the only thing left. 
---
Chrono used to be unique as well but has been murdered with the last 10 balance patches.
---
The problem with support classes is that Anet wont acknowledge that this game needs a boon "spitting" role like old chrono was. Instead they try to split that role into a lot of classes. 
---
Doing this for infusion?
---
Is it worth using one of my lvl 80 boosts on one of my lvl 51 Mesmer? 
---
I have 2 lvl 80's, and the rest of all professions lvls 50-60, except Revenant, which I plan to create once I buy a new character slot, and on which I will use my other lvl 80 booster.  
---
'technically'  the whole raid 1 was a white mantle raid, as Sabetha and her constructs were supporters.  
---
Combine that with the current events, two living world chapters, and the whole mick-mack, 
---
we're talking about a lot of white mantle stuff. So yes, it would definetely not be unprecedented.
---
how you mean? after my adventure on the wrong path I came across a frozen coon and I freed him.
---
Of course!
---
If you /gg in fractals or SAB, it kills yourself allowing you to respawn at a checkpoint. It's perfect for those areas were you get stuck or if you fell and don't want to spend time to jump back. 
---
So is 36k achievement points the max?
---
Play classes to share boons
---
Beginner friendly would be necro and guardian (undying combo). Necro becomes scourges and guardian become firebrand
---
Skill dependent would be ele and thief (squishy buy hardest hitting). Ele becomes tempests and thief becomes might spamming deadeyes
---
This needs to be explained in game or well known because this shit caused me a lot of grief for no reason. I did the same thing as OP and restarted zones over again. It wasn't until w2z3 when I felt so exhasted after I died that I just sat there. Then it suddenly teleported me back to gordon and I thought, "Are you fucking kidding me... all this time because of my impatience the fucking irony".
---
Shoulda been broken for I shat
---
It's not explained because it's not intended behaviour. It's what you get if you just throw 2 systems together
---
You can break out of the plants with 1. Just won't work if you're holding a key, so drop it, break out, then pick it back up.
---
Way too soon... It will always be too soon 
---
Mirage is good for bosses that move/attack quickly; I would not recommend going condi mirage unless you intend to do raids where phases are long.
---
I would recommend a berserker chrono if you want to stay Mesmer, because it will perform well in open world/dungeons/fractals and a good number of raid encounters.  The downside is the rotation for good damage is somewhat complex (see decritize or snowcrows pages for meta fractals/raid builds, metabattle has good options for open world, but not as heavily optimised).
---
As I wrote before if Spirit offensive buffs are gone they could bring Druid healing back to pre-nerf levels and also modify its other offensive capabilities like Spotter/GoE. Druid would still offer great utility for a healer class with longbow pushing, Entangle, reliable CC, Nature Spirit, 5-man Superspeed and so on.
---
I couldn't disagree more on your views about Chrono. Old Chaos Chrono especially in the double Mimic meta was borderline broken. You could have over 90% Resistance uptime on certain bosses. Perma Stability on top of that. The gameplay was not fun and engaging at all.
---
The game doesn't need a single role that spits out all boons. I think the current state is mostly fine. You need classes that can spit out basic boons like Quickness, Alacrity, Prot, Regen, Swiftness, Vigor, Might, Fury, occasional Aegis and that can be covered by the main support classes Chrono/Ren/FB and Druid/Tempest/Herald/Renegade in almost any combination you make out of them. Vigor is perhaps the only boon that is a bit problematic to get right now. You want Stability and Resistance on top of that? Well guess what, you can't have it!
---
Honestly while I don't "not like" the armors ... the fact that you can't apply any dyes to them puts me off a lot. I think they're cool for leveling characters (since it doesn't cost any transmutation charges to apply) if you don't use outfits, but I have a hard time fashionwars-ing them into my characters' looks.

 It is my sincere hope that this clears up any problems you have. If you require more information, please do not hesitate to read this message again, and maybe try paying attention this time. 
---
Oh I see, The reason why I picked Mirage is I love the Axe and fast-paced attacks. If I do go Chrono I might have to use the Great sword right?? which I'm not a fan of on any character it just feels so clunky lol. Sorry if I sound bitchy but I just love fast-paced action and the Axe so far is giving me that excitement :(
---
Some duos that spring to mind:
---
Revenant (Renegade) + Guardian (Firebrand) - Great in raids, fractals and general pve content, also works in wvw with different builds.
---
Guardian (Firebrand) + Necromancer (Scourge) - Great in wvw and pvp
---
Ranger (Druid) + Mesmer (Chronomancer) - Great for fractals and raids, healing/boon combo
---
I probably was in the lobby. Just tested and you can´t there, you get a message that it´s only for fractals and raids.
---
Istan was nerfed? Any info about it?
---
They could give you a solid alternative to old chaos chrono but they can't. 
---
I remember when alacrity was an chrono buff only cause it fitted the specs thematically. Now they dumb it on everything. 
---
The way this is going we will end up getting 5 support classes to cover 5 boons and that's a nightmare when you try to get a group together. 
---
Most "support" roles can easily cover Might Fury swiftness with some occasional vigor / protection/ regen but people don't run them because there is 1 classs that does that and adds more on top it ( offensive buffs with spirits ) while other ones offer unique defensive stats like Soothing mist , strength in numbers , barrier and revive pulls. Why no one complains about them ? Because in this game they are not needed. 
---
Removing the niche buffs from each class is the worse thing it can happen to this game. They already reduced the stat points from spotter / EA / AP and now banners and I have a feeling it will only get worse.
---
&gt; Break bar could be learned in the instance of Claw Island for example
---
that's actually a decent a idea.
---
What happens when your templates share gear? Power Dragonhunter (Righteous Instincts) uses the same gear and a different greatsword compared to Perfect Inscriptions, and the same gear as PI with three diviner trinkets for Power Quickbrand.
---
no. there is no max.
---
That's what holovideos are for.
---
Any number is unacceptable. What is important is the context - when banwave happened anet had balls to claim the banwave was carefully prepared and they do not accept any appeals.
---
Maybe next time anet learns minimum humilty before acting bold.
---
It's entirely down to personal preference. A lot of people recommend not using the booster on your first character in order to learn the basics of the game first, but it sounds like that doesn't apply to you. If you're not enjoying the levelling process and want to jump into level 80 content with your Mesmer, then sure, why not.
---
I wish gw2 was at least half as hype as MCU these days.
---
Thanks for your insights here and i get your POV.  To be clear on my point of view is that I think GW2 could get bigger, earn more revenue, etc.. if they attract more new solo players and this is the problem atm: the story isnt that enjoyable if you do it solo and especially if don't know anything about GW2( like the Zhaitan fight).   
---
i will address your points from my POV so maybe we can get on the same page.   
---
I doesnt mean that the base game is free that it shouldn't get any attention. it is still part of the game and it is what the players first experience. The whole challenge from WP wasn't to show that you can No Skill it but to show the flaws in the game of how easy it can be and how you can take advantage of that. The fact that only his pet finished the story is insane and shouldn't be a thing in an MMORPG like GW2. My question for you is: did you play together throughout the world but everyone did their personal story seperately? or did you join each other story instances? Still very brave of you to choose ele because it is the hardest class to get used to and maybe that was the hard part? idk your experience, im just guessing here :)  
---
A note i want to end on is the whole worrying bit. I don't get why players are nervous about LWS5 following instead of expansion. The first expansion took place after 2 LW seasons and it was the first big expansion. I remember and interview or post ( dont know which one), that one of devs told that expansion would follow like this: big expansion - small expansion - big expansion - small expansion, etc... Or at least i got that feeling because PoF came quick after HoT which took longer because of the features.  So i think it a twisted way to say that no expansions would come in the future because they are a big selling product for Anet as well. It may take a while but it will come when it is done. The content that GW2 gives is a lot imo. Every LW episode we get a fractal/raid wing which is some consistent content right there ( especiall fractals) . And even that we still get some events like april fools or something the race events between LW episodes so i think that is a lot imo. i agree that it runs out quick but maybe they can add a challenge mode for raids like they do in WoW.
---
And even then, IIRC, Firebrand can spit out a lot of boons like old chaos chrono when built for it. Not as much, but still noticeable. 
---
Also - I really don't think nerfing stuff ruins 'unique identity'. They already have their class mechanics, and that's something that Anet's never going to remove... unless you believe that pulls and such are part of Chrono's class identity, that healing and might are part of Druid's class identity. It's actually kind of funny to see people suddenly act as if Druid is in this extremely weak spot whereas a few months ago people seemed to act like Druid was nigh irreplaceable and extremely OP... I don't get people. 10-man might, GoE, and spirits are still very strong and if you need an offensive healer, Druid is still one of the best. It just has some real competition now, which is fine and healthy. Renegade, for example can't do 10-man might, only for its subgroup, so the other subgroup still needs a might source. And if you want spirits that means you might want to bring a Soulbeast. Or, you could get past all of those hurdles by just bringing a Druid, which simplifies things a lot. That lone, that sheer utility and compression of might, spirits, and healing into one, makes Druid very strong, just as Chrono is still strong, but nowhere near as strong as it used to be. 
---
(Watching the meta change finally this patch has been fun - FB/Ren/Chrono being a thing marks the biggest change to the raid meta in over two and almost three years, I think?) 
---
by the time you get all those points you're missing, we'll have more than 3k new points in the game, making the 36k goal available to you. Rejoice, you will not even have to sit there with nothing to do and wait for point to be slowly added to the game, like veterans did (it took like 4 years between the creation of those armor skins, and the first time someone unlocked both, same goes for the backpacks)
---
&gt; That's not going to let people 'play what they enjoy' at all.
---
And neither is what we have now - as I already proved, with numbers. So how is *that* any better? 
---
The only thing that creates a semblance of diversity is not that *all* builds have similar potential, it is that we have multiple builds sharing similar potential **and** similar gameplay difficulty. The lack of proper advantage on harder builds only makes them effectively underpowered, as evidenced by their considerably lower popularity.
---
well that's a new perspective on things
---
thanks

List them for Sellorders, those mats are traded with such a high volume and throughput that you loose on money if you just sell them instant.

Aww, but it missed the part about his medium armor!
---
Honestly if it pulsed protection it would make everyone who plays scrapper a bit happier. Alot of us run the conversion build which relies heavily upon protection converting condis into boons

Tangentially at best.

Hope the new tonic is a reward from the racing adventures, or I would have been hyped up for nothing..
---
Good luck. Meta event wich no good reward. In map nobody cares for. Nobody is looking into LFG. In a times when we have SaB and everyone is there. Yeah a lot of players will join. 
---
I'm so sorry, but before clicking I thought that it was two sets of Butts and legs on the left pic..
---
not gonna happen
---
Kind of bummed out actually. I bought and played GW2 a bunch after release, been feeling like getting back into it because of friend that hyped up the Super Adventure World. Been going through what exactly did I miss throughout the years, and gee, that's a lot of money to spend if I wanted to play everything.   
---
I guess I'm fine with buying the expansions, but then I would still have to buy the Living World too. And make new character to start fresh because of how the things changed since then.  
---
Any tips on how to get back into this?
---
Well, afaik, hope is dieing at last, my friend :)
---
That's the perfect word for it.
---
Us (2019)
---
What chest and skirt is that?
---
Daredevil is a lot more versatile of the two IMO. It has tons of evades, amazing mobility, and better crowd control, while deadeye excels at single target DPS and stealth attacks. I think it will be easier for a beginner to unlock daredevil first and use that to unlock deadeye than the other way around. Once you have both trained, you can swap between them whenever you want out of combat.
---
i don't say that they should stop making an expansion or that they should focus on only on revisiting PS. It is just a pain point in the game that needs some solving.
---
na its coming right after build templets and fractal leaderboards
---
It's not just reward though, I think. It is also not very good event gameplaywise (to put it mildly). I did it twice so far and can't say that I enjoyed it very much.  
---
Several reasons: (1) The brand isn't the most fun area of the game, (2) the fact that the 2nd phase is so heavily dependent on CC is gimmicky and leads to frustration since not all classes have access to the same level of CC skills, not all players know their professions well enough that they can optimize the CC they put out and yet, if one of the groups that have to be organized beforehand fails, the event is over. No reset, like in Tarir. No option that other groups come to the rescue to help struggling groups like in TD (since the timer is far too tight).
---
And finally, if you made it past the 2nd phase the third phase is just a confusing mess, where too much is going on at the same time and the game in addition expects you to watch a tiny icon under the bosses name to figure out whether you have to attack from rage or up close. 
---
IMO the fight is a remarkable mostly in how many questionable game design decisions have been assembled in one event. But your mileage may vary :)
---
They claim that backs can't  be dyed because they are an old design that didn't have dye info and can't be updated. 
---
So let's get rid of the old backs as items, and replace them with a new outfit-like back slot where we can select any back skin and then dye them in the dye panel.  
---
Like when they removed old town clothes as items and added outfits as customizations.  
---
Then the stats missing from the back would be redistributed to the trinkets, and the infusion slots from the back would be moved to the accessories with a new accessory infuse recipe that is half the cost of infusing a back since you'd have to do it twice.
---
Then we'd go talk with an NPC to recover the back that can no longer be equipped as is not basically a salvageable item, and the NPC would also give us a kit with 1 use (BL kit for exotic and lower backs, an ascended kit for ascended backs) so we can recover materials and upgrades from our backs. 
---
Aalvaging ascended backs would also give you the materials needed to infuse an accessory in addition to the usual materials it would give, two if the back was infused and had two slots.
---
And the item salvaged from backs for the Ascended Salvaging achievement would now have a chance to drop form any ascended item since backs would no longer be gear. 
---
I would have gotten the Dwayna set if I could dye the blue parts white.
---
stop q.q
---
It's a joke based on the fact that you can tag reddit posts as a spoiler which will warn people who want to experience the story without spoilers to stay away.
---
"GW2 - 10,000 Lakes" looks like a title.
---
Plus he comes back in Hearts and Minds if only briefly.
---
Is GW2 region locked? The title of it has US in the name, so I'm not sure if I could activate said keys.
---
I actually like how the boomerang works more, because you can stun enemies from farther away.  
---
The only problem is that it fails to hit too many things. They need to fix it, its collision box is too small, so it goes over and under too many things. 
---
We don't know either. If it doesn't have a countdown it could go away with every Tuesday patch. 
---
I think I just don’t really care about comics pertaining to other people’s PC or their “headcanon.” 
---
It wasn’t gw2 specific but the comic posted here the other day (think it was a repost) that was like “I bet that gibberish ruined someone’s day” was fucking hilarious.
---
this sub just kills me because I love gw2 and once invested thousands of hours into it but I dont have a lot of time to play it anymore. I do still miss it like crazy though and try to log on when I can. I come to this sub to get my fix and it’s just ... a new poorly drawn, unfunny comic. I suppose that may be a fault of the game’s current state as well considering where we are in the story release schedule and the layoffs and whatnot.

**Gonad**

A gonad, sex gland, or reproductive gland is a mixed gland that produces the gametes (sex cells) and sex hormones of an organism. In the female of the species the reproductive cells are the egg cells, and in the male the reproductive cells are the sperm. The male gonad, the testicle, produces sperm in the form of spermatozoa. The female gonad, the ovary, produces egg cells.

Can I run a power build on Scourge and have good dps? Currently running minionmancer and working on unlocking Scourge. I want to buy some ascended trinkets, but don't want to buy power for my current build if it won't work for the build I eventually want to run. 
---
I've been thinking about switching to this game more and more. I'm coming from wow. And I played gw2 at launch and got to 80 but quit shortly after. 
---
I barely remember anything from my first play. But is there a place I could go to retell or refresh the story? Can somebody give me a mini breakdown of what I've missed and the major differences between wow/gw2?
---
I kind of don't know where to begin, maybe make a new character and go from there?
---
Pants is aristocrat. Chest Idk 
---
The difference between deadeye and derevevil isn't a focus on power or condition, but a focus on ranged and melee.
---
Deadeye can dish out more damage while being ranged and relies more on stealth, while daredevil gains more benefits from staying up close and personal and relies more on evading. 
---
I am not sure if there's any other official vendor hope someone can help you with that. But do you use VPN? It might affect certain online payment processs
---
Looks like cabalist chest.
---
How would you know? ;)
---
I'm pretty basic actually. Cos my ranger is a DPS soulbeast. The gazelle has an awesome dps skill and the wyvern generally has really good CC. There's this link to a Druid build in which the author describes a few popular pets and their uses, you might wanna read through it: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Healer_(Fractal)
---
When you say hop in do you mean make a new character or continue on my previous one?
---
And by comparing the 2 I guess I mean more what is the drive at the end of leveling? Cause what I typically did in wow was dungeons and gear up for harder dungeons and raiding. I don't know if there is something comparable to that process in gw2. 
---
Again it wasn’t perfect but realistically if one person (using one since I still don’t have an idea of how many people were falsely hit) gets falsely banned for 6 months out of 1600 cheaters then why give yourself the 1599X more extra work. If they allowed appeals we could have seen an even larger wait time than we got because of the actual cheaters. It sucks for those caught, and there needs to be some improvement to the system but it was effective just not perfect.

No one really wanted Fractal leaderboards. Those who did would want it to use the restricted rule set anyway which wouldn’t be enforceable due to bugs, glitches, etc.

---
the jump is a bit tricky, but it is still way faster
---
unless they changed it now. Didn't tried it yet, but back when sab returned it was possible for sure
---
Dungeon? Surely you mean Warclaw skin? Or perhaps a new chair you can sit on? For all your GW2 needs, open the Gem Store!
---
It's a costume.
---
I don't disagree with this assessment, in fact I agree with him, playing p/p deadeye may give you bad habits, but you should absolutely try it.
---
Who is the artist, if I may ask? This is an awesome piece.
---
Aurene looks high af
---
You pretty much automatically get 25 might from going into fire with the Might per Skill trait, which may not seem too great, but Air doesn't offer you too much damage anyways. Weavers damage isn't low even with Water, its just inconsistent.
---
Another big pro Fire has over Air is providing you with sustain at the same time, everytime you go into Fire you're cleansing a Condi due to Sunspot/NourishingAshes combo, everytime you go swap out of fire, you probably cleanse two condis. Transmute Fire is on a 10CD and you can swap out of fire and still have your Fire Aura up just long enough to cast it.
---
Theres alot more that that Fire Aura does too, it can sustain your might uptime if you never reached 25 by casting enough skills in Fire, and everytime you get hit you're giving out burning, which is actually really good.

Since it is game and the bans were temporary it is fine we aren’t talking about permanent ban, life goes on. We will just keep disagreeing on this but 1% of those banned being false is pretty good. That is where I stand on it, if you can give me information that the amount of players banned was more substantial I might start looking at it differently otherwise there is no point in continuing, we have different views on it. 
---
Yeah, this is really annoying, specially in 2-2. You pretty much have to restart the whole thing...
---
Cat ears with glasses.
---
Wait that's one word less than five.
---
Wait did I Haiku?
---
Guys come on don’t downvote this thread z.z this is actually really cool that something people in our community discovered also helped other players in different games. 
---
It is not fine. They acted 100% incompetent with this even though people were raising questions about their detection method. Reality proved anet being wrong but the damage is done.
---
why wouldnt you dodge and blind as a PP DE? blinding powder is a great anti swarm tool (not going to be using PP against a pack of pocket raptors) and you dodge like basically every other class; to avoid big attacks
---
[Uh huh.](https://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/705/640/673.gif)
---
So now that binding dodge jump to one button is allowed, can I do it just on a regular keyboard or is that only for gaming mouse?
---
Why isn't his left eye blue? :I
---
Not that I know of

I never really understood these posts asking for new dungeons or a desire to lure players back to dungeons with new rewards.
---
First off, I feel like any new dungeon released would fundamentally be identical to a fractal, except with a different entrance and non-universal rewards.  All of the mechanical things that make dungeons feel different from fractals (one shot mechanics with barely visible telegraphs, repeating the exact same opening part three times for all three paths, stacking in a corner and power rezzing, etc) would likely not be in any new content released...  They’re more just a relic of an older game designed by different people with greater technological restrictions.  
---
And actually, a lot of the dungeon spirit has been captured in the Living World if you think about it anyways.  Every so often a new lw map comes out—it ties into the story, it has unique boss encounters, some 5-man instances action, it’s own currency, and you farm it for a few months until you have all the new skins and other various rewards.  This is essentially the dungeon experience broken down.
---
As for revamping rewards luring people into dungeons, I have to ask: Is this really what the dungeon community wants?  If the rewards are at all worth it, dungeon LFG would become full of sellers and meta-comp elitist posts.  Like, would you really want to see “LNHB +50ess” groups in your LFG?  Because that would certainly happen.
---
Oof, that was longer than I meant for it to be—sorry. -.-
---
They would most likely provide these within Living Story, telling additional stories of new maps with relation to episode and season plot. Dungeon tokens in this case would be season-wide currency and/or map specific material. 
---
But yeah, everyone knows it's not going to happen.
---
&gt; It wasn’t gw2 specific but the comic posted here the other day (think it was a repost) that was like “I bet that gibberish ruined someone’s day” was fucking hilarious.
---
Interesting how some people have diametrically opposite definitions of "relevant" and "funny".
---
Worst and least fun giveaway ever
---
I'm trying to figure out what's worth doing this SAB. I've gotten everything I wanted in this game mode. Got the two infusions
---
I came here to post this. Well done sir.
---
Didn't they drop the rate for the sunspear weapons? Also, I tried opening them with lvl 80 before and, to my disappointment, I never got anything worth much. Same old greens and blues mostly and level 80 so shitty salvage.
---
lol. the dagger next to it adds so much!
---
True. I wish they kept the double magic find on the bags. It was more motivation to get your magic find up. You'd be able to get ectos from blue bags if it was high enough. 
---
Actually it was but a jest. Since every being in GW is able to use magic and just needs to refine it's skills. Having someone find a chrono tome and try to cast spells for the heck of it doesn't seem like a long shot. (Seems especially feasible since asura don't give a crap about safty measures since they are sure their genius knows no Borders.)
---
What could go wrong with spells that can alter time itself anyway, right?
---
&gt;Things that get you banned, such as botting or cheating tools actually effect the data being passed to the server. They alter data, or replicate data in a specific pattern. 
---
This does not appear to be the case. Plenty of people have been banned because of other software that ArenaNet detected running on their computers regardless of whether or not it even interacted with the GW2 process. Plenty of other people have been banned for software which read data from GW2 but did not affect anything about the data sent to the servers. This is why, for example, certain DPS meters have gotten explicit "approval" from ArenaNet in spite of the fact that all they did was to read data, while others have been condemned by the devs for things like displaying a mob's raw HP total even though this only required reading data not altering it.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65554/policy-macros-and-macro-use  
---
    Here are few common macros that are allowed in the game:
---
    You may bind dodge and jump to a single key.
---
My Inquest is a friendly sort :P It fit him so well lol
---
Thanks for the tips, appreciate all the replies. Someone mentioned you may have a twitch? Link that, I’ll support your content.
---
Just visit your local asura store in Rata Sum!   
---
Also, I do have a commission page and they are open!

Personally I just love the random 16 bit graphic style it has. As for the rewards, it varies each year but I heard you can get mystic coins this year as a prize, that's always a great thing. 
---
I'm feeling so attacked right now
---
&gt;  I asked the support and they replied with we dont know.
---
because that's the answer.
---
no one knows, it's an arbitrary decision that probably hasn't been made yet.
---
Depends on what you want to use the build for. Keep in mind that the build posted uses ascended gear which means if you follow it you'll still be short some crit chance. If youre looking to do some raids/fractals I'd suggest just getting full beserkers and using thief runes in the gear (they help alot with critical chance). That'll get you close to where you need to be with minimal effort, once you're able to afford the right gear and such you'll have a better understanding of what you need.
---
Oh nice, do they have skins as well? 
---
And then I’m hoping this is my final question, but what role does fire weaver play? Is it basically in the spot of a Mesmer or thief where it just roams and decaps / +1s a fight? Or does it fill a different role?
---
eh, give and take. Dungeons had a lot less flavour than some fractals (Urban battleground had a WAY more active and interesting background and design than HotW for example) and Dungeons went with world relevant short stories, while Fractals go with some insight into previous world events. The fall of Amala and her reanimation at the hands of Joko was better than 95% of existing Dungeon storylines, same with the emotional gut punch at the end of Shattered Observatory.
---
I would love to see Dungeon back too just because PvE content that isn't hard but isn't braindead is a severely lacking middle ground right now. Devs being so adamant that its not happening is why the community gets salty about this kind of thread though, we've been given an answer, as saddening as it is.
---
I mean, Fractals themselves are "paths" to the overall Story *Arkk* (lol)
---
What does RCSOM mean? Sorry newb here
---
I think the problem is simply that the promotion ended already.
---
have you actually played Dungeons? There is always at least 1 NPC following you along who babbles non-stop.
---
It's the opposite: there is a crit cap you should aim for, and the primary stat for crit is Precision. 
---
In power builds, your goal should be to hit the crit cap of 100%, but whether you will be able to do that will depend on a number of factors like whether you have group buffs (Spotter from ranger, Banner of Discipline from warrior), food and utilities, and the Fury boon. In fractals, you also have access to potions which increase your stats.
---
When you are completely solo, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to hit crit cap (with a few exceptions, like dragonhunter) because you won't have access to group buffs. Fortunately, stats don't matter hugely in solo content.
---
With respect to gear, most power builds will recommend using just enough Assassin's hear to be able to reach crit cap with Fury, food, and the most common group buffs, because that will theoretically maximize your damage output.
---
Please press F to pay respects to my wallet. 
---
I think unfortunately that promo is no longer running so the code has been invalidated. 
---
1. Fractals are much shorter than dungeons and tell severely truncated stories/don't even tell a story (seriously, what is the Molten fractal's story? We see Braham and Rox saving a couple people who can't even get their dialogue properly timed and then we fight two bosses for... reasons?)
---
2. You're right about a lot of the spirit coming through in the Living World, but I always feel like the LW story tends to be rushed. It's akin to a mix of the Personal Story (hey we have a ritual now!) and the better storytelling they've had in dungeons and other areas. Then you have things like the Elegy "quests" which feel like they would be just as good or better as a dungeon. The Elegy/Requiem sets could have been the armor rewards for completing some dungeon set in a post-Joko Jahai. Also, some of the Living World maps feel like there's an empty spot in them where we're missing something (The Bitter Cold is what comes first to my mind). This is a place where Dungeons could take over.
---
3. I think the dungeon community wants the dungeons primarily fixed/rebuilt so they're less fiddly and using modern mechanics (also a good place to tutorialize break bars!). This is a massive undertaking, but I'm sorry I think that a modern MMO should have a team specifically dedicated to making sure old content doesn't feel so totally disconnected from the current content. Look at structures for a good example. Many in the sub-80 zones do not take condition damage for no good reason.
---
4. Also, you want a good reward for dungeons? Easy. Make a themed backpiece for each dungeon and tie it into a collection similar to Mawdrey or some of the LW achievements. Relatively few assets to add, but gives a big goal for players.
---
I think the only way to farm SAB for the weapon skins is to do normal mode and trib mode
---
No no, these aren't a real thing in the game. I was just trying to be silly :P Although you can get a mini bee-dog at the gem store or as a reward :)
---
I have played both of those builds for a while now, i prefer Daredevil because it is way more fun with the jumps and evades and good cleave, the deadeye is decent but sometimes when there is a lot of mobs he cant hit the marked target resulting to long downtimes because of initiative loss to non marked targets. Furthermore even though deadeye has a long range u have to be close to get the buffs and heals from ur team so it ruins the ranged sniperlike element of his.
---
Warrior is a good class with decent survivability and one on one potential. You should try most classes so you know what you deal with. If you have both expansions then i recommend the spellbreaker.
---
Oh sweet!! I'll definitely give this a go!! Thanks mate :)
---
I don't really mind those as long as it's not a dungeon for a daily. Your CDs keep ticking as the cutscene plays, so it means long CD skills can be used in fights with less worry about needing them later.
---
i decided to ignore all the min max and i'm happier this way
---
btw 70 gold for a complete ascended gear ? u gotta pump those numbers
---
Oh D: I thought it was until 1 April... so I must have got it wrong :c
---
Even steeply discounted, I don't know if I can put too much towards RNG chests since I exhausted my yearly allowance of luck from RNGesus a couple nights ago when Tequatl dropped an Ascended chest for me...
---
I must have misunderstood and thought it was until 1 April  :c
---
I wish they would go back and make all hats like that. I don't care what the hairstyle is as long as my character isn't bald.
---
Great deal, 5 BL keys for all the gold I've earned in the game so far!
---
Scourge can do everything the Reaper does and even better mostly thank to Shade.
---
Your main goal as a Necromancer (in general) is to boon rip, damage is a secondary objective.
---
Thanks to the Shade and some Scourge traits/skills you can achieve a way higher boon corruption than with Reaper especially since fight are not that much melee oriented currently and Reaper is very much a melee spec (even if trains were more melee Scourge would still be better because you count as a shade so it's double corrupt/damage/tagging when you go melee). Shade also give you better AoE crowd control (with F4).
---
On a final note Scourge can also provide better support to the group thanks to occasional barrier (to absorb a bomb) and condi cleanse that a Reaper simply cannot.
---
If you really feel that you do more damage on Reaper than Scourge (with an equivalent number of corrupts) I would recommend that you install ArcDPS (+ configure it for WvW) and try to track how many corrupts and how much damage you do for each non 1-push fight on each spec to see if it's indeed the case and how you compare to other Scourges in the squad. That way you can have a better view of your performance and in which direction you need to take it: maybe your damage is actually fine in both cases but you are a bit low in term of corrupts per fight so it could be better to focus on that instead (random example).
---
Thank you for your work, but i dont think that im gonna do that frustrating path again.. 2.5 hours lost
---
Fix spelling errors? Yes. Reworking any of personal story? No.
---
The juice is not worth the squeeze here.
---
&gt; unhealthy habit. 
---
i did 3,959 hours across all characters and seemed crazy to me.
---
btw well done. if it work for you it's ok . 
---
THIS is the thing that gets me. Everyone talks about dungeons being no different than fractals, but I see no fundamental difference between raids and dungeons. OBVIOUSLY the difficulty is different. But when you look at it, it's basically all just bigger numbers. The bosses have more health, do more damage, or just insta-kill people after an arbitrary timer. It doesn't feel like you're having to do something difficult. This is why I wish the instanced level-80 content was sort of flattened difficulty-wise. So that raids, dungeons, and T4 fractals all were roughly the same level of difficulty (slightly easier than current raids) and giving roughly the same kinds of rewards (slightly better loot than the average T4 Fractal now).
---
I feel you, the last time I saw the game 50% off was in... January(?) when I bought the expansions myself.
---
I'm just going off another post, in which at least 4 other people said the 50% off promotion ended 2 days ago, but the items are available in the gemstore until the 1st. 
---
Then you can probably be fine with something along these lines (if you don't aim for T4 fractals right away) or go for a mixed build between metabattle and SC with a rune that give you more precision.
---
God, Aetherpath is the worst, though. Still need to even go through it once because people don't understand how to run the grubs.
---
This is a quality...shitpost
---
You're so close to realizing that the personal story is a snoozefest because it needs a re-work. So close. So. Close.
---
In fractals you have enough precision due to the potion.
---
0:18 he wipes everything off the table cause he's a cat?
---
Honestly, the existing dungeons and paths should just be rolled into different fractals and removed from the world map.
---
I have both expansion, but 2 friends try to take, then tell me the code was invalid :/ sad\~
---
Thanks for the info! I saw the other post with ppl tal and say 2 days only the promo :/
---
For those who wanna see it, just send me a pm and we can get a little guildhall tour going:)
---
Even in fractals you still had a bit of Assassin before the patch which was not helped by the banner nerf so if you keep Scholar you'd still need a bit Assassin I think, potions "only" give you 15% if you adjust for around 150AR.
---
Any tips/strategies on farming Achievement Points?
---
Welcome, sorry you missed it mate. Dlgamer has both for like 39 and some change I think. And it's an official retailer. 
---
It's really frustrating because the mount was/is cool, but they keep nerfing it so players who really did nothing more than 1v1 PvP can keep farming bags from new players with impunity. At this point, I don't even care anymore. The exploits needed to be fixed, but this mount is feeling more and more like a shitty version of swiftness I can only equip if I'm out of combat and in territory I own. From what I've seen, there's only a handful of exploit spots that would be "fixed" by moving a structure literally one foot away. Or, hell, make the walls taller so they're actual walls and not squat fat bricks.
---
Fine sunny day today, how’s your side of the world?
---
SCAMAZ
---
Dodge jump maybe?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Runecrafter%27s_Salvage-o-Matic
---
For dungeons on Soulbeast I usually play with a mix of Gazelle, Smokescale and Eagle (power bird with more mobility than Gazelle). Then for any condi build it's either Iboga, Lynx or Warthog.
---
For underwater it's Armored fish, Lashtail Devourer (power Devourer with a nice CC, which is way more than any underwater pet give to Soulbeast) and Shark.
---
I only included Soulbeast-related pets as I rarely roam around on Druid or Core Ranger :p
---
You have to 16x if you wanna yellow weapons collection:-P
---
I just don't understand how people get so hyped up over these loot boxes :V
---
If you're going for the uncommon account bounds (Exalted Shoulders + Etherbound Package atm), I can kind of understand wanting to roll for a few but for pretty much everything else you're way better off just grabbing it off the TP. Plus, y'know, the stigma loot boxes have from other games. It's probably just a strong sense of want that doesn't resonate with me... It just seems like a really bad way to spend your coin to get gems or a really bad way to gamble cash.
---
Upvote this you worthless pigs!!
---
As far as I know dodge jump is the only natural movement that can give you a longer distance jump.  Outside of leap skills of course.
---
That's part of the meme, Anet wasted years on a feature no one really wanted, while forgoing the development of actual new fractals.  
---
The sale I was simultaneously looking forward to the most and dreading the most 
---
Will do when I get home from work 
---
And then this reminds me of the esports edit gif
---
Ah good old times
---
I did Serpent's Ire with [GOTD], they have nice organization, also they pinged most of CC skills foe each class (for those who are not aware), and they have TS3 voice channel where commander(s) say what to do.
---
I must say, that even with 1.5 squad for we had hard time doing zealots phase, idk if it was fault of ppl who didn't CC (sadly, there are plenty of them, despite all the info and instructions) or mobs are just way too tuned. Still, it was succesful run.
---
EU server.
---
Yes you can use the Warclaw in PvE. You can only use it's first skill i.e. the dismount attack. It receives all passive Mastiers from PoF. e.g. extra damage, evade when dodging, etc.
---
By the way... remember back when "[everyone played weaver](https://www.gw2raidar.com/global_stats/7/All%20raid%20bosses)"? Well it turns out the popularities back then were very much in the same proportions, only reversed - 46k samples on weaver, 26k holo, 17k dh. So let me get this straight - the same disbalance in what people play is fine when the dominating builds are easy, but bad when they are hard? I'm pretty sure \*that\* is not how balance works.
---
The ascended weapon box is super rare though btw. I've played it countless times and never gotten it :/ I think the drop rate is supposed to be 1% or so, but I don't have a link for that so I could be remembering incorrectly. Still fun though :)
---
Congratulations! This is the real achievement.
---
Personally I would probably be more hyped for this (more than 0), if I didn't have the situation where I opened 30 black lion chests in a row from weekly key runs, and didn't get A SINGLE uncommon. Just straight up 4 items each week, for more than half a year. Not even multiple black lion statuettes, always just 1.
---
Honestly? The addition of statuettes mean that even if I don't get the shiny thing I want I can eventually get it anyway. Coupled with earning statuettes from weekly key runs I can pretty much guaranteed get any uncommon item from these things eventually. That's reasonably worth it to me.
---
My gonads identify as Glintatorrik.
---
Take note, friends - real pros play with all nameplates displayed, always.  For real.
---
Hey guys, I plan on getting minstrel's gear via WvW with my FB but i want to know until i get Minstrels what exotic gear would you recommend ? Cleric looks like a go to but wanted other peoples opinion on this.
---
I'm right there with ya.
---
All the keys that I got as drop/farmed over like 5.5 years playing this game i have not once gotten anything that is worth a damn from opening a black lion chest. At this point I simply cannot understand why people think it is worth at all.
---
At this point I don't even farm keys anymore because it feels like a waste of time since I know I'm gonna get some junk from the box...
---
Did anyone actually want any sort of leaderboard? Such as these http://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/
---
givers
---
Yeah, same on Charr. I made topic on GW2 forum two or three years ago about this issue, but no one cared, and devs too. Maybe because it's not paid skin from gem shop :(
---
Useable, but not usefull
---
If she is revived with no cost and no real merit in the next episode, I agree. THat's DBZ levels of death doesn't matter.
---
If her death is not easily fixed, has lasting effects and leads to a lot of existing story development or permanent suffering of some sort, then I disagree. A death can serve a purpose in a story without being final.
---
I also don't find it very Cliche. "All or nothing, we have to beat them now!" Where the heroes eke out a narrow win over a vastly superior enemy is a vast cliche. This was that cliche flipped where we failed and our champion died instead of winning like she was supposed to.
---
i made mine look like a samurai with 2 swords that look like katana (dragonsblood sword) and a darkspear for staff. #5CC and #2cc are not that bad
---
Searing soon fellow meatbags !. 
---
I don’t think the game is dying in the slightest, but when I used to play with people I remember spending most of our time just chatting and goofing off in LA.
---
When we would do content together it’s stuff we had all ready done a billion times or some collection achievement where we’d go to a random corner and press F. The focus was never really on the content.
---
I played the game for years in good company and they were 75% of the reason why I kept playing. Not so much the game itself. Personally, I’m having a better time hanging out with people in a better game with more content, but plenty of people play GW2 exclusively for the social interaction and ANet seems to be doing fine.
---
Enjoy your lootbox sale.
---
The difference here is that the 90th percentile DHs/Holos back then aren't outperforming the 90th percentile Weavers unlike the 90th Sword Weavers today, and that Weaver back then was really busted. 
---
Balance *should* be done around what classes are ultimately capable of, and the 90th+ percentile hardcore players can show that. Balancing around the 50th percentile is asking for trouble. 
---
Balance should be defined not by how well a class does, not how many people play it. 
---
The vast majority of pugs don't really use the high-end strat of Quickbrand/Alacrity Ren/BS/Soulbeast + 1 DPS for fractals, they use Chronomancers and Druids, but that doesn't mean Chronomancers and Druids are better overall for fractals because they're played more often and that we should buff FB/Ren fractal compositions...
---
I have just seen enough from that subreddit to know it \*does\* look like from there :)
---
Keep at it!  There are big squads that roll in on the evenings (US) to do this.  I see you have some offers here in the comments already.
---
Also, consider bringing a Revenant with Staff - the #5 skill obliterates break bars.
---
Throw in the pile along with build templates, new races, new SAB worlds, multiple difficulty levels, and capes.
---
And it's 39511 now. It's constantly being updated. The number was accurate for the EU at the time of my original post. New achievements were added with the new features of SAB yesterday.
---
Yes I have successfully refunded when sales like this happened in the past, from a purchase made 5 or 6 days prior, so very high chance you'll get some gem back. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with player numbers favouring the "easier" builds. That is actually what you should expect across a player distribution, particularly one where there is the extra reward of the more difficult builds rewarding more damage but encounters can still be done reasonably with "easy" builds. 
---
I'm surprised you are trying to argue this with numbers. When there is a small balance disparity, people appear to play what they want. That this is easier builds is not surprising. Less time is spent practicing them, players may get to grips with them more easily or find the rotations more manageable in raids.
---
All that the numbers you are showing support is my statement that when the balance disparity is too great, the over performing professions get played more *irrespective* of difficulty. This should be quite clear why - if a build is over performing massively then the perception is that people should play that profession, thereby increasing representation. 
---
Ascended chest is ~2% from Teq from my personal experience, and it's daily gated
---
For BLC, the chance of getting uncommon item is ~10%, so it's 5 times as likely you'll win ~~makeover kit~~ big!! 
---
Wow. You have inspired me. So often I run AC with new folks and I try to be a helpful teammate - throwing in a few good and some consumables would be a great help to our newer players. Thanks for your spirit of community.
---
Fucking brilliant!  Thank you for this - you made me smile at work.
---
The other problem with difficulty is that there is no consistency. Depending on the choices you make some instances can be hard while others you can probably afk through and it's not like you decided you were going to take the hard path either since the only way to know which is the hard path is by having done it previously or you did research ahead of time and assuming that was covered by the research material.
---
What's the hype over these?
---
It might be cliche, might not. Depends on the next episode
---
Why you guys getting downvoted
---
Possibly the top 5% of players would've liked to know where they stand? But TBH GW2Efficiency has so many stat-tracking elements anyway that most people I know who are interested in competing for other things just use that.
---
Because the wvw community feels neglected and refuses to believe that alliances will happen 
---
Pocket. 
---
Raptors.
---
I mean it would be so easy to bring dungeons back to life. Add an hard mode. Just throw in in more numbers, healthier bosses, more damage, no need to add complex mechanics. Maybe add something to the lore. And, of course, interesting rewards. Right now jumping into pvp gives you more dungeon rewards than actually playing dungeons. Unique rewards just like raids and maybe add the possibility to grab ascended stuff 
---
I came back after a looong break (had to buy HoT too!) and I'm honestly amazed by how wholesome this community is. It's not only that events force you to cooperate, but people will also go out of their way to help you get to a tricky vista or explain what a glider is. In WoW I would have been told to just read the wiki. I have to say my second favourite part of this game is the human interaction :) 
---
First place is for mind numbing jumping puzzles, of course.
---
Grocery store strategy. I like that term, and it fits. Basically take 25 keys and multiply by the normal price of 1 key which is 125 gems. Then shave off 25 gems per key. Boom, that's the discount. But since the bundle of 25 keys is normally discounted to begin with, it's not as much of a discount as it seems.
---
The story was never great so there is no "again". I say this as someone who has completed it (*checks spreadsheet*) 13 times and partway through the 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18th. Now you might be wondering "why the hell are you doing it so many times then?" and the answer is "gotta check them boxes". :P
---
The PS was never great but it is a passable experience ... unless you run into a bug in the final instance and you have to redo 45 minutes of stuff.
---
It is also a one time experience unless you make multiple characters.
---
That’s why they set up the sms authentication, to figure out that age old question, “do you not have a phone?”
---
You are aware that WoW is dying since about 2004, right? I am not kidding, that is how long players whine that it is dying. So yeah, eventually, for sure. What does it do for you, that 20 years (or whatever number) in the future you can say "told you so"? 
---
I like dungeons a lot but I think many fractals have those virtues as well. Just that by now we're too familiar to them to think of them as special mechanics. Cliffside hammer, siren's reedlf money bag, Aetherblade laser, Deep stone light skill. I may read you wrongly here but I think it's a bit unfair to st Fractals are just DPS check.
---
The advantage of dungeons in my opinion is that it's longer and more thematically coherent so you feel like you're on a quest. Doing fractals seems like a small challenges and sometimes it doesn't kick in thematically before it's over.
---
Totally agree that there should be moreeeee fractals with new mechanics like mount/glide though. Though I guess in a way raids are doing that. 
---
TLDR; fractals have great mechanics, but there should be more with new ones and perhaps chained-fractals to make it more thematically significant
---
Vectoring is the speedrunning term I'm familiar with. Is there another, or are you just being that guy?
---
I mean. Wow. Of course individual people will play what they get better results on if they also enjoy that spec (which normally correlates with a better performance anyway).
---
I really don't understand your grasp on it. There is nothing wrong with people preferring an easier and more reliable build if the more challenging builds *still* give a clear numerical advantage (which they do in the majority of power boss encounters). 
---
W5/6, kind of suck for lfg right now. Even if they release the ring, that’s it, one slot. Whereas 1-4 are for three armor sets. So if you’re a player with limited time you prefer those wings. Makes it tougher to find groups for 5/6. 
---
Agree. I am a dungeon lover but I think I might just be nostalgic. Many fractals have great story and mechanics. I think ppl are just too familiar with them right now to notice
---
Honestly, just 2 tries of this is veeery small sample to make any major conclusions.
---
Yeah I know it's tied to LWS1. My point is that fractal doesn't tell a "story" so much as show something totally out of context. We have ZERO idea who the bosses at the end are. We never learn about them and it just feels useless. I'm sure players who were there for LWS1 are thrilled to see the story there, but it's not a coherent story about the characters in the same way that AC paths are.
---
Hmm, but can spellbreaker break the spell why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch!?
---
This is deeper than they realize.
---
Whoooohooooo! Finally!!
---
Keep in mind raid and fractal builds generally require banners and other buffs with 100% uptime to hit 100% crit and complete rotations. They aren't always the best option for solo or unorganized play.
---
Metabattle is a good place to get ideas for builds, but they generally lag behind on top damage builds for raids and fractals. Really useful for learning the game and the class, finding out different stuff for open world, PvP, and so forth, but if you are looking for raid builds you should check out SnowCrows. They are usually more up to date with what builds will be best for the current patch, and always have a notice at the top telling you if their builds have been updated for the current patch. Metabattle doesn't do this, and while they do update builds, sometimes they can be outdated giving you old information, builds, and gear recommendations.
---
For example, the build you posted in OP is already outdated. SCs current meta build is full berserkers with thief runes for power SB. You might be able to hit 100% crit with exotic gear with this build. If not, precision food will probably get you there.

Fine, I might have a gambling problem. I love opening BL chests. On the other hand, I rarely spend my gems on anything and buy gems like every 4 months...eh. I spent so much money on skins in ftp games, so I don't feel so bad about this. I just feel bad because everyone on reddit here is complaining about these blc keys. I get it, but I like opening loot boxes. Help me.
---
Mostly around 65% i think is the sweet spot with boons and traits it allows to cap at 100.
---
What can I say, he's a cool cat, just likes to chill
---
do normal runs world 1 and 2 daily - each one give you, after completion, big bubble which you can then turn to 250 bubbles each. Not mention you can use TACO or just plain or youtube videos to look where are hidden chests with bubbles too
---
If it's normally 33% off for 25 is this sale actually any better?
---
The main problem i have is that i have no survivability, the reaper shroud really helps me getting through the early push or when i get picked on by a focusparty.
---
my pp wet
---
Dungeons with unique skin armor just like the base game did would be super nice. I am not a fan of this "shove everything into fractals" policy. Most of the added maps are dead so giving them some purposed to make players return from time to time like with dungeons for example would help out gratly imo.
---
How about ID'ing, then picking all the runes and sigils out with a permanent extractor and selling those first, and THEN salvaging?
---
Only time Im willing to buy them is AT LEAST 98-99% discount, and even then I would wonder if it is worth it.
---
Lies! (Belgian)
---
Since your asking for an experienced thief; I can't say I'm a super experienced thief, I've killed maybe 100 raid bosses as a thief, but I've killed 1500+ bosses total over the years.  Dare devil is a much better choice.  More cc, it can boon support at some bosses such as matthias, it actually has cleave damage for xera, and since your only buying one expansion, condi dd can be a passable substitution for condi mirage at the fights that call for it.  Daredevil will be a solid choice for everything except range strat deimos, in which case you can half ass learn the rifle rotation if you care to be good at that boss.  
---
You actually run full Berserker with Thief runes now. In Fractals you can still use Scholar runes and Crit Cap with Infusions &amp; Offensiv Potion, but that is somewhat optional. You can also use Dagger instead of Sword for more sustain but less burst. The Metabattle build is outdated.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/
---
Do full w1 and 2, open chest and do dig spots. Remember you have a Bauble cap in Sab of 250 or 500 with the bag. After this you pick up but don't get the item so exchange 250 for BBs.
---
You can join guilds and do stuff and there are big communities at both EU and NA servers who you can join. It's not only the chat. 
---
I personally for example joined a community. They offer a TS and a weekly schedule of events (around 2-5 events daily) where everybody is welcome to join. I found some events I like, I met some people and started playing other content with them. Some invited me to their raid groups, some ask me for help for whatever they need help at and with some I even play other games. 
---
As you can see, social interactions are zero, only if you choose so. 
---
Idk about others but I run tribute mode after nor Al dailies. If you can do them fast it's quite nice amount of baubles. I believe you get 250 for a zone clear from the end chest. 
---
Can we please just fucking stop with the stupid dungeon bullshit. It ain’t happening. 
---
Dwaynas grace, they said imbagon, and memories just flooded. Even further back IWAY Wars, letting oets die to get absurd stat boosts, almost all the wastrel builds... 
---
You might get hepatitis. 
---
Buff up daily rewards works too 😬
---
Make sure you do your SAB dailies.  
---
I really like grab bags, even though they're usually awful in actuality.  I buy those stupid grab bag bundles of indie games on some of the game reseller sites too and sub to Humble's monthly for the same reason.  It's a relatively low cost addiction so I roll with it.
---
Alright, now hat's dope.
---
I did, and the data you are using is "all bosses" which is an *incredibly* flawed way of looking at things.
---
However, average players doing better with easier builds should be entirely expected and is fine. Players can be "average" for a whole number of issues. That these people succeed more easily with an auto attacking Daredevil over a Weaver shouldn't be surprising and doesn't mean the game is imbalanced. 
---
New class: Red Mage, confirmed. 
---
Gotcha.
---
But what if you bound Space and Dodge to same button (for SAB skips)?
---
From these 1k blue Unids i got 102 greens, if I would extract the minor sigils and runes, I would get around 1g but I wouldnt get any charms/symbols/lucent motes from my salvages anymore. Considering the added opportunity costs (it takes several minutes to extract 100 runes), I wouldnt say its worth it.
---
And it will probably take alot longer for those 100 minors to sell at listing price compared to the few charms and symbols.
---
But 2.5x more players picking up DH/Holo than Weaver does mean exactly that.
---
You can backtrack all the way from the end back to Gourdon.
---
Honest question: why do the doomsayers always end their posts with ":)"
---
It's the same discount that ran the last two March sales as well as as some other sales throughout 2018.
---
Keys have, however, been on even bigger discounts before, like the anniversary sale in August 2018 when a bundle of 25 keys was 1470 gems.
---
Interesting, so far that was my thought as well. Less sure about rares though, runes and sigils usual sell for 5+ silver.
---
Lucent motes however are basically vendor trash, aren't they?
---
Seeing as the guaranteed item is still the dual potion..
---
Reward track farming ;)
---
Instanced repeatable multiplayer content? Sorry, not going to happen. It's going to be the same psuedo-singleplayer Living World as the previous two seasons with one raid and two fractals a year (if we're lucky) sprinkled in. Better get used to it.
---
check the table
---
Just AoE or cleave them down fam
---
I mean, use your own reasoning man. The problem isn't 50th percentile dh/holo is higher than 50th percentile weaver, it's that they are *too much* higher.
---
I just joined this game about two weeks ago and I love it, I only have base game right now but I’m currently level 18 guardian with 6% map completion. The world in the game feels so reactive and alive and the community has made it so fun to play this game. This is my first time playing MMO so I’m really just taking everything in, but posts like these this reddit and just the people I have already met in game has been the most fun I’ve had in a video game. 
---
"radical" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sure my dude, sure...
---
He stated the obvious pretty much.
---
Thanks!
---
Do jumping puzzles whenever they come up as daily options. You get 25 empyreal fragments for a jumping puzzle daily achievement. 
---
Whenever they make a new thing to replace it which can be awhile
---
It doesn't, that's from the gyro itself, but I would argue that the invulnerability from S is worth more than smoke field.
---
Negative. Doesn't seem to be able to pick up items like Keys either. I haven't tried food items or Furniture Coins yet but I have no reason to expect it to snatch those up either.
---
I plan to before SAB is over :)
---
I started playing GW2 about 1½ years ago or so. I *still* feel like I have so much to do! I have a couple of crafting skills left to max, and most of my alts aren't even done with the base story, and then there's dailies and hero points to get and special events and WvW and farming to get the Griffon mount and and and
---
You're not wrong, but the "stupid" part was uncalled for.

&gt;#### “Character Death: More than Just a Plot Device”
---
&gt;Creating compelling non-player characters in video games is tricky enough—but killing them can be even harder. Giving characters a meaningful-enough relationship to the player that their death has impact—without making people feel like it was used as a cheap way to escalate drama—is a tricky line to walk. Join members of ArenaNet’s narrative and design teams to learn about lessons and strategies they’ve used in *Guild Wars 2*.

&gt;Get ready to enter the Mists and battle for glory and rewards! The next PvP League season begins on April 2 and will run through May 27.
---
Even add a buff song for the flute like speed boost or something is better than this useless boomerang.
---
Yea it feels like there's just so much to do!
---
After I ran my weekly key yesterday, I audited my account for keys because I really want that combo before it rotates out. My Asura necro hadn't done any story past 20 and I got to do some PS I've never touched before; it was a pleasant surprise!
---
I beg to differ.  Fungleberries are just popular because of their skrozzle ability buff, but that can quickly be outmaneuvered by any well played Jubilerang or Yundlespoon, provided they carry enough morblespat immunity, which most noobs don't bother with.  I'm with any other decent player in thinking the Jubilerang can pull off top smoshpow if they just learn to use their keyboards and maintain a functioning brain.
---
You can pick up Empyrial Fragments easily from gathering in some of the living world chapters - Ember Bay (S03E02), Draconis Mons (S03E05), or Sandswept Isles (S04E02).  These have the benefit of giving map currency for ascended trinkets as well.
---
Also available as /qq and the classic /surrender, among other aliases. 
---
I don't know what you remapped your keys to, but by default there's absolutely no way anyone is tapping 1 with their pinky when the movement keys are WASD(QE).
---
Are you drunk again blyat?
---
The vendor you get from defeating the mouth of Mordremoth (Or in a certain time, something like that) gives 3 tabs, of which each can have a 50 emperyal fragment bag as an option to purchase. I use to buy them when I was making toxic focusing crystals.
---
Yes. Btw, what I think actually happens that it shows the window with reset button and 30 seconds countdown, and you get respawned after that so window dissappears, but the countdown is still on and ports you back when it reaches 0.
---
Scourge f4 and your firebrands should keep you alive
---
Yeah but it doesn’t work like that because all exp is scaled to your level. The only levels that take shorter time than any others are 1-26 I believe.
---
Great, can't wait to see the full version in full SAB colors! XD
---
Okay one more time, But with /actual/ advice. Might be hard, but I believe in you. 
---
What weapons do you believe would work more effectively in this situation? 
---
Let's set aside the other assumptions you're making for a moment, and focus on that 
---
And us belgians still can’t buy em. 
---
But what if you have a boon that grants you some crit chances? 
---
The boomerang feels like a downgrade to me... I used the whip to stunlock the enemy on the raft so I don't have to deal with 20 ninjas during the raft ride since new ninjas don't spawn if one is on the raft. (atleast not if you do it in singleplayer.) Now it takes too long and gives the ninja a chance to throw a star at you before you can stun him again. :/
---
huh so identifying then salvaging, seems like "more space taker" but oh well, thanks for great research!
---
It's literally the same picture.
---
My ~~PayPal account~~ skills are ready for battle!
---
Just add special action key for get back to the start. Simple as that 
---
No.
---
Movement speed forward: 294 u/s
---
Movement speed forward+left/right: 294 u/s
---
Possibly relevant.
---
Strafing normally out of combat: 180 u/s
---
Strafing using action camera out of combat: 294 u/s

I’m new to the game and I happened upon Teq one time. I just jumped in to the mass of people and started helping (getting downed). 
---
Once we killed it, I looted the chests and got Teq’s hoard. I was level 60 something. I didn’t realize how rare it was. 
---
I’ve been doing it everyday now. It was so cool to me to see the big ass dragon and everyone fighting it. 
---
I ended up picking a pretty cool looking green dagger. Doesn’t have the right stats though. 
---
Is it really 10% for uncommon? 
---
I’ve been playing for almost year and it feels much less than that, do you have a data or anything similar I could check?
---
I've been playing since launch and I still have a lot I want to do.  My only advice is pace yourself, I've seen many people burn out over the years and I think it's much more fun to just take it as it comes.
---
Ahhhh yes, the poop hole loophole.
---
I got it working, I had an old installation from you for sab from years ago, before you did the all in ones. so I removed that, re downloaded and it worked perfectly, thank you :)
---
Upvotes to the left.
---
Hope it comes with balance patch...
---
Icebound chests in Bitterfrost Frontier contain Empyreal Fragments as well and I think every char you have can open all of them at least once a day (Maybe even after every storm event? Not sure if I remember that correctly).
---
If there is a limit I've never reached it, and I have a lot of alts. 
---
Those little fuckers I swear are the most brutal enemies in the game.
---
i mostly use those glasses on a norn and i never had that problem.
---
but yeah, it sucks.
---
The core game did not prepare me for how crazy difficult the post-game content is. Just wish the bosses in story instances would reset so i could actually learn the boss instead of just wearing it down to win.

https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/74499/how-to-make-object-pasted-into-image-look-natural
---
Here's a good start, someone already compiled some videos on how to deal with this problem
---
As a new player, I can't stress enough how nice every vet has been with me, it's kinda overwhelming. Seriously, it's a joy to play this game when you have such a nice community.
---
Thanks so much! You rock.
---
I would say the characters' "levels" (blacks and whites) are not matching with the GW2 logo (being slightly paler).  
---
Your Mesmer (which I assume is a Sylvari) at this proportion is the same height as your Necro (Charr).  
---
For a background, maybe adding and actually "Path" style screenshot.
---
Guardian: "Take cover behind my shield!"
---
Everyone else: "lolno"
---
so its a fair season for everybody?
---
lul
---
Super valuable input. Thanks!
---
Thanks to all of you, coming from a returning player. I’ve honestly been overwhelmed by the overall attitude and help of this community. It’s been special going away from the toxicity of WoW to this. Already lvl 54 mastery and almost 100% done with all PoF maps! It’s been quite the enjoyable ride and you guys are a big part of it. I had a lot of questions before returning to the game and they were all answered with perfection. Catching up is a big mountain but with this community, everything seems possible. So thank you to all the vets for the tips and help, and thank you to all the new and returning players who are sharing their new experiences and are helping vets return to the source on all the things that make this game amazing. 
---
Love y’all 
---
x'D That's definitely one of the things I'm dissatisfied with. Even if I layer her behind the warrior it looks out of place. Some other people mentioned working on lighting and contrast to try to address depth and thus, this.  
---
Hope I manage to make it better!
---
You can also use perspective and scale them according to their location. Close vs far away.
---
Hey, the sylvari, norn, char, and asuran interactions pretty swell to ya know. 
---
Lol
---
How did you do the archivement on HoT part 2, where you have to do the test while being a bunny and not revive anyone? That useless fk is my last one 
---
You can always add shadow or another texture by their feet to simulate the ground. It's a trick used a lot in older games. Think of how combat in FF7 and FF8 looked when they are being blasted into battle and the background is solid.
---
Not everyone has an infinite continue coin.
---
That makes sense now that I see it in action. Storm Wizard's windup attack is a long enough window for this to work compared to some of the other enemies I tried stunlocking with it (like polar bears for example).
---
I just checked a random video on youtube. This guy opened 500 chests, you can see the result [here](https://youtu.be/AvCzM1yZRvs?t=1723). (He bought 13 golden keys with his statue and kept opening those so those don't count)
---
- 9 fused skins
---
- 2 glyphs
---
- 2 home instance nodes
---
- 22 cavalier skins
---
- 8 makeover kits
---
- 5 black lion tickets
---
So that's 13/500 rare drop &amp; 48/500 uncommon/above drop
---
(may have missed any account bound skin or 25 statuettes)
---
TIL storm wizard can be stunned. Never even thought to give that a try.  Thank you for that.
---
&gt;enjoying a surprise
---
It's not "enjoying the 'surprise'" that entices people with gambling tendencies.  It's not like christmas either, unless you can somehow spend $ on christmas to generate more random gifts. He isnt saying that everyone who buys into lootboxes is a gambling addict either.
---
The people that keep buying boxes because "I might get what I want in the very next box" are the ones he's referring to.
---
I mean this is a more accurate way of making sure you don’t skip or your eyes follow for the camera tbh
---
You can actually cheese it by luring the dogs back to spawn and then respawn everytime you die (the dog will stay in spawn for a short while and not regain health) allowing you to kill the Alpha dog in the end. 
---
It took like 30 minutes, but it's worth it. 
---
Oh I know, but tell that to poor ol' pre-Jungle me who's about to inspect "one" of them because "It looks cute enough, what's the worst that could happen?"
---
Rotationally as in, attunements or rotations as to where you want to be, I think personally its a really good 1v1er, I talked to Koto and Phantaram and they like it in the teamfights more I believe. It's good no matter where it is is probably a fair statement.
---
In terms of attunement swaps I think it plays really similiarly to Lightning Rod Weaver, its really important to cast just about every dual skill you can to mantain high Vigor and Barrier uptime, since you can't resustain too well besides blasting your water fields.
---
Kinda hard to really write it out, sorry.
---
W1Z1 makes me sad spent a while yesterday doing it to get sub 1.40 to find out a cheater has it at 9 sec

I botched the jumping up the ice ramp on the recording, so the time could be improved upon easily.
