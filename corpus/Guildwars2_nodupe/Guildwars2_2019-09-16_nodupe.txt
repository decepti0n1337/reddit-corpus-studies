Nah, when they are in special. Some ppl(including me) buy some accounts for the login rewards.
---
---
---
Lol dude. You can duo the vast majority of paths considering today's power creep and you're complaining about dungeons taking too long? Have you tried doing them recently at all?
---
Most people don't do that, as it can result in all the accounts being actioned. You should open up a support ticket with the "Report a Player" reason. Be sure to include the account names of all blocked accounts that you believe to be the same person.
---

---
In general, though, multiple accounts are not uncommon, so that one can reap multiple login rewards per day, amongst other things.

I don't blame them a rich person does not get rich by giving away their strategies.

Thanks

The server stability issues are even bleeding over into large scale PvE now which is a huge disincentive to play the game if I can‚Äôt even play it properly if too many people are around. It‚Äôs a major issue that needs to get fixed. No if, ands, or buts about it 
---
And Gw2 isn‚Äôt really F2P. Its core is F2P with restrictions including no access to expansions (I.e. most of the important content).  The game is B2P by design and should be treated that way since that‚Äôs what it is. 
---
But really, this is a top tier AAA level MMO in the top 5 of all MMOs generally and you‚Äôre trying to cut them slack on server issues because it‚Äôs ‚Äúf2p?‚Äù  Come On now
---
Some people have more fun using certain weapons, regardless if it‚Äôs meta or not. Staves are cool.
---
She's not trying to sell you weird mystery bog stew is she?
---
When bots are around, you will rather lose games than win. They are useless. Also most of bots are masters of decap/capping so they just run around the map and do it. Your bot caps it, leaves and their bot instantly decaps. But your bot won't ever turn back to defend and runs rather to next node to get killed 1vs3. 
---
Also, bot games do give absolute minimum of mmr, compared to games with people (even like 1/3). So you might have similar winrate as usual around or above 50%, but you will bleed rating faster than losing in legendary tier.
---
Just try it during nights :)

&gt; Dont touch the silver one 
---
People keep saying this but not really saying why. What is the difference between the two?
---
&gt;  I would also put energy into the red mastery points (base game tyria maps) for autolooting. 
---
My memory is kind of failing me here but I am pretty sure mastery points were not even a part of the game when I last played, seems like a pretty neat addition though
---
[removed]
---
This is why I stopped using SoI while leveling back in the day. Swiftness was nice but my character constantly shouting BOOSTO got aggravating after a while.
---
When it comes to survival and damage, which of those two would you say is better? :o
---
Did you have leftover boss Tokens from the last event? They converted to those weirdly
---
They make the money by more people getting involved in what they are already doing.  It‚Äôs basically a recruitment effort.
---
The system they work with basically thrives on avoiding the TP tax until liquidation is necessary so everyone involved gets that benefit until they go to sell the assets.  (I only got 30% in and need to finish the vid later cause sleep, but the gist so far makes sense)
---
200k wallet gold cap, have to hold the gold somewhere else liquid in assets.
---
i have enough data to reasonably assume that most people do not have that many shards. i cannot conclusively prove it without data from anet but i can come as close to it as possible without that data. continuously responding to me does not change the fact that you are wrong. sad.
---
I guess it's safe to say that the Titan's Throat is deep.. :v)
---
dyeable weapons and backpacks.
---
Ok.
---
At some point I would think: I have so much gold and no use for it, why go on?
---
Queensdale Griffon Master course when?
---
TBH 2nd option sounds more like the foundation of a reasonably fun encounter in a fractal of its own.
---
Easy: Ritualist Outfit.
---
I used to log in just to play with the griffon and then log out. Worth every copper.
---
Hanging around and listening to the post-event dialog is always a good reason to not zerg your way through the game. 
---
&gt;What? I am norn! Ale-goggles sharpen our vision! And ale-fists hit hard.
---
I'm guessing it's rich people not wanting to have any secrets come out. This almost always happens with any gold making threads.
---
Other than the game itself, make sure you have around 30-40gb left for swap files.
---
I‚Äôm sitting here, a day 1 player, and cant for the life of me see myself getting the money / mats crafting a legendary- and sitting at a 117 gold, seeing guys with 20k+ is mindblowing
---
With reapers damage, about what percent comes from being in shroud vs being out of shroud?
---
I got a second account many years ago, who knows if it ever paid itself off with mystic coins or not.
---
When does the Ice Brood Saga patch start?
---
I know its 17th Sept, but time please?
---
You have to unlock the recipes through the discovery panel.
---
I like 2 the best tbh
---
Is good game.
---
I don't think there's a specific announced time. However, Living Story patches typically go public near the start of Anet's workday, between 9 and 11am Pacific Time, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Wait, there are old people in this game?
---
Most "old people" NPCS look just as young as everyone else with white/gray hair.
---
read mails next time, and dont cry on reddit if you are just stupid
---
I'm so kittening happy they changed the design, it's a beautiful and unique race across MMOs and it would have been an elf cop-out otherwise. I mean, we have the standard big 5 reimagined - humans, elves, orcs, dwarves and goblins, but their take in this game feels totally refreshing and unique
---
Silver-fed salvage-o-magic costs you in-game money to use (so does copperfed but the amount is trivial - not so trivial on silverfed) in exchange for slightly higher salvage quality, BUT you can get the same salvage quality (and many-use QoL) with Mystic Salvage Kits, made in the Mystic Forge with 3 cheap merchant salvage kits and the Mystic Forge Stones the game dumps on you from various sources. These Mystic kits have 250 uses instead of 25. Use a copperfed on Masterwork and lower, mystic on rares and any exotics you don't want to sell, use Deposit Materials from your inventory cog, and suddenly merchants are just for dumping grey junk. 
---
Ultimate gemstore quality of life trinity if you want to play substantially on more than 1 toon: copper-fed salvage-o-matic, unbreakable gathering tools, and 4 shared inventory slots. Keep regular orichalcum gathering tools equipped on all your toons, then equip unbreakables (and unequip when logging to a different toon) by double-clicking them.
---
The Terminator?  Skynet?  Voltron?  NO.  We won't go extinct when we make an actual AI because we're going to go extinct when make it just smart enough to turn on the majority of people and stick in into something that looks like a porn star.  
---
Who will be able to afford these?  The rich, the connected, the intelligent and ANYONE who has something that others would file suit against just to try and take it away.  Who will still be actually making babies?  [Oh, you already know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXSz0bA9CiE).
---
Go wiki and get ingredients and Discover the recipe, as already stated.
---
Huge waste to power all that and miss all the extra stuff. Each of the 5 racial cooking lines gives 10 cooking levels. In addition... Sylvari gives a food salvage kit, an extra garden plot and the ability to farm rare herbs. Charr gives the ability to collect rare meat from animals too.
---
Nope. Because paid Elite Specs are the recipe for a P2W game.
---
If they didn‚Äôt do it for HoT and PoF they won‚Äôt do it for future ones.
---
Also, nope.
---
Yep it's different when elite specs are part of an expansion, because people expect to pay for MMO expansions. At least reasonable people do.
---
I would pay for it. People are don‚Äôt want to are all for the ‚Äúfree to pay‚Äù don‚Äôt want to support the game pay for in game content gg. So yes I would pay for it 110%
---
Well, after going through the full two hours they aren't giving away anything. They are saying what they are doing and how the small guy can participate and profit but they are very clear that they need those "small guys" because otherwise they cannot profit any further (because their buisness is limited by things that can only be obtained by playing the game). Ppl are only sceptical because they think their intention is melicious. But what they really want is covering new ground because they have hit a wall within their supply chain. That is common practice in many other areas of life and the foundation of most buisnesses till today. For them it is - simply speaking - a promotional video for getting new suplliers. Especially because the good they are asking for is "worthless" in the minds of a large portion of the playerbase (see wp's reaction).
---
Haha üòÇ they are so disconnected from their players at times...
---
Using websites like gw2efficiency and the wiki with your API plugged in make it easy to see your progress on a legendary your going for. It shows you what is required, what you have, and how much each component costs. 
---
Highly recommend both websites, in general.
---
Pls watch the video. They are not even trying to deny that. But they also point out that they would profit of the normal behaviour of the average player anyways but it would take them more effort and more external factors they cannot influence at all. Therefore they are offering a way to learn to make gold for those that are willing to listen through being part of supply chain while their main goal is not liquid gold but wealth (the McDonalds analogy was a little bit out of the blue but is quite fitting). What they are doing is not promissing quick return without many thoughts in the long run but a buisness opportunity with growth to your own capabilities. It is up to any individual if they want to have something like that in their gaming experience.
---
Yep, sat through it as well. They aren't really giving away their "secrets." The everyday player tips they give are what most people already know - don't sell to buy orders and instead list your items, your spirit shards have value, etc.
---
Most of this was focused around materials, the worth of xp/spirit shards and how to convert T5 to T6.
---
They're basically telling people that spirit shards have value and that they pay people 500g/wk to use their spirit shards to convert T5 materials into T6, since the vast majority of people have hundreds or thousands of spirit shards just sitting on their account not being used. 
---
  
---
It definitely seems more like they've used one of the most prominent GW2 content creators to reach an enormous casual audience that might have oodles of spirit shards just sitting there so that they can profit off of it. Granted, they're being transparent and saying that there IS more value in your spirit shards if you do something with them yourself, but they realize most people don't want to bother with that and want fast cash. Which is where people like them step in and profit.
---
Ummm, ok? Thanks for info, I guess?
---
Oh my god who the hell cares?
---
Exactly. Put whatever shinies and new skins and QOL behind a paywall you want, but don't make people shell out extra for gameplay.

Most raid bosses get killed within a day or two of their patch launching.  It took a little bit longer when raids as a whole were brand new because, before then, healers were largely unnecessary in the game and tanking didn't exist as a concept, but now people have honed their techniques.  It's just a matter of learning the gimmicks for each boss and practicing them.
---
It will take some preparation for a raid.  Your level 80 boost character will need to get proper equipment.  Exotic tier will be fine, but the stats you start with on your boosted character's gear will be very poor.  You'll need to find or buy gear with the proper stats for your chosen class/spec.  Past that, it's just learning how to play (a boosted 80 might be the wrong way to learn how to play, as GW2 plays very differently than World of Warcraft).
---
There are metas to follow, but if you're playing with a group of friends you should be able to get away without doing so, though it might potentially reduce your effectiveness.  Joining randoms in raids without a 'meta' build or kill proof for your raid boss might lead you to be kicked.  Outside of raids, and high-end fractals, you can play whatever you want.
---
(Not sure this is how downvotes are supposed to work..)

So to recap: you, that only had to keep track of one item in your one account, couldn't do it. And you're asking ANet to do it for every single Legendary ever made by any account in the game? Do you even have any clue how much effort that would take, how much it would cost in servers and processing to keep track of everything? And this all assuming that Legendaries do have some kind of special identifier that allows ANet to easily tell them apart from all the other items.
---
And just to clarify, because /u/RSBloodDiamond explained it to you, but you either refused to read it or didn't understand: ANet is not saying they won't give your item back because they can't tell if you had it or not. They won't give you your item back because they can't tell what happened to it. Did you sell it? Did you destroy it? Did you salvage it?
---
Technically yes, and technically, I think it would be fair and that anyone who refuses is just spoiled, but in a wider view, I don't believe it would be a good way to monetize the game because it would further splinter the balance between players who did and did not want to spend money specifically to unlock a given spec. I feel that they are better added bundled in with some other purchase.
---
You could potentially have taken a sunrise from another player, use your acc bound twilight to create a not bound eternity, and sold that, keeping the twilight skin
---
Not saying you actually did that, just giving a reason why the support isn't able to help there
---
Before you comment in this thread make sure you really did watch the video. What inside isnt exactly related to Trading Post money making so nothing like Flipping, Crafting or Investing/Speculating. 
---
What you will find there instead is a community effort to escape trading post tax (that really does work) and a good explanation on why farming things other than SW is important. A take on the true value of in-game experince you are getting by normally playing the game and the product of that aka Spirit Shards.
---
Overall this is a nice take on what you can do in this game to earn gold and if you really like playing Gw2 I would advise you to watch it since it will probably help you out in gold earnings mostly because this one isnt rocket science compared to others.
---
&gt; I understand that, I am saying the fact that they do not track the hardest weapons to get in the game is the problem.
---
the problem is that you didnt take good care of an item that took months for you to acquire.
---
The game isn't dying.  People want an expansion, there isn't an expansion announced currently, so some people are disgruntled and vocal about it.  I'd expect an expansion after Season Five, but they're not going to announce that until it's confirmed/ready.
---
Verdant Brink is a good place to farm stat-select gear.  If you're looking for a map to reach T4, check LFG just before the start of the night meta (Even:45 server time), don't come in towards the end.  People have to work together over the whole 45 minute night-time to get to T4 for a chest piece.  It is possible to get the chest piece as a random drop from night bosses, too.  I've got a character camping the Matriarch perch, and I've got three chest boxes on him saved up over killing Matriarch probably a couple of hundred times.  Not a great drop rate, but it's still potentially an option for you.
---
If VB continues to not work for you, you can look elsewhere.  There will be a Corsair tunic available as an achievement reward from one of the LS4 chapters, so you can use that.  Warbeast armour is stat-selectable now too, so you can buy the recipe for that off of the Trading Post and then craft it.
---
I mean OP did ask for a refund right away and since I have no idea when they bought the expansion, I thought maybe they are a returning player and could at least have that going for them.
---
i hope by media outlets you didnt mean a reddit post that will be removed soon
---
I mean based off that attitude I wouldn't help you either.
---
Granny about to cut a bitch
---
And people have their poker nights or whatever.  Part of the difference is that the odds are realistic and the numbers tend to be low.  It's not like a lottery jackpot or winning big at slots where you're more likely to get struck by lightning three times and predatory mechanics are used to keep you losing.  It's also a more personal level where my whole "therapy and material conditions" speech from above comes into play when somebody has a problem.
---
We already do, so yes?
---
Dhuum in W5 took the longest for the first clear.  I think it was at least one day.  Challenge Mode took a little while longer.  If you boost to level 80, you will still likely need to [acquire](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Equipment_acquisition_by_stats) an exotic set of berserker equipment to be considered prepared.  Ascended gear is even better, and there are other gear sets useful for different roles, but all that would take longer.  Depending on your methods, this could easily take several days.  This will prepare you for the DPS role in raids.  There is a meta that is followed quite regularly in pugs.  You're either pumping out support with boons or heals, or you're doing damage.  You could easily be dragged through several raid bosses without experience, but there is certainly a depth to understanding each encounter, and some of them can definitely wipe a group with one player not knowing what they are doing.  I have no experience with WoW but the consensus is that nothing currently in game has checks as stringent as Mythic raids.
---
Yes, very good, and now that you can get both for $30 it's an insane amount of content for the price.
---
Where is this?!
---
Oh good, someone managed to come up with an appropriate pun to summarize my feelings on this.
---
Final boss fight of S5 confirmed.
---
This is definitely one you can just have as background noise whilst you are playing or something
---
So, 2.5 flocks of dancing pygmy moas equals Twilight
---
I wish the others were the same tbh. Feels much more interesting.
---
I want laws to get rid of the companies and departments that facilitate gambling, not impose unjust hardship on individuals.  The last thing we need is another excuse for cops to abuse people.
---
&gt; Also Necro longbow wtf???
---
I mean we have mesmers with greatswords, elementalists with daggers and swords and guardians with longbows. 
---
GW2 never really bound classes to their traditional weapons.
---
how do you actually play holo
---
I just want the option of turning the Sylvari Tier 3 Cultural Armor all glowy like that. L
---
Anet, please.
---
So please clarify.  
---
Me and 4 friends want to play poker at my place Friday night.  Buy in is 100$.  Do you want that to be illegal?
---
I feel you. I only care because of HoT masteries. You need so many Mastery points to max them and many points are locked up in LW. I hope Icebrood Saga uses Central Tyria for masteries tbh and that any new masteries are useful outside of the new content.
---
Same tribe for sure
---
Norn tattoo and white eyes!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Amen, I play this character a lot on WvW and I go with GS/staff as well
---
This reminds me when I listed my Eternity great-sword around X-mas time last year. It got buried by 30 other listings within a few days and I was pretty bummed, as I was hoping for a quick sale thinking a lot more people were buying during the holidays. Then like magic, I think 50 or more disappeared off the trading post. I can't imagine that is the best way to make gold by using the buy instantly option. But it probably inflated the price, and cut down the supply for the true trading post barons.
---
Still waiting for holo nerfs..
---
To be fair...
---
1.7 million gold = He doesn't have to give a shit about the opinions of us or me or you.
---
Why is Druid so bad? It's my first Elite that I've unlocked and I was pretty excited about it...
---
&gt;Is it worthwhile for a newer player to pick up the expansions?  
---
It removes social and inventory restrictions, gives you access to the revenant class, and unlocks the full 5 starting character slots. I say yes just to get rid of limitations, especially if you're enjoying the game.
---
&gt;  but I'm just wondering if there's a better class or weapon combo for this? Ideally someone who's sort of a spell caster looking person, too.
---
Not really, thief shortbow is one of the most mobile weapons in the game, if not the most mobile. Mesmer has some blinks but they aren't as convenient, and elementalist has some dashes with dagger skills but also not as convenient.
---
Go and play other classes and find out what their skills do seems like a good start. If you can play it you know how to play against it.
---
Great work! As a fellow BR, I see many players struggling because of the language barrier. Hope this helps many of them!
---
You‚Äôre not being that guy, fuck that mount.. Fuck the time it takes to get it. I‚Äôm in a bottomless pit and existential quandary of loathing and self doubt over this horse shit.
---
&gt; It removes social and inventory restrictions, gives you access to the revenant class, and unlocks the full 5 starting character slots. I say yes just to get rid of limitations, especially if you're enjoying the game. 
---
Well, this really shows how inept I am, haha. Apparently I already own them, then, cause I have access to revenant and 5 slots. What else do the expansions provide then, since clearly I am unaware of it even being here.
---
&gt; Not really, thief shortbow is one of the most mobile weapons in the game, if not the most mobile. Mesmer has some blinks but they aren't as convenient, and elementalist has some dashes with dagger skills but also not as convenient. 
---
Alright. I brought a mesmer up to 20ish but they seemed really high maintenance for someone used to what I'd call an easier game like WoW. I'll have to check out elementalist some time and see if I like them over thief.
---
welcome to the helicopter club!
---
so for scourge you shouldn‚Äôt rush in too close, they are really good at area denial and literally covering areas with crazy condition damage
---
Watch the video. They don't. They gave these advice because they want more traders in the market.
---
More traders = more activities.
---
it's okay. you'll get there eventually; and when you do; the skyscale is there to lift you up out of the pit of loathing.
---
I get that it's a time &amp; resource sink that some people loathe; _but_ you do not _need_ this mount for any in-game content where it is not provided to you (dragonfall).
---
so please don't get burnt out on this game just because you don't have this mount yet. it's _not that important.
---
&gt; but if ANet asks you to throw a few bucks into an elite spec, it can't be argued that they haven't earned your money for it
---
......are you really trying to defend something like paid elite specs because "they earned it"?
---
I think i finally found the king of Anet's white knights.
---
That's takes so long to get
---
I am aware that is the best method, but I'm f2p so that's not happening for a while
---
Alright do I just focus everyone else?
---
&gt; ......are you really trying to defend something like paid elite specs because "they earned it"?
---
Are you saying that they have not produced enough free content for this game that they could ask you to pay a few bucks more at this point?
---
I'll be around this evening and add you! Looking forward to chat with you and your guild!
---
What are the armor names?
---
shards are rare, gw2 playerbase is largely casual, they only have one use. that data. the only one pretending is you. i'm not a propagandist nor am i phony, i know i'm correct on this matter and i will keep replying as long as you do. if you don't like people hurting your ego, don't make false statements on the internet
---
i love how HARDCORE pvp players still dont get message when AT are not aviable for 4 MONTHS :D
---
Ah I dont use that d912 thing. I have arcdos chainloading my hook
---
Hmm.. to me, the older the design in this case, the more I like it. She looks more like an elf than a plant creature, but then again I guess I don't like the aesthetics of the more plant-like design as much personally. Quite interesting to see how it evolved, in any case.
---
Just work for sabetha instead, earns you 100 gold for each head, get choppin' !
---
Hell no!
---
Instead IMO it would be awesome to unlock them like legendary weapons but somehow have the journey/achievements available only based on the profession you are currently playing.
---
That doesn't change the fact that they were bad ideas.
---
IMO holo can sit in the forge for far too long.
---
Yeah, the collection was way too long to be interesting.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It was made to be long, not to be fun, and it definitely shows.
---
After the very first steps I had to take a break from the game for a while, because it was feeling too much of a chore
---
If it was real money yes.
---
That probably seems better than my method which was to farm silver wastes so much that the game treated me as a bot after my 12h of consecutive farming of the exact same circular route x)
---
You are never really done.
---
This is a human babushka.
---
You don't even have to complete the story mission, only to the point were the raptor unlock pops up, but before you wait for a ticket, tell your wife to play the mission again, this will be way faster.
---
Numpad. Easily and fast accesable with right hand.
---
1 raptor
---
2 springer
---
3 skimmer
---
4 jackal
---
5 griffon
---
6 beetle
---
7 warclaw
---
8 skyscale
---
Shsh, Mina's still working on her gun license
---
Are you telling me the it is easier to reach all the poi faster with gripphon than with skyscale? I did map completion for hot multiple times and it is not . But I have no time to spend trying to make you change you mind . I just wish I could have my 250 gold for gripphon back
---
 Tx God I did not unlock for my 2nd account
---
Staff is super useful for open world minion masters as the ranged option that is also great at tagging mobs. Sometimes you just want to step back and be a bit less of a useful reaper but also less of a dead one.
---
Yeah she didn't get it when she was supposed to. I'll report it so they know, and we'll reply it when we can.
---
But has/will OP join the Jet club?
---
I think you have to purchase the raptor from the heart vendor once the heart is complete inside of the instances. Maybe your wife didn't talk to the NPC to buy her raptor? It should be simple enough to run through the instance up to the part where you do the heart and just unlock it that way. If she has progress to move on already you can just leave after unlocking the raptor.
---
Seven years, soloed dungeon before but years ago, tried again yesterday for the challenge and didn't manage to get in. I have the story done too. It's probably a bug or something so I sent a ticket
---
It's too late... Players know that, and Anet too. No Alliances or other update can bring to mode back to a healthy state.
---
Even if they started merging servers, people are still leaving with no new blood staying in the game mode long enough to replace them.
---
The asura golem comes from golemancer rune. This is a good choice over scholar because i don‚Äôt hit 100% crit. As far i know, i would not take scholar with boonthief.
---
Certainly didn't miss them. But as long as the patch come, holos are pretty good up there right now. That AOE CC nerf on forge 5 was definitely needed, its 5 people launch with 600 radius. I dunno I would have said their easy access and maintaining quickness is a big problem as well, because even with 1 or two skill nerfs the base damage remains high and with quickness they do apply a lot of pressure.
---
Did I see you in DR last night, on EU?
---
Because people like roleplaying and fetch quests.
---
&gt;why would someone do that?
---
Daily rewards!
---
But you can justify rampage uptime? Headbutt is a nice opener, putting you right on full adrenaline when a fight starts, stunning you foe without swapping away from you dmgset and you can chainkill by targeting the next mob with  decapitate once the current one died (or take gs for in combat mobility and have huge cleave which is also great in open world).
---
Without hb you'd need to take "to the limit" or activate the sigil.
---
Well I can outrun a centaur, so ha!
---
yes same money, with less broken mouse buttons
---
You can be that guy if we allow stuff like "First legendary after 6 years of playing (then it's like a Gen 1 legendary)" or something like this cause that shit was way more annoying/more work to do then any Gen 1 legendary.

Honestly the first three collections are the biggest turn off i have ever experienced. After the second time i had to mindlessly walk around this dragon i was Like: fuck this. Not worth a second griffon and quit the game for some days because i was so let down. By now i reached the infusing part which is super fun and brought Up a lot of memories and also uses this new markers. 
---
But really fuck arenanet for sending me 5 times around this Island to the same 15 spots.
---
Honestly I'm surprised that's not how it functions already. If a skill self-ccs then i feel like that should simply ignore stab.
---
What secrets
---
That they havent earned their money by destroying the last bit of semi solid trust most people have? And after elite specs, whats the next gemstore item... Gen3 of legendary weapons? I mean, they earned my money for it, no? Infusions? Sure. Lets kill this game and turn its corpse into a quickly decaying cash to to show exactly what is wrong with the gaming industry these days. Oh loOk, a dev ModelLed a pilE of sHit, those 10 minUTes of devellopmeNT have to be tuRNed into ProfIt
---
What secrets?
---
The whole video is basically just about spirit shards and making legendaries, which isn't anything new or special.
---
Haha oh snap
---
I hang around 25 mostly, blowing it on little increments usually. I got two legendary, though.
---
Working on a third, but it's getting a bit hard now.
---
New post, sorry! Goofed up with the Imgur album.
---
Part 2 of the War Eternal arc!
---
I didnt' know what to expect at all from the finale  and what we got absolutely blew me away. Like...wow

OP could have used his account bound twilight 2 years ago to make Eternity with an unbound Sunrise from a friend.
---
Friend gets the new Eternity and OP unlocks the Sunrise Skin.
---
Friend sells Eternity, buys another Sunrise for himself and splits the 1000g profit between him and OP.
---
OP demands a new Legendary Twilight from CS despite having earned an extra 500g and getting the Sunrise Skin unlocked as well.
---
You: CS fucked up here.
---
I love it
---
EYYY! Mr. Moustache, Happy flexing and thanks!
---
&gt;

&gt; 
---
&gt; After watching the video and comparing it to my own experience and what I've heard other people observe, I've come to conclude what you said is an overly-common tragic poor-person's excuse.
---
People talking about "overly-common tragic poor-person's excuse" are typically people trying to work an angle on tragic poor-people.
---
holy shit lmao
---
&gt; Sadly, a poor-person's mentality is something you get taught growing up. 
---
I'm laughing so hard right now. Incredible.
---
Hang in there! Its such a pressure once you have it‚ùÑÔ∏è
---
Yes that would be me probably! Her name is Nnroi
---
I'm working towards mine this week too. Currently grinding out all those map currencies because I started with about 5 of each... this stupid dragon is a huge pain in my ass
---
I think some of you guys dont understand what a pyramid scheme is. in a pyramid scheme you **always** need someone "under" you too to make profit.
---
here its more of circle. guy "above" gives you mats to convert, you, the guy "under" him, give him your time and spirit shards (at this point YOU could scam HIM), you transfer back the mats, he pays you.
---
I finished griffo doing skyhorse collections xdxd
---
Yep this tedium is why I still have 25k spirit shards lying around, not worth the effort when I can just buy something, hold it for half a year and sell for 100% profit.
---
Anet does not do good quest clues.
---
I made exordium with minimal TP purchases (curios, mostly. I vastly underestimated just how much those took and bought out a bunch when they were the last thing I needed), and the thought of going map to map plinking trash to death for the hearts makes me queasy.
---
Apart from Day 1 and day 5, I kind of enjoyed the Skyscale collection. It even got me enjoying a few maps I hated and avoided before, like Jahai.
---
I liked the video actually. Only a couple gripes I have with it is that you used planet earth to zoom into instead of Tyria and the Norn doesn't have 6 infusions and legendary weapons so he looks like a lightbulb.
---
&gt; Is there a class/spec you can suggest that is not THAT gear dependent and is doing good in pugs ? I'd prefer being DPS.
---
GW2's gear setup is quite different to WoW and meta gear can actually be very cheap for basic power DPS. Basically, you need to get the right tier (exotic is second-best and it's fine), the right stats (*really* makes a difference, but berserker (power, precision, ferocity) is easy to get and high DPS for many playstyles) and a set of runes and sigils to provide further boosts to stats. 
---
This is actually fairly easy to do, although you won't be able to afford it for a little while unless you really optimise gold and karma (secondary currencies are *very* much a thing in GW2) farming for a week or two. 
---
The playstyle is *night-and-day* different as GW2 is much more focussed on active damage mitigation - dodging is a core mechanic and blocking is very active. Facetanking is basically Not a Thing - try tank like in WoW and you'll have a dead tank. I'd say it was broadly tab-target offence and action-combat defence.
---
Thief is generally a low-responsibility, medium-difficulty DPS class that you might get on with. Warriors are generally high DPS, but are almost always expected to sacrifice some skills for group-wide buffs in raids (aka "banner slave").
---
If its a good elite specs, yes, of course.
---
I play an S/D condi thief, I can handle most holosmiths in 1v1 (because they're bad) but as soon as I encounter a slightly above average holosmith i am in for a (not so) fun ride.
---
I'll never forget this one time when a holosmith decided to solo our lord and 3 of us attacked him. So it was basically 1 elite mob, 4 normal npc's and 3 players against this holo. We barely brought him to 20% (our lord was 50%) and he went into stealth. We couldn't find him at all, and then he jumps out of stealth with the holo5 skill, full health and I eat it all because i was not expecting it the least bit. One more hit and I was downed, don't remember if he killed me or not though. but either way, that was bullshit.  A horrible combo of a really good player and an OP (jack of all trades, master of most) class.
---
Thankfully we won, because even though that holo was an amazing player, his team was composed of useless complete pushovers... So there's that.
---
Someone who still needs to do it here - Wandering the open world to collect things for hours just sounds awful to me lately. Especially when the reward is something I can't even use in my regular gameplay (running through the open world and win by pressing 1? No thanks, I'll do fractals and play something else afterwards.)
---
The raptor is not a reward for the story quest. 
---
It is bought from the heart merchant after helping him save the village. 
---
All core mounts are bought from heart npc
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Yeah I get you, I also tend to make pale (but ginger hair) norns. But she was a raven tribe theme I brought to live haha
---
You can surely get the shoulders for medium. It‚Äôs a gemstore item, for all classes
---
If you do a makeover of your ranger I‚Äôd love to see!
---
Thank you!
---
Watched the whole thing and I can say its genuin - but if you **looking for quick gold pamsy scheme** you are out of luck.
---
The "rich" folk there arent here neither for extorsion of your gold neither for "we love you all" . They need more people in, as they make money in big part from advancing materials using of ther spirits shards and then craft legendaries which they sell - exchange for more materials, which they transmute to higher tier to craft more lege.... But they get to place when them, and people under them, "the middle class" as they call it, are out of spirit shards and need more people to do the busy works. As was mention elsewhere in this thread - you need to do shitons of clicking to use hundread not mention several thousends spirit shards, but then its easy gold for you and materials (more gold) for them.
---
Depend on what person you are - you may like this (farming events, dungeons etc for exp and getting more spirit shards -aka more gold) or not (as its busy work). 
---
What I personally get from video is that I can use my spirit shards to transmute my materials to higher tier to fuel my crafting -its gold loss but you dont need to wait for TP or thinking too much in game :) And even use things I thinking were worthless like bronze and gold to make more gold this way.
---
All in all is intersting video which show that things like karma and spirit shrads, which many called worthless have quite a nice price tag - if you are willing to work for it.
---
It can turn into real money in several ways. Do you really think that they have never done that ?
---
Oh hell yeah. I‚Äôd personally love black shadow animals of the wild where the heads are skulls showing
---
If you want some "easy farm", then I can give you some suggestions:
---
* PvP. Play ranked in season, play daily automated tournaments. Get good, win monthly tournament once they are fixed back into the game. Brutal money around there. You get 15/30 silver for each played game, reward track loot, ranked pips chests, achievements....
---
* Fractals, dungeons are easy to do but without dedicated group it can be slow based on actual lfg. Raids as well. It all grants big money if you are capable to clear them with some degree of ability :)
---
* At small scale, dailies 2g, tequatl 2g, Anomaly boss 1 mystic coin, HoT&amp;PoF metas give hero's choice chests once per day that include amalgamated gemstones, that's 1g+ alone per that gemstone (don't sell those if you want to craft gen2 legendaries). Daily crafts.
---
On top of that you get all the loot that give a lot of materials. Again, don't sell if you intent to use it for your own stuff, as that will save you gold (at least trading post taxes).
---
You can still play absolutely huge variety of content, pvp, wvw, some metas, worldbosses, jump into Orr to farm mobs at Arah defense/temples, do events on maps with good t6 trophy reward in map bonus reward track...you can do everyday something different, and you will profit anyways. Easiest is to just open LFG and look through it and join groups that are up just at the moment, wandering from activity to activity. No two days same content, so you won't probably get bored, and much of that still has entertainment value, not only pure gold gains.
---
Have done it ... since the revamp of unid gear it is only a shadow of it's former self.
---
Completely changes the blistering abyss, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
Yeah, I don't see it outside of the drawing.
---
It would not be fair, it would be harmful and it will become even more harmful as the trend continues.
---
You saying they dont owe anything? They owe us a non-p2w game, as that is the foundation of trust that has made many people, including me, buy this game and spend money on it in the first place. I dont know what sparked all this bullshit in your head, but get a grip already
---
&gt; You mean like "they recruited me into their guild two months ago, and then I recruited all my guild members under me, and now you guys can join in!"
---
no. read the second part of my post. they get gold too for their "services". in a pyramid scheme they wouldnt get any gold, **if they not scam other new members**
---
that the funny thing -he or she may actually not knowing that. He may live in fantasy how great socialism was and how awesome lives people live in those countries back in the day -which make him young, very illiterate and terribly naive.... 
---
Or he want just what actual people in socialism did - get something while doing little to nothing and keep it doing untill all actually working people died out ....
---
well, my opinion of the latest WP video, is that those guys are super-suspicious and i am sure they are easily breaking terms of contract....  
---
let me explain quick and easy, only 2 years playing, alrready the richest player in the game,
---
You're taking this movie too seriously for your own good.
---
Ha ha now that was unexpected
---
Endless Grandma Tonic - imagine the possibilities!
---
Hey Jeremy Corbyn I didn't know you played GW2.
---
This is some next level of roleplaying.
---
I would pay for fluff elite speccs like the minstrell
---
yep i know,i had it  4 hours after release XD
---
1k gold can be easily sold for 25-30‚Ç¨
---
That show was hilarious.
---
No they're not difficult to get. Just takes some time, a little bit of gold, and 250 of each LW4 map currency. If you don't have charged quartz then it will take some more time or some more gold.
---
Fully intentional :p
---
I think OP is talking about the new map that will be released tomorrow with Icebrood Saga.
---
What
---
Well do you want to play a game or get a job?
---
He is playing this as a job with daily tasks and a schedule and whatnot.
---
There is nothing impressive about what he does, and there is no fun in it either.
---
Most people dont do this because they cant be bothered to waste hundreds or thousands of hours into accumulating pixel money.
---
Might as well make real money in that time.
---
In boring moments I pondered about this issue myself and the most appealing solution I could come up with, would be to change how WvW is working rightnow.
---
I'd build the WvW like PvE maps and split the map up into  event chains. Every big "meta event" would have several small pre events, which must be achieved in order to launch the big one. This way "attacking the big mid castle" couldn't be done right from the get go, but would be "called out for" beforhand. Now there are many small tasks, which must be done before the big attack can happen, thus in first step the small roamer teams have their fun, in second step the ~20 men blobs can have fun and in the last step the mega blob is allowed to exist as well.
---
---------------
---
This idea would mean a lot biger maps and more npc enemies / friends and tasks connected to them. Thus I can imagine a lot of "no likey" from the WvW community, because a lot of them seem to dislike te existence of NPC factions in a PvP mode.
---
You can't enter LS3/4 maps without owning them, not with a teleport either.
---
You can't.
---
Yes.
---
Oooof I don‚Äôt know what that works - never done that before. How would it be done?
---
It's more than 250 years after er the first game. But who knows. There might be some lore related to GW1.
---
Start it yourself, get the ball rolling.  Are you on NA?  If so I can help you.
---
Years ? It paid in less tha. Six months just from mystic coins and t6 materials and keyfarming and so on
---
Mesmer bots are one of the most common one, and they can waste so much of your time if you bother trying to engage them on a node.
---
A whole account was cheaper than 4 characters slot
---
How shady, glad I logged in every patch day to unlock season 4; wasn't playing GW2 much that year (never made it past episode 4 actually) but at least I avoided being punished for not playing.
---
Now you just need to upgrade your new daughter and you'll be finally free!
---
I feel like they really made this a grind because they knew they weren't releasing anything for a while. I normally enjoy unlocking stuff in this game but this felt so bad overall.
---
Scourges don't one shot, it is more skills than just one. Don't cleanse as soon as you get a condi on you, wait until there is enough that it will do serious damage. Be ready to dodge out of shroud, and know the difference between placing the sand shade and the actual animation of the shroud.
---
Be aware that boons you have on you are probably going top be corrupted. I love seeing stab on people when playing shroud, as it corrupts into fear.
---
With Scourge they can transfer condi back to you with staff 4, or with plague signet. 
---
Not sure about build, I don't play guardian. I am not a fan of burn guard as it doesn't have many cover condis and it is easy to cleanse. 
---
Treb for the most part is a waste of time. WIth a team mate on treb all game it is like being a man down.
---
Best tips for surviving is learning how to kite, and the mini jumping puzzles on kite and no port spots. You can learn a lot of these watching youtubers. 
---
Also don't stick in every fight if it looks like it is going badly. Bail out before you or your team wipes. Even if it means leaving team mates to die outnumbered.
---
Ooo! Yes, and thanks a lot!!
---
Ah damn, I only remember the WvW one because it's where you had to go get it at launch (or as a PvP skin)! Didn't realise they added levelling gear.
---
It's on The Table
---
KKomrade
---
Appreciated. I'll consult a guide, someone above said it takes about 2 days of grinding. That seems doable
---
Yeah, maybe a couple 50 bucks.
---
Gryphon was alot easier for me to do, skyscale has fucking dragged, the first couple collections for it I hated, but you get to one where you imbue the eggs with various magic and that had alot more fun parts to it, all I've got to do now is finish my feeding and what comes after, I would say overall it's worth it however I don't see my self using skyscale much once it's unlocked, however the gryphon I use more than all the other mounts put together so for me it was well worth it
---
Condi is generally the higher dps as it can tick through. You forgot Demios for chains, cairn it isnt a "Must" (although it is nice) VG is a must (red split) overall it's generally higher dps in longer phases or bosses that require specific mechanics or have specific phases that dont wipe stacks but make it really hard to continue dps, that's why *generally* condi is king.
---
no, it's just a trolly lowman
---
what Titan said, but the reason why we took it was for the cleave during the burst phase. We just needed some form of bursty class to deal with them and since the kill wasn't that challenging overall, we went for reaper.
---
How is it based on Game of Thrones. What because its set in a snowy area. Guess what LOTR has snowy areas, so does WoW. I dare say every MMO game has snowy areas are they all based on game of thrones.
---
I'd say 90% of his vids are. WP just makes podcasts with game footage overlayed onto them. Unless he's analysing trailers, and that's still very listenable, you don't even need to glance at the video most of the time.
---
Yeah this sub is pretty ridiculous atm but don't worry about that, keep posting this sort of stuff.  It's so off the wall that it's awesome and I actually laughed which is always a good thing.
---
Aside from an expansion it is the only thing I would pay for.
---
I wouldn't pay for the living world, and I don't care about cosmetics.
---
She's Agatha from lake Loric right? Haven't met with her yet but looking forward to it.
---
Check the description of WP's video, there's a Discord invite link there to their Discord server
---
GW2 was my first MMO, and I'm still playing it on and off after 7 years. At first the fact that it had no sub fee was just nice, but now that the base game is free there's really no reason not to give it a try, imo.
---
Damn, I'm scared! I was on my edge doing Griffon but in the end, it was worth it, but I truly hated every step of making. I saw Skyscale guide once and was like... O_O FUCK THIS SHIT. I think I really need this mount, after years of free-flying in WoW early GW22 without mounts at all was... errrr.
---
It's free, the community is really nice. Give it a try and don't be scared to ask questions on /map people love helping newcomers
---
What's wrong with "First legendary after 6 years of playing"? I play almost since the start (casually and from time to time) and did not try to gain ane legendary =_=.
---
It's commonly known as the most casual-friendly MMO out there. You don't have to grind it all day long if you don't want to and still have fun and progress. So it's probably still the best MMO for beginners on the market. Also ArenaNet (the developers of the game) are very focused on making the game newbie-friendly.
---
The game is pretty accessible to someone who wants to check it out. You can just create an account and can play the whole core game to try it out. However, you will be under certain restrictions like chat, trading post and other things to prevent bots and gold sellers from spamming everyone to the mists and back.
---
You can lift the restrictions by buying the Path of Fire expansion. There are actually two expansions but when you buy the latest you will get access to both.
---
GW2 is oriented more for casual players but you can spent a lot of time in it if you want to. Personally I am over 5000 hours right now over the last 7 years and currently running out of things to do that interest me.
---
Guild Wars 2 has a continuing story through the core game (that you can play), Living world and the expansions. Living world is, so far, split into Seasons and while season 1 is not accessible now (because it was temporary content) you can still play season 2-4. Tomorrow we get the prologue of the new Season 5 or rather Icebrood Saga. A thing to note here, if you login at the time when an episode releases you will get this episode unlocked for free of your account even if you can't play it. What I mean by that is that certain seasons require an expansion to be playable. Season 3 requires Heart of Thorns, Season 4 and the Icebrood saga requires Path of Fire. Since you only need to buy Path of Fire you will be able to play season 3 and 4 after you have bought them and if you login after the patch tomorrow you will be able to play the Prologue as well, of course if you reached level 80. As for season 2, you only need to buy it to play it.
---
As for the FAQ on "when should I buy the expansion", as a free account player you should buy it sooner rather than later because it will lift the restrictions and give you access to the login rewards which will give you additional stuff each day you login.
---
So, in the end, get the free account login and play the game and when you like it after trying it out for a while buy the Path of Fire expansion.
---
I guess they are handled the same as other LS 3 map currency something like 100-200
---
When your grand daughter stares down your throat and says "it's so beautiful", only in GW2.
---
&gt; Then I'll admit that I am bad, but it is a hard maneuver. I await your video.
---
The video still proves nothing in this situation. If your argument is "Wah wah, I can't do it, therefore I find it impressive" then that's fine. You are allowed to find it impressive, whether that's because you don't practise or whether that's because you find it difficult.
---
&gt; Practice a piano enough and it becomes very easy. I don't know about you, but I find that impressive regardless. I also find OP flying the griffon well impressive if he practiced a lot for it.
---
As somebody who plays piano, this is a fucking garbage example. Playing piano well isn't just about being able to hit keys, it's about knowing how to read sheet music or, arguably a more impressive talent still, knowing enough about music to be able to hear a song, identify and memorise the notes and then replicate it with practise. Playing a piano is far, far more impressive even on more standard levels than flying a griffon in a video game and I'd almost wager that it's a little disrespectful to compare the two on a technical level. They're not the same and not even close to being the same.
---
Since you all love videos so much, here's a challenge for you: why don't *you* post a video showing me how supposedly difficult it is? Go on. I'm waiting. You can give me the YouTube link whenever you're ready. If you're so determined that video evidence of somebody doing something emphatically proves that that thing is easy or difficult, then you should be able to upload your own videos showing me just how supposedly hard it's meant to be.
---
Go ahead. I'll wait.
---
I just play the game really- but to be honest, I have never really commited. I‚Äôve played for like a week or two, and then quir for months or even years in this period. I just get so overwhelmed with what my goals should be, and how to achieve them
---
Because sometimes you just don't want to melee?
---
We tried getting a new instance last Wednesday by gathering a ton of people and jump to force the game to open a new instance,  but we kept getting stuck on ip 22.
---
Tomorrow is patch day, try again right after the patch and should be good!
---
Well to be honest - I have 5 characters at 80, unlocked elite specs (none of them fully complete tho) and I dont really have anything of value. I‚Äôve played the game in intervals over the years, never truly commited and always feel overwhelmed and dont know which goals I should seg my self.
---
I'm trying to hold onto hope but I'm low key a little shifty eye nervous at how Anet are going to do Norn and Charr justice with one living world season when Sylvari had multiple living story seasons and an expansion yet still had major arcs and beats like the Nightmare Court and Malyck get left on the cutting room floor. I'm hoping Anet haven't bitten off more than they can chew again and that it's all going to turn out well.
---
I had a gw2 break and I play episode 3 at the moment. And since the beetle is new in this episode I looked for guides for both and read them. So I'm basically at zero when it comes to map currencies of that season. 
---
I'm already annoyed by the beetle collection because I need to kill some bosses that only appear every x hours.
---
Both. It's not hard to get geared up in exotics(2nd best tier), with proper runes and sigils. But still a lot of ppl run around in greens with mismatched stats and random runes...  
---
Learning your class machanics is the harder part. Ranger and necro have a low skill floor to learn.  
---
Also - mostly in expansion maps, you need to learn positioning and adjusting your skills and rotation to every encounter.
---
That's exactly how I play, from day -2. I stopped playing when season one started and came back at the start of HoT, usually play a couple of weeks when I'm on leave but then have to take huge breaks when I'm away for 3+ months. I made my first legendary earlier this year, and I never ever have over 100g in my wallet ha! It was an insane grind for someone like me to get it done, it's nice to have the skin, but it's not something I'd recommend if you aren't playing every day. It burnt me out completely and I didn't even have the game installed again until a week or so ago, mostly due to the burnout.
---
The best thing I found about the legendaries now (I made a gen. 2 one, Nevermore) is that you can do them, for the most part, in bite-size chunks. One day I did the fractals in an hour or so, the next day it was another part, etc. Some of them are impossible to do like that because you need *insane* amounts of mats and I needed to level artificing up to 400+ for some of the crafting requirements and the final part with all the gifts you need is very overwhelming when you first look at it, but if you break it down again into smaller parts, you'll progress a lot faster than you think.
---
TBH just go for a class that you will find interesting. You don't have to stick to classes that are boring to you.
---
i probably get the full game
---
I mean I was in that game as a holo (on the other side) and to be honest with you it doesn't matter what we played...
---
a) we had both naru and grim carrying us
---
b) actually there is build diversity in the 3 holos (lyrae runs weird builds)
---
c) both your herald and you were farmable... (yes I still farmed the rev playing a soulbeast variant in later games)
---
My wife play TESO so i think that she will understand me xD
---
&gt; Also - mostly in expansion maps, you need to learn positioning and adjusting your skills and rotation to every encounter.
---
But does it matter on solo? for example. I have a kill the Stun opponent when using the skill behind him. Now, when I'm Solo 1v1 with a mob - I can't get behind him as his aggroring me. So this section of the skill only works in group fights where someone else has the aggro?
---
Thanks! I always used the button 1 attack to initiate my dive. So this‚Äôll help with finesse. Of course, I just unlocked my Skyscale... but I‚Äôll always love my griffon.
---
I see. So it's getting better once I hit those Masteries on 80? :-)
---
Im not responding to all of that :X they are earning money, by providing a healthy game and offering paid conveniences like fashion stuff. Just because it doesnt have a price tag, does not mean that they're doing it for free. The amount of (more or less) voluntary transactions has been enough to keep them going for 7 years. People saying no to p2w arent choosing beggars, but patrons.
---
GW2 is a very different games to other MMOs and there are many who can't get into it. test it out and then buy it. Wouldn't be that great spending the money on the expansion and then after a week not liking it.
---
:( Can you tell how sad I am? :( if :( you :( can't :( maybe :( this :( will :( help :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
---
I got my skyscale recently but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm using it wrong. The blue altitude meter drops even when I‚Äôm flying level to the ground. It only stops draining if I angle it a bit slanted towards the ground, where I‚Äôll inevitably land after some distance.
---
Kinda feel robbed with it. I thought it was gonna be freeflying with a couple of additions (like the wall grab). Instead it‚Äôs just a griffon that can hover, or a springer on easy mode. Could someone explain to me how this mount is supposed to be used?
---
I see. It does sounds like it's getting better later on, thanks!
---
But stay away from pvp section
---
Gathering, opening chests, daillies are all gated account wide, not sure how much.
---
Hearts + gamble chest in the center are per character.
---
The "Meta" isnt gated AFAIK, but not sure on that one.
---
You will mainly be limited by your amount of characters if you want to farm 250 a day. But its not impossible.
---
That whole finale was really just a greater scale of Androcles and the Lion.

[This gearing guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character), specifically buy cheap [named armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) (honestly the free runes you get are fine for open world, can think about upgrading later). Power Druid is not meta anywhere and the Druid spec doesn‚Äôt add any damage. I‚Äôd suggest just a base ranger build [like this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery) if you really don‚Äôt want to run soulbeast. Condi ranger (or even Druid...) are also options, you can check the gearing guide for where to get viper gear.
---
It's not that bad. Put some effort on it but don't stress yourself, you don't have to get it ASAP. And when you'll get it you'll love it :)
---
WvW medium armor in charr is three horns... Oh wrong one
---
Hey i finished it yesterday. cool XD
---
each map had a meta event, doing that nets currency too.
---
I can totally relate to this! Recently got my skyscale after grinding since it was released (with a few short breaks from the game)
---
Yeah this is kind of how I understood it as well. I'd someone says "2 days of grinding", I just sort of take that as "48 hours of grinding" :p
---
If you hate it, don't do it.
---
Am I'm not there yet T_T
---
&gt; It's not like they don't use their own resources too. The guy said he had 12 spirit shards right now.
---
So? They are doing *some* work, but they are *also* profiting off the labor of others. Why should that be a thing? Why shouldn't the other members of the group not make 100% of the profit their labor is worth?
---
&gt;They pay others for that resource - and that happens to be grunt work, but it's not the primary motivation.
---
But why not, instead of paying others for their shards, and then with minimal effort turning those shards into something considerably more valuable, they just tell those players what to convert their own shards into and those players could sell the "best possible thing," instead of just middleware?
---
yes, you cant play missions / join maps if you don't have access to them
---
Having done it many times in the past, I would add that it is extremely annoying. After many years of playing, I‚Äôve decided to stop doing this sort of thing just for the sake of gold, and my overall pleasure from the game has definitely increased.
---
&gt; Im not responding to all of that :X they are earning money, by providing a healthy game and offering paid conveniences like fashion stuff.
---
That provides *some* money, but not necessarily *enough* money to cover the *costs* involved in producing "a healthy game." If they decide they need to charge for elite specs, it's because they need the money those would bring in.
---
&gt;The amount of (more or less) voluntary transactions has been enough to keep them going for 7 years.
---
In addition to two paid expansions, don't forget, which included access to 16 elite specs in total. Those weren't given out for free. 
---
&gt;People saying no to p2w arent choosing beggars, but patrons.
---
No, they're hypocrites if they ever bought HoT or PoF and "paid to win" with those.
---
Nah, Rob Kappa.
---
Quick! Everybody join their discord lol.
---
"corne" is latin for horn :)
---
in other words, turn your own spirit shards in to gold your selves!
---
The difference in my activity before starting to craft Ipos and after was very small:  Once I started crafting Ipos, I stopped to mine mithril / chop elder wood, whereas before I just rode by.
---
Most of the mats I got were from salvaging, not farming nodes.
---
Just play the game. Do metas that reward lots of unID gear and salvage.  Sell rares/ecto for gold and buy more mats with that.
---
If you're trying to chop down 33k elder logs, you're doing it wrong.
---
Seeing this really makes me wish:  
---
1. Griffon got a proper tutorial after unlocking its features.  
---
2. They hadn't made the dive-boost so chunky.
---
[deleted]
---
That's one determined guy. Wow!
---
You could probably pass this as a female version of V from Devil May Cry. Even the familiars match.
---
Congratulations! Doubt I'll ever get mine as they cost way too damn much to get and take entirely too long.
---
I really don‚Äôt get whats so problematic about this collection. The only part I didn‚Äôt like was the saddle collection. And even this one is not really a chore. If don‚Äôt have time to farm maps, then just buy currency in dragonfall. It will take longer, but amount of time to do that is close to 0.
---
Yeah I really look forward to the beetle. I'm doing a lot of runs for iron, platinum and winterberries. The beetle will make this a lot faster. I hope, I can get those 2 boss kills tonight.
---
Yes, fair enough. I think it‚Äôs definitely something that puts you at risk for a ban though.
---
I farmed on Sat and Sun, 3 maps per day, and about one and a half hour for each toon on each map iirc. I was lucky enough to have totally free weekends so I just dig in.   
---
When I said "not that bad", I means it feels kinda like chilling out rather than feeling a lot of pressure while farming those. I am sorry if I sounded so misleading. You can get average 50/toon/map/day, so just spread it out accordingly.   
---
Also, I was lucky enough to run into lots of big group so I speeded up my farming a lot (probaly due to my timezone, UTC+7, I played at 11PM - 2AM here). So yeah, it is my personal advantage anyway, but I really don't feel "bad" about farming those, just take it steadily and enjoy it.
---
Coolest is subjective but it's definitely the prettiest
---
You're missing my point: I want both. I sometims feel like jumping into the fray, sometimes I wanna stand back and watch them die.
---
Now, I can pull them together with raptor, use sword 3, sword 2, roll back and use staff to hit them all with marks, use F1 and melee again, then maybe sword to finish off if necessary. And all these attacks are area attacks.
---
Well, yes. But we get that rest of desirable content from those expansions already for free.
---
I wish I had a chance to try to get the Skyscale, but between constant Error 7 disconnects and incompetent support staff (over a week for first response that only contained the exact same troubleshooting steps that I already tried from the forum), it seems I'll never be able to play this game again.
---
I'm probably not the best with maths but the last time I checked any legendary it costed thousands of gold. Yeah I'm lazy and all but to do chores daily for 1 year straight just to get 1 legendary when most characters would need 3 for just 1 build... and as I've noticed, some friends of mine who played pretty hardcore(ly) for some time, they also needed months just to get one. Anyway don't mind me, I'm just complaining that I can't progress in an MMO in a solo way, probably I was too used to GW1 with heroes where I could do nearly the whole content with just them. It would still please me tho that I wouldn't need to rely on anyone else.
---
Action camera with shaking enabled. Use steering wheel with force feedback.
---
Not playing Season 2 before Heart of Thorns isn't really Anet's fault and it shows pretty plainly in the Story Journal that the plot goes PS -&gt; Scarlet's War -&gt; Season 2 -&gt; Heart of Thorns (etc. etc.).
---
As for "having to pay more money for more content" being an issue or not isn't exactly clear cut. Some can argue yes while others no. Granted since they combined HoT and PoF into one, it would be good practice for them to include S2 and S3 in some form but not mandatory purchase unless it too becomes free.
---
And there are indeed LW Season bundles in the gemstore. They were even on sale last week. They don't show if you own thr entire season though, or lack the required expansions.
---
Yes, but we are already getting all of that for free through Living World. Why would you wait and pay for it when you already have it released for free if you show up to actually play it?
---
Thank you! Gearing guide is pretty good, totally forgot about some things. I think I'll try base ranger then =(. Also I hope there will be some playable druids specs in future.
---
Yeah if you didn't already have a good chunk of currency it was a pain. I luckily only had to farm thunderhead and Jahai, the others I had enough currency for.
---
It's 15 to 20 minutes for a T5 to T6 conversion.
---
WP has you covered.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br1h8AweJMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br1h8AweJMo)
---
Honestly, you ask sensible questions that mostly can't be answered with just a wiki link, which is why I remember your name... 
---
I work from home so I'm on reddit half the time because I am waiting for a load of other people's deadlines to kick in and haven't got much to do and the GW2 Q&amp;A thread fills time...
---
To be fair, you can be poor AF and not give a fuck about anyone's opinion.
---
what the fuck.
---
you think grinding hearts and pressing f is fun? no wonder this game is dying...
---
Money is as powerful enough what it can buy.
---
If less than intended people make legendaries, their price goes down. Normally it's not a problem, or shouldn't be. The problem is about GW2 trading system and tax. But currently, spirit shards are not used as much as it should.
---
I imagine, even videos like these won't solve the problem. While the main idea of this 2 hour video is "don't stash those 12k spirit shards but create something with them, use your map currencies and other non directly tradable but valuable tokens to generate gold", and while many people watched it, told about it, or simply knew about it, we won't use those spirit shards as much as we should.
---
Unless, Anet changes how mystic forge works. If there were recipes in mystic forge crafting, crafting in bulk -automated like normal crafting- that'd solve the issue once and for all. Nobody would have thousands of spirit shards in their arsenal. They would save some for just in case situations even. Material prices would go down, we'd have tons of cheap t6. Legendary values would mostly come from mystic coins, map explores, wvw tracks and gold sinks like runes.
---
In the end we'd have a more healthier market, which promotes playing and getting exp over flipping stuff on TP and farming trains for raw materials alone. When other materials are cheaper and allows to put some budget into other raw farming materials like ectos, then we'd see a rise in ecto price for example. Market would balance itself after a while. But players would get their desired products far faster than they do now.
---
After watching this, I asked random wvw players, SW train farmers and some people I keep seeing idling on several trading posts around the world and each answered within numbers of 1000k to 10000k spirit shards. This is gold they have and don't use, because it's troublesome to use. It's not fun to sit and change t5 materials to t6.
---
TLTR: for what they talked about to be largely feasible for GW2 player base, first Anet needs to change how Mystic Forge works.
---
I can =). Also, I was thinking about Viper Burst Burning Reaper with scepter/dagger, which weapon could be used there as second, staff?
---
We might need a second round, actually
---
Yes, I remember you name too. That's a good time to say thank you for all on-going help :-)
---
Op asked if people would be happy to see elite specs in the gemstore (rofl), not for a discussion about the morality of EA's business model and its appliance to gw2... I came here because op brainfarted and someone had to open the window
---
No, it's not. 
---
I literally never use the skyscale for anything except maybe afking
---
complaining about talking sh\*t in ranked PvP competitive matches. There is not one without the other.
---
The fastest way to make gold is to get a full time job that pays real money and convert money to gold. If you are going to do such tedious tasks, you may as well earn more than minimum wage for your time.
---
I think that you really underestimate how stuff can accumulate over time in material storage. I have full alts of wood and mithril ingots...
---
Also, there is no point to go full legendary on every character...legendary is meant to be for those builds where you want to switch stuff a lot. And while weapons are usually bound to be power or condi based on skills the weapon provides, you usually don't want to switch stats on weapons. It is okay to be with ascended weapons, and go for legendary armor instead, as that gives you main bulk of switchable stats so you can play totally different build. You will play different weapons anyways usually. And getting legendary armor is quite easy within pvp.
---
Braham: The Dark World was his role in S3. We're entering Braham: Ragnarok.
---
Norn = Norse. Charr = Roman/Mongol.
---
I've been farming my home instance and unintentionally had all the map currencies before I even started skyscale.  The wait a day/come back later stuff was the hardest part for me.  Everything else was just a pleasant, enjoyable journey.
---
I mean, there's nothing to prevent a player from doing that. The person selling the shards can easily compare the value of their own resources compared to what they would make from the TP. The TP is going to tax you, however. That's one of the main points of the video - to avoid the TP tax as much as possible. 
---
There's also the possibility that the person doing the grunt work doesn't want to actually do the things necessary to produce the final product (legendaries). They can still make money from this process as a middle man. Your argument is basically "Why do middle men exist? Why not go to the source?"
---
You've obviously decided it's not for you, that's fine. I still see how this could be a win-win for all involved. It just depends on how much effort you want to put into it. The ones doing the grunt work and selling their shards are the medium effort workers. The top dogs are putting in max effort and they are telling you straight up that if you don't want to do max effort, there is still money to be made at a lower level.
---
W, S front and back.
---
A, D strafe
---
Mouse for turning, sometimes action cam is fine as well (depends on the content).
---
Personally I use Q and E for skill 7 and 8 while C is reserved for skill 9.
---
Heal skill and Elite are on side mouse buttons 4 and 5.
---
F1 to f4 are spread from shift to Y X C B and dodge on V.
---
Might take some time to get used to it.
---
i dont use A/D as strafe, its default. i use right mouse + A/D to strafe.
---
instead of 67890 i use ZXC for utilitities, Q for elite, E for heal
---
alt+12345 for f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 (my keyboard has them quite far)
---
v for dodge, disable double tap
---
side button on my mouse is to draw/hide weapon (for interrupting skill casting)
---
disable autotarget, melee assist.
---
don't make left click work same as right click, you wont be able to look behind while running forward.
---
those are just few off the top of my head
---
you are such a idiot OP. Haha. "I will media know about it" hahaha . Sure my dude, sure. You think it would work and they will be scared and give you your item back? You are the most stupid person I have seen on this reddit. You are just a little shit, no one care, no one will care. You are no one, you mean nothing.And you are also wrong here.  
---
They gave you the right answer, they were very nice to you actually, and you still treated them like bad people? You are disgusting human.  
---
Please gtfo from this game and from internet as well actually.
---
Grinding hearts or grinding SW, what's the difference? I spent my heart grinding time trying to figure out the most efficient way to get them done. I got a pretty good rythm in a bunch of them, including some fun with that teleporting gizmo.
---
People are asking for dungeons or raids they can do 1000 times, so they can be the very best at doing them the fastest. What's wrong with someone enjoying doing that that with something less intense? They are both mindless repetition at some point, just one requires quick reflexes and large amounts of time and the other is more relaxed.
---
It was made to keep Season 4 alive until Season 5 came out, just like Aurora tied Season 3 together. It has certainly kept people in those maps, farming currency. 
---
It's frustrating how many people see grind as just this nuisance thing that ANet puts in the game to annoy players. There is a reason MMOs need some things to take a while: the game only functions properly when there are other people in the maps with you, so they need there to be a reason for people to stick around after they've gone through and seen everything once.
---
Most certainly agree. A good coat of flame (or ice ) is past due!
---
They came with the last balance patch. I mean, those were PvE nerfs but you gotta give Anet credit for trying. But hey, how about mounts for PvP next instead of proper balance ? It worked for WvW right ? Right ?!
---
Previously that was about 2-3 months, they did say or hinted at faster releases but currently there isn't much to tell about it since they now call it a saga and not a season anymore and we don't know if they still call the individual releases episodes again or if they have a new term for them as well, as long as you login and get the "new story unlocked" screen you should be good though.
---
Haven't got mine yet and don't plan to.  It's too boring.
---
Yeah except War isn't part of the rock paper-scissor-system and instead is a goddamn nuclear submarine with laser raptors for emergency melee skirmishes.
---
Do you have to use meta builds and equipment or is there nor room to diverge from the established routines?
---
After 7 years i finally got my map 100%!!!11!
---
If you want to maintain height, you have to use wall jumping. Make sure you charge the jump fully. Then, it is all about maintaining your stamina and height max. Stepping on ledges to reset your height is also necessary.
---
You can get what you expect in small range and around terrain suitable for it - cliffs, ledges, and such. Skyscale is made with that in mind.
---
Also, look out for the rifts - those are easy "lifts" or "speedways", as you can dodgeroll from one ball of energy to another (picking it recharges stamina), you can be faster even than griffon, or gain height where you wouldn't otherwise.
---
If you want long range flight, that's where griffon should be used. Still there is "no mount is exclusively best for everything", each of them has their best case usage.
---
There's always room for non meta stuff as long as it's not completely useless, especially in normal raids. If 5 people can clear most raids without going over the timer, so can 10 with off meta builds.
---
Wow thats a long video... at least I hope its relevant, gonna like it regardless.
---
Exp itself has no other use except levels, masteries and shards.
---
My bet is on zoomers. There is an app, you have to use it
---
So for example, I have a greatsword/sword-pistol damage mesmer. A build would surely just get me kicked, no?
---
I haven't really ever tried to join a group because of the pressure to play meta builds after the base game dungeons. I just got back into the game and try to figure out what content I can do  without being pushed to look up the newest viable builds
---
That cursor looks so beautiful.
---
Blood rubies and  petrified wood is way lower than that. Winterberries are way higher if even capped. 
---
Anyways everything should be in the wiki.
---
Viper is expensive/hard to get stat combo - you'd usually skip straight to ascended with that. It's better take a cheap alternative stat like rabid, carrion or rampager for casual play.
---
You can still play with pets even as a soulbeast though. GS + x/wh is a decent open world build.
---
As for reaper you can easily buy a full set of exotics for about 20-30 gold on trading post or even buy in verdant brink and dungeons (there's probably more sources of exotic gear, but TP is quite cheap anyway).
---
&gt; takes out caladbolg
---
oh shieeet
---
Could you pls check if a video have already been posted before posting a video?
---
I have it as default mount, and use it most of the time. Rather have problems to actually remind myself to use other mounts when I should.
---
As I had all the materials except from thunderhead, as I played on all old maps for a bit when they released, it was zero grind for me so I don't have the need to consider it "worthy or not", so it is just added positive stuff for me with no big cost. But ye, I am not in a crowd of players that play new map for 2 hours and then go to forums bragging about "no content" so that's why I had the resources (and why I haven't had from thunderhead, as I slacked that map due to playing a lot of factorio back then :D ). I actually see those material costs as direct slap into face to all those with mindset of "rush clear new stuff then never touch it again unless it has top gold per hour". One could even get it over spring from just doing home instance farming....so the grind was in my opinion just nonexistant for normal players, and the rest forced it on themselves in a "must have it asap". But ye, I am probably just too much of a material storage hoarder :P
---
....What?
---
he didnt post the video though
---
He posted picture with added text. But I can see how one can overlook that.
---
If you buy each currency from the  dragonfall npc daily, it will take you 50 days of doing nothing n that's hand down the most tedious part
---
Hehe congrats. Yeah it takes so long time lmao. Im not finished yet lol
---
Can't tell if satire or honest.
---
35?
---
On The Table Edition‚Ñ¢
---
To be honest if you're in group content you should use something that benefits group, whether it's very high damage, support skills or even some utility, but not not all at once because you're sacrificing your main role for something that another person should cover.
---
So it's not just about using meta builds, but your group composition needs to make sense.
---

Legendary weapons are long term goals. Why are you guys so impatient?
---
There is a shocking amount of memes available on the internet about this issue...too many to even consider linking one.
---
How long does it take?
---
All these posts are making me want to get back into the PvE stuff to get all these mounts. All I got is the raptor and warclaw.
---
&gt; Hey Anet, since your story is based on game of thrones
---
Actually it's based on GW1, but okay...
---
Maybe a way to trace the eggs tied to small events triggered by when you use the tracer near them would be better. Random locations, small events, a bit of storytelling.
---
Yes, that is true, and it is meant as a little story, an epilogue to something told in the Main Storyline. So, I don't consider this a timegate or a block, just a step forward, which is honestly a very interesting storytelling.
---
&gt; im pretty sure that u will in someway need the skyscale for LW5.
---
That seems unlikely. Do you think we'll need the rollerbeetle for something, too?
---
That's fine if the tracer is inaccurate enough (for example it could tell the name of the area the egg is in but not the location). Otherwise there's just no finding work involved.
---
This feature is called 2x speed :D
---
One suggestion I haven't seen offered for you yet, since you have Viper's gear for your Reaper and seem a bit leery about swapping away from condition damage, have you tried Scourge out?  You can keep using Scepter with it, the Shades give you a new method to inflict conditions as well as doing other things, and it's definitely set up to benefit from condition damage rather than power.
---
I really agree, it's made gathering very interesting again.  I'm not really sure ascended cooking/planting/harvesting is actually profitable, but selling the seeds is at least.
---
I see, maybe a circle on map, but not with a trail like those we usually have?
---
That would be ideal to me.
---
thats the think with the noods in the home instanz it isent so worse, like when u have to farm them on the maps, the nods an the maps are teriebel so u only have the hearts to do it kinda efectiv, that is just not fun.
---
Hi !   
---
I'm a returning player and noticed I have a lot of chests from very old PvP rewards. I never reached endgame but I played a lot instanced PvP because i thought it was fun.   
---
Should i keep those chests because the weapons in it are good for lvl 80 or can I already open them just to have the cool skins ?
---
After playing a lot of Warframe, I can appreaciate time-gates a little more as a player. They're still annoying, but Warframe does it well. Put simply:
---
There's stuff to do during said time-gates.
---
As a solo player, I'm dreading the Skyscale collection and as much as I love dragons, I'm seriously considering not doing it, period. There's no queue system for dungeons/raids and LFG is flooded with groups with mostly arbitrary requirements. Plus, the rewards are stingy at best; doubly so for Metas. Sure, I could hope Shadow Behemoth's up and try to get that scythe skin for the umpteenth time, but why would I bother? There's really no other reason/reward to play and I've been fairly casual since release. So yeah, engagement is the issue.
---
congrats!! :D 
---
I haven‚Äôt even fully started yet, I‚Äôm still at the part where I have to find the eggs but I already know that I won‚Äôt be doing it.. I‚Äôm way too lazy lmao my Gryphon is enough
---
can you mount/dismount inside enemy territory tho? I tought it was like gliding that you could not glide inside enemy territory.
---
Lol condi overall has almost every power class beat in  terms of raw damage output especially for small hitboxes by [almost 5k dps](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) nearly every class has a boost in condi vs power. Cairn it's not a requirement to bring condi, VG it is because **you do no damage to red split** cairn you can range or burst when he stops teleporting. Skipping mechanics, yeah, maybe 1-2 bosses tops has to have a invulnerability to burst phase to skip. Gorse for example you already have your condi maxed out for no updrafts, the burst isnt needed because *its already ramped up* any condi class worth their weight would already have full stacks at the burst phase. you are talking optimal builds that are for speed clears, I'm talking about overall numbers and pugs which is what he will be doing.
---
well,when i started gw 2 it had  20 GB and it grows asf,every ls is about 1-2 gb so in few years we gona be at 100 GB :/
---
I think what Op means is the "soon‚Ñ¢" text.
---
No, of course I know it's not an actual pyramid scheme. I meant only that, because it is a closed economy with very limited resources, those making the big money are relying on the "workers" below them to support their means of making the big gold.  I more meant that the video tries to sell people on the dream of making big gold, when really most players don't have a chance of making it themselves.  Their role is very specific: to increase the speed at which the real earners accumulate wealth, by flooding the market with more raw materials.
---
and its naru on holo and grim ooof

~~For fans, by fans~~ Coming Soon, Arriving Soon‚Ñ¢
---
They also need people with demand for the goods they produce (Legendaries). They want to increase the wealth of the community so there's still demand, which creates a margin they can exploit (account bound currency valuation).
---
Their message here is kind of counter-productive though, because they also say people should be making stuff themselves. Any new people who take this to heart and start to make money though this wouldn't be their customers.
---
&gt;~~Could you pls check if a video have already been posted before posting a video?~~

~~Could you pls check if your comment actually makes sense before posting a comment?~~

For this event it works though. Someone will do it. You put your piece in and move on so everyone has the maximum amount of opportunity to contribute as well
---
You did need the roller beetle to get into places blocked by stone doors. Though I guess if you didn't want to do that content, you could just avoid everything that needed one, or get a mesmer port. But that's true of pretty much every mechanic in the game.
---
That said I do agree I wish they had made more content that required roller beetles, especially since they were so easy to get.
---
Child of my Child. Comments you can hear man. Gives me chills every time I read it.
---
I totally get that. I was definitely overwhelmed initially as well. For me, the way I like to go about it is creating lists/spreadsheets. When I crafted my legendary armor, I had a spreadsheet with the four components for each armor piece and each component was further divided into its subcomponents. That way I had a basic idea of what I needed to accomplish in terms of daily routines and more long term goals. That may be too much for some people but in general I think it helps to break down big tasks into bite size pieces and slowly knock them out. Hope this helps!
---
It wouldn‚Äôt change much. If I was easier to use, too many would do it, dropping the value to a point most wouldn‚Äôt bother using them again. 
---
Just look at crafting and all the opportunities to make gold out of people willing to buy convenience/not willing to go through the crafting process/not knowing how much cheaper they can get the desired object.
---
And the amount of cabbage jokes in game....always good for a laugh
---
Use your spirit shards seems the be the main message.
---
PvP gear is all standardised now (not sure how old "very old" means but there used to be PvP-specific gear). The current system is basically that you can set your own stats for the gear. 
---
95% sure that you might as well just open them and see if there are any valuable skins to sell and then salvage the rest.
---
It's been a couple of years since I really grinded it out, but gold making through the TP is really fun for some people. Sure, there are ultra-tedious ultra-time consuming tasks you can run that have good returns, but speculating, problem solving, and predicting other people's behavior is much more interesting than flipping burgers.
---
Only 1 skill you really should dodge -- corona burst.
---
Well, I don't know, but yeah.. probably just one person needs to talk to raptor npc to push the story so the second person might have missed that.
---
I'm down to the feeding stage and I lost all interest. It's way too arcane in the way it has to be done. I get that they wanted go gate it, but there is a point where interest is lost.
---
Praise Johto!
---
That isn't data. That's you guessing.  Yes, the playerbase is largely casual meaning that most people are not "hurting for shards" as you asserted.  You only think you are correct on this matter.  Feynman quote again: you are the easiest person to fool.
---
Because I'm a father to a new baby and can't group often as he wakes up randomly, I wanted a profession I can solo all content with (except Raids/Fractles ofc). I hated World of Warcrfat and quited, because content was locked around Groups and gear you can get while only in groups. I don't mind Elmentalist to be squishy - if the only reason I will die being squishy is my lack of profession knowledge or lack of skill. But if playing perfect I still won't be able to solo content - that's probably won't be for me. That's why I went with Ranger - because it Can.
---
&gt;  for switching between look and cursor
---
So the above is basically using Action mode?
---
"Turn" is not something you see often. SD is mostly Strafe on most of the games?
---
7 years here and not a single legendary, not even map completion.
---
You have to toggle it don't you? I couldn't find a way navigating menus in action mode?
---
Yeah i meant Turn the camera with Mouse and than move there i never use ad for the "Turn" Option thats indeed odd (in Base controls ad become Strafe while Holding right click)
---
Never found the right click to Swing camera to be odd i didnt Change much for camera Control and never read any specific disscussion about it 
---
Hope youll get to where you're comfortable
---
Touch√©
---
That is a good lesson for life in general. Every time you are tackling something huge, break it down into small bite sized pieces.
---
Any window, like dialogue or inventory, should automatically toggle Action Cam off until closed.
---
But yes, the best way to use it is with an easy-to-reach toggle key so you can turn it on/off at will.
---
I mean, op was suggesting to get a job in order to make gold, if THAT'S the reason why you're going to work, your prospective options probably aren't all that great.
---
Yup.  Just watch for it over the next couple days! He might be busy with some of the content release tomorrow.
---
Anyone got those yet? 
---
I still havent received an email :(
---
I did but did not notice it until I was already 500 and when I went to my home instance he was not there.
---
117g is roughly 70 days of login rewards. But most likely those are getting neatly stored away in an maxed out material storage. It shows that "playing the game since day one" means nothing without further informations about the habbits of that player.
---
Is there a TL;DR version?
---
I'm a returning player (been gone for a year now) and am without a guild.
---
Besides joining a guild, how do I get started? Should I look for a guild that is currently using this method?
---
I'm not looking to make hundreds of thousands of gold. Just under 10k.
---
as someone rading lots of malazan books full of swear words containing "balls", it needed your comment to notice my mistake...
---
Cool
---
I don't understand why crafting is now locked into achievements. Why have crafting xp at all then? Why not just make achievements/quests unlock the crafting profession. It all seems so unnecessary and it does not fit with any of the other crafting professions.
---
As a non holo player I rather theif and mirage be deleted than any other class changed.
---
250 of each currency is also a very asshole-ish move. You can't possibly compare 250 karly ore and 250 mistonium that the game is extra mega stingy. Not everyone has 20 alts to be able to farm hearts, limits on daily earning of currencies are rather harsh and overall it's an incredibly dull grind that makes me never want to go to any of those maps ever again.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they dropped loads of cash through credit cards to get started, or if they still do that.
---
You need all living world season 4 maps for it and complete the story of the last episode (ep6).
---
Don't forget the "remember that sick sky scale at the far edge of the map you were just at, go back but you better get there before the map closes".   I know this map doesn't take forever to traverse but it was just another added annoyance of making me back track a 3rd time to the exact same spot.
---
It's not that there's much point in hoarding, I just don't see that much stuff I really want. Recently I'm buying some stuff off the TP as attempted investments, just for the fun of it.
---
I still don't get why there's no direct trade in this game, it doesn't make any sense
---
Uhh.......this was a teaser how?
---
People are constantly begging for Elite Specs despite Anet saying they aren't in development when we already have **18** in the game. 
---
I highly doubt you've played all 18 specs + core specs to their fullest by now.
---
is this meant to be a meme or something
---
I buy bank slots, bag slots, mount skins now, I still need to get the bigger bags for all of my slots, I have 1 legendary. You may just play much, much more than other people if you have all that stuff and have extra money.
---
It got posted in [this thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/87248/bound-by-blood-is-coming-on-september-17/p1).
---
&gt; We‚Äôre a week away from The Icebrood Saga‚Äôs prologue episode, and we‚Äôll share **a few short teasers** with you in this thread during the coming week. Enjoy!
---
how many did u have to craft
---
All of this would not have been a problem if there was an alternate way for me to get the recipe i needed. Many of the new food recipes were available from the heroics notary vendor in WvW and I was expecting the recipes to be on there. I checked last night and they were not.
---
It will also be the 280th day since shattered aegis was GUTTED
---
A new game launcher design would be *cool*.
---
Or you know, you could also not get the skyscale.
---
This may have been my favorite part of the collection actually. I didn't previously spend a lot of time in Kourna or Sandswept and having to do these made me appreciate the maps more. I did get really tired of mining Crystal and wish there were even small amounts rewarded for events. But I'm not at all against the principle of "go back to these maps and earn currency". The currency just needs to be attached to fun aspects of the game not mining. That's what makes Dragon Fall so dang good, no hearts, some mining options, but mostly event driven map currency.
---
quality teaser
---
The **Íú±·¥è·¥è…¥**^‚Ñ¢ and Zzzz bits are obvious and unimportant.
---
What's important is knowing why the day counter was changed from 26 to 35, when no month lasts more than 31 days.
---
Another masterpiece\~ I particularly liked the description of TD, Aurene reassuring Snargle, and the really serious moment of determination...ruined by the shock of Kralk's voice XD
---
Kralk's throat must be *very* long for them to have such a lengthy conversation.
---
kept waiting for a punchline, got feelz instead 0/10 don't wanna feelz again
---
Kralk turned out to be a Tardis, so why not?
---
&gt;There is no gain in doing dungeons because there is not a lot of gold to gain from
---
This is utterly 100% false. Dungeons give some of the best gold in game, even more so if you have the recipes. Stop spreading nonsense, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about
---
&gt; How, where, which 
---
Yep, that is the part where the last part of my answer kicks in. But luckily there are also quick but not easy answers to it:
---
How: through mystic forge recipes
---
Where: at the mystic forge
---
which:  [https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards) 
---
That makes technically six sentences. So good luck, my friend ;)
---
TERA has this great feature of being able to switch instances of a map freely. But I guess for GW2 the technology isn't there yet.
---
There actually are walls hidden behind the storms. Really makes me curious what the situation was, and if we'd get similar if we jam ourselves down Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's throats. Or if they're just too tiny.
---
My issue wasn't how long it took, it was how long it took whilst being some of the worst gameplay I've experienced in a game.
---
i have 9k shards,  wheres my money?
---
GJ man! I got mine yesterday :-)
---
Yayyy!!! Now can everyone NOT get on, blast through the whole thing in one evening, and then bitch about no new content for the next 6 months please??
---
That shit is worse than spoilers, in my opinion!
---
With Science!
---
I dunno. I;d much prefer flipping burgers to staring at a spreadsheet all day.
---
Through telecommunications and time? xD
---
A huge portions of MMO players don't want to ever have to alt-tab during the game. They want to fullscreen, be immersed, and just play for a few hours then peace out. (Most will settle for the fake fullscreen so they can still check Messengers like discord, but yeah, they won't want to fiddle with a browser)
---
That's the reason. It's that simple. Not negotiable cause they're creatures of comfort, not efficiency. 
---
You not relating to it doesn't invalidate their preference because part of the aim of developers is they NEED to appeal to these players too.
---
You saying "simple bookmarks" and "simply writing it down on paper" is only an indication of lack of sympathy which doesn't solve anything.
---
Looks like Bangar will be ~~evilized~~  ice-ified.
---
I genuinely think it is fair to say that this time, there will be far less people blazing through the content and then bitching about it on reddit/forums.
---
i try to cleanse the cripple and slows in the area  bc fuck that noise
---
Malyck and the other Tree will alwys be the thing I wanted to hear about the most.
---
yep, I got 1 park at the top of the jp, but thats only 3 pearls
---
THIS is what I was talking about, not about how wrong my 'six months' comment may or may not be.
---
Hrm, I went there to test out a Spellbreaker build and practically depopulated the region of trolls and wolves, and nobody even mailed me a tip ;(
---
He's clearly not thinking about that though, there was one ad for me in the beginning and that's it. Many valid reasons to dislike the guy, but he's definitely not selling out, 90% of his videos don't even mention his patreon or have more than one ad. 
---
If he wanted to make more money it would be much smarter to have lots of 10 minute videos with an ad each or 2 hours with ads every ten minutes.
---
For trouble
---
If this prologue is all we're getting for the next 6 months, then people here have every right to complain.. 
---
Especially if all this contains is a small map and 20-minutes of story dialogue.. 
---
What Guild Wars 2 players *want* is content that keeps them engaged between releases. Like new RAIDS, new FRACTALS, new rewarding MAP METAS, new ELITE SPECS, new PVP/WVW FUNCTIONALITY. 
---
GW2 players don't want to ration out the new story steps or collection going, "Okay, these new 20 minutes of story dialogue and 10 collections steps are all I'm going to get for the next six months so I guess the Devs intended for me to play only 15 seconds of the story arc and complete only a quarter of each collection task each day."
---
GTFO of here.
---
At least this is still a treat for people who don't want to flat out their golds for griffon. 
---
And about my tone, I am sorry if you feel that way but all I ever wanted to say is please consider this lightly, since it is not that big of a deal. My 2-day example was to show that you can proportionalize this collection and set a goal for it, you don't have to use 5 toons to grind it like I did, but 5 toons for 2-day grind, meaning if you are sticking to one toon to farm, you can calculate how long it would take. 
---
Complaint about grinding all you want, there are tons of other things to do, yes, but sometimes if you feel like chilling out just head over to any ss4 maps, do the heart and mine the resources. I have been playing lots of grind-fes so I feel absolutely comfortable with it, and I also clarified that it may just be me. I am nkt trying to shove my words into everyone head, I just want to tell people to take it easy and relax. 
---
And indeed, Anet won't add any content that specifically requires Skyscale, but it is still nice to have a flying mount to simplify traveling and it also makes climbing terrain a lot quicker. I would say it is nice to have, but fine without. In short, if you don't want to do it you will always have a reason not to, and I would totally understand, since my best in-game friend is still sitting on his griffon and doesn't even bother about skyscale at all. 
---
But it doesn't make farming for it is bad, since sooner of later you would farm those resources for other collection anyway. There are tons of thing to do in fame, that is why we can choose what we want to do. I am not telling anybody "hey if you grind too slow for skyscale, you are fucking garbage" It is all about taking that stress off and enjoy it. 
---
And for u, if you feel like you are too busy to grind for it then feel free not to. We are not judging anything here, and if you have your ownidea about what must be done in game (fractal farms, do some stuff with friends, crafting legendary, etc), then I guess it is normal to have my own way as well. And for me, I have never cared about functional boost in GW2 that much, just there to chill out with random people in the map, call me a peep or casual if you want to, but that is where I am at since I see no reason to go hardcore for now.
---
Dude you don't need to blast through the update to be done with most stuff in a relatively short time
---
Probably Braham, HoT launcher design *had* Rytlock
---
Someone actually got a new instance yesterday by pure luck after checking it every day! It was on EU though, so not sure if that would even fit for /u/Captn_Captain.
---
Successful people can farm winterberries without having to kill the mobs guarding the nodes.
---
Maybe that is why it takes ANET so long to release content? They use a longer calendar than the rest of us?  For all we know, to their devs, it is still early in 2018....
---
Or maybe we could get Taimi because...well...she might not have much time left (??  =(  )
---
Now THATS innovative marketing.
---
To preface, I tend to agree that it's not a great idea for Anet to charge for new spec classes when they are alone... but I'm not entirely against it either.. 
---
My case and point on this is Necromancer in Diablo 3.... I have never heard anyone call that release a P2W class. What exactly makes such a thing bad in GW2 when it isn't in other games? Is it the presence of the gemstore in general? (D3 doesn't have micro transactions.)
---
This is Bangar tho, no?
---
The devs did confirm in a Guild Chat that it had been at least multiple days since Aurene died
---
He is ;)
---
if only the real world worked that way.
---
PvP will finally make money for Anet
---
Correct, this one is Bangar, but probably they will use Braham instead
---
Well done , but personally I cannot be arsed. I took one look at the relentless monotony of many of the collections a few weeks back and gave up. And i'm someone who has:
---
The entire Funerary collections armor and weapon ( before the increase in mosaics)
---
Mawdrey
---
The Wayfarer's Henge backpack
---
Inquest backpack collection.
---
So i'm not exactly lazy.
---
&gt; But that doesn't mean that grind is ok in any quantity over any thing. They just went too hard on this.
---
Meh. People had it in a week. I had to grind up 250 of 4 of the currencies, and I finished it in about 2.5 weeks. I think we're just really used to anything functional being basically gifted to us. 
---
&gt; People will start using it for everything, and who doesn't get it will probabily have difficulties to do things like staying on par with a zerg.
---
We had the griffon from the release of PoF, and many people still don't have it, and yet I don't see people complaining that they're left behind because they don't have it.
---
I have all my combat buttons within 1 key from a finger.
---
I use a g502 as well which has many of my combat buttons. I also use scrolling for skill 4 and utility skill 3 (down and up respectively)
---
Something about skill 4 always feels right with scroll down, and I‚Äôll always have at least 1 instant cast that benefits from scroll-up
---
Nah, it's OK.  I'm the hero The Bitterfrost needs, not the hero it deserves.
---
At least the timegate is better tbh, but I would agree that you are more benefited from asc armor than skyscale. 
---
But hardcore is a bit oversaturated, collections like requiem or dragon blood weapons are even more of a hellgrind (F for 440 mistoniums)
---
Holos; the class that has everything except long cooldowns.
---
I'm also pretty time limited, one of my best friends just finished this and maaaaan oh man am I not looking forward to grinding so long for it -_-
---
For the consumer, not for the company.
---
Brahamnarok*
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
after 4hrs of map comp? yes.
---
So basically, the content is shit and players do not want to replay it and that is why it's good for the industry and the players that we are forced to repeat it.
---
Fuck off. Content is shit: which is why nobody wants to play it. It shouldn't be shit. And if A.Net can't do that, then maybe they should rethink this whole MMO-business thing.
---
170 (Pack Hunter)
---
Excellent meme, good sir. Now, I'm going tk need that source image from you. Thank you kindly.
---
As someone who is relatively new to GW2 (about 6mos. in), and having unlocked Raptor, Skimmer, Jackal and Springer), should I focus my next efforts on Griffon or Skyscale? From what I read, Skyscale is incredibly lengthy process. Would Griffon be "easier" (term used loosely) to acquire?
---
I don't d it for you, I do it for the claws and corrupted lodestones that they can drop.
---
Can't post to reddit without an error message
---
Is it just me who doesn't feel like spending their time after work clicking materials in a video game?
---
You mean like this?
---
&gt;like the teaser that showed what we think is Aurene's crystals now that she's a full Elder Dragon.
---
Or you mean like the 2nd and 3rd links, where it's focused entirely on the "charr party" aspect and they're nothing more than extended versions of the very first teaser. It's hard for people to read in this damn reddit.
---
lets go and craft 45 legendarys now, sell them with 500 profit each and you have the moneeehs
---
Is it just me who doesn't feel like spending their time after work clicking materials in a video game? Inb4 people using autoclickers to do it for them while at work I guess...
---
Smodur's balls!!
---
So that's why I'm seeing a thousand of the same message
---
The thing you're doing is that you're saying u/Myrorr is "talking optimal builds that are for speed clears" and you're "talking about overall numbers and pugs", yet you're comparing golem dps benchmarks with real raid situations? Yes, on golem, they may be higher, but there is stuff called mechanics in raids that tanks dps of both power and condi classes.  
---
I pug a lot and whoever is top dps changes fairly often; sometimes it's power dh, sometimes it's power weaver, other times condi renegades or power chronos, but the damage you do depends on the skill of the player and his knowledge of the encounter, not the potential of the class on the golem or if the class is power or condi.
---
For starting raids you should pick a class/elite spec that you like and then stick with that - you'll most likely invest a lot of time and money into gearing it and learning the encounters with it when starting raids so it's only logical that you pick something that you like. Luckily, as far as I know, every elite spec has at least one viable build that you can use, and some have several!
---
It still helps others, so it still counts.
---
And this is exactly the kind of post I'd call low-effort.
---
Looks awesome! Where's the leg piece from?
---
I think ppl are entitled to do whatever they want with their lives....
---
I tried it once for 15 minutes. There is a reason people don‚Äôt do it. Unless you have an auto-clicker program (which is bannable) to do it for you it is mind numbingly boring and a bazillion mouse clicks.
---
It would be havoc for a little while maybe but it would stabilize rather quickly. The main gate would still be the time investment in getting spirit shards.
---
I want less boon-stacking, more room for condition damage builds, and for stealth-stomping and other cheese to be removed.  That'd do it for me.
---
For people who don't get it:  Anet compared the Living World to game of thrones back in the day.
---
(i still dont think its very funny...)
---
Congrats!!!
---
Clearly, the person is pointing out that this is OP's "so fucking trash."
---
It is not mine, so it is instead your "so fucking trash."
---
Funny thing is that people reported all the bots killing mobs for us to farm faster...
---
Idiots are everywhere.
---
Or driving to/from work (granted my family pays for YouTube premium, so I can download videos in case I lose connection)
---
I do Shift+1 (raptor), Shift+2 (springer), Shift+3 (Skimmer), etc
---
Get celebratory boosters, exp boosters and nourishments to boost your exp gain, get a max kill streak bonus and kill ambient mobs with yellow names. Many people ignore those, and the longer the mobs have been in the world without being killed more exp they will give you. This way each mob can give you closer to 10k exp. Grinded all my HoT masteries like this on launch and it didn't take long to reach the max mastery
---
and make it double
---
Biggest issue about Marauder is that you also reduce Ferocity and Power (because it's a 4 stat). Did you mean Valkyrie maybe?
---
The idea beind the current gear of Reaper is the following
---
* [Soul Eater](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Eater) is now much better than [Decimate Defenses](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Decimate_Defenses) so you will probably want that
---
* Inside Shroud still no issue to crit cap thanks to [Death Perception](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Death_Perception) so Impact it is on one of you sets
---
* However that means you can't crit cap however you wanted outside of Shroud and GS is where you will camp out of Shroud so here is why you need that Accuracy (except in Fractals with offensive potion)
---
* You don't try to camp Shroud as long as possible (except in the oppening) you usually exit as soon as [Soul Barbs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Barbs) runs out so in Raid (or Fractals with long-ish phases)
---
* When target is below 50% you have even more interest to exit Shroud after Soul Barbs because the Gravedigger spam is very profitable
---
For endgame purposes you will pop in Shroud for the duration of a Soul Barbs and then pop out. Using Shroud as a 2nd health bar is really ok to absorb heavy hit occasionally, not damage ona regular bais, otherwise you will cut you DPS by quite a lot. So the best you do is maybe put a bit of Valkyrie on Axe+Wharhorn (usually ok/worth because you are supposed to do Axe 2 right before and after Shroud and the stuff will get you a down of Life Force (jsut be careful of the changin health pool).
---
and make
---
wait, that's supposed to be Caithe on the far left?
---
oops sorry, didn't know you were
---
Oh that would be cool
---
Oh, you're the reason I always die!
---
This game was made by a soccer mom trying to teach her kids patience, responsibility, and doing chores. no fun/ difficult quests, just collected things...because we told you to. This is not what we meant by engaging loot outside of the gemstore.
---
Imagine if there was a setting that activates something like a "bubble" around your target that cuts, makes transparent, or lowers the resolution and complexity other player's effects inside it, maybe their models too.
---
You would be able to actually see what an enemy is doing and react to it.
---
Would be nice!
---
https://youtu.be/4XTgPAEBBXI?t=54
---
Putting character model limit to lowest helps a lot with it because it allows maybe 5-10 characters and their animations in your screen.
---
You can hardly see anything because there's so much clutter from all the skills. Just look at those indicators.
---
Because it is "dying". There being new players doesn't magically change that.
---
This is why we have cross 'platform'skills and separations based on mode. They need to start utilizing it, it's like they selectively forget they built the system to be able to be split 3 ways
---
Ha, hope he got home safely, that little bugger.
---
That map chat though, ow. Poor Ayin -\_- With Dulfy gone, she's like the next best thing for achievs.
---
Set your items up in the top 4 slots, target the mystic forge so it's a priority target.  Press F, put in the stuff, hit accept, press F, repeat.  Even without an auto-clicker this is short.
---
I doubt it, but I would love it if they did that.
---
Don't worry too much on gearing, replace what you can, be on the look out for drops, and mainly just try to get proper stats selected. You can level crafting as you go (getting it to 400 is ~7 free levels too) and you'll get a couple extra pieces of gear that way (use [gw2crafts](https://gw2crafts.net/)). In general you're after berserker stats as you level (power, precision, ferocity). Once you get to max level then you can figure out what [build](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) exactly. Your greatsword 5 is CC, 4 is a block (that switches to damage and CC if it blocks in melee), you'll get better at timing blocks and dodges as you go on just be aware that they exist.
---
The guide is pretty much general tips and tricks but if there is anything missing just let me know and I'll add it in, I have a lot of play time on ranger too so feel free to ask about specifics on it.
---
Yea sure thing its that or because the cluttering of skills is awful...
---
I've actually just recorded a sub 20 min video of me doing one set of conversion as a tutorial for players that join the discord.
---
usually they are on walfare, thats why they prefer games like gw2 where they cna convert ingame gold to store currency.
---
I don't know why, but I expected the teasers to get longer and more informative throughout the week, rather than shorter and less
---
Wait isnt it obvious? White walkers, dragons, swords on fire, the commander gets ressurrected
---
praise megaservers
---
Yup! I can't kill all of them by myself, so this is a somewhat malicious way of getting help, too.
---
Still the coolest character, tho. Even if I had no idea who she was at the start of HoT, or why everyone kept calling me Commander
---
The part I like best is the cc and add management. 95% of the wipes I see are caused by leaving one of the shields up going into a burn phase.
---
Your first mistake was expecting something.
---
bet you are the type to complain about pocket raptors too.
---
No it doesn't.  A high rate of turnover is not sustainable in both games and real life jobs.  GW2 has a high turnover rate at the moment meaning a lot of veterans are leaving and are being replaced by new players.  What's happening is the players that make 3rd party content, guides, builds etc. are leaving and taking their knowledge and expertise with them.  Eventually, most or all will be gone and the game will consist only of very new players.  This is not good for the health of the game.  It might be OK for the company's short term profits but that's about it.
---
Just like in real life, when you have a company that has a high turnover rate their short term profits may increase because newer people cost less to employ but eventually the lack of expertise costs the company is market competitiveness and knowledge which will lead to a huge problem.
---
What Anet is doing is very indicative of a business strategy aimed at turning a quick profit.  If they wanted the game to be healthy for a long time they would focus on veteran players.  Veteran players bring people into the game, make the game visible to others through websites and social media etc.  Veteran players provide builds and guides to get new players started thus lowering the barrier of entry.  Providing for newer players is jokingly easy and requires little effort, which is probably why they are doing it.
---
Wait isnt it obvious? White walkers, dragons, swords on fire, the commander gets ressurrected. I guess im the uncultured one? xd?
---
Oh man, this is endlessly tragic.
---
Anet added it recently, means "deprecated content".
---
This is your opinion and not actual fact. A commitment to ongoing content support is not a way of earning short term gains. Quite the opposite.
---
My guess is that it's easy to make humans the focus of the plot
---
I made a 2019 meme just for you.

There's a German book by Erich K√§stner called "the 35th may", a day full of crazy stuff happening. Also changing both numbers looks less photoshopped than just one

I thought that it would unlock cursor once you opened any menu, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, I've only used it with a toggle hotkey, since it's the best way to get full control out of it. I have it set to middle mouse click.

It simply says "Lions Arch Aerodrome"

It says LION'S ARCH AERODROME.
---
Lol
---
I think it's written "Lions Arch Aerodrome"
---
It says Lions Arch Aerodrome.
---
We have similar feature?
---
That's a seriously random thing to say... unless you had inside information! A new launcher would make sense if it was an expansion launch. And yes, I know ANET has said that Living World can do "anything an expansion can do". In any case, I would welcome a change of scenery for sure.
---
The last step was not hard. The first collections were far more difficult and lengthy.

First of all: wvw community want balance but they have no idea what exactly. They just have a balance.

There are people online 24/7 on the EU servers , idk how it is on the NA side  .
---
Well i once made an application for myself that pinged api for current prices of mats, and according to given recipes calculated income from buy order and sell order.
---
The app made a chart and analyzed when to buy the items (because they're cheapest) and when to sell the output item (most expensive).
---
Never made so much gold in a day. But sadly ANet changed something in the API and i don't have time to fix the app :P

[The inevitable 5th panel.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Enriched_Compost)
---
Ah, thanks for the information! :D
---
I think they are banking on the fact that the people they need to start generating more stuff and get involved in the community will be vastly smaller than the people that don't. They need more of both. Buyers and producers.
---
I get 15g in 20 mins by logging in and collecting stuff, can be done without setup at all. You're just being delusional or you just want anet to send you legendaries via email.
---
I don't really understand this subreddit. You want to bring new players. They even want to play the game, but they are not sure if the game is worth playing. And you guys down vote a topic that is meant to show that the game is fine. Guh.
---
Actually, the pocket raptors complain about *me*.
---
I've gotten letters.
---
&gt;This is your opinion and not actual fact.
---
And everything you've said is.....?
---
Missed opportunity for having Soon be on the 9, 12, and 3.
---
Yup. I love in the world of reality. You guys live in a world of ‚Äúpoor us‚Äù
---
So basically setting video speed to 2x? :P
---
I assume you could buy an item on TP, destroy it with BLSK, then sell rune/sigil from it at higher price than the item.
---
I just went through your post history and you seem to be a very sad person. I suggest you take a break and play another game for a while.
---
No it wouldn't. There being a couple of new players won't suddenly mean hundreds or even thousands left.
---
WoW peaked above 10 million and it reached numbers so low that Blizzard stopped mentioning them, do you think WoW is perfectly fine and NOT dying?
---
"Romans, they go house."
---
&gt;I live in the world of reality
---
Clearly not.
---
FFS. Games peak in popularity and decline. That doesn't mean they're "dying", it means they reach an equilibrium population where the number of people entering is equal to the number of people leaving. GW2 has a very low barrier to entry and can easily retain people due to having no sub fee (so even if you get bored, you can just stop playing for a bit and then come back when new content comes out) so it will naturally have a reasonably high number of people entering the game, always. Even if many people leave, the game can still stay healthy and continue on in roughly the same fashion because many people are starting (or returning).
---
So no, just because lots of people leave, doesn't mean the game is dying. People have been predicting the game's death since it was 6 months old. It's still here, the world is bigger than ever, there is more content than ever, and we're still getting new stuff. Not dead, not dying, just changing.
---
The guy above you literally told you what happens in reality lol

Nah, jk. Excited for more Norn stuff. Hopefully some more viking inspired gear!

---
I use action camera exclusively due to issues with nerve damage. It hasn't been an issue for PvE* and I've used the camera mode since the release of the first raid up until now, completing all CMs without issues due to my camera choice.
---
*minor note - it doesn't work for certain abilities that require a target and LoS on the last 10% phase of Dhuum. I use normal camera then.
---
Nonsense. First, not all veterans are leaving. Second, knowledge is transferable. This is a game, not rocket science. Institutional knowledge is not going to be lost because some raiders left the game, other people can always watch videos and learn to raid whenever they want because it's a \*\*game\*\* and it is designed for people to learn how to do it. 
---
You're greatly over-valuing the importance that "veteran status" has. We were all noobs once. We ran stupid 4 warrior 1 mesmer builds in CoF. We survived, and so did the game. If all of a sudden, every veteran stopped playing the game, the newbies would still be able to learn and do the content on their own, just like we did years ago. 
---
But they'll never be alone, because they'll always have youtube guides and such from the past 7 years, and the game will never actually fully lose all its veterans.
---
Don¬¥t get your hopes up, season 5 is still linked to PoF soo the could keep the character screen and character selection
---
Anyone expecting some secret 5 minute way to make massive gold is going to be disappointed. Understanding the economy is what makes these guys able to make so much money and it's never instant.
---
Romani ite domum
---
Well, if you don't want negative interactions, don't trade, and if you need it for some reason, and even if it's as simple as giving food to someone mid raid, it's a useful feature. For the f2p part, can just not let f2p accounts trade, but it really shouldn't be an issue
---
Am I the only one bothered by the first two coffins pointing the other direction compared to the last picture?
---
I wonder what the most efficient would be to be #1 on the achievement ladder.
---
I did a lot of conversions when cooking came out to make lodestones, made the juggernaut, made Verderach, made clovers for a legendary sigil, then I started converting stuff for gold, converted t5s to t6s for the two legendaries and all that was maybe 1000 shards

Yeah, why do anything ever. Fuck A-Net for making me play their lousy game!

because that is a bannable offence
---
How can I get 3 more chak egg sacs in shortest time possible?
---
I can play roughly 5 hours daily and have everything available to me
---
I sure hope so!
---
If I could do it in gw1 to get the drunk title, I'm sure it can easily be set up in gw2. It's just a clicker after all.
---
Yeah, the 1 skill is a bad way to do it. That skill forces you into a dive even without the flap. It's harder to break out of it than just pressing the dive button which is default V. Not to mention that if you're too close to any terrain that skill will dismount you as you will reach enough height near the ground to activate the attack.
---
Probably not.
---
I was under the impression that the devs have said exp isn't wasted, but instead directed to a hidden spirit shard track that then cashes out when you finish all the masteries (except hidden ones) whenever that is?
---
I didn't even say what I do. Keep blaming the system :d
---
I still remember the very first character select screen. A ruined Ascalon, a camp and camp fire and a maximum of 4 characters standing around it. Selecting one to play before hitting the play button would have them step forward.
---
Wicked cliffhanger
---
Doesn't really justify a collection that takes close to 8 hours (with guides!) and multiple daily time gates.
---
Hell, it took me 8 hours of playtime and I paid the money in treats to skip every jumping puzzle / world boss.
---
A macro script will have the exact same millisecond delay between each keypress(unless you make the delay random) and that's super easy to pick up by anti cheat algorithms.
---
The video was largely unuseful for me. This is what I got from the video if you were fortunate enough not to watch the whole thing.
---
The major points that I took away from it were:
---
* Crafting and selling legendaries is very profitable and a way of converting spirit shards and gifts of exploration into gold.
---
* The other way of converting spirit shards to make gold is to convert t5 mats into t6 mats
---
* The wealthiest players have networks of people willing to buy legendaries for gold
---
* The average player does not craft legendaries to sell to other people
---
I think it says, "nothing's off the table"
---
HoT came out 4 years ago and the change occurred before that. If you've been screwed by anything it would be by your own lack of attention.
---
Obtain every kind of account unlock, including achievements, skins, wardrobe, an anything else that can be unlocked once forever for the entire account, and do everything once with every character, and eventually have 1 character of each profession for each playable race, including tengu.
---
My goal is to have all 69 slots filled with lvl 80 characters, all with individual background story, unique look, different builds and ascedent equipment. I'm currently at No. 34
---
Im starting to think we might have different definitions of what ego constitutes. I gave this person an objective answer to his observation based only on the limited, emotionally charged information he provided. I deal with a lot of negativity on a daily basis for choosing to play tempest and DH. Personal attacks via whispers and mails come to me like bills, and thats fine, my block list just keeps growing bigger but my games more enjoyable.
---
Finding a new game that has devs that actually listen to the playerbase and provides repeatable content on a regular basis
---
Hahaha this is so odd and great
---
You're asking for a recap of four years worth of changes and updates. 
---
Start at level 1. Play the game.
---
That would be an amazing April Fool's Day feature.
---
Assuming you're talking aboot power DH, the rotation comes down to using your hard hitting skills while your damage modifiers are active. The damage modifiers mainly being the f1 skill (through big game hunting trait) and the boon Retaliation (through the radiance trait line). The heavy hitting skills being focus 5, scepter 2, GS 4, GS 2, and procession of blades (trap). GS 5 is also an incredibly hard hitting skill if adds are near and you use it inside the bosses hit box.
---
Lets home they at least home some content tomorrow to back up all this marketing.
---
Hey some people are way behind and still want playable Tengu.
---
Goal is ascended gear, followed by t4 fractals and then getting into raids. I have 2 hours of playtime a day and finished t1 fractals. Hot, pof, lws2, 3, 4 owned.Did lws2, currently working on HoT, have the raptor mount already(Did the first mission of pof to get a mount). 50 ish gold on me currently xD. Got a fractal ascended berserker ring and a berserker ascended amulet, the rest is exotic berserker gear. My character is a warrior.
---
I was being sarcastic, didn't think I need the /s.
---
Elite specs change up the way the game is played. Thus far they've only come in expansions. People who play the game more hard core, want to change how they play, they want new metas, new builds, new ways to approach content they've mastered on other specs. So they want elite specs.
---
Anet said they would give expansion type content in Season 5, which many took to mean elite specs.  When the announcement came with no mention of elite specs, people were at the very least disappointed. Some were furious. 
---
Anet hasn't said elite specs are off the table but I don't think any are being worked on right now.
---
To a lot of people, not having new elite specs in the game is a game changer. Note. I am not one of those people.
---
&gt; How can I get 3 more chak egg sacs in shortest time possible?
---
opening 3 bonus goods boxes very fast (and being lucky)
---
I should also add Im only really interested in pve, dont really care about pvp, wvw...
---
All we know is that she has a real life job she is focusing on
---
I can tell you,  you're not missing out on the beetle, its a niche mount.
---
I don't have griffom, but it seems pretty niche too.
---
The skyscale on the other hand is a massive qol improvement if you do any sort of mapping or spend any amount of time in HoT maps. Its so bloody useful.
---
You don't have to grinf it tho. It took me a  month, playing only 1 hour a day. If you're not in a rush, it's not that bad...and I pretty much only use the skyscale now.
---
Thanks for the explanation, yeah I personally wouldn't mind another set of elite specs too, but since I also still play the core classes I don't mind too much. Still looking forward to the new content
---
i'm not going to watch, but i've seen these types of pitches before and the general gist of 'converting spirit shards' always seems to be "do something that takes a ton of time / a millions clicks, but happens to use spirit shards in the process, and then divide the total profit by number of spirit shards used and say that spirit shards now have x gold value". 
---
is that still the case here?
---
it's sort of like assigning a dollar value to "turning your wrist counterclockwise" because in order to get a paycheck from your job you must unscrew the gas cap of your car to put gas in it, open several doorknobs along the way, etc. when in normal situations both wrist turns and spirit shards are basically worthless money-wise but simply a prerequisite to performing the unrelated function. the only time they matter is if you're completely out or have need of such large volume you can afford to pay others for *their* efforts (which happen to include wrist turns or spirit shards but are still primarily just time)
---
Of course I want a new set of elite specs. I just don't see this as a deal breaker for me personally, one way or another.
---
Since cooking does, yes I guess?
---
This game *actively encourages* you to play in all levels of zones, including the starter ones. Take a look at any of the collections; you'll see quests &amp; tokens that require you to visit a variety of lower level maps, talk to npcs that maybe you skipped over, etc. The game is working as intended.   
---
I do realize that some people prefer end game content to be radically different from earlier game. I personally like that guild wars tries to integrate the veterans &amp; the newbies sometimes.
---
But, the Griffin mount collection was long too! This collection was just purposefully protracted
---
I do because it sucks
---
just report everyone not moving anywhere because [portable mystic forge is a thing.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_Conduit)
---
Episode 1 comes out: ‚ÄúAnet said episode 2 would be the meat of the season‚Äù.... and the cycle continue.
---
Yeah, let's just wait and see what we get, I hope it's nice. And I personally like the charr and norn, so I think I'll like it
---
Just sweep the dust under the rug, no one will notice.
---
It's an economy. Give &amp; take, buy &amp; sell. Gotta have people participating or it all grinds to a halt
---
Love this response.
---
I mean we've had this theme for about two years now....
---
Good Luck o7
---
My goal is to have 90 characters on one account. Have waited 7 years, so timeframe hmmm, maybe 2 more years? Kthx.
---
What happend? Pls tell me ur story why u can't play.
---
https://imgflip.com/i/3aqcmi
---
Get out!
---
You are right 100% of veterans are not leaving.  I guess the couple of veterans still chugging make up for the large number that have left /s.
---
And it's not just raiders.  It's WvW players, PvP players and Raiders.  Some open world farming vets might be around so that's good?
---
Yes, we were all noobs once and same with real life the "veterans" there didn't have the knowledge from day 1 and learned it.  But guess what?  When you have a lopsided ratio of veterans to newbies the transfer of knowledge is very minimal.  This means all that knowledge gained over the years is lost.  Yes, there are youtube guides just like there are textbooks but there will be less and less people to transfer the "tribal" knowledge or to fill in the gaps.
---
You say I am over-valuing the importance of vets but you are saying the exact opposite; saying them leaving doesn't matter.  History has shown keeping veterans around is beneficial.  Show me 1 online multiplayer game that survives with zero veterans and a constant turnover.  I couldn't find any myself.
---
I dont expect it, but it would be a great step to signal to people that we really are beyond the "borders" of POF and entering a new phase of the game's life
---
EVERY hero wears butt capes
---
Christ.
---
And I thought I was a depressive piece of shit.
---
I spit out some quickness and harvest before they notice me, then i run off OUT of stealth like a baller
---
You thought Faolain was  good villain? I'm on the other side of that coin. She had absolutely no presence after the book and that one story mode dungeon.
---
All HoT maps are always full when it‚Äôs Meta Time.
---
I have a feeling we are going to have a lot of people who are going to seriously misunderstand that video.
---
You have to take this video a lot like the people on YouTube who tell you the secret of their real world success was in stocks, investments, real estate, etc. The tips they tell you do work, but it's no get rich quick scheme.
---
These guys optimized their gold gain to the extent that they look at EXP as part of their farming route. They don't even consider gold the goal, just cause there's no practical way for them to turn everything they have into gold without destroying the market for a little bit. They deal with a lot of item and material trades instead of gold, which is why they use "x million in deals".
---
Simply having shards isn't enough. You need the rest of the everything else to make great use out of it. Even if you just wanted to be someone who spends your shards for their gold, you will need a lot of time and a lot of shards to be able to make crazy amounts of money from them.
---
The easiest way to look at this, is using spirit shards and extreme efficiency to make legendaries for as cheaply as possible. This is just far beyond most people's scope. It requires a whole new view on the concept of what gold is as a whole. What every currency and material is actually worth. Using everything in the game to minimize your cost, to maximize your profit.
---
You aren't missing out on as much as you think. Most people just aren't this level of dedicated, and I expect a big part of this video was to get more people interested in selling their spirit shards as a half way point. What everyone needs to understand is, it's not a quick way to make money. You'll be spending a lot of time clicking items at the mystic forge to make money off them, and without the efficiency they have when it comes to gathering mats, it's not exactly just something you can jump into solo to start making big bucks.
---
In the end, don't worry about it that much.
---
I think you can expect something like bloodstone fen: not as big as the latest episodes but still worth your time
---
I'm getting a lot of ice and fire vibes from this shit. Reminds me of Season 1.
---
Why all the hate on Ayin?! Yeah, she has an accent so fuck her right? She's doing all the work you lazy fucks won't do.
---
I have a full orange berserker set on my warrior other than my back slot. But my other class has pretty lack luster gear. That being said I have about 170 gold I can burn if I need to.
---
Well i can recomand you r/Guildwars2 thats a good one
---
That depends on what you actually want to do with crafting because it's not necessary for the most part. Pvp can already supply you with gear and some gold which are enough for wvw.
---
So you can easily cleave a group of mobs but can't dodge through an aoe? That's very weird...
---
We don't know but I think so. The real question will be how fast the episodes come after. let's say we get 25% of the content normally in a episode but get new content every 2-3 weeks (I know way too optimistic) it won't be so bad but if the content is less and the wait time will be the same that will be terrible. I'm also quite skeptical the way they are handling the marketing. It can go two ways. Either we will be blown away with the amount of stuff in the patch or there's barely anything in it.
---
Ma'jaunty sir.
---
Ok then
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_Shard  
---
Does it really look like as if it is difficult to get spirit shards?
---
What do you mean soulbeast with pets? I thought you should merge with your pet to gain new f1-3 skills and that the point of the spec ._. x/wh is axe and warhorn? I like this combo! Yes, thanks I'll really buy/craft some berserker orange stuff, only thing I don't know how to get is a backpack. Sure I could grind winterberries for ascended one but I have better thing to do XD.
---
The biggest tip I can give is how to search for any item/skill/location on the wiki from in-game.  Just type "/wiki " in chat, type your search term -or- Shift+Left-Click the item/skill/POI, then press enter.
---
Focus on damaging stats on your gear:  
---
Power/Precision/Ferocity if your skills/traits just do straight damage  
---
Condition Damage/Expertise if your skills/traits do damage-over-time (Bleeding/Poison/Burning/etc.)

I used to be like you. Clearing a path where-ever I went. But then one day I got a reaper glyph. Now, I can plop down, use my consortium scythe ONCE, and be remounted before the mobs can even get a hit. Now, I am the selfish asshole.

---
The roller beetle? WTF. Takes maximum 3 hours. Easiest of all Mount collections. 
---
And if you don‚Äôt like things that take time, the whole genre is wrong for you. 
---
And that you want everything available for real money - ... - How is it rewarding to own something you just bought? It‚Äôs just boring. Imagine you could just buy everything and be done with the game.
---
Yes, anyone expecting more than this will be disappointed, and no doubt they'll be over the place complaining. It's called a prologue for a reason.
---
That's the natural effect of supply and demand for ya?
---
What about the jerks that fly in when you're killing them, loot the node and fuck off without helping you....
---
&gt;I mean, there's nothing to prevent a player from doing that.
---
Nobody ever said there was. The point wasn't whether they *could,* the point was that they *should.* The point was that rather than recruiting peons to work the lobby, these guys should be inviting everyone up to the penthouse level. 
---
&gt;That's one of the main points of the video - to avoid the TP as much as possible. 
---
But in this case, either their TP alternatives should be open for everyone to use, or they should be putting the pressure on ANet to open up those alternatives more broadly. If their method is seriously much more profitable than the methods ANet designed into the game, then either A. ANet should shut them down as unfair competition, as they would do if a PvP build was vastly outperforming others, or B. ANet should make the process more clear and available to casuals, so that everyone profits from it. 
---
&gt;There's also the possibility that the person doing the grunt work doesn't want to actually do the things necessary to produce the final product (legendaries). They can still make money from this process as a middle man. Your argument is basically "Why do middle men exist? Why not go to the source?"
---
If one person can manage the efforts of multiple other players, then it stands to reason that each of those players could do their portion of his role themselves. Why **do** middle men exist? Why *not* go to the source?
---
&gt;The ones doing the grunt work and selling their shards are the medium effort workers. The top dogs are putting in max effort and they are telling you straight up that if you don't want to do max effort, there is still money to be made at a lower level.
---
If that were true, I wouldn't have a problem with it. The problem is that it's rather "The ones doing the grunt work and selling their shards are the **max** effort workers. The top dogs are putting in **medium** effort and they are telling you straight up that if you don't want to do medium effort, there is still money to be made at a lower level, but they also won't tell you what you'd need to know to do the medium effort stuff, just that it exists."
---
"You farm for three hours, give it to me and you can make 60% of what that effort could be worth, rather than the 40% you would be earning normally. I would be making the other 40% of what that effort is worth, and doing the same for dozens of other players, raking in hundreds of times what any of you make from the work that you do." 
---
That is not a fair system that works to the benefit of the average player.
---
Amazing information thanks.
---
Welcome to GW 2 where kp's are made up, and the skill don't matter
---
Would you say that it's... unberrybly rude?
---
what an ironic response
---
there's a lot of the same scenes, but very few of the same shots. blind fool indeed.
---
This is me too. When doing it on multiple characters, I would need to do 'optimized runs'. Avoiding all mobs at all cost, evasion, stealth..etc. so I can remount as soon as possible to get to next node.
---
Let's hope they get repurposed as Strike missions
---
THIS ID WHAT I DO! haha! I look at their boons and trying to keep them up as they burn through all my stability and aegis like it's fucking tissue paper.
---
Also these groups get feared my arks eye often which is just fucked.
---
But isn't survivabilty way better with HB? I also played druid a lot but I like HB way more in fractals, so much more reliable for everthing. But yeah some people facetank a lot but I usually can handle it unless some of the instabs are really bad. I've never had people blame me though for not having stab/aegis on some points. What variant do you use on the CM's? The radiance variant or virtues?
---
I like the premise of the joke and it's kind of inspired me to think of a few ideas. I love the idea of an alien trying to figure out "MMO culture". The AFK thing was a good start, but I would have taken it even further. Imagine him trying to understand a zerg rushing past, people jumping like psychopaths, random danceathons, incredibly toxic arguments, logging off, and the naked guy. I would love to see more.
---
&gt; If that were true, I wouldn't have a problem with it. The problem is that it's rather "The ones doing the grunt work and selling their shards are the max effort workers.

---
&gt; That is not a fair system that works to the benefit of the average player.

I mean, did you even watch the video? They talked to one guy who joined a meta train one of the leaders was organizing. The leader (top dog) explained the value of shards, etc and what they were doing. the new guy started by selling a Map Complete or shards or something, and then decided to go whole hog and do the whole chain thing the top dogs were doing. 
---
The leaders want more people to get involved - they are doing the max effort of meta trains for XP/shards. They have streamlined and organized these runs for max gain. They talk about their process during the run. They are doing the max effort of organization and community building while doing the same work they pay others to do. They are there farming the same hours as everyone else, thus demonstrably NOT medium effort. The ones who join their meta runs, hear about this and decide to use an existing community to sell their resources and go no further are the ones putting in medium effort.
---
If all is as they describe it, they seem very transparent and eager to teach people to do what they do. The more people involved, the more opportunity there is for everyone involved. I don't discount the possibility that they have other secrets they don't share, but we're not discussing that. We're discussing what was put out there publicly.
---
By your logic, why sell anything that isn't worth 100% of your resources? Because other things factor in. Maybe you don't have enough capital to do the whole process and need a first step to get started. You need money right now and don't have material goods (wood, ore) to sell. You don't like running dungeons to get the tokens for the gifts, so you won't be doing the whole process anyway, so this is a piece you can take advantage of. It's more convenient to do a few conversions once in a while while you watch Netflix than committing fully. There are lots of reasons this might appeal to someone.
---
I just don't get why you're so determined to tear this down.
---
Yes we do know, they said it was a "mini" episode, or at least compared to season 4.
---
Yes I do this too.
---
Nothing infuriates me more than those douchenozzles who hang out near a nose cluster, then wait for someone to engage then dive in, get the berries, and leave while the first guy is still fighting.
---
I've occasionally broken off my route to head them off, get the mobs to spawn, then head back to keep fighting/harvesting with the good guys.

&gt; If you do you will be upset and feel that you did not get what you wanted or expected.
---
Well I'm expecting a map full of minigames that will get old after the first few times, so my expectations aren't very high.
---
Merging with pet is optional and can be temporary. It's not permanent. Winterberry farming takes like 5 minutes per character anyway.
---
You can have both damage and sustain with slb, but on druid it's just sustain that comes with a huge damage loss considering that it has no offensive traits and no offensive skills in CA. It's not something you want in solo play and generally it's not something you need either.
---
i cannot unsee this
---
Said someone on the discord.
---
In my experience about 70-80% of groups desperate for boon-supports like FB/Ren have awful damage anyway.  I tend to avoid LFG's where there isn't at least one boon-support to begin with as part of the initial group pre-LFG post.  I'd say that lower KP groups tend to be more motivated, but at the cost of being players of questionable quality.  I think it's more difficult to gamble on 30 ess/LNHB than it was last year. 
---
I've definitely noticed that the "average DPS" player is *helpless* without aegis/stability for every major mechanic.  It was sickening to see someone get feared by almost every medusa-eye/fear.  I tend to be pretty patient, but when groups are prematurely nova-launching, lack awareness for when they do/don't have stability, or if an anomaly is dying?  These days I draw the line at failing one of the 80/50/30 tower phases because it speaks volumes about how people handle pressure. 
---
I joined another generic 100cm run this past week; maybe 2 to 2.5 hours total for the clear.  We had an experienced DH carrying damage, a Weaver, a Reaper, a Druid and me on various support classes; mostly Firebrand.  They significantly improved their nova launch timing over the course of the run.  The DH/Weaver were replaced with DH/h.FB and I swapped to Holosmith and did anomalies and we killed Arkk within about 40 minutes or so.
---
I play HB and have gotten a few of those people. My go to responses are to either point out deadly instabs, like out flanked followed by some kinda witty punchline about not dying. For the players that expect me to cover everything for them 100% of the time I let them know I cant out heal stupid.... like walking into skorvalds hit box on the last phase, or running away from mama with outflanked on and getting destroyed, only so much stupid a support player can cover for.
---
After these reused teasers I can say that it will. This is the first time we had prologue so far so I am guessing it will have less content.
---
And the fleshing they could have done, too. The nightmare court want to explore the full spectrum of emotions and they're obsessed with it, that's why they torture their new recruits, to show them the unpleasantness, too. After they're zombiefied they wouldn't genuinely feel anything, so they should have been the most vehemently idealogically opposed to becoming minions. I was kind of expecting a higher number of court survivors/resistors among sylvari, which would push the racism levelled at sylvari in the expansion further.
---
Instead, we got Tree-Faolin.
---
*And the expansion, too.*
---
No
---
Yeah, exactly. This works very well and it is easy to manage. Try it out and you might find you no longer have a need for anet's build templates. Though it does beg the question why  a modder can do it and they haven't been able to for years.
---
&gt; Also these groups get feared my arks eye often which is just fucked.
---
.... i take the fb elite for just that reason. I shouldnt have to but I would rather see that hp drop then them run away from the boss and not have the jump for the ball.
---
[Goya had a pretty good idea for them.](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQVZqRbMt3Kx_lzsS597F_t58nywTqAWBZohr6Cnpsptv4XwnyI)  But only because I couldn't find the one where satan was eating them whole, and then shitting them out to be eaten again.

     Philosopher Stones (spirit shards) + Pile of X Dust + 250 Material + 1 Better Material

Works for metal, wood, cloth, leather, blood, totems, scales, fangs, claws, bones, and poison sacs e.g. Copper Ore to Iron Ore. This can also be done with elemental stones e.g. Charged Core to Charged Loadstone. See [Material Promotion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge/Material_Promotion)  for all the recipes.
---
[gw2efficiency Spirit Shards](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards) lists the most profitable for the Current Market Value. Skip recipes for equipment and trinkets since they require TP Baron levels of waiting and investment. Also note that just because it currently isn't profitable doesn't mean it's useful. E.g. Thick Leather to Hardened Leather is only a gain of .5 gold but do you really want to muck about with the TP or farming to get Hardened Leather?
---
arguing arround a single topic won't bring you far.  
---
easy fix: be friendly and ask that the ticket gets escalted to the next higher gm and don't argue arround.
---
This is the result of the "kill proof" system.
---
The toxic raid mentality has corrupted fractals (more relaxed content), and we have to deal with that.
---
So we see developers that try to invite new players with always new content but when they grow, they find a wall in the content that could please the most, and we lose people. But apparently this is not a problem.
---
Carry on
---
They will come long before wvw alliances.. üôÑ
---
How do you get a easier gylph?
---
You are correct.
---
I mean asking for the dates is suspicious and tbh no way any reputable company will give it to you. They do ban waves because of this, if they say "We caught you between X and Y" you now know that particular hack/exploit/cheat is detectable and you can narrow it down or tweak it. If you ban 50,000 bots every week in a giant clump then it becomes much harder to figure it out.
---
Monstrum delivering the character experience we deserve, but can't have given the restraints of the MMORPG medium. I'm sure this is how Anet wishes they could tell the story, but can't, because the Commander is 5,000,000 different people.
---
if anything the people that don't know that the tonic costs 90 ess are the ones that don't have enough experience doing cms, since they literally don't know that you can only buy 2 things with it and what they are. they obviously have no idea what they are doing
---
Likely.
---
&gt; I mean, did you even watch the video? They talked to one guy who joined a meta train one of the leaders was organizing. The leader (top dog) explained the value of shards, etc and what they were doing. the new guy started by selling a Map Complete or shards or something, and then decided to go whole hog and do the whole chain thing the top dogs were doing. 
---
The video did not explain "the whole chain." They deliberately avoided "the whole chain." It was not a "teach a man how to fish" video, it was a "teach a man that fishing is a thing you can do" video. 
---
&gt;The leaders want more people to get involved - they are doing the max effort of meta trains for XP/shards. T
---
But the "max effort of meta trains for XP/Shards part **is not the part that makes money.** That is the part that makes the raw resources *they* need so that *they* can make money. It is the miners going into the coal mines every day. We don't need to learn that step. The step we need to learn is the "how do I take the shards I do have, turn them into the *most* profitable step that can possibly be gained with those shards, and then sell those items off at that tier." 
---
&gt;If all is as they describe it, they seem very transparent and eager to teach people to do what they do.
---
And yet they had a two hour video that are glaringly absent in the actual "teaching how to do the things they do" part. 
---
&gt;Maybe you don't have enough capital to do the whole process and need a first step to get started. 
---
But if I *do* have that capital, then all I'm lacking is the knowledge of what to do with that capital. They did not provide the knowledge of what to do with that capital. I would not fault them in the least if they laid out the entire plan and then said "now you'll need 5000g to get started on this, if you don't have that much then we have a plan B that can get you that far," but no, they didn't do that, they just left out the "here's what you do with capital" portion entirely. 
---
If there are multiple reasons why the full plan might not appeal to every player, that's fine, list ALL the options, let players choose for *themselves* which of those options works for their time and interests, rather than just assuming that Plan A wouldn't work for them, "so here's plan B where I also make money off of you."
---
&gt;I just don't get why you're so determined to tear this down.
---
Because it's a scheme designed to make money off of other players' work, and I don't believe players should be making money off of other players.
---
It's not because not every group is like this. In fact, most groups arent like this. People usually leave before complaining. The bad ones are usually the loudest and that has nothing to do with raids, you can find those players everywhere.
---
Just wanted to point out some misinformation here, a set is not 1,400 mystic forge conversions. :P
---
I am not telling you to not play the game, I can only recommend it. But if the rollerbeetle is to much to do for you, there is literally nothing with less effort in this game. It‚Äôs a really small and easy collection. If you like story that is great, and I personally think that even if you only like the story that is still reason enough to play Guild Wars 2.

Those mobs are like the old, naked guy in Life of Brian. So protective over their berry bushes!
---
I never knew just how horrifying the Snake Trap actually was. Holy fuck.
---
I think it's only a Ranger using Utility Skill: Viper's Nest. But each theyr own.
---
i meant cm fractals  because both suffer the "i dont have kp therefor i cant gain kp" paradox issue. i already have 51 li at this point so i can be accepted to most groups and it only took me 3 weeks, so i do agree its not as hard as people (including myself) make it seem to be. TIL.
---
Uhhhhh how about let us use tool belt skills after overheating that would be an ok start
---
&gt;It's fine to have some things that aren't a cake-walk
---
He didn't say it was hard.
---
my level 80 berries-slave thief can never thank those enough.
---
üëÄ so... actually I didn‚Äôt look too deeply into the beetle . Once I saw a series of collection quests I didn‚Äôt bother to read much further. I understand why it has to be this way, because of the time it takes to create story content. But I just don‚Äôt like it. 
---
I was also concerned when I read you would need max masteries for the future DLC content to get around ( not sure if this is true) . 
---
At any rate , have no fear. Once I‚Äôm able I‚Äôll be buying the next expansion and every one after that. GW2 is great memories üòé
---
It‚Äôs a new map but all I‚Äôve seen from teasers seem to be mini games....wonder if this something done by the festival teams maybe but it isn‚Äôt actually a festival.
---
At least we know there is some story regarding rytlock and his tribune
---
PvP bot?
---
&gt;At one point, the guys did say he wishes there was more time to explain things,
---
But also there were several points where they were like "we could say. . . but no, we won't."
---
&gt; If you were able to talk to these guys one on one and they didn't give you all the info they use, then I would probably agree with you.
---
They had plenty of time to go over more of the actual plan, that was never their intention. If they want to put out a second video, I'll watch that one too, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
In theory, given that prologues tend to be short by nature (but they could be longer than or as long as a chapter).
---
In practice, all we can say is that it won't be of the same nature of releases. Episodes 1 and 2 will share a single map, while Bound by Blood will have its own map.
---
The issue is that they rebranded Season 5 as "The Icebrood Saga" with a prologue and 1) Living World episodes never had a non-festival prologue before (the only prologue had before was Festival of the Four Winds 2014 acting as a prologue / teaser for Season 2 Episode 1, where it showcased Aerin joining the Zephyrites, and had proto-Dragon's Watch mention going west after the celebrations/fundraising). And 2) We don't know what the rebranding means, whether it's just a special name for Season 5 (e.g., how Season 1 is "Scarlet's War") or if they're changing the Season methodology, or Saga is more than a Season and will go beyond our current season.
---
Regarding the masteries they said the they will use certain mastery-bound mechanics into the new Living Story, like Gliding or Jumping Mushrooms or Mounts. But I doubt that you have to have masteries maxed. I think the basics, like the first few masteries of the mastery trees will be enough.
---
Except now it's just a "prologue" after 4 months.
---
Did they? I only remember them saying it was a prologue. When / where did they say it was a mini episode?
---
You might notice that nowhere did they actually claim you were active the exact second the ban was enforced. The GM was merely repeating the obvious: that your account was online when the action flagging it for a ban occurred, and that they won't provide information on when that was for security purposes.
---
Before I do a general reply to your comment let me just debunk a few things. First off the red and blue infusions are both Lucky drops but only the red one can be purchased from the vendor with essence.
---
second I did not say that this was a recurring thing or that this happens all the time. I'm just talkin about a problem that I have been dealing with for the past few months that have just bottled up. If I had to take a guess maybe about 526 * this is happened in this time frame. I have had plenty of successful groups but with ones requiring 100 essence or more I've been at a probably one success out of those groups. So 1/6.
---
Thirdly I never in my entire time learning fractals teaching fractals I've never blamed anyone else but myself. As toxic thinking that it's someone else's fault why you lost is just a horrible way of well... Thinking.
---
Fourth I never implied anyting. other than probably vagueness of what I wrote could be interpreted I never outright gave statistics.
---
I do appreciate what you said but a lot of what you're saying is just jumping platforms that I've never confirmed or said.
---
also I should know that I am driving right now so as far as reading completely what you wrote I could have misinterpreted things and I'm also using voice to text so hopefully I reply correctly
---
&gt; ...have an easier time of unlocking the griffon...
---
Well that‚Äôs great news ! Looking forward to the next pack. Maybe I‚Äôll grind for a week to get the ‚Äòscale. I grinded (ground?) for a week to get a weapon in Destiny 2 after all. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Wow, that's even more underwhelming.
