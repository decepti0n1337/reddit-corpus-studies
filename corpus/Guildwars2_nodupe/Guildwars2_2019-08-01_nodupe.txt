Exactly, criticism, not bashing. I've made that point over and over again.
---

---
Ask yourself these questions, do you enjoy the game in its current state? Did you enjoy the game in previous states? What specifically do you enjoy? What specifically do you not enjoy? For the things you don't enjoy, what about them do you not like (ie why don;t you like them), and what could you suggest to improve the game?
---
Actually use some brain cells instead of crapping on a game with a single word. If your side of things is to get new GW2 players to play GW1, then offer up some of the better things the game does, most people are gonna dismiss you if you don't offer at least a little insight into the game. Think for once.

To be fair the title says "late"!

The rigging is not the only reason, but it really is true even if you don't want to believe Skyy-High. If you've ever taken a look at ripped texture sheets you can see that armor and outfits do things **completely** **differently** which provides advantages to outfits. Allow me to explain:  
---
  
---
[Here's an armor texture](http://i.imgur.com/po2fALF.jpg) (Note: I didn't make this image - the person who did incorrectly guessed that the area at the bottom is for the backpack. It's actually for a naked torso.)  
---
Note how there are specific areas for individual armor pieces, and also the character itself, all crammed into a single texture. Those specific areas never change dimensions or location. The artist has to work within those tiny areas and get the best resolution out of it that they can. A boot can *only* be in the boot area, and even if you don't want to include gloves for some reason, you cannot use the gloves area to add more space for the boot texture.  
---
Also, there's a different set of designated areas on texture sheets for other armor weights so even if the meshes *could* line up, which they absolutely cannot, the textures wouldn't be in the same spot on the sheet, making it unusable.  
---
Meanwhile, over in outfit land, about 50% of the sheet is a free for all. I can't find a visual example at the moment but if you want to see one I can get one when I get home. This open season on texture real estate allows the artist to have the boots take up as much space as they want. And it doesn't end there. Because the gear doesn't have to mix and match with other gear, they can have one continuous texture spanning the length of the body. This allows them to have design elements that cross the areas where there would normally be armor seams. Armor cannot do this. Armor seams have to end nicely on that cut so they don't look like you just took a pair of scissors to it.  
---
And I'm sure there's even more to it that I'm not aware of.
---
Its not that it competes with the infusion because it doesn't, its just straight up better than the infusion. The infusion is like trying to stargaze with a glass covered in mud, meanwhile the outfit is stargazing through an actual quality telescope.

They keep making legendary (raid) armor easier, first the conversion system with li's &lt;-&gt;ld's, now the provisioner tokens too.
---
It sucks and I'm aware of it, but it's easier for me to not care about the outfit being BLC-exclusive because I don't want it.
---
Speak for yourself...
---
still have gw 1 installed, i log it up once or twice a year for a few minutes
---
FYI OP, late game update notes are when they forget to mention something from the previous patch. This is a new build with bug fixes.

First post was old notes, sorry. They posted these notes a lot later.
---
Is this a complaint thread complaining about other complaints threads not complaining about a specific complaint?
---
no one has alt and not enough token to power up immediatly to 80 . 
---
new players do not care about that
---
I'll note it next time.
---
I've spent more hours in this game than I cared to admit.
---
My sincerest apologies!
---
TIL : costumes in Guild Wars 2 are " high - end content " . /s
---
The hardest is probably the expert one in jahai, near the settlement, especially if there's a rift there.  (friggin tree).  Took me forever, when I got the master one in 2 tries Funny story: when I did the expert one in CD, I didn't know how to do the speed boost dive.  So I got gold on it, without it.
---
Well, be fair, those aren’t new either :)
---
If you need help, there are many videos on YouTube showing you how to beat every single adventure. They are a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. 
---
Also, make sure you have all the masteries unlocked and know all your key bindings!
---
"outfit power creep"
---
People really complaining that the art team did too good of a job lmao.
---
Mounts are nice but it's generally not recommended to use a booster on your first character, but rather to train it yourself. You learn a lot doing so. Using it on a second character is just as rewarding. If you do use it, you'll need to start the PoF story missions as said in the thread.
---
'support' has more meanings than 'hold it afloat with my wealth' though.
---
Then again we do have a terrible mentality of 'every little bit count' as we can see with global warming propaganda (propaganda refering to ideas like where *you* may prevent global warming by showering only once per week because everyone may decide to do the same and it would be effective to solve the issue). In that sense yes, claiming to support the game seems unsound.
---
Alright. Are mounts account wide? If i unlock one on a lvl 80 can i use it on a new character?
---
Its DEFINITELY more noticeable now, and it feels like this is the time where anet has to make the decision to accept losing the pvp/wvw portion of their playerbase, or give us a reason to actually keep investing our time in their game, especially as content creators such as yourself move on from the game. My friends and I would frequently think itd get bettet next patch, or they have something in the works, but id be very surprised if anyone in the pvp/wvw community has the smallest inkling of that thought anymore, especially after warclaw release. The living story livestream while were still in the dark about pvp/wvw entirely doesnt help.
---
"look at how many people on GW2 efficiency have completed the last two raid wings vs how many have unlocked gemstore skins"
---
How does that factor into cosmetics being p2w, like at all. People have to be into raiding content to justify having cool cosmetics?
---
No, you shouldn't use the boosters.
---
My suggestion is to Level your ranger to 80 normally. Then start the mission 1 of POF. Get the raptor, then quit the story. 
---
The raptor will make it easier to get everywhere. Loads easier. Leveling to 80 without using a boost will help you learn to play. Don't use the boost unless you're going to boost a brand new alt character.
---
Correct!
---
This^ don't use a boost on your first toon, save them for a 2nd or 3rd toon so you can spend your first character learning the game.
---
OP you are already level 50 so getting to 80 will go quickly. Using an 80 boost is essentially a waste unless you're using it on a fresh brand new alt character
---
And then we never heard from /u/Zyhm again...
---
F
---
&gt; Even LI/KP is making me think twice now, "did that guy really do 100 bosses or was it just 1k mystic coins/$$$". 
---
or chatcode ...
---
finish your ranger normally and make another class using the booster after all you aren't too far off from 80 anyway on the ranger. That way you can have 2 option rather than the one ya know.
---
&gt;this game is not trash.
---
CTRL+F "trash"
---
This is literally the only post that comes up 🤔🤔🤔
---
These people live off the nostalgia. Gw2 could be the best fucking game ever made and these people would still moan that it's no Gw1. 
---
This is extremely rampant in any long running thing. Games, books, music bands, what have you. There's no arguing with them because their arguments never go anywhere deeper than "they changed it and now it sucks."
---
We did it people, Anet finally added Power Creep to Cosmetics. I don't know if the action or the outcry is more ridiculous.
---
Good, let it be insulting. They started running their own game in the ground the second they gave the excuse "not enough time" for anything. Outfits, RNG BLC items, Auras for everything, A shit economy... I would rather the game close and all the devs move on to something else because it is a steaming pile of garbage now from how it has been managed. I would feel proud of my work for the game but be ashamed to be a part of fucked up business practices. "But devs need to get paid to" yeah, I get that, but as a Dev there is morality in the uses of your work and from the looks of things, some devs agree with their awful business model because they are still there and still working. So no, I do not care about insulting the devs on this one because they are choosing to not talk about it/losing their job over disagreeing with it.
---
Same thing is happening with the OCX of NA servers, Commanders and whole guilds are tapping out. It's not looking good for wvw.
---
Is it already active? I have like 30 keys I'll blast em all when I get home from work...
---
&gt;This is the exact mindset that caused the Starborn outfit to be a gambling only cosmetic.
---
&gt;And if this works, they'll keep doing it; 
---
They already did it with an outfit: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fallen_Balthazar_Package  
---
(and a lot of other items)
---
The items were later available for Black Lion Statuettes, the Black Lion Exclusives Chest, Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock, other unlockers...
---
&gt;Meanwhile, no new expansion just another living story. Why release an expansion that you can profit off of while making a huge advertising fanfare for your game and giving everyone a new reason to play with new elite specs.
---
* Don't complain before LWS5 is even out
---
* ArenaNet likely thought about it very hard and did an analysis to decide that LWS5 would be a better idea than another expansion
---
* We don't know if there won't be elite specs
---
* They have announced that there will be features that one would normal expect from an expansion
---
 * Though predictably this won't be as many *at once*, it will be spread out over time.
---
* We don't know if it will be free like LWS4
---
&gt;add in a new mount which requires players to run around the world doing over a hundred asinine tasks which overlap on eachother but you can't do it all at once you have to go back to the same place three times for three different sets of chores
---
Yeah, "screw ArenaNet for adding encouraging replaying old content, adding a storyline to a fully voice-acted collection, and adding more gold sinks". Yes, collections may not really be content, but some variety is nice. You only have to do it once, and the Skyscale is arguably far more useful than the Roller Beetle.
---
&gt;This also happened in Runescape.
---
That has been part of RuneScape's reward system for over 10 years now.
---
&gt;Maybe the new announcement coming up will be for elite specializations in the next living story. It's still a living story though, which means it's almost guaranteed to be free. Which means they're going to have to keep finding other ways to profit that don't involve actually adding real content to the game. So they're still not going to be properly supporting themselves and will keep releasing cosmetics instead to do it. Maybe they're actually profiting more off the cosmetics then they would from a real expansion, it's not unlikely considering the Starborn outfit will potentially cost the price of an expansion to get.
---
wait why did you write the previous paragraphs with such malice if your intent was to actually be sensible and constructive
---
&gt;There's zero reason for them to release a gambling locked cosmetic when they already have a cash shop; unless they're blatantly trying to force more money out of their playerbase in exchange for the same amount of effort.
---
It's OK; you can get it later; chill. Might be cheaper to gamble for it, though! 
---
&gt;And if it works, they'll keep doing it until it replaces the gem shop.
---
\&gt;unironically considering this as a possibility
---
An update dropped minutes before your post. Did you install it?
---
so...for some of us, about 3 hours of work...meh
---
This is how I play. Removes all the dragons from the skies and makes everyone that does render ride a default mount. Wish you could set it to prioritize rendering enemies over players though.
---
All valid arguments. Let's see how fast your post gets inundated with downvotes from PvE'ers and white knights defending Anet saying this like this: "oh but WvW has gotten LOTS of content updates, like mounts and no downstate weekend! Toxic WvW players btw, complain when there's no content and complain when there is content, can never please them"; or maybe my comment will get deleted first for "causing drama" since this reddit became forums V2.0 because people like to pretend everything is fine and dandy in this game. 
---
Nah but for real, this latest "balance" update became the last straw for the few of us who are still playing. Chrono got deleted, 15% sic'em nerf is apparently sufficient in the eyes of the balance team, and bugs with condi thief and continuum split are still not fixed 1 week after the patch. I can go on and on about what they should do to improve the game mode but in the end it's all wasted effort, just like your post. People will still play WvW/PvP purely for the love of the combat but don't expect it to improve; indeed, it only goes downhill from here. 
---
Oh and, alliances btw ;) If Anet weren't so greedy server linkings is what alliances should've been from the start, but they make plenty of $ from the server transfers every link (just look how every top server in T1 has had a link since the start of server linkings) from bandwagoners that there's no point improving the game. Anet is probably laughing at WvW players for still funding a 7 year unsupported game mode (sad truth).
---
Ex-PvP player here. I feel like you hit it on the head quite well. Like I use to fucking love PvP in this game. Back in the day when hammer guard was a meme, till that one guy used it in some tournament and it became like the sickest build to run for awhile. I use to play for hours on end just solo queing hammer guard. God that was so fun. Some of my fondest memories in this game was in PvP, like playing these jank builds like right hand strength guard with sword/focus + scepter/shield (this was before burn guard). It was fun and it was interactive. But then Anet lost the faith of a lot of PvP players back during the early days of HoT. The Pip system they introduced was so blatantly idiotic anyone with any sense of reason could see the abuse coming 10 miles away.
---
That aside the direction of PvP was kind of telegraphed during the pre-HoT trait rework... the one that killed turret engi (thank god), but introduced the new flavor of gameplay: players vs passives. The problem became glaringly obvious when the ol' chrono bunker build that was rampant during that phase of PvP. They nuked that build too... but that was only the most prominent example. Elixir engi would survive for quite awhile longer until newer and newer cancer builds would come in each balance patch replacing the old ones that Anet had 're-balanced'. It's a problem with Anet's class design. GW2 PvP is the most un-interactive PvP game I've played in awhile.
---
I'm thinking it's a bug from the latest patch, just logged in myself [got the same](https://imgur.com/z2dhjOP), no server selection
---
I have the same problem and the same build number. This is not a new toon and the current world has HOD
---
Glad it's not just me. I sent diagnostics to support so maybe this will get resolved or we find out if it's a bug with the update.
---
Assuming this is directed at me - I noted above that I've bought plenty of outfits, not to mention quite a few mount skins and other stuff. I'm not exactly coming at this from some kind of entitled "everything should be given to me for free" position. I've sunk enough money into this game to qualify as at least a dolphin if not a whale.
---
And it's beside my point, anyway.  Whether you agree with the need for transmutation charges to exist or not, ANet deliberately created a system where they blocked something off and added a paywall. This is a situation *they created* - it was *harder* to implement in the game than just letting you change your skins as many times as you want. It's not some kind of engine limitation, or being easier to do, or one of the other more reasonable excuses for outfits (which, as I noted above - I am fine with for the most part). Hence my point that the existence of transmutation charges is not a good reason for outfits to get preferential treatment, and doesn't belong on the list with the actually valid reasons.
---
As a PvX player, at all levels, I liked the high end PvE it was fun, until there was nothing left. WvW I love the gamemode, and still do, but after years with the lack of anything and the noticeable decline of population, I am also mostly sick of it. PvP don't get me started... I'm actually more saddened at the fact that Anet doesn't seem to understand their own classes than I am at actually having a balanced game.
---
At this point, it is the sheer disappointment of what Guild Wars 2 is compared to what it could have been. It is the wasted potential that it SHOULD have been. Guild Wars 2 has kept me here only because of the potential that it could have been, at least in my opinion a MMO that truly outshines the rest. Yet, with years of hardly any change this hope has dwindled into extinction, at some point enough is enough and it's time to cut your losses and move on..
---
This popped into my head after killing subject 7 in down state lol.
---
I only see a man with a moustache.
---
In this thread. I was railing against the general sentiment in a LOT of the hot threads in the sub.
---
not sure 5000 gold is worth 6 inventory slots in his case....
---
For me it's the entire Sovereign weapon set and it's upgraded version, which requires I do the dailies consistently!
---
Guild wars 1 was amazing!  Guild Wars 2 is my favorite mmo of all time and though.
---
Lol 5 figures!?
---
What's more ethical than "You don't need any of this shit to enjoy the game"?
---
The Loch ness monster
---
A lot of people complaining about lack of content come from all aspects of the game. If you're a pvper, wvw player then there hasn't been real content in years, and if you're a raider then w7 isn't enough to satisfy you for the next 9 months. Also legendary runes isn't really content because to get the gold to craft them you have to just grind old content. I can see why casual and story focused players would be happy with the game's current state, but if you look from the perspective of any other community the game doesn't have much new stuff to offer.
---
coughanetwhiteknightcough
---
Absolutely, I just wish Guildwars 2 integrated a progression system like WoW. Having obtained 13 legendary weapons and legendary armor, i find myself coming and going in GW2, but I always see myself back. No matter what :)
---
(Lots of us have other people’s models turned off anyway lol 😄)
---
how many mount skins are earnable in game?  Yep, big fat zero
---
Youre such a tool.
---
Because most of those people rather just sit in an empty map spamming join on a IP that is full rather than join the new LFG listing.
---
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/build always shows last one
---
Aside from Balthazar's outfit, items like the elemental sword, and the wild magic glider were also put behind RNG, I believe at this point people aren't talking about it because it's been repeated numerous time, and it's something Anet isn't budging on, despite the terrible community reaction to it.
---
To make room on my desk shelf I recently boxed up all my physical pc games since everything is digital now. Couldn't bring myself to pack up the GW1 boxes, they stay on the shelf.
---
You are basing this assumption on the fact that the game is currently in a transional period between two seasons. Much like the space between expansions. You dont know what is coming.
---
The leap of "graphical fidelity" from old celestial infusions to this is definitely not a jump significant enough to cause this. It's definitely just money or laziness.
---
I responded.  I am interested in the results if you post them.
---
This story made me so sad. GW2 is by no means the worst example, but so many games are built to convince people to spend extra on vanity goods. I would be more than willing to pay a subscription if it meant people weren't acting this way.
---
I know this feel, my dude.  I was just going on a nostalgia trip the other day about my thousands of hours spent in GW1 and it's expansions
---
You seem to be under the impression that this is new behavior for them. It isn't. Every single game company in the world has to make the choice to drop stuff they want to do in favor of stuff they have to do. Not doing those "have to do" things is what kills the game, not outfits, not RNG BLC items, not auras, not even a shit economy. Fixing tiny stuff instead of making big stuff is how you kill a game.
---
I'm not gonna object to anything besides the fact that you were listening to Justin Timberlake when the game came with one of the best soundtracks of all time.
---
I suspect that we're getting two Living World seasons between expansions because, well...
---
Core had Seasons 1 and 2 before HoT. There wasn't a lot of direction with S1, but it handled 'what happens after Zhaitan".
---
Heart of Thorns required The Great Rework that resulted in a content drought instead of what should have been a Post-HoT Season 3... but we DID get a sort of 'mini-season' through the Current Events.
---
Season 3 ends up being a rushed, but amazingly high-quality denoument of Heart of Thorns, and lead-in to Path of Fire.
---
So far, Path of Fire and Season 4 sort of ape the release cycle of WoW and FFXIV: Path of Fire 'proper' was just the First Act, and denoument of Season 3 - Defeating Balthazar, much like how FFXIV's Heavensward expansion set the scene for the conclusion of the Dragonsong War, but 'ended' at the halfway point, with the overthrow of the Church. It wasn't until later in the patch cycle that they got to finish the fight. Likewise, Season 4 has been about Finishing the Fight set up with Path of Fire - Overthrowing Joko, and then neutralizing Kralkatorrik, with a bit of set-up for Season 5.
---
I suspect Season 5 is going to be a lead-up to Expansion Pack 3.
---
Thanks, I just checked it out today too and yeah no update yet. That's strange, I haven't encountered any crashes so far.
---
Many things yes, but I'll say one exception is Dark Souls for some reason.  Most people seem to prefer 3 and hate 2 even though all three are equally great (but different) in my eyes.
---
&gt;literally makes the cost of it like $50 
---
This is only about 1000 gold; 1600 at most.
---
Post the clip
---
If GW2 stops bringing in revenue, it stops being developed and the servers get turned off. I don't know their financials, but I don't think they cover costs with buy to play expacs.
---
I took a Business Ethics class while I was studying in college. It basically boils down to this question... are you giving it your best effort to make money for the shareholders or owners of the company you work for without breaking any laws that may get them in trouble? If yes, then it’s ethical.
---
I don’t think it’s right, per se, but there it is. And you know enough people are okay with paying $50 for the Starbound Outfit that Anet feels vindicated for selling it at hat amount or by sticking it in a loot box.
---
because there are far way too many things you can do to exploit it, for spite.
---
anet would never put in place means to restrict other players for playing their content, like you suggest.
---
too many ifs, for starters. 
---
what if you accidentally block someone? what if you really like to block people, and more often than not, maybe youre the one overreacting and then blocking the person? how would that be fair to the other players? 
---
sooner than youd think, nobody would be able to join anyone, because theres a very high likelyhood that everyone is on atleast someones blocklist.
---
if theres one thing people like to abuse and overuse in this game, its the block function. they block for the silliest of reasons, and sometimes for or no reason at all.
---
and most of them have the set-and-forget attitude, meaning they will never unblock people.
---
my suggestion is that you only want people not in your blocklist to join, set up a private party consisting only of your friends and stay off the LFG.
---
I think your ethics class was deficient.
---
The worst part about this survey is that it made me go through all my receipts.
---
I don't know how you have the patience to get all of those legendaries. I got my twilight and that's all I have patience for. Haha
---
Btw... Are you excited for WoW classic? I am!!! For the horde!!!!
---
I'm using the real world value because the real world value is A) the way they (Anet) want you to buy it, and B) MUCH more cost effective in terms of time spent than the "in game gold to gems conversion" value.  Assuming 50 consistent gold per hour (pretty damn high) that's 20 hours worth of work.  Even 5 hours worth of work at a minimum wage job in my state will get you enough money to get enough statuette's to get the outfit far sooner.  With a better job it's like 2 to 3 hours and a good job 1 or less.  It's pretty not worth to convert gold to gems for this.  
---
Also who spends 1000 to 1600 gold on an outfit??  crazy
---
Business Ethics is about the philosophy of business and the purpose of a company. If the purpose of a company is to maximize profits for shareholders, then sacrificing profits for other concerns is a violation of the company’s fiduciary responsibility. That is what is unethical.
---
I was so happy to get twilight as well. It was my first and only legendary weapon.  After the grind I just didn't have it in me to go for another one. Lol. 
---
Man I am hyped about wow classic.  I only played wow back in 2005-2006 so this is pure nostalgia for me.  
---
I played Warcraft 2 battle.net edition and Warcraft 3 and my main race was always orc so I am a horde guy lol. I played as a orc shaman back in wow as well.  
---
This time around after I am done making my orc warrior I would like to make a night elf rogue just to experience the alliance zones :). The best things I love about guild wars 2 and wow... Is the amazing PvP! So ready.
---
Gem store, barbie doll dress up props aren't content. 
---
Those posts are hilarious.
---
Thought this was gonna be about the humpbacks doing janky 180 degree turns. That's not how whales work.
---
You're only promoting the gemstore with all these posts, wouldnt be surprised this has spiked sales even more.
---
What's happening on the 30th?
---
The trick to getting a higher score has always been switching from the skimmer to the raptor or any other faster mount. I just removed the skimmer from the equation entirely :3 easier said than done.
---
You make some valid points when it comes to the game, but everything you've said about mtx here is complete bullshit. 
---
"other games are worse" "they've been doing it for 10 years already" "it's fine if they make everything gated behind mtx because they give you free spins(fucking ***really***?)"
---
These arguments make no sense. Just because *it could be worse* doesn't mean it isn't already terrible as it is right now.
---
Sure thing. Welcome to the game!
---
The builds i listed are for players that have both expansions unfortunately. Elite specializations are just better than their core counterparts, not to say that the core classes aren't fun or strong, but you will have to swap a trait line or two to make them work at their peak.
---
That's super bizarre.
---
They didn't even have an expansion based model between Aug 2012-Jan 2015. The first expansion didn't come out until the game was over 3 years old. The second one came out just under 2 years after the first, and we're not yet to 2 years since that.
---
If they do another living world season (which they are), and it takes 6 episodes again, and an expansion comes out after that, then we're on track to having the expansion in another ~1.5 years.
---
Nothing about that is out of line with what they've done previously. The only thing different this time is 2 living world seasons back to back, and that implies nothing about expansions or content to come.
---
There's literally no pattern to ANet's releases aside from their goal of content coming out every 3-4 months. It's a constantly moving target. For all we know Living World Season 5 will launch in tandem with the next expansion and you won't be able to finish the expansion prior to finishing LS5, or LS5 and xpac 3 are released in tandem but unrelated story-wise (just some examples of things they haven't done yet).
---
I did this with the character name 'Teacup' on first day of early access.
---
Ended up just making an Asuran ranger.
---
The wiki has most of the information you will need, for everything else you can just Youtube it.
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
Thats if Anet decide to allow you to get it another way, for now it is allowing Anet to put int $100-$200 skins behind the RNG wall by simply making it a non existent drop from the BLC, wait you see in the future, want that legendary you gotta get this special drop from BLC's.
---
Both these game modes are one of the major reasons I lost all faith in ANet. Gw2 is a great game that is being managed by the wrong hands..
---
Quited the game a month and half ago give pr take to go back to League and now the new TFT and boi what a dream would be to see this game on Riot hands. Yes Riot isnt the perfect game company, far from it and League isnt the perfect online game, but man do they know what they want to do with their games and stick with it.. if it doesnt work, rework it till it does or admit thwy fuck up and go back (new rank system this season for example, which was a disaster but they went back, but at least they do something.
---
Imagine a world where gw2 would get balance patches every 2 weeks.. heck every month would be already a fking wet dream
---
Yeah.. I aint coming back to this shit whole unless for story shit that for sure.. getting my hopes up after the lay off was sure a mistake
---
Yeah, many people AFK in SMC and Keep, only coming out to defend when an intruder tags it. And they can spend whole afternoons doing that... Mi no understand.
---
&gt; how many mount skins are earnable in game?
---
I bought all my mount skins from gold-&gt;gem exchange and I earned the gold ingame. I would call that "earnable in game".
---
So the answer to your question is simply: All of them.
---
In a game with a sub you can earn everything in game? And they STILL have a cash shop. And you think that's brag worthy? Sorry mate, sub games don't get to have a better cash shop than games without subs and brag about it.
---
Ok that is impressive, how many attempts did that take to get that.
---
I took Sensali, ready for Tengu as playable. Yeaaaa.
---
&gt; you do realize that the Starborn Outfit "being available via statuettes later" literally makes the cost of it like $50 (assuming you get only 1 statuette each time from each chest) right?
---
You get 1-5 keys for *free*. So in the end you will have enough statuettes (more or less) as soon as the outfit becomes availabe via statuettes. For $0.

https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013206754-Promotional-Item-Guild-Wars-2-Heroic-Edition
---
There's no harm in redeeming both, the heroic edition doesn't really get you anything super important though
---
Yeap. In business it's always harder to raise the price (In this case keep it the same) than to lower it (I.E give you more for the same amount).
---
I can't stand these "wait a week" surveys.
---
There are easy ways to make these update with live results. Having to wait a week to see them always kills the reach of these things and leaves you with a small sample size that will have forgotten about the whole thing in a week. I'm engaged enough to comment here and I can guarantee in a week I'll have long forgotten this post exists. 
---
Then since only a handful actually responded because they were the only ones willing to give you some of their free time to fill out a form they will see no data from for at least a week, the post in a week that has the tiny dataset stands a good chance of not getting enough traction to make it out of the "new" tab, and most of the people responding to it will likely have no idea you posted it.
---
Warrior wants Weaponsmithing and Armorsmithing. You will want them later on for making ascended and legendary gear for fractals and raids.
---
So, having a simple game with no server costs, gm costs, and only a single dev means the cost to keep running is incredibly low. Plus, releasing on consoles required additional work. It doesn't port itself, those are actually different versions of the game.
---
Yes, all of those things can provide revenue, but they very likely don't provide enough profit to pay for a 100+ person dev team, a QA team, server maintenence, and shareholder dividends. Keep in mind that physical products don't provide much profit because they have to be made and shipped and stored and everyone along the way wants a cut, and even if you cut out the retailer part of the chain, you still have manufacturing, storage, fulfillment, shipping, refunds, defects, etc. That chain is built to be enough revenue to appease shareholders on its own risk, not to support a whole endeavor, and ncsoft isn't in the business of physical goods, so they would likely just charge some other toy company royalties to make it, like they probably are on the new leggings. Hey, maybe it will give some more revenue if they expand, but I wouldn't expect it to reduce the burden enough to get rid of the cash shop.
---
Now, if this were a &lt;5 person dev team making a 2D mmo, maybe sales on each platform could be sustainable as long as they kept releasing *paid* content or charged $60/copy or charged monthly fees.
---
Awesome, thank you. I couldn't seem to find that page in my quick Google search.
---
Wait. I'm switching to my GW2 redditor char that's socially accepted in this sub..

---
Crafting has three uses:
---
1. If you want the super gear you can only get through crafting. 
---
2. If you want to skip a few hearts while leveling.
---
3. Selling gear to people leveling.
---
Otherwise sell the mats.
---
Have you played the other raids?
---
I've been playing on and off since launch but I came back with my wife about two years ago. We only started raiding last year and W7 feels off even to us...
---
Strange reply. 
---
Crafting is useful in many ways. Primarily, it is useful for creating ascended gear and weapons. However, there is also simple gold to be made, each day, with certain crafts at high level. 
---
So no, “sell the mats” is not good advice.
---
I am not sure what argument you are making, but Anet is not doing tiny stuff OR big stuff and that is a huge problem.
---
As I mentioned in another post, what are we supposed to do in WvW?  Even after this alliance update comes out, winning won't mean anything.  The coverage issue will be fixed and we will have more activity across all hours of the day but from what they've told us, that's it.
---
The meta is so bad, fights are over in 30 seconds.  Power creep is so bad that if you even run a non-meta spec, you'll get kicked from any squad actually trying to win.  PPT is pointless.  Rewards...what are those?  Winning match-ups?  Why?  Don't have the warclaw, good luck not getting ganked!  Wanna roam?  Nope, nearly every class can 1 shot you now.
---
I hate to say it but if you're still hopeful WvW is going to be cured/fixed, you haven't been paying attention for the past 6 years.  Its a casual game mode that hardcore players took too seriously and to heart.  That's on us.  Enjoy the memes before everyone else quits.
---
24 hours, 730 hours, 8760 hours  
---
It can go both ways, I believe that present day is more important than present month
---
Don't worry I'm married ! :)
---
The cost to make a cash store item is almost nothing, relatively. Especially when compared to the amount of assets that go into making a game. Even at $2 for a mount skin they would be making massive profits on one.
---
One mount skin can cost as much as 2/3 of *a whole expansion*.
---
The greed is insane.
---
I miss when games were RP fantasy instead of MOBA comics or BR shooters.
---
Its not your fault.  There are so many WvW players that don't have legendary weapons because they can't stand PvE.  Map completion for example is so far out of the question.  That on top of not earning any gold makes it very hard to even buy one if you wanted to.  Trust me, WvW players would rather you find a way to get the gift of battle quicker too so they could get more people in to actually play the mode.
---
Mixing and matching is unbelievably overrated, and with the amount of clipping in the game, very few combinations actually work. Most armor only looks good as a full set. So outfits are just better looking armor sets that have even less clipping and are completely free to switch between. There's hardly any point to armor skins anymore, outfits are just better in every way.
---
It wasn't really a shock when an ex-dev said there was no real direction for Anet in the past two years.  You can see it.  Its been such a shame to see.  They have to blow people away next month with whatever they are announcing or else they really do need to look into a new game/GW3.
---
It feels kind of like telling you to jump right into the deep end, considering that you're a brand new player and all, but the way to get the most value from that Heroic Edition key would probably be to not use it on your account -- buying an expansion will get you upgraded to a full, unrestricted account anyways.
---
Instead, you could create a new, second account and use the Heroic Edition key there. That would immediately upgrade this second account to a full paid account as well, giving you access to daily login rewards (most notably Mystic Coins and laurels) that you can shuttle over to your main account.
---
Using the Heroic Edition key on your main account would only get you the promo items, of which only the legacy armor set choice is worth anything.
---
Downed necro = yet another health bar, lifesteal and decent condi.
---
I believe that we have tonnes of celestial based day/night things already, second to purple crystals. Can't we get something else for a change? (BUT If they make cosmic cloak that is a window into the cosmos whilst fluttering behind you, I'll forgive them)
---
&gt;Primarily, it is useful for creating ascended gear and weapons. However, there is also simple gold to be made, each day, with certain crafts at high level.
---
You wrote the same thing I did while disagreeing with it. Classic Redditing there.
---
Actually it's 1-endless keys, because only one has a weekly restriction. Of course it highly depends on how hard you farm, I think 2-3 is easily doable weekly. 
---
I was talking about the story -&gt; key farming (and a bit more). 
---
Sources are:
---
- Lvl 10 story (the only one restricted weekly, all others can be farmed as much as you want.
---
- Lvl 40 story
---
- Lvl 60 story
---
- LS2 Story "Tangled Paths"
---
- HoT Story "Roots of Terror"
---
Imo the lvl 10 (ofc), lvl 40 and LS2 stories are the easiest and fastest ones and (the 3 I mentioned above). Lvl 60 and HoT need more lvl up books and also the HoT one need a bunch of more story to do, but you get some other reward as well. 
---
However, if you have enough lvl up books (or other scrolls) you also can get your farming char to lvl 80 and do map completion at least on Blodstone Fen, Silverwastes and Dry Top to get more chances of BLC keys. Those three are the fastest maps. 
---
So all in all, you can get many BLC keys ~~for free~~ by playing the game -&gt; without spending money, but the three I mentioned above are worth to be called "for free", because it's nearly no effort to get them.
---
From  what I've seen its all of them.
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game. I can help you get a mount even if you're under level 80. Account name Vayne.8563
---
Didn't Anet market WvW and PvP as a huge selling point in 2012? Weren't they supposed to get in the E-Sports scene?
---
There's a bit to your complaint that confuses me....it takes about 5 minutes to take a T3 if it's undefended, and if it's defended......aren't 'fights with defenders' what we all want?
---
T1 siege upgrades are....what, chill fog/supply drop and hardened gates/sabotage depot? Those are extremely powerful? Did you mean to say T3? (Which has, uh, autoturrets, too!)
---
Not saying that I don't understand your complaints, (ahhh stealth) but I'm not entirely sure what you want with the siege gameplay honestly. Defense has been nerfed a fair bit over the past two years. It's easier to take structures than it's been for a while now, and harder to just sit there and turtle.
---
You went from reasonable to “just change the everything!”
---
First point I agree with. Second has no UI and would likely need a lot of work to implement. Third and fourth are likely not happening as it would require the alteration of a freshly created asset.
---
There's quite a big difference between the games. In poe, the character's are much smaller and  except for quest hubs you can play entirely solo (which most do), which means the visual effects are far less distracting than in GW2.  I find GW2 skins are far less consistent with theme and setting. People play RPGs to live a fantasy, unfortunately for many that fantasy doesn't include the many derpy players with butterfly wings and Quaggan backpacks.
---
yah that one i just did dailies for a bit and used the reward track exp pots, sometimes even having youtube vid up while capping middle sections of the map just to up keep  hahahaha
---
Ayin is the new dulfy I guess. She has great videos if you prefer those. I usually get some kind of weird formatting on her website that misaligns paragraphs which is very annoying. Not sure if it’s my browser or on her end.
---
The last thing GW2 needs is more visually noisy cosmetics.
---
:)
---
Too many. The checkpoints are far lower then they appear so you really need to "skim" the ground to check them. That and the harbor is a nightmare with tons of players lagging you out + trying to make it through a thin route while also having the right speed and height to go under the bridge but not splash into the water
---
Row Row, Fight the POWAH!
---
It can be at times,but I like to considerate it the turn my brain off and chill activity of the day.
---
I still do some fractals but I’d rather get gold so I don’t have to pay out pocket money for nice skins when I want it.
---
So you're not gonna add anything constructive then? Seems you're the only tool here.
---
It's just what I've seen people whining about. 1 is probably needed the most, and 2 would be phenomenal if it was implemented. Personally 3 and especially 4 we could go without. I can understand the gripes with the diaper but I don't think it's as much of a priority. As for point 4, I've seen people wanting a separate armor set - so an identical one with the skin effect turned off.
---
Again, not easy. But "simple" solutions.
---
Most of the time you don't get a real fight - if you're lucky you'll draw a zerg, if not you get to just sit in siege for 20 minutes trying to out heal their arrow carts and wait until they run out of supply to repair, and then once you break in the defends will just run away :\
---
Unless you have an account, you're not going to be able to look at it. So I'll explain.
---
Because the cash shop *does* have a metric ton of stuff in it (454 separate shop entries) across various categories, the shop has lots of different buttons for the different categories.
---
**Story Skip/Level Boost items** each have their own categories. If you want to start the latest content *right now*, you actually need to buy both. Otherwise you just buy one and only get the effects of that (like buying only a Level Boost and then still having to play your way through the whole story). They're a little expensive (USD $50 for both), but Yoshi-P actually discourages people from using them.
---
**Fantasias** have their own category, entirely because they sell them in packages of 1/3/5. (Fantasias let you change race/gender/appearance options other that can't be changed with the free ingame hair/face paint/tattoo/etc changer.)
---
**Mounts and Minions** (minis) each get their own category - some of these are ones that never came to the game itself, but those that could be earned from seasonal/special events of previous years end up there too.
---
**Wedding items** have their own category, since there's three tiers of package to choose from.
---
**Seasonal event clothes** have three categories (Male/Female/Unisex). There's also one for other general clothes such as NPC outfits, clothes from old, long-expired promotions, or other special outfits brought in from the KR/CN versions of the game.
---
**House furnishings** have a category, as do **dyes, emotes, Chocobo bardings** and music for the **orchestrions** we can put in our houses. Most of these only have shop-exclusives in them, except for the dyes which are largely just an alternative to ingame methods/using the market or emotes/music which also include things from previous years' events.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As long as you know what sort of thing you want in the first place and aren't just browsing for a way to spend money (go spend that browsing money on something better than pixels), the shop does a pretty good job of letting you narrow down your options to what you're actually interested in.
---
No more than switching to a raptor or any other mount during the track is ;)
---
&gt; And if it works, they'll keep doing it until it replaces the gem shop. 
---
Yea  basically, why won't a business keep doing what makes them money unless they realize it will eventually fail. Regardless, where is my OSGW2 where they redo things properly this time? Amirite.
---
Honestly speaking here... 
---
If the game grows with this continuing Anet way of doing things, to them they think they can just keep doing the same thing and get away with it. Despite all of us complaining on Reddit or wherever, has Anet really listened? 
---
It's not a nice thing to think about, but it's gotten to the point that you'd think that a mass exodus from the game might be the only effective action for them to change things, but at the same time you don't because you're pretty sure the game would die if that happened, and you don't want to see such a promising game that you like with potential just die off... sigh...
---
Tactics mean that T3s are never not defended for long. 
---
People want fights against enemy groups, not active wall defenders. (AKA arrowcarts) Generally, fighting against wall defenses is horribly boring for the majority of your zerg. Your scourges and mesmers get action. Your firebrands, revs, and scrappers twiddle their thumbs and empower/hammer every so often. OR, your siege players get action while literally everyone else sits back and twiddles their thumbs.
---
I think they were speaking more of the Tier system in general, not just Tier 1. The passive upgrade tree rewards defenders perhaps overly much. It reduces turn-over of objectives, which some find to be rather tedious. I personally don't believe that's too much of a problem that a few tweaks here and there couldn't fix it, but I can see what they mean.
---
More empty puritan shit. What exactly does you feel is missing in the class that it didn't have in GW1?
---
You just got a brand new cosmic themed outfit.....Then there's cele infusion, zodiac, astralaria, twilight/sunrise/eternity, legendary trinkets, that one gemstone rifle, full set of cosmic harvest tool, mail carrier, starry skin for almost every single mount....... That's not enough? The game is already overblown with all these cosmic sparkle stuff, right next to their trench coats and purplep/pink crystal sparks. Let's have some variation in terms of theme.
---
They keep talking about that teenage robot show in the SU subreddit but all I see (and hear) is Scarlet Briar.
---
So there's two perspectives you can have here.
---
On one hand, Anet REALLY needs to make ends meet, and they have fucking NCSoft, of all companies, breathing down their throat. NCSoft not only has the reputation of shutting down entire games and studios at a sudden whim, but also they reminded ArenaNet who owns them by laying off hundreds of their employees. NCSoft is a stern publisher, and the only way to ensure ends meet is to hit a specific amount of revenue each quarter. Because of this, Anet is forced to sell their soul, and sell loot boxes.
---
... On the other hand, they're selling fucking LOOT BOXES!  After they said "Don't be evil" in their MMO manifesto, too... Not only that, but they've doubled downed, tripled downed, and quadruple downed on loot boxes over the years. Artificial scarcity also increased over the years, and GW2 has become very predatory, even being criticized in Jim Sterling documentaries. The reward structure of the game suffered drastically as a result of monetization, with many rewards that belong in game instead being sold in the gemstore, and the quality of ingame rewards suffering or being neglected. For pete fucking sake, legendary armor dyes STILL aren't fixed! Oh, and the gemstore itself is overpriced.
---
I found a sealed copy of factions at a local shop the other day, I was floored with nostalgia
---
\*Rime-coated Mariner's Rebreather skin: exclusive available from BL chest only.
---
Remember the first mount skins released after PoF launch? The Spooky Mount skins for halloween? Yeah, the ones with bones slapped onto the existing textures that probably took an intern less than an hour per mount skin to paint, and they sold the bundle for 2000 gems a pop. People fucking gobbled that shit up like bottled water in a hurricane warning. I hated those skins with a passion, and the best part is no one ever uses them any more.
---
Well, others already made it clear in the comments. I really don't need to repeat the obvious just to be offended by an untutored brat.
---
Mmmm more visual cancer.
---
You're not necessarily wrong, but you don't really need ascended armor/weapons until you're really pushing into T3/T4 (rushing).  If you're rushing you'll need it for T3 because you won't have a good stockpile of mist essences (to infuse rings &amp; backpack) for extra infusion slots.   
---
1. 3 (ring) Infused-Attuned.
---
2. 3 (ring) Infused-Attuned.
---
1. 1 (earring)
---
2. 2 (backpack) Infused. 
---
10 AR slots ~ 9 AR each ~ 90 AR + (15)(Tear of Alba) = 105/106 for Scale 75 Shattered Observatory.  You only really need ascended armor/weapons to reach T4.  When people are rushing progression they skimp on currency (infused gear) which throws things out of whack a little bit.  But yeah, T1-T3 is totally fine on 105 AR and fully attuned/infused trinkets.
---
With something like this, in order to actually learn anything useful you need to maximize the sample size as well as you can.
---
I think perhaps whatever skewing occurs from knowing how others voted on this tiny internet survey where there is essentially no incentive whatsoever to be dishonest is less damaging to the accuracy of the survey than crippling your potential sample size, but I'm not a statistician, so maybe seeing results really does wildly alter the results.
---
Just looking to play for the first time and I was met with this. Pressing Cancel just closes the game and the "Location" drop down just says "Choose" or "All".
---
Oh, so this is common. There's not a word of it on their forum. Is there a fix?
---
Oh my the face effects on the second one for Scarlet look super similar to that of the mistborn outfit we got about a month ago.. spoilers?!
---
You can get them all for free. I think people forget this.
---
Also, the prices in SEs cash shop are fucking ridiculous.
---
even tho i agree with everything you are saying im still going to downvote the post because that is what this subreddit is best at
---
omg ohhhhhh no noooooo noo noooo noo kkkkk

Condi shortbow deadeye. It’s got the dodges to easily avoid all of Ossa’s attacks. When he loses his shield, he loses his breakbar and he’s a sitting duck due to how Choking Gas works (all his attacks get interrupted). Venomshare your Thieves Guild and watch his health melt.
---
If you’re calm enough with his VERY predictable pattern, you can even throw a quaggan in there and you still won’t get hit.
---
In fact, I can put the sequence I use into writing:
---
Shortbow3 his first 2 lunges, walk away to avoid his sideswipe/stun/whirl, Shortbow3 another lunge, walk away from his sideswipe/stomp, Shortbow3 2 more lunges, avoid swipe/stun/whirl again, avoid another lunge/swipe/stomp, Shortbow3 another lunge/swipe, and now hes jumping to the center - notice how no dodges were used!
---
Now after you dodge his shield toss, pull out the Thieve’s Guild and give them Spider Venom. Spam shortbow4 on his area but make careful use of the Deadeye mechanic + mercy to keep up initiative. He should be stunlocked enough to where you can just focus on dropping poison fields on him until he drops.
---
Joko would be proud.

---
As I said - it depends highly on personal preference. I already made dozens of characters with their own lore. I even build up an Elementalist that's an ancestor of my Dervish from GW1, uses a scythe staff and a dervish outfit etc because he needed a profession because the gods are gone. Guess what? Got completely destroyed by the fact they introduced npc Dervishes that use old skills and even transform into old gods. And as I said - obviously the only thing you can do is offending other people. You do this everytime you need to back up bad arguments? I'm not mad at ANet. They made a great game - it's just not Guild Wars 2. It's a generic MMO with GW elements. It's nothing they promised back when they announced it to the original community.
---
If you thought that SoI nerf was the big nerf you should check the one in 2016... those weren’t fun times at all in WvW.
---
I wanna add something from a player's perspective. I tried Archeage as an alternative back then and whales were one shotting you with their RMT-bought expensive weapons, I'm glad Gw2 doesn't have such unbalanced vertical gearing system. From a player's perspective I don't really care how whales get fashion skins in this game. If the game has a vertical gearing treadmill like those Korean MMORPGS then whales are a bigger problem and they make other people quit because of the massive imbalance. If it makes the company slack and deliver less contents, then it's another problem. But I'm not sure if it's affecting Arenanet negatively or not.
---
Agreed with much of everything you listed.
---
Can confirm PvP matches where I've placed gold 3 and been pitted up against the obvious as hell "Best of the Best" and "God of PvP" titled players. These days I'm honestly not surprised to see them in my plat 1 games and it makes you wonder if anyone else realizes how whack and unbalanced things stand.
---
WvW... I disagree with your complaint about stealth. Ever since HoT with the introduction of watch towers, stealth traps, trapper thief being gutted, sentries buffed to reveal players, freshly capped keeps apply 4+ mins of reveal and to a lesser extent - warclaw pings you on map... I honestly believe stealth is not as big of an issue in 2019 as opposed to years prior. I do agree removing reveal on scrapper and not replacing it with anything was uncalled for.
---
I mostly play OCX/SEA. I don't think alliances will fix anything, it's too late. The roaming guild I'm in barely plays, the main guild I'm in mostly just does reset days, and now I hear a vet WvW GvGer, pugmander + most organised &amp; best leader I've ran with quits is disheartening to say the least. The only other guild I'm in.... if we lose the other 2 prominent ones within that timezone then yeah.. I believe I'm done with WvW.
---
It's almost amusing to know they advertised WvW; [distinguished on the box art of Gw2 2012](https://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/271718-guild-wars-2-windows-back-cover.jpg). One would think they couldn't screw up from the get-go but alas, things are at their grimmest.
---
Each one of them cuts down at least half of their DPS staying ranged, except Deadeye. Plus, to stay in the subject, if we were talking about raw DPS and not burst, berserker, reaper and chrono deal more on their second set. Ranged exists, but is definitely niche.
---
"high-end shinies" does not describe Ascended gear very well, I'm sorry.
---
And the daily crafts which are really profitable, or not items which are sold to people leveling.
---
First time seeing it in almost 7 years.
---
Them hiring a bunch of new people does not indicate maintenance mode to me.
---
I didnt go through my receipts and put an estimate, but then I went through them and realized I had spent way more :(
---
What does 144p mean
---
Whatever floats your boat, puritan. Spitting on GW2 because you can't  bridge your emotional disconnect between gameplay and roleplay is ridiculously infantile.
---
[removed]
---
i got the starborn outfit on 59, glyph industry on 45, mount on 70, out of 85 keys
---
Nice. I still have mine too.
---
I miss playing that game.
---
Entirely true and fair points. I'd say the Values definitly are bloated right now but I would grind it if I couldnt skip it.
---
In terms of Legendaries ( what I am really after right now) I really enjoy the journey and checklist gaming for them EXCEPT for the Gift of Fortune and any Gifts like it. Lets face it. These Gifts are just obscene Money Dumps. There is no feasible farmable or alternate way to efficiently optain these.
---
Every other Gift tedious as they might be at times are fine IMO.
---
Is the original Guild Wars game still active?
---
They serious my dude.
---
I have these but can't remember my login and no longer have the access to the email. RIP
---
Don't worry, will be in black lion chests. With an added chance of super rare of getting a legendary one. Gotta milk the cow while you can
---
Are you sure? That's the last information I can remember: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/reserve-your-guild-wars-character-name-for-guild-wars-2-by-july-31/
---
talk about ancient
---
And I oop!
---
Gw2 is not what GW1 was but I think it's okay.  
---
Do I miss making a build that is similar to deck building in Magic the Gathering?  
---
I sure do!  
---
Do I miss dual classes?  
---
Of course! 
---
But GW2 has superior combat, which I suck at but enjoy immensely and over the years I got a bit better at. It ruined other MMOs for me. I tried going back to WoW and play with my friends but it just sucks! You just stand there and watch! No dodging, no positioning, I quit after a day. I love fluidity of combat, sure you can just stand and press 1, OR you can be a bouncy ball of punishment like my Daredevil, or command your small army like my minion master Reaper, or do... whatever the hell my Mirage is doing (seriously guys how do I play him? I got open world build from metabattle and I die constantly) but it looks pretty amazing.
---
I agree, it is not trash, it's just different. It could be better in some aspects, but it's pretty damn good in others.
---
Love GW1

I still have factory sealed GW Faction Collector Edition.
---
...buy it directly?
---
&gt;GW2 has never had any hint of realism in its art style.
---
Yes, it does. It's neither *photorealistic* or a strictly grounded milsim, but nor is it stylised like TF2, WoW or Brink, to name a few.
---
What does the "N word" stand for?
---
nitrogen
---
The breakdown is great and all but we are getting recipes for mystic mote/aspect after the community goal is reached
---
How is using "nitrogen" offensive?
---
i love the game !
---
Yikes.
---
Neighbor
---
I mean, I almost always only played WvW. Some festivals for quick skin grabs or living story content (because why not) are the only actual pve I play unless I really really want to build a legendary (which is a rare case for me)
---
When I see someone with tons of infusions on them, good looking pve armor, be it legendaries or hard farmed/earned weapon skins, I can't help but think they must like the game if they are playing WvW as much as I do and still getting these things.
---
When cat mount came, I didn't bother buying skin the pack, while I liked them, I dislike the idea about paying for all the cat skins at once or having a chance to get a random skin, which might end up something I'll never use. I still roll on basic cat mount while more than half of the server rides shiny ones. I might still roll for a blc cat skin later with my limited amount of keys but even if I don't, I wouldn't be too salty about it.
---
Don't take me wrong, I still drop some cash on gemstore time to time, hell I even buy keys when they are on sale sometimes. I like the idea that I can buy any blc exclusive item later if I have enough tokens. Stuff you can get are still random and rng initially but as a customer I don't have to nuke my budget for them if I'm patient enough.
---
Then I got the outfit, which was something random for me, I was trying to get one last ticket scrap actually and I was happy to get it. I wear it and go out to roam around. Oh god, it was so annoying to get 2 hateful whispers later. "What did that hoefit cost for you?", "You can't afford the infusion so you do this now?" from random people I've never talked before. (one of them wasn't even on my server)
---
I've never had such negativity in GW2 before. It's so stupid in many ways.
---
hardcore raiders know that having a set of ascended is way faster for swapping than legendary.  Legendary is good for trying new builds, not swapping to pre-established ones.  Some people will argue about inventory space, but the truth is for the price of legendary you can upgrade your bags much more effectively.
---
This article has a mention of it: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/
---
And this change was specifically made for it: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/removing-language-restrictions-for-eu-world-linking/
---
It's Susan.
---
i have said the gamer word before and didn´t get banned  😎
---
I don't get it. New bling bling get's introduced that is Black Lion Chest only. Then, after a few months, you can buy it for statuettes.
---
They've been doing this for a while already, nothing changed or got worse with the Starborn Outfit. Quite the opposite, back in the day these kind of items truly were BLC only with no other way ever to acquire these ever. The Elemental Sword that came out in May 2017 for example. Statuettes didn't even exist back then.
---
Hot was as fucked as Pof if not more do, but they actually had to nerf the worst offenders when they became problematic for pve or evolved into degenerate forms.
---
See chrono, exponential boonshare, epi metas, condi thief fixed after sloth solo meme, ...

" We made a commitment to you in March 2012 that we’d fund GW2 live development through non-pay-to-win microtransactions. We try different ideas, but we always hold true to that commitment. "
---
I guess a BLC-exclusive outfit doesn't count as pay-to-win then.
---
" At a time when there’s a lot of debate about random boxes in gaming, we should have anticipated that a new system with a random element would cause alarm."
---
Now is still that "time".
---
" Individual sale is a mechanic that works with a few, flashy skins.  "
---
Huh, you don't say. So where's the rest of the dozen outfits in the BLC?
---
" It’s been a challenging but wonderful goal to support live development and Living World purely through optional microtransactions "
---
At the rate you guys are going, I wouldn't mind you guys supplementing microtransactions with optional pseudo-subscription programs for us players committed to the game enough to wanna support it without all these random bullshit.
---
A derogatory term for people of color. Basically he was being racist.
---
Vicious troll.

It's too late because a population that wants to play wvw is gone.
---
But the main issue is that wvw repeatedly gets updated to be more anti competitive under the guise of "better for casuals", focussing on gimmicks over gameplay. See : every event, desert bl, warclaw, reward structure, transfer and link structure, ...
---
If you want healthy wvw the first requirement is allow us to EXCLUDE players. Second is semi healthy meta and promoting competition (imo preferably through objectives to promote fights).
---
We need the ability to exclude players so we can maybe, hopefully have a tier that isnt full of carebears. Without the option of kicking people off your servers / maps every single server, especially if you put in effort and it does well gets useless carebears that want to leech pips / gift of battle / ego. They inherently make proper, even fights impossible.
---
Since even fights, healthy servers / communities / ... are all impossible, there is no reason for any comms or guilds to invest time and effort into making them.
---
Just let the casuals play among eachother and have eotm style ktrains, I don't care. It's what they want. Just dont actually let them go to any strong server. Unless you can hard kick them from a server every single server is a casual carebear afk fest where you win by waiting until the enemy falls asleep and their shitty pugs occasionally feed you 5 bags.
---
The whole festival had no update whatsoever, only the most basic stuff that other festivals have was added (races having the adventure modes &amp; meta achievement update) it was literally the minimum the could and have done.
---
I suppose it could be very useful. For instance if your main demographic is men, you may want to increase the appeal of the game to women. Same for a lot of factors like age, location e.t.c.
---
Although probably quite a small demographic there is obviously people that don't identify with either gender. You can either have an other option, or I suppose just disregard them as not statistically important.
---
Map chat or private conversation?
---
I had GWEN,  factions and NF on a card but, I think my prophecies code was on a square enveloppe-like plastic coated paper.
---
Agreed.
---
Completed yes, but gold as well?  maybe I just sucked at them, but it took me far longer to do then some harder ones later on.
---
The good old days !
---
That's a shame, my box has "Cynn" on it, newer packaging perhaps?
---
Well sounds like you are lucky enough to pick your sex then. Personally I'd go with male.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Omg you outsmarted the system! Okay guys let's flood support demanding a new raid wing, they will then release a new raid wing asap "just to clear up the inboxes"!!
---
Milking players for money rather than providing a good product has been prevalent for a while. The question is why people think itll get better rather than worse.
---
Smells murican
---
Or older, they maybe didn't have budget for real cards back then
---
I meant the one with Cynn is the newer packaging.
---
If I remember, all pof maps have 2. Normal are of course easier, Crystal Oasis and Elon were easiest.
---
Does it matter? 
---
Will it be good enough to make a difference? Will it be before or after we go down to 3 tiers due to pop losses?
---
I guess they are using the ANet official conversation rate. 
---
1$=1£=1€
---
How so? He has to get the statues from lootboxes…….
---
No it looks like this is a bug from the new patch, first time that really happened, make a bug report and then the only thing you can do is wait, sorry.
---
cuz its broken atm, it broke with the last patch few hours ago, will be fixed (hopefully) next few hours, cuz right now its the middle of the night in USA
---
I already sumbit a ticket to support 8 hours ago.And no reply..
---
Support has nothing to do with it. They work hard resolving the issues they can help people with, don't make them waste time on something that's completely out of their control.
---
I loved when you got that thick book with the CD's that talked abou lore + the poster you got with it.
---
As somebody who cares about realistic, immersive visuals. Can confirm, I stopped giving a shit. The community and the devs obviously don't so what's the point. We've had countless posts about it but it was pointless because there's way more people who only care about shiny, like a bunch of mindless skrit.   
---
These days I just hope something comes along every once in a while that's in better taste so I can get it. Still waiting on a "old school, standard dragon" skin for the skyscale that isn't visual vomit.
---
support is not that fast and I fear they can´t really help you with that
---
And look how good they are.. so good that, as the post states, WvW has been in pretty much the same state since PoF release and PvP is.. the joke it is, its because they are great balance.. if only they had ways of getting help, like comunity feedback.. oh wait, they do, we give feedback and we still get jackshit
---
Please tell me your next excuse.. because even a blind guy can see that the 3 month break between balance isnt healthy for the game, in fact for ANY game
---
Search deep white knight, ANet for sure needs you
---
Hello, I am a new player and today I wanted to start my journey in Guild Wars 2. So I pressed start and got into the game where I was asked to pick a world, but there are no worlds for me to choose, am I doing something wrong?
---
Only 336 hours? you're lucky.
---
It doesn't matter. You get banned for it anyways.
---
It's not about gvg and its not about new blood.
---
You talk about new players but new commanders or communities are a more pressing issue. They cant be formed because they get hugged to death by casuals, leading to queues and inaction to the point where it cant be avoided and nobody bothers.
---
I dont get why it's so upsetting. Let casuals fight among eachother and more hardcore communities fight among eachother so both can exist and communities have a reason to exist and grow.
---
New players not getting to play with the most experienced groups isnt toxic, it's a standard for pvp games.
---
i am now using my imagination and i can cleary see the glorious fight between this poor infusion and that magnanimous outfit!! OMG is gonna be a sweep!
---
New Borderland was not welcomed by the WvW community, feedback was quite unanimous on the desert borderlands but they spent a long time developing it without outside input apparently and released anyway.
---
I like the rewards system, better than what it was and was far too overdue for what it was considering PvP had had it for a good while. 
---
Legendary Backpiece and Armor - Again nice to have but I’m in favour of the PvP skills/gear system moving over to WvW so meh.
---
Edge of the Mists was to be a testing ground for new features and what even happened with that in the end? Again another thing that went nowhere.
---
This. Ok, the pvp community isn't so big, but vacation has a big influence.
---
You are only allowed to say an N word if you are Spanish, since "Necromancer", necro for short,  is "Nigromante"  nigro for short in Spanish.
---
Don't be a dick and you don't get banned.
---
Because you are asking them to get out, nay, be given the option to boot a player off a map so you can measure your size against another guild. If you don't see why any new player who reads your comments (and they are everywhere), would be intimidated by this seemingly high expectation? When in reality, playing WvW well depends upon using your brain and learning your chosen class, plus rolling something appropriate.
---
Excluding new folks so you can gatekeep your precious gamemode is why it's dead. Not that it's actually dead, but as per your other salty comments.
---
Equality. everybody is equal, doesn't matter if he is a man of color.  
---
Either everyone can say it or no one can.  
---
/s
---
The game has been in that state since pre hot then.
---
The gears are turning.
---
It will be in the works for as long as they do not specifically say they have given up on it.
---
Maybe this is what the 30th is about too, alongside season 5
---
They did say once it's finished it will have a big announcement.
---
The Warclaw was the breaking point for me. That's when Anet willingly throw the health of an entire gamemode under the bus for a few extra bucks.
---
They also accidentally released a change in squad UI that allowed hiding one's squad. That'll be particularly more useful once Alliances are up, since there will always be random spies. sneaking in as solo players.
---
Do the survey even if you are not spending any money on the game.
---
The base is indeed in-line with GW2's aesthetic, I just personally prefer a more classic approach. As for the shimmerwing I don't like it because no.1 the body of the dragon is not made well considering the skeleton (thin and stiff limbs) and the fallout from the wings as you fly adds a lot of unecessary visuals to a mount that already has huge wings. It's way too obstructive for very little appeal to me. 
---
This I still wait for a classic, non-fancy version. If the shimmerwing didn't have the fallout I would even get it, I can deal with the rest but all these minor details just made me pass it up when you combine them with the visual noise in flight.
---
World selection is bugged since last patch but should be fixed soon hopefully
---
&gt; The gamemode hasn't really changed. And every attempt to make slight changes was greeted with an endless outcry from the WvW hardcore community.
---
TIL valid criticism and feedback that go utterly ignored to the detriment of the gamemode and almost every single player in it is actually just "an endless outcry". i feel enlightened.
---
So somebody else is going to decide what others actually mean when they say something?
---
Instead of just not getting hurt by words.
---
:D
---
&gt; TIL valid criticism and feedback that go utterly ignored to the detriment of the gamemode and almost every single player in it is actually just "an endless outcry". i feel enlightened.
---
Yes, I'm sure from your couch of ignorance it actually looks like valid criticism what you are doing. In reality, it's just endless whining.
---
Why not both ?  
---
End game commitment reward : shitty low res infusion
---
Gambling lootbox reward : high res dyable outfit
---
Should be fixed now!
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83638/world-selection
---
Without people talking about that outfit, I would have not known it existed in the first place. Now, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
About time.
---
...but really, there were rumours that mainly GUIs are left to finish...months ago. So ye, I would not be surprised to let them arrive.
---
DBL was heavily criticised since the beta weekends with absolutely no response. with its original implementation it was the single most detrimental update to the mode in regards to it's population. some of those concerns have since been addressed, but at a significant delay *despite* the early and fairly accurate feedback. even now it is the by far least populated map.
---
pips are a system that is piggybacked on another reward system, and is quite literally balanced around the fact that it is so easily abusable with "afk gameplay".
---
legendary backpack was a great addition and a goal to work towards. its implementation is doing one particular thing extremely right: recraftability. i still wouldn't go as far as calling it a "solid update". the armor's upgradability to legendary was an afterthought, just as a reminder, and the t3 set still isn't completely dyeable. (bonus meme: these armors are also totally unfair in a pvp gamemode, because i'm unable to determine their armor weight easily by their silhouette)
---
and edge of the mists... a pve wonderland that wvw players never had much interest in due to - once again - the neglect of early feedback. and when they tried to use it every now and then,... they got bullied out by pve players. i think that deserves an extra round of applause. (bonus meme: the official "map currency" of eotm was karma and not badges of honor for a very long time)
---
&gt; reddit or any other places they could reach their comunity for feedback.. poor ANet has no way to reach us other than the foruns
---
Yes, there you get about the same quality of feedback. As seen by your posts.
---
Gg Anet!
---
I get your point, and it also makes sense. 
---
 It's a simple difference in how I would audibly say a word and thus write the date due to differences in speech compared to any systematic reason I believe. I guess I simply conform it to the way I would say the date. E.G 4th of July 2019. I guess in the US though people say July 4 2019 which makes even less sense IMO. Eh.
---
Don’t worry, they will release some gemstore version that will be locked behind the black lion chest. That way you can get lucky for two of the six and then 400 dollars later you finally get the rest of the set.
---
Honestly, they should have just sold them on the gemstore to begin with. Since the only reason someone would pursue them at this insane cost is to buildcraft and save inventory space. Leave it to ArenaNet to make insane prices on something that’s meant to fix the inventory gloat they still can’t manage patch after patch even with random map specific items despite having feedback time after time that it’s a problem.
---
They just don’t give a shit. The other projects got scrapped, they’re probably all burnt the fuck out and disappointed and just want the game to die so they’re making as many bad decisions as possible to help it along.
---
Thanks for the math. For something that only offers the convenience" of saving around 4-6 bag spaces on one character, I think I'll pass. For anyone super worried about that, buying extra bag slots with gems or upgrading to bigger bags seems like a much better investment. I guess if you're already totally maxed out on this it's a nice option to have lol.
---
let's ignore the fact that people stops play wvw because of class x requirement. you yourself push away people playing it by demanding play x class or gtfo from squads. and then you blame anet that no one plays wvw.
---
I do t think we will see it ever.
---
Most POF specs haven't received their tradeoff. Things needed to be nerfed and they're slowly being nerfed. They're just doing the tradeoffs really slowly. Besides mirage still being overtuned (with or without ci) I don't think balance is that bad compared to previous patches.
---
nice drama post
---
It's on the release page. Type /wiki treasure hunt in your chat box
---
See what pops up
---
Can we talk about how you can't even jump in GW1? Yeahhh... Nope, as someone who only played GW2, I could never imagine a Guild Wars without jumping.
---
Point is, that's still not a fight.  A zerg against a handful of people on siege isn't a real fight for either side.
---
&gt; I guess a BLC-exclusive outfit doesn't count as pay-to-win then.
---
Yes? Are you implying otherwise?
---
Tbh if you have a monthly fee there should be no shop. Maybe max for name changes. Sounds increadibly unfair for me. It's like paying for an gym membership but then every second machine has a extra fee. How silly is that.
---
It was simpler times, you could get away with that :-)
---
same applies to comparing armor/weapons with upgrade components, you cant compare them
---
didn't even count the underwater!  Would be another 4 on top of that 11 o\_O  
---
Yeah technically it's possible, but I sincerely doubt build templates are going to have a function where it does "Take sigils from X weapon" -&gt; "Insert sigils into new weapon."  ArcDPS's build templates don't function like that and I doubt Anet would implement that function since it complicates the system and forces people to just not buy as many/work towards as many legendaries.    
---
But yes, you are right, I could theoretically swap them out.  Would just be a pain in the ass as you mention XD.  Honestly just keeping the sigils in my inventory sounds better.  It's not like Legendary Armor where it freed up a huge amount of slots (bags worth) if you previously needed more than two sets of gear (which I did)
---
Moving the best fashion skins from the gemstore to BL chests behind random (also 1st gen mount skins) is kind of a dick move, but obviously meant to sell more keys.
---
I agree on hard punishment, but in the end it's just a word.
---
you are taking reddit too serious
---
I'll put money when they'll put content.
---
What about W word ?
---
Those 30/30/30/30/30 warriors dominated PvP discussion/salt mines back in the day
---
Downvote all the ones who bitch and whine then. That's how reddit works, you downvote the things that do not contribute
---
Nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere, and we all know it's only offensive when it's against a minority.
---
&gt; you are awfully toxic right now  
---
thats a pretty toxic statement, care to explain why that is?  
---
i did at least explain myself why communication is better than non communication in the thread. see comments on celestial infusion &lt;&gt; new outfit.
---
As someone who recently tried wvw after not playing gw2 for years, it seemed to me like they allow you to just fly through objectives that aren't defended and clean the map without fighting any players. Couple that with low player counts and it makes the maps seem even more empty and/or one sided.
---
Game is great for new players because most of it is very casual and forgiving and there's lots of content to experience.
---
Two thoughts on this. First, yeah, that word is offensive to everyone with any sense of decency. Second, Do you know where Anet is located? Only in one of the most liberal/progressive states in the union. Now that isn't a negative jab from me, but in a day and time when flying the U.S. flag is being called racist, and the prefix 'man' on anything - even inanimate objects like (man)holes - is regarded as sexist, you must know that there is a red alert out there for anything that could be considered offensive - even *remotely.*
---
Don't use the word, man. Make the choice not to, out of pure human decency toward others.
---
Depressing is watching wvw and pvp die because anti competitive players have kindergarten demands of being included -when it suits them, without any responsibility or accountability towards their groups, community or commanders- and yet foolishly believe despite a steady decline in people willing to bother with this for years, that its sustainable.
---
Everyone can join any team they like in a pvp mode, more than half the pop of this game hates any type of competition and refuses to play unless when winning and you people are surprised that people move to the winning groups or avoid playing when they arent winning? Something which makes the competitive players, including most comms and guilds leave which only makes the issues worse.
---
Depressing because this has been ongoing for years and should be blatantly obvious by now.
---
I believe that the point is that it makes it hard for new players to keep up. New players that that the game mode needs.
---
So I should open only champion bags? Or any other bag from SW gives bloodstone too?
---
It's free so why not just dl it and see
---
We want it changed towards providing a healthy competitive experience. Most changes made it more anti competitive to make it short term alluring for casuals at the cost of healthy competition, which is why the gamemode is in the state it's in.
---
If you are currently buying gems, do you feel that you should be spending money on gems? *
---
Wtf does tis question mean. No I want my gems to appear out of thin air. Ofc you need to spend money on it, what is the other option, gold? What is the purpose of this question
---
There's no need to be facetious. TC has its share of problems, being full while we bled guilds who incidentally moved to trash-tier servers and got farmed by us. And we have enough trolls in team chat.
---
Did I hallucinate this bit of your comment: "If you want healthy wvw the first requirement is allow us to EXCLUDE players. Second is semi healthy meta and promoting competition (imo preferably through objectives to promote fights"?
---
The problem is, I'd agree with you on every point, but excluding new blood does not bolster a healthy game mode. See: Raids. What one of my guilds does is training pugs and teaching them how to contribute more. WvW isn't rewarding money-wise, but it's arguably the most fun I've had in this game.
---
D a m n.
---
(I mean both look like shit and completely immersion-breaking, but whatever... xd)
---
Man, if this is how EU servers think, I’m super glad I don’t play in EU. Exclude players, kick them off the map, what the hell?
---
&gt; there's nothing wrong with doing this as letter writing campaigns were kosher in the old days before the internet.
---
And what you're suggesting to do is write your highschool teacher a buttload of complaint letters because the boss at your current job isn't paying you enough. 
---
Customer Service/Support has no decision making power of business practices, so the only thing you will do is make it harder for support to adress actual gameplay issues by flodding their inboxes with what boils down to "butthurt reports". You know ,the same kind of reports MOBA players give to support because "he died a lot".
---
Last year I unlocked the mini, ignored the kites because they're mostly take space. This year, I opened the vendor and remembered that I didn't already unlock kites because novelties came after the event. Unlocked the 3 of them instantly using last year's tokens. Done, now no point in doing this event at all except for dailies.
---
... Talking about dailies : why did they make adventures for all races (despite the fact that the 3 of them combined makes it easy to find one for daily), but not for this event that happens once in a blue moon ?! Imho they should either make it an adventure too, or at the very least move the Favor out of it so it's not kinda mandatory !
---
Next gemstore item: Celestial Geomancer Glider.
---
I feel the same about the [Nature's Oath outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Nature%27s_Oath_Outfit.jpg). I would love it for my sylvari ranger if it wasn't for that weird bird statuette on your shoulder, wtf O.o
---
We have people who play WvW well anymore? :'(
---
I'll do just that then!
---
Also, are Jeweler, Scribe and Cook ever useful? Would it be interesting to level those on alts?
---
Or you could view it the other way around. It means that for the first time, a BLC exclusive will be available later without rng for people who can wait and don't want to gamble the chests. 'Cause we have an outfit selector that is available from time to time and I can see the new one being added in it sooner or later.
---
But I guess it's easier to bind everything in a way that lets you be angry.
---
fly? I hope you're just over exaggerating here, cuz there's no such thing as fly in wvw except for the jump pads on the desert map ^^
---
however tho, capping undefended points was a thing before aswell, just that u used speedbuffs, now you don't have to waste cooldowns anymore for movement, so I still don't see the point. the only issue I have with it is that it got introduced so late. If it always had been in the mode, nobody would bat an eye imo
---
I only like them for leveling alts. So they don't look like a pile of garbage, but I don't have to waste transmutation charges on armour I replace every few levels.
---
Does the Voucher include BLC exclusives? The Glider/Backpack bundle doesn't so I assumed it's the same for outfits.
---
awesome, don't come back
---
understandable, for new players it might be an issue tbh... I only can keep up with the zerg cuz I know where to go, what to do etc. and then its pretty close to falling behind if its greater distances...
---
That only happens if you go to attack a server that’s understaffed at the time, which is a thing I note ‘fight’ servers tend to do a lot even when they say they hate it. Instead of going for the one that’s of equal strength, they go after the weaker one. If you attack the one that has population around, chances are they’ll come out and fight you (unless they’re busy on other maps). But lots of people don’t do that.
---
Why? Idk, man.
---
Knowing that SU is heavily inspired by anime, does this mean GW2 is an anime?
---
so how do you compare all the account bound collections, currencies and opportunity costs you need to forge legendary armor/weapons to the miniscule AB requirements for the runes?
---
I've spent hundreds of hours trying to teach pugs. Ins spent thousands. Rav and cookie probably spent ten thousand+. The hardcore players spent insane amounts of time and effort training and entertaining thankless mindless pugs. Until all of them  quit or significantly reduced playtime. Except cookie none of them play. And they weren't hardcore gvg comms. All were focussed on leading pugs, anyone who was willing to listen a d play with them even casual players.
---
You read correctly. Servers should be able to EXCLUDE players and control who plays with them. Its wvw, where having more players is generally an advantage. Until it's so full things get unmanageable and it dies. Aka literally every relink nowadays.
---
Or, I dont know, so you can remove trolls, toxic people and griefers. Botters and dedicated afks. 
---
Its not the end of the world that literally every player csnt join the top servers. That's a REQUIREMENT for competition and in no way toxic. If new players cant join a top server immediately that is perfectly fine as long as there is a place for them.
---
And if every group refuses to play with a person, they should consider their own actions.
---
Let's be realistic. More servers would kick me because they're upset I called them garbage or kicked their ranger than wed have servers not taking in new players. But I'm certain I'd still find a place. Current system just promotes not playing or maximum toxicity because there is no other form of population control.
---
Warclaw allows people to skip PvP in a PvP gamemode. 
---
Mounts in WoW: you can't use skills without dismounting, you take damage instead of having a second health bar, there are no dodges, and the mount can be snared and stunned.

Meanwhile in GW2 it's almost impossible to dismount a mounted player for most of the classes. Not long ago me and a friend were roaming and found a mounted thief. Two of us couldn't even dismount him. Eventually we just ended up standing enxt to each other on our mounts until enough people showed up to dismount the other side - quickly realizing this, they ran away. 
---
Another example would be taking a camp near the enemy's respawn point. We had a good 2v2 going, but any time we killed one of them, they got back to us on the mount before we could kill the other guy. And if both died, guards started respawning which bouht them enough time to get back and stall. After 10 minutes we just walked away because although we wiped them like 3 times, it was impossible to take the camp thanks to the mounts.
---
Mounts almost entirely killed roaming.
---
&gt; I would call that "earnable in game".
---
Calling the gold&gt;gem conversion method "free" and "earnable in game" is like calling WoW a B2P game because "You can just farm the gold for a battle.net token" and wouldn't need to pay subscription fees.
---
I think when people talk about something earnable ingame they mean things that don't involve real money currency, and that the game rewards you with as a reward for completing specific challenges the game gives you, more than just simply "farm gold".
---
So let's agree to disagree on the definition of "earnable in game"
---
Necromancer mains are truly oppressed. First being kicked from pugs, now this!
---
&gt; You can at least say that WvW and PvP has variety in its enemies, PvE does not.
---
The meta, have you seen it? I see the same 3 enemies in WvW every day.
---
I agree that players running away is a very real problem when taking towers. Stay there and fight, dammit.
---
When taking keeps, though, once you break outer (and there are plenty of ways to break outer without getting under AC fire) you’ll likely get a fight. And that’s the main objective, right, get fights. The turnover of the keeps isn’t the really important thing.....because we don’t care about PPT and gaining new objectives anymore.
---
Well, I guess for bay and air you won’t get a fight until you break inner, but....
---
&gt; **PvP and WvW have stagnated  heavily as modes in the last half year, and arenanet is wasting one of  the most fun fluid combat mmos out theres potential. Oh and buff  shattered aegis** 
---
Let me rephrase it a little, OP: "*PvP and WvW have stagnated heavily as modes in the last four years, and arenanet is selling smoke with the Alliances 'cos they don't want to spend resources for rebuilding it from zero, that would be the only real way to save the game mode... oh, wait, they wasted those resources during these years in projects not related with GW2, sorry, sorry.*"
---
Better now.
---
&gt; Arenanet doesn't want competitive players in their game. Because they do not want the downside that comes with them. Just look at all PvP games out there #1 issue these games have is player harassment. I think Arenanet is too scared of losing casual players if they put their focus on PvP and WvW and attract these kind of players that enjoy competitive environments.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. And for proof you have to look no further than the fact that the fastest way to get your topic locked and a suspension on the forums is posting a matchup thread.
---
Why to worry about Alliances, if they won't save the game mode?
---
whelp, makes sense, it actually changes core mechanics of the game mode I guess, didn't know you cant dismount 
---
someone from it, ty for the explanation
---
2 outfits in the Black Lion Chest instead of 1
---
True, you have a point but what about Cantha? :D
---
I'm glad everything worked out for you!
---
I've had a similar experience and can only say absolutely positive things about the support. They have solved every one of my game related problems in little to no time, have always been professional, and very detailed in their communication.
---
Cant even mention their names anymore. But through that they will achieve legendary status and power. Like Jedi.
---
&gt; Where did it all go so wrong?
---
Capitalism. It forces competition, so companies have to try to wring out as much money of their customers as possible, just to stay alive among the other companies doing the same. Imho like 80% of the problems with the current state of the game industry can be directly traced back to capitalism's inherent "features".
---
Should be a ban as well to be fair
---
So, when do you get the bag?
---
I trade some lucent crystals in, it removed them from me , and..... nothing happened. No donation ticket, no bag, no anything.
---
Does the bar have to fill all the way? The timer counted down but the bar wasnt filled.
---
Can I leave LA? It'll be hours till it fills.
---
No i do not sede ant problem. Freedom of speech does not mean u can Say what u want. 
---
There Is no situation u should use some words. Comunity level Just improved with that bad.
---
deserved. nothing more to add...
---
I'll respond to this for the sake of a response though I think some of these contentions are just problems with you and the way you play pvp.
---
 
---
First of all, there's nothing wrong with pvp rewards. spvp rewards are quite good in comparison to WvW rewards and while they aren't as good as pve grind like silverwastes or DF, it's still a decent method to make progress in the grand scheme of your Gw2 value. The ascended shards have pretty good value and you get 20g + 100 ascended shards everytime you finish byzantium. 
---
1) This... would not be a smart addition. Most specs in the game have different playstyles. For instance, core guard plays hell of a lot different from FB. Similarly, specs can be built in different ways. For instance, elixir holosmith is very different from proc holosmith or power mantra mirage is very different from condi mirage. On a side node, I know you're assuming this in a vacuum of external factors but sPvP will never have the population necessary to accomodate this change regardless. It'll still be gold and probably even silver players getting matched against high platinum players.
---
2) I agree. Stealth needs to be changed or reveal needs to given to every class. I really like the way BDO does it. If you get hit in stealth, you're revealed so essentially applying the engineer tools reveal trait to every class. Similarly, in BDO, there are very few ways to reenter stealth. 
---
3) This isn't a real suggestion. "Base camping" exists because of lack of population and disproportionate match-making. Base-camping is a valid strategy even when you have 2 equally matched teams. Not that it would happen in this scenario but it is still a strategic move. It gives you awareness on where the enemy is coming from, it forces them to teamfight you (otherwise, they'll die in multiple 1vXs) so it consumes time (letting your points rack up), and it prevents them snowballing off of 1-2 kills. 
---
4) I agree though some of the core classes are still viable and played in spvp. Core necro and core warrior are still viable. Core guard and core scepter ele is still seeing tons and tons of play. And of course, S/D thief which is still nuts because of sword2 alone. I think the issue with Revenant is that it was never intended to be played without herald since revenant and herald were release together in HoT. 
---
5) I agree but there isn't much you can change about this. This is more a symptom of FB/Scourge and the way PoF has manifested itself more than anything. The bunkers have seen some switch-ups. A lot of sidenoders are still viable in play like condi staff mirage, weaver, spb, etc. The FB + Scourge duo is just too strong but will stay too strong with how the two compliment each other and fill their roles. 
---
6) wat. You just need to understand what you're doing wrong. You're the common denominator if you've lost your last 10 games. Maybe try recording your matches and watching them with the intent of improving. 
---
7) I agree to a degree. There's quite a bit of visual cluster though I have no problem seeing what I'm fighting or what the threat is but I can understand where the complaint comes from. Fighting a staff condi mirage while they're in their iframe/dodge/block rotation is rather hard to see and fight against in the sense that you have to be cognisant of which one is the real one (which really comes down to seeing how they move). Anyhow, this is a you problem.
---
Nobody can say it!...
---
...
---
....
---
But they caaaaan.
---
Thanks for confirming my convictions, bro!
---
How dare you speak, you, you, you, hardcore elitist! There are no issues, if you dont like the game, dont play it, make a break, come back when its fun for you again. Also, whats your problem with meta? You can play whatever you want and still have fun, amirite, my dear casual redditors?
---
Also, the point about sieging somethimg for 5 hours, it's not how the game is supposed to be played, who heard about a casual who has 5 hours of free time to play games, so since its a casual game, there's no problem with long sieges because people dont have time for that.
---
Tl;dr you should feel bad for wanting to have fun because you're not casual enough to be worthy of playing this game, having issues that arent about content being too hard and such.
---
Racism is still racism even if it’s in “private”
---
And there is no such thing as private when your using Anets servers.
---
They have every right to read your PMs and ban you, and you agree to that each time you log in.
---
*nods in approval*
---
While I agree that having to go through the map multiple times bored the hell out of me the rest is pretty good, collection wise at least. The grind was boring as fuck too, but not too bad with multiple characters. It could have been better but at least it actually was actually doable right away, unlike some legendary collections needing events that hadnt ever existed.
---
And remember, WvW still exists in its current state, so there is always something more boring.
---
Yes and also let us change the draw distance and not have dependend on the map
---
lmao if you think yelling louder would somehow make the elitist, exclusionary attitude of yours any more palatable, you'd be wrong. Hyper casual, wow, what a word. You think wanking over toxic casuals all day on a game you barely seem to play, the game you've been trying to quit is somehow the epitome of sane and healthy, idk what to tell you.
---
As for raids, I don't care about them? I most play story and WvW and as far as I'm concerned, I'm having fun there. Peace.
---
I'm inclined to believe Ylvina regarding this matter. There's always a large amount of full maps for metas, especially for AB. 
---
Question: What server are you on and is it the server for your timezone?
---
You'll find some uses for chef and jeweler eventually and they're fairly cheap to level (chef was around 3g last time i checked, too lazy to check jeweler)
---
Scribe though... it's very expensive and it can get even more annoying and costly to level if the guild hall you're using lacks certain upgrades. It's mostly used for making decorations (which can be expensive on its own) and you won't ever need it for your everyday crafting needs.
---
In case you get reported, yes. But by whispering a close friend (and he does NOT Report you), I doubt it
---
Those are unique buildings. What's the point in putting them in a place "no one can see"?
---
Yep. 3x Guild Wars and a Cpt Marvel movie. Nice.
---
*NO** they shouldn’t. Updating all vanilla maps with new assets and textures to hide what we weren’t ever supposed to see would be extremely time and resources consuming. 
---
Given Anet’s precedents in that kind of situation, they would go the easy route and simply add dozens more invisible walls and god knows we have too much of them already.
---
Maybe Anet has moved on from WvW/PvP? A lot or companies like to focus on the most of what's bringing them the most money. Maybe Anet has their own data that showed WvW/PvP does not bring in enough to justify more resources into it.
---
Did you think about organizing yourself? Why do you expect others to do it for you ?
---
Technically, you haven't heard anything from me at all.
---
Desolation is my server. I've been on it for years and it was one of the most active a few years ago (especially for clearing out Teq).
---
I'm unsure where to verify it's time zone.
---
But yea, Auric Basin is constantly the worst map for me no matter what hour I got (be it morning, midday or night) and I've been trying to hunt for that bladed set (have the coat left) for a days.
---
The key art one looks like you have two swords coming out of your vagina lmao.
---
I am talking about open fields fight, my friend.
---
Please consider before you mouth off a long rant.
---
Like I said, it is only really that tedious because you wanted to A) do it in one go and B) get it over with.
---
On the other hand, you and others would probably have complained about that there is not much content you can play when you could reach everything in a matter of hours and without grind.
---
And zergs, game advertises no holy trinity and then hits you with the FB/Scourge/Scrapper antifun meme
---
I wish we could manually pick with map instance we want to be in.
---
Some mmos have different channels you can  pick from
---
You can, but it's mostly restricted to players with a very high burst or players who can burst from range, and you *have* to be able to catch warclaw when they're in a hurry and thus has blown all their evades.
---
It's easiest when you're trying to catch someone running back to their zerg/thing they're defending, since they'll likely be using warclaw jump to get to their destination faster then. 
---
Though, Anet's working on a skill that will dismount warclaw, I believe.
---
Its even simpler more modes are required.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Yup, the things ive had some people say to justify spending money on gems. Had someone compare it to income tax from the goverment to keep the country going etc...
---
Apparently you have not played enough when you did not played on any of 5 LS4 maps. That's a year+ of content that you tried to grind through in few hours. This is your main issue and no surprise that it is not fun to do all at once. And not only yours, it is issue with many people that are loud about it - they degrade all the new content only to speedclear it, then play only the content that has highest gold per hour ratio and never touch the rest. Then they are surprised that they don't have currencies that are based on actually playing all that content.
---
I personally had all the currencies except from Thunderhead, and I fully admit that I even did not completed meta achievement on that map's release, so it is no surprise that I had to go back and continue to do stuff on the map. All the older ones I had good stock and I played most of them with really low frequency like once or twice per month. 
---
It is no surprise that griffon with only gold needs was smooth, as the gold per hour formula is mastered by many, single events repeated over and over again. Personally I don't see any fun in it compared to randomly visiting through the maps and playing stuff I haven't played this week yet (and that counts for core maps as well), but you do you... 
---
Collections around the map could have been collectible at once, I agree, but I did not mind to run around the map, do events, and collect stuff in between. And it was not so bad that I actually already knew few locations from previous visit, and every round one explored a bit different...but well, that won't change and it was one-time after all, so it no longer bothers me...
---
Ps: GMT+2 is like...what majority of people on EU server do play at.
---
Reaper shroud. Enjoy.
---
PvP and WvW dont make money in costume wars...case closed.
---
Don't be pedantic - it's obvious he meant "fly" as in rush through undefended objectives, not literal flight; as for why mounts are a bad idea, do you honestly not see a problem with a means of avoiding combat (10k health pool, 3 evades) in a competitive PvP environment?
---
Yep. Like Mukkefukk and Coffee.
---
Damage stats like everyone above is saying.
---
For traits, it doesn't really matter what you go for, because open-world doesn't need optimization. Like, at all. If you do want a build to aim for, I went with something like this:
---
01 - 20 Assassin and Demon utility skills  
---
21 - 30 Invocation traits  
---
31 Demon elite skill  
---
32 - 38 Finish out Invocation  
---
39 Finish out Assassin skills  
---
40 - 47 Devastation up to the first third-tier trait (Swift Termination)  
---
48 - 55 Corruption up to the first third-tier trait (Diabolic Inferno)
---
Invocation 3-3-2  
---
Devastation 2-2-1  
---
Corruption 3-2-1
---
Sword/Axe and Staff preferred.
---
The basic idea is to jump in with the demonic leap skill, use your Demon elite skill to burn through your resources, then swap to Assassin skills and toggle on Impossible Odds and autoattack until you're out of resources again, then swap back and repeat. Leap causes a ton of conditions, and when you swap legends with low energy you get fury, might, and a huge energy boost. Events and hearts just crumple before you.
---
I'll take that over having nothing catered to wvw at all, sadly enough.
---
Ugh, take this shit back to the donald sub.
---
Anet makes a lot of... controversial decisions, but in my experience their customer support has always been top notch. I'm glad they squared you away.
---
I was under the impression that each guild would designate a timezone and their accomplishments would be accomodated in proportion to their designation. Like a guild that slots themselves during NA prime times would earn more PPT during that time than a roamer for that same guild taking camps in the middle of the night. 
---
I agree with your second bit which is why i don't think Alliances are really going to fix WvW or in the longterm at least. Servers are already kind-of accomplishing what I think Alliances are going to try to do more explicitly but server pride is rather dead construct. Alliances just adds a layer of personal investment and guild pride and is supplemented by better tangible rewards.
---
That's reaching quite a bit
---
Shhhh.
---
I'd like to thank this sub for coming up with terms like hardcore casual.
---
I don't expect anet to cater to me. I do expect wvw, raids and pvp to continue to die. I'd rather pour the energy ingsme but as stated that has been made unfun.
---
**$43-50** C'mon Anet you're starting to make a FF XIV sub look *good*.
---
This post has to be the most tedious, uninspired boring piece of text I ever read in any video game subreddit ever.
---
if you wouldve read the parent with the children replies, you would've seen that I understood once he explained it, because I just came back to the game, so yea, good job on your part there being rude.
---
Please tell me you're being sarcastic.
---
It doesn't always draw out the zerg, though.  That's the point.  If it does, that usually means that either the zerg has significantly more than the attackers, or has run out of supplies and has no other choice.  But if it's the more populated server, the latter's unlikely.  They can still just sit on the walls and counter siege.
---
And that's not even counting all the times you can easily visibly see that there are more people inside the objective than what you have, but when you get the walls down and walk inside, you find that it's been completely deserted.  That's been happening to me more and more frequently lately.  That's the reason I've been playing a lot less lately. 
---
You're assuming that people actually play wvw for the fights.  People claim they do. And commanders will say "for the fights" or whatever to boost morale.  But the majority of players and commanders don't actually care.  They just claim they're for the fights and ignore any actual fight that rolls around, and dismiss and mislabel any actual fight as ppt.
---
So if your main point is that most vocal wvw players are hypocrites, I agree with you.  But if your point's about people not pushing the most populated server, that unfortunately doesn't usually work out, either.
---
On the inverse of what OP is asking for... The hardest adventures are probably this one, Elon Riverlands Master, Sandswept Isles Master (yet fast &amp; fun!), and Istan Master.
---
"But I disagree with the perfectly valid thing he's bitching about!"  
---
-rando redditor
---
No it really doesn't because you still have to open loot boxes to get the dam statues.
---
Money talks louder than community reaction on Reddit. Companies don't care how much you bitch and moan at them for bad practices. If enough people still buy there stuff all the bitching in the world couldnt change their minds.
---
Same here what a good games. I miss the monk so badly
---
I'm not actually assuming anything. I have no idea what other people want, aside from what they claim. I know what I play for and that's all that I know. What I was actually doing is to respond to the claims which happened to me in this sequence, strictly in my perspective:
---
Q : Aren't fight with defenders what we're supposed to want (according to the OP of the post)?
---
A : Siege fights are not a fight.
---
Q : Siege doesn't take that long to blow through?
---
A : Fights between zerg vs. few defenders aren't a fight either.
---
Q : Why do you choose to fight people who can't fight back instead of those you can, then?
---
A : Because attacking people who can fight back is hard, and won't guarantee you fights.
---
Q : Isn't that a better guarantee still than fighting people who can't fight you?
---
A : Your current reply.
---
I don't actually have a *point* to make rather than a chain of questioning what people want and what they do. My main point, then, if there is any, is that *wvwers can't decide what they want*.
---
Everyone say they want to get fights. Great! I love fights. But they always attack servers that *can't* give them fights. They blame structural defenses for the game mode not being fun, that being able to open structures quickly is the best for everyone. Great! But they also want to have their T3 structures, and if you 'risk losing your third' to try to get fights, everyone whines. And then they blame Anet for not giving them what they want, but no one talks and acts the same about what they want. Anet does play in the game mode. I've seen them around fairly often. What are they supposed to do when they hear one thing from their 'feedback and player communication' and see another in the game? Shouldn't everyone try to examine and *be honest* about what they really want?
---
(What I think people want is to be matched against people of their skill level and population size so they can take risks with a decent chance of payoff. But what do I know, I'm not a game dev.)
---
PS. Our server will always defend everything to the death and won't run to 'reduce bag feeding', even if outnumbered. If we aren't, that means we're doing something else on a different map or just didn't get a callout. We're not the best, but we'll give you fights! You're welcomed to attack us any time if we're ever matched against each other. &lt;3
---
They are making tradeoff to HoT specs to make PoF seems even better, in a last push to sell PoF. 
---
PoF specs will get their tradeoffs when the new set of elites roll around and Anet will want to sell them.
---
Because the warclaw did more harm than good. Are we supposed to cheer for everything just because Anet added something? WvW would be a better place without the Cashclaw.
---
i just got the skyscale yesterday... which means that it took me 2 months and a half. there were some moments where i was like "hell no" (i quit the collection for a little bit after crafting all the quartz crystals for the food because i had to do it a second time for the grow lamp - yes I didn't want to spend 30 gold lol) but in the meantime i still did events for the currencies so when i reached that part i had everything ready. imo if you want to get the mount super fast you will hate it. there are some tedious parts which are just done better in multiple days and if done that way they are not that annoying.
---
Read what you wrote and have a long thinking session about it.
---
Why are people jealous of nekochan?
---
I feel like this will change nothing since majority who wanted it have left.
---
There isn't many people left to create alliances with now.
---
Oh yep, you know why? let's be real here, its because all those players mainly playing gw2 defend anet for whatever they do. They love the game, but they fear an uproar and change so much that they can't see that its actually doing more harm and it can't improve. It's because of this gw2 will never come out of this casual shit hole with 1 hour content a week.  
---
Let's just go back in time:   
---
When GW2 was announced - not released - who do you think was a big factor for it to become so hyped? Yes, **the Guild Wars 1 community**. Then we got all those refugees from WoW and many GW1 players - who inspired others that it would become a great game - left because it turned out to suck on release. What was left has been a **vast amount of** **refugees from other MMOs** who fear change, because change would mean their MMO commitment could possibly again turn to dirt.   
---
The reality is, we barely have a community in GW2 that's steadily playing because they loved GW1 and love the universe. This community is so fragile because its pillar are refugees who have lost their commitment once and they fear it could turn out like that again even if they don't wanna admit it.  
---
See, WP played GW1, he loves the game, but you can hear him mutter criticism toward GW2 once in a while. He knows you need to be very aware of what you are saying in this community. Not just because he's partnered. GW2 is lucky to have him and I'd imagine that, if GW2 didn't have WP it would be much more difficult to bring forth valid shortcomings of GW2.   
---
When I compare FFXIV GW1 and GW2 I see so much right with GW2, but the core principle in GW2, features that keep you there, immersed and commited is better in the other two. The world is great, but the substance isn't. The practice of ArenaNet to just abandon whole game modes is a downright insult to the longest standing fans and sometimes even to the MMO genre. Abandoning dungeons, not modernizing LFG, Raids which try to cater to casualy EVERY SINGLE TIME which in turn make them 1 hour content at best.  Yes, GW2 has improvements on the genre, but for every improvement there is 2 shortcomings.
---
I hate them so much. Nothing more frustrating than taking a jump with Springer only to get blocked mid air
---
I mean, i played all that time with regular salvage kits + the mystic for rares, and i survived. You are right, but if there's one item in the whole store that you "really need" is the salvage o matic.
---
Actually it is . Selling mats is a huge source of revenue for almost everyone. Does that mean sell every single thing you get ? No. But telling them to stockpile everything just to make a few time-gated mats , is just as bad as saying sell everything. Especially when they don't even have a craft high enough to make ascended mats. 
---
The correct method is either save stuff until you know the game better , then sell what you aren't using. Or sell everything until you decide to delve into crafting, cause mats aren't hard to get. 
---
I have made FAR FAR more selling lots of regular mats , than I have from making the time gated ascended mats.
---
Any of the expert ones are fairly easy. Even most of the Master ones are pretty easy. However, the one at Derelict Delve can go screw itself.
---
600 monk faction farming. UWSC, dungeons and shit man the endgame speed running was so fun
---
Good to hear ma dude
---
What about running for gold, i fucking loved that shit. You'd suit up, fill up your party with a bunch of plebs and run all the way from ascalon to the farshiverpeaks, then cash out at the end for 5k gold a pop. Goodtimes!
---
Also, GvG.. that shit was done right in Guild wars 1
---
I hit healing skill every time I get barrier, because it looks like health dropping to 50%...
---
I uninstalled a while back which means they lost a whale. It might only be a drop in the ocean but I choose to believe someone there will notice a big spender with lots of play time leaving.  
---
I'm not going to say I left because the "state of the game" however, because it's a very small fraction of the many reasons I left. I'm just going to say even after all the hours I logged and the nearly 6 years I played, I never thought my play time and interest would decline as rapidly as they did before I chose to stop playing all together.  
---
No hard feelings for the game besides a little disappointment. Good fucking riddance to this trash heap of a sub though. Won't miss everyone spewing downvotes, low effort memes on the front page, the same recycled "thIs gAmE is AMaZinG" essays by noobies and whiners bitching and moaning about anything and everything including fucking textures on outfits for christ sake.
---
It's a dróg
---
Why don't we consider for a second that with the gods gone even human dervishes would have had to adapt to not having them as a power source, and that new type of dervish would then be easily learned by other races. This would mean reworking things a bit but they'd have to do that anyway to fit them into the gw2 combat system.
---
&gt; Why don't we instead make a profession that can channel the powers of more historical figures than just the human gods
---
I know right? We already have Glint...wait not human god. Jalis? Not human god. Mallyx? not human god. Ventari? Not human god. Shiro? Well, human, but not a human god. So as far as a profession that channels historical figures who aren't human gods goes Rev is doing a damn fine job. I see no reason we couldn't get like Varesh Ossa as a derv elite under Rev, or hell if we can't have a second human channel for Rev I can think of a couple classes that could do Dervish just fine with a rework to get around the human god thing (which lore wise they'd need to do anyway), except a Rev channel might not even need to get around that due to, you know, channeling a human who had those powers in the past.
---
Maps, maps were fantastic.
---
This has been everyone's biggest complaint for a while. I'm hoping against hope that ANet took it to heart when they said they were going to change things up for LS5. Let's keep our fingers crossed.
---
Never thought I'd say it, but I miss meleeball so fucking badly. Scourge was a mistake imo :/
---
This floored me xD
---
Thanks for this! Was an interesting read :)
---
Wish I could get the boxes... But I did the digital complete collection like a month ago for like 20€.
---
from a player perspective: how is it stupid to be against gambling in online games? you have read the news all over the world in those terms right?  
---
and just because anets system is more clouded and "player friendly" doesn't make it less predatory.
---
&gt;Becaue PvE is where the vast majority of the playerbase is. Most players aren't interested in WvW. I know. Hard for you to understand, that your preferences aren't the same as for everyone else on the planet. But that's how it is.
---
This part I cannot agree with. I see this argument a lot for why PvP and WvW get less balance changes, but think about what you are saying for a moment. The PvE balancing that happens is almost exclusively around raids, which is probably the least played mode in the game. Definitely less played than WvW, and maybe even less played than even PvP. If they wanted to balance around what most people play, they would be balancing around open world PvE. So nerf reaper to the ground, right?
---
I see no excuse as to why they would focus more on raid balancing than WvW and PvP balancing. Especially since raids are pretty well balanced right now. By far the most balanced mode in the game.
---
"This is going to be a bit of a rage/rant post, but im sure alot of it are sentiments alot of competitive players share."
---
Well yeah seeing as this is a daily topic I am sure a lot of players share this view.
---
* Almorra's point of view about Kralkatorrik will have its own moment in the future stories
---
Which point of view exactly?
---
Which means, you're no longer on the table.
---
last year, i already complained about my girl no buttstuff for the night of passion event. this year... literally nothing has changed.
---
Some people have bad priorities or self control/discipline.  That's the gist of it.
---
what you mean by that? where I am wrong here? just like people requires in raids to have unrealistic kill proofs so does wvw have specific class requirements of you wont get into squad (at least in gandara server).
---
Here as of late, I've seen (myself and guildies) Support completing tickets in 1-3 days. That's pretty good imo.
---
It sort of is, [This was linked here yesterday.](https://youtu.be/mnwuz3gPSUg)
---
She lost her whole warband to Kralkatorrik and had to kill her Branded friends, and I guess it will be hard for her (She is the Pact's general) to just accept the Elder dragons being not so evil, as it's been the way of thinking for ages.
---
That summary of the questions and answers is a bit dismissive, but there is one thing we seem to agree on: most people who say they want fights don't usually actually want them. They just say that to make themselves feel better, and use it as an excuse to . . . ignore fights. For some reason.
---
I'm not going to claim to understand the logic of people claiming they want fights while totally ignoring them.  Nor am I trying to defend their hypocrisy. Like you, I wish people would be honest and upfront about what they really want.  (And when they lie about it, I'm the kind of asshole who tells the other server that they're avoiding where our commander is and what they're hitting so that the other server can defend/aj.  I haven't done that in a few weeks, though.  Too many people quitting. I'm running out of contacts.)
---
I'm just saying why it's generally not a good idea to push the more populated side when there's a less defended option, regardless of which type of player someone is.
---
(And, well, to answer the obvious follow-up question of "...then what are actual fighting guilds supposed to do if they want a fight?", imo they should focus on defense.  Then they have much more control over how much siege is used, and where the fight occurs should they want to pull it out of range of their own mortars and whatnot.  Or they can just ask the other commander for an open field gvg/zvz if both sides are up for that.  Or if those aren't options, or if the enemy zerg's avoiding them, they can blitz an empty enemy objective, then bribe a roamer to sit in it and tell them when the enemy zerg comes to take it back.  I used to do this fairly often, even without a bribe, back when actual fighting guilds were a thing.)
---
Have you guys seen this dudes Final Fantasy character? Absolute Kreygasm
---
I marked "Pact's general", because her voice really matters, and she may want to make another fraction of the Pact that doesn't agree to just treat the Dragons as if they feel anything.
---
For all of lws2, all of HoT, all of lws3 and all of PoF?
---
Yeah, my first place was short lived. If it's worth anything, mine was posted first, lol
---
&gt; I think that "endgame" rewards for each gamemode, whether it be PvE, PvP, WvW, hell even minigames. Should have some cool cosmetics whether it be PvE, PvP or WvW.
---
They damn well do, what the hell is this bullshit argument.
---
Congrats all around! I am marrying my Guild Wars sweetheart from 2005 in November of this year!
---
Well it does mean that, at most, the outfits costs about 5000 gems if you buy all your keys and you don't get it as a random drop, obviously discounting any value of the other stuff you would get from all those chests.
---
Oh yeah! My Wa/Mo did that plenty as well. Good times indeed.
---
better times for GW and Anet
---
She's not a Pact General, though. She's the creator and leader of the Vigil, an organization built specifically to kill Elder Dragons. Yeah, she's usually hand-on with Pact related operations, but it's probably because she's actually able to get the job done with the Pact's resources than with just the Vigil's.
---
&gt;  Zojja
---
Not going to happen, she is voiced by Felicia Day. Most likely her new contract would be to expensive to one of most profitable western MMORPG.
---
There's two mindsets to players in WvW: k-trainers and fighters.
---
K-trainers can run anything they want and there are no requirements. There's also not really a shortage of K-trainers in WvW, population problems stem from the dedicated WvW players that are mostly in the later category.
---
Fighters want to get good fights and win them. If you want to win fights in a PvP environment you have to run whatever is best, because if you don't your opponent will. It's really not akin to KC requirements in raids and is more like simple gear/spec requirements.
---
There is a rather restrictive class meta right now but that is entirely on Anet and not the players. At release everything save for maybe rangers was fine because they all brought something to the table that could be used. Now elite specs have min-maxed everything from damage mitigation to boon output that other options are just nowhere near as good.
---
It just sounds to me that in your personal experience you've got more fighters on your server and that's not really what your looking for. If it is then that sucks but the reason your class isn't good enough for squads really isn't on the players in that case.
---
What are you taking about, I have so many memories of my friends, Devona, Mhenlo, Koss..
---
Jokes aside, your comment is lame and a poor troll attempt. And even if you are serious it's just not true
---
You know when you remove outer bark form trees the inside is much more pale?
---
Yeah that's what's going on!
---
Oder just showing skin
---
I wouldn’t get too excited. It’s likely the announcement will be nothing more than an extended trailer to the next LS episode. Complete with a new map and a 1 hour story and a few escort/collect events.
---
At this point I think we're down to few enough players that they should just move them all to **one** set of realms and have those duke it out. No need to build an alliance system eihter.
---
I'm sorry if the summary was dismissive, I was trying to be concise in a readable way! Seriously wasn't the intention.
---
I think we did that last one a couple of weeks back, took green keep and had people telling us when they're coming back to retake. (No bribes though.) It stopped being fun when more people joined our zerg and it got to blob size, unfortunately.......that's when we went to camp SMC instead because at least it's guaranteed that someone will be trying to take that thing every so often.
---
Unfortunately I share your experience about old contacts disappearing. RL, other games, burned out, pushed out by other people, etc. At least I'm finding new players to befriend, though, so my experience is likely less depressing than yours.
---
Guild Thunder 2
---
The Commander often has different dialog depending on their race, so a human Commander could have a different reaction to a norn Commander in a specific scene. It was used sparingly in the past, with it becoming a bit more common with recent updates, but the changes were never that big. My guess is that they're going to try and make those dialog differences more frequent and more apparent so your choice of race feels like it matters a bit more.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Almorra%27s_Massacre
---
I agree. Alliance release will make me log in, just like many other vets that have left.
---
I expect simple repetition of my gameplan for pips update and warclaw release : play for a little bit farming an infinite supply of GREAT players that cant dodge maps because there WILL be an event and every map will be queued.
---
 After a few stacks realise you cant tell if you play against players or badly scripted NPCs and move your battles to reddit instead.
---
Is there a reason you keep dodging the point about dedicated commanders quitting because of the decline of quality of the game mode and increasingly toxic attitude of casual pugs?
---
&gt; When GW2 was announced - not released - who do you think was a big factor for it to become so hyped? Yes, the Guild Wars 1 community. Then we got all those refugees from WoW and many GW1 players - who inspired others that it would become a great game - left because it turned out to suck on release.
---
this was literally me. i had never been more hyped for a game in my life. i fucking loved gw1. i was a wow refugee too. i watched every video arenanet put out about gw2. every interview, every mechanic and classic teaser. every panel. everything. gw2 made me want to pivot 
---
i checked and posted all the time on the official forums (when they finally came up), guildwars2guru (which died because everybody quit the game R.I.P) and defended the game a lot on MMO-Champion (although i did criticise some aspects of it too). i tried to get into every beta i could (i think i got into a weekend closed beta test, i don't really remember).
---
i had tons of pieces of official and unofficial artwork downloaded and set as my wallpaper (the concept art was fucking awesome and probably what got me hooked lmao) and also hanging up around my room.
---
gw2 was the biggest disappointment of my life when it released (and it still mostly is). it served as a great lesson to not get your expectations too high on games. its probably why i can't really enjoy MMOs anymore and its definitely why i don't really get hyped for games before release anymore, even games i know i will like no matter what (KH3 for example).
---
How do you know that except "just saying random bs"?
---
I'd say it will have more features than arc builds. 
---
Who is correct here?
---
Ah, please answer me with facts, not another "that's what I think".
---
Those are the rooftops of individual black lion vaults. You can still glitch into them and talk to the vendors.
---
This won't be a popular comment, but I lost all respect for the WvW community during the Warclaw update. The number of people moaning in team chat about "these fucking PvE players" taking up space in their worlds getting the Warclaw. The number of commanders who intentionally deceived their OWN squads just to fuck with new people/get them killed so they leave the game. The instant kicks and mockery for people who \*didn't have the right nourishment buff on\*.
---
You all made your bed. Now lay in it.
---
The skin has always been on the wardrobe, the item is just bugged and won't unlock it.
---
Something similar happened with two weapon skins on LW4 E5, but they fixed them somewhat quickly.
---
it is, but because of the mercenary/hero system you don't really need to play with other players.
---
&gt;You get 1-5 keys for free. So in the end you will have enough statuettes (more or less) as soon as the outfit becomes availabe via statuettes. For $0.
---
For 800 gems you mean, since you have to buy a character slot purely for the purpose of key farming and keep it that way for over a year to get enough statuettes.
---
Definitely this. I had the same problem a few months ago and updating arcdps was the only thing that helped!
---
The system is designed to put those who *do* remain into decent active matchups. Hopefully it works well enough to bring people back.
---
??? i merely explained why it's not ok to use slurs even if minorities reclaim those words in their private circles
---
Plenty of wvw vets tried for years, and this sub hates them for it while telling them to do more, more effort, more their way or to fuck off and stop asking stuff all together.
---
I dont believe anet to be capable, realistically, of revitalizing wvw.
---
The time has come to lay my old desktop to rest, and go looking for a new one! 
---
What are the stats I should look for if I want to run GW2 with reasonable gorgeousness without slowing down? I don't know much about computers but I know GW2 is an anachronistic hog in some way.
---
&gt; Or the mid-level salvaging kit looks like tuning forks
---
Yesss
---
I live in GMT+2, thats pretty much EU server primetime, and NA server lunchtime crowd. Maybe he plays on chinese servers?
---
The skyscale 2-3 were horrible for me too, the timegate and mats grinding I could easily live with, but those second and third 'hunt' collections with hints like "somewhere in Gnarlgrove"? Cheaply and badly done by anet.
---
The first collection was fun, finding out all the spots. But I guess then anet lost interest.....
---
Still more unique than the usual glowing lightbulbs i see running around
---
The guild I'm has gone from full Squads hitting the gates at Reset for 4-6 hours a go, to being lucky if 3-4 people even log in semi-regularly. Mission Night is dead, Raid Static is shedding bodies. Personally went from completing every LS ep fully to not even starting Warclaw or Skyscale. 1 Backpack from finishing Warbringer, but the thought of logging in and going to WvW...
---
If you really hated it, just follow a guide and it's done in no time. If you had fun with it, then don't. I don't see why this was hard.  My wife did it on three accounts.
---
1 mount skill costs more than a month sub, I'd rather just pay the sub.
---
&gt; Got the outfit, not the mount. But now I have enough statuettes to buy it when it cycles in, at least...
---
Mount skins do not cycle into statue vendor. At least it have never happened so far
---
Ohhhhh.... alliances on 30th august. Now you've done it. Im hyped. Preparing for let down :(
---
rox got a new voice actress and even female charr character so whats your point
---
A few days is not so bad! It's not trivial for someone with 10k+ hours invested into playing with and leading for a community to quit. I assume hell be around at times.
---
What are skills 1 and 2 in the beginning?
---
imagine thinking you can only play one game
---
Has Tom Abernathy ever seen anything so full of splendor?
---
I bet he's rushing lord.
---
You saw the part where that's the top end price, right? And that you're still getting stuff with those keys? Like, I get that it's a fun meme, but the chest drops really have improved quite a bit and you have a solid chance of pulling **something** fun or cool. It would be statistically very unlikely to get that many chests of junk.
---
&gt; Found the whale I guess..
---
"Whale" is fast becoming the "sheeple" of this subreddit: an abused term that people apply to anyone who disagrees with their "screw anet" mentality. 
---
For the record, I've purchased five keys since the game released, because they were on a really good sale that week. Every other key I've gotten has been a drop, a map reward, or a story reward (including key farming). I don't know how many chests total I've opened over the game's life, but I know I have 28 statuettes in my bank so at least since they've added them I've opened about 20-25. About half of the time when I open chests, I'm profoundly disappointed...and the other half, I get a cool drop like a wardrobe unlock or something. They're not as bad as people like you make them sound. 
---
But, I don't have a gambling problem, so there's that; I can certainly sympathize with people who feel compelled by their random chance.
---
The Pact is a combination of the three Orders of Tyria, though.  Almorra is the leader of the Vigil, but that also means she is one of the highest-ranking members of the Pact.  Not the leader of the Pact, the tradition is for the leader of the Pact to be someone unaligned with the Orders to minimize squabbling (initially Trahearne, currently Logan), but calling Almorra a 'Pact General' wouldn't be that far off of where her actual standing would be with the Orders combined as they are.
---
That comparison is entirely subjective. That doesn't mean it cannot be done, it just means that the results of it will differ from person to person. What we can do across the board is narrow down roughly what their gold to benefit ratio is (within a variance) and then people can make the decision for themselves from there how much they consider doing raids or world bosses to be a cost.
---
What?
---
Oh don't worry. I have no expectations lol
---
They didn't even bother updating any of the vendors or NPCs. Adding those two to the vendor list would take a few minutes at most.
---
I miss story not heavily focused on dragons. :(
---
I miss the old festivals, where both dailies were merged and you only had to do one.
---
Now it's just busywork for the sake of busywork.
---
That does not say there won't be season 1 ever back, that says that there won't be any *new* stuff aimed back at what Scarlet did (or any new reveals), except like in fractal or so.
---
Also, Season 1 would not be accepted by players anymore, now it is considered as recycled content... /s
---
The only downside with setting up varying dialogue like that is that if the NPCs you're talking to don't react properly, then it winds up not meaning much in the end.  And that's a whole lot more recorded lines needed if you are going to change up the NPC reactions.  More power to them if they can do that, they did in the HoT story with various sylvari-exclusive lines and reactions, but doing it occasionally for one race is different than doing it more frequently for five...
---
I really hope so. There has already been a shortage of fights in t1 NA since he quit for school and work.
---
It would nto be first character that got different voice actor, if that would be really a problem.
---
It absolutely will. MMOs are full of transient players. People burn out, move to what's fresh and return when there are new things to do. If there are new elite specs with Season 5, that alone will bring back a tonne of WvW people (a completely new meta). If Alliances launch within six months of that, even more people will return and likely remain.
---
Many people playing FF14 or BDO or another game now will return to GW2 when GW2 get's big things that they enjoy. Some people won't come back, some new people will come, and importantly, many people who are unable to WvW as much because of how damaging the current server system is, they will find the game mode a lot more viable for them.
---
I didnt write it was "difficult" or "hard" or "challenging". Thats you reading something into what I wrote. I said it was \_horrible\_. I like puzzles. So the first collection was fun. The following ones were like "what the fuck, seriously anet? Forgot to finish it?"
---
And really? A guide? If I ever need a guide for gw2 achievements, Ill uninstall all my videogames, because clearly they reduced my IQ to zero.
---
No kidding. Goddamn she was lovely.
---
You will just lose if you play whatever.
---
&gt; Tyrians will have to face a new way of seeing the Elder Dragons, because of Aurene. (For thousands of years Tyria looked at the dragons as the threat, called them "it", but now with Aurene, and recently Kralkatorrik, things will change)
---
it allows the writers to give the Dragons more depth by humanization. And something like can make the storytelling richer - so they wanted rather to make Kralkatorrik a character (because character can feel), not simply a hurricane that doesn't have a personality, and it's just an empty vessel.
---
I think they pulled this off well. Kralk still felt like a force of nature for the better part of the season, but got his big (and effective) turn-around into characterization at the end. Decent work there.
---
&gt; The questions about the Dragons' origins, the mysteries of the Universe and what exactly "magic" means - are the questions that will be answered.
---
This is reassuring. There was a part of me that was afraid that "mother" was just going to be an ominous dead-end made to make us wonder. Though on the flip side, I really hope there's more to this game's future than dragons and such.
---
&gt; But we will see much more stuff regarding [Marjory and Kasmeer's] close relationship, and will really try to make those main LGBTQ Guild Wars 2's characters justice and show the struggles and problems such relationship may be facing.
---
LGBTQ representation is an excellent goal, but *their relationship is not the most interesting part about these characters.* I sincerely hope ANet will develop them further as individuals. Kasmeer's place in society, Marjory's detective work and her brushes with E-- there's so much more to explore. I don't really care that much about the details of their relationship. Look at all the hype around She-Ra right now. It isn't even officially stating a romance between Catra and Adora but the characters are allowed to do their own things and still have this tension between them. I feel like that's miles better than this spotlight on every bump in Kasmeer and Marjory's relationship.
---
&gt; more Races-like behaviours of the Player Character will be improved (more Norn-y brutality and lack of subtlety - things like that)
---
This would be encouraging if we had any faith in ANet writing norn in the first place.
---
Thanks so much for this summary, though! I had actually been unaware it was even going on. But I feel like we're learning a lot from it so far.
---
The major problem with WvW is that it's a half-assed hybrid of two well known and popular game modes:
---
* **Battlegrounds** - These are full of endless action, kinda like PvP arenas. You'll always have a fight, and you'll never get bored. The matches are limited on time, from 30min to 2h. Yo can join with your guild or your friends, letting you organize and play competitively.
---
* **Open world PvP** - You can do wherever you want, and there's lot of complementary PvE activities to spend your time at while there's no fights going on. The matches never end, the fight for dominance is always on. Anyone can join, and there's no telling if you'll face a newbie or a pro in your next ambush.
---
WvW takes pieces of both of those game modes, but it never reaches its true potential, because those two game modes are in essence, contradictory to each other.
---
Best way is and always will be the trading post.
---
Then there is the Silverwastes and you can also get a bit of money each day through daily things like daily ascended material crafting or Fractal T4 dailies.
---
Oh, wow. Cool, thanks for the overview! I'm actually starting to get quite thrilled for S5. Without having to shit out an entire new map with every single update, I feel like we're up for some more S1-esque storytelling of just shit happening. I'd love a tour through ~~all~~ most of the loose plot ends.
---
"In All or Nothing, Aurene made her bond with Aurene" Aurene has a twin sister, you didn't see that coming, did you?!
---
"they like to make a contrast in the story - like in A Bug in the System, when the characters were just enjoying themselves, but when they found out what really was going on in Rata Primus, it turned into a horror type of story."
---
Eh, please no. Comedy mixed with tragedy barely ever is done well.
---
Gifts of Battle should be available through PvP too.
---
Yeah buddy! W/Mo represent!  I loved making that run!  It was fun!
---
&gt; om said that when he talked with Mike O'brien back in 2017 (when he joined the company) and asked what GW2's story is about, Mike answered with one word: "Dragons" (I take it as, the lore about the Dragons won't go away possibly ever - it's basically what GW2's story is all about)
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
Yeah since RG left the game there are only transfer pugmanders. I totally do sacrx impressions 24/7, they're well liked with pugs on discords. Ohwait.
---
I cant name a single decent eu comm that hasn't transferred servers... can you? I guess the remaining comms are to blame and if they leave surely others will fill their shoes and make the game better. Right?
---
GW2 just never got its hooks into me like GW1 did.  The two are very different games, despite looking similar.  It bums me out that I could never hang on to GW2.
---
Adventures are precision-based (you either win or not), and way too short.
---
Eir's funeral was such a fantastic opener, though. A great example of a calm moment before the kickoff of the next big story with Bloodstone Fen. All the different ways you could choose to honor Eir so that players could choose a variety of things to do. The skaald there to recap for players who are out of the loop. The resolution of loose plot threads like what happened to Garm. The clarification of story beats HoT failed to effectively convey (blighting pods converting anyone into soldiers, not just sylvari, etc.) I hope we get a scene like that for the start of this next season.
---
You can try using this quick guide:  
---
http://www.logicalincrements.com/
---
Make sure you use the regional select drop down to select Canada, and with your budget I'd look under the "Great" section. At $1310 before tax, that's about $1500 after tax.   
---
If GW2 is your main or only game, I'd recommend getting the i9-9600K instead of Ryzen 7 2700X. However if you play anything else or do any processing heavy tasks, then the new generation of AMD CPUs simply offer too much value to pass up.   
---
Keep in mind this is w/o peripherals, so you'd have to reduce your build budget if $1500 needs to also get kb/m/monitor etc.
---
&gt; But we will see much more stuff regarding their close relationship, and will really try to make those main LGBTQ Guild Wars 2's characters justice and show the struggles and problems such relationship may be facing
---
I write this with the best intentions.  I try my best to understand the struggles this community faces but I hope the story in a game doesn't become a platform to showcase the parallel problems the community faces in real life.  
---
If theres well written context, that's fine.  Just please dont have them struggle for the sake of struggling.
---
&gt; If I feel like I log in and need to schedule when I'll be able to do my dailies, something somewhere has gone wrong.
---
That's the GW2 experience in a nutshell, honestly. With the way that boss/metaevent rotations work, if I ever have an actual goal that involves them, I have to . . wait to have fun.
---
True, I've been noticing that more and more as well, and have thought similar. Having the Vigil pull an almost Hydra-esc moment would be neat, but it wouldn't make sense in the grand scheme of things. Killing one more dragon being a world-ending event has become common enough knowledge that I doubt Almorra would think it good to usurp the Pact to go on a dragon killing spree.
---
If anything, there being more Vigil members would make sense as the Vigil and Pact's goals have been the most aligined. The Priory and Order of Whispers wanted to stop the Elder Dragons as well, but they're roles within Tyria have a much wider reach as opposed to the Vigil, and by extension the Pact.
---
It also plays into why Almorra would take a more hands-on approach to the Pact's operations than Gixx and the Master of Whispers. She can supply herself and her army via the Vigil's part in the Pact, while the Priory, Order of Whispers, the major races of Tyria, Dragon's Watch, and other allies the Commander picks up along the way can aid in either filling out the rest of the ranks her army can't while also be supplying any necessary tools/roles that the Vigil wouldn't have been able to make use of if it were just them.
---
Will they keep releasing fractal CMs and add new rewards? I'd love to see a fractal armor and a way to upgrade Ad Infinitum with gold relics to get a golden Ad Infinitum
---
I was around 4500.  Game was astounding.
---
Maybe it doesn't bring enough because it has zero resources dedicated to it on the first place?
---
Wish it was available from PvP reward tracks as well.
---
This is very overwhelming

Having an MMO account being compromised isn't the same as having your home broken into and burglarized, but it's pretty close.  Fortunately my WoW account was hacked only after I'd quit the game for a few years, but when I returned to try it out again 5 years afterwards, it took some doing before Blizzard restored all my items.   Thankfully all my gold and materials had been put in a shared guild bank that my wife's account had control of lol
---
Glad it worked out for you.
---
That maybe day 548 could be the one?  :)
---
The story has really never reflected the dragons being "forces of nature" it's always been how anet talks about them but Zhaitan was very much intelligent and was actively planning against us. Dude freaking had the risen priests/priestesses say that Zhaitan ate the gods just to mess with us.

It's the Prototype Position Rewinder. It's a bundle you can buy from Sandswept Isles (S4E2) that lets you teleport to a location you set- very helpful in jumping puzzles.

Aurene cannot be the sole Elder Dragon, or any sort of Elder being, to control the flow of magic. We need a full set of six to keep things in order. Had Kralk been killed without Aurene taking his place, then the world would have been destroyed. The same will happen if Jormag, Primordus, or Steve were to be killed. Aurene could try to absorb the magic, but she wouldn't be able to contain it all for too long.

That was a big problem during Warclaw release, but don't generalize... Most WvW'ers tried to help or just stayed silent even tho frustration was running high because of the limited spots there are in every map.
---
A part of the community insulted and belittled new players who didn't deserve to be treated like that just because Arenanet pushed them towards a gamemode they didn't understand and showed the WvW community once again who the company really cares about.
---
Fact is they aren't transparent enough to see anything else but that their focus is on legendary gearing as obvious preparation for build templates.
---
Nice post, and I feel the exact same. I switched from PvE to WvW about 18 months ago, and I’ve loved WvW. However, the last few months have just really taken a turn for struggling times. Even after the most recent patch I’ve noticed less commanders and just less people on in general. Reset nights that used to have queues up the ass are now iconic memories than reality. 
---
The far more hardcore vets of WvW have waited too long for ample communication and appropriate changes (i.e. ‘alliances’), that it’s really no shock that most are either quitting or slowing their role. It’s just sad to see a game mode I really liked to just go quite stagnant. To the point where i actually don’t even log in much anymore myself; and the fact that ALL other game modes are suffering, really just makes me turned off from logging on, period.
---
Won't their price rise up as you can use them for non-timegated provisioner token acquiring?
---
Canach is one of the best characters in the game.  he doesn't need a past or an arc.  in fact his lack of one makes him all the better!
---
We're so information hungry even random bugs fill us with hopes...
---
&gt; Without having to shit out an entire new map with every single update,
---
are they moving away from a map/episode?
---
I'd say tengen toppa, but there were no twintails ;c
---
It's certainly concerning that that's the first thing that comes to his mind with those characters, as if its their defining characteristic as opposed to just something they happen to be.
---
you forgot the part where the carebears and white knights tell wvw players that they are entitled, just got a huge chunk of love, should be grateful, and can't be pleased no matter what.
---
Would Warclaw still be a problem if they just massively nerfed it’s HP? or gave it some debuff that said like “Warclaw’s Take 200% more damage from players”. I’m not a WvW vet by any stretch but the movement seems not that out of line if it didn’t offer so much safety otherwise.
---
That would only matter if WvW were alive enough for people to care enough about winning that they spend time spying...
---
Same for me. Never got hooked. I tried it, but GW1 is still my favorit mmorpg.
---
Being a "member in spirit" doesn't make the Commander a member of the Pact. We can make use of their resources because we're essentially the world's foremost expert on dragon slaying, so it would make sense that the Pact (an organization made to kill the Elder Dragons) would let us use them from time to time when confronting dragons. Did you notice that how we had to build up our own army to confront Joko, as opposed to just calling up the Pact to take charge? It would have been easy if the Commander had an actual part in the organization, but they don't so they needed to work with what they had instead.
---
Again, Almorra is not a member of the Pact, she just takes a hands-on approach with then because both it and the Vigil have had the same end goal.
---
Think of the Pact as a car manufacturing company formed in collaboration between three corporations. One specializes vehicle making, one in telemarketing, and another in general tech. It would make sense that Almorra, the CEO of the vehicle making corporation, would want to take a lead in the car manufacturing company because she has more at stake in it.
---
Also it could have been any leader of the three Orders to ask the Commander to take control of the Pact, but it just so happens that Almorra is more involved in the Pact so it would make sense for her to take the initiative in asking.
---
Distinction being that FF XIV seems to actually drop rewards from dungeons/raids and the like.  Cosmetics are something that I really don't care too much about relative to the average GW2 player.
---
That issue should've been solved years ago by replacing her VA. Zojja has been completely deleted from the game at this point. I can't imagine how they can bring her back without it being very awkward.
---
Furnace is taken!
---
The ones I saw were asking for the account bound ones, which since you can't buy them means no price spike from demand, though you might see a bit less supply due to people spending them there instead of selling, but there's not a lot of need for prov tokens outside of legendary armor/runes. But then if there's less supply and prices go up the higher profit will lead to more people doing the daily crafts to sell, probably.
---
I don't get it.  What is special about that skin?
---
Have you ever been in a GvG guild? Or is this about NA?
---
Thanks for explaining it for him in a good manner, i'm incapable of doing that anymore.
---
So what? You can still deside to convert gold to gems. It doesn't matter if someone else bought them or not. Other games don't give you this option in the first place.
---
Maybe I'd be fine with Warclaw if it had 1 hp and no dodges, or maybe 1 dodge. Purely as a tool of transportation it's alright to have if they really wanna add it. It's fine if it takes you to battle faster than if you chose to walk, it's just wors for it to make the player virtually untouchable and help them escape anything.
---
That'd be kinda cool imo, if it had 1 hp new playstyles could be created around it. Like having trapper DHs and rangers dismount half an enemy zerg by correctly predicting their movements and setting up their traps on the road.
---
Yeah, what is this?
---
You haven't played too many games...especially a lot of MMORPGs or JRPGs then.

Hello.

Is it possible to play the living story as a party if one of the members does not have it unlocked?
---
And, if possible, will this player get the rewards?
---
Thanks.
---
Ohhh, the Grove. The Evergreen of screenshots. No pun intended. I like it. :)
---
It's a sign of alliances coming. Praise Joko!
---
During the festivals it should be on top and people will use it more frequently.
---
I have that happen to me from time to time.
---
What fixes it for me it so launch gw2 with the -repair so that it will check integrity
---
That takes _skill_
---
bleh im salty not getting the outfit after buying 100 keys
---
Weebs
---
One of the reasons I always love the priory, but hate the end part of the story.
---
ascended trinkets and backpiece can be obtained easily in ls3 maps.
---
Exotic armor can be obtained in TP quite cheaply these days. Probably &lt;10G for whole set
---
That doesn’t change what I said
---
What do you think about making the gift of exploration (and possibly other varied components for 2nd gen) available through pvp/wvw/buying so the wvw/pvp players don’t have to do pve for legendaries?
---
oohh, how did you do that ? :-)
---
A GOOD story is at its core about the tug of war between good and evil within the human heart and psyche. Slapping on sociology doesn't make the story good if you don't have a solid core. S8 of game of thrones was NOT bad because of a "lack of sociology". And GW2 focusing on sociology shouldn't encourage anyone. 
---
&gt; It's really hard to explore the sociology of Elona in the primary narrative when most of the PoF story instances contained no Elonians, instead bringing Dragon's Watch along. 
---
That's because the primary narrative of GW2 has never been about Elonians. 
---
Could the story benefit from more complexity and showing the different conflicts between groups more in depth? Absolutely, but only if the core of the story is good to begin with, otherwise it will just ring hollow. Take for example the whole thing about Marjory and Kasmeer, the most interesting quality about their story shouldn't be "omg they're lesbians and that's important for representation", it should an internal conflict, one they've yet to show even exists. And now it seems they're doubling down on them just being token representatives of lesbians. 
---
GW2 has a shell of a story, and will continue to have a shell of a story even if one of the writers mentions "sociology" as an important factor, because it really isn't important when the foundation is rotten, it in fact just becomes a detriment at that point.
---
For me my lifetime rate of clovers is about 22%.  I have a spreadsheet where I keep track everytime I roll for clovers but it's horribly depressing when the rate is supposed to average out to just over 30% but for me, after about 2000 clovers I have a 22% rate of getting them :/
---
Man, i've been itching for an mmorpg and i started up guild wars 2, and it's been fun, but i've been having a hard time finding a commander or a guild to join for WvW, and when i try to roam around alone, i just get stomped by opposing roaming teams who have 3 or more people. Even though i dished out the money for PoF, it kinda just makes me want to go back to WoW

Felicia Day also stated she would be happy to reprise her role as Zojja. So people kind of believe it's ANet making the call to avoid Zojja entirely. Idk, that was a while back and we haven't heard anything since.

I believe that's meant to be Mordremoth's corruption. Doubt it was a hint to an outfit that came out 6 years later.

The real endgame content
---
You know, that'd actually curb a ton of bitching and whining. I'd gladly do that job. "Yo James, how is X coming? Alright, cool. Thanks."
---
They could pretty easily do some extra bonuses that change every month, like a 24+ slot bag, character slots, bank tabs, etc.
---
The currency grinding thing was rough. I made it my primary focus to just gather currency and farm nodes and hearts. I never wanna touch a living story meta again for a while..The entire process wasn’t too enjoyable honestly but the skyscale is super useful and almost a must have for me now, it’s the only mount I use. You seem to be burning out, slow it down and do a couple tasks a day.
---
Everyone's rather cynical about the sort of events. There's not really any reason why they have to fake it.
---
&gt;Discovering the spending habits of the average GW2 Redditor 
---
From the link...
---
I literally put in 220 coins one day. Got 30 clovers out of it.
---
The next time, I put in 80 and got 60 clovers back.
---
Variance is a bitch.
---
The tonic is from Long Live the Lich, iirc. Not hard to obtain either - heart vendor for karma and some inscribed shards iirc.
---
That makes sense.  Thank you.
---
Leap doesn't cause conditions anymore but pulls targets together, instead the elite now pulses torment without the previous stat increases. Still a good approach tho.
---
You omitted [Azimuth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Azimuth)  from the HoT weapon rewards
---
I woulda just deleted my account on the spot
---
Only season 2 and other players don't get anything if they don't own it.
---
I don't think all her appearances have Gwen has her name
---
On that note I’m thankful they don’t make us grind out a “gift of spvp” as well.  We can buy all the shards of glory we need on the TP.
---
Imagine all the pve nerds like me stinking up spvp matches to get legendaries.
---
People only like Canach because he makes jokes that are no socially acceptable in real life. I make jokes like that and people give me weird looks and don't laugh. Like jokes about blowing stuff up are taken as distasteful because of 9/11 or whatever other terrorist accident.
---
You don't have to buy anything. However, if you are an altoholic, you will buy char slots anyway, that's not a cost factor for getting keys. 
---
You could also say "for 2000 gems since you need to lvl your char and a lvl 80 boost costs 2000 gems" and see how ridiculous this kind of argument is.
---
Tnx to all:)
---
It feels limp and next to useless in any form of PvE, especially compared to Ranger or Warrior LB. No idea about PvP.
---
I'm not trying to be rude but... where is the professional part?
---
*"•the Narrative Team structure is: 4 writers/narrative designers (recruiting for a 5th) working on GW2"*

---
&gt;our latest system of 3 trait lines with 3 "skill" choices per trait.
---
One baseline Minor trait and a choice of one of three Major traits in each of the three tiers in each of the three specializations you can have in a build
---
&gt; his favourite Quaggan is Drooburt
---
Drooburt stiffed me, ten bags of nothing! Someone get me a Ghostbore Musket!
---
when going into the pvp lobby you are:  
---
- automatically level 80  
---
- all runes / stats / skills / traits unlucked there (middle of the screen ontop -&gt; build)  
---
- your starter armor needs to be in those slots, playing naked reduces your armor, however it doesn't matter which additional armor you equip or which level it is later on, just the armor stats get taken and won't vary anymore  
---
- you need to reach pvp rank 20 to be able to play ranked games  
---
- to travel to the mists (pvp lobby) you probably need to key-bind the pvp panel in the options, since that is "unlocked" later on when leveling in pve.  
---
wvw: you get upleveled in wvw and you get a bit of stats, but you will be way worse then anyone else there on level 80, especially without experience. so leveling up to 80 is advised first. you get level through playing pvp, so if you do not want to pve at all, this is no problem.
---
Since when have elder dragons been “not so evil”? They’ve only ever expressed malice towards Tyrians. Heck, they even hate each other too.
---
RIP Ricochet
---
no, there's no reason, because I've not seen any quit due to "toxic attitude of casual pugs"
---
I have, however, seen many new players be afraid of trying out WvW despite interest because of the toxic attitude of the "hardcore" crowd
---
Good ol' lifesteal through her invulnerability with skelk venom/traits/sigils
---
I'm gonna be honest, played since beta.............not a damn thing about those would make me connect them to GW2.
---
Would be more immersive if they adjusted the invisible walls in some areas to actually be *less* restrictive. Like, you can't fly over the cliff where Issormir's corpse is, among many other areas.
---
Does he? I remember his name being on the list of people who got laid off.
---
The end says "Sorry"
---
Would be a more immersive change if they actually *scaled back* on the invisible walls in some areas to be less restrictive. Can't fly over the cliff where Issormir's corpse is, among many other areas.
---
Just thinking about that makes my hand hurt.
---
&gt; even someone that doesn't play LS4 maps could easily have more than enough by this point. All of those were from the home instance.
---
Dont you kinda need to do S4 maps to get the currency to buy the home nodes? I agree home nodes are a great way to get map extra currency over time but they dont get handed out for free.
---
Thanks for your statistical sacrifice.
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
It's hard to arrange all those 1s and 0s by hand.
---
rude
---
pvp is was death when they decided to trew out of the window esport and release a beta of at tournament (still in beta at the moment after 2 year), spvp season were always bad designed and after season 5 probably the best season spvp become dead even more....
---
I dislike the aesthetic. Figmas would work nicely for GW2's realistic style (maybe Nendoroid for Taimi...). And mass-market scale figures, similar to Tera's.
---
&gt; How are people still finding references to it?   
---
Very easily, actually.  Back when I joined this game in January of 2017, before ANet revamped the forums, I was looking for mesmer build advice early on and found posts in that same #/#/#/#/# format before I ever found anything about the HoT trait system.
---
"TLDR: No, dammit, I worked pretty hard on this, go read the table at least."
---
Upvoted purely for this!
---
Seriously though, good work.
---
Thank you for this. From now on, I'll be always linking here all those ~~flat earthers of tyria~~ doomtrolls.
---
We need more people like you here.
---
One has to wonder what they were really thinking with how utterly weak those weapons were for how much time investment they cost to get...
---
Ah, I missed those. I had originally started compiling the festival content as well, but I gave up and thought I had deleted all the skins from the google doc. Clearly I didn't go through the infusions row.
---
Yet list is huge.
---
The gem store: the thing that allows everyone to spend 7+ years in a game for less then 100 euros, but somehow is evil incarnate because the texture of one of its outfits is prettier than an ingame one.
---
Carl from ATHF looking good
---
This was by far the most disappointing part. Good fantasy stories rely on myth and archetype, not shoe horning in sociology and modern political thought.
---
Disagree strongly, we fell so far. The old system was more fun and allowed for way more build diversity and build crafting. When they updated the system to our current one they nuked several playstyles
---
The summary is missing the rest of that answer. They're not going to focus on that aspect. Go read the forum post about it.
---
I would rather have proper figurines instead of these ugly waterhead funko and nendoroid abominations... :/
---
It's still a small subset even of the GW2 redditors. The (unreliable) information is only being gathered by GW2 redditors who 1) See the title, 2) Care enough to read the post, and 3) Actually take the survey.
---
That Kralkatorrik wasn't that evil, doesn't mean Jormag/Primordus/DSD will also have something good in them. 
---
I mean Kralkatorrik's goodness can be explained by (not yet confirmed) the Forgotten's attempt to convert Kralkatorrik. It's my personal speculation that maybe his body wasn't purified as Glint's was, but some part of him was - his Heart.
---
Tomorrow Anet implements amazing high-def monster skins for fractals, next week people have farmed them and will complain that there is nothing to do.
---
What you're begging for is skinner box gameplay which Anet made an distinct effort to avoid as a design philosophy. Bigger, better, and always more, more, more, because what's been released has already been consumed.
---
&gt; You literally do though, If you have all your slots filled up you HAVE to buy another one.
---
Like you "HAVE" to do for any other new char. 
---
&gt; should I need to key farm I would need to buy another slot since I didn't buy all those slots to leave them empty and they now have characters
---
Depending on how hard you do the farm, you play those farm chars way more then only 10 minutes per week, even though you delete them after a week. Except for the deleting it's just like a normal char.
---
&gt; BLK farming requires an empty character slot at all times
---
**Every** char requires an empty char slot at all times. It's like I said before, if you want to make a new char, you will buy a slot anyway. There is no difference here. 
---
But okay, let's say you *have* to get a new char slot for your farm char. You need to pay 800 gems *once*. That's $10 or 250 gold for literally "unlimited keys" (1-endless per week, depending on your effort) AND the ability to pick the BLC skin of your choice from statuettes every now and then. 
---
Even though you wouldn't call it "free", $10 or 250g is *way* cheaper than $60 for each skin. 
---
And if you want to do some math, you could say it's "free" after 9 keys. 10 keys cost 900 gems (2x 5 for 450), so with the 10th farmed key, your keys are worth more than your char slot (800 gems). So after 2-10 weeks (depending on your effort) all further keys really are for free.
---
I see people offering home instances in Rata Sum all the time
---
Hey, if this thread gets traction I'll feel motivated to add those too.
---
And I was trying to include what I considered to be "meaningful" rewards, which includes but is not limited to aesthetic rewards. I completely accept that my definition of meaningful might not be yours.
---
Scourge cannot exist in competitive gamemodes and be balanced, the aoe boon corrupt and pulsing condition bomb concept is fundamentally broken unless you nerf it into unusability. Firebrand is the natural response to the problem, providing aoe stability to deal with the fear spam + knockdowns from heralds, and scrapper is the second response, providing ridiculous cleanses with antitoxin runes to cancel out scourge bombs. The entire zerg meta is literally focused around neutralizing scourge damage and conditions, which is really unhealthy .\_.
---
Honestly updating [Chain Pull](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chain_Pull) to also pull mounted players would help. It will also acted as a skill 1 attack dismounting you and them. That will help some but Anet needs to make a WvW low cost [trap or trick](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Traps_and_Tricks) just for Warclaws so if you are taking to take a camp you have options if an enemy Warclaw pops up. That's also if you have enough sup on you. Just some food for though from a roamer :B
---
Mounts, skins, gear, masteries, collectibles, achievements en masse like crazy: LitTlE tO No ReWardS
---
I swear it's like all the people who got duped by Anet with their raids thinking GW2 turns into a gear treadmill instanced content WoW-esque MMO *finally* start to realize that they hopped on the wrong train. But instead of going silently into that night, they try their damn hardest to get the game to cater to their content.
---
I actually do blame Anet for that. That's what you get for trying so damn hard to catch everyone without actually following through.
---
I mean, Caithe DID stay in Tarir with Aurene for the whole time of season 3. While Commander was out looking for "Lazarus"
---
There's a fine line between putting items on your IG store, which is perfectly fine to make a living, and said IG store being your primary focus for almost everything you release. That's what people are pointing at in most cases. Not the fact that there's a store with items, but the fact they largely outnumber the rest.
---
Just because you have the choice not to spend your cash on it doesn't mean it's legit and shouldn't be questioned. Especially when it can hurt the game itself. Because that kind of thinking can lead to a vicious circle: 
---
People are getting tired of new content being shoved in gemstore rather than unlockable IG -&gt; said people end leaving the boat for another MMO -&gt; income from gem store dwindles -&gt; even more items are shoved in the gem store to compensate and cash in on the whales still left -&gt; people are getting even more tired of new content being shoved in the gemstore rather than unlockable IG, rinse and repeat.
---
Bad business model can hurt a game, it's always good to be remind of such.
---
You *could* do this and get 0 :D
---
is there a viable pvp mirage build around the new Sand Shards and Auspicious anguish? and possibly not taking CI, but chaotic persistence as the grandmaster trait
---
It's a joke.
---
On the flip side, since there's nothing cool out there that can't just be bought with gold (or at least has an enormous gold-sink component), *everything* ultimately boils down to a gold grind at some point.
---
Raid armor? Gifts of might and magic. Raid ring? Mystic tribute *and* funerary incense. Fractal, WvW, and sPvP backpacks? Gifts of fortune. Magnetite and gaeting can be cashed out for gold through the trading post, so everything you can buy with those has an opportunity cost. The only raid chair that isn't hideous (Dhuum) is also on TP, so even if you get it as a drop you spend the opportunity cost.
---
All of the really cool "hardcore" rewards force you to stop and grind gold at some point. Since *everything* equates to a huge gold cost, it feels like I can't work on *anything* without putting myself back. No point working towards Ad Infinitum because it'll set me back towards another set of raid armor. Can't use the new Peerless Infusions with all the gaeting I have stored up because *not* flipping them on TP puts me back from other goals.
---
None of my achievements matter because I can't afford to buy the rewards. Meanwhile the random half-afk casual who spams 1 runs around with raid infusions, the Dhuum chair, and a bunch of legendaries because he spent his time farming Istan while I pushed myself to improve at raiding.
---
I must be blind, but where is corsair armor set for season 4
---
there is headpiece, chest, leggings and boots
---
wtf they dont even look like any GW2 armor I know... they remind me of WoW armor.

I wouldn't call the festival shitty but FFXIV is really hot right now.

cool, more gemstore crap

Don’t drop the context, fam.  Everyone has to *start* somewhere.

your guild just hates you so much they decided to stop playing gw2 without telling you and that's why all of them are playing another game without you
---
duh
---
Balthazar’s too? Forgot about that. Well, they knew this would be a hit so they decided to be inconsistent and take the predatory approach like they did with the exalted shoulders even though the gloves were bought straight up. At least they’ve been consistently inconsistent this past year. If they’re this inconsistent with gemstore content and patch update windows it’s no wonder they had to have NcSoft step in and can have the team. Too many people in positions to make decisions that shouldn’t be, seemingly disorganized, and generally apathetic. Can’t even update Festival of the Four Winds to remove the cow that’s an obvious ode to Kralk and the rifts from last season, or any dialogue or the gauntlet bosses. Just change the hue of the gold on some sovereign weapons and toss them in. “Hey, guys, we did something, praise us! Now farm this for a month until we show you a glimpse of the next episode that will be coming with expansion level content like a new map, a mastery, and a two hour story chapter.”
---
&gt; I see that they actually focus more on **celestial looking items*, armors, infusions, dyes. Also we have druid with celestial form. 
---
Except that's a whole different topic probably coming from the gemshop and monetization teams.
---
There's games with a competitive PvE style in which things are 'first come, first served', like bosses that will only drop a thing once the first time they are killed, one of a kind unique drops impossible to replicate that drop only once per server, auction houses, PK and that kind of stuff.
---
GW2 is not one of them, and will never be one of them.
---
Drops are generic on purpose. In part so it's simpler to keep trading post data (a list of item IDs for predefined items with fixed instead auctions of individual items with random properties) and in part to keep things balanced, skill-based and fair.   
---
Everyone can easily see the max stats players can get, and it doesn't take ages to get them. Past max stats, it all depend on player skill, you can't grind or pay to get ahead.
---
Those last two festivals were still considered "lost forever" and everyone was like "I hope they bring them back" last year.
---
Or an asura insta fix
---
I would accept this comment if there was actually any engaging (and rewarding) content to participate in while not doing the annual event. That’s the difference between this game and the competition.
---
Not really. I got 2 or 3 sets of gear on most characters. I can swap those faster than these and despite that I rarely swap.
---
Even for the legendary weapons I rather swap between weapons than having to select the stat and then select the upgrades.
---
During Dragon Bash I was actually swapping out my sigil for the hologram slaying sigil. It is hard to see how repeating that experience is appealing especially when the UI for this makes it much worse.
---
Nendos are at least kinda cute, but Funkos are there in caricature territory. Yet both are way cheaper to produce since the base proportions are mostly unchanged, and they can sell more by inertia since they go well together, so no wonder companies are inclined to make these out of all the options.
---
Which is a pity since for many, collecting is about faithfulness and quality, not quantity, so the fans who're willing to pay the most likely won't buy these "abominations" anyway =/
---
The drama a few weeks ago were made-up from a streamer, who left GW2, and his fans. Another streamer said something what his fans got wrong and both's fans started to besiege this subreddit with tons of shit posts to stir up drama. 
---
The comment above is pretty similar (yet less extreme) to said made-up drama comments.
---
oh I see now after re-reading it; my bad
---
If your mouse comes with a mapping program you can use it for a combination like the one you mention, by putting some other key in there.
---
As long as it's one key -&gt; one action, it'll be allowed. 
---
Oh. And Dodge-jump is considered one action now for this.
---
I dont think that people have everything, only watching the unlock stats at gw2 efficiency one can do that conclusion. I thinl that people dont want rewarrds tied to only sink money or materials in huge proportions. 
---
But in the other hand, when anet put a nice collection or "quest" to the game people complain.
---
You can start spvp at level 3.
---
Such are the downfalls of *any* survey. 
---
Data is still relevant as long as you know how it was collected and from whom.
---
"My shitposts are facts mimimi"
---
They are not, they are shitposts and you know it. DeAl WiTh iT.
---
The 10 recipe and the 1 recipe have the exact same rng, but usually you want a given amount of clovers so using the 1 recipe means you'll go for around 10x more tries. Which means flatter gaussian.
---
In other words, the 1 recipe is if you want to know what it'll cost (3x as much materials as the number of clovers you need) and the 10 recipe is if you want to gamble (in the long run it's the same but in a single session it varies a lot more).
---
The skins come out with every update, and plenty of them. If they're not to your taste, that's not exactly the game's fault. Someone said the cash shop fills a gap between ingame rewards and legendaries, and I think there's truth to that, and I think there's a clientele that can't live with that. Who will forever bitch and moan about that gap. But Anet needs that gap to keep the servers running, so I don't really see a solution to that. People might actually just have to either accept that circumstance or move on. But as we all know, that's never going to happen. Neither of it.
---
two words: nostalgia goggles.
---
Actually, while we're at it, here's a couple custom GW2 Figma builds:

https://www.behance.net/gallery/58420817/Berserker-of-the-Shiverpeaks
---
BUT CONNNTENNNNT!!!!!!! REWARDSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
For a moment I really thought that Anet added a new Charr animation of their scratching their fleas.
---
Okay, so tell me what isn't a fact. Do you dispute that Shadowbringers is one of the most well recieved MMO expansions? Do you dispute that they just launched it? Do you dispute that FFXIV's content releases are consistent? Do you dispute that festival of the four winds is recurring? Do you dispute that the outfit is from a loot box?
---
I appreciate the effort in this post.
---
My biggest problem with rewards in the game is nothing I get from a drop or from achievements feels awesome. Why do they even bother giving us loot when all it ever is is junk that we will salvage to sell for gold that allows us to buy the actual game rewards? Just give us the materials and skip the salvaging step all together if you really want to make loot that boring.
---
What do you get from getting high achievement points? Mostly junk items and a small amount of gold. Unless you really like the 2 armor sets they made for achievements, there is hardly any rewards for having high achievement numbers.
---
I understand that Anet wants to limit the reliance on random drops for rewards. It sucks to get unlucky for ages as a player. But giving the players nothing but junk for loot and then giving them some amount of currency isn't the way to fix the problem. It just makes getting loot boring.
---
Grinding for gold so you can just buy what you want isn't interesting or rewarding.
---
Thanks for that insight.
---
The ONE guy working on it said it'll be a while. The ONE guy is trying his hardest. ONE guy.
---
While I recognize countries should be regulating them, it's also fairly scummy of the company to do it in the first place.
---
I was referring to the drama a few weeks ago. That *was* made-up drama from a streamer and his fans. They even changed the subreddit rules to prevent this kind of bashing even better. Don't call it fake, it's not.
---
&gt;any funko pop collectors?!
---
No, but I might start ...
---
If you consider yet another "kill 50 enemies of type x here", "press f 50 times here" events as interesting stuff to do... well
---
All I see is an upside down cart.
---
And opening the LFG in a festival map or  a map that is currently in festival mode should automatically open on the category corresponding to your current group size: 5, 10, or 50.
---
Same for living world maps. Go to Istan, open LFG, it would appear open at Istan by default. 
---
Many players open LFG categories and think they are ignore or do not work when they see them empty. So they do not make their own LFG, and it remains empty.   
---
So we could also use a 'nearby players' system for Story. You'd check a box in the LFG panel, and you would be put in a party with other players who also checked the box and who are in the same map doing the same story step as you.
---
&gt; What's going on?
---
*Looks around* I dont see anything
---
sHilL!
---
u/sim_souls
---
doesnt gw2 have countless sets of armour and weapons from the dungeons? you cooked mate? plus, armour sets in ff14 arent even comparable in quality and complexity with gw2's outfits, nevermind the mixing and matching or armour sets.
---
many veterans and end-game players are simply running out of things to do due to the long gaps between or entire lack of meaningful and engaging updates to end-game content, while carebears tell them to go play other games when they voice their concerns...
---
essentially that is nothing new, but this time a larger chunk of the game's playerbase came to that (accurate) realization, so carebears have a harder time drowning out these very valid concerns, causing in turn more people to become disillusioned.
---
it's a snowball effect that already started a very long time ago and is now turning into a more significant and relevant situation than ever (and even if it dies down again, it's only a matter of time until it resurfaces, unless ANet's behaviour significantly changes).
---
Gw2 is nothing different. Especially for hearts, which took the worst type of quests and made them even worse.
---
&gt; But Anet needs that gap to keep the servers running
---
How were game companies able to run their servers in the age before microtransactions? Servers did not become more expensive since then. This argument is a huge lie, spread to give people a reason to spend their money on overpriced cosmetics.
---
Dude I still remember that big boss overpowered all other paid character! Forgot the name but basically that boss was kinda a paid to kill and I was lucky enough KOed him so I got him!
---
This community has BEGGED for those festivals to be repeated yearly, and we've BEGGED for smaller events to fill in some of the between times
---
&gt; Okay, so tell me what isn't a fact. Do you dispute that Shadowbringers is one of the most well recieved MMO expansions? Do you dispute that they just launched it? Do you dispute that FFXIV's content releases are consistent? 
---
Yeah... absolutely offtopic, OP asked what's going on in *GW2*. You are just talking about the wrong game dude...
---
&gt; Do you dispute that festival of the four winds is recurring? Do you dispute that the outfit is from a loot box?
---
That's the point of annual events you know?... they come back yearly...
---
But Oh! I'M SORRY! I totally forgot about that outfit! Of Course People Stop Playing Because There Is An Outfit In The BLC! You're ridiculous. 
---
Let's change sides: What's about the **new** annual festival that we got a few weeks ago? What's about all the global events we get since months? What's about the new stuff we got only two days ago (I'm NOT talking about gemstore stuff obviously)? What's about the upcoming announcement event? What's about the fact that we currently have the highest content density since LS2?
---
You didn't tell the facts, you picked some bad points (and some made-up bad points) of the game, ignoring everything else and "compared" them to Random Game XYZ which is popular atm, to make the one game looking better than the other. Or in other words: Made-Up Drama / Shitpost.
---
PS. Forget everything I said before! It'S aLl BeCaUsE oF tHe OuTfIt!!!11! DeAl WiTh It!!
---
Seems I've hit a sore spot.
---
I used Jalis and Shiro for Leveling, both have a great sustained damage skill, Vengeful Hammers for Jalis, Impossible Odds for shiro. 
---
Vengeful Hammers is a decent AoE that Grant's damage reduction and heals a bit.
---
Impossible Odds gives you increased movement speed and makes all of you skills hit twice, increasing your damage significantly.
---
Keeping these skills active by switching legends are important to keep you alive, when you get your Trait unlocked, you'll have even more options that will help when switching Legends.
---
Players in a nutshell: Asking for content XY -&gt; getting content XY -&gt; complaining about content XY.
---
It's a testament to how much some players want endgame content that they're willing to do boring stuff in order to reach the end game content drip.
---
I guess people are willing to do repetitive content if there's something at the end of the tunnel. GW2 lost any reason to grind the festivals by giving them the exact same rewards year after year, which people have already gotten. The gold-gem based economy and shallow horizontal progression makes it difficult to string those players along.
---
For some reason the first thing that came to my mind seeing this was VooDoo Kingdom by SOUL'd OUT.
---
Yup
---
there are a lot of collections in pof and ls4 maps that award exotic gear. Maybe not the stats you want but they are "free"
---
Let me give you another perspective on the reward structure. My "endgame" is to unlock everything. Skins, Minis, Novelties whatever. If I wouldn't pursue this I would have stopped playing a long time ago because there is nothing else for me to do in the game. This includes accountbound stuff from Achievement rewards, PvP, WvW and Raids, so no, I'm not a casual at all. I stopped spending real money for gems years ago, just convert gold to gems and treat the gemstore as an ordinary vendor. I'm very methodical at this and get all the cheaper stuff first and don't really care how it looks.
---
I am now at a point that the most efficient way for me to unlock more stuff is to do whatever the best gold farm is at the moment (I hate farming so I don't actually do that), convert gold to gems, buy Black Lion keys in bulk and open Black Lion chests for Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocks and Black Lion Statuettes to buy more Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocks.
---
Let that sink in. **The cheapest way for me to get more rewards is a RNG loot box item. That sounds fun right?**
---
You can buy a gold key with the statuettes for a guaranteed uncommon or better but that cost 50 statuettes
---
[Snarky bastard.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Statuette) ;)
---
Yeah... too bad that this "shit" is exactly what player asked for for a long time. ;)
---
...are you aware that GW2 does not have a subscription fee?
---
Thanks xD
---
Pretty sure we've asked for new content that isn't just a reskin of "stand in the circle and press f" like, since HoT, so... Gonna go with a swing and a miss
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
This is my Personal Opinion™:
---
I generally feel the game has no 'meaningful PvE content' outside of raids, and most of the rewards are terrible for the following reasons.
---
- The rewards are just vastly inferior to Gem Store content, and the amount of work required to attain them is often extremely blown out of proportion. Lets look at my favourite example: the [Wayfarer's Henge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Wayfarer%27s_Henge). An obnoxious amount of time and money investment for what amounts to a backpack that is worse quality than a gemstore backpack. This is what those "nice collection[s] or 'quest[s]'" you are referring to in general. 
---
- Most of the content simply isn't *fun* or challenging in any way. 90% of the content added via Living Story is completely faceroll open world content that takes literally 0 brainpower to complete, and getting the rewards is equally faceroll and boring. You can finish the story in a few hours (at most) and then the map itself usually has minimal rewards that require a ton of grinding to actually obtain, like all of the Ascended Accessories.
---
- The actual cost for the quality of the things you are unlocking is completely fucked, and a lot of the time it feels like ANet is picking the costs to make some of this stuff out of a fucking hat. [Requiem Armor] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Requiem_armor) is the perfect example. The costs at launch were *fucking ludicrous*, on top of it being an extremely obnoxious collection, *on top* of it being a fucking ugly set of armor that looks like level 30 greens with glowy bits taped on.
---
&gt; Look at the "new" event, Dragon Bash. There was nothing special about it.
---
And yet it's something player asked for since LS1. You can't deny that annual festivals are popular. No matter how much you explain how boring or whatever it is, people like it and play it. Look around.
---
Problem with GW2 rewards for me is that the acquisition holds no meaning or achievement for me. I basically feel nothing when I make a legendary other than, oh this skin is quite nice.
---
The rewards are tedious and not fun or engaging to get, and the content that is fun and engaging for me has really bad, low effort, rewards I don't care for.
---
vs ~160 for an extra slot+20 slot bag
---
Grenades? I'm pretty sure everyone are weak to them.
---
Seems like a really cool project!
---
Check his post history people :^)
---
I know what you feel :(
---
I'm pretty certain that if people are contemplating these runes, they likely have maxed inventory slots on their main.
---
You might not think the bags are worth it - that's fine. They are still a better option than the legendary runes and sigils.
---
i see what you did there
---
I mean, there *are* new things every year, mostly skins. It's not like you do a festival one time and have nothing to do in the following years.
---
Superstitious non sense.
---
Hm, it seems to have a lot less features than my gw2 teamspeak3 bot, but you have 180 hours of coding on it and I've been coding mine for like 4 years lol. Anyway that bot seems cool. I hope you have fun with it!
---
Nah, your "arguments" are just so stupid and ridiculous that the most likely reason for this is that you are nothing more than a troll.
---
&gt; You don’t have a problem with the gem store? You must be a shill!
---
Really man? ANet has to make money somehow.
---
Yes, the direction of the game can be frustrating for some. But I’m willing to bet that a majority of the unhappy players haven’t even experienced half of the content of the game. If you enjoy exploration, story, and characters, the game has so much to offer.
---
It’s a shame that the various forms of gameplay are stretched so thin (mostly in regards to PvP and WvW), but of course the layoffs play a part in that. I’m sure that in an ideal world, ANet would be improving every part of the game, but there have to be compromises and concessions now.
---
(I actually make 50€/h, and no, you can't have my job!)
---
Very weak minded of people to play a game they enjoy when the other game they play is in a content lull /s
---
What is more weak minded is being unduly loyal to a particular game or company without being critical about it or focusing on your personal enjoyment of a game.
---
The in-game rewards have also grown stale.  
---
We've been collecting weapon, armor, backpiece, and armor skins for almost 7 years now. Most of us have what we are content with. They just don't have the same appeal as they used to.  
---
So what gains the players interest are newer things like glider and mount skins. The problem is that so much of that is locked behind the gemstore.
---
Reading comprehension...you lack it.
---
Oh, than you must have missed many updates. o.o
---
I would personally recommend the LW3-4 nodes bought with 50g and 10k magic (according to the LW season)-&gt; easy ascended trinkets every month or so..
---
Other nodes i would recommend are the HoT achievements nodes (check wiki)-&gt; lots of currency and occasional goods..
---
So what? Did GW1 have one?
---
You must have started gaming after the microtransaction-fraud became a thing
---
Funkos are literally a cancer to the figurine world, I see so many pretty figures but then the market is flooded with people who eat these bug eyed shits up
---
Yeah that is literally what recycling means.
---
Do they really like it? I only see "meh"
---
Well, they kinda committed to it being free when they stated it's living world.
---
Its a type of abuse i never want to feel again thats for sure. 
---
After 5 years thats pretty exceptional! Glad your robber maybe wasnt the brightest 😅
---
require PoF but otherwise free. 
---
also i don't think courage is the right word for that sentence.
---
I was just asking. I were offline last month
---
I have a really crazy idea for the first one. The team takes the minute or so of prep time to talk to each other instead just standing there wasting time.
---
Well...I'd say 3 tiers.  Otherwise queues would be a major problem.
---
Rood
---
I don't really mind it EXCEPT in those maps with horizontal layout and the spawn colors are reverse of the score board &gt;_&lt;
---
"Entire childhood".
---
I have been saying that for YEARSSSS. I didnt even know it was supposed to be a mine cart until like 3 months ago.
---
No? Nowhere did they ever claim that every single of episode of the Living World would always be free at release.
---
&gt;require PoF but otherwise free.
---
Source?
---
The game director has publicly stated they aren’t making any xpacs because “LS is working” it was in an interview right after they did the anniversary video last year. 
---
To think otherwise without any other indication is wishful thinking.
---
It is his hypothesis as per the OP
---
You would be surprised how easy it is to be reasonably good. Me and a few friends have been teaching many players how to use their griffons and our numbers have grown so much we are starting to create minigames that involve flying around
---
Quite pointless to speculate, since there is a grand total of no suggestion one way or another. Should have plenty of information in about a month though.
---
No idea why you were downvoted, Anet's lack of communication is legendary and your comment spot on.
---
You know that those only became a thing a bit before gw2 release, at the start of the microtransaction-fraud era? There was nothing like that for years.
---
If they want to monetize it in anyway tie it to the expansion or one of the expansions.
---
&gt;Do you think ArenaNet has the courage to make us buy a living world season?
---
They already do that if you miss the initial launch window, so yes. Question is how many people would buy it if it wasn't free at launch window. Then again 200 gems is not that much every 3+ months... we'll see.
---
&gt;They said season 5 will have expansion features.
---
No they didn't. They said they now have the tools and organization to *potentially* bring features with a LW episode that were associated with expansions only in the past.
---
You suck.
---
&gt; I say /u/hinawerdan
---
 is a shill because he is. I have had him flagged with RES for a year now because he consistantly shills so hard.
---
Oh, well in that case, I'll just take your word for it. /s
---
&gt; Its weird how other MMOs with cash shops tend to have actually meaningful content in game to work towards, yet somehow ANet consistently fails at this.
---
Other MMOs that are more popular, prominent, and profitable? Yeah, I bet they can put out more content.
---
&gt; Hell, Guild Wars 2 could literally have added a premium subscription for some content (extra bank, extra bag slots, some utility things, bonus gems each month, etc etc) and could have made a ton more money without encouraging constant MTX and gemstore skins.
---
Then people would just complain that they added a subscription.
---
&gt; The only reason I bother is because I love this stupid game, despite its flaws, and I hate how ANet constantly wastes their time on Gem Store Shit
---
I can generally agree with this, but again, ANet has to make money somehow. The gem store is their main source of profit. If they never added anything new, then people would just complain that they're recycling old skins and items.
---
&gt; instead of actually making the game fun and engaging for more than 10 hours every 4 months.
---
I see people say this all the time. If you finish a LW episode in 10 hours, then you're either rushing through it at an inhuman speed, or you're ignoring tons of content.
---
&gt; I have played every game mode, and PvP and WvW are just straight up unfun and unbalanced (PvP) or extremely boring zergfests (WvW) with no actual improvements made to them in months (or years for WvW).
---
I don't play PvP or WvW, so I can't comment on this. From what I have heard, however, what you say is true.
---
&gt; Open world PvE is a total fucking faceroll that requires 0 braincells or effort to complete. You just zerg everything.
---
GW2 has always been a casual game. I mean, difficulty is almost always just a matter of opinion.
---
&gt; Dungeons have been dead for years.
---
Can't argue with that.
---
&gt; Fractals get content so infrequently, and they havent gotten anything really challenging or fun in over a year now.
---
Frequency of content, again I can't argue with. Challenge and fun is still subjective.
---
&gt; Raids were great, except their release cadence is so fucking bad, and the newest raids don't provide any meaningful challenge outside of CMs, and those CMs only give you a reward once ever so nobody does them after their first time clearing it. They also have pretty shitty rewards.
---
See above comment.
---
&gt; "Exploration" isn't repeatable content, after you do it once on one character it becomes a chore on the next one.
---
I didn't say it was repeatable content. And by exploration, I don't mean map completion. I'm talking about events, NPCs, secret areas, special items. There are so many of these that there is no way that a single person has experienced EVERY piece of content.
---
Unelieveable how many features are straight up copies from GW2Bot. Shameful.
---
none since this is my guess since OP asked what ppl *think* it will be not what it will be
---
True.
---
If you go back far enough their original idea for content in the form of dungeons was buy to play.
---
Some people may not like it but frankly if it means they can pack more content and stuff we would expect from an expansion into living world then I wouldn't be against paying say $5 per episode.
---
So many good times. So many good ideas not implemented in 2.
---
Lol
---
Fair enough.
---
People like that ruin the game imo, it causes developers to cater to them at the cost of the majority. Its like fan service of the greedy kind, that cost the game by making less good ingame content and rewards. While scrambling to placate big spenders with crazy cosmetics at the expense of game content.
---
Imho some of this stuff dont even belong in the game, it looks out of place. We have a game that is a full on war of who can spend more to stand around LA looking best. Anet are too focused on shop and lootboxes. The soul of the game is disappearing, but i see this happening in all games. So sad that its come down to pandering to the few.
---
Alternatively, an option to always be Red, and enemies are Blue. Dirty Blues.
---
Wow. What a long post that adds literally nothing to the discussion.
---
&gt;Oh, well in that case, I'll just take your word for it. /s
---
Click his name. Read through his post history for 5 minutes. He goes into every single thread discussing ANet and shills. Negative thread? Defends everything ANet does. Positive thread? Posts about how everyone who has issues with the game is whining and complaining about nothing.
---
&gt;Other MMOs that are more popular, prominent, and profitable? Yeah, I bet they can put out more content.
---
Have you considered *why* this might be the case? Cause Guildwars 2 sold really well at launch, and then fell off a cliff from lack of meaningful content updates for what, years? Living Story Season 1 was extremely low on actual content, and the only endgame was dungeons. A large number of the games players bled off after they realized how boring WvW got, and how lacking in content PvE was after you farmed up your dungeon sets.
---
&gt;Then people would just complain that they added a subscription.
---
You mean an *optional* subscription. Because people sure don't complaing about the current subscription model at all, but adding more options sounds like a shitty idea. That makes sense. /s
---
&gt;I see people say this all the time. If you finish a LW episode in 10 hours, then you're either rushing through it at an inhuman speed, or you're ignoring tons of content.
---
Its not even rushing, its just that the majority of the rewards added with each LS Chapter are completely useless for people who have been playing a long time (oh boy, more ascended accessories!) or have extreme levels of time sink for shitty rewards, or don't actually take long (Beetle/Skyscale). The story itself, even when Im not rushing, only takes a few hours. Maybe if you are bad at the game and don't actually know how to DPS then the story will take time, but even the "hardest" encounters in the story for me take a few minutes at most. Calling this "inhuman speed" is extreme hyperbole.
---
&gt;GW2 has always been a casual game. I mean, difficulty is almost always just a matter of opinion.
---
Have you ever considered that GW2 being so casual-focused leads to having content that doesn't meaningfully challenge people, and leads to people not being retained?
---
&gt;Frequency of content, again I can't argue with. Challenge and fun is still subjective.
---
This isn't really subjective. The fractal community as a whole has panned the last few fractals added, and none of them had any particularly challenging bosses or encounters. They were mostly trash mobs, and completely lacked challenge motes.
---
&gt;See above comment.
---
Also not subjective, sorry. The newest raids and undeniably easier than Wing 5. ANet has admitted that the difficulty of Wing 5 was a mistake, despite it being one of the most enjoyable raids they have ever released challenge-wise.
---
&gt;I didn't say it was repeatable content. And by exploration, I don't mean map completion. I'm talking about events, NPCs, secret areas, special items. There are so many of these that there is no way that a single person has experienced EVERY piece of content.
---
Great. Most of this isn't meaningful or rewarding content. The grand majority of events in this game are completely worthless as far as rewards for time investment goes, secret areas are nice for a few seconds of novelty, and these 'special items' are either memes like the Harpy Pheromones, or are completely useless. Not every person has experienced "EVERY piece of content" but that doesn't magically make the content worth experiencing for the grand majority of the playerbase. I would go as far as saying that 90+% of the playerbase doesn't give a shit about this category at all.
---
Uhh I think you have that backwards friend.  Do you actually play WvW?  Because if you don't, then the valid criticism probably seems like endless whining.  Have you considered this "whining" sounds endless because Anet never actually addresses these concerns?  Therefore people are complaining about the same things they were complaining about years ago.
---
Do not
---
lmfao
---
I too have been hoping for some more PvP oriented griffon activities. Or even just more griffon activities for pve events . 
---
Would be really awesome if for some open world pve events griffon riders need to drop bombs on certain mobs or elixers on allies like the ballistas for tequatle while maintaining altitude and avoiding Arial obstacles like the magic circles in bloodstone fen.
---
OR IN WVW as a fighter/bomber. Fight for resources to get the griffon. Landing in enemy territory's or outside of specific areas and you Insta die to prevent exploitation. Easily adds a whole new element to wvw . perhaps anti air elements as well with changes to the ballista and arrow cart. Shield generator more needed to defend against Arial bombardment/ also having a air force of your own. 
---
PvP oriented game modes would be awesome as well. Just need to give the players a missile skill they can shoot that moves 10%faster than the griffon that knocks players off their griffon. Can use that for really any game mode like team deathmatch or capture the flag. Just need enough obstacles for the griffon to use as cover.
---
Really the potential is limitless. So far me and a few guildies have been doing a few griffon minigames with the targeting mechanic for "tagging" player's and squad markers for objectives like flag locations with discord to call out stuff. Really fun with even only 2-3 on each team. Can't wait for more members to play with.
---
Still I do hope anet sees the potential even though griffon flying is only seen as a small novelty niche in the game.
---
I actually prefer the news ways we've seen to have 'optional paths' in living world.
---
* In-mission paths like the choices in the first two missions of HoT. 
---
 * Unfortunately it looks like they ran out of time and couldn't do more of those. 
---
* Bonus optional actions or small changes based on profession, like how in Confessor's End a thief could pick the door lock or a ranger could tame an enemy dog, and a necromancer take over enemy summoned skeletons. 
---
 * They didn't do this again for a horridly long time, but they remembered it in The Hero of Istan, and different professions could escape using different methods when imprisoned in Istan. 
---
* Alternative methods, like how you can get Taimi to control the waypoint device in Recalibrating the Waypoints, or how you can skip puzzles and fight enemies instead in several missions, if you are not feeling brainy that day. 
---
In personal story you make the choices with a boorish way, a dialog option at the end. Almost as an afterthough. Since it takes 10 levels t get to the next story stage, you may even have forgotten your choice when you get back to the story. 
---
By putting the choices mid-mission, you can reset the mission and pick a different thing, or try different options, or replay for achievements, without having to replay the whole story, and you get to see the consequences right away.
---
It feels more like good ol' Baldur's Gate style this way, with the choices on the spot, letting you pick different methods to achieve the same goal, without requiring the devs to make way more content that players may see only once per choice.
---
If we merely take the number of squads doing the Crown Pavillion, then no, it's way less popular, there is just a fraction of the squads we had last year. That being said, maybe most people are just burnt out by the continuous recycling of festivities, and/or on vacation, and/or rather doing other stuff, and/or asking themselves why ANet didn't add a few nice new rewards for this year's Festival.  
---
That being said, there's a still a certain amount of squads, so there's at least some people, so it still seems to be somewhat popular at least!
---
If it has new elite specs then I would expect a $10-15 pricetag.
---
Can you chat with her in-game from the Discord in-game UI?
---
Well... its been 540 days or so since it was announced, I wonder how many people have quit the game since then because of the lack of communication and / or development in WvW, and how many people will be gone by the time they release it, if they ever do so.
---
Looks like an overhaul that is too big too late, its not that some of us (speaking for just 25 people in my Guild) don't like the game or rage quit because of balance issues, lots of us just gave up and stopped caring. For example, I used to spend hours playing in WvW after work, both zerging and solo roaming, about a year ago I started logging in, playing WvW for about 30 mins, collect TP sells and play something else since in NA T1 sometimes it takes me about 30 minutes to find someone else while roaming.
---
Yes, the MMO genre isn't what it used to, yup we get it, granted, it's a business and you need money, yup agreed, but you have to give the community something to keep them interested, give us some sort of hope that something is actually on the works at HQ, at least a very small feature that shows you still care Anet. So far, all you've shown is that Raiders are important to you and new players, WvW and Spvp are sadly a consequence of bad planning, terrible execution, and a balance team that in any other company I'm pretty sure would've gotten laid off years ago.
---
Shame really, I love the game more than you like money Anet.
---
Literally what does that have anything to do with what I said?  Sure some classes benefit more than others, but having seperate sets of ascended armor is just better in terms of speed of swapping gear, and per gold, buying bag slots and upgrading to 32 slot bags is cheaper than any inventory legendary saves you (until you hit the crossover threshold which is near 30 builds).
---
please don't fix it. :D
---
Yeah it does feel like WvW is at a tipping point right now in NA at least.  If there is no big news or delivery on Anet's part soon, I would not be surprised if the game is just dead in 6 months.  Other than the ktrainers/gift of battle farmers.
---
Skins and Minis. Can't forget all the character and monster models shrunk down to 1/10th their size and added to a vendor. High value content! /s
---
All the interesting content is in the gem store. Mount skins, fun toy gimmick items, gliders, etc. I think the only actually interesting item that they added with a LS Chapter was that teleport-item that let you set a point and return to it... too bad they just dumped it into a vendor instead of doing something interesting with it, meaning you just grinded up X Currency and got it. Such meaningful content! /s
---
Human female meta is pretty close to anime
---
&gt; We love the game as much as you do even when our origins differ.
---
Right. And how do our origins differ exactly? I also played Gw1 when it was current. I liked it too. I like Gw2 more. I also play for than 3 hours as if that matters in any way. Stop pretending that you are some sort of spokesperson for the Gw1 or even the non casual community. You absolutely do not speak for me.
---
It's fine if you liked Gw1 more. But like I said to the other guy: It has been 7 years. Get the fuck over it.
---
Most likely it will be "Free if you log in when an episode is active" just like the rest, they will probably tie it to pof
---
0 day acc OmegaLUL
---
&gt; Based on this, pretty much the only rewards I got in the last 4 years (which is basically the timeframe of this list) have been upgrades to power: some ascended crap and some masteries.
---
...I don't understand, I just listed many dozen total items that have nothing to do with power increases.
---
Why I don't understand this Elite Specs need to be behind a paywall whether its an expansion or not. Why do elite specs need a paywall.
---
worked like a charm, thanks!
---
&gt; I honestly was expecting a second table with all the gem-store content released during the same period.
---
Definitely thought about it, but I put too much time into this as it was. Wiki is NOT set up to make searching for this info easy or organized. 
---
&gt; If you add everything, it's completely legit that some people is angry, bored or just hopeless, not because of the amount of released content, but because of the way it has been released.
---
Oh, sure, I never meant to imply there's no reason to complain. I've just seen one too many commenters repeating, "if they can't sell it in the gem store, we don't get it," lately.
---
No.
---
You are the one who claims ArenaNet updates the Gem Store content more than they update in-game content.
---
Prove that.
---
You couldn't assign directly Mouse Wheel Up or Down if I remember right in GW2.
---
But you could bypass that with Software that are compatible with your mouse. You just need to remap your Mouse Wheel Up and Down to keybinds that GW2 could use and assign those keys in GW2.
---
People want *open field* fights.  Sustaining through siege from 15 different sources is not a fight.  If a server is trying to avoid fighting you, hitting their keep or garri is one of the few ways to hopefully draw them out.  The idea isn't to take the keep.  Usually what happens is you get sieged/clouded for 20 minutes with little to no progress, then you back out of the objective and hope the other side actually has a tag and comes out to fight you.
---
&gt; I'm still wondering where OP got that number from and what hellsiege experiences he's been through.
---
Obviously 5 hours is an exaggeration, but have you ever tried to take T3 smc with full supply, cloaking waters, airship and 3rd floor siege everywhere?  Talk about hellsiege....
---
A lot of work is being/has been done and they are working hard on it!
---
Or at least that's what the devs keep telling us but for all we know its not coming any time soon if at all (likely not at all).
---
And at this point it doesnt matter. NA scene is dead and alliances are not going to save it.
---
Hard to get an understandable reply? What do you not understand? Why didnt you tell anyone? What is not really clear? When did the bot show you false things? Everything related to false information is due to the GW2API. Don't you even see that even the commands are named identically? That he asked us on how often we do our guildsync?
---
same.  I can't jump right at all without our coyote time.
---
Yeah... I would love to enjoy spvp/WvW like I used to before the stagnation grew but I just don’t have much hope for it to change at this point.
---
Easy.
---
Look at the amount of items released in the gem store.
---
Compare that to the content released IG for unlocking through gameplay.
---
Done.
---
I know the legendary weapon release schedule turned to sludge, but I'd love to see legendary weapon quests come back. 
---
Those gave a nice sense of accomplishment(TM) while actually making you go out and do things thematically related to the weapons. Much more fun than the elder wood/mithril gold sinks we've got right now.
---
Man, I haven't PvPed in so long that I completely forgot how the lack of this bothered me.
---
And man, remember how long we had to beg for A.Net to add universal character models and then they still refused to add it to QM.
---
These guys really struggle with the basics of this game.
---
[deleted]
---
Do you use the 10 recipe or the 1 recipe? After 1150 1x tries I have 29.9% chance
---
Wait u srs?  
---
He produced information in a clear manner, similar to that of a table.
---
You gonna tell me that GW2Bot copied my design from 4th grade when i started using excel?  
---
Also commans like !!account !!bosskills !!wallet etc. are literally the names for the information they provide. Why would you even consider changing up such basic features just to be unique?  
---
At least Aleevas website doesn't look like my first homepage kit with a fat donate button.
---
I actually really like the idea of having to unlock stat selections.  Similar to how LS2 stat trinkets couldn't be bought unless you unlocked them before (of course legendary equipment has always bypassed it too).  I'd prefer it be from achievements (similar to LS2) rather than currency, but still would love if that were implemented.
---
However they wont retroactively add these which means only future stats would be effected and that would end up being inconsistent.  So I doubt anything will be done regarding this even for future content.
---
Or maybe you can just play the game and not expect things to be handed for essentially for free, there are three game modes where you can get legendary armor literally just choose one
---
How the hell you running at 60fps?
---
So you only gear swap with legendaries ? Besides why instantly thinking about Anet making something for a certain part of the community, everyone can use build templates but I guess crying about it is easier.
---
I forgot that Anet never wins, even when good things are being planned.
---
I think you are just looking at this from a different point of view.  Most of the time when people say they want fights, they mean open field fights, not sitting in siege.  You know, where you can use coordination to outplay or outmaneuver another similarly-sized group. So it's a more zerg-oriented view.  Whereas if you are a pug with no tag, then repelling an enemy zerg from your structure with siege and picking off their stragglers is as close to a "fight" as you're going to get.  
---
If you are the pug in that case, the clash was good content for you.  Otherwise you'd probably be semi-afk or roaming since there is no tag anyway.  From the zerg's point of view, that is just wasted time since they actually didn't get what they wanted from it.  
---
You were close to the truth when you said WvWers don't know what they want.  The truth is that people play the game mode in different ways for different reasons.  It's generally not simply individual players being hypocritical.
---
&gt; If we merely take the number of squads doing the Crown Pavillion, then no, it's way less popular, there is just a fraction of the squads we had last year. 
---
Of course there is. Last year the festival reopened after a very long time again, so it was new for a lot of people and even the old veterans wanted to play it again. This year, this is totally different. Everyone who was there last year and did all/most of the stuff already has now a lot less incentive to participate. Seeing way fewer people there is just normal in this case. They just prefer to do other things in-game instead.
---
Well you could have literally taken ANY OTHER DISCORD BOT as inspiration. For example you know, jeeves.bot.  
---
Just because you were the first doesn't mean you have to right to shittalk others.  
---
Kinda funny that you are open source but as soon as somone comes along with something similar you throw a hissyfit.
---
Our server in T2 and we have no queues outside of Reset, and even reset queues die down within an hour.
---
During the week only EBG ever get a queue and that is ONLY because that is the only map that has some action on it..... the other maps are basically a ktrain to small havoc groups cause no one cares to defend anything anymore.
---
I frequent this sub while i shit quite regulary.  
---
And i've been using Aleevabot for quite a while now (betatester) and I haven't had any issues so far. So yeah, not a friend but someone that likes the bot.
---
And as I said, pretty much the only rewards I ended up spending time on have been increases to power. Grinding vanity makes sense if you enjoy the proces of if you enjoy the vanity itself: grinding power, on the other hand, objectively makes your character better.
---
tl:dr. I want legendary armor without having to do more than open world.
---
PMA almost exclusively runs private with 15-25 outside of when facing entire map queues. Even then, Nal avoids public tagging.
---
How are people selling those mote things on the TP? 
---
Wiki says they come from the satchels,  which you have to donate crystals to get. 
---
Where do we get the satchels of loot from?
---
Edit. nvm.  I see you said you needed to buy 3 to get one satchel.
---
LOL good one.  He literally runs like 16 hours every weekend with 50/50 squad.
---
FF14 is better than Gw2, its not even close dude
---
It's similar on my server.  I'm just saying 1 tier is 25% of the capacity as we currently have for players.  It's gonna end up being queue hell, and will make things extremely difficult for guilds who want to get all their members into a map.
---
Redditor for 2 hours, and only to post in this thread? Interesting.
---
Well, from the start, I can see that settings are changed via the emoji tabs.
---
Rather than having to type in everything, you click the emoji that corresponds with the selection. That's already a change by adding a GUI of sorts, rather than relying on command line arguments.
---
Haven't gotten much further than that yet.
---
Yeah I'm going to go ahead and remove this, I agree with multiple other users that this appears to be a complete rip off of GW2Bot and there is obvious astroturfing going on.
---
I'm all for competition and more apps but ripping off another creation and astroturfing in the comments are not okay.
---
Awwww shieeeeet, he used a template. Lets lynch him.  
---
Doesn't change the fact that the website looks way better than the other one.  
---
Also if you consider squarespace in the same league as some homepage kit... Boy do I have some news for you.
---
Swap out staff for hammer though if your new. The range helps a lot.
---
You look at the game, it has no logic.
---
1. Get your first mount by starting the first chapter of the Path of Fire story. Check your mail inbox, or if you aren't getting the mail, try loading into Lion's Arch first.  
---
2. You get Hero Points by doing Hero Point objects in Path of Fire maps (or HoT if/when you get that, all HP are interchangeable).  
---
3. Level your relevant crafting disciplines to 500. Use https://gw2crafts.net/ to find the cheapest way to get to 500. Then start crafting your daily crafting time gates every day. The Ascended Weapon recipes would have to be purchased elsewhere. You can check the wiki to see where to get the recipes. You can also get free Ascended Weapons from completing your Elite Specialization collection. You have a Weaver, which means if you finished the Weaver Elite Spec Collection you get a free stat-selectable (limited choices) Ascended Sword.
---
Because the LFG is a goddamn mess. Festivals should be on top, and all the categories inside open world should be divided in sections by expansion/season.
---
Pretty much any company ever exploits any loophole they can get away with. Look at data privacy in the us, or borderline slavery in China. 
---
I agree with you but that is rarely how it works in practice
---
As someone who did a lot of development, saying the commands have the same name is not really good argument to say it is copied from another program.
---
Good developers will always use the most explicit and obvious names for stuff. So if you want a command to show you your raid boss kills for the week, the command will likely be 'raidbosses' or something on that line. Honestly, if someone creates a bot with non-obvious commands just to make it "unique", I wouldn't use that bot because I wouldn't trust its developers are qualified to make a good software.
---
On top of that, any decent developer will, in fact, copy command names from more popular softwares if they share the same purpose. You want to know why? Because one of the goals of software developing is making it user-friendly. Why in the world would I create something unique if it's only causing discomfort in my users?
---
Want to know the easiest example of what I'm saying?
---
Take your cellphone's apps and count how many of them have a menu button on the top left corner. Also, any new app you download, you intuitively know where to go to access its menu. And I guarantee you, if someone made an app with a different layout, there would be tons of complaints about how people can't find the menu button
---
But muh sjw points. 
---
Nothing more satisfying than listening to their love bickering when a god of fire and war is coming over to fuck everyone up.
---
Yes, I am not interested in games where I grind for power. And since power has been the only reward in the last four years that I found relevant (because, once again, power is objectively better than an ugly hat), I haven't been much interested in GW2.
---
I tried my best to be sarcastic, sorry it didn't worked as expected. Eot.
---
&gt; I'm all for competition and more apps but ripping off another creation
---
So what you are saying is, that because it has similar features to GW2 Bot its automatically a rip off?  
---
I guess this was my last day on this sub then, because i wholeheartly disagree with that comment.  
---
And to say that its total rip off when we know nothing of the codebase is just straight up slander, but hey I guess it's reddit so it's ok.
---
They could cost things in a way where getting everything available for swaps is akin to the cost of legendary gear. It would still let people build their way there.
---
There's an economy balance side to this idea that I'm not really going to touch because only ANet knows the parameters involved.
---
Bruh. The war is over. It's time to collect your mates and leave the battleground.
---
In order:
---
1.) Continue the Path of Fire story to unlock mounts (in between Rapyor and Springer, you'll need to do events in the desert area to level up your Raptor mastery until you can jump farther distances)
---
2.) More Dps would come from berserkers equipment.  You can buy lvl 80 berserkers equipment from the Trading Post, including an exotic weapon.  Both of those things will need some gold though (maybe 15g max for all?)
---
3.) You'll have to wait on ascended equipment since it's fairly expensive per piece, especially since you need your articifer skill up.  You can technically get an ascended  weapon as a drop (my first ascended wep was an assassin staff when I was on my main character, also an ele), but it's rare and unlikely in the short term.  Exotic should be fine for now.
---
I wish you luck! Elementalist is fun and i still play Staff Tempest to this day.
---
Nope, sorry. Last time my other account here was tracked I got spammed by RMT mails and I fought for 3 months to unlock my not-really-lost-forever account.
---
People who have religiously been running Fractals daily will have a lot of extra boxes. Most of the player base won't.
---
I personally have enough boxes around for an extra armor set or two. My point still stands though, it's not worth using those boxes for a stat spread that is merely interesting. Even if I do so, then it's annoying to have to manage gear sets in my inventory.
---
sigh, yeah...
---
I'd just really like to do more quests with her you know.
---
I don't think I could ever get tired of having her as a companion for quests or someone with such a beautiful mind.
---
Well, I suppose there is a reason why the code is private. I mean if I ripped someone elses work, I wouldn't want someone else to rip off my work as well.
---
To be fair, if devs decide to dig into Season 2 storyline which had some unique dialogue for charr and human players (which I've written about at length in [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5oytnd/roxs_secret/) with cited sources), we may see Rox's past return to haunt her.
---
Back in Season 2's Camp Resolve instances as a charr Commander we caught Rox lying to us (but only if we were charr as we were familiar with charr military rules and noticed something amiss in Rox's explanation which she quickly brushed over) and could intimidate Rox's shady associate who was forced to reveal his name as [Monti Scythescrape](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Monti_Scythescrape). What was curious about charr Commander's comment on Monti was the fact that we as charr didn't recognize Monti's gear as belonging to either the Legions or the Orders even though in game Monti was wearing red charr cultural armor which suggests Blood Legion affiliation.
---
The questions from that time are still unanswered:
---
1) Who exactly is Monti Scythescrape (who is openly hostile towards the Commander), what is his relation to Rox, and why are both of them evasive about it when questioned? Why was he not dressed as a legion officer should? Is he a member of the Legions, a potential undercover agent not wanting to draw attention to himself, or representative of a third party not related to the Legions?  
---
2) Why did Rox feel the need to lie to us, the Commander, even if we were a charr Commander who canonically have centurion rank in our chosen Legion? What is so secretive that even a close ally and "boss" of Dragon's Watch can't know about it? (This seems to echo Rytlock not being allowed to tell us whatever happened behind closed doors during his tribunal in the Citadel which led to his rank being reinstated, so perhaps Rox's mission is similar and it's only for the ears of tribunes or imperators)  
---
3) There were hints that Rox was very curious about our whole egg hunt mission as well inquiring us if Rytlock had returned from the Mists, and she kinda slipped that she may have been spying on someone for someone in the Iron Imperator's office. Was Rox spying on us, or someone else?  
---
4) Who exactly was Rox working for in the Iron Imperator's office (as it seems Monti may also be aware of her side assignment and thus might be yet another spy associate if we go with this line of thinking)? Did Iron Imperator Smodur recruit her while she was a free agent, or could Rox have been working for Blood Imperator Bangar who would no doubt want to keep an eye on both Smodur's activities as well as whatever the Pact Commander was doing since Rytlock's disappearance?  
---
If the devs ever decided to expand on Rox's shady past and secret agent mission, Monti's relation to her and his role in this mess, and if Bangar is in any way involved as well (as the dev replies in the Q&amp;A thread also seemed to suggest that Rytlock being demoted, arrested, questioned in the Black Citadel for his Mist trip, and eventually being reinstated as tribune was not in Smodur's hands but seemed to have been requested by Bangar as Rytlock is his officer and not Smodur's), Monti may yet return to drag Rox back into Blood Legion business...assuming that this subplot from Season 2 hasn't been forgotten as it was admittedly even more obscure than the Krytan royal locket stuff.
---
Even if Rox is a gladium/free agent/new member of the Olmakhan now, she may still hold crucial intel (as suggested by her [unfinished report found in Atholma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unfinished_Field_Report) for the skyscale collection where she recalled previous reports written for Rytlock and someone else) that Bangar is after, and he may use underhanded means to pry that information out of Rox with or without her and the Olmakhan's blessing.
---
I look forward to finding out if this Monti plot gets addressed in the future and if we learn more about Rox's secret mission from back then. :)
---
well, foremost there is no communication. do you know how they react to areana net partners when they would like to include a dev into their stream or make a video about some topic in general?  
---
firstly, they go directly: no, we do not do that, that would introduce "favoritism". so whatever you are going to do, you will never get to interact with any anet dev in a deeper way...because they are going to get some nice words from their bosses if they find out.    
---
you know what partner from warframe sometimes do. visiting DE and make videos about it.  
---
second, any interview is completly restricted. anet devs will never ever answer any question that is not worked out from before...that goes so far that "user questions" in their "streams" get preproduced.  
---
if you want an "interview" you have to work out any question beforehand, send the whole script to them and they will descide on anything. if there is a question which they do not like, you can't say in the interview: they didn't answer that. you have to exlude that else you can't get that shit out.  
---
anything in arenanet including any information is heavily restricted and nothing can go out before the top descides that this information can get out.  
---
communication is already scewed from their side, how can some user have a healthy discussion when they are so restricted?  
---
also, just to show it to you again: see that HD texture outcry from the new outfit VS the celestial infusion which is blurry AF? that has been communicated from us since infusion release day 1. apparently no one got ever word on or this shit already starts at internal communication.  
---
how we know of this? anet partners and several other sources.  
---
this is a topic since years btw. and nothing changed. i am not the first one who said this, i won't be the last one. anet changed a lot since the release of guild wars 1...and yes, i am a fan of their games since then. that doesn't mean i won't voice critiscism.   
---
forums: look at all the complains on reddit about this topic. i am not going to write another wall of text regardning this.  
---
if you say my criticism is toxic, then yes, you are toxic and not me. you fall under the same people who go: "then play another game if you do not like it".
---
I’ve been wanting to get Living World season 3 but haven’t seen it on the gem store. Do they only put it up for a limited time every so often?
---
Looking at other comments it will be an unpopular opinion. But I don't understand what's the big deal? I play other games like LoL and you pretty much can get either side with either colour. 
---
Personally this has never bothered me. I know the map, I know what colour I am playing for and I can see the mini map for my team and kill info with the colour. It's not even a thing to remember. 
---
And to add it will be boring playing same side with same map structure all the time.
---
honestly i don't care about any of this, and most of the playerbase does not as well. lets be real, we won't repeat those stories just like barely anyone replays the living story episodes, story IS NOT impactful content as devs would want it to be.  
---
focus on the other areas in game instead like instanced content, pvp and wvw and do something for the veteran players
---
I think I understand it...you just press flap whole diving for a speed boost, right? I have been doing that.
---
It's good to not assume and to also look at things in a broader view.  I have 4 complete suits, so far, of legendary armor and will get legendary runes for at least one set and legendary sigils for several weapons.  For the others, I'll continue to use my endless extractor and one of my guild banks devoted to carry most runes and sigils in the game.
---
But you see, I'm discussing beyond myself but for the game overall.  Even if you and I (and all your friends) have all legendary armor, weapons, trinkets, runes, and sigils, that is not the majority though you might feel like you are.  
---
If you check the posts for legendary runes already made, most agree that most players will never decide to spend 3000 gold for one set of legendary runes.  Why create systems and content that are very limited for the majority of the playerbase?  Build templates to be fully utilized, you need all legendary.
---
Your argument really is flawed in so many aspects, it's difficult to know where to start.  GW2 when released did not allow easy, free respec of your traits as of course all of us vets who played since beta know. But they changed it so it was.  Why?  Because being able to change your builds easily was seen as an important feature.  Players would not change their traits around freely if everytime they had to pay to do so.  
---
It's true that many people just follow what others tell them to play whether it's Metabattle, SC, or others.  But that doesn't come magically to them.  They actually experiment and find what works best and then other people just copy them.  And what they determine is not the final word if you are an experienced player capable of actually making and modifying your own builds.  
---
Being able to change freely between all those should be encouraged.  The only way to do that in full is with legendary, hence why I have it.  But again, most don't.  Being able to change your build should be something you can throughout.  Back in the days of GW2 release, I had a blast soloing everything and changing builds on the fly.  I'd encounter dungeons and actual champs (like the fire elemental before it's nerf) where to succeed in soloing, I had to get creative and change my build considerably.  Back then, it was easy considering there were so few changes compared today.  I could literally carry every combination.  That made the game a great deal of fun and challenging (this is of course before power creep).  And always, in WvW, I often get the advantage by simply creating builds most people overlook and by easily countering people who follow standard builds.  And equipment and flexibility is a big part of doing that.
---
Players should not be assigned to only being allowed to play a very limited amount of builds because they're not rich and don't have legendary everything.
---
I understand if you want your expensive things to try to show off to others.  But take legendary weapons, way back they had NOTHING to offer but cosmetics and many people happily went for that.  If you want pretty things and to show off, get those.  But basic thing like your own character build shouldn't be tied.
---
Using your own argument, I assume of course you'd also be fine if  build templates cost 100 gold on each use.  If you play the game, you'll get the money for that and you should not expect to be handed that for essentially for free.  Hopefully you can see the sarcasm in that.
---
In any case, the OP suggests a method where you are indeed actually working to unlock things.  (You know like we already have with cosmetic if you actually play the game?) You're actually investing and like he said, it means when new stat combos are created, you need to actually, you know, play the game to get it, instead of just right clicking and choosing it with legendary armor.
---
You can still have legendary runes that give you cosmetic stuff and people will go get them still just like infusions.  
---
I am also assuming, of course, based on your argument that you greatly oppose the system we have for unlocking skins in the game and oppose the wardrobe system.  It's the same principle.  Except that's silly cosmetic stuff, not actually important things like your build.
---
Haha I have tried it about 10 times already. I am so bad about running into things or aiming wrong and losing a lot of momentum.
---
Heyyy let's all ask Microsoft to make their code public... 
---
Some people don't want their code public its simple as that, but this sub has a rage boner against private code. The same thing happend with the dx11 thread. He was witchhunted for having his code private that he wrote in his free time. I would not be surprised if people stop developing shit for gw2 just given the reactions something new comes along and it's not 100% innovativ an open source.
---
The last frame is perfect
---
it should always be there, check in your hero panel under the story tab. You can navigate to buying season 3 from there I believe
---
I thought I was the only one that found the decision to remove the post strange. The astroturfing stuff could be real, though, but removing the whole post is overreacting.
---
That is a legit dev quote fwiw.
---
this doesn't clarify if you did all the hero points or consumed them from WvW tokens; unfortunately.
---
Not to mention the only Ranged option for Base Rev, which helps in World Boss events
---
Give it sometime.  Mine took about 30 minutes to come off.
---
Well, if you only read a part of my comment and conjure the rest out of thin air, I guess this is the conclusion you will get.
---
I didn't use anything, I completed the map normally.
---
maybe not a complete ripoff, looks like it has some DPS log functionality?  sorta?
---
Oh, I took that to mean, "should you HAVE to spend money on gems"... as in, "should the only way to obtain gems be with real money"
---
GW2Bot has that in the works if ya want. I'll make a post with all the recent features soon or you can keep up to date on our server.
---
X: Doubt
---
Both can coexists. 
---
It would be possible to have have stats and upgrades unlocked over time, while keeping  legendary gear that gets all stats and upgrades with a single upfront cost.  
---
Legendary gear would still have all stats available for no additional cost, and any new stats and upgrades available automatically as they are introduced with no extra time investment, and of course unique legendary visuals. That would keep legendary gear legendary, while those using exotics and acended would have to unlock the stats beforehand, and keep paying every time they want to swap, but at least still have access to a similar QoL feature.  
---
And if the overall cost would be smaller for making a legendary if one were to unlock every single stat and upgrade, and legendary had a way to craft cheaper 'replicas' of legendary gear out of Ascended once the original has been unlocked for the account, so the account doesn't have to constantly move items between characters, that would still keep legendary a desirable alternative over just sticking with progressive unlocks, specially for those who enjoy testing builds after updates.   
---
We can already change stats in ascended, so the change to unlocked stats would be more of  change to get a single consistent and uniform system for both legendary gear and other gear, making templates more serviceable.
---
&gt; Oh, what ascended trinkets are given for logging in? I must have missed that!
---
Heh. [All core amulets and rings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Laurel_Merchant) for starters. Accessories too, if you want to spend a bit more gold in the form of 100 ectos, which comes to like 25g right now for a set of two, so two weeks of dailies at most, or an hour of a nominally profitable farm. Plus, as I said, all trinkets have multiple map currencies that you can earn through Season 3 and 4 to get full ascended trinkets of any stats.
---
&gt; As for armour, I think I am at around t60 in fractals and the only piece of ascended gear that I have seen dropped has been one of the pieces from the Wurn in Bloodtide.
---
Notice how you don't need ascended armor yet at T3. The drops pick up in T4, plus you can use your fractal relics to help buy them for reduced cost (and you get tons of gold from fractals, so that shouldn't be a problem either). 
---
&gt; I honestly do not understand your defensiveness: as I said, I looked over the list of rewards you made and said that I am starting to understand quite clearly why I lost so much interest in GW2 when I do not not enjoy grinding for power, yet power has pretty much been the only reward in the last four years that I went after.
---
Because it's a nonsense argument and I'm calling it out, because that's what I do. The "grind" is not anywhere close to four years for full ascended, and that's even assuming you need full ascended. I can't even imagine what a low gold/hour you must be averaging to not simply be able to buy your gear at full price having played so long.
---
I don't play WvW, if I do it's only for the gift of battle. I don't really complain about how long the gift takes to get, even though it's a bit annoying. 
---
However, you know what I do to get my gift? I run with the zerg to get max participation and then I do nothing. Except from capturing a camp every ~10 minutes I'm AFK and watch videos. So you could say I just wait to get my gift. 
---
I don't think that I'm the only one (at least from what I heared from other players I'm not) and I think this can't be very good for WvW. A new, additional source could help to solve this problem.
---
I dont what if they costed 1k gold on each use. Anet fucked up by not having this basic system yeaes ago. I and just about everyone else who actually play content outside of open world have been using arc as our build templates for years bc Anet refused to make one. If they fuck it up more then it doesnt really bother me at this point
---
thank you so much for the advice, ya i've been salvaging every single item i dont use and stuffed in my bank haha
---
But they did complain about having to do PvE? that's why they have ascended armor through vendors that's upgradeable to legendary....
---
the wings are aesthetic only, who do i see about a grind refund?
---
Britney impact, #FreeBritney (from her conservatorship)
---
The first of three collections for Coalescence. It requires you to clear Wing 5 then go to various locations and "meditate" (/sit).
---
I'm very aware of how aggressive they use addiction psychology and data analysis on a near-dystopian level.
---
I'm specifically postulating on MMOs specifically and how the average profile of a whale is probably radically different from other genres of games (Again, I've played those games, and I know what the conventional whale looks like).

---
else
---
   Droprate = 5%
---
You're in the else case.
---
They can and probably do this shit. Not very hard to track item source
---
Actually yes, you are right. They should add an equivalent to Gift of Exploration to a WvW and PvP track. Since there really isn't that much effort to full map complete anymore. Especially if you have mounts. And hell, if PvE players start flocking to WvW or PvP because the track is faster than doing a World Complete, then that's good for that game mode, now, isn't it? And if you're worried about people getting Legendary items too easily.  
---
And why \*not\* a Dragon Stand reward track that gives Crystalline Ore and maybe even an Amalgamated Gemstone (or two!) in the reward structure? Not like it would ruin the economy of Crystalline Ore, since it's account bound. And again, if it brings players to WvW/ PvP because it's faster to farm that than farm Dragon's Stand, then so much the better, right?  
---
What I want to know, is why do WvW players have to defend their mode when the idea of offering a different means of acquiring the Gift of Battle comes up?
---
So what reward exists in PvP that is unique to that mode, that would require me to go into PvP to get?
---

Thank you mate for your tips, I tried necro to 36 and now trying paladin, I think I’m more into paladin but will try both of them more. Have a mice day :)
---
The twin problems with this are that it's solving the wrong problem and that there is a far simpler solution to the problem they think they should solve.
---
* Solving the wrong problem: The core problem of WvW isn't that matches aren't balanced, it's that they aren't fun. Make the gameplay fun (yes, even fun for the side/sides that are losing) and you'll attract players.
---
* The balance issue they described at the outset was that they have/had a couple of servers that were too large for any amount of linking and rebalancing to create good matchups.
---
   * The solution for this is to bust up the Too Big To Exist WvW servers. Split That Which Shall Not Be Named into 3 servers (randomly assigned) and give everyone one free transfer.

This is so reliant on Metas and the help of other people though.

Were you really so lucky that you loaded into AB right after meta?! for [Overseer's Cave](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overseer%27s_Cave) or is there some way to get it other than the event-chain?
---
And that is exactly why you get the choice of going full legendary or 3 sets of gear in your inventory. 
---
Saying it doesn't encourage people to continually engage with the game is just a falacy, not every single person that plays GW2 does it to get the next tier of gear as you have to do in other games or MMOs. Which you are pretty much suggesting. Even if they were to add a new tier of gear to go on top of ascended, the progression gap you talk about would still exist because legendary gear would be updated to have the same traits as the new tier + legendary traits just like when ascended gear was first released.
---
The problem is that 99% of the ingame rewards are no different than getting gemstore items.
---
Even if you go out and do content that's largelr repetitive and easy aside from the few raid rewards. You are sitll stopped at the end by "Now go pay hundreds of gold worth of materials". Almost everything earnable IN GAME requires a huge gold sink so why would most people not just Gold -&gt; Gems and buy the often better looking gem store rewards. It's barely any different because the bigugest barrier is go grind gold.
---
Right, so... stuff I can get the equivalent of in other modes. Except the llamas. There are no equivalences in other modes for the llamas.  
---
I mean, yeah... The skins are unique, but I can get other skins too.
---
That's exactly how the official forums work and it's pathetic.
---
"We have a permanent gem store team and sometimes they complete items the live teams have planned bit couldn't get to" is not the same thing at all as "we do not make or care about rewards unless we can put them in the gem store".
---
Come on now.
---
It's not for everyone but a full fractal run (T4 + recs) earns you more than enough relics to buy the daily limit of 2 clovers.
---
I kinda' thought the same thing. Even as a non-repeatable track.
---
*Zzzzz*
---
We already have that in the form of ascended gear statswapping. I think instead of making a whole new system its best to improve on the one we already have with features such as keeping the looks of our gear along with the runes/sigils when we statswap along with adding acquisition of the insignias/inscriptions you require to statswap to different vendors across the game just like the magic vendor from episode 3 of LS4 (your plaguedoctor example) sells you exotic insignias/inscriptions for volatile magic + map currency. 
---
This way you keep people new and existing to comitting to farming the maps to try the new rune/set. Wether they like it or not, they'll have to commit themselves to farming a different map to go back to where they were or try something new. All while keeping the principal purpose of legendary gear which is the convenience of swapping without having to do all that.
---
I keep on saying it should not happen. Because it is not changing anything. They said they wont adress the night caps. And alliances is good but nothing is still changing because all the players that are not in a WvW guild or in a alliance will be placed out were there are free space and there is no way for you to kick them off if they don't want to follow what the alliance decided how their world should work. 
---
So exactly as it is now. People carry and leachers leaching. People still gonna sit in SM and repair walls and there wont be a damn thing we can do about it. And movements is still gonna be a thing.
---
We bled out way to many veterans so we don't have enough players wanting to lead and structure a alliance and yeah sure they might come back for a few weeks but then nothing have changed so they will leave again. 
---
So merge servers, do tournaments, remove the fact that you can get participation by reparing walls in SM being trebbed eating up all the supplies, make structures mean something, better reward, better ballance and less movments. Nothing of this should take years because most of the tec is already there. The torumements probably need to be cleaned up due to coding now and back then. But hey it should for sure go faster.
---
I made Chuka and Champawat and still think about the collections. At first I thought it was a drag but then I started loving it. I had a legendary weapon but now it has depth rather than just crafting [a rainbow dildo](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Bifrost) without any other depth than G R I N D
---
[Darkness Dye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Darkness_Dye) recently entered the realm of affordable dyes.
---
It's possibly one of the most "high resolution" black dyes you'll ever find, and while on some armor it isn't black but more gray-ish, it's probably still a better pick than shadow abyss.
---
Congrats! This game offers so many rewarding experiences!
---
Don't say playing the game when you mean grinding.
---
There is nothing enjoyable about map completion. Over. And over. And over. This is a grind it's not playing the game and doing what you want, you're funneled into a specific type of content. Map completion and quests for keys which COST TIME
---
You want to open up your hero panel and click on the story journal tab, then click 'Path of Fire' and choose to begin that story - the big green star on your map will tell you where to go, there's a boring conversation and then the fun stuff starts. Of course you'll be missing a huge chunk of storyline since there are many Living World episodes and the Heart of Thorns expansion between the base game and Path of Fire, but you can still start the PoF expansion content right away and you'll get your first mount during the first mission if you don't mind potential spoilers.
---
As you explore the Path of Fire areas, you'll find very generous hero point challenges on the map that give you 10 points a piece instead of the 1 point you get from core maps. Good luck unlocking the spec! Remember Path of Fire's quite a bit tougher than the core content so you might want to buy yourself an exotic set of gear from the tradepost. High DPS gear is Berserker's or Viper's stats, but it leaves you very squishy.
---
Also, I wouldn't worry too much about crafting ascendeds in your first week, you need crafting level 500 and quite a few resources to make weapons/armour. It's better to focus on getting ascended trinkets first, since those aren't crafted, but instead received via story mission rewards, bought with laurels (from daily rewards), guild commendations (guild mission rewards), fractal relics (fractal mini dungeon rewards) or a select few achievements/collections.
---
Rox finally found a home.
---
Maybe she will return with the Olmakhans in the future, for a big boss battle/pre meta like Dragon Stand.
---
Pretty sure that axe 5 on soulbeast or dh trap hit harder than MS because of diminishing returns.
---
As for condi I think that flamewall (focus 4) on weaver, buffed with glyph and arcane power has very high potential. 
---
I don't have access to the game atm, but it should be fairly easy to test.
---
Well, it's the only possible conclusion since you are accusing OP of plagiarism just because his code is private, without providing any further arguments to substantiate your point.
---
And if you are going to come with the "same commands", "same functionalities" or "similar layout response" like the rest of the crowd, save us both some time and don't.
---
The point where maybe she still salty and hate Elder Dragons gonna try and kill Aurene and we try to kill her.
---
First off, we don’t know anything about season 5 and how much content it actually holds. Until they announce what the update is, it is just a puff of smoke. They have fallen really short of any meaningful content in an update before and I’ve learned to not have any expectations whatsoever. Until actual information is given to us, I’m imagining them with thumbs up their asses while they hit on/off switches for past events.
---
Is that a Freddy Mercury cosplay? xD
---
I stopped paying pvp when they dumbed down and made rewards obtainable even when you lose. This opened up the gates for players who doesn’t care about pvp and just go there for the rewards without wanting to even win a game. I think bots also became a thing due to this.
---
WVW I still play occasionally. I do agree with what others had mentioned in that the mounts killed roaming. Server linking was introduced to fix population but it also removed server unity/pride imo.  Still waiting on alliances.
---
Most fun i had in wvw was during the early years when we had the tournaments. I burned out a bit after the first one but was eager to play again on the 2nd tournament.
---
Did you even read the whole comment? Map completion wasn't even the topic here, I just mentioned as an additional source. And I mentioned only 3 maps that take 5-10 minutes to complete. 
---
If you want to complain, learn to read the whole comment and understand the point of it. It's not that hard...
---
Fun fact: back then, condi builds were relatively rare and ran into diminishing returns if you had more than one. Stackable conditions were capped at 25 stacks, so any more were effectively wasted, which made condition builds useless in world boss fights and weak in group content. It also didn't help that expertise wasn't a thing. Iirc, they removed the stack cap around HoT's release (either within the months leading up to it or at launch), and added Viper's and other sets with expertise and condition damage with HoT. As a guy who played sword warrior at the time (and still), I was ecstatic.
---
If you put the legendary skin on a regular weapon you'll get all the shiny stuff from it, footsteps, sounds, auras etc. but not stat swapping/sigil swapping if that's what you mean.
---
Same as above, you lose all the shiny effects but you keep your ability to freely change the stat and sigils on the weapon.
---
Stat swapping is really inconvenient for trying out new gear sets. Having to pay and forge to swap back and forth is tedious and wouldn't work with build templates.
---
My suggestion is that if there was less of a barrier to swap, more people would put the effort in to unlock the swap.
---
Talking cabbage?
---
1) Yes
---
2) Yes
---
Child please.
---
I agree with your point about getting them for free (though at cost of time). 
---
But it's not through playing, it's through grinding. Please reread your own comment. Take a deep breath first.
---
Something something... technology isn't there...
---
Yes to both
---
You'll retain the stat and rarity attributes of each weapon, but the effects come with the skin, not with the weapon
---
So a legendary weapon transmuted to look like any other weapon will still be able to stat swap and sigil swap, but it won't have the cosmetic effects
---
If you have the Ley-line Converter you can grab one each day, the rest you can get just by doing day-time events in VB.

I know. I just think that luck is sometimes more impressive than planning.

completely understandable that his weakness is the creepiest man in game
---
Those are examples of people/characters behaving badly either for sociopathic levels of "IDGAF" or on purpose for attention.  Canach's snide and sometimes dark humor comes from having been dealt a number of very bad hands in life and needing some way to cope.  
---
A spot of comedy to ease the pain and deal with the fear being far more healthy than a post-traumatic tail-spin.  It's something only people who develop that mechanism really seem to appreciate.
---
I'm not sure what the difference between daily and active players are, unless you mean people who log on, do dailies, and log off vs those who do other things as well, in which case I couldn't tell you and I doubt many people could.
---
But the population still looks pretty good to me, at least in PvE (I don't know about PvP and WvW since I haven't played much of them recently). It's no peak WoW, but it's still plenty of people.
---
Mounts are moving too fast in WvW, it's some kind of powercreep. It gives the dominating side more options to control the map, while the weaker sides still have to spend time for gates. Add that moving in enemy territory is slower than in your own: mounts in WvW favour the winning side. And this is just one bad aspect of mounts.
---
Other factos like jumping over gates, downed killing, WvW newbies or players without PoF lagging behind, difficulties for small scale groups/roamers, WvW maps initially not designed for mounts (rezz rushing into a keep and hold it till your zerg arrives) etc. are all also problematic.
---
That's easy! [Point blank shot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Point_Blank_Shot), because anytime a ranger uses that skill, it hits me real hard. Like "my dog just died" hard.
---
I think it will be probably a mobile game
---
Let's expose some people.
---
i did not rly think about glyph of elemental power or things like that. But it does not feel right because its just strait up a second skill thats meant to buff an other skill. It will not be permitted and I already added a rule for that. Thanks for somehow pointing it out.
---
&gt; Canach's snide and sometimes dark humor comes from having been dealt a number of very bad hands in life and needing some way to cope.
---
I know. Thats basically how I am now a days. But because of that, this being real life, I have a tendancy to turn people off and away. Most people initially dont find me agreeable. Or likeable.
---
And I appreciate it. Trust me. Canach is one of my favorite characters and its a shame he didnt get any screen time on Episode 6 but I understand why. His trope had no place during those very serious moments. Would be hard to write a character like that into that type of story moment.
---
Then you just have answered what you really want. Its called Legendary gear, its meant to give you convenience and you can get it ingame. 
---
You're not suggesting to ease the barrier to swap, you just want to get the legendary functionality on every single piece of gear to not have to commit on crafting/getting another set of ascended gear or exotic gear.
---
Build templates will work just as well as the templates provided by ArcDPS if you commit yourself to having multiple sets of ascended gear. Which in itself works as a goal you can work and build towards to get a sense of progression that's not meaningless once you decide to work and build towards legendary gear as you will have that free set of gear since you're gonna have to recycle one of those sets for legendary armor and then you can leave the remaining one or two sets you might have to different characters progressing them in the path of having ascended gears or an additional set.
---
The only realistic scenario where you would need the convenience of stat swapping on the fly to try out a new gear set is when you're doing a test/benchmark because otherwise I can't picture a single scenario where you have to swap a stat that having different sets of gear can't fix.
---
It’s not speculation. It’s what they said.

---
Do research before you come at people with your feelings.
---
&gt; Different than every other game
---
False. Every other MODERN game - maybe, but not "every game, period". Historically team-based games always had two teams of different colors, and you were assigned to one of those colors, and you had to remember which one is your team and which one is your enemy. You're on red team - cool, I kill blue peeps now. It's not that difficult of a concept to graps. It's just a team, color means nothing, it might as well be green, yellow or purple. But alas, as it always goes with literally everything, modern games decided to simplify things even further, catering to an audience of complete idiots, and now there are no "two equal teams", now there are only "good guys" - blue team which includes you, and "bad guys" - red, because of course red is a bad color. I'm glad GW2 didn't jump on this trend.
---
Yes. Mounts improve map control which helps the winning side. If you are outnumbered - like 100 vs 10 - you have to sneakily get your own towers back. Enemy zerg is now much faster moving, which makes it difficult to get your own towers/keeps back before they arrive.
---
The pure and beautiful role playing game!

This should really fill you with a sense of pride and accomplishment

How does lv3 kill shot measure up against a 7 malice death's judgement?
---
Reassuring and exciting
---
That's nice :)
---
No, raids/whatever endgame hard content must have unique rewards, unless the easy way of getting them would take literally years. It has to be unattractive enough to grind for that people will flock to endgame content to get the stuff. They already do this, though. Unique rewards aren't a problem in raids/pvp, there are tons of unique skins and titles and items like the White Mantle Portal Device etc. The problem is when the optimal way to acquire rewards is to not actually play the game, just swipe credit card or press f a bunch of times or auto attack with a zerg. The problems with raids and wvw and pvp are separate, they have to do with release cadence and (for raids at least) difficulty, as raids are too difficult for new players to get into and too easy for veterans.
---
How is Aion being so stable? This game is 11 years old.
---
I've complained about this before with WvW. I don't know why they decided to use the 3 colors of nameplates (party = blue, ally = green, enemy = red) for the teams.
---
All I can really say is that the event chain works and I've done it many times to help others. She does spawn and walk around the outpost before staying in the side area waiting for the defense event to start. After the event succeeds she will start her escort (I think I'd estimate it takes 10-15m), then the normal fight when she gets there. If you're trying to get it still check that it's not already running (area to the west), if it's not active wait for the defense event, if that is done then just wait for the escort to start.
---
Do you have a more direct source? 
---
&gt; Back in 2018, Mike Z sat down with us at Gamescom and revealed that Guild Wars 2 would not get a third expansion, at least not any time soon.
---
That's a second hand statement, not a direct quote and certainly not ANet's official position. Nothing in that article is a direct statement from Mike or ANet.
---
And even if it was an official ANet statement an xpac coming out in 2021 (1.5 years from now, after season 5) fits with "not any time soon" from the perspective of 2018.
---
Uh, that felt genuine. 
---
Hope he doesn't get fired or anything.
---
But tbh, this makes me more hyped than whole august 30th announcement thing.
---
&gt; Child please.
---
Do you really feel forced to bully people to make yourself feel better? You must see some kind of "danger" in me then. Calm down dude, this is not your schoolyard, you don't have to show that "your are the greatest boi around". 
---
&gt; But it's not through playing, it's through grinding.
---
And were exactly is the grind? Grinding means repeating the same stuff over and over again, but that's not the case here. All methods to get keys I listed are unique *and* I recommended to do them in a weekly cycle. 
---
Do you really try to say that repeating something in a weekly cycle is grinding? Or do you still talk about map completion? Again, that *never* was the topic here.
---
&gt; Please reread your own comment.
---
Still nothing about map completion grinding. Please reas it again, too. 
---
From your previous comment:
---
&gt; his is a grind it's not playing the game and doing what you want
---
Why do you think so? Why shouldn't I want to play this certain content? People aren't forced to do this, even if they want BLC keys, there are many other ways. 
---
If somebody don't want to play certain content, then he won't do it.  Easy at it is. Don't pretend that anybody is forced to do something only because it's possible. 
---
If I show you a way to get 60g/h, would you say people are forced to do this, too? Only because it's possible? *It's grinding, because you are forced to play certain content* This argument is not only nonesense, it's also the wrong definition of grinding.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWvfMLl4ho) is what it was a reference to, and the dev who said that asked for it not to be taken out of that context, which, of course, was left out of this clip.
---
They actually explain that when you hit level 40... for like 3 seconds then are never mentioned again. Really should have like an quick in-game index of tips you learn from the level up menus and stuff like that.
