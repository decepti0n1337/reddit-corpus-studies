&gt;And you do realize that companies are meant to make more money, right?
---

---
This argument is infuriatingly dumb. For one, it's stupidly obvious. Thanks, we know that companies exist to make money. Second, it's not really an excuse for anything. Companies are meant to make money, but you can definitely have concerns about how they make that money; to just shrug and say "well they're meant to make money" as if that justifies every mean is just beyond stupid.

I'm aware that Trident is being used in various Windows software and even system components to render stuff but such situation shouldn't happen - especially when application doesn't require network connection at all. Maybe it's some telemetry within dotnet?
---
All the upper part of the industry does this. Costs have been going up with inflation and larger competition and more difficult vast "realistic" environments as goals, but consumers are not psychologically ready to pay more than a certain ingrained number for games, so they have to resort to such "tricks".
---
For one, just remember the original uproar at HoT announcement, after which moderately priced gliders came out, and how they had to decrease the price for PoF to then wind up prices for premium mounts and lootboxed mounts.
---
Cause evade spam.
---
It always depends on what your keybinds are. Not everyone have the keys you have mentioned "free". Personally I those keys I've put the keybinds for the new templates.
---
for me it's more like they're just stubborn. It's been like that since they introduced ascended gear.
---
Thx for the tip, there is no reason to be outraged thow.
---
Legit false advertising?
---
It suggests that they won't have to put any effort into developing another expansion for their game. They can just skate by on the paltry, lackluster piecemeal story releases from now on.
---
why would i care about my gear/build in the jp?
---
It would be nice if you got 1 build template plus 1 for pvp and wvw(already existed), then 1 for each expansion you own. 5 build templates default would have really mitigated this problem. I wouldn't doubt the additional templates are for possible inclusion in the future with non-individually-purchasable content.
---
That's what. $680 USD for 9 people? Fuck that noise.
---
&gt; And there's nothing left in the game to come back to.
---
And there's no one left in the game to come back to either.
---
Being disheartened casual vet is awkward position to be in. I want to be excited for future community interactions but can't force myself into that mindset long enough to reach out. I suppose it's maintenance mode until my will to stay in touch with GW2 turns to dust.
---
I sincerely hope you'll find a game, or something different altogether, that will ignite you like gw2 used to.
---
The mount controversy has always felt stupid to me. Put it this way. Imagine if they added a vendor ti Amnoon that sold you a Mysterious Egg for \~177 gold? You take that egg and you hatch it and it's a mount skin! Can you imagine the reddit posts? People would be going insane "ANet finally listened to us, we can earn mount skins in-game!"
---
ANet's management are almost certainly the ones who designed this system, leaving the devs to figure out how to implement it but probably largely out of the process of designing its core functionality and monetization.
---
What people seem to be taking the most issue with isn't the implementation - the core design philosophy of the entire system and its predatory monetization is the primary focus of current player ire. ANet reeks of shitty management, not shitty programmers.
---
Some unmaintainable code is inevitable given a large enough project, but if your project is accumulating unmaintainable code with every release, I think it's much more likely to be a result of management failing to understand the necessity of dedicating resources to upgrading and refactoring the project's core code (especially the oldest code) than it is to be a result of every programmer at ANet being inexplicably unable to maintain their code.
---
This, along with the insane time it took to develop (more than 1 year and a half), make me question some things. I know they have spaghetti code, and I know because of my job how some things that look simple may be huge depending on the actual existing code. But to make something like those templates require 1.5+ YEARS of work (even assuming it's a single dev) ? That's a stretch. Then you add a few ways it breaks, especially the one in this post. I wonder if the dev in charge made something like actually changing all the things in the game that read equipment/build stuff to work, one by one, maybe forgetting some (mad king tower / maybe activities systems in general) ... instead of adding an abstraction layer between the templates and the rest of the game to make it transparent for all existing systems. As bold of an hypothesis as it is, it'd explain both the long dev time and some of the bugs.
---
And then there is the limitation to 24 storage slots that make build storage nearly moot. Either it was entirely driven by monetization, they were afraid that many people would not fill more than a few storage slots and they couldn't have a too big difference between free slots, unlock pack size and total max slots. Or, it's simply because the dev in charge made a database table with as many columns as templates (it's been confirmed that they use relational dbms, maybe oracle), maybe multiplied by number of info per build, making it a fixed amount of builds per account and maybe hitting a limit (though it's 1000 on oracle, just checked google and found a guy who wanted to store 5 minutes interval data in daily rows with many columns, I cried). I really, really hope that this stupid hypothesis is just a stupid hypothesis. But tbh my faith in the average anet dev (not the few prominent guys) has decreased over the years.
---
A guy on our team got the map selection bug where it won't go away. He relogged. Then he got this bug. It was a sad display of game design.
---
Original skill trees were archaic at launch, felt a bit like a placeholder from prototype phase (it worked but was mostly irritating). They had an option for a complete rework with new trait system but they opted for quick fix and now we have this mess. 
---
In all honesty they should have waited with equipment templates for a month or two and test problems just on the skill tabs, but December is close so gotta rake that Christmas money. Also in-game notepad as a paid feature is a disgrace.
---
It was supposed to make money. Which it will.
---
Oh what an adjective\_compassionate corporate entity, how will their worker\_id#1-200 ever get necessity\_food on the table if income\_net\_quarterly &lt;  expectation\_ncsoft. It truly makes me emotion\_sorrow.
---
Yeah people have been crashing maps (by accident or on purpose) all day. I can't get any metas done...
---
Because they aren't misrepresenting the actual functionality of the product, it probably isn't legally false advertising. It's close, but I don't think it would count.
---
Underrated comment of the templates!
---
You know... If they had named it honestly, I think there would have been 40% less rage.
---
Of course... then there wouldn't be an "equipment template" system and they wouldn't have been able to say that their deal with arcdps was fulfilled....
---
[removed]
---
The trust issue is nothing but my own fault? My trust issue is completely justified. I don't see how you can even think that you know what influenced my trust issue and telling me that it's my own fault other than you trying hard to get your shiny white armor points. Anything else is completely beyond me.
---
Been here since pre-purchase days, clocked 13k hours into the game, acquired 38k AP so I've been here a loooong time and through it all. So it's a fact that the last year or so has been the worst year for GW2 in its entire lifespan. Anet has done so many things in the last year to disappoint their playerbase, the game is bleeding players constantly, especially veterans, and doing nothing to keep them or make them return. Many people I personally know left the game and have no plans to come back again. And things like the current mess with templates will just solidify their decision. So no, I didn't lie to myself nor are my trust issues my own fault.
---
The is currently in the worst state its ever been in and many people share that opinion. And there are many valid reasons why people thing that. Sadly they can't pull the plug on GW2 because it's the only money maker Anet has so they'll just continue to drip 'content' slowly here and there that is basically just grind fests and try their hardest to squeeze all the money they can.
---
So yeah, Anet has lost my trust a while back, it was their fault alone for that, so no I won't trust any PR statements that come out of them. Especially about arcs templates.
---
Technically it really isn't incest. They're not children of anyone and aren't genetically related. They're all born from the same source, sure, so you could say that it can be incest but they're really not true family through genetics. Just familial ties from a common source.
---
The only Sylvari that are actually brothers and sisters are twins born from the same pod. And even that is extremely rare in their society. There has been only one confirmed case of twins in-game as of right now.
---
Sylvari are also unable to reproduce sexually so there is no danger to incest.
---
As to why there are a lot of same sex relationships in the Sylvari is simple, they don't care about genders. You can think of all Sylvari as being pansexual, they are attracted to whomever they fall in love with. Though there could be Sylvari with preferences, yes. Generally speaking, they love the soul more than the body. It's why to them love can be far more tragic than to any other race, they're much more spiritual and less carnal. And also, far more naive than the other races.
---
And roll backs on top of it.  Just did the gauntlet and now I have to do it over again.
---
I think most of the backlash that people focus on regarding gem store pricing is that it's character bound. If it was account bound, the vocal group would likely be a little less upset regarding the gem store portion of it.
---
I agree with you, I wouldn't say it's predatory since it lines up with the pricing of other character bound upgrades. Do I like it? Not at all, but I also didn't like how the character based QoL (inventory slots, etc.) was implemented either. A lot of the criticism is valid, but I would say the gem store was pretty in-line with expectations.
---
Some people are happy with 0-95% and would rather get that experience again. Some people's fun only starts when progressing from 95 to 99%, when it is about tiny details.
---
They're functional. They just don't work for reproduction but they work in other ways.
---
Sylvari drink, you know. And to have sex, your junk has to function. If not you'd just be dry humping leaves.
---
The real spook here isn’t the 666, it’s that you did it this many times at all.
---
yeah, I've been doing a bit of retro gaming the past month or so, it is very refreshing.
---
Okay, but it’s kind of insane to give ArenaNet a pass because “the code is old and the people aren’t here anymore”. Literally any long-running online game deals with this issue.
---
Riot has dealt with it multiple times, the most egregious being their notoriously bad Death Recap. Tackling and fixing that took years &amp; completely broke the game for a while... but they still did it and now it’s fine.
---
Blizzard infamously couldn’t increase the size of the default bag without breaking the entire game. Eventually they did and whoa, it broke the game... but now it’s fine.
---
Giving ANet a pass because it would be hard is absurd to me because *it’s only going to get harder the longer you put it off*. Rewriting clunky, poorly optimized or even downright broken code is hard, painful, time consuming... and an integral part of running a long term online world.
---
And if ANet isn’t willing to operate to the standards of their competitors, they deserve the ire of the people they’ve tried to fleece before they abandon ship.
---
When you say change traits, you mean swap from one build template tab to another? In that case it sounds like what's happening here is that its unequipping and re-equipping all of your skills, which would force it to go on cooldown yea (same as if you replaced a slot with a mantra with a signet and then changed it back to a mantra).
---
Here's a list of critical mistakes in design, all in my opinion, of course:
---
* Aquabreathers should have been removed altogether, and turned into a visual element similar to gliders. This would also enable "swimming equipment skin" as a gem store product (fins+breather+scuba tank skin set, for example). Instead, they doubled down by adding ascended aquabreathers.
---
* Agony should have been turned into an accountbound system, similar to PvP and WvW ranks, with experience obtained by playing the content or consuming agony essences just like with luck. Instead they doubled down by adding upgradeable +1, +2, +3... agony infusions.
---
* Infusions should have been removed altogether, aesthetic ones integrated into a new wardrobe system. Instead they doubled down, and implemented new infusions with key attributes like power and condition damage.
---
* Potential equipment wardrobe, which would make equipment pieces easy to template-ify, since they wouldn't be different from skills or traits anymore. Destroy an equipment piece, and it becomes usable for the whole account. Instead they made legendary equipment have selectable stats.
---
* Enable mix and match between outfits and armor pieces. Outfits would cover multiple skin slots at once (a dress would cover all slots except the head and the feet).
---
* Hairstyle customization shouldn't be locked to the gem store. Make hairstyles helm skins instead, and sell them individually just like any other armor skin. This would also allow easy hair-dyeing.
---
* Divide the helm skin slot into three different slots: Head, eyes, and mouth. Head would include hats, eyes sunglasses, and mouth masks. Some skins would cover multiple slots at once (full-face masks would cover eyes and mouth, and helms would cover the three of them).
---
* Transmutation should have been removed, and replaced with a "custom outfit" system, or aesthetic templates if you prefer. This would let players save their skin setups for free, and equip them easily, just like you equip an outfit. They would also be able to link their creations in chat to share them with other players. Each character could have 2-3 outfit slots, with more available in exchange of gems.
---
* Oversaturation of multiple gem store product lines with too many products in a short span of time, many of them having a questionable quality, leading to an overall devaluation. This includes: Miniatures, finishers, endless gathering tools, costume brawl toys, mail carriers, gliders, outfits, and mounts, among many others.
---
* Complete carelessness regarding huge would-be gem store sellers like swimsuits, effect dyes (metallic material where applied) polymock (using miniatures, or a new TCG-like system), combat tonics based on legendary characters (including custom voices and animations, imagine playing as Shiro or Joko), or player housing.
---
I could go on and on, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
---
As a computer engineer graduate, I can understand the technical limitations and would've never released this as it is. I would've tested it much more and, if not feasible, cancelled the project.
---
As a consumer, I see this as a blatant cashgrab that actually blocks a viable solution made by users through a previously approved addon. Also, they are egregiously monetizing a messy product that produces only more bugs and renders the whole game experience less stable and enjoyable.
---
Circle around the problem however you want: they wanted just more money totally uncaring of the actual gameplay experience, even if it gets worse.
---
This is an insult to veteran customers.
---
got disconnected and now cant get back into game on any character. gets stuck on load screen
---
He's not changing a skill though. Just a trait. The charged mantra isn't being changed. Just the traits. 
---
Doing it by hand is fine. Doing it by template does a CD.

It's 2019.. This is the year game companies do one fuck up after another.
---
Actually Blizzards stock is trending upward and isnt doing bad.
---
what? Are you confusing the build templates with the build storage templates? ALL your 10 characters have gotten 3 free build slots and 2 free equipment slots, you absolutely don't need to pay anything to keep the functionality of having different builds for PvE, PvP and WvW on each character
---
Yeah that's my main issue, idgaf about more space in my inv, i maxed that shit out....i want to swap between builds easily while still being able to equip one of the weapons i have on some other build, for either pre-boon stack or pre-casts.
---
Greed and our economy are synonymous, and they always have been. You can argue for other economic systems if you'd like, but that's a far greater cultural shift than game pricing.
---
It doesn't really matter how we individually make value judgments, because as a culture at large we have been conditioned to free online services when it comes to the internet, and the way people think has been conditioned accordingly. Maybe it would be better if we didn't think that way, but that's a huge cultural shift, and cultural shifts happen neither overnight nor without reason.
---
We've been heading this way with gaming for quite a while now, and all signs indicate that it's not stopping. Perhaps it *should*, but again, what should be and what is are rarely in alignment. I don't know that that's reason enough to give up or not care, but that's the hard reality of where we are now.
---
If your technical debt is this massive, you're either incompetent, lazy, or milking the product for all it's worth. There is a point where you've got to start modernizing/fixing your engine before it falls apart, and ANet's reached that point a while ago. The question, then, is: which of the three statements is the reality here?
---
It's more about stubbornness than anything, when a company's most recognized community manager has this kind of attitude, you can pretty much get the gist on what kind of stance they have about feedback.

[https://i.ibb.co/4TkZpfZ/gaile.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/4TkZpfZ/gaile.jpg)
---
Getting the same set of errors here since the patches earlier this week
---
It feels like the old days when we had occasional ddos attacks, but Blizzard isn't behind it. It wouldn't surprise me, however, if some irate group of people wasn't behind it. The community is pretty angry at this time.
---
&gt; Blizzard is hemmoraging stock prices
---
[hmmmm](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/atvi), are we talking about the same stocks?
---
Yea, I hadn't even started using them until June or so and it changed my life as someone who plays Heal Ren/Alac Ren/Power Herald/Hand Kite on one character.
---
TL;DR even if they had been better implemented I still find extra toons more useful. Extra toons make it easier to get my hair matching my gear and doesn 't leave me with the wrong food up.
---
TBH it seems like an over reaction to me. Sure they could have been better implemented. Of course they are monetizing. They have a business to run.
---
Personally the standard gear and build loudouts are fine with me. Maybe on one toon I'll use more than the standard amount but I won't use them that much all in all.
---
Now it's true I have more character slots than I know what to do with (16 with 3 unused) but I'm fine with a toon per game mode per profession I care about.
---
I have a few pvp toons. Many wvw toons. A few pve toons. The free templates will let me switch between pve and wvw. My spvp toons are spvp only and usually ungeared. Maybe I'll play around with a second build on some of these.
---
In wvw my dps toons can now have a roamer variant and  a zerg variant.
---
But my support wvw toons don't roam or pve. Why?  Because they have ascended food up with primers. Similarly can't take a wvw toon to spvp without losing my food.
---
Additionally managing many builds over many characters has always been a challenge with regular patches in any game. I don't want tons of builds many of which will be stale after a few months.
---
So a second build to use on a few of my characters is fine with me. Maybe on my ele, which is close to my main I'll use more than the standard.
---
I realize not everyone has lots of char slots but I'd recommend buying those rather than template slots.
---
Finally the real reason I won't use the templates? All my gear load outs would need similar color schemes or my hair wont match😋
---
As for legendary armor I never thought those were worth the cost so I don't care how they work in templates. Far simpler to just make a new ascended set or restat an existing one. I've got 12 or so and can make others if and when I need. It's certainly enough to have full ascended on all the toons I ever play in pve or wvw. I have one piece of legendary armor to see what it took and am in no hurry to make more (don't find the skins all that attractive either so that's no incentive for me)
---
then fork out the money. you can change your build without this, time consuming, but thats why theyve added these things, dont cry its too expensive, you dont actually NEED it!
---
The interface is already mostly done. Click the button, store builds on disk. Click the button again, store builds in storage.
---
That way we can still have build saving for those who do not play always in the same computer, and those who need way more storage slots can use the client-side solution.
---
I think this is one of those situations where if you don't like what you get in a PUG, then you make a static group of friends to do it daily. If you want to go in with randoms, then expect the skill level of your team won't always be up to your standards.
---
Technical limitations, huh?
---
Where does one find this “player count on the menu screen” and when did anet “confirm it was global players.”  I’ve never heard of either in the past 6 years and I’ve stayed pretty well informed of most things
---
you can manualy change these things, if buying these make you better then they should be overpriced. GG
---
I dont play anymore xD so GG
---
Yes you are correct, I found the issue - it's a carry-over from the prototype. The control defaults to "http://www.google.com" but it immediately replaced with the local web page. Nothing nefarious, but it will be removed for next release.

People can crash the instance on purpose by ultilizing the new feature of build templates. It gives the players a new sense of accomplishment when they finally get to complete the meta crash free.
---
God I wish that were me
---
The trading post is basically unusable for me. I go to put in my 50+ buy/sell orders and either takes 30 seconds per item or it just flat out hangs.
---
But my point is are you really a dps if you do less dps than a support?
---
&gt;The story is written from a genderless, raceless blob commander.
---
1.  This isn't actually true.  Best example would be the "A Meeting of Ministers" from *The Head of the Snake* where Queen Jennah tells us how she considers us a trusted friend.  This makes sense for a human commander who interacted with her repeatedly during the Personal Story.  For the other races, she's telling us this literally the first time we've ever met her.  While this particular example is particularly in your face, there's lots of other instances of the commander saying something that only really makes sense if they're a human.
---
2. Even to the extent it is true, it's kind of the entire problem.  The commander isn't a genderless, raceless blob, so treating them like one leads to bad writing.  Again, Rox is a big example: her "I want to find a warband" character arc reads entirely different with a Charr commander who has a warband she could join than with a non-Charr commander who doesn't.  This makes her leaving for the Olmakhan contains an implicit rejection for charr players that doesn't exist otherwise, and it's there whether the writers intended it to be there or not.
---
Who exactly is throwing a tantrum?
---
Thanks!
---
In its 7 years was there a point where people thought GW2 was managed well?  I feel like living world season 1, HoT launch, PoF post content release, and a lot of other times it was shown that management had issues.
---
And if said company/corporation doesn't make enough money to meet the margin requirements dictated from from the shareholders then they could pull the money. The business also has keep their devs/employees happy and underpaying them won't be viable in a market as competitive as gaming. So, regardless of what the corporation's goals they still have to please their shareholders, customers, and employees.
---
Why is the  [Revenant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revenant) only server disconnected and reset?
---
Yep. This is exactly what I thought too (regarding taking this as a sign of end of life of game). I'd assume no more expansions or anything other than normal (or less) living story updates. Hope I'm wrong but seems to be too many signs to not take it that way now.
---
I really, really hate that argument, because it's *never* about whether you can afford something. It's whether you can actually justify the cost.
---
Sure, I could go ahead and buy 50 template slots right now ... but I feel like I'd get more value out of just eating out for a month, if I just wanted to burn all that money for some reason.
---
This "overwhelming negativity" from build templates would be non-existent if they didn't fuck up build templates with their overly zealous monetization and invalidation of legendary gear, and horribly implemented system that actually makes using legendary weapons an inconvenience.
---
You are being a "white knight" when you disregard all valid criticism. One is expected to learn and improve following failure; not repeat it.
---
I seriously doubt they'd do that. People tend to see more intent behind the marketing on things like this than is really there. Particularly when they view the company in question as being more desperate than they actually are.
---
They might add more slots, but if they do it will be because people are giving them feedback that 6 isn't enough. It's also entirely possible that they just won't add more slots and have no plans to. Putting extras into your programming code because you want things to be maintainable, or you simply don't know what limits you need to set at the time, is a very normal dev scenario.
---
ANet made a thing and put a price on it. They aren't trying to milk their players for money any more than they are by charging what they're charging for the thing in the first place.
---
Thanks to Malyck and the Seeds of Truth we know that's not the case. Other nonsentient mordrem trees like Malyck's that do not have a connection to the Dream produce humanoid sylvari too.
---
The Pale Tree says she chose that form to let them integrate better with the races of Tyria, but it seems that it's the natural form of non-corrupt sylvari, so she has to be saying that as part of the coverup to hide the fact that the Pale Tree seed came from Mordrem minions, like the seeds that resulted in Mawdrey.
---
I suspect it was their original form before Modremoth took over their people. Kind of like how species originally were before being assimilated by the Borg.  
---
Growing without the influence of Mordremoth results in more human-like form closer to the original, but once Mordremoth takes over they turn into Mordrem Guard.  
---
It's possible that the original sylvari were a race of nature elemental creatures (kind of like djinn. but planty) that was easily corrupted and consumed by Mordremoth.
---
I happily gonna pay those 360€ on top of the other ~440€ that's the equivalent of 6 years WoW Subscription. I wouldn't get that much content in 6 years wow great value for one feature.
---
&gt; They aren't trying to milk their players for money any more 
---
This whole system is exactly that, milking they playerbase.
---
Notice that I said "Build Storage", not "build templates" in reference to GW2. The build storage is a server side equivalent of GW1's system.
---
Some people arent at your skill level.
---
Fair point,  though it is somewhat unrealistic as it would require 1000s of gold to pay for the convenience, and the whole point of the systems are to nconvenience you enough to spend real money.
---
However, once again you ignore 90% of what I said and reduce it down to one point. 
---
I've given you a chance to have a fair discussion yet you continue to be ignorant towards  criticisms, reducing them singular points.
---
I'm not necessarily even saying I agree with these views or that I expect them to be free. I just understand where people are coming from who do.
---
There is a bug regarding templates that if you do something with your templates, you will crash the entire map instance you are on but you can only do it every 3-5 seconds or so. I am not posting the bug here because I do not want people to abuse it. And when people abuse this bug, the loot is rolled back for the entire server for the last minute or so.
---
After 7 years we received THE feature that has been anticipated even before the game was released. And it is half assed, limited and expensive as fuck. Yeah, stop talking about it!
---
Exactly what I was thinking. They think they're so much smarter than the playerbase. It's insulting
---
Added note: This release was supposed to make things more convenient for every one. instead you shat on raiders and made things less playable for PVPers, which is hilarious when you consider that you tried making a separate pvp development/balance group internally to improve the PVP environment. 
---
are you actually planning to IMPROVE spvp and WvW? Cuz this ain't it.
---
I don't buy the "it's a business so it's okay to rip people off" excuse. I think it is perfectly fine for games to be monetized with MTX, but within reason. Most of the items in this game are already coming out through the gem store and the gem store has a significant impact on every facet of the game just due to the way it functions with the gold conversion. They don't need to monetize these things as greedily as they are and in the long run it is better to keep people happy rather then upset them just because "it makes business sense". GW2 originally launched with the intention of not overly monetizing players and letting players decide to purchase things in the gem store if they want to support the game. Build templates go against the original pillars of that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bag space wasn't a big deal because you could make multiple characters and in the beginning the idea of converting gold -&gt; gems was much more appealing. Character slots are pretty similar in that regard. Those were the main 2 convenience features in the store aside from the original form of Transmutation charges. With the Wardrobe system combined with the various rewards of transmutation charges through the game those have become not nearly as big of a deal as they were previously and most people are okay with buying a few character slots as well as some bag space.
---
This system though, while not p2w or anything, it is certainly pay to make a system that is next to useless, useful. These are arbitrary limitations set by whoever is responsible for setting those limits, not a limit of a game system that must be made up for with money. The design of the system is great and seems fine in most respects, but the limitation by the monetization side ruins it. It is really sad to me when monetization gets in the way of what would otherwise be a pretty great system and that is exactly what we have here. Bags and character slots feel like something more of deserving of spending money since you don't really need them, but this feels like it is essentially giving you a "free trial" of the template system in order to get you to purchase more stuff.
---
There's a huge difference between charging for QoL improvements that were in their previous game for free and offered by third party software that fans made, and charging for cosmethics.
---
I don't know if you've played other games besides GW2 (sounds like you don't) because there are quite a few that have way better monetization (Warframe, Destiny 2, Path of Exile, to name a few), and usually it's those greedy korean MMOs that actually charge for stuff like, well, this one.
---
I'm okay with monetization that makes sense.  But GW2 isn't a F2P game and shouldn't be treated like one.  It's a B2P game with a gemstore and to characterize it simply as "free" fails to recognize the important B2P aspect
---
Played WvW for over an hour just now and no issues. Did all dailies. Must be a random issue.
---
By Ogden's Hammer!
---
Just got done doing the Triple Threat Group event. A lot of people got the loot, DCed, then lost everything they just got for the event. We're all pretty pissed.
---
i can promise you that is factually false.
---
and "perfect example" is an interesting choice of words
---
can't even log-in, submitted ticket, patch Build 100114
---
error code: 11:1001:8008:207
---
Update release &gt; Server issues.  
---
People thinking of conspiracy. Dude did you ever played after a gw2 update ? It's always buggy and with a really new complex functionality it was predictable.
---
lets say you have a ranger. ranger has a healing build, condi dps build and power dps build. you craft 3 sets of asc gear for each build with trinkets and weapons. now you place them in hero panel in an equipment template separately. you name them templates. you also have build templaces where you seleect the skills/traits and save them with names. now, when you want to swap build, you just click on the template name or assign a shortcut to that. this allows you to separate your gear from inventory if you used the same char for 3 builds. 
---
arcdps is a plugin kinda thing. you can use it to measure dps of your party/squad members, log the rotations to check later, see stuff like boon uptime and other things. it also had templates feature but the gear was just in inventory, arc swapped the gear according to the template you wanted including skills/traits. it had unlimited templates. now, anet brought templates officially, so they made arc stop its template feature. but anet also limited the templates. build templates are 3 per char and equipment templates 2 per char. now, if you had legendary gear, arc can change the stats to unlimited builds. anet templates can only change to 2 stat combos. if you want more, you have to buy from gemstore (per char btw). and with a max of 6 per char, thus it being inferior to arcdps. people angry that now legendary gear is less valuable bcoz people might as well use asc gear sets to store in equipment templates. 1 leg armor set = 2k gold. you can get almost 6+ asc armor sets for that amount and you can just have different skins on all of them :)
---
it works for armor,but your weapons gona be locked in that build. also it removes infusions from leg trinkets for some reason.
---
Build 100114

can't login, submitted ticket
---
Profession Specific Energy is just a catch all phrase not intended as some sort of filler for what Rev Energy is called (it's just energy).  
---
But yeah the bugs for the class are egregious.  That skill reordering was awful (and still is in the few cases it actually happens).
---
Red text on white background does not read well.
---
Friendly reminder: Don't forget to report this bug in an official way too. :)
---
Simple solution: Play support if you can't do good dps. Trust me, you'll be welcomed with open arms.
---
I suck at DPS, so I play support. And I've been happy that way for years.
---
(Though.. I do miss my old chronomancer gameplay..)
---
What? What does buying a build template have to do with being able to share Ascended and Legendary equipment on any character (whose class allows for the specific armor or weapon type)? We can already do that now. The issue is, it's no longer as easy as it once was. If you can't see that, then you are correct, we really can't have an objective, rational discussion...lol
---
Affording as in spending your whole wage on a SINGLE feature?
---
Also buy a permanent bank account and bob's your uncle - you can swap your ascended gear fast for multiple characters any time any place
---
I was within seconds of winning a hard-fought PVP match and I dc'd, didn't get any credit for the win at all. :///
---
Hope my placements don't suffer because of it...
---
If Anet had let hardcores alone with ArcDPS build template but still launch official version for those preferring official solutions, there wouldn't be this much of an uproar. 
---
I was one of those hardcores with tonnes of builds and legendaries. Now I'm left with 3 PvE and 2 equipment stats. Feels like my wings are clipped. Despite that, I'm exercising my right as a consumer and refuse to buy into this bullshit. I just won't be carrying struggling groups as much anymore because fuck switching build manually. 
---
p.s. I do like Anet's implementation to some extent, the free equipment storage, the hot keys to instantly swap builds... but I would give them all up just to have ArcDPS build templates back.
---
&gt; Sometimes you have to scream at them to be heard.  
---
That's it, you summed it up well.  
---
But you know what we cry louder and louder because anet doesn't even communicate with us.
---
Ouch.
---
I mean you're technically correct? But in my mind the word *actual* means a picture taken that's meant to very closely emulate what you see with your naked eye.
---
https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_1024_HMIBC.jpg
---
Doesn't look at all like a *actual picture* to me, just a rendering of some scans.
---
You seem savvy in this area; 
---
Why aren't there any cool pictures of Earth? The only *actual* picture taken of the Earth in it's entirety was taken by the men that went to the moon. 
---
Pictures of the Earth from space would be magical.
---
All we've got is Nasa giving us 3D renders of the Earth based on data &amp; mash up of pictures apparently, and only one actual picture...
---
So you countered my statement on build templates with something that's unrelated then?
---
You will have to manually switch your build whenever you enter the game mode. Previously this was automatic.
---
yep. Was trying to do some halloween content in my limited time for gaming and kept getting booted and losing everything. Sigh.
---
The horror!
---
It's a symptom of the cause/s and possibly a reflection of the game for SOME.
---
Lack of communication, lack of certain content, neglect of some content/communities, uncertainty regarding the game's future, past experiences with the game and company, cannabalist community, frustration at the company.
---
So, ye it's kind of a pit of strife and outrage.
---
You can simply right-click on the build and reset it without using the account tabs.
---
Hahaha.
---
LNHB + Essences are the only criteria worth discussing in-terms of experienced players.  That and maybe the Fractal titles to some extent.  Pots &amp; Food is the "skill-floor" whereas having LNHB/Essences is more towards the "skill-ceiling."  You're upset because players can't fulfill their roles, but your criteria for their general gameplay/performance doesn't require them to play well.  I'm really not sure why you're surprised, lol.  You haven't done anything to weed out inexperienced players and are frustrated that they're inexperienced ?!?!?!
---
Oh but we did, we don't log anymore. Just passing by reminding why.
---
The game is dying. PvP is full of bots and queues are a mess with horrible matchmaking due to the very low population. WvW is a wasteland on most servers apart from friday reset. There's nothing going for it atm. Lfg raids are the biggest waste of time as most groups are "semi-somewhat-casual-trainin-ish" , they are full of leechers and fail to kill anything and getting a strong group on fractals can take up to 20min. Oh wait where are the big communities? Guess what, they all left cause there is nothing for them to do atm. Cause there's nothing rewarding atm in-game apart from make gold-&gt;exchange for gems-&gt; buy skins.
---
U cant have a positive/healthy community if the game itself is in a very unhealthy state. I mean atm the only thing that's actually moving forward is the story and that's it. Everything else is and has been neglected for a long time. Add to that the recent "templates fiasco" and we are in for a shitstorm.
---
Funny that this is your snapping point. They’ve fucked up plenty of times before this.
---
The TL;DR I get from this is "It would take a lot of time (aka money) for a studio like Anet to impliment this properly, so obviously it kind of sucks but be grateful for it."
---
I don't get what you're saying about arcdps though. That people could use it to cheat and swap weapons in combat? And that if Anet used the same method internally then people could cheat too?
---
Pretty rude of them to downvote that. Anyway, they added templates, but they're monetized. You get a few for free and can buy up to like, 6. Problem is that they don't work as well as the Arcdps build templates we were using. They're especially problematic for people with legendaries and the people who do a wide variety of content and are so into the game they really enjoy min/maxing for individual fights and encounters. Also, they made the person running Arcdps turn off the build templates we were able to use(2 weeks before they launched their own version!!), thus alienating their most hardcore players.
---
TL;DR They added monetized build templates but they're only really useful for the people who don't need them and are worse than 3rd party alternative for their most dedicated players.
---
Sigh, I give up...
---
Written in blood
---
They literally could have created a "gear inventory tab" with X amount of slots for armor/weapons/runes/sigils and then implemented something similar to what Arc was except strapped into the actual game code with its own UI.  Instead we got triple monetization complex buggy hell that doesn't even fulfill its intended purpose while trying to re-invent the wheel for no reason
---
&gt;  I love listening to music. I'm not going to stick my dick in a song, though.
---
Ok well, you don't love it do you? You like and enjoy it. And besides, I said two things - mutual obsession and/or necessity to breed. You ignored the first.
---
As for "types" of love, no lol that's not how it works. Just because you can love your dog and your boyfriend in different doesn't mean it's a different thing altogether, you'd be a bit wrong in the head to "love" your dog as you define it and at that point it becomes something unrelated altogether. Nice strawman you made for padding.
---
Besides the point, you're building an argument that's is a complete waste of time - love is a fool's game, that's all you've told me there. It's just as I said, it's very very pointless to bother quantifying and won't be helping you do so any further.
---
This.
---
Plus, ArenaNet literally didn't need to do anything to have a superior solution. ArcDPS was filling the niche, and even came with the caveat emptor warning.
---
It's predatory because ANet offered an inferior solution, forcibly removed the superior solution, and then charged high amounts for the inferior version. If the gem costs were 1/5th what they are now, the complaints wouldn't hold nearly as much water.
---
good talk.
---
This has been a part of games for a while now TBH. It's why I'm really looking forward to TES6, because it's long overdue and it'll go back to the RPG roots I've wanted out of a game in a long time.
---
Also RDR2 on PC should be pretty sick. Can't wait for modders to give us the real game.
---
Bag Slots, Bank Slots and Shared Inventory Slots says hi.
---
&gt; It's like saying that car that you used to drive your arse to work for 7 years is bad because one day you decided that it should also be able to fly.
---
No, it's like when your Super Car X2 comes out and people wonder why it doesn't fly, when your previously released Super Car X did fly, and the designers say "oh well gee, we didn't think you wanted your Super Car X2 flying like the Super Car X did, and we added a bunch of weight in random, structurally important parts of the vehicle so now it's hard for it to fly. BTW, we heard your feedback, and can make it glide down a shit volcano for 500$ a pop".
---
Implying that its parent did.
---
No that's *our* job.
---
^^^^^apparently...
---
I had that and it worked before they added new mounts.
---
Off the top of my head: Z for Gryphon, Ctrl + Z for Raptor, Shift + Z for Skimmer, Alt + Z for Springer,  Ctrl + Shift + Z for Jackal.
---
Now you can add Ctrl + Alt, or Shift + Alt, but you run the risk of hitting Windows key which is no bueno. If you can manage to do that, then you also open up the option of Ctrl + Shift + Alt.
---
The main reason why I avoid using those commands is that usually I'm trying to mount while avoiding combat and running. As such, I need(ed) to be able to use abilities to block while also moving. I can hit the 4 keys with 3 fingers (or 2 if I'm really panicking), but it's not easy. Additionally, Shift + Alt + Z is harder to do than Ctrl + Alt + Z or Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Z.
---
Then again, I didn't use Radial and I haven't unlocked any mount past Gryphon yet. But I do understand the pains.
---
Regarding the amount of work that went into it, it's likely no one was developing this for 1.5 years. Likely that's when they first mocked something up and pulled it into their backlog. Maybe they pushed it back several times, or just never planned on getting to it until now in the first place. Maybe they started it, ran into a big problem, and pushed it back until they could find time to solve that problem.
---
There's no reason that the limits would be driven by technical concerns. This stuff likely isn't bound to database columns, anyway, everything gets its own row. It was probably either UI real estate or they simply picked numbers based on what they thought players wanted/needed.
---
I have very little faith in *any* dev (sadly, not even in myself), but in this particular scenario there's no reason to think that's the cause of anything.
---
[You are correct](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1189585576900648960)
---
Pretty much my conclusions as well.  
---
For legends maybe down the line they can create a ghost function that will let you remove the legend from a character and the slots will retain a ghost/echo of all the choices you had for the legendary.  Then when you re-equip that legendary it will reapply your previous choices.  So long as you don't put a different pieces into those slots the ghost info remains. Making it easier to swap legendaries like they did before.  
---
The system just came out.  To my way of thinking our energies would be better spent  recognizing the limitations of the systems and either building 3rd party solutions like the chat code storage or asking anet to make revisions or build additional systems to ease some of the rougher parts.
---
It is honestly sad how willfully ignorant and obtuse you were, but good talk I guess.
---
Best of luck with your endeavours mate.
---
That seems even easier
---
I get your point now , I kinda see how its partly my fault now. The reason I mentioned them having full pots,boons (not sure if I mentioned food but some of the encounter they have some sort of dps food as well). If they are what they claim to be (dps) having all those mentioned, they shouldn't have any problem hitting at least 10k on stationary boss with no or minimal cc e.g (golem mini boss in uncat) (slime boss)/consistently throughout the whole run. But personally i dont really care what you have or dont if you can do a decent dps
---
This is a joke, this is terrible, this should have been free, nobody wants this, blah blah blah, this is bullshit, this should have been free, you should have given us more of everything, etc etc etc.  Whatever.
---
a lot of people prefer tab combat vs action combat
---
"all of this should have been given to us for free" is rational, mmmhmm
---
Yes, Anet went there and directly charged for an UI upgrade. Thats just how the business model is.
---
I know, its become a bad joke, but... really... vote with your wallet. If you want the industry to change, then stop going for the f2p-charge-me-to-starving-with-mtx business model games.
---
There's subfees mmos out there. Play those instead.
---
Theres a HUGE indie games market for everything singleplayer without mtx.
---
Pay an honest price for the videogame you are going to enjoy for hours upon hours - instead of always waiting for the discounts.
---
Might not change big shareholder companys, but at least you wont have to make outraged reddit posts about legitimate business models anymore.
---
&gt; We have no control over the votes and I believe making good and bad feedback threads wouldn't solve much because there are just so many unique issues and thoughts going around on both sides. Plus Reddit only gives us 2 pinned posts.
---
Yeah, I also wouldnt choose, which posts to remove and which ones to leave based on upvotes and downvotes or doing a positive/negative mega-thread each. Both wont work.
---
But your sticky posts could have been handled better. As you mentioned, you only have two of them but even though they are a great moderation tools, if you use them correctly. You only had one active when the patch launched and when you made a 2nd one a day later, it was locked.
---
The term "moderation" is often used in a negative meaning here and sometimes put on the same level as silencing opinions or straight out censorship. But what it should be is streamlining a discussion, like moderating a debate, its up to the mods to try to create a healthy discussion. 
---
Just because you make a megathread or sticky for a certain theme or issue and remove individual posts doesnt mean those posts are censored as they are free to post it in the megathread.
---
Stickies and megathreads are meant to mainly help the moderators because they are way easier to moderate compared to a flood of individual posts in your sub, like you have it now.
---
I dont think anybody was particularly surprised, given recent history, that another circle-jerk would spring to life here once build templates release or that a major update to the game system like would come along with plenty of bugs and server crashes.
---
If you decide not to make a sticky for general build template feedback, (in hindsight) it would have been a great idea to at least have a patch bug sticky, where players could have posted bugs they encounter, workarounds or warnings for triggered server crashes or disconnects and have one mod skim all the comments and summarize them in the OP. That would be helpful to most players because they only need to read the OP in order to keep up to date with that stuff instead of having to read all the comments themselves every time they want to check for new bugs/info or like now, have to try to find those individual bug/server crash in a flood of personal build template rants where the OP doesnt really say anything that hasnt been said or read dozens of times before. And a good moderated and updated bug thread is maybe something even Anet devs may have a look at here.
---
For personal feedback from players towards a new patch, regardless wether they find it good or bad, I would use the link post of the official patch notes. Most of the time, they are posted instantly by one of your users but i would remove that post and have one of the moderators repost it (so they get replies to their inbox) and make a sticky comment inside that thread where you explain, what kind of feedback you would like have posted in that thread and what kind of discussion warrants its own post. The patch note thread is usually upvoted so much, that it will stay around the top of the front page for at least a day, even more, if you can manage to keep most of the personal feedback inside that thread.
---
That thread would probably only need moderation in terms of personal attacks, derailing, etc.
---
All the feedback towards pricing of build templates I also would have streamlined into one post, either use gem store blog post link thread for it or make your own as moderator.
---
With that set up, you would have had one sticky for weekly questions, one sticky for bug reports/server crashes, one patch update notes link post from a moderator on top as a hot topic for personal feedback and another one for gem pricing. 
---
Thats the 4 main topics regarding this game update and most players probably have an opinion/feedback about each of them. But since there are no dedicated threads for them, they just put their personal opinions/feedback on all 4 of them into a new post und you end up with hundreds of posts from different users that basically say the same and everybody echoing what they already stated in their own posts in each others posts.
---
&gt; You make a lot of good points rude and many are things I think about a lot. This job has gotten a lot harder over the past few months and I am always trying to come up with ideas to make the sub a better place because I do still want to love and play the game.
---
Thanks. I can imagine it got a lot harder to moderate, partly because of general decisions made by Anet which disgruntled the vocal part of the community but also, as you have mentioned, there is always space for improvement for moderation and from my point of view, that was also slacking in the past few months. And I dont mean any of the mods specifically, just the combined outcome resulting from your efforts.
---
Community building is a hard task and often ungrateful labor, thats true in real life (politicians), in game (guild leaders) and especially online (you mods), where community members can hide behind the anonymity of the internet, so I wont fault you for it if you dont do a perfect job. 
---
I got some more feedback on the middle part of your post but its getting late here, so i will see about that tomorrow, have a good night/day.
---
the skill is also 6 initiative now, utter fucking garbage
---
well, if you need to remind yourself why you dont do something anymore, it means you havent found anything better to do yet.
---
Finally someone who gets my point
---
If they didn't ban you for using Arc build templates no one would be mad. They might be laughing at them for doing a worse job than a fan mod but no one would be angry, or negatively effected like this. They shot themselves in the foot with their own greed.
---
I use a steam controller to play, so bindings are at a premium.  When there were only four mounts (it's going to be a long time before I bother finishing the griffon), I had them all on the left pad with a modifier, but now that there's 8 and no sign of stopping it's way better to use the radial.
---
For the keyboard, others have said stuff but here's my take: sure, you *could* devote and work on remembering eight (and increasing) keybinds all to mounts that you realistically only use two of 95% of the time... or you devote one bind and just move your mouse in the appropriate direction.
---
Anet listen to this man! Hire him!
---
I am really confused about your feedback on equipment templates. Like I understand what you mean that in a ideal world they revamp the entire system and combine statprefix/runes with a specific build as you can swap them on demand on legendary.
---
But I have no clue how it would work with any armor but legendary. You put rune of Force in your template, but if you don't have it then what? 
---
And if you don't have multiple armors aside from that 1 set with which I kind of take away is your image of a average non rich player? Then there is no point even have that part in template, as they can only choose the 1 thing they have.
---
Like I am just blown away by that feedback and can't even begin to wrap my head around whatever you suggest.
---
For me personally the equipment tab is a god blessing, and even though I hate how it interacts with un-equipping legendary (basically puts it back to fresh out of forge state removing all runes/sigils etc.) and also hate the upgrades are character bound. It still is the only thing I am happy for.
---
As pretty much every off my 20 alts for some reason seem to have 2 sets, mostly because I can't get myself to destroy that stupid celestial set for my ele. Or feel like for every class should have a slightly more tanky alternative if something is hard. And even if they only have the 1 zerker template I still was able to get rid of some of the other weapons in the new tab by storing it there. Heck could put some ascended trinket on bank characters for free without taking more inventory space =) (I am an hoarder)
---
More feedback on the equipment is they basically made legendary armor soul bound. Putting it in bank resets everything plus have to transfer the stupid infusions and runes with it. So putting it back after that raid encounter on the main user is far from fun. Might as well not play mesmer anymore until I get a separate ascended armor.
---
The easy but potentially really hard fix is to make the extra storage aside from the first one account wide, I would pay like 2 K gems for it. It might be tricky with the 3 different armor classes and weapons are also part of the same template. But would even happily pay for each armor type separate. And can make it so you can only put account bound items(read ascended) in it with a big warning before unlocks. If you miss a piece like backpiece or even helmet it would equip the character first package item.
---
Or maybe a more simpler solution would be to use the copy paste thing that for some reason already exist. You can copy a armor template and paste it on the same character. What if you can copy it across to another character but with a big ! this item is on "CHARACTER NAME". Don't know how technology goes but could go several ways. If you like swap the weapon the old one could just go to the currently active characters inventory like a bank. Or just stop any kind of interaction with the items. You just copy the armor and maybe trinkets but leave the weapons empty. That way can customize it for the other characters class. Really often would use the exact same set up like zerker with scholar at it's base.
---
I would even pay 500 gems to unlock a extra slot on my ele which has my legendary armor to put some diviner and pack runes combo on it. Only to have it as a copy template for my mesmer.
---
Thanks for making me feel even worse at running the stupid thing.  I can't even get half way up the tower constantly.  
---
Congrats though.  Great job
---
To be honest, I don't mind them charging for equipment slots Maybe baseline should've been 3 slots instead of 2. Regardless... I'm not offended by it.
---
What I **am** offended by is them unironically charging for the build templates save list. WTF!?
---
I just want to weigh on your commentary about the equipment templates. There was an alternative to the monetization issue and limitation of tabs - they could simply set the templates to link to certain items in the inventory. If the user moved the item to the bank, other character or otherwise removed it from that character's they could show a warning that a piece of equipment was not found. We wouldn't need to buy new tabs, as they would simply store "linked" items, without storing them in the ether. Then add a save button, a reset button (to load the original template) and the system would be golden.
---
There must be a motive you aren't looking at that drive this change, then. I really don't think it was monetization, because a system designed to be monetized would be polished much better and designed to extract money better than this. There is no ease into monetization on this system and the cap is way too low.
---
I've posted elsewhere, but I think that the main driver for implenting this was to move the liability of the template system from counting on a community member maintaining a tool that requires an update after every game patch to counting on an internal team maintaining a internal functionality.
---
I believe that this was risk mitigation. What would happen to the raiding community if arcdps shut down unexpectedly (see Dulfy) and there was no functional alternative? Seeing that risk, I wouldn't put much money into raid development until templates were internalized either.
---
Now, something I have less faith in... If I was in charge, I would use the revenue flow of templates to drive an increase of budget on both improved templates and raids, but I would have also comminicated more openly than anet did about all of this.
---
I got a lot of disconnects (15) in a row, with rollbacks each time. I then tested it by gathering in a patch, and on returning after dc 16, all the plants were back there. Sadly the game is unplayable atm, so I'm here reading others having the same experience.
---
What are you still doing in GW2, OP? Didn't the developers make it abundantly clear that your kind is not welcome here?   
---
The idea that you too are entitled to playing the game as you wish is simply unbearable for the folks around here.
---
Because changing a template page, by the game's code, is literally un-equipping the skill and re-equipping it again, which would put it on cooldown.
---
Im just on Reddit to troll and watch the drama.
---
I actually play the game and have fun.
---
You can't take Reddit seriously. This is like that dark corner where everyone goes to pee. It is meaningless but keeps all negativity in that corner. It is rare to see negativity outside reddit.
---
You don't have to bind it in order to do the reforging. As a heads up, if you do soulbind it, you will need to reforge it on the character its bound to.   
---
It doesn't sound like that's a concern for you, but I wound up soulbinding it on an alt that hadn't completed HoT story and it was an inconvenience. :o
---
As any QA tester in any field will tell you, the real QA starts when the product is released into the wild. 
---
You have 50-100 people in a somewhat controlled environment and you do as many random permutations as you can, then 1,000,000 people get access to it and situations arise that you couldn't test for or think of because the real world is just chaotic as all hell.
---
Only Mesmers are allowed to be cheesy.
---
fair points. I've never really needed to swap equipment much so I don't have much feed back, I just felt there needs to be a better bridge between equipment and traits. set it up so it's closer to a literal one-button-swap system.
---
&gt;  Just like Microsoft, doesn't expect users to try restart their computers during a Windows Update. 
---
Man analogy as everybody has done this somewhere down the line, thats why the OS will normally reboot on the old version or repair the OS on next boot up before attempting it again. (power outages and shit.)
---
something newly released that interacts with every facet of the game breaks in 24 of it launching it? 
---
No fucking shit!
---
You have already been borderline breaking our rules on attacking other users for a couple weeks now, do you really want to push it? Consider this a final warning.
---
kinda surprised it was only worked on 2 years. They were investigating build templates for a while. Anet's Evan Lesh had a post about it back in 2014, asking for people's input on what features they'd want a template system to have. Strangely, that forum post seems to have disappeared, though you can still see places like Dulfy that referenced his post.
---
QoL things have always been monetized, this is nothing new
---
Yea, much of this is what I meant by 
---
&gt; Every chance they had to decouple shit, they instead piled more crap into it.
---
Aesthetics (skins and auras), progress (total raw stats, agony), and build (skills, traits, stat distributions) are different areas of concern and needed to be separated. They werent. They were all coupled to each other and any change to one was hindered by all of the other existing systems.
---
Remember when Colin used to chant "Rapid Iteration! Rapid Iteration! Rapid Iteration!"? I remember thinking the itemization design was bad back then. Now? LOL
---
If you're relying on TES6 to bring you back to RPG roots then you're probably gonna be let down, Skyrim is barely a RPG as it is
---
Try Outer Worlds, thats a proper modern RPG
---
Yeah, at the moment there aren't any restrictions. Honestly it makes the game more fluid and unpredictable. I can't tell if thats a good thing or not yet, but there it is.
---
&gt;An exact copy of the GW1 system would have been great.
---
This sums up a lot of how I feel about this game
---
Not sure why you're so surprised or didnt expect this. 
---
It was a known fact that this would happen when they released it and only allowed ArcDPS as a filler till they did. Just like bag space, they know they can make money and for a free to play mmo, its to be expected. They gotta make money after all, though it would likely be more acceptable if the game didn't have loot boxes. Though on another front, are you gonna quit the game or are you gonna buy those templates. I'd wager you're gonna cave and buy those templates due to the sheer amount of time you've invested which is what Anet's marketing wants most likely.
---
Also gotta make sure you don't lump ALL of Anet with this choice, the intern getting the coffee doesn't make this call and most of the people in the office don't have a say. Don't flame the whole of Anet for the choices of upper management. 
---
Expecting downvotes cause people don't wanna hear this despite it being true.
---
&gt; you always had to manually transfer gear between characters if you wanted to share it.
---
The difference is that arcdps could remember your build (or not?).
---
If you have 6 equipement builds right now on one character and move the legendary armor all 6 builds have to be "forgotten" (at least all legendary parts) and when you move the armor back you have to manually select the correct stats for every single build again.
---
Solution: don't PUG and only run with people you trust
---
It's sad that we actually have to explain this to people, especially when we're the ones being called "children" who supposedly don't understand how the world works.
---
Good grief.
---
As usual rude you make very good points. I know you get a decent amount of hate around here but personally I've always enjoyed your insight. 
---
It's been tough. For the last few months it's a constant feeling of damned if we do damned if we don't because the anger is real, and a lot of it justified. We don't want this to be the forums but I also don't blame people for being upset when everything is negative even if it's justified. And then of course the mod team is volunteers, we all have lives outside of this and sometimes things will slip through the cracks often. 
---
I really wish we were able to have more than 2 pinned posts and that really would solve a lot of problems we have often on this sub and I'm sure many other subs have the same issue when there are so many things to discuss. Yes of course we could just make the threads but easy for them to disappear quickly especially with so many posts and then it's difficult to force people into those posts as many still want to have their say. Last thing we want to do is disable new posts as well. For right now we are going to leave it as is but I am grateful for your ideas and feedback. 
---
We most likely will be making a megathread by the end of the week once all the major discussion has died down and we'll try to keep that going as long as we can.

They could have mitigated that risk by providing an API and letting the community do the work. We already know that deltaconnected was leveraging some functions to set traits/skills and equip items. Anet could have made those stable and document them.
---
Look at the mumble API : it is stable and lets the community develop around it.
---
Additionaly, anet was petfectly fine with building the api (the one used by gw2efficiency) and letting the community do the heavy lifting of building tools. This affords them the ability to limit access to the game's data (like showing items only if someone has discovered them first) and saves them the hassle of having to maintain said tools.
---
My point is that I highly doubt it was risk mitigation of any kind. I think they wanted to deliver something the playerbase always wanted, but way too late, whilst a community tool existed already, and sprinkled with the worst monetization they could come up with.
---
Bye

Please this reply should be in first position 😂😂😂

Yes, just make sure you're buying from a credible source!

Why won't anyone think of the poor veterans being relentlessly abused by evil overlord ANet???
---
&gt; nor am I writing this to white knight them.
---
/&gt; argues that people aren't allowed to make negative comments
---
Yea, you are.
---
Skyrim still has the bare minimum features to be able to be considered an RPG but Bethesda's trend of dumbing things down for every new release makes it hard for me to be optimistic about TES6
---
I just hope Fo4 and Fo76 were some kind of wakeup call for them
---
Yep, this whole thing reeks of ineffective compromise between tech and non-tech.
---
The non-tech people (design/business) had some kind of spec that probably wasn't entirely possible due to engine limitations. The devs probably had some idea how to make an effective system based on engine limitations, but it differed from the spec on key points that non-tech people weren't willing to compromise on.
---
As a result, we ended up with some awful twisted version of the original spec that adheres to some arbitrary and unimportant deliverables set by non-tech people but misses the point of the feature. Non-tech people are probably blaming the bad PR on the devs who failed to match the original spec, and the devs are in turn shifting blame onto the engine because that was their justification for differing from the original spec.
---
Someone was probably arguing for a sensible implementation that fit the technology constraints and solved the problem, but they were ultimately ignored because they don't have decision making power.
---
Raid uses full harrier.
---
Fractal uses harrier, minstrel or a combination, and Potions have nothing to do with it. 
---
What does change is traits and skills, but you already have infinite builds with notepad.
---
As for the qb thing... Are you seriously saying than swapping 1 weapon and keeping the rest the same requires a whole new gear template???
---
How can one person be so wrong
---
Sounds like a conspiracy theory started by people desperate to hate on Blizzard
---
Also the scandal getting worse and worse? It was already resolved, the only people still whining about it are the people who are going to try to get into Blizzcon dressed as Winnie the Pooh
---
Just having multiple ascended sets was more convenient anyway before arcdps templates.
---
6 clicks and you changed all 6 armor pieces. Legendary armor however was multiple clicks and scrolling per piece AND you had to remember which stats and runes each piece had.
---
And now ascended sets are once again "better". Anet really hates legendary armor. They never really were convenient (without addons) and they still can't be properly dyed even though they have only 3 dye slots. (Talking about the raid legendary armor)
---
I used to work in software development (years’ experience).  I think there’s two issues here.  
---
The first issue is that the GW2 Development Team are out of touch with the general player base.  In software development it’s extremely important to have a clear understanding of the user requirements, specifically how they the use the system.  I’ve seen big software projects fail simply because “they think it’s what the user needs” rather than find out “what the user actually need”.  It’s the first task of a big software project, you get the Business Analyst to find out what the user “actually needs” and turn that into a business requirements document.  
---
The second issue is that old technology or monetisation is not really an excuse not to deliver a quality product.  Some of the applications I used to support in my old job were old mainframe applications that used terrible programming languages on a shoestring budget.  Despite this, we’d still deliver a bleeding edge solution using stuff the .NET platform, C# and SQL (we’d build modern stuff to hook into the old stuff).  
---
Lastly I think the gaming industry has a whole tends to suffer from bad processes and workflows.  I highly doubt Arena Net use best practice methodologies like Agile or ITIL, which would have prevented a lot of the problems GW2 suffer from.  Heck I doubt they have strategies for managing technical debt or even work instructions.
---
wonder if they'll make a presentation to announce the 4 new build template slots
---
Part of me compartmentalizes those from this purely because this is considered a very basic part of the UI in other games, but I'm not overly fond of \*those\*, either.
---
Character-specific microtransactions just feel like a massive waste of money when everything else is so alt-friendly.
---
The word missing from this is NCSOFT
---
I have 100% the same thoughts, even planned to write my own farewell open letter, but never bothered to do that. Friends list is practically empty, last of the statics, which still survived up until this point, disbanded in summer. People we're so tired that even wing 7 kept us in game only for a few weeks. I don't see any future in this game, just because of the free nature of it. If business model revolves around getting people back into the game for a few days once every few months and catering to casuals to grab the widest spectre of potential players, this by no means is the game which you can really stick to. Bleeding veterans is inevitable, it's all part of their plan. You had your share of fun - now go somewhere else, just don't forget to log in thrice a tear for the new gemshop outfits.
---
Honestly, this is a damn shame. Game is great, but it's a huge monument to wasted potential. If they got their heads out of their butts, they could have made an ultimate mmo to just destroy the whole market. There's a clear demand, which is vastly unfulfilled.
---
Forgive my limited knowledge of direct development, but Delta’s features just worked. They required setup by the player which seemed straightforward to enable templates. (RIP ctrl+alt+shift+D)
---
What was to stop arenanet from adopting the system versus having to build their own system? They may be able to see what worked and make it better instead of starting from scratch. 
---
Further, if Dev payment is built into $400+ costing (account wide) to make this new system work, wouldn’t they have more options versus an independent dev? Why not consider paying Delta for their code and having an independent dev support sale to make up costs (SWTOR would recognize Dulfy for her contributions, why not arenanet)? I would throw down money as an inactive, previous T4 CM fractals on 8 character + weekly  wvw player with friends when I can (because there is no monthly fee) + open world and event  player if Arenanet was taking a huge hit for this. Especially in lieu if a new dlc.
---
How many people are going to need all of the equipment slots and build slots for all of their characters? Sure, you can do it, but that's the same as saying that you have to buy 30+ character slots in GW2 before you can compare it with FF14. That argument completely ignores the fact that you lose access to one when you stop paying.
---
How would it be $20 if it's for $55 on the official site?? That sounds sketchy..
---
my soul can speak to this on an emotional level
---
I did play FFXIV.
---
Anet considered 500 crafting as a major expansion release, so I can only imagine that templates has to have been a pretty big deal for them... the only thing we are getting now is the first LS chapter as far as I know.
---
Heart of Thorns, the essence of new difficulty and new content, was absolutely a blessing for the game. I don't want to write off what it did for the game, and even though I'm pointing out its flaws, I absolutely agree that its upsides outweigh the flaws.
---
Heart of Thorns was at roughly the same time as the reconstruction of LA, and I feel like these two events, even while HoT was a good addition, marked the beginning of the downfall and the end of Guild Wars 2's golden era.
---
Also, yes, it has always obviously been a business, but the difference is between a business who only wants profit and cares about nothing else versus a company who makes something because they're passionate about it. The latter listens to their playerbase and tried to make legitimate improvements to the game, and is still allowed things like keys. Because one lootbox that isn't central to the game is fine, especially when you could farm them through quests without paying money. But now it's getting bogged down in them, and Anet is starting to feel more like it's drifting closer and closer to the former - a cold, uncaring company whose only aim is to get as much money as they can without regard to the playerbase.
---
To each his own. I would quit immediately if they added a sub. The problem with the build templates is that they don't offer a premium option for the heavy users. The pricing model is fine for the very casual players but poor for the heavy duty players like the people that frequent this sub.
---
Can confirm
---
&gt;The only thing they cared about was chanting "iterative design" (manager  lingo for figure it out later) leading into and through season one.
---
Not manager lingo, it's a pretty common developer practice today. Not so much in game development, which seems to be stuck in the dark ages of development processes, but that's exactly how we work. Rarely, if ever, are there large code changes at all (except when we finally get to remove 1000s of lines of legacy code that we finally replaced). Much of our work is released in iterations. Our most recent features that our team worked on were not released in big, flashy releases, but as smaller iterative forms of the features. Allowing us to get code out early and adjust based on internal/external feedback. Just because we took feedback didn't mean we changed anything either, sometimes what the customer asks for simply won't work for what we are trying to offer. We know we don't fit for everyone and so we don't try to.
---
What ANet has done with Living World and their Feature releases has been very similar to this. Despite two expansions, I think the LW releases have generally been better quality content (and features) than what we got in the Expansions. It's not a big or flashy as releasing expansions, but LW has given them the ability to iterate much better than any other game I've played. They've also managed to keep the game online and running almost consistently for most players since 2012 (I can think of only one outage).
---
been playing GW since '06.
---
It's good to be wary but DLGamer is an [official retailer](https://www.guildwars2.com/retailers/) which are the only places you should be buying the game from. The game [on the official site is only $30](https://buy.guildwars2.com) so you're saving $10 by getting it on sale. The $55 version has an outfit, a character slot, and a lounge pass. It's not really worth it IMO. If you wanted to get the $70 version ($30 game + $50 of gems) then you kind of get the extras for "free" assuming you planned on getting that many gems anyways so I'd go with that *if* you plan to spend that much already. Otherwise gems are never discounted and don't get cheaper for buying more.
---
I played WOW for a number of years and I would go so far as to say that the sub model goes so far as to encourage people to spend more time in game to get value for their money. For people like me and my kids, a sub just makes no sense. I haven't finished half of what is already in GW2. I have done about half the dungeons, I am level 3 in fractals and I haven't set foot in a raid. I still have JP's to complete, etc. My kids play less than me. I won't return to the sub model. I understand the allure and the benefits but they aren't for everyone.
---
What I described is how Mordrem are made as confirmed by developers. So it stands to reason sylvari are the same. Especially since the Pale Tree wouldn't convert animal flesh to plant materials as Mordremoth is also willing to do (Mordrem Trolls and Mordrem Wolves).
---
The launch trailer also shows a mordrem guard being born in that fashion - nearby plant life being pulled and warped darker and compressing into the form of a sylvari / Mordrem guard.
---
Sylvari are descripted precisely as being made of compressed vines and leaves just like that trailer shows too, and have been since pre release interviews. Despite being called "fruits of the Pale Tree" they're more like highly comoressed vine creatures. Compressed and covered with leaves so as to simulate human form (compressed leaves = skin, loose leaves = ~~paper~~ hair, wood = bones, and sap = blood).
---
Are there multiple dps meters available? 
---
BGDM is obviously gone/banned. The one that reads combat log is sketchy at best. I know some guilds have private ones, but I'm not sure they are available to the public.  I'll totally believe you if you can send me a link to another.  
---
Also it sounds like your trying to say dps meters are TOS compliant.  They are not, reading game memory isn't tos compliant, but just like build templates, if you use them without being a bad person, its fine.
---
Your suggestion is basically making everything 66% cheaper, setting the max amount of templates to 18 and adding an autoload when changing a game mode.
---
Anet reads "66% cheaper" and says "No."
---
I mean it would be great it if they just made it much cheaper and increased the limits but for some reason they went with the prices and limits we have right now.
---
That's super unfortunate. I used Build and Equipment templates in GW1 and it was so convenient because I could easily switch out builds. That's total trash they are putting something like that behind a pay wall- Thank you for your answer, it was super helpful!
---
I might be thinking of a different game then, hang on and let me check...
---
Yeah, not sure what I was thinking of, sorry. I'll go redact that post.
---
I didn't get anything for free.  I happily pay for content that is worthwhile.  I paid $60 for the base game, i paid for HOT, and i paid for the upgraded version of POF.
---
QOL Improvements should be free, but I wouldn't be opposed to paying a fair price for them.  $350 to fill out your account and characters with max template slots is pushing it.  It hurts your dedicated playerbase, which is going to leave this game with nothing but f2p people that find theres nobody to group with once they hit end game.
---
&gt;Further, if Dev payment is built into $400+ costing (account wide) to  make this new system work, wouldn’t they have more options versus an  independent dev? 
---
Using just the average Game Dev pay in Bellevue, WA, *one* day of *one* dev's work is about $480.... not counting benefits cost or future maintenance costs (you have to assume on-going costs for all development as well, not just up to release). It's quite expensive to develop even something that appears "simple" like build templates can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop depending on how much time it takes. And believe me, things are *rarely* ever as simple as they look on the surface. Users generally interact with very little of a game or application's code. A frontend makes up a LOT of code, but the backend makes up most of the work. I just got off a single ticket, a single "task", that took three weeks due to legacy code and relationships that we couldn't break while developing this.
---
MTX and DLC are just as much about covering development costs as it is about making money for a company. Companies like mine survive with on-going payments as our customers pay for a subscription to use our platform. ANet (and most game companies) don't have that kind of revenue stream and they are scared to raise base prices, so instead, they tried MTX/DLC and it worked so well that we have the shitshow we see in gaming today.
---
MMOs, like GW2, are among the *most* expensive types of games to develop and maintain as it has no obvious "end of life" and takes far more than just Game Developers to build it. They need network engineers, Systems Engineers, etc - all of which are expensive. Add in huge on-going costs (relatively speaking). It's one of the reasons they started as Pay to Play games.
---
Thanks for your valuable input.
---
playing since release, have done that 0 times
---
cya.
---
The feels. Just recently did my local EB Games mention they haven't had the cards in ages and went so far as to say they probably "can't" get them in any more. Yikes. It's bad enough for us with the sh*tty conversion rates... sigh.
---
Well, you have good points there. I do think dps meters are very important to raids, but less critical than templates. They probably feel like the golem meter is adequate to mitigate the loss of external meters.
---
&gt;Disclaimer - I'm unsure whether Arc templates "always worked fine", but I  definitely haven't heard any complaints, or at least not as much as I'm  hearing about ANet templates.
---
There's no way to actually have accurate/valid data on this as the tool was used by a relatively small subset of the player base. Smaller than I'm guessing the in-games ones will. I hear a lot of complaints about the ANet feature, but many of those come from former Arc users, which goes back to my first sentence - not enough of the overall player base used Arc templates to get accurate data.
---
I used them, had issues with build missing skills, traits or gear (especially after an update) and just stopped using it.
---
It's true - the comparison is a bit of a moot point, as there isn't enough data. But we do know that Arc's implementation makes it impossible to actually cause real harm, like what Anet templates are doing (exploits, bugs, items/infusions getting lost, server issues).
---
And, in the end, Arc's problems are imperfections and minor bugs- and perhaps they could be fixed with a proper team of devs working on it, rather than one person in their spare time.
---
&gt;saying before they will happily pay for build templates?
---
resonable priced and functioning good probably.
---
not for this greedy mess.
---
In PvE too. I keep thinking random people are in my squad/party because of the blue name.
---
Don't assume what "feels like it does damage" actually does damage.  By the time you get to T3/T4 you have a responsibility to have some perspective; and ArcDPS helps players assess their perforamnce.

&gt; This is most commonly caused by firewall or router settings, security applications, or connecting through a campus network.
---
If you only do T4 then you wont have a good time. Most CM groups run CM and then T4. Furthermore, there is zero incentive for people who can do CM's to run non-CM groups since you can only run T4 once per day. What this results in is that most people who actually know fractals well and can perform to some decent degree get KP and only run CMs. This has formed a rift in the fractal population in that, before, you would have random good players mixed in with normal or poor fractal players; now, almost all the good players only do CM and that leaves mostly normal to poor fractal players in non-CM. 
---
Long story short, if you think youre better than the average player, youll have to move up to CMs. Breaking into CMs is pretty tough though as most groups dont really work well until you can get inot the 100ess groups. Having zero essence basically means you have to form your own groups of similarly zero ess players also trying to break into CMs. Get ready for lots of 2 hour 100CMs or even just getting stuck on MoMA because breaking into CMs is a bit of a filter for players. But, if you stick with it, eventually youll be able to get into 20ess groups, which are at least somewhat familiar with the mechanics; then the 50ess groups, which will likely get the fractals done, but youll still have a good number of poor performers; and finally, break into 100ess groups, which (for the most part) are fairly smooth running groups.
---
Most people dont really want to do the above, and a lot of the complaints youll read about are basically that, including suggesting some way to force the better players to group with the less skills players.
---
Damage control
---
Delta literally said it in his developer note that if gw2 ever makes build template official, he would remove it. Wym??? Do me a favor and do more research before talking pls.
---
"And also, my favorite Quagan costume is the Pink Ribbon Quaggan"
---
only if that was 5 build templates per character at a minimum, i think you are seriously understimating how many builds raiders, wvw players and other hardcore pve players use.any one of my main characters easily has 5 major build variants.
---
I think there are some legitimate complaints about the Templates system, but the hair on fire rheeeeeeing over it is just hilariously out of proportion, and the raid/PvP/WvW portions of the community have way too high an impression of their own value to the game. What matters to them is not what matters to the game as a whole, and they need to understand that.
---
Not to be a downer but it follows the same bullshit power creep-vertical treadmill model that GW2 is so well known for avoiding. Great shooter but the progression design is absolutely awful and just drives me back to GW2 despite being in a completely different genre.
---
Software devs love eagle in their Reddit names.
---
Just an observation haha
---
The design isn't great, especially for people who need to make use of a lot. It would be better if they had some sort of pricing like the BL keys with an unlimited option. For the majority of players, the pricing probably works. Those aren't people that frequent here so you get a skewed view in this reddit.
---
The point is that the models are different and can't be compared.
---
I really feel they could have copy pasted Build templates of basically ANY GAME. And thatd would have been a better job...
---
Runescape. Wow. Tera. Those Are decent.
---
The fact that they removed the wvw autoswitch really disapointed me. I tought I would have wvw tabs only. Surprise.
---
If you played all game modes before this...
---
Now you must change builds (and armor) to do pvp daily, switch again to do WvW, and switch a 3rd time to go back to pve.
---
I used to do ALL that by only switching outpost before.
---
Oh and now they also added bugs..
---
So yeah it’s a lot more hassle if you play ALL 3 game modes.
---
(Try que for pvp while you wait for meta = lots of fucking build and equip switching that before was instant and changed right back when you switch)
---
So yeah as I said and I agree.. this is bs and only made the game suck for people who actually played the whole game (pvX players)
---
Who is white knighting? The pricing is probably reasonable for the very casual person but is very bad for the serious players. That's not the same as someone popping in and saying (paraphrasing) "come and join FFXIV where the templates are free" when it's not free at all. You need to pay a sub every month. How on earth can something be free if you have to pay for it and, to make matters worse, if you don't keep paying then you have to stop using it. You are effectively renting those build templates.
---
Can't blame NCSOFT for this one. It's because of them that Anet has refocused on the game itself rather than deceiving us with pseudo-maintenance mode while they wasted resources on projects that went nowhere.
---
i think it should be enabled only for certain types of content with greatly diminished/NO rewards. henchmen are practice mode for those with social anxiety and confidence issues with unfamiliar content.
---
final fantasy 14's newest expansion added something similar to henchmen and those dungeons are still thriving in terms of player groups.
---
Anet will never change anything to make it cheaper. Their go-to reason will be it's unfair to those who have paid for items in the past.
---
The fact that there's empty space to the right of the 6 tabs, that could fit exactly 4 more tabs would make the statement even funnier.
---
And you completely ignored the post that I replied to where the person said that build templates were free with FFXIV which is factually incorrect because you have to pay a sub.
---
I think that is a tough question to answer, especially because of the way you phrased it.  'losing'.  As in the state of the game today, and the impact it would have if dps meters were gone tomorrow.  
---
I think right at the release of hot, dps meters would have been clearly more important.  Build templates are for swapping builds, but dps meters are for creating them (testing to see if they are good). Coming into hot, pve players knew how to do a 10 second burst (dungeons), they were not at all prepared for a 5-10 minute encounter.  
---
But your asking about the state of the game right now.  If dps meters leave the game tonight, we still have all the prior knowledge we gained from them.  The establishment of a meta, what builds work best where, that stuff we still keep.  What we lose is the ability to evaluate our performance in a raid. 
---
But that is an extremely important ability for players early on in their raiding lives. When hot first released, not many groups did gorse no-updrafts. This was because before guilds like qt made rotation videos, many of us didn't even know a real rotation. In fact, seasoned vets had learned their best 10 second burst for dungeons leading to hot, but extended rotations were quite new territory. Entire raid strategies changed because of players evaluating their own performance, and learning how to deal damage.  
---
If there were no dps meters, players would use the dps golem (which I am assuming also no longer has the official Anet dps meter in this scenario).  They would simply time their kills to figure out if they know their rotations.  So, new players would still have the ability to learn how to use their class.  So that vital tool would remain.  But in raid performance evaluation, would be entirely gone.
---
Before arc build templates, I remember people having multiple characters and using them as builds instead.  I knew several warriors who had a power and condi warrior, two seperate characters.  I have a friend who had 2 druids, 1 condi and 1 magi.  
---
So overall, the removal of build templates can (albeit frustratingly) be made up for through multiple characters and manually changing gear.  However, being able to evaluate your performance in a raid, without dps meters, it is quite difficult to do.  I remember people use to record themselves raiding to improve, but that was a pretty small chunk of the population.  
---
So, if you put a gun to my head, and force me to choose, which do I think is more important to the community?  I think, dps meters.  dps meters just can't be replaced through anything else in game, but build templates can be replaced with character select.
---
Fuckin T R A G E D Y! Disgrace! Blasphemy! They should be perma banned!
---
What do you view as the worst, out of curiosity?
---
I haven't tried any of it yet. are you saying that it doesn't save the selcted stats of legendary equipment when I have it in more than one preset?
---
The main story is absolutely horrible and they are planning to overhaul it at some stage. For now you can enjoy 15hrs of fetchquests with horribly inconvenient teleporter locations. Once you get up to the first expansion there is a big improvement in the content quality. You could also buy a level50 booster and a base game completion from the real money store if you hate the grind but it's a bit of a luxury to do that.
---
At this point I'm not sure if it's even greed. I think its desperation. Anet doesnt have anyone who knows what's good for the game, refuse to playtest and do user acceptance testing so they're just throwing dart blindfolded and see what sticks. They think they know what best for the game without being avid players themselves and when they reveal something and the community shits on it, they deem us all as trolls and ignore it all. You can even see this in their marketing plan where they tried to show how great templates are with "how many clicks itd save you". This was such a pathetic marketing move. Instead of answering the feedback honestly they still have their head in the clouds going "look how awesome we are! We polished a piece of turd!"
---
The right move here is to flat out say we fucked up build templates, were going back to the drawing board to fix it. You start earning the trust of your players back slowly by being real and honest. Instead they're trying to preserve the fragile egos of their devs because they believe they can somehow do no wrong. Newsflash anet, whether or or not you say it, we know you suck, we just want you to stop denying it so you can get on the road to not sucking.

old school runescape
---
Nope, swapping traits on the same build.
---
So I have to now reset my build as far as traits go between game modes?  That is very irritating.  I really only play a few modes per charectar, but my pvp to carebear or carebear to wvw will take a bunch of time on different characters in order to hop from one game mode to the next?  I find this infinitely obnoxious.  I really do not want to do this.  If I have a couple of elelmentalists, will I need to swap templates when I choose one over the other for something differnet?
---
And how's that working out for y'all?
---
Thanks for your experimentation! I guess I shall spam use all my charges and then swap traits then!
---
We already had 1 for PvE, PvP, and WvW before build templates came around.  They saved your utilities and traits.  The only thing we were lacking was equipment templates.
---
I think I lost some brain cells reading that. SMH.
---
From what I remember even if they do have the possibility to add  a bunch I think they said that the way the UI behaves was the bottleneck to adding more for the moment, so maybe they already have some placeholder slots but are limited by how the UI handles it for the moment.
---
As a programmer, I would like to remind you the most recent example of Anet adding stuff and using it later. 3rd garden plot.. This isn't something new. They have been pulling shit like that for years..
---
You know, instead of sucking their playerbase dry by selling piecemeal game mechanics, they could be making a new game. Or an expansion. That's what game companies used to do.
---
If this is what I'm getting for "free" then  I guess I would be better without it. Let the game go into maintenance mode and show what you're capable as a company, because this is cannibalizing your own product for profit. 
---
I never implied they should underpay anyone.
---
As somebody who isn't familiar with revenant enough, what is going on?
---
[Occam' Razor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor) opposes that theory.
---
How is it greed to try and sustain a b2p mmo through convenience purchases? 
---
All these useless comolaint threads are hurting the game at least just as much as the badly implemented template system.
---
Ah but look, then it's different. Because if we're gonna do it fair at that point you'll need to grab the price of the template and not the whole sub. And at that point we'll still end up cheaper. Otherwise we're comparing apples with oranges.
---
Is that the best response you could muster in 5 days? Or did mommy take your internet away? :'(
---
That is something that always puzzled me when I saw people doing very low DPS because like even a DH spamming 1 and 2 on Scepter is around 15-16k DPS iirc and if you go with something like Staff DD you can even more (mostly because it's the most powerful AA of the game).
---
I'm running out of keybinds and they keep adding more mounts. I don't have the addon but an in-game one would be nice.
---
I found only memes and complaints but zero useful information, videos, or screenshots.
---
I'll take a meh DPS over a meh support in a group any time of the day though :p
---
Some good/decent support can carry some meh DPS way more than some of good/decent DPS can carry some meh supports.
---
My number pad is on the right, so is my mouse. I'm not crossing my left hand over and I'm not dropping my mouse to press a key.
---
what is factually false? the boiling frog metaphor? or that companies release unfinished games? either way they are both exactly what is happening here and all over the gaming industry. Maybe you're too young to remember all the outrage over day 1 DLC's from a decade or so ago.
---
contains no gameplay
---
O man playing all the internet cards now. OMEGALUL.
---
People who completed the mastery
---
Thank you!! I was going crazy
---
Im sry, here OMEGALUL.
---
you dont know what youre talking about
---
That’s some direct criticism right there.
---
I do. FF XIV for three months now. And it's to remind others.
---
But master white knight will certainly find a Freudian reason why I'm posting now.
---
The comparison to GW1 templates is a bit limping, I agree. But we also need to keep in mind that Armor in GW1 was not really that wide spread when it comes to status points and different usecases. 
---
I have 6 different domination builds for my Mesmer in GW1. I can play all 6 of them with my domination armor set. Only one needs a different headpiece. But still, 6 builds for 1 set of armor. The same for inspiration and illusions. Then I can actually "recycle" some armor pieces for other builds. For example, I can use pants that have no skill Rune on it on pretty much any build as long as I don't need another stat rune on them. Every character has 4 weapon sets by default. I can switch between my staff, scepter/focus, sword/shield and spear/shield combination anytime I want. So my domination gear, in combination with four weapon slots and the ability to save as many skillbars as possible, already gives me access to more builds than the out of the box free version of GW2's template system. And then there is the fact, that you have a separate Inventory only for Equip. You don't even sacrifice normal inventory space for it like in GW1 because you can't equip anything else in this slot aside from the equip box.
---
Now... Let's look at GW2's system. And to make it easier I will apply the same logic as from my GW1 example and only look at one stat combination. In my case, the condi Mesmer/Mirage. Unlike GW1 I can't just say "I am condi so this is my equip for every condi build out there". If I would like to have (for whatever reason) a core Mesmer condi build, I am already one saveslot down. But I also want to have a Mirage condi build. Second saveslot down. Now I maybe want to have a different weapon combination on one of these two condi builds. (I remind you, I am still using the same Armor but just different weapons). And tadaa, third saveslot down and I need to buy a new one should I think about playing anything else than condi Mesmer.
---
And this is only taking into account that you play ONE stat combination... I didn't even talk about the fact that your current build is also already blocking a saveslot. So as soon as I want to change something or try something out, it will autosave. I want to revert the change? Sure thing, but I need to do it manual again.
---
This system is offensive to the playerbase who actually wants to take part in the "build crafting" aspect of the game. Why should I feel the need to play around with different ideas if that means in return, I will automatically delete one of my pre set loadouts? And if I don't like my idea, I need to build it back again.
---
So you should be, I demand recompense for this oversight.
---
Yup. Afaik when it is one of the listed causes, you usually can't load the game in the first place so you can't have this popup.
---
Even ANet admits they are Loadouts, not templates
---
Hell no. Save all that money and effort on engine development and use a well developed engine like Unreal or Unity.
---
aka more stuff i dont care about.
---
Even when 10 was from begin avaible, the communtiy will rage about that this are not enough. Beside that frrrrom a marketing standpoint it was better to do it in that way, the same from a software Engineering stand.
---
I do T4s regularly (not CMs and not "exp" group) and the biggest tell about how the run will go is having to do Underground Facility. If we don't have to run around 5-10 minutes to kill the last boss the run will be smooth as hell.
---
Now add underwater skills, land skills, ranger pets, rev legends, etc...  build templates are much more than traits.
---
I logged out after I went from PvE to WvW and the build did not change. I tried to change build, but then realized the gear couldn't be linked to a build in any way. Didn't change when I went to PvP even. I just logged out and haven't logged back in since (usually played several hours a day).
---
I resubbed to WoW today. I love GW2 to death, but this may actually be the death of the game for me.
---
I've always kinda shook my head in wonder at people who have such intensely fine tuned min-max builds that they require swapping out bits and pieces of their traits and gear/runes for singular battles or sections.
---
I get that people enjoy min-maxing and that stuff, but does it really change THAT much for "roaming in WvW" vs "Zerging" in WvW? Or the difference of using one specific set of trinkets vs another?
---
For example, what's the difference between the two "support renegade" builds. Why do they need two different armor/trinket sets? Is the difference so intensely noticeable that it's required?
---
It's annoying as fuck I know your problem... How can we explain it so others understand it? Maybe it's just a simple misunderstanding and most players don't understand what exp means...
---
Jokes aside, you're back from work or what ever and you wanna have fun doing content that is more difficult than other stuff. 
---
So you're looking for people who play on the same level and aim for the same goal. Someone gives a fuck and just joins your fun mostly also without answering to questions etc. So people give him a chance and see he's not good enough so he has to leave.
---
Just to let you know situations like this happens regularly in real life. It feels like a lot of players see gw2 as a session of any boardgame or whatever (totally fine, it's your money and free time). Believe it or not there're people out there declaring it as a hobby as well.
---
Imagine a bunch of football players who want to play a game with experienced players, a 2vs2 table tennis match or whatever.
---
If you're not good enough people will look for someone else to replace you.
---
There're will always be the situation where  experienced players would say :"You know what we really wanna finish this game now but we can play later if you want." But you shouldn't expect experienced players to take you with them and help you everytime.
---
Another example of a skiing trip... We were to slow, so faster ones decided to go on there own tour the next days. Same with a climbing trip. It's annoying when people have to wait one hour or more. Later there's time to help you increasing your skills, but don't expect it every time.
---
Another thing I really wanna add. Imagine you really love what you're doing, so you study football or climbing or whatever and get the perfect equipment for it so you can enjoy your hobby. People come to you and say:"Who do you think you are? Don't take this shit to serious. I can't imagine you having fun doing this"
---
Imagine doing the same in gw2, getting the perfect equipment for your goals. Now you're a minmaxer, who can't enjoy the game.
---
Back to the real world. Imagine you wanna go on a climbing trip and people wanna join you on very difficult paths without the proper equipment...what would they say?
---
There's also the possibility to drag you trough all this but you won't learn anything from it. And like I said before, doesn't it sound ridiculous demanding this from others players? 
---
Thanks to everyone who made it to this point
---
Theoretically. What do I know if the window is gone when I port someplace else or the game disconnects or what not. Stranger things have happened.
---
Why cant they seperate from NCsoft ? I feel like they are the ones dragging this game down
---
The thought shouldn't be will this happen but can this happen, and how often with what impact.
---
Probably not much. It only seems to affect the high end players who had large amounts of builds tailored almost exactly for super specific fights or instances, from what I can see.
---
Lost Ark would like to have a word with you
---
I used to play Star Wars: The Old Republic where gameplay relies heavily on having quickbars on your HUD (to access skills and items). Those were monetized from pretty much the launch of the game in 2011. You got two for free and had to pay for the additional four. So this is nothing new. A lot of players paid for them and game developers will keep repeating things that have proven to make them money.
---
this sounds like a nightmare i would have had a panic attack if that happened to me but luckily i do all festival activities on some trash alt
---
&gt; This stuff likely isn't bound to database columns, anyway, everything gets its own row.
---
That's how good design is. Unfortunately, using columns instead of rows is not a rare mistake. My "stupid hypothesis" is that this mistake may have been made here.
---
It actually is compliant. ArenaNet have stated many times that they are fine with Arc and deltaconnected has worked with ArenaNet directly to make sure that is the case.
---
Yeah but now you have 3 "free" ones that don't swap on gsmemode swap so you can queue pvp with a 0 survivability raid build
---
Damn, aggressive much?
---
I joined to follow and watch as I was interested in how the game had become and possibly start playing again...
---
Of course i know that.... -__- you are playing with words. The number of changes was unlimited. Is it better ?
---
no you are salty at ppl who disagree with you but your opinion is very uninformed.
---
Lmao, expecting these people to read.
---
If you don't log in for the duration of the episode you have to pay anyway? Most games do this lol, it's pretty normal.
---
I’m not seeing this achievement at all, and there’s nothing on wiki??
---
Did I just get downvoted for not blaming Anet for their Build Templates or what is this? :D
---
The killed Staff Bunker in a hotfix, that is tollay funny
---
why would 10 be any better from a software standpoint? If anything word size * n  would be the most efficient since it maximizes the data per byte.

---
Server stabilty testing, it is ever to point between testing and live server.
---
Ty for elaborating the obvious. But since he was talking about paying for it in general, i was referring to that. Normalizing paying for every chunk is the part i dont like.
---
Release expansions with new races, new classes, new elite specs.  There is content they could be focusing on that has actual value to it's playerbase that also adds longevity to the game.  QOL improvements being monetised seems like a lazy way to try and get some extra cash.
---
I'd have no issue paying $60 for a new expansion.  If you want to make money, make content that doesn't make your playerbase feel like they're being ripped off.
---
Bind your [Tinfoil Hat] to a equipment template hotkey for faster access
---
Round about 10 euros/month
---
Nah, I dream of them doing what FF14 did. Secretly working on a huge engine and content revamp of the game. 
---
They don't have the funding for it, so it really is just a pipe dream, but it's a nice pipe dream.
---
Ye but they literally advertised the templates with Halloween content the other day, being able to swap builds for lab and ATM. So you'd think they would've considered their Halloween instances. Especially since they released templates during the festival.
---
&gt;Delta literally said it in his developer note that if gw2 ever makes build template official, he would remove it. Wym???
---
Because that's literally the agreement he came to with Chris Cleary. The discussion was talked openly on reddit. 
---
Not sure if dense.
---
"Research" by the way. 
---
First you make uneducated statements about the quality of the official feature then you backtrack and say "just contact support lol"
---
PS. You act and type like a man child. Saying people don't know things doesn't make you win arguments.
---
&gt;"you probs don't even go back that far hahaa gottem"
---
They'd have to make a new engine first right?
---
I know what you're saying but I believe you're wrong. In my personal experience, there is NO excuse that is good enough for a bad job. The problem in my opinion is a uncommitted, demotivated and unfocused staff. And I think it's not their fault either, I think the ones to blame for this are management.
---
Before the GFC hit I was working in a lab for one of my country's biggest cement plants. At the time we had committed ourselves to the development of a HUGE project, a new cement mill worth 8-figures, it was gonna be the biggest the country has ever seen, not only that, the most profitable and the most environmentally friendly. After we finished its construction though, it didn't work... We tried everything and the final conclusion was that it was impossible for us to operate it according to initial projections. The problem was that the only way we could justify its payment was with a few massive contracts our sales team procured prior to and during its construction, so we had no more than 3 months to get it running at at least a minimum efficiency.
---
In the end we got it, we literally tore half of it down, just to rebuild new sections. We consulted with more experts than you could imagine. Our admixtures contractor invented over 30 new admixture prototypes specifically for this. In the end we nailed it perfectly, it's not to say it wasn't impossibly hard, but we got it. And during the GFC that hit immideately after its completion, THIS mill and it's contracts were the only thing keeping the company afloat. The only difference between that mill driving the company into bankruptcy and being their greatest investment was passion.
---
We didn't sit on our asses and make excuses for wasting tens of millions in company assets on a bad product. We justified it by doing the best damn job we could. As scientists we literally went from testing hundreds to thousands of test samples per week... Among 5 of us!
---
There is no GOOD excuse for a BAD job.
---
Better crack open that wallet, boy.
---
Thank you!
---
I only have 1 build for all 9 characters except my main toon who has 2 builds. I have 4,000 hours into the game over 7 years with 5 legendary weapons. The outrage is confusing to me because I never realized people run with 6-10 builds on 9 characters at once. It seems absurd to me. It makes sense that if you want to run *that* many builds at once then your gonna end up paying up lol. 
---
I also know that my opinion is a very unpopular one, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it lol
---
I can't use level 80 boost since last night. I created 2 new accounts, i tried using it on one of them few days ago, but i revert and undo it. Now, i tried last night again but it says *"That content has been temporarily disabled. Please try again later".* The problem still persists now too. Is there anyone facing the same issue?
---
One thing a lot of games have done right recently: Season passes!
---
" Since noone has posted about this yet, the bonuses you get from buy the Extra Life bundle or booster are currently working "
---
is it? because i have both the blue and white titles, but i still havent received any mails or doesnt have the bonus effect active.
---
"  gotta go to LA and "refresh" them. "
---
please extrapolate. talking to a npc? buy another karma booster and use it? what do you mean? simply go to L.A?
---
There are also PvP templates coming....could be that those more slots are reserved for that.
---
What part did he change.. the traits and utilities.. or his gear when this happened?
---
I did fractals yesterday. We quit halfway through 99cm because we kept disconnecting.
---
There are pvp templates coming, it can be that those extra are reserved for it.
---
They call it templates because whole community spells templates through years.
---
At this point GW1 is only playable because Heroes exist though. Without them, you'd need a tight-knit and active community to play the game at this point.  
---
While there definitely was less grouping up when people discovered the popular hero builds (N/Rt spam anyone?) I do distinctly remember still grouping up a lot for Dungeons.  
---
They definitely didn't kill the game's community.
---
you are confusing "dying" with "(effectively) dead". ofc there are still people, but playing certain types of content has become a real struggle unless you are in a healthy static group. see *technically* wvw is still playable with 1-3 players per faction... that wouldn't mean the mode is in a healthy situation or that it can even maintain those numbers.
---
with all the unfortunate events since PoF event the most stubborn people should realize by now that gw2 is bleeding players way faster than it should. sure, there is also a steady stream of new players, but those generally do not stay around for long.
---
and since ANet's catalogue of products isn't all that large, they are inherently damaging their reputation severly with each mishap.
---
gw2 has been crawling towards a point of no return for a long time, and while i'm not interested in speculating whether that point has been crossed or not, it's not even a question that restabilizing the franchise, the game, and even the company behind it would require some really hard work.
---
the only glimmer of hope that currently exists lies in the new balance teams, which make a good impression, but even if those folks deliver on that hope, that alone won't be enough.
---
check previous years graphs if you dont believe me.
---
Timegate, i think
---
Hey if Daybreak Games can slap DX11 into Planetside 2(Previously DX9) , Anet should be able to too.
---
Probably has to do with account crawling cycle of GW2Efficiency. Better ask /u/queicherius.
---
I would not be surprised if they added something similar to build templates model in upcoming "saga".
---
Wouldn't surprised me if that was one of the projects that got canned by NCSoft.
---
&gt; And a large portion of the community
---
evidence for that? probably mostly dedicated raiders/t4 fractal players and a "casual" here and there. thats what? 1-5% of the playerbase?
---
r/gatekeeping me for how much time I have spent on a single hobby? 
---
Go ahead and play 10k hours of guild wars 2 if you wish to do so :D
---
While I believe that this shows a trend, remember that the people who are using efficiency are also the people who are more dedicated in maxing things out.
---
CryEngine, Archeage is one of the smoothest running MMOs I played in awhile or possibly ever (yes i'm on that Unchained hype) when it's not randomly crashing or having loading issues under certain graphical settings which is probably more developer being at fault than anything. + it has nifty physics.
---
That's exactly what I linked to you (did you even look at it?). Summary:
---
2012: Increase during halloween, no increase after, decrease in december.  
---
2013: 200% increase at start of halloween, then gradual decrease. No further increase.  
---
2014: 100% increse at start of halloween, quick decline then slow decline. No further increase.  
---
2015: gradual increase from start of halloween, sudden increase in May, then remaining stable.  
---
2016: huge decrease (19s85 down to 5s37 in 4 days). Remains stable through, and after halloween. No further increase.  
---
2017: sudden subtler price drop at start of halloween - slowly increase, recovering by May.  
---
2018: Spike (5s69 to 7s48) at start of halloween, quick decline, then slow build up. Price doubles by May.   
---
2019: Sudden sharp decline at start of halloween. So far has been consistent, halloween is ongoing. 
---
So in 2015 and 2018, yes at some point ToT bags doubled in price, some months after halloween (in both instances, 6 months). But the chances aren't exactly on your side. Not saying it won't happen, but I am saying it's more likely not going to. You're more likely going to be selling them for their current value, or with a small increase in value, far less than double.
---
Players who completed "mastery" meta-achievement.
---
Shh let them inflate their ego that their view is correct and facts are wrong I call it Trump/Farage syndrome. Anet has been around for 20 years, has made and continues to make NCSoft a lot of money, outside of NCSofts main games Blade and Soul, Lineage 2 and Aion GW2 is their biggest franchise. Yes Anets had problems this year it happens. It seems like a year for it with Blizzard also facing trouble. I have no doubt like with the legendary runes and sigils update build templates will get major fixes in the next couple of patches.
---
Reddit in general loves the term gaslighting
---
I prefer this version! IIRC they said that they only have a limited amount of space that they can use for those templates so having a "duplicate" for each of the game modes then it would at least triple the amount of templates just for PvE, PvP and WvW. Which could overall reduce the number of templates slots you can have.
---
Having it set with a flag on those slots would make more sense.
---
Comparing templates to D3 auction house.... Did u drop /s?
---
It looks fancy thats why.
---
With the recent shit show from Bethesda ( i used to be kind of a fanboy from them) you better lower your expectations for TES6, and just To make things better, they already said they should have found a method to better monetize skirym, so you can almost bet TES6 is going to be a micro transactions shit show, unless they (finally) learn from their mistakes (doubt it)
---
Yeah it was that "legolas feel" i wanted :D
---
The main reason i selected ranger was it should be beginner friendly, but if melee is the way to go, maybe i switch up to guardian for my first endgame char
---
If I were you I wouldn't worry about the weapons you're using until you actually get to endgame. In the open world pretty much every weapon is viable. 
---
The truth about endgame PvE (fractals and raids) is that you're going to be in melee range for the majority of fights even on classes that have ranged options and unfortunately longbow has very little use in PvE. Besides on warrior condi builds longbow isn't used in endgame afaik however if you do want a ranged option viable for endgame on ranger shortbow is the way to go. I haven't played it personally but the condition damage builds for ranger all use shortbow and although condition damage isn't ideal for fractals (and a few raid bosses) you can probably still get by if that's what you really want to play.
---
But like I said I really wouldn't worry about endgame for now. If you do want a good longbow build to use while you level or play open world here's one I found that seems to be pretty popular [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger\_-\_Longbow\_Beastmastery](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery)
---
I don't think you understand the whole point of the post. Games aren't 1v1, they are 10v10. Chances that you 1v9 every game when massive differences arise, are tiny. 
---
Of course in the long run you get to your actual rating, but as I've said, you aren't getting it.
---
As a UX researcher I completely agree with the article. “Is it fun” is the question we get asked the most by developers and it is by far the most pointless question to ask when testing a game. 
---
User experience tests occur during development; there will be bugs and crashes and things that are placeholder and unfinished - it’s not a good predictor of the final product, not in terms of fun at least. And most players will imagine that sure, one day, it could be a fun game.
---
Most people who participate in tests will say it was fun regardless of the actual quality of the game. They came in to playtest a video game that’s in development, that in itself is going to be a lot of fun. People find it very hard to understand where “fun” is coming from when they experience it. For instance in multiplayer tests the “fun score” is always high, even if the game is the most abysmally unfun game you could imagine. Because it’s simply fun to play with other people, regardless of the game. 
---
There’s also a general bias effect in that people will usually skew positive in their scores. A score of 7 (from 1 to 10) is average at best, but most people will assume that’s a decent score.
---
And as the article says, what do you even do with the answer? If it’s fun, okay? If it isn’t, what, you just start again? The question doesn’t help you make sense of things or less to any actionable changes.
---
UX testing is incredibly important, but “is it fun” isn’t as important as “is it understandable”, “is it appropriately challenging”, “is it engaging” and a myriad of other questions that can be answered with confidence through UX and usability tests.
---
Their goal isn't to add something to make it better...
---
I feel the same dude. The amazing thing about templates was always that you can be optimal in every scenario but now with a limit on 6 templates I do not have any slots for my toughness setups on Chrono. I do not have and space to save my different Alac Ren setups, optimized for different bosses and different teamcomps and I can not just save every DH gear variation because I am limited to 6 slots. 
---
And after every raid what I have to do is getting the "templates" back into their original state. I am so disappointed.
---
I've noticed that I've got paired with some PvE players or at least unknown players, these are very unskilled players overall, and if they get to win it's because they usually get hard carried while playing bunky classes. 
---
It's a yikers overall.
---
Ranger is far more forgiving for new players due to the pet tanking, although it might also make it too easy and instill bad habits as the pet becomes less relevant as a tank in late game.
---
And you also don't need to follow any guides for leveling up. Longbow + greatsword is a pretty good newbie friendly combination.
---
Do you have some kind of two-factor authentication on your account?

Comparing one system with another and the will of a company to make a step back, admitting that their actions were wrong and harmful for their game and ultimately stepping in to scrap said system in order to restore their game's issue. I know it's a difficult matter to grasp but try using your brain.
---
Terrible to read. After reading the gear part 3 times I still cant figure out what your problem is lmao

pretty much that

ArenaNet uses a lot of Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) Marketing + Lootboxes to manipulate vulnerable people into buying things. They also manufacture problems so they can try to sell people the solutions.
---
As someone who used to be a whale in this game: it wasn’t because I had tons of expendable income. It was because I have mental health issues that make me *incredibly* predisposed to compulsive gambling, which is what their lootbox system relies on. It also can cause immense anxiety when I feel like I’m going to Miss Out on something which FOMO “only here for three days! For no reason! BUY NOW IDIOT” hinges on.
---
I couldn’t possibly tell you what whales are out there buying character template b/s and why, but as someone who’s taken a lot of time to untangle how this issue affects me (and ultimately has had to quit too many games because it endangers me)... a lot of the time it’s literally out of people’s control. There are entire schools of thought around monetizing games in 2019 whose singular purpose is to prey on people with mental health issues and drain their wallet regardless of if they can’t afford it. It’s vile.
---
If they couldnt make a 100% functional and practical system they either shouldnt make it at all or figure out how to adapt their game so they can have a decent starting point. Instead they half assed it and monetized it the worse possible way.
---
And, did you really just defend their monetization system knowing that theyre trying to sell you few simple strings for 300gems? KEKW
---
And then their friend barges in and says "what, why u no like it, what means other cars on the market can fly, no it's not true flying either, why are you not satisfied with this product, are you a hater?? why you pay no money, mechanics have to eat too, shame on you"
---
NCSoft canned it. GW2 is on life support. :|
---
You don't even think about something when you never had to do it before, and a "QoL improvement" shouldn't make a change that requires you to do it now.
---
&gt; And it's to remind others.
---
because nobody cared that you left
---
" I added the players to my friend list to look at their scores from the previous season "
---
How can you do that?
---
TY for information
---
As someone who literally is targeted by games with cash shops, RNG and predatory monetization: GW2 is *literally* all grinding with the hope you’ll spend money on gems to convert to gold or gems outright because unlocking stuff otherwise is exhausting. The Lootboxes are egregious and I have to actively seek external assistance to avoid gambling despite knowing they’re dogshit because they are by design predatory and addictive. ArenaNet uses anchoring all the time to make things seem like good deals, their entire store relies on FOMO marketing to prey on vulnerable people even though there is 0 technical limitation on how much or how long items can be in their shop.
---
FOMO and peer pressure, lootboxes, rewards kept intentionally low &amp; slow to encourage people to pay to avoid it. I’ve played plenty of games with these practices enough to identify scummy and predatory companies when I see them. Hilariously enough you’re right: ANet isn’t comparable to a mobile game dev. Many mobile games at the very least respect my time. ArenaNet is worse.
---
Revenant has a longbow build for pve with better sustain damage then ranger but it is also boring to play (in general people play this build because you can just auto attack and walk threw the game).
---
If you are interested the youtuber named woodenpotatoes showcased the build.
---
Overwised i played longbow ranger during most of my leveling to 80 and never felt underpowered but once i discovered the sword/axe + greatsword build i never went back to longbow.
---
For big neta events lvl 80 using axe mainhand is also good because the auto attack can hit multiple enemies and then range is decent.
---
For any content that isn't competitive (raids, t4 fractals, pvp and wvw) longbow ranger is still playable.
---
Ahhhh, thanks for mentioning
---
It's not that hard to do. My question would be a "why? why so many times?".
---
I agree with the gw2 points because I am in the same boat for the same reasons, bought it back in 2012 release and have thousands hours on it. I gave up in the game since 2 years ago, it was obvious that it has no future and it's in like... IDK maintenance mode? They don't care they just want more money without giving you a reason to give them more.
---
About AA:U , I didn't stop playing GW2 back in it's drama era too with the bans, then people were teleport hacking all over the place to farm orichal so I won't stop playing AA:U now from their first misstep. Make no mistake, no game is perfect sadly but AA:U feels way more complete as a game, a MMORPG compared to GW2's glorified single player feel.
---
At least I believe I can extract a few hundred of hours from it before I get bored a bit ;p
---
Don't contradict your own statement. The game as a whole is also wvw and pvp. And they don't get anything. So either tell me the value of PvP and WvW is nothing or get out of your ivory tower.
---
the one you cant see because of all the smoke around you while searching in the ruins
---
Welcome to hell
---
Mwahuahuahahahahhaaa!
---
New phone, who dis?
---
They don’t care because their monetization relies on exploiting people- why would this be any different? They exploit vulnerable people already w/ addiction issues and mental illnesses, exploit people who don’t have time to do their dumb grinds to get 2 blues and a green by keeping the game unrewarding enough you’re tempted to buy gems to finish things, etc. . They’re just finally trying to break into the “exploit the more hardcore audience” territory.
---
This is a well known fact, but better realize it late than never. Welcome :)
---
the game has shown us the pods sylvari grow in (you can even visit them in game) the last shot in the sylvari opening cinematic is the sylvari sleeping in such a pod before waking up.
---
also just because the sylvari are plant creatures doesn't mean they were made from other plants. that's completely asinine. 
---
the big diffrence between mordrem and sylvari is that mordrem are "cloned" from beings placed in Mordrem/Blighting Pods using corrupted plant matter (as you've stated) while sylvari are grown inside pods.
---
When Guild Wars 2 first launched I wanted to be very connected and active with and on the official forums. After I posted a handful of times more than half of my posts got edited or deleted. 
---
I've never been censored so much as on there while my posts weren't even negative in any way.
---
gg
---
The whole trait system is a mess anyway, trait lines should have never been a thing, they're a huge headache for balance. Instead, let people select traits freely, and remove all the useless ones. Less is more.
---
You can take this further into core profession design as well. The elementalist is the prime example here, they fucked up horribly by implementing attunements the way they were implemented. Now each weapon has four times the skills, with all the design and balance problems it brings.
---
The core game wasn't designed with elite specializations in mind either, they just planned to release new weapons and skills now and then (never happened, they only released one new healing skill per profession in 3 years, plus the antitoxin spray no one gave a shit about). Instead of strengthening the core professions, they pushed elite specializations in top of them, without fixing any of the problems at the core.
---
I wrote these core profession redesign threads for fun a while ago: [Elementalist](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/22955) - [Mesmer](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/22919) - [Necromancer](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/23149) - [Engineer](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/22222) - [Ranger](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/23597) - [Thief](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/22203) - [Guardian](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/24508) - [Revenant](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/22455) - [Warrior](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/25921). Just in case you're interested in the topic.
---
Well they release "paid" feature, that do not work as intended and "bugged"? Like I am ok with beta testing f2p games...
---
But "they could not tested every possible place". QA should test every instance before it goes life since it is "new" content for build templates. Making build templates disabled by default in every "new" instance before initial testing is safe way to dodge all the reddit drama like this topic.
---
Clearly you havnt spent enough time playing good games then
---
It's not a picture made with a phone about some guy getting a shiny weapon after 40 years of continues 8 hours of play every day.
---
Best QA
---
&gt;Its terrible in PvP and WvW. Your opponents will quickly close the gap and beat you senseless. 
---
You are doing everything wrong if that's the case.
---
This is wrong information, longbow is considered a meta build for rangers in PvP and WvW.
---
Little correction: Revenants use shortbow, not longbow.
---
In an "11 million" player game, that should be among the top 3 mmo games on the market, **4 people** have mastered HoT: Act 4 over the past 8 months. Only people linked to efficiency, but still wtf man
---
Quite frankly, you should play what, and how, you want. Don’t let builds online sway you. Unless you intend on being a min/maxer (which you could be), I would suggest doing what is fun for you. 
---
Even if you ran Longbow/Greatsword than you could still be like Legolas from The Hobbit! He even used bow and sliced Orcs with Orcrist, The Goblin Cleaver after taking it from Thorin! 
---
Good luck, and most importantly, have fun. 👍🏻
---
About a month ago:
---
&gt; My guess would be that the claims of technical difficulties are exaggerated and what is really behind the low number is PR considerations. I know this sounds weird, why would a low number be good PR?
---
&gt; Let me explain:
---
&gt; * As soon as they announce prices, someone will calculate what it costs to unlock everything. If that sum is too big, it will produce ugly headlines. Yes, it is stupid, but people do get riled up by a single big number more than by the actual details of how any given system works.
---
&gt; * Assuming they get over the inevitable initial outrage, increasing the cap later is a relatively easy way to create positive news and additional sales.
---
&gt; * If the outrage is too big before release they can increase the cap in a classic *"See, we listen to your feedback"* move.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcijao/why_im_so_worried_about_the_build_template/f2a44fd/
---
&gt;because spaghetti code
---
Because incompetence and laziness, of which spaghetti code is a symptom.
---
Looks like the ending to some TV series, right at the climax.
---
Except it's the ending of a franchise instead.
---
I know, a silly thought these days.
---
It's weird that I've been a thief main since I started playing, but I couldn't remember a single thief weapon skill if my life depended on it
---
...dagger 3rd auto is lotus strike I think
---
It is but it's daily now and not many do it. The new map in season 4 episode 6 is better and right now the Halloween festival is the best. You can see [some numbers here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh487baFzsbJARil-evNdrG3KOmoncEfurElBm0CzdE/).
---
Like Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 build on core of WoW engine by former Blizzard employees...  
---
It took them 5+ years to upgrade GW1 to GW2.
---
Do not see how this company can deliver new game when they lost all those people three times over the years.
---
The range is 900, which is standard for shortbow. Though, a somewhat common sentiment is that the renegade's shortbow skills feel much more like a longbow.
---
Whatever the opposite of an altoholic is, that's me - my first and only character is a mesmer, now I play mostly as a power chrono, occasionally boon chrono. Still working on mirage condi gear. I purchased double additional crafting licences and am making full use of them (weaponsmith, artificer, tailor, chef). I play plenty of fractals (just did my first CM) and some raids, lots of open world metas and similar PvE. I barely do WvW or PvP and probably never will beyond the odd visit.
---
What do you recommend as a second character? Ideally something that plays very differently. Maybe something that opens up different roles in raids &amp; fractals. Something with a good healing spec perhaps? Any suggestions?
---
Hello darkness my old friend...
---
it's possible some genuinely dislike it. shocking i know huh😮
---
i closed it when i heard her say "shatows" that kind of over annunciation is awful
---
&gt; At this point I'm not sure if it's even greed. I think its desperation. 
---
Neither. It's incompetence.
---
If they wanted to make money, they could release:
---
* Swimsuits.
---
* Polymock with gem store booster packs.
---
* Combat tonics of legendary characters and unplayable races with custom voices.
---
And that's just off the top of my head.
---
https://youtu.be/2GgGTsxqWWM
---
They hired aggressively for mobile development and nothing came out of it. Either it was "Guild Wars Immortal" and NCSoft dodged the bullet here, or maybe it was something GW related like "Guild Wars Polymock" and NCSoft pulled it since scene is domninated by Hearthstone and MTG Arena and nobody can really cut into the market.
---
Why do you even pvp in gw2? They dont want you in there!! Pvp in this game is so dead at this point that you must be necrofilic!
---
&gt; But GW2 is still a great game with a lot of potential 
---
Some people have been saying this for 7 years, it's gotta stop at some point. Apparently that point is when ArenaNet fails us for the umpteenth time.
---
Yeah ok i didn't play shirtbow much but it feels smooth to play anyways wich is what i wanted to say :) thx for the precision thow. Also the animations are kinda nice for a bow weapon and rev also has interesting builds for endgame group content.
---
There are still people passionate about the game. Even here. We have these blow ups all the time, it's been going of for years. And yet we still get a lot of new players coming in. You're overestimating the importance. Sure some people will be put off, but probably less than you think. People often expect reddits and forums to be negative.
---
Raids, not dungeon.
---
This subreddit has always been full of fanboys, white knights, and (potentially paid) shills, who do nothing else than to shove the garbage under the rug, again and again, until it explodes.
---
 You just forgot to switch the build template! :-D
---
titles are rarely chosen by the writer, blame the site's editorial team.
---
which doesn't seem to have anything to do with Anet, btw.
---
original content does not necessarily mean quality content
---
Those damn trolls, not playing our game!
---
&gt;it was definitely a hack. Not something any company (or developer) would want to support. 
---
Can you explain further? If it works, and doesn't cause issues (which apparently it didn't), why would a company not use it? What are the problems?
---
Exactly, whatever information you get out of GW2Efficiency will always be on the positive spectrum of the game.
---
Do you play inventory or bank slots? Do you need inventory slots or bank slots today? Do you want to play several builds that you were able to play 2 weeks ago?
---
All their big talent already left.
---
Yeah it sucks, but really the only alternative for now.
---
You should have taken the "most completed achievement" of each category as well, to understand how many people didn't potentially even play the episode in the first place (more than you suspect).
---
"Don't you have jobs?"
---
this is a bit naive from the community... arenanet did always things like this , after 7+ years now is full of pikachu face....
---
If it were about enjoying the tiny details one would relish the opportunity to finely tune traits on demand. This is about comfort and convenience and staying in the same end game rut.
---
The whole problem of this is that 90% of people will jsut use their ingame gold to buy whatever slots they need. Heck, you actually even just need inventory tabs, as you can freely use unlimited chat links for builds. 
---
Then, you are at 180 gold per inventory tab.
---
Compare it to 32slot bags that cost around 150 gold to craft, and 150 gold to get additional slot. Compare it to all the skins and infusions that people pay hundreds or thousands of gold and it gives them no play value. 
---
The prices would be way more acceptable if there would be no gold to gems conversion, but then you would have to pay for all of that without any options. That would suck way more for most of players.
---
&gt;In placements you get mixed with players from 1800 to 1200.
---
I'm pretty sure that placement games and "normal" ranked games are the same.
---
The only thing is that when you're in placement you have a "virtual" placement rating that is more volatile.
---
But during your placement if for example, during your third game, your virtual rating is 1400, you will be placed in a "normal" 1400 rating game, with typical 1400 rating players.
---
&gt;It's the same as playing in high ratings during the morning
---
Which is a good time to play high rating games, it makes it easier to climb.
---
Screenshots can easily be faked.
---
cool
---
opinions + criticism = brat 
---
noted
---
It's pretty much like...
---
"Do you spend at least 100€ every month buying gems for GW2? No? Then Anet doesn't care about you."
---
They only care about whales that bring them the most income, so semi-hardcore players like me and you, and many of those who buy gems with ingame gold, might as well not exist to Anet.
---
Start doing fractal CMs. It will be hard to begin, due to a lack of experience, KP requirements etc, but it's worth it. You will have higher daily gold income and super fast T4 runs. Sometimes CMs+T4 only take ~30-40min. Everything just melts.
---
They killed my fun by destroying my Chrono in the last year, and it's not only my spec the one that was destroyed.
---
We even thought is was because we were approaching new elite specs but it's not even that: no, they are just that incompetent and disconnected with the actual game.
---
7k hours in, I am starting to feel a schadenfreude feeling with ArenaNet's fails.
---
&gt; Combat tonics of legendary characters and unplayable races with custom voices.
---
It would be not complete without Catgirl race. Nobody wants Tengu nonsense....
---
When did I say all of it was instanced? i only compared pvp, specifically how poorly gw2 performs with even 3-4 players on the screen while in a mode that is instanced (since you comparing instanced vs non instanced).
---
I just mean that there is no evidence to say that unreal is so bad when we have examples of it perform so much better than gw2’s unique engine
---
I seem to remember the first 3-6 months after release the entire game staff wouldn't even provide a tweet about the state of the game. It seemed like they completely evaporated. Good to see they figured out how to handle that aspect of game development.
---
&gt; Since characters don't have universal access to their bank, then moving legendary gear from character to character will probably never be a thing as the system would have to be programmed to actively remove the gear from another character, move it to the bank, pull it out of the bank into the current character's inventory, then into the template.  
---
This is not necessarily correct.  If they were to cannibalize the bank code, the basic functionality would be that the gear is stored inside this bank, thrown onto the character as the template is activated and removed from the character and put back into the bank when the template is changed or the character logs out.  
---
This special bank/template gear would be absolutely limited to account bound gear only.  
---
They could even keep the current front-side implementation of gear templates because soulbound gear would function as a base set.  
---
The account wide gear template system would potentially use code based on whatever makes the bank account-wide, but it would not be the bank and thus you do not need a permanent bank access.  It would be a separate system.  
---
The fact that a fancy enough bot can do the above by mimicking a set of human-defined motions in a formatted inventory/bank space says that it's possible to make a system to "brute force" exactly what you're saying.  The devs, having access to more of the back end, should be able to facilitate that much functionality at a bare minimum.  
---
The logout check is as simple as having the logout options send a command to store the template, a timeout for d/c's, and a catch-all that if another character is detected as logging in without the other logged out, the template is unavailable until you log in the proper character or the timeout on it activates (And I'm sure there are better ways of doing this).  
---
With programming, if a monkey with a keyboard and mouse can do it once, then you can program it to happen over and over, more precisely and faster.  All the base systems needed are already in the game in one form or another, and were even before this mess they've gone and made...  This system should have been a whole lot better than it is because a fancy bot can still do it better, more reliably and it would not be causing system crashes, loss of items and other such all over the place.  
---
Again, if a fancy bot was already doing it better then they were in the wrong to release this thing in this state.
---
They'll (literally) reinvent the wheel.
---
This is manly because it is a team mode. When u get some bad team mates it can u push down, even as the best player. The only way to reduce the factor of this 'randomness' is by learing how u can carry. It would be better when the game has more player. That would lead to more fair matched games. What still not mean u dont get some bad player from time to time. 
---
Its fairly said hard to make a good ranking on a team game, even LoL has there some major problems.
---
You can get the Shovels through drops of mordrem mobs and events. They can also be in the Map Bonus Rewards. They are RNG so they are not something you definitely.
---
So farming Silverwastes will probably be the way to farm shovels by doing a lot of events and killing a lot of things, especially champs and elites.
---
You could also do the living world season 2 episode Hidden Arcana which will give you shovel as well.
---
I heard they fired all the good devs of that game and only kept on (shudders) Wrel.....fucking Wrel.
---
People do them, yes. They are not as popular as they used to be but still done. 
---
People are especially doing Ascalonian Catacombs now because of a new achievement collection for a festival skin 
---
So try making a newbie friendly party in lfg or joining one.
---
I didnt say that their dev interaction over there couldnt use some improvement too, far from it.
---
Doesnt change the fact that any attempts of dev communication have been attempted over there. They they stopped Dev AMA's on reddit, they tried to do them in several formats on the forums (Patch day Celebrations, Forum Chats), now hey just started with some kind of ongoing communication/discussion about class balance and skill splits in each game mode.
---
Questions for their livestreams are also collected there because here they just get trolled.
---
So leveling increases your stats by a ton? I swear every time I'm trying to combat enemies at or under my level it's always a cakewalk but as soon as I try to combat an enemy just 1 level above me and it feels like I need to invest 5x the effort just to stay alive.
---
Templates came out with nightfall not eye of the north.
---
Per paragraph:
---
1. Sure, but that doesn't alter how they're formed in those pods. Mordrem are also formed inside pods yet we're told they're made from corrupted fauna.
---
2. How is it completely asinine when mordrem are formed exactly that way and sylvari are basically Mordrem? On top of that, both mordrem and sylvari are explicitly stated to be made in the same "shape" (made of compressed vines, leaves, and bark around a wooden skeletal frame)?
---
3. Sylvari are made from an abstract image of humans (and dogs for sylvan hounds), while mordrem are made from either an abstract image (e.g., teragriffs) or a concrete image of various races. Both are grown in pods.
---
Don’t be the guy who stands in the back where I will get no support, no boons. No boons means way less dmg from u. Don’t be the guy who knockbacks mobs out of aoe. Don’t be the silly ranger who contributes nothing apart fulfilling his own pew pew fantasy. How this games boons and buffs work is proximity based. Meaning stacking in melee range is 95% of the time the best way to do dmg
---
Just think, the very people who created this latrine fire have left Anet (and us) to drown in it and run off to their safe space to make another!
---
One of the primary complaints is there's a 3rd party tool that gave more functionality for free than what build templates give. Now, the 3rd party tool can no longer provide that functionality. Build templates are not only a **downgrade** for those players, they're being asked to pay for that downgrade.
---
That's one of the main complaints, but of course there are more.
---
''You guys are bad, do more dps''  - The guy in T4 fractal doing 7K/dps with 0 potions / 0 utility/food meanwhile the DH does 16K dps and keep calm.
---
&gt; That would suck way more for most of players.
---
Well, no, not really. PoE does this, GGG sells stash tabs and cosmetics only on very high prices and their revenue is good enough for them to stick with this system. Anet however goes into dangerous territory where they introduce a problem (i.e. gear swapping being inefficient) to sell the solution (i.e. an equipment loadout). 
---
If ANet would want to be fair, they'd just sell supporter packs that would give u exclusive cosmetic items (like some character auras, weapon effects, gizmos, mount skils, glider skins, title etc) + some gems. This way u send a clear message: 'buy this to support us and the game'. 
---
Instead they do this weird mobile-like-game-thing that they try to bait you into thinking the game is 100% free and there's no need to buy anything where in reality it just sux to have 5 bag slots, 2 bank tabs and like 4 or 5 character slots. And you could argue that having restricted stash tabs in PoE sux too but their price is (relatively to everything else in their store) pretty low and wont exceed the price of (i.e.) GW2 expension pack (and PoE is actually 100% free).
---
I agree with this, sadly the game does a horrible job on teaching players how to improve. Which leads to them failing harder content and stepping away from things like raids and Fotm CMs, which then leads to a huge separation in the community a.k.a. elitists vs casuals.
---
I trully believe that fixing that would be the best thing to happen in this game right now.
---
There seems to be a major increase in the gaming world of players speaking their mind about changes.  I think the cultural conciousness has collectively decided too many decisions have been made favoring money over quantity.  Personally, I welcome this change, and hope something comes from it.
---
it really isn’t. open world pve players are incredibly toxic to anyone who doesn’t like the same exact content as them.
---
Henchmen were fine. HEROES were bullshit.
---
Henchmen were an inferior stand-in for your average PUG player that you could just about get by with, albeit sometimes with a little pain. Heroes with a decent build just plain outclassed them.
---
Actually we dont have examples of that. And I don't know which game you are playing, but GW2 performs just fine on my end. I have never played a MMO that managed to keep 60 FPS at all times even in smaller groups in all my 13 years of playing MMOs
---
Thanks. I did go through my inventory but there's just one infusion left out of all I had. 
---
I did submit a ticket to recover my items but decided to post about this so that maybe someone could avoid this. Mine were at least "just" WvW infusions and not some Chak Egg sacs or whatnot :p
---
Thanks, it's kind of a relief to know I'm not the only one who has had this happen \^\^'
---
Just do it. The game changed much with the expansions. (In good way for pve, in bad way for wvw), the problems reported this week are just about one new feature (build templates).
---
The game itself still is worth to play
---
Thanks! I'll go read some
---
Most of the "hard" achievements of previous story chapters can be cheesed by simply bringing 1-2 extra people. No skill needed.
---
Also; PoF act 3 arguably has only skill based achievements and no major grinds, yet its one of the lowest on this scale, even lower than HoT act 4.
---
Curious about a more optimized build for this too. I’m not the best theory crafter but my lazy experiments lead me to two challenges: the longbow just does too little damage. The Shortbow has hilariously short range, like you are nearly in melee range, so there is less defensive benefit.
---
No, I think you misunderstand. I have nothing against people who play those other content types, so long as they aren't constantly complaining about how those content types aren't good enough and more developer resources need to be spent on them.
---
You have a right to express your opinion and I respect that. Take your downvote. I'll give you extreme analogy. You are being violated and instead of fighting back you suggest to just enjoy it and tell others how it feels good.
---
Why would they?
---
Its quite possible that the average completion rate for mastery achievements didnt drop like that. It obviously would be far lower to begin with.
---
But this statistic tells you absolutely nothing about the game as a whole. You know the numbers are probably lower, but thats it.
---
* Bonus rewards from events.
---
* Map bonus rewards, also from events.
---
* Rare drop from enemies.
---
So tag as many events as you can, and stick around for events that spawn a lot of enemies that drop loot.
---
For example, the enemies in the Vinewrath meta do not drop loot, but the ones from bull escorts and forst defense/retaking do.
---
Migraine is annoying, as is the bug that you can get stuck when respawning in the instance.
---
Everybody with enough motivation to do migraine most likely did it a long time ago.
---
The maps tend to be spread around all over the place and more often than not have not been connected to any other map.  It's partially because they're building stuff all over the place but that's also partially driven by the business model of living story which makes it so you could potentially miss episodes.  
---
Living story could have potentially replaced expansions by doing the things expansions have done:  Forming a set of maps that are fully connected by story, theme and zone portals.  LS3 and 4 were absolutely all over the place in both story and map locations, Icebrood looks to be attempting to go back to the paradigm that LS2 did fairly well overall, even if people weren't as excited by the story itself.
---
We called it templates because:
---
1) it was templates in gw1
---
2) it was arcdps templates
---
3) we wanted templates ( not loadouts)
---
It is a great rendition, but damn I’m so burnt out with another cover of this song for 7+ years.
---
Why do that when they can charge you for this?
---
They're not even templates.
---
They are better than nothing, but they are way worse than they could be.
---
You're not alone. It's so disheartening that, with every single update, this sub becomes an absolute trash pit of entitled bitching. I used to come on here after big releases to get caught up and see what people are discovering, but now it's just endless negativity. Honestly, nobody should be surprised that ANet doesn't pay much attention to this miserable shitheap. This sub will rip them apart no matter what they do, so why bother trying to appease them?
---
The meta achievement?
---
nop
---
I was wondering who kept notifying me on Discord. It took me a while to figure out the Discord sound notifications came from your video, lol.
---
I really really want to know how many have invested into this system via gold and money. 
---
I guess eventually we will see the unlocks on gw2efficiency?
---
Almost anything will work on openworld so just play what feel fun for you. Longbow with shortbow weapon switch would probably work fine. Then you can just switch to a "meta" build once you start doing fractals or raids.
---
Another option for ranged-only is Warrior with Longbow and Rifle, You wont have your pet to tank for you but you'd be decently tanking with heavy armour and high base hp anyways.
---
Yes, you can, the same way you can ride a bike without pedals, or eat ice cream with your hands.
---
Also, remember than "ranger" is not "hunter" and the name does not come from "ranged damage" but from "someone who *ranges* over an area, protecting it".
---
The coolest and most famous rangers in fiction are all melee fighters. For example:
---
* Drizzt D'Urden and his two swords.
---
* Minsc favors 2h melee weapons and dual wield maces.
---
* Aragon's sword was called Andúril, but his bow was unimportant.  
---
* The staff thingies Babylon 5 rangers had. 
---
* Even Walker, Texas Ranger prefers roundhouse kicks over shooting.
---
I wonder what would cost more: Develope GW3 or re-launch GW2 with upgraded coding and engine.
---
You will quickly discover that's just how this sub is. There are some nice people here, who are utterly overshadowed by droves of miserable and honestly sad people, who love nothing more than bandwagoning to shit all over the most recent release.
---
Are you playing with big health bars? If not you should give it a try.
---
i am relativ new to the game so i did not knew all of this before. The only other mmo experience was WoW, there you should stay in the back to avoid damage
---
This is a list of demands, not criticism.
---
This, i'm not even going to try to read it.
---
Yup, I know, but what I meant was that before this update, when entering PvP or WvW, the game would use your last used build, i.e passively change it; now you need to **actively** change your build, either by pressing the hotkeys you've configurated or by clicking through the menus.
---
I hate that ... this game is awesome. I know this money shit sucks, but that is happening in most games nowadays. I thing gw2 is still "cheap" in comparison with other games because u can play for your gems.
---
I dont get why u get downvoted, maybe this build isnt "meta" but it is rly good for ppl who want to try spvp and have no previous experience, seems fun too! Good job!
---
Pretty sure he can merge a few and may actually have some identical builds. I have seen a few players in my Guild with 20+ templates but most of them just had a single trait/weapon/utility skill changed.
---
Those changes don't count as a new build.
---
You really like that JP, huh? Haha... very nice!
---
A longbow bear build for every longbow skin in the game and then that for all the different bears too.
---
The differrenc when arc destroy something, u will it not get it back, with offical build templates we have it.
---
It totally looks like a menu you'd get from a console game so I can totally see how it would benefit a controller. I wish Anet had native controller support sometimes.
---
&gt; Sure some people will be put off, but probably less than you think.
---
I am fearing for the future of any game not willing to retain their long time players.
---
You get dishonor if you leave a match in anyway, there is nothing you can do about. The game can not distinguish between a player crashing because of a bug or intentionally to leave the match.
---
&gt; This game is thriving
---
Using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
Totally agree.
---
I was actually expecting to have 3 slots PER game mode ...
---
OP is picking up the slack - don't worry.
---
You must know arc destroyed items from experience...do tell.
---
&gt; Whether that's because of difficulty or time
---
I'm going to lay odds on the achievements becoming increasingly:  
---
•Obnoxious (do a five minute fight without getting hit by [X]) with no retry mechanic  
---
•Grind-abusive, like collect [three-digit number] of mcguffins  
---
•Time-locked, wait two hours for the event cycle and/or only available once per day  
---
Very little thought seems to go into the expected time investment per achievement, and it makes achievement-hunting a bore.
---
Just let us define which template will be used in each game mode by default. Simple as that.
---
Wow, topic is 13hrs old and no:
---
"Hard to get disconnected when you're not logged in :sunglasses: "
---
I am disappoint
---
&gt; when arc destroy something
---
Arc never destroyed anything nor it could. All it did was move the stuff from inventory and equiping it the same way you would manually. The warning message on the main page was put up just for the sake of it.
---
My guess is that they tested up to 10, but it didn't pass testing for some reason.
---
I still participate in guild missions in my WvW guild but I'm only joining WvW when friends ask me to. Let's see what heppens in a few months but right now I'm quite busy in real life anyway.
---
Yet the reddit communities of other games like Warframe, Path of Exile, League of Legends, and Final Fantasy have much more positive posts... With frequent developer interaction, answering questions or even commenting on silly memes.
---
Why do you think that is...? Do you think GW2 just inherently/randomly attracts more negative users to come join its reddit? You can't possibly be that naive.
---
The fact that other games' subreddits are thriving with general positivity, and GW2 is the apparent anomaly, why put zero blame on the game itself? It's the common denominator.
---
If the game released better content, with more polish, less bugs, at a more frequent pace... And didn't ignore large parts of its game like WvW/PvP/Instanced-Content, all things it was heavily advertised for having... Then **perhaps** there wouldn't be as much negativity...? 
---
Common sense right?
---
I'm kinda confused by the *living world* stuff. Are these all unlocked if you have all the expansions upon reaching level 80 or are they only purchasable through the gem store?
---
Lol, see you in 2027
---
Me and my Charr roleplaying fwiends baked mwuffins to send the devs' some luv :3 uWu, thnx for dis purrfect (xD) xperience Anet \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ (also pls mek moar collectible cats rawr \~\^\_\^\~\~\~\~)
---
And the unlocks are obtained from RNG lootboxes :-)
---
How does the numbers for completed S2 mastery achievements *reduce* over time?
---
Pretty sure talazia meant spatially disconnected not network disconnects.  The maps are all over the place, not a unified area.
---
Ok we can forgive you as long as you stick to open world and living world, none of that fractal or raid stuff. Oh and buy our templates and maybe we won't delete more of your stuff &gt;:(
---
Get a LOT better.
---
Dragonfall is currently the best non-lab farm in the game. Lws4 ep6 map, lands around 30 gold per hour, and its much more fun than Istan.

Man, you really are one clever guy. You must feel really enlightened finding the one easiest point I make to rebuttal and finish with a witty comment. Even OP responded with an incredibly well thought out explanation why he's mad below, and you didn't want to respond because you couldn't find a funny enough comeback. You aren't "woke", dude, no matter how much you'd like to be.
---
You have given me a new goal for next Halloween.
---
I feel like it's more on the line where people are not impacted by the change. I for one can see the issue with the templates, but it does not impact me and my gameplay in ANY way. Actually it was a nice and free addition.
---
Because its fun for some. I've always found it a fun challenge to get a "perfect run" or neber failing.
---
Ranger also has the best downed 3 skill that can Rez you against tougher enemies even so is more forgivable in that aspect
---
Condition Ranger (Shortbow) is very good in Fractals, at least for bosses. The trash mobs is where you really want power dps, though Ranger can burst conditions a bit. It's even range-agnostic, meaning the ranger can stack with the group or dance around the outside as needed/wanted.
---
As for Power Ranger (Longbow), it's good for Open World and Story... Until you get Soulbeast. Then you might get away with it in low-level casual Fractals. Still an awesome build I use every day, though!
---
Do you even read a comment when you reply? I was talking about 80/90+ fps which gw 2 cant get past

Regular "The Extra Life" on the left, blue title (for contributors) on the right. The player names have different colors because the one on the left is my character.
---
Since the achievement came out, at that. Who knows how many before then too.
---
Condi shortbow can be very good, sacrifice some range but still have the "ranger" playstyle.
---
This will be my 1st season playing Ranked, but did about 120 unranked matches last season, so I'm not brand new to the game mode, and at least understand the maps, the concept of rotating (though still a struggle), etc.
---
And yet of the 3 placement matches I've one so far:
---
501 - 295
---
151 - 501
---
502 - 127
---
Hard to imagine that "I" am the reason why my team dominated / got slaughtered, so why is that then used to determine "my" skill level?
---
I just find the idea of solo queue so odd for a team focuses 5v5 PvP  game mode.  Sure in a Death Match mode maybe that works, but when strategy, team comp and cooperation matter.....
---
This is why I play 1-2 matches per day.  The game mode is sort of fun, but I'm playing more for daily completionist, rewards, APs, and for something new to do.  That to me is all this game mode is worth.
---
For consistent fun I'll zone into PvE or WvW, where even in group play when your team is composed of random players, it doesn't matter.
---
For those who see PvP as their main/sole preferred game mode, you have my sympathies.
---
Save template to bank / notepad
---
Load template, change whatever.
---
Load template
---
???
---
Profit?
---
You can totally do what you say you can't, it's not the games fault you havent spent 5 minutes figuring how templates work.
---
When it was released I swear I was looking for option for linking build to gear for good 15 minutes before I realised it was not there..
---
Okay.
---
I am in the exact same boat and this will probably be my last post. I just want to forget this company ever existed.
---
I play since BWE's and I always ignored the laughter I got from others playing FFXIV because I love GW1 and had a great time in GW2.
---
But the build templates spectacle and the continued dissapointments finally woke me up as well. The company is full of sh!t. I am sorry. I went from fanboy to really hating them.
---
I said goodbye to my raid static and just left. I do not want to see anything from ArenaNet ever again. I feel punched in the gutter and ignored. Build Templates were supposed to be part of the game from the start, we asked for it 7 years and they only started it on when they saw how they could monetize it. Also if I remember correctly they wrote somewhere that they started last year and it should have been happening a long time ago and on the live stream they said they started working on it this year in April or May.
---
The game will die. It's not a question anymore. There will be episodes going further that people hype up as usual and play through in 3 hours and then its content drought again as it has been for the past years. There is nothing that you can do in the end game. MMOs also live when they have  a prober dungeon LFG and GW2 LFG has never been touched and it gets so fucking shitty to play casually even. Actually, using the LFG casually has never been fun and convinient.       I think about FFXIV duty finder and  I just want to log in there and click a button to play a dungeon.
---
I was at my brother lately who I havent seen in a while and he asked if GW2 was worth it and I  said no. Don't bother.
---
I can't hype this up anymore. It's just betraying the fanbase and catering to the whales over and over again. The product quality outside of story episodes is just frustrating and not worth anyones time.
---
I am amazed to see dumber people every day. You think people who point out extremly bad designs are not nice?
---
Well... yeah, it is. It's certainly not irrational, at least. I think a good compromise would have been to release build slots for free, and then to charge perhaps 800-1000 gems each for *account-wide* equipment tabs. Would it have been perfect? No. It would still also be *worse* than ArcDPS was, but I think a lot more players could have accepted it. As it is they chose to triple monetise the feature in the worst way possible.
---
These motherfuckers.
---
I played in WvW about 4.5 hours ago, no issue, though I wasn't there for long as it was pretty sparse.  Probably many players had logged off for the night lol.
---
As someone who hasn't touched Bound by Blood yet (but plans to do so soon), are the achievements really that bad again? I found some of the War Eternal ones atrocious, especially killing 1000 jungle mobs etc and completing the Meta 25 times. I think I might quit being a compulsive completionist if this goes on...
---
2000 gems per familiar.
---
&gt;I don't get it...
---
That's the whole point. Ppl, that don't need them (Open World casuals/New players) are totaly happy and can't undestand the complains.
---
Ppl that would like to use them (Raiders/WvWers/Min-Maxers) can't use them as intended.
---
/u/TheMrMadzen Same question here, where did you see this *Extra Life Community Goal* achievement, it doesn't show in game for me. I bought the Karma booster, but not the bundle if that matters.
---
https://i.imgur.com/NQiO10E.png
---
bruh go back to KiA
---
Not a dev so you can always correct but i dont think its a natter of if smth can be done, moreso its a matter of how much manpower/time and effort/resources it will take them.
---
Like we've heard claims from ex bioware devs trashing frostbite because it was bad for what they wanted to do and trivial tasks took them longer than they would've liked.
---
Besides i think we've been hearing for like 1 ans a half years now swish tourneys being on the ui part of development and the devs have said that ui is tricky.
---
This was my initial concern, but then I found out you can hotkey your builds, so you just set up two hotkeys next to each other (one for equipment, one for skills) then tap tap and you're done. It'd be nice to be able to tie them together, but it's really not too bad as it is.
---
no, just because sylvari/mordrem flesh is vine-like doesn't mean they're made from vines, that's like saying every human is carved out of a monkey because we're both made of flesh. (also their flesh isn't made from vines, it's bark) there's a big difference between turning materials into living things and corrupted plant matter. mordremoth's relationship with other non-mordrem plants is parasitic while the pale tree is at the very least Commensalistic (but probably mutualistic because the sylvari care for other flora) and part of purifying dragon minions is removing the dragon's corruption from them. these 2 facts alone should be enough to proove that sylvari and mordrem production isn't the same.
---
overall nothing points towards sylvari being made from harvested plant matter or whatever it is
---
I agree with most of this, but come on man, give them some props for HOT level design and the Mounts. No other mmo comes close on either count. In spite of everything else, they still knocked it out of the park on both counts.
---
This pretty much sums up my disappointment right here. Way too expensive.
---
Seeing all these posts really bums me out since I just recently returned to the game for the first time since shortly after the release of HoT. I’m enjoying myself still, but it’s off putting to know that predatory micro transactions and additions that players don’t want have become more prevalent since I left.
---
I hope this stream of negative comments from players can get Anet and their cash hungry overlords at NCSoft to chill out a bit before it drives players away.
---
You should be making many changes to gear except the odd weapon?
---
You know what, you are right the templates suck.
---
You should uninstall this PoS Game and never look back.
---
And every episode is really the same, exact tasks, in a new map.
---
I had to accept the Extra Life Karma Booster from the mail first, the achievements popped up once I had it in my inventory
---
How is that my fault that ANet doesnt deliver any meaningful content i would pay money for? Its their job to give me a reason to spent my money on something they made.
---
A few 5€ skins every 2 weeks or so is no content for me, maybe for others, but not for me. If they want my money they have to make content.
---
I dont want free content i want content thats worth to invest money into, like an expansion. Im just not the target audience anymore and they have to deal with it.
---
So? You think it would with Unreal or what?
---
[Maclaine's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilN1fylw3zY) was the only one that stood out and was awesome.
---
Yeah I just zoned into LA and I got it.
---
I suggest you look at the 2007scape subreddit for a while, a lot of complaining goes on about the game in that sub, but the game is all the better and healthier for it.
---
In my opinion, I don't want to see character commisions every single day, I'd much rather have people complaining about the game to get Anet off their asses.
---
Guy asks if longbow ranger is a viable solo open world build.
---
Idiot redditors say no because buffs and fractals and PVP/WvW.
---
Yes bro you can totally use longbow, it works just fine. People here are just... Toxic and dumb.
---
Changes which you often do if you raid but way to reply when proven wrong.
---
I have the radial bound to the my middle mouse button's left press. Makes it ridiculously quick for me. Much quicker than having to take my hand off my mouse or stop moving to tap with my left hand.
---
My account was suddenly locked behind Otp. I was not able to enter my account, so I submitted anonymous ticket and it was removed by support....it took them almost a week to respond, but they did it eventually.
---
Why did you delete the thread?
---
I went to LA like 45 min before the daily reset and it popped. Bought the bundle though, but should still pop for you.
---
I believe they anticipate reinstating this feature.
---
I mean, they did change who was in charge of WvW / pvp balance. I bet you there is some people that want to have change and some people in leadership position that don't care and want to keep the status-quo in order to keep their position safe...
---
+1
---
But can't do it without farming some karma off of it, can you?
---
Well... in this attempt they got whole 0 from me. I wont be power using the feature, it's mostly ok for me (im just not playing for a week since fear of eating my infusions or duping them is stronger), but if it would be account wide I would totally drop some dough during chistmas sale.
---
Thanks for the distraction from the (albeit justified) build "templates" discussion.
---
Because anet had an agreement with Delta that he had to stop updating his templates when anet would release theirs. 
---
So it's the anet template or nothing basically.
---
Because arc_templates were *banned* and aren't available at the moment.
---
tbh low effort post will cost him karma
---
Ah, I misread that. No, did not play 11.
---
Fb in raids is not responsible for might, in fractal you'd likely run the staff trait for an additional 120 concentration and 120 more when wielding a staff, fractal potions already give at least 15% boon duration. If you want your build to be mildly optimized, you'd not run the same gear.
---
QB usually runs perfect inscriptions which isn't much of an issue if retal is maintained, there would be no need for a separate template. In any case, we are exceeding the limit of 6 gear loadout, which was your point. ^^
---
I wont moss him either
---
&gt; The playerbase is dumb enough *to actually demand to be able to pay for, and then* swallow all their bullshit and defend them.
---
Is karma important to you?
---
Since when is Ogden a Norn?
---
But if these "veterans" have been playing for so long they should remember that near every major update has been shit till the devs make fixes to it later. I mean yeah be angry but the abuse and nihilism I'm seeing is mental.
---
In a few months time this stuff will be refined
---
Will admit The 3x monetization is pretty bad and I'm not too sure that will change which kind of sucks but it is what it is for a f2p
---
Not completely, I have all my alts on there, most of which are Core game only.
---
two hours later…. reinstall &gt; change status to invisible
---
&gt;It becomes "convoluted and broken" when you squeeze it into the originally convoluted edgecases 
---
So it's only "convoluted and broken" for the exact type of players that might want to get more than a measly 3 slots? Excellent argumentation there buddy, you should apply for a job at Anet, seems like you'd fit right into the culture.
---
Serious answer: Karma? No. Upvotes/downvotes? Yes. Getting downvoted shows people don't care for what you have to say, which sucks to hear. Upvoting, obviously, is the opposite.
---
Less serious answer: this is just a pun, as karma is both the unit of upvotes/downvotes for Reddit, and is also a resource in GW2.
---
I know they could do that, but I imagine enough people have bought templates at this point that it would require automating the refunds.  I don't think Anet would be ecstatic about automating the returning of gems.
---
I guess all we can do is wait and watch. But I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
Yet some how I can't even pay anet to get the basic functionality gw1 had.
---
So Edgy.
---
Because ArenaNet fucked up, and ArenaNet fucks up often. Their communication with players has always been notoriously bad in part because they're ridiculously out of touch with the playerbase.
---
Ogden is not a Norn. The racist who says "By Ogden's hammer!" is a Norn.
---
Im guilty also. Im so far behind on episodes Id be playing on dead maps. Motivation is a hard thing to regain.
---
System is over monetised, especially considering current and past context of build templates, it is limiting for more engaged players who play more than a few builds, it has functionality issues in some situations and is a bit more convoluted than people expected.
---
Other than that I think it is a good system.
---
These solutions really speak for themselves.
---
Disk storage rarely is the bottleneck, honestly.
---
careful, that sounds an awful lot like an opinion and not fact...
---
He lives in Germany, the chance can download the game in 2 hours is quite low.
---
So this is what we've come to? Anet now removes features, says they'll give them back, and then exievts praise? The fuck?
---
Microtransactions aren't for people in their right mind.
---
sylvari and (later) mordrem arent created the same.
---
the reason mordremoth can press dead plant matter into a mold and call it a day is because he absorbed zhaitans magic when it died. zhaitans risen and death magic therefore became a part of mordremoth, and he became able to create copies of dead bodies by using dead plant matter. he was also able to prosuce these copies rapidly so i presume the trailer isnt that far off. this is mentioned multiple times in the story and can be wiki’d
---
however sylvari (and presumably any mordrem that existed before the death of zhaitan) was born from a pod after growing like a plant. they can resemble any plants and range from more plant-like to more human-like. theyre bark and vine and whatever else you have in plants and their blood is reportedly golden sap or something iirc. but yeah, they grow ”naturally” and its not local flora being changed into a sylvari as far as i know
---
i personally assume that where sylvari have the dream (and the nightmare), any mordrem born naturally (without zhaitans magic) probably directly traversed mordremoths consciousness since his thing is ”mind”, which is interesting. not touched upon in the story tho cuz mordremoth is written in pretty heavyhandedly super evil and whatnot, hah
---
Don't worry, I am neutral as well. Especially since the last raid wing that made me quit
---
I would prefer a subscription model over this nickel and diming model.
---
I want to believe it was not purposely removed - if I were a developer, this is something I would not have considered. And I don't think they expect praise for any of this. Anet has historically released sub-par content and improved it at later dates to be very very good. I am not worried. They want the players to be happy.
---
I had no trouble reading this, but i'm on a computer so I can imagine it being more difficult on mobile.
---
I don't think they are any worse than any others.  Many are cumulative achievements (kill 'x' number of enemies, etc).   The problem is though as one point, there was no reason for me to return to the map, so the only way to progress on those achievements would be to zone in to the map JUST to do achievements, and I'm not bored enough to do that.
---
The issue is there is no reason to be on that map.  The meta events are mostly fun, but the end reward isn't worth the time/effort required.
---
It's the same magic. What makes it less sinister is the *intention of how to use the magic*. Using plants to create mordrem/sylvari isn't sinister. Imprisoning sentient beings in pods to create exact clones via local plants, which is why sylvari are made from an abstract notion of humans, and not living human bodies.
---
&gt; the amount of free time is very liberating.
---
Maybe do yourself another favour and free up even more time by leaving the subreddit of the game you already uninstalled?
---
I feel the need to clear some things up because I am seeing a tend in the comments:
---
1. Build Templates really wouldn't have had an affect on these numbers, it's too recent.
---
2. Not all mastery achievements are created equal
---
3. This does not necessarily reflect the time/effort/enjoyment that people get out of each chapter
---
4. Adding more achievements that fewer people do is not necessarily a bad thing, and having more to do may result in lower completion rates
---
5. Mastery dropped off hard at the start of PoF, though the expansion was very well received for the first few months
---
6. Games age, it's a normal thing to lose player-effort over time
---
7. Expansions are big named products that attract interest, and this can lend to more activity in the current LS content when announced
---
I don't stop moving either. W keeps me moving forward while my hand is off my mouse.
---
oh, ok.
---
what kind of tart argument is that?
---
Adjusting the price for people who just play casual and only play with the same 1-2 builds anyways in every gamemode and not towards people who actually optimize themself for every gamemode and enconter, actually needing build templates is just stupid.
---
&gt; 1.) Change the name: They're not templates, they're loadouts. Name them as such
---
While I agree with the more specific name, as soon as you have a code for the build it is a template, so the GW2 version of this is really a mix between templates and loadouts. though I would say gear = loadout and build = template. Players will still call it templates so sticking to the name just to not create confusion.
---
&gt; 2.) Make the actual templates (the account bound builds) storage local and unlimited: you do it in GW1, why not here
---
Personally, I would like to have this back. Load and save builds on your own computer than somewhere in the game.
---
&gt; 5.) make legendaries not require transmutation charges to swap skins, and make skins part of the equipment loadouts (e.g: using eternity with the eternity skin in slot 1 and the sovereign skin in slot 2)
---
As soon as they add skins to this they already have to touch transmutations as well because it wouldn't make much sense in the first place to pay for transmutations each time you switch a "loadout".
---
But for that you probably would also need to make skins their own slot entirely. Currently every skin is bound to an equipment and is getting overwritten. with this being changed with each time a template is equipped applying the skin from scratch wouldn't make much sense to me.
---
I would imagine that something like how outfits work would fit perfectly for this just expanded to every single slot that you can adjust the skin of. it would overwrite the "look" of the gear while not being applied to it in the first place. This could even be extended to outfits as well in which you could have different templates with different outfits.
---
&gt; 6.) split loadouts per game mode (obviously having PvP loadouts too (amulet, sigils, runes and weapons)
---
From what I have read and heard the max amount of character bound templates already has a limit and IIRC it was a technical limitation. If you then split it on each game mode you have at least 3 times the number of templates. So you would throw your technical limitation out of the window if it is because of deeper issues like data storage etc. You would also want to edit those things outside of that particular game mode so the UI would be pretty crowded.
---
Personally, I would prefer something like a Flag or Category that you can set on the template itself and when entering the game mode switches to automatically. That would not increase the amount of build you have but would stay the same and in sync of their limitations, if it is really a technical limitation.
---
oh, it is an opinion, for me to be able to provide the information (or you, for this matter), we'd need to be able to access Bethesda's data in order to evaluate the ongoing cost, servers, etc.
---
But the value of a product is never a fact. Its cost, yes, its value, no.
---
that wouldnt be a bad idea, i'd love gw2 version of henchmen/heroes from gw1.
---
When did I say I spent hundreds of thousands? I've spent MAYBE a thousand on this game. If I spent $20/month (roughly the price of a monthly sub for most sub fee games) it would amount to $1700 since launch. That's actually pretty close to what I've spent. Going back through my "thank you for purchasing gems" emails it looks like I've spent just about $1400 on the game. Every tim I bought gems it was in $10 increments and it was usually once or twice a month, sometimes more if I was having a guild event and needed prizes. How i nthe absolute fuck is spending $1400 on a game over the course of 7 years make me a whale you absolute walnut?
---
So:
---
1) you would like to be able to choose build template slot as a default for given game mode, so it would be set as active when changing game mode? 
---
2) you propose something like.. automatic propagating upgrades for legendary gear with identical chosen in first loadout they are slotted in already would be a feature you would like to have, (so they are never being inserted into a build without upgrades)?
---
They should have provided an automatic use of build in specified zone option.  Allow you to designate a certain build as the automatic one one for jumping into PvE, PvP, WvW, Raid, and Fractal.  That was kinda what we already had, they could have made it better by expanding the zones linked with automatic builds.
---
I play a Condi Trapper with Longbow, Axe/Torch. I get on as I'm a casual player in PVE.
---
Ship sunk move on...
---
&gt; Sorry but you are white-knighting.
---
People seriously are overusing this term nowadays. White-knighting is when you defend something completely and absolutely, taking in no doubts at all about it, believing that is 100% right. They did specifically say they are pretty neutral about it, and do have some grievances with it.
---
But no, if you aren't following the deep seeded hatred of the mob mentality and don't absolutely hate Anet and don't believe the game is dying you are absolutely wrong and obviously being a white-knight? For fucks sake people.
---
Ummm, 
---
1) Yes. That's a feature that was literally removed yesterday. 
---
2) Again, I guess? That's a feature that was *removed* yesterday. Legendary weapons should just have their Sigils/Infusions in them the same way that Ascended Weapons do, but only change if you've changed them for that template. 
---
Those are literally 2 things that worked the way they were intended to, a day ago. They removed features to add this system in.
---
Bullshit, anet archteture is very good, a game of 2008 with features better than a lot of current mmorpg games, the problem is others...
---
That setup is intentional, and will persist even at max level.  Enemy levels generally cap at 80, just like players, but the game features scaling for dynamic events, having more players present in events will cause higher level enemies to spawn.  This can generate event-related enemies between level 81-84 during max level events, providing more of a challenge when lots of players are participating and trivializing things.
---
At your level, just be careful.  Enemies with higher level than you will have their level coloured differently, so if you see NPCs with yellow, orange or red levels, consider exploring somewhere else for a while.  If you feel like you've exhausted all the places your level, you have waypoints for all five newbie zones unlocked by default, so you can go to a different one and start exploring anew.  You still gain worthwhile XP for doing things in areas beneath your level, so don't be afraid of doing so!
---
lol I wonder if those 4 ppl got migraine with 1 experienced player helping.
---
Dude, just... stop.
---
Bullshit, anet architecture is very good, a game of 2012 with features better than a lot of current mmorpg games, the problem is others...
---
Fear not this night!
---
This is probably the most accurate and genuine explanation to the situation even if people don't like to see/read it.
---
But didn't people change their build before too? Before it just changed your traits, not your weapons and armor. I play berserker ele in PVE but when entered wvw I needed to change my armor manually because playing zerk sword weaver in wvw would be suicide.
---
Even if it were totally free and unlimited this system would still be worse than arcdps.  unbelievable!  This update made me very worried about the future of the game, I don't know if it is in good hands
---
&gt;So I basically have less than a minute (because loading screens) to change my entire trait lines, organize my utilities and elite, and possibly more?!
---
While frustrating, the build templates allow you to change your trait lines, organize your utilities and elites in under a second.
---
That's exactly what happens. I do the same thing. I'm opting to to do PvE in my PvP builds so I don't accediently fight with a completely different build. It's a huge downer and feels bad.
---
I agree, there's some interesting possibilities. Maybe rainbow, and glittering sparkly titles? =D (and an option to see titles in default like they are now, lol)
---
I don't know, you tell me your the one who started the conversation between us.  My first statement was:
---
&gt; Also it sounds like your trying to say dps meters are TOS compliant. They are not, reading game memory isn't tos compliant, but just like build templates, if you use them without being a bad person, its fine.
---
A factual statement
---
And the same goes for wvw, this is a jerk move from anet to have even less slots available for builds if you don't pull out your wallet, what a fucking joke.
---
I think what it actually meant was that the questions or any ideas that get downvoted is like saying "uhh that's a dumb question/idea" without considering any thought. It's like neglecting anything in sight.
---
Everything would be fine if Anet would've just left ArcDPS templates alone. *Of course* people are going to throw a shitfit if you take away what they had and re-sell them a worse version of the same functionality for hundreds of euros. No shit!
---
Highly invested players can still have their 150 builds for every ocassion, maybe buy a few slots for convenience (insta swaps rule), and the overwhelming majority that is the rest of the playerbase will be thrilled to have actual, officially supported, in-game templates for free with the option to pay for more.
---
Boom, done.
---
Well, fix some bugs and oversights like removal of all upgrades from legendaries if swapped and stuff like that, and then boom, done.
---
&gt; That's not because Guild Wars drew some short straw for players, it's because the decisions by ANet make their community react that way.
---
I remmember the good old days where our community was considered (one of) the best and most positive community in gaming and especially MMORPGs
---
Now i see nothing but complaints all day and the occasional positive new player post who had never been on the subreddit before and says ‘wow playing for a month and this is the best shit’
---
Only to never see then again on reddit cus damn its toxic
---
&gt;Yup, I know, but what I meant was that before this update, when entering PvP or WvW, the game would use your last used build
---
tbh, as someone who rarely entered wvw or pvp, this was actually a rather annoying feature. Would be nice if there was a tick box option (enable this Build Template when entering WvW) or something. Similar to a tick box for gear (enable this Build Template when wearing Gear Template #)
---
Wouldn't surprise me one bit, runescape 3 already has something similar. Cough, runemetrics.
---
If you don't opt to use the slots for other builds anywhere else in the game.
---
Brought to you by one average gw2 Reddit user.
---
This looks much easier than condi thief which BTW got nerfed a few days ago.
---
tbh, in my experience in gw2, wow and ffxiv, it's usually just reddit that's bad. I've had mostly positive experiences in all 3 games, with the odd duck of toxicity here or there. Reddit just makes it seem like everything is a dumpster fire.
---
That said, I'd say that WoW and FFXIV's subreddit have more positive stuff mixed in with the negative, than GW2.
---
Yeah. I might \*might\* do it if they go on a fire sale some day. They're worth like 100 gems, max. Same with build template slots.
---
Afaik Mike Z is very experienced player, he knows alot about the game from almost every perspective. Same goes for Ben P which was lately promoted to design menager. They know what the game needs, but for some reason they decide to push this absolutely ridiculous vision for the game that clearly doesn't work.
---
Mix that with lack of/incompetent CM and few fucking donkeys that is ANets PR team and we have recipe for a disaster.
---
With lab farming going on during Halloween festival I haven't seen a RIBA map recently.  With a RIBA map I was getting from around 10-12 shovels per meta run.  (I need shovels too for a guild, but dont mind farming them.)  Trying to do it without RIBA map us like you saw for a drop rate, too few events to tag and move on like during RIBA upping the chances for shovels, but rather without RIBA you having to complete the event yourself slowing down chances of getting shovels.
---
&gt; You make it sound like no MMO has ever made an unpopular decision or lost people due to a bad choice. That's just not the case. It's happened with almost every MMO I've played.
---
More like crying over sunk cost fallacy. We would have wanted to believe in this game and keep playing it. Disappointment.
---
Name 1 game without a bug
---
because they designed the system with pay to use mentality first and  functionality later
---
I mean that is the point. You went from 3 build templates that auto swapped, to 3 build templates that manually swap and that can be used n more game modes.
---
If you want pvp/wvw/pve builds, then us them that way, but if you want 3 different builds for a single game mode, use it that way.
---
(I'm not saying I like this system, but I'm clarifying that having a minute to organize stuff is not a downgrade from before).
---
its better to post your selfies to r/roastme
---
selfie?
---
Yea I feel that, I wish I could feel the same. I love archeage to death and back, but the community is awful, it's so hard to find any information about the game given how competitive everyone is, and Gamigo unbanning the exploiters really rubbed me the wrong way lol. I hope you do get your money's worth out of it, and hopefully I'll get a drive to play again soon cause I met some awesome people during release week, and I miss em haha.
---
Have you looked into ffxiv at all? It's a pretty big change from stuff like AA:U and GW2, but I'd honestly say it's one of the best MMO's on the market as of right now. The sub fee pays for itself with how much there is to do in the game. The only downside I'd say it has is how PvP is kind of a side thing, since the game is very PvE centric. Don't get me wrong, the pvp is amazing and I have a ton of fun with it, but it's nothing on the same level as what ESO, AA:U, or GW2 has, which is kind of a bummer.
---
Set up hotkeys. You'll get used pressing them every time when changing gamemode. For me, pressing hotkeys are already automatic reflexes.
---
Try this: Set up traits/skills to SHIFT + number and gear to CTRL + number. Then press both SHIFT + CTRL + number same time. Not sure if this works, haven't tested. Anyway, if it does not work, just press buttons quickly after each other.
---
that he's the reason for the state of the games industry.  you're giving way too much power and credence, lol.
---
How did we get to the point that we're all circlejerking about build templates?
---
It's because Anet hasn't given us anything else to talk about. Anything else to look forward to. Anything else to be hyped about.
---
They did this. Not us. Backlash of hate, then backlash of love, then circling back on itself to shame the community for our opinions. That's a totally common cycle when there's not enough content to go around.
---
What's your name?
---
I could like.... buy template expansion if it was bound per account! Just realized that build template and gear templates are bound to character. So if I want to have like 5 unlocked then I got to pay around 3200gems per char.   
---
12 chars makes this 38400 gems.  
---
So around 300 euro for gems?  
---
I would rather buy new accounts and run bots on them to sell gold....
---
whats wrong with wrel?
---
I only unsubbed from ff14 reddit a week ago, (cus im not paying sub for a good few months now) and its true, on reddit for ff14 i rarely see people shitting on stuff except dragoon and samurai
---
Other than that its mostly positive over there
---
You really don't need templates for open pve. Just play with a build you're most comfortable with.
---
Make a build to the template to try out another "meta" open world build for variety.
---
Abaddon's Ascent
---
But that’s exactly what he did... he puts a disclaimer to cover himself. But then goes on a tangent blaming the playerbase for ruining the game and driving new players away. 
---
It’s not the fact that Anet keeps making choices that prioritize money over the playerbase. Rather than designing something people really like that they’d love to/be happy to support. 
---
Or the fact that content has been slowing down for years now, with many modes being stagnant, and Anet seemingly not caring much about it except mostly empty promises of what’s to come. Or the fact that Anet spent years and resources on projects that got axed that cost the company almost a third of their employees, or that the creative and talented employees get axed while the management that is apparently really bad, stays to keep making poor decisions. 
---
OP doesn’t really address any of those points or all the others that are actually leading to the stagnation of this game. Instead he attacks the playerbase for being upset and voicing their thoughts and feelings BECAUSE the game seems to be slowly spiraling out. 
---
He’s literally blaming the customers for a product that Anet is failing to maintain. How is that anything other than defending Anet?
---
Don't worry, be happy!
---
Man thats a tough one I'd have to say the mad king clock tower only available during Halloween because I get good at it but then the following year I suck at it and have to learn it again.
---
You're trying to correlate stand-alone bugs throughout a game with thousands of features, to a singular feature plagued with a plethora of bugs. 
---
There's a difference. Don't be so naive as to stick your head in the sand about it.
---
If you want me to name specific features in games which were launched with no bugs... then the answer would be about 99% of features in 99% of games. That includes GW2 as well.
---
Yeah, I getcha.
---
&gt;I'm low maintenance and a WvW player
---
For me, I'm a very different player. Ultimately, the main reason I play MMORPGs is actually for the longevity and persistence of my character. I like the story that keeps going on, and the main social experience I partake in are meta's and achievement hunting with my wife. So consistent content is actually a must for my interests.
---
&gt;hey make a lot of shitty choices and I've been less than happy with the game more than once.
---
Frankly, I think it comes down to the original business model of B2P. Naturally, conveniences and skins need to be added to the store to make money, BUT skins need to be obtainable in game as well due to the horizontal progression nature of the game. Thus, the best way to make money is really to implement things like conveniences in the store, and the only way to do that is to purposefully program in inconveniences into the game. It's a crappy monetization model.
---
Personally, I'd prefer it if they either took the GW1 model, or a sub model. That is, purchase campaigns in lump sums, or purchase a sub monthly. This would be predictable revenue for them, predictable expenses for us, and it would feel like the cost is 'worth it'. For me, $10 for an armor skin is not worth it, but $15 for unlimited game access is (even though it's free right now). Alternatively, if they just charged for the campaign drops (I.e. season 5 will be $60, or whatever) and everything else in game was included (skins, mount skins, conveniences etc.) then that'd work too.
---
I think another notable issue about the monetization policy is this... They make the game B2P, which essentially means you can play for free. That means that it will attract people who don't want to spend money, and thus when it comes time to charge for basics, those people will be annoyed.
---
&gt;It's good that people have the passion to write complaints but I think too many of them are nothing but pure rage and hyperbole, often getting enough support to reach the front page. This sub may not influence the entire game, but it's influence isn't irrelevant either. 
---
I think the greater side effect of this is not the negative impressions on new players, but the lack of communication from Arena Net. If all they see are hyperbole or rage posts, they're going to be less likely to engage with us.
---
Goemm's Lab.
---
I think a big step to improve it would be a UI allowing you to mark builds as preferred for a specific game mode so that you still get the auto switching.
---
The other big issue I see (other than quantity limitations) is the legendary weapon swap issue.  If you want to use a different weapon type and unequip a legendary to do so, when you put it back you need to reset all its stats and upgrades.  However that's a design flaw rather than a bug and I don't see a simple solution around it.  Maybe equipment save slots similar to build save slots, but it wouldn't need to be account shared.
---
I also hear that the process needs to be done in the Lion's Arch mystic forge, specifically, but I have ALSO heard of people who still weren't able to make it there. It's worth a shot!

There are no jumping puzzles in PoF (One Jackal Portal Puzzle)

This subreddit used to be good, the first mayor backlash I remember is the HoT announcement.
---
Original lore interviews said that sylvari are "the Pale Tree's interpretation of humans". In GW1 there was a small human and centaur settlement that included Ronan and Ventari.
---
It's unknown why Malyck has his humanoid appearance but it's not like the Maguuma was void of humans (see: White Mantle and bandits and exiles). But he's not completelu forgotten. Last year around April a dev, Matthew Medina, began writing a story for Malyck. Unfortunately he was among the layoffs and we don't know if somronr picked it up aftet.
---
I’d argue that yes, it makes sense. I was an idiot and upgraded my max bag slot main character to full 32 slot bags + the full set of shared inventory slots... it’s a nightmare of inventory space. So things are harder to organize, and I’m considering just banking the 1k gold of bags, or throwing them onto my storage character. 
---
As well, If you give the user *too much* space, they sometimes just store everything, forever, and never get into salvaging or selling. Hurts the market (though admittedly only a small amount) if 5% of users just don’t sell stuff. 
---
Not to mention, there *is* still some technical reasoning, even if it’s less impactful now. You need to store that data, plus multiple backups. And tables get kinda unruly when you get into the billions of records.
---
So much this.
---
It's alright, I was 100% prepared for some of the hostility going on here. In fact, I expected worse to the point I'd be downvoted in to invisibility. Would have been fine had it ended that way, I just wanted to toss in my two cents.  
---
I figured it'd be a good idea to be clear that I'm not asking people to blindly allow ANet to anally fuck them for all the money they're worth, and that I don't support them when they make poor decisions, just to be safe. But in typical Reddit fashion, "you're wrong, I'm right. You're little, I'm big."
---
That was a great one! Did it recently, when it was a daily. :D
---
Nah, just create a new character and go to your inventory. There should only be one slot for shared inventory which will contain the boost.
---
None because I can't do them unless I have a teleport to friend with someone who's at the end of it.
---
I usually dislike jumping puzzles but for some reason I really enjoy Wall Breach Blitz in Diessa Plateu. It's quite easy and fun.
---
Yep would be a great and simple “fix” for me and the rest of us lazier players (but who still enjoy all game modes equally but really enjoyed the old system of switching automatically so I don’t have to switch my build standing in pve yet on que for pvp and then have to even switch back when matches end and I return from the que back to pve land)
---
Thanks, I'll try the seasonal one when it's up again and the two others sooner. :D
---
Or just set the build template for pvp to a hotkey
---
I buy an old heroic key for a few euros from game trading subreddits every now and then. You can still find them there.
---
I guess because no dulfy guides anymore :(
---
I mean, it's ANet, they always try to re-invent the wheel or fix something that isn't broken.
---
&gt; If you take into consideration we had nothing before current templates, then they are welcomed.
---
You welcome half baked buggy shit that you are being nickle and dime'd for!? Seriously go read the bug posts just on reddit. Build templates are destroying upgrades, dupeing infusions, crashing maps WITH resets so you lose w/e loot/ap you did in the last 20+min, resetting wvw maps, do not function like a "template", have clunky af usability (outside of the hot keys), you are charged 500 gems for 3 lines on a glorified note pad, the list goes on and on. This update has been a bigger shit show that any other that I can remember.
---
subscriptions are something not everyone can afford, but if youve spent thousands on gems then im pretty confident this isnt a problem for you. but yeah, its possible to play gw2 entirely without buying anything. a lot of the monetization is skins, and then the rest is quality of life things like bank/storage/inventory slots. do they help, to the point of feeling mandatory? well yeah. but its still possible to play the game without them
---
very different from like, say ESO, where its technically f2p but without the subscription you can barely do anything thats standard fare for the subscribers. for gw2, buying anything isnt mandatory, and i would say a lot of people who cant afford subscriptions can sporadically affort to spend ten euros or something to get something nice or useful once in a while which racks up
---
also with FFXIV, WOW, ESO, we have a lot of subscription-based mmos. but gw2 is still chugging on and thats also one of the draws of this game. you can pick it up and check it out, be busy for half a year and come back.
---
Very true and I'm forever grateful for those that do this. I always tip!
---
As an experienced player I consider anything less than T4 or Platinum mediocre.  I can pretty much AFK through my rotation in T2 w/o boons and do anywhere from 40-60% of *total* group DPS in T2.  Furthermore, being gold in S19 after something like 2/3rds of the PvP inclined player-base has left or only plays in the mATs is pretty *yikes*  sPVP is infested with bots and being in gold is pretty much inexperienced/average at this point.  It's like being proud of a bronze medal because with a greater population distribution (in earlier seasons) you'd have a significantly lower ranking (eg; current platinum is equivalent to gold in earlier seasons).
---
Happened to me as well. Nothing you can do, Just accept it. Happens to everyone eventually.
---
I have been asking Anet for a colorblind-friendly option of high-contrast colors since launch. I have green/red colorblindness and PvP in general is really frustrating. I don't really WvW mainly because this reason; everybody is a "friendly" for me. I can't detect the red, let alone a blue title. For all I care if it was for me I'd have black health bars with white text for enemies.
---
Deltaconnected was able to build **THIS** in a **CAVE**!  With a box of **SCRAPS**!
---
Well I'm sorry, but I'm not Deltaconnected.
---
That and the episodes themselves feel like self-contained little boxes. You do your story on this one map, then you leave for the next map and never return to the previous one because no upcoming story or achievements require you to go there. Each episode needs its own prologue, rising action, and spectacular finale, and then the story curve immediately gets reset down to 0 for the next episode. And they usually start with a mail or radio message that amounts to "yo there's a new episode, play it now!".
---
There have been slight improvements to this with tiny exceptions, namely War Eternal allowing you to start the episode from Thunderhead and War Eternal having optional achievement progress in previous maps (by that I mean you need to complete 4 objectives, and there's 4 basic objectives in the new map plus another two in other living world maps that you can do if you want to).
---
base game is free, she doesn't need to buy anything.
---
&gt; I know these thoughts will only be a drop in the ocean, and it's likely to get swarmed with those who are absolutely infuriated with the Templates, but I had to say something in the hopes it could at minimum cause a ripple in the water.
---
I have been playing the game for six years and while of course I see many things that could be better, I still love it. I would call myself a casual pve player, but even though they aren't my favourite part of the game, overtime I have got to the level where I can play more endgame content like fractals and easier raids. I made a reddit account just days ago, peeked in in this sub and the impact with the onslaught of negative, "this game is going down" opinions really startled me. Honestly, i was about to hightail it out of here and unjoin the sub when I scrolled to your thread and drew a breath of relief at seeing some more moderate opinions.
---
So there, I just wanted to tell you that, as part of that "remaining playerbase" you talk about, I really appreciated your ripple in the water, and will be sticking around the sub because of it. You made a random player's day a bit better ;)
---
You addressed the poster that was specifically referring to me and my post. So it would appear to me you were. Apologies if you weren’t.
---
Thats a good way to shoot themselves in the foot, players won't be very happy to have to start over
---
If you're taking anymore than 3 buckets to do Underground you're just going to have a bad time.  Most competent CM groups can burn the Dredge/Ice bosses down to like 30-40% in one bucket with 2 breaks.  The really good groups can just OHKO it or tank in one-spot with Kalla/FB.
---
That and accounts just stay on efficiency.
---
It is skewed toward more active and more dedicated players initially but if that player leaves the game, they probably won't delete their account on efficiency.
---
&gt;Honestly I think it should have been the opposite.
---
That's not the opposite of what I was saying; I didn't even mention the account storage at all. I think the account build storage should be free in addition to everything else I said in my comment above, because it is frankly beyond insulting to charge us just for the privilege of storing a tiny string of text on their servers.
---
It is hard to be positive when the developers (Anet) are such garbage.  I used to love gw2, I used to be passionate about gw2. But throughout the years Anet has demonstrated that they are incompetent. I will point out things I've pointed out numerous times already: PvP is lacking, WvW is lacking, raids are lacking, dungeons are forgotten, list goes on. The worst? NO COMMUNICATION and ROADMAP. I'd be much more forgiving if Anet just talked to us about what is going on, and how they plan on addressing issues the community has brought up time after time...
---
&gt;You do understand that most of their staff doesn't even know how to code right?
---
I fully understand that, but designers, artists, marketing are all expensive as well. We have designers on our dev teams and marketing sits in the same room. 
---
&gt;Their  actual development staff is absolutely minimal and they are evidently  stretched to the max, well either that or are completely incompetent.
---
You don't know this. Many times developers, designers, etc *are* limited by the environment they are in. You cannot plan for every eventuality and GW2 has had to make shifts multiple times in their dev cycle. Sometimes due to their own issues and other times due to the mixed messaging from the community about what kind of MMO they want.
---
&gt;Some  guy, made a dx12 wrapper for this game, in his bedroom, that alleviates  the problems that the "devs" (all 3.5 of them) couldn't fix for 7 years  now.
---
That's just a translation layer that takes DX9 calls and redirects them to DX12. I use something similar for playing on Linux - D9VK - that translates DX9 to Vulkan calls. Both improve performance..... most of the time.  Even the dx12 wrapper dev has talked about how it has the potential to be pretty buggy.
---
&gt;Look I'm sorry I have to say  it but that essay you just wrote? You aren't getting a job with them.  They don't care about your fanboyism.
---
I have no interest in a job with them, but I do get tired of the "It's so simple" attitudes. I used to be there, when I first got into tech and development. Reality hit me a few years ago and I realized that my work costs my employer money, so I couldn't just go refactoring something even if it was good as it had to be justified..... and it's really, really hard to justify fixing tech debt before you work on it. Probably even more so in game dev where profit comes from one-time sales, MTX, and DLC rather than an on-going subscription (which is how my company makes money)
---
Its mainly the second one, people arent running out of disk space, we dont buy more hard drives to fit gw2 on, we buy better graphics/cpu because the game isnt as optimized as it could be. Storage space is a lot easier to get right than optimized computing, a commenter above you just laid out minimum necessary storage space for this data.
---
You’re wrong actually, I’m not min maxing. Hell, I’m not even playing meta builds. It’s exactly because I like to have fun which is why I like to change my builds around to try different strategies to tackle a problem. But the current way the build system works makes this hard for me to do it swiftly and conveniently. 
---
So don’t judge before you speak, Necrotitis. Quite shameful tbh. Makes you look like a loser.
---
It's always been the case, not just months. LB ranger was always viable/dominating in pvp or wvw roaming (and lately it's been getting better and better in large scale).
---
Not yet.
---
They will be added at a later time.
---
im bad at jumping puzzles but i really liked the one that came with the prologue (youre not there yet i assume), since it was a good challenge for me to figure out where to jump and it wasnt like the one in draconis mons where you have to pull really wild tricks all the time. it was kinda fun too
---
but for the things currently available right now, the mad kings jumping puzzle. i hated it at first. first time i got to halloween i couldnt figure it out at all. i failed all the time. but this year i finally made it and now i can reliably enough complete it for dailies etc so its actually sort of fun since the appearing platforms and the scary murder sludge is actually exciting. if youre still where i was when i first tried the jp, all i can suggest is watching a video guide once or twice and just trying at it. the amount of times ive failed it must be so much higher than the completed tries, haha
---
as for other jps, i kinda like weyandt's revenge in lions arch. it has funny mechanics like the darkness and falling into a pit
---
OP just wants to check it out before buying. As such the free version is perfect for what they want
---
no. Theyd still have the same work ethic. The gemstore isnt that way because of lack of profits, its that way due to greed. They wouldnt have completely predatory practices if it wasnt.
---
I dont think episode mastery completion gives us much valuable info on how many players played the content and how much time they spent on each one.
---
Its a statistic about completionists from a subset of players that already has a high amount of completionists.
---
Personally, I only have 4 episode masteries (3 from season 3 and 1 from season 1) yet I earned and forged both season specific legendary trinkets, which requires a huge amount of content completion for all twelve episodes.
---
Yes, unless you have a trait template ready for pvp then you have to manually switch to it PLUS  equip weapons needed. I guess runes and attributes are still the same from the last one. It's really weird how it is set up right now 😕
---
Maybe gold would have been a better color
---
Honestly, I'm all for a premium sub, or even a multi-tiered sub if it would mean less greedy tactics overall. 
---
Basic tier 1 ($5): 1 black lion key, permanent boost (while sub is active) n% xp, karma and magic find (n = dollars for sub)
---
Standard tier 2 ($10): As above, plus one 'freebie' per month (a t-shirt, mini, balloon, etc.), one random dye, 10% gem store discount
---
VIP Tier 3 ($15): As above, but gem store discount is 20% and black lion keys are x3 (or 1x golden key), one lounge pass of your choice, swapable once per month, up to 3x makeovers per month, +50% bank space, auto-item booster while in home instance, access to VIP chat. 
---
These are mostly cosmetic extras, boosts that aren't really game-changing, and take nothing away from people who don't sub. I've not mentioned build templates in any of these tiers as in an ideal world they'd be free.
---
And if its an absolute no to a sub model, then at least release more supply drop requisitions, like, once a month or something, not twice a year.

Pretty sure Jesus wouldn't be caught dead with anything GW2 related right now
---
Erm yep i actually mainly play Wvw and a little of pvp, but i havent checked the pvp after update so there is that if they replace the old system that was separated from wvw or pve, then that sucks tbh.
---
But for Wvw like i said, i have no issues with this w/e system they implement for the reasons i mention above.
---
This might be bad for raiders that run 10 builds or so, but to be honest anet will Try to monetize this somehow, i guess Thats why they removed from them pvp.
---
I would actually love if they bring back gw1 build system, million times better, but doubt it considering the companies this days.
---
Also for the downvote on top i totally understand, but like you, i have an opinión wether its correct or not, that depends.
---
But for "MY" personal playstyle it didnt change or affect me as much, but i can understand others having issues.
---
Also What i said about those that say "subing to wow", seriously every game mmo i see that comment, and honestly saying that doesnt make companies change at all
---
Mu guard have quickbrand, condibrand, power, codi, heal, condi quickbrand BASE pve builds, add fb, dh and core build for pvp, and fb for wvw. And I'm a filthy casual
---
I really like the one in the Silverwastes. It covers huge areas that you only access with the jumping puzzle, and it's a lot of fun exploring.
---
The day Mike O'Brein left ANET is the day that it was confirmed that they're not working on GW3.
---
Pvp gear works a bit differently, so they stated pvp templates are coming later.
---
Action cam helps. I also thought it was hopeless but finally got it with action cam and some heavy training :).
---
Now I can reliably finish it once every 2 to 3 tries! Feels good :)
---
Keep trying!
---
Are you... talking about youtubers and celebrities...? I... no. I don't care about that, I care about playing games and having fun. Deciding on a game is utterly irrelevant to this entire conversation. Who cares about streamers? I'm talking about the video games themselves. They were simply more fun 15+ years ago than they are today (and video games made 15+ years ago but played today are included in that - it's the game, not the time or nostalgia).
---
Lack of talent seems harsh. The games artists are making beautiful areas and designs, the raid teams have made some incredible encounters, class teams did great with elite spec concepts, etc.
---
ANets problem has always been communication and management.
---
You serious? Load up the default glider sometime then ask yourself where you can get better skins in the actual game...
---
Yeah, but Guild Wars 2 just got BUILD TEMPLATES added, and....oh wait....
---
&gt; I'll be the first to admit that the state of the sub is depressing. It makes me not want to play seeing so much negativity, but a lot of it is also justified and yeah the last thing we want this sub to be is turn into the forums where literally anything negative is removed. With regards to ANet being involved, I've personally reached out a couple times and unfortunately have not heard anything back. We would love to get them more involved here but we would not ever let them control or censor discussion. In my opinion and I believe the rest of the team, and open, honest, and safe discussion space is good for the health of the game so all opinions can come out. It's just unfortunate that for the past few months the majority of those opinions are incredibly negative. It's a tough decision to make and the last thing we want to have happen is a riot against us for censorship.
---
I have been a dedicated player since launch and also always talked alot about the game, the first 4 years on the official forums and then I moved over to reddit for the obvious reasons everybody is stating.
---
During the 4 years on the forums, most of my posts and comments were within the CoC and I like to think that plenty of my contributions over there were constructive feedback towards the game, helpful to other players or healthy discussions with other users/devs.
---
However, every once in a while, I slipped up, posted a insulting comment in the heat of the discussion or made a troll post to derail a discussion.
---
The problem wasnt that I particularly disagreed with the decision that those slip ups breached the CoC, it was the infraction system that I found unfair for players like me that posted a lot.
---
The average forum user at that time might have posted 500 comments over the course of a full year while I posted 500 comments in a week. I think its normal that everybody slips up once in a while and conducts themselves in a way that isnt appropriate. When that average user had one comment of 500 infracted, that wasnt too much of a problem for them, they would get a warning, maybe an infraction point and their post gets deleted. And after a certain amount of time without any more infractions, their infraction points would be removed from their account.
---
If I had 1 of 500 comments infracted, it meant I got one every week, infractions piled up and forum bans followed but not because my general conduct was so far worse than the one of the average player, my only fault was that I was posting a lot and my good/constructive posts had absolutely no influence on how my general conduct was perceived/recorded.
---
So 3 years ago, I decided to open a reddit account and start discussing the game over here. It was great, I loved the freedom of speech granted over here, the dev interaction (which at that time was far better here than on the forums) and also the general layout/UI of reddit compared to the clunky forums.
---
It also seemed that most players that actually had valuable feedback for the game or were interested in healthy discussions about the game, had done the same switch and made up the mayority of the reddit community, so the "content" posted here was way more "valuable" or worth reading/participating in than on the forums.
---
3 years on, the "freedom of speech" is still here but unfortunately, in my opinion, it has become more of a burden than a boon for this community. In the first 18 months I have been here, it fostered (mostly) healthy discussion and constructive feedback, nice dev interaction and entertaining content that wasnt geared towards suitability for a pg-13 game but entertaining value for a mostly adolescent or adult user base.
---
But now, that "freedom of speech" is mainly misused by trolls and salty ex-players, which unfortunately started to make up the mayority of your user base for a couple of months now, if not longer. The devs are gone too and good feedback or healthy and constructive discussions are far and few between nonconstructive personal rants, valueless shitposts and memes. And if some good feedback or discussion does come up, it gets either downvoted or derailed by your userbase because it is now mainly interested in their own personal agendas and not what is best for the game in general.
---
Yesterday, the top post was a picture of a kid dressing up as steve from the labyrinth but after a couple of hours, OP decided to delete it because he thought sharing how much fun his son is having during the holidays wasnt worth all the abuse that was hurled at him in the comments from people thinking they should lecture him on how to raise his kid.
---
That incident really made me feel ashamed of being a part of this community but unfortunately it is an accurate reflection of what it has become.
---
Its not my intention to solely shift the blame for that on the moderation team, in the end, everybody has to change their behaviour and input/effort they contribute, the moderation team, your sub users and Anet to make this a healthy community again.
---
You guys are trying to moderate this community by your own choice during your free time because you have the best interest for the game at heart and especially during times like these, its an ungrateful job, so kudos for that. Taking up responsibility is the first step and usually along with that you will inevitably have community members disagreeing with you and you wont win a sympathy contest with it, no matter what you do. But right now, it seems your stance of applying as little moderation as possible isnt really working in the best interest of the game anymore and you basically GGed because you are either afraid of changing it or dont have the capacity to do it.
---
And with capacity i mean 2 things. First of all man power. Despite of all I just said, I know that you guys are actually moderating and deleting quite a bit but I guess in order to execute any kind of adequate moderation in days like this, you would need at least half a dozen moderators spending a couple of hours every day (if not more) to actively moderate and currently, you dont have that.
---
Another capacity that you guys may be missing is the personal experience or knowledge on how to moderate, build or foster healthy communities, which is nothing to be ashamed of because if you open up the newspaper, you will see that even the world leaders are struggling with it every day.
---
I was fortunate enough to be a part of hundreds of different communities in real life, around the world and often in a leading role. Many of these communities where quite unique in the fact that they were quite small and isolated from the rest of the world in terms of location and also sometimes communication, for example, ships, small atolls/islands in the middle of an ocean or landlocked remote research stations/tourism resorts.
---
Those communities are basically the complete opposite of the r/guildwars2 community, where members can join, participate and leave almost instantly and anonymously at the press of a button. Those small, isolated communities were very much "in your face", sometimes 24/7, most members knew each other personally and many of them were also far from perfect. But while they ran the same risk of escalation as your online community does, the consequences of an escalation were usually way more severe or intense than they are here but their isolated status (they are basically microcosms without all the distractions from the outside world) and intense personal interaction/knowledge/general appreciation between its members also provided an awesome environment for conflict resolution. 
---
End of part 1 (there is a 10k character limit on posts it seems) and it seems this post got too long.
---
Start of part 2:
---
The reason why I am telling you this example is that it may provide you with a solution or improvement on how to moderate your community more successfully and efficiently.
---
If I would have to give a TL/DR of my current opinion about the moderation on this sub it would be that its not sufficient and hasnt been for quite some months now, if it wants to be a place that is beneficial to the majority of its users or the health of the game in general. And this is due to one of two reasons:
---
Either the moderation team in its current state isnt capable of moderating this sub due to the limited manpower or knowledge it has, in which case the moderation team needs an overhaul or additions, or the sub is too big or has too many diverse and conflicting interests for the current moderation team to handle, in which case, the userbase needs to be trimmed down.
---
Both approaches are probably valid and could be successful. Adding additional capacities to the mod team doesnt really require any explanation I hope, the only challenge will be finding suitable moderators that have the required capacities and knowledge to be a useful addition to the team. 
---
But I want to explain why i think it might be a good idea to trim the userbase and how to do it.
---
After I joined reddit to participate in this sub, I became moderator of 2 other game-related subs, r/gw2economy and later r/gw2exchange which were focussed on parts of the game and discussions/posts about it that werent really welcome here. buy/sell/trade offers for in game items were banned already when i joined, regardless of being it for RM or in game items and any attempt of any kind of constructive posts/discussions about the economy by big traders like me usually got downvoted and trolled/derailed by the rest of the community suspecting market manipulation as the main objective of each post.
---
When I took over moderation of the economy sub it was basically a wasteland with no posts in years (it was created by someone else at launch who already left the game soon after) but it gave me the opportunity to post mostly interesting and valuable content for other players regarding trading and the economy and foster/moderate healthy discussions to a minimum. To my surprise, the amount of moderation time i had to use to review posts and comments, ban people or delete comments that broke the rules was a bare minimum. Well, I read most of the posts and comments anyways for their content, so reviewing wasnt really a chore but I needed to spend next to no time responding to reports or working myself through the moderation queue and could focus on the part of moderation that was actually fun to me: Creating related and constructive content myself and giving other players the chance to do the same or a place to learn about it.
---
With the exchange, we faced a different kind of challenges. u/dandaze created it in order to offer a more or less regulated market without rmt where players could trade in game items for gold p2p without using the trading post (a tax haven, so to speak). But considering how closely intwined RMT and p2p trading are, this was quite challenging and took quite an effort. Some time after its creation, dan asked me to come aboard as moderator. I dont think I knew dan very good at that time (i dont know him very good on a personal level now neither, dont even know if his real name is dan) and I think his main reasons to ask me was because I had some kind of elevated standing in the trading community (in game trading, not outside trading) and he just needed a back up in case RL commitments would prevent him from logging in vor a longer period of time. He also knew about my strict stance against RMT trading and my critical views about the exchange I had when he created it. While I lurked his sub and often commented on buy/sell offers or participated in general discussions, I never really used it personally as a trading platform as I prefer the trading post and dont mind paying the fees for it for the sake of safety and health of the game economy in general.
---
But those two stances were also part of the reason why he asked me to come aboard because he knew it would be a challenge to create a safe market place with credible users and keep it RMT free. It required plenty of grunt moderation work, deleting posts, banning users, drama moderation and also working with a senior Anet GM in a constructive manner.
---
But due to my mostly critical stance towards the idea of the exchange in general and my natural hate towards RMTers, I didnt mind putting in all the time and playing the bad guy as moderator. And after 2 years of hard work and 3 more additions to the moderation team, the exchange is basically set up quite nicely and runs more or less on auto-mode. Scams were more or less eradicated and if they happened, it was mostly due to neglect of the scammed person and not our fault. 
---
Both examples show that smaller gw2-related fansubs for specific content can be quite successful, if they are properly moderated and their respective moderators arent just there to enforce the rules but also are relevant content creators. 
---
And by now, posts about the economy or trading items, which used to create a good amount of drama on your sub, are more or less eradicated, which means they are less work for you and in hands of players/moderators that really care about those specific issues.
---
So maybe its worth considering contacting mods of other related subreddits to see, if they are interested in reviving some of the already existing subs, if you ban related content over here and force players to use them instead of the general sub.
---
Or try to find new moderators for specific content that doesnt have a dedicated sub yet or only an abandoned one.
---
Just bought Prey for 50% off on Steam.  My son said it was fun and the reviews seem mostly positive, and did you know that Epstein didn't kill himself?
---
The gemstore would stay as is.
---
So I get the disappointment when switching game types...  I had the same reaction because frankly I forgot my build for WVW for the toon I logged onto to start with making my templates...
---
But... your fucking reaction to leave the game?  Are you serious?  Good fucking riddens you sour spoiled fuck.    
---
The company makes templates for you, sorry they are not ideal for your exact use case and you decide to leave the game because they are not exactly what you wanted to a t??  My god your life will be difficult if thats the kind of reaction you are going to anyone trying to do something for you...  
---
Please FUCK OFF!
---
it's r/expectedskyrim at this point on reddit.
---
Pokemon Go has a similarly negative community due to Niantic's complete ineptitude when it comes to connecting with their player base and knowing what that player base wants.
---
anet now depends solely on the dudes who think it's somehow virtuous to gratefully accept what one is given regardless of circumstance, and then let other people know that they, at least, have learned to be satisfied with their crumbs
---
2 years, they developed this for 2 years.
---
Eh .. you can go double shortbow condi ranger with Quickdraw. That might not be the bestest but it is good enough for DPS.
---
Just put two keys in the keybindings and use your keyboard software to have a macro key that presses both...
---
Once in a lifetime I have to agree with hinawerden. Without changing the game fundamantaly, his/her solution would achieve the Same as a newly implimentet optional sub.
---
To much work for little gain. For both sides (company and customer)
---
Probably the Broken Wall for nostalgia reasons. Did it in Beta with a friend and had a ton of fun. We took like 2 hours because we couldn't figure out the right way (and didn't know of dodgejumps or swiftness to jump further...).
---
Not as good as necro especially with Signet of Agony
---
Chalice of Tears, as that was the only challenging one
---
Weyandt's Revenge!! It was one of my first jumping puzzles and I'm super fond of it. I love the theme, Weyandt is a goof and the little riddle at the end is a nice touch as well. Also generally no hard/crazy jumps that punish you for failure.
---
Second favourite would be the clock tower. :')
---
takes more than one but yeah there's plenty of people like him that enable anti consumer behaviors. he's one of many
---
Exactly what I've done. It still isn't great, the system has flaws and I'd like more slots at a cheaper price but linking things is a minor concern when you can place a build on numpad 1 and its associated gear on ctrl numpad 1.
---
It's the one aspect in which the Anet solution is better than Arc was.
---
And at the end, that was just a dream.
---
Anet prove one more time, that doesn't care about anyone or anything.
---
They are doing what they think the best for fast income , ignoring the player base and their problems.
---
they are remind me some smartphone makers that has to do with fruits, where they end up selling the fun to the funboys. The main problem here is that the smartphone boys have a shiny new thingy, where we don't have anything else but a clunky and buggy system, called b2p....
---
Edit:
---
Sry for poor English. Not my native lang..
---
Honestly environments are the easiest part of development. I say lack of talent because the basics, the gameplay has always fallen short. For a video game, thats a cardinal sin. You can have the most beautiful environment ever, if theres nothing worthwhile to do in it, its meaningless. Lets be fair, Im not calling out the entire team, im sure there are some folks trying, but when you have results like we have seen, something isnt working. It isnt communication, and it isnt management, at a base level things arent going well
---
I am OP, and this is not what i want. Did you even read my post?
---
[deleted]
---
Could you make diagrams with descriptions please? There is no indication as  to what the percentage actually means - people who completed all achievements, the associated mastery points? It's also misleading if some achievements are not meant for everyone but only for some hardcore AP enthusiasts if in other episodes all are necessary for, say, legendary trinkets or simply for story progression.
---
An example for incomplete diagrams. ^^
---
So let me get this right...someone posts a screenshot of a bunch of text on a text document...and you all believe that it's code for the game?
---
ThinkingEmoji
---
At this point I'm pretty sure Anet is sinking their game because they don't want to work on it.
---
They wanted to make other games and NCSoft shut them down. Now they're teaching NCSoft a lesson by sabotaging themselves so hard that NCSoft will say "fine, make something new."
---
I dunno, there are software development methodologies which are centered around delivering added value as soon as possible, and then iterating on those additions after the user community starts interfacing with the software.  It's essentially the whole point of agile development.  We know that this stuff was incrementally working its way into the codebase for over a year and we even started seeing some of the changes many, many months ago.  They slowly started adding features to the game and continued to expand on it.
---
Thats cosmetics, not the actual feature of gliding, like the dude's list implies
---
1. I pointed out games like God of War and Horizon: Zero Dawn - many modern games are good, but the overall trend in the gaming industry is... well, my post.
---
2. I already avoid them, and this point is a little irrelevant, since what celebrities do has no impact on the quality of a game
---
3. Similar point - popularity shouldn't have anything to do with a game's quality
---
&gt; Or free or buy the expansions. It's simple as that  and it's only 20 bucks. 
---
Already free, thats the point of the post. Answer already been given. Maybe read the complete post next time, anyways thanks for trying.
---
Read through a bunch of these... I'm currently a developer but was previously in QA... Reading this I would say that I would want to work there as a Developer but not as QA. They seem to treat devs pretty good, especially for gaming industry (someone was complaining about it being too casual? weirdo).... QA in games is notoriously terrible so it doesn't surprise me that QA people are unhappy, that's kind of a thing (wonder why games are so bug ridden lol)... 
---
Also as someone who has read through glass door reviews quite a bit when deciding whether to work for a company, do you realize how often people go onto glass door to bitch about management? It's ubiquitous. If you didn't work at a company because of bad leadership reviews on Glass Door,  you'd be  unemployed. In fact, as a general rule I tend to think management is pretty crappy overall. I have gripes at nearly every company I've ever worked with about management in some form or another. I think that's partially me but I also think it's really not as easy to find good managers as you might think. My current manager is great. But 1.5 years ago I wrote a review on glass door about how terrible the managers are are the same place &lt;shrug&gt; The culture seems good at arena net, the conditions seem good, they don't force overtime. May pay not great for industry standards in the area (that's normal for game devs), but it also sounds like they care about their employees more than the average place. I don't see a problem.
---
Such aim is indeed healthy for the game. Inflation is a bitch that ruined many games. There are sinks for wealth definitely designed to fight this.
---
However this whole feature isn't even that expensive, if you take in account people who you talk about - those people do spend thousands on infusions, few hundred gold for templates are pocket money.
---
It’s not even a product, it’s a bunch of bullshit that should have been implemented a long time ago as part of the game, and it should have been done right 🙄
---
Huh, we leaked into another subreddit again.
---
Yes, thanks, i knew that. Im specifically looking for a cheap key to the paid base game to get rid of the Free-Version restrictions.
---
I've wanted to be a bird person since GW1. I want to be a ninja birb!!!
---
That may be direct criticism, but it can be mostly summarized as:
---
1. I want more build templates.
---
2. I should get more build templates for free.
---
I think that both can be conveyed pretty well in a meme format - honestly, I expected more from that wall of text.
---
I rate 3/24 (3 more at the gemstore)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Androel
---
Sorry if I wasn't clear, someone posted his dialog on Tumblr but he's an official in-game NPC. :)
---
&gt; next expansion
---
lol.
---
Hold on, so because you will now have to spend an extra second changing your gear and build every couple hours, you decided to quit and go back to paying for the game that has so little respect for your time it might as well be a negative value?
---
You mean that one reddit thread in december? of 2017/2018 after which there wasn't any substantial report on subreddit or any of the discord raid communities of gear being "eaten"? 
---
Also in that very same thread you have [delta's response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/92s8m1/psa_arcdps_build_template_seems_to_have_eaten_2/e38dj8i/)
---
Just ask in mapchat. There are some guilds doing pvp on a regular basis. Tbh pure pvp guilds or better guilds won't recruit you in gold. They are mostly in plat+. But as i said just ask in mapchat and you'll probably find something suitable for you.
---
Woops, my bad.
---
So yeah, after reading the dialogue... it's like I said. They're more about the soul. 
---
Well, technically, this does happen in real life, too. Like when you're friends with someone for so long and you get along really well, you eventually start to consider them family despite them not being real family.
---
Like children that grew up without a father and when older they befriend an older person that they grow to view as a father figure, you know? That's the way I interpret that Sylvari. They share a deep bond with people they view as siblings and parents. 
---
In this case a parent would be more of a guidance counselor, someone that's wiser and can guide you like a parent would.
---
During FotFW, I saw someone moaning in map chat because they had to kill veterans for an achievement, and they were too difficult to solo. This playerbase is a joke
---
Tied in the sense they require them, sure, but then you could make the argument that living story is "tied" to expansions which isn't the argument anyone is using. The raids weren't developed to be included with the expansions, they were developed with the living story, so were funded off of microtransactions, not expansion sales.
---
fair enough but to back track a bit: does the pale tree need to harvest resources from other plants to make sylvari? no, she's a magical tree and as a tree she's perfectly capable to grow these materials herself (and if we're talking practicability it'd make the most sense to just grow these materials inside of the pods, preasembled into a sylvari, like an embryo) so she has no need to harvest these resources from other trees and given her "be one with nature" thing she teaches it'd be perfectly understandable that she wouldn't as to not disturb the other trees too much while on the other hand mordremoth doesn't give a shit about hurting his environment so he'd do it out of cynical efficiency.
---
and that's what i meant keeping it's sinister aspect (thinking about it it's probably more accurate to call it predatory towards other plants rather then parasitic) that she'd use a less efficient methodes that put o strain on her environment rather then just using the same methodes on a smaller but more sustainable scale.
---
I promise I was not being sarcastic! I felt you deserved to know your efforts have been noted and appreciated. I know from experience what it is like to try to make this kind of point in the midst a full blown argument like this one, and positive feedback often gets lost. 
---
So just wanted to let you know you did have an impact, albeit small. Also, you did make me write on reddit first time so bonus points for that! ;)
---
I like Weyandt's Revenge too because I didn't know it was a JP, I just stumbled onto it while trying to get a Vista in Lion's Arch.  It led my 1st character into its depths and, well, you know the rest ;)
---
I did actually use some of the Pirate weapons I bought from his 1st Mate though, as I was around LV 42 at the time and the GS was an upgrade lol.
---
No problem at all &lt;3 And thank you for the $$$

We aren't allowed to use Arc DPS, huh?
---
Wow. What garbage.
---
The way ANet monetizes convenience - and how whales put up with it - really surprises me.
---
I regret whaling for this game as long as I did.
---
Ok, I'll write a support ticket so they finally get to it. I think their network engineers are currently all busy with designing new gemstore upgrades, it's time to tell them to get back to work and repair the server connection things.
---
Yes that are excuses what they use. However they are not valid. It's their code, their developers if it takes too long for something that is simple enough to be done with a 3rd party tool then it's just laughable they can't do it.
---
Uhm yeah that stupid argument is here over and over. And it's just pointless. That's not how a relationship between the player base and ANet should work. 
---
Btw, to the middle part: I felt like that at the time of GW1, it was more than perfect.
---
Developers involved with Guild Wars 1 very, very explicitly stated that the level of burn out combined with the severe diminishing returns on sales meant that by the time Nightfall had come out the game and the studio were on the path to having to be shut down.
---
Traits &amp; skills were automatically changed, but not gear indeed for WvW; in PvP you would get the amulets, rune &amp; sigils set up, you need to change the weapons
---
"How to farm efficiently Silverwates Shovel ?"
---
&gt;And I dont know about you but I sure as hell dont want to lose our best dps meter plugin.
---
Inb4 ANet decides to implement their own dps meter. Two persons tracked for free, with 5 additional extension slots sold per character, 400 gems each.
---
All Im seeing is that the majority does meta achievements only if the reward forces them.
---
You're seeing a subreddit filled with the death-rattles of a passionate community. I don't know what else you're expecting. The thousands of hours and days spent playing this game are starting to become meaningless, and people are slowly coming to this realisation.
---
It just feels like a very fun, theatrical experience that was so awesome when I was a wee newb all those years ago. And some of those pirate skins are sweet!! I love the long bow and the shield particularly
---
Is there any way people can benefit from it too? If I dig up chests, can other open them as well?? I’d feel bad trying it out on my own if others can also take advantage of it...
---
I like you. 
---
I haven't really played Bound by Blood, only about 2 hours of it, and I am seriously just bored as hell of doing story and achievements in a new map each friggin' time. 90% of the released stuff is in the gem store anyways... I didn't even know it was that little stuff in that mini-episode.
---
If a company makes bad decisions, then they lose customers. Plain and simple. This is how bad businesses die and good businesses gain new market share. If GW2 doesn’t want to fix it’s shit, more players leave and the game suffers into obscurity as it rightly should.
---
dont use it then
---
Hello. 
---
You are not giving ANet money when you donate. 
---
In fact you are increasing what Anet pay out in donations as they double whats been donated.
---
If Anet had that much foresight, we wouldn't be where we are.
---
Well it is not like the videogame market is massive and almost oversaturated, and you can't find thousand of examples and ideas of what may and may not work, especially if you care so much about making good games in the first place.
---
Nobody starts a pro and everyone should have a chance to grow up, but when there are multiple studios that have been offering absolutely amazing releases, "WE DID OUR BEST GUYZ :(" does not cut it anymore, if it ever did
---
But at least we have builds template
---
Oh I know, but I know a lot of people would probably upgrade their temaplte right now if they thought the money was going elsewhere.  I know the current Extra life stuff doesn't beenfit ANET
---
I agree, I was just suggesting this as a way to smooth over some anger and do a little good.
---
lol, I'm far from being a "whale".
---
I’ve never seen a group of people so willing to shill for a corporation that doesn’t care about them and keeps trying to milk them of their money as I see in this sub. It’s like people around here think ANET is their close friend or something.
---
There is no issue. They mentioned on Guild chat they're looking into it.
---
A counterpoint being that bad publicity is exactly what needs to happen to hopefully jerk Anet out of their current downspiral. The game was already bleeding players before this fiasco, and the company’s blatant detachment from their loyal playerbase has done nothing but further deepen that wound. 
---
I have been faithful to Anet because GW means a lot to me, but at this point I fully feel that they deserve this backlash. If the players remain silent in the face of a company that clearly doesn’t understand (or simply isn’t willing to do) what their clients want and need, then they won’t change. Bad PR lights a fire under their ass to hopefully make them realise that they need to change or this game will end up in maintenance mode sooner than it should.
---
GW is an amazing game, but for the last year or two, Anet has been absolutely directionless and clearly treading water when it comes to actually keeping their game alive.
---
Most players, like me, just need a sliver of something good to keep us in, but for a couple months I truly don’t even want to log in, and bad patch after bad patch just feels we’re slowly going in reverse instead of forward.
---
Or use a radial mount menu.... That needs only 1 key. Lel
---
Your three main options for those classes are heal Scrapper (Engi), heal Tempest (Ele), and heal Scourge (Necro). None of them are "meta" healers per-say, but Scourge and Tempest are both good enough that you can easily be an effective healer if you know what you're doing (probably the same with Scrapper, but I can't say for sure since I've never actually played it, nor have I played with one recently). 
---
Heal Scourge is by far the best "carry" class in the game. What I mean by that is that due to the high barrier output, moderate healing, and insane resurrection that it provudes, a good heal scourge can easily carry a group of mediocre players through most raid encounters. That said, it's by far the hardest heal class to play and requires in-depth knowledge of the encounters you're doing, as its primarily healing is proactive damage mitigation with barriers. Furthermore, unless you're playing Harriers scourge, you won't be providing the offensive boons people usually expect from healers.
---
Heal Tempest is probably the closest healer to Druid in the game right now. The scepter (or dagger)/warhoen build can keep up perma 25 might, fury, protection, and regen while also having solid healing. Heal Tempest does require you to know the class/combos pretty well, and you'll be following a rotation based on what boons you need to provide, but once you learn how the rotation works it's a fairly easy class.
---
If you're just doing T4 fractals and below, I'd say heal Tempest is probably the best way to go. In CM fractals, none of these healers are good, as Fire Brigade is usually what's used. For raids, both Scourge and Tempest are good, but if you're not an experienced raider I'd definite suggest going with Tempest.
---
wait, is deciding to spend money supporting a game you enjoy really such a novel concept?
---
Yeah well I assume if course they love the game as we do and are willing to change something if they don't need the shop that much anymore. Your point is completely logical.
---
Thanks I will let a net know
---
You get it, sadly most people who scream about how OP chrono was and that chrono mains are just salty it got nerfed... don't. Maybe because they never touched the class. Who knows. Doesn't matter anymore anyways.
---
Nice!Happy haloween to you as well 🙂
---
I don't think I've completed any of those grindy useless achievements
---
Gotta get there soon then. Thank you. =)
---
With just about every non-casual player having gw2efficiency account (yeah even these days). You can extrapolate that there is huge reduction in above casual playerbase.

&gt; During the past few days, our engineers have been working on the Guild Wars 2 servers to address some of the challenges that Tuesday’s release brought to light. This engineering work may impact players’ experience and cause a variety of connection-related issues. This includes being unable to connect to the game, being disconnected from the game, or not being able to connect to in-game instances. If this happens to you, we suggest that you wait a bit and try again. You may also want to try restarting your game client. We apologize for the disruptions while we try to restore a stable in-game experience for all.

Heal: If you placed a shade and you are not in it are actual. I usually try to avoid placing one since 10 target ez barrier around me. It's only aids at Matthias when I try to help people doing mechanics.
---
Condi: Haven't played much in raids, only open world. Actually only did Gorse and Sabetha as kiter yet. What I can say from Sabetha is that cleansing burn is annoying.
---
Anet:
---
&gt;Yep it's broken, but since it's pvp we don't care and will ship this trainwreck anyways! Enjoy! o/
---
I mean, you may jest, but I personally think increasing the maximum to 8 each and increasing the default number unlocked by 1 each would go a long way towards improving things. I believe they ran into UI issues when trying to go above the current 6, but I can't recall a specific source for that.
---
You'll get more value out of Firebrand or Renegade than any of the classes that you've mentioned.  Things like h.Scourge or h.Tempest are nice to carry shit pugs in Fractals like Twilight Oasis or Siren's Reef, but the truth is that Firebrigade offers far more valuable utility and are a far more optimal pairing because Firebrand &amp; Renegade are all about active defense. 
---
* Is that jerk about to shockwave your group? You can give them stability or aegis. 
---
* Are your allies about to get condi-bombed by Reaper Amala? You can use F3 (4) or F2 (5) + (2)
---
* Are you worried about projectile damage?  You can use F3 (3) or Wall of Reflection.  
---
* Do you need more damage-boost? Perfect Inscription is a big-time DPS boost for burst phases!
---
* Renegade can provide an extra buffer of stability, resistance or projectile-hate with Alacrity.  
---
The truth is that unless you're in desperate need to hard-carry h.Tempest &amp; h.Scourge are overkill.  Firebrand has one of the most potent "pre-stacks" in the game; whereas all h.Tempest can do is stack Might/Fury and Scourge looks pretty.

I completely agree.

When i go to PVP i need to alt+2 or alt +3 to load a gear template with the weapons i want, and ctrl+ 6 to load my last template. 
---
Then i have to load my PVP build from account bank (i have more than 6 builds in bank, so slot 6 is shared.
---
This gives me a confirmaron box...
---
1- click hero panel
---
(1.2- click equipment)
---
(1.3- select the correct tab)
---
2- click build panel
---
3- select desired build Tab
---
4- pick build from bank 
---
5- confirm overwrite
---
So for me it's 5 clicks and alt + 2 or 7 clicks.
---
This is completely unacceptable from anet, and now i have to roll a PVP character... After spending 3.3k gems on my character (and i play mostly one, imagine paying 6k, or 9k+ if you use several heros...
---
Yeah I understand that, but your comment I replied to comes across as passive aggressive to me. If you didn't intend it, my bad.
---
The only nerf to heal scourge caused by the rework was that you now don't place sand shades unless your group is stationary for 20+ seconds. This means that if one of your team mates is out of place (say, they got teleported or something), you can't throw a shade on them to give them barrier. The biggest buff from the rework is that now your shade skills all hit 10 targets, so they're much more consistent at mitigating mechanics like VG greens and Sloth fear.
---
You are right about the negativity except for the part that if GW2 collapses it will be because of negativity of the player base. 
---
What you are seeing is that negativity of the player base is a catalyst in the chemical sense of the word, it increases the rate or the likelihood of the collapse. But if the collapse were not underway it wouldn't have a noticeable effect. 
---
If you light a match (catalyst, negativity of the player base) in a room with hydrogen gas and oxygen gas (content droughts or poorly thought out decisions on behalf of Anet), BOOM (GW2 collapse) and most of the hydrogen and oxygen will combine to create water molecules (tears of players due to GW2 collapse, mostly my tears). 
---
Light the same match (catalyst, negativity of the player base) in a room with no hydrogen gas and no oxygen gas (no content droughts or poorly thought out decisions on behalf of Anet) and not much happens, certainly no explosion (GW2 collapse), no tears I mean water molecules.  
---
Anet stops screwing around, there WILL still be negativity from players (people love to complain) but that negativity will not have the same impact it has now, which you pointed out: players leaving, potential new players not trying GW2, etc.
---
I feel your pain and I love the game.
---
And what do you mean remaining player base will be devastated? GW2 is life dude! I'm going to be suicidal, take a hostage, eat healthy, exercise or something worse! No Teq? No Dragon Stand? I can't even think about it. No ley line anomaly? How am I supposed to get mystic coins then?  How am I going to do my dailies? Pact Supply runs?
---
Cant wait for the eu day
---
What is that "engineering work" they're talking about and where can I see proof of its existence? Cuz' from my point of view, it doesn't look like it. How could it, when the only thing you introduce is a template feature, yet your entire servers break down?
---
no, the pw is same but sms authentication kicked in for some reason
---
Won't be anyone around to buy it soon
---
yeah , i dont know wtf is this, i'd like it to at least check my email when being authenticated or something
---
That’s 100% what it should happen. As someone pointed out Chris Cleary, made it a point to have the Delta guys incorporate limitations to the ArcTemplate, to avoid  people getting an unfair advantage. Suddenly EAnet makes the templates themselves and it’s all fair game.
---
Horizontal progression can be really cool and fun. For instance gw1 skill hunting or a lot of the metroidvania progression systems you get in some single player and indie games.
---
Looking forward for the EU train, got the expansions recently and it's kind of overwhelming
---
Boo, get better jokes
---
&gt;our engineers have been working on the Guild Wars 2 servers to address some of the challenges that Tuesday’s release brought to light

&gt;our *engineers*
---
Plural?  So there are two instead of one?  I incorrectly assumed they only had only one part-time code monkey to monitor things.
---
I don't think Whataboutism is leading us anywhere. And again: The "go ahead" argument is pointless, maybe even stupid. 
---
And yeah, I heavily doubt their love. It was present once. For a very long time since the releases of the two games. Now it is definitely gone.

I thought yellow is neutral, I don't remember seeing orange much but red is hostile.

---
TIL that only people who are toxic stop playing a game
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Anet have made more money off the gemstore than if they would have done a subscription.
---
Except the tax breaks they get for making those donations make back that money and then some.
---
Gotta love the passive tense, there: 'challenges that Tuesday's release brought to light'.  It wasn't our fault, guys, someone else made the problem and we just found it!
---
Well, i do use an equipment template with more than one build, and one build with more than one gear loadout.
---
Example:
---
Dragonhunter, fractal quickbrand &gt; berserker scholar
---
Raid pi dh, raid quickbrand &gt; berserker thief (i manually swap the rings for this)
---
Harrier gear &gt; fractal healer, raid healer
---
Minstrel gear &gt; fractal healer, raid tank, WvW healer
---
How does anet feel about this? This is directly taking away a function they’ve added in the gem store and I anticipate anet not liking this and banning people for it.
---
No. I’m not asking for more slots - I’m asking for a system that actually works and isn’t a pain to use. Heck, a developer managed to make a 3rd party add on that did this better than they managed to do.
---
I would love to see your rendition of the Metal Legion artwork.
---
Because from what we know, they broke every engineering assumption the inventory and equipment systems had in place, without doing massive amounts of QA and software testing to ensure their changes would not cause breakages.
---
Purple? Think there is nothing that you could confuse with it. Ok, it would be hard to see the title if you are in front of a branded area but IMO that would only be a problem in some areas (and I guess we won't get to see many more branded areas in the future).
---
Most of us do. What I expected was to go to the build tab and select which gear template to use.
---
this is a great non response, i love it
---
tfw build templates are literally killing the game.
---
Sorry, I didn't mention I was referring solely to Fractals (I don't raid), where 10 targets is irrelevant.
---
If you want the safe way , where you dont risk getting a stolen key , or someone taking your account just but the PoF expansion its 20$ and it unlocks everything in the game , you will not need to pay a cent after , and think about it this way , if she ends up liking the game she will want yo buy the expansion sooner or later as core Tyria dosnt nearly offer as much . So you will be saving money by just buying the expansion.
---
In that case they might as well start banning people for having notepad open, because this plugin hardly differs much from notepad in functionality.
---
r/whoosh
---
While I agree, I'm just trying to say that they might drive up the donations by adding template add-ons
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
This event is so good for the community. I did it last month and it was great.
---
Your anger/frustration seems incredibly misplaced.  Instead of being angry at "whales" or anybody just spending their money on a game that they like (or used to like), perhaps you should focus more on the poor decisions Anet has made?  People are allowed to spend their money on whatever they want, so don't get all bent out of shape when they do.  It's really not their fault that Anet has slowly shifted to this microtransaction blunder over the years, that's all purely on Anet and their goal to make more money over making more customers happy.
---
IMO, Anet seems to have become extremely short-sighted, not considering the long-term effects their decisions will make... which is why they don't seem to be doing so well right now.
---
I never understood the anglosphere's reaction to comparision, calling it whataboutism. It's also called context. Everyone can decide an arbitrary ideal and criticise how it's not being achieved. Arguing within the confines of the reality of the world however is a vastly different beast.
---
Anyway, seems like you made up your mind.
---
Perfection
---
Anet will probably never give you an official answer beyond exactly what they gave when they responded to the "ban wave" of "people using hacked templates."  I.E.  Use at your own risk, we will not endorse this add-on, and if it directly violates the ToS we will ban for it.
---
So, regarding the 'Power Minion' build for the Necromancer (on core, I don't have the expansions as of yet \[oh hell I will\]), why stick with dagger/warhorn? Is staffs for this build not as optimal? I don't absolutely need the most OP build, just as long as it's relatively effective. I was hoping it's still relatively viable since uhh, to be honest the staff is a lot cooler with the scythe effect, as well as me being more comfortable with (predominantly) ranged combat. From what I can gather, it just stacks my 'death shroud mode' a tad slower but that's definitely a trade-off I'm willing to have.
---
I work a charity auction every year and I can defiantely say that if you want to raise more money get better stuff to put up for auction.  It's unfortunately how it is and if they put the template upgrade stuff up for charity then the charity would make more money, period.
---
The optimal heal scourge build for fractals would be Harriers, since the healer needs to be keeping up perma might. But honestly I don't hear of many people playing scourge at all, exactly because of its low boon output. If your team isn't stacking though, keeping up perma might would be insanely difficult.
---
Since I don't know your exact build or how you play, I can't really give much more info on how you might mitigate the rework nerfs. But for your purposes, heal scourge may be a bit of a lost cause.
---
&gt; It's really not their fault that Anet has slowly shifted to this microtransaction blunder over the years. 
---
yes it is, if they didn't pay into it then anet wouldn't have continued down that path cause it wouldn't be profitable
---
&gt;  That's all purely on Anet and their goal to make more money over making more customers happy... they've "sold themselves out" if you will
---
and who's giving them the money?
---
I know what whataboutism is, and it is a legitimate concern. I just think the anglosphere's infatuation with it (never found it being used that massively to stifle discourse as overwhelmingly as there) is counter-productive and way over the top. Every kind of parallel one is drawing, every comparision, all context - whataboutism!
---
"Why is this ball red!"  
---
"Well, the entire room is red. Is it's theme."  
---
"I haven't been talking about the room, I've been talking about the ball! Stop your whataboutism!"
---
It's bizarre.
---
Anyway. Have a nice evening, depending on your time zone. :)
---
&gt;At this point I'm not sure if it's even greed. I think its desperation.
---
It honestly seems like this is partially it.
---
If you just want to go with "But they are greedy and just need money from the cash shop" then you're far better off calling other MMO's greedy.
---
WoW releasing the store mounts with subscription incentives. While yes it's an incentive and bonus it can look greedy.
---
FFXIV and the fact it literally removes all old event items to sell it back to you the next year instead of keeping them around to earn when the event comes back is greedy.
---
Anet is on a whole different level. Yeah they can look greedy because obviously they want to make money, but half the shit they seem to put out looks like desperation and just throwing darts to see what sticks makes sense.
---
delusional apologists always go back to the old saying "you is t0xic!". Get a grip and face reality.
---
I'm probably gonna catch flack, but I've been evacuated from Sonoma County and haven't had a chance to check. But has anyone tried deleting the .dat file to get past all the bugs?
---

---
of course
---
I am not gonna discuss word meanings with spit from a turkey.
---
Huh? Are you serious? Did I say that I want to play alone the whole time? 
---
No. But seriously, for the starter maps I honestly don't care how many people are there. 
---
And I bet you'll find MANY people that appreciate you can discover GW2 on your own without the need of others always helping you.
---
That's why I said veterans who use gw2efficiency specifically, but yes you are not wrong.
---
A free heroic booster or free fireworks or a box o' fun :)))))))))))
---
May I request a copy of the templates used in your screenshots?
---
Uninformed? So would you have rather I just say whats already been said? I'm just not going to sit and bitch a Anet anymore. They aren't a horrible company they just don't have the staff too make huge changes to any one single area because the game is so large. 
---
Which is why I was just hoping to give them some ideas that are cheaper than creating an entire new map. 
---
Maybe one day you'll mature enough to not react like a douche bag to people who only want the game to get better. L8r.
---
https://i.imgur.com/y7Hm9.jpg
---
Oh wow they really broke it for ye folks. At least PvE and WvW got junk that works to a point. I dont see why they felt they had to release something that, apart from being broken, is not even a complete working feature.
---
As somebody that happily spent money on gems multiple time ,as a thank you for the free episodes, i call bullshit on that.
---
It's the complete lack of care and awareness that is getting extremely infuriating
---
I'm talking about the level number, not the whole NPC name.  The level number of the NPC changes colour based on their relation to your own level, from grey (much lower than you) to purple (much higher than you).
---
You're right that for the name, green is friendly, yellow is neutral and red is hostile, while white is ambient creatures that die in one hit unless they're Ebonhawke chickens, which immigrated from Hyrule.
---
What? The ban wave was for people cheating in PvP. Had literally nothing to do with Templates.
---
not at all. :D
---
Considering the intense and salty reactions in this thread, I wonder how these players would deal with a game like Fallout 76 *which is in a considerably WORSE state* lol
---
Does this mean basically that you have to \*make\* your teammates know they need to stay pinned to put the barrier on them? I can't imagine how difficult this is when moving around a fractal or raid rooms.
---
Even if you make healer scourge for some fights. Healbrand and Druid(for raids) are still more common. Ele can be an off healer tempest similar to scourge, but you’d get more groups wanting a Weaver/dps class.
---
Looks and feels great! Thank you for creating it. :)
---
By the six!
---
Well yeah at this point in the game converting to sub only would be a mess which is why a premium sub should be added to so they start working on more playable content instead of cash shop items. The freemiums can continue to support through the cash shop.
---
As for fallout that was supposed to be private servers not a subscription model but the dumped it on the community as a subscription which is why the uproar.
---
I agree with your last point and I feel they have gone too far into the bad for the quality to get better with a sub anyway.
---
They should have just copied the way arcdps did it. It incentivised people to go make legendary gear. With the new system legendary gear is beyond worthless.
---
I deal with Fallout 76 by essentially ignoring its existence. I love Guild Wars 2 too much to give it the same treatment.
---
Exactly my thoughts, so basically I have 3 "second class" healers/support. Maybe I'll check out the druid or firebrand and make one of those.
---
If you want to do ranged combat with a (core) Necromancer, consider Axe instead of Staff.  The range isn't as long, but you'll get more damage out of it.
---
With that said, Necromancer is one of the tankiest classes in the game, having the highest HP of any class (shared with Warriors) and a second HP bar via Death Shroud.  You shouldn't be worried about getting up close and personal with your opponents, and Dagger is the best choice for that.
---
A lot of new players to Guild Wars 2 gravitate towards ranged weapons because of the safety they can bring.  And yes, they are safer, but they also breed bad habits.  If you're just hanging back and shooting from a distance while your ranger pet or necromancer minions draw aggro, you're not learning how to survive, how to properly dodge, using various weapon and utility skills to evade or block or blind or do other such things for damage mitigation.  And that's fine while levelling in core Tyria, but eventually the expansions will come, you'll get dropped into Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire, and you'll wonder why you're dying so fast and how you're expected to survive, because suddenly you're not dealing enough damage with your weaker ranged weapons and even normal enemies are using truly threatening attacks on you that you need to actively mitigate/avoid.  If you play melee now, you'll be better prepared to adjust when you get to those harder expansions, and while there'll still definitely be a learning curve you'll adjust quicker.
---
The final thing to note on this is that you do, of course, have a weapon swap.  Even if you run the preferred Dagger/Warhorn setup for Necromancer, there's nothing stopping you from keeping Axe or Staff as your secondary weapon choice.  Some Champion tier enemies are just overpowering, and you want to have a ranged weapon option to deal with them.  That's fine.  But using the ranged weapon option against everything is suboptimal and breeds bad habits.
---
Had no issues on mobile or my desktop.
---
No, you see, you use singular when there's one.
---
You use plural when there's more than one, or none at all.
---
No. Many of them are woefully outdated anyway, because I've been slaving away as chrono for a year now.
---
This is the cheapest you will get which includes expansions. If you find anything cheaper you will be paying this on top of that to get the expansions anyway.
---
same. I know what my skills do, but if you want me to name them? Uh. Well. Good luck.
---
Ok ok got it :)
---
i stopped doing meta achievements after pof.
---
Maybe i'm just tired, maybe i didnt liked the achies enough to do them.. maybe the AP rewards are so bad i don't really want to invest time on them.. who knows.
---
Seriously, i need 150AP to reach 35k, i could grind like i did in the past near milestones, but... those 30 gold and a title............
---
Awesome work, thanks you so much
---
Sadly I'm spoken for ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
thank you
---
As someone who has played all healers somewhat, I would argue that to play heal scourge adequately isn’t particularly difficult, to really excel and hard carry is certainly more challenging. So it would work well to learn and as you get exp, you can start to show off a bit lol.
---
It was absurdist/dry humor. Like, let's say you had plans to go to the beach, and then a hurricane hit, but you said "No worries, I bet it'll clear up any minute and we can hit the beach by lunchtime!". You know better, but it's making light of a shitty situation. Granted, not easy to convey in text lol
---
rip acc value http://prntscr.com/pquc7o

its different to make plugin with scripts to change gear/skills and make user interface with same actions.
---
Thats sounds pretty compremised to me fam
---
I'm on the opposite side of this problem. Last month my friend and I came back to GW2 after taking a year off. We used to play a lot of ranked PvP and generally speaking we were in medium to high silver tier as far as our skill levels went. Neither one of us would say that we're great at PvP. We were just okay, and that's when we were in our "prime" if you could call it that.
---
Cut to last month, we decide to fire up GW2 again and run a few PvP rounds on our old builds to see how bad they'd become after (likely countless) balance changes since the last time we'd been on.
---
We won exactly half of our placements. 5 out of 10. After the 10th game (which we won by a hair) the system plunked us squarely in high gold.
---
What? Excuse me, what the deuce?
---
I'm sure you can guess how the rest of our matches turned out. We ran another 10 matches or so that night and I think we won exactly 1, just barely scraping by with a score something like 500-493. Every other match was a complete shut-out. I'm talking about neither one of us being able to 1v1 *anyone*.
---
We didn't want to be in gold. We both agreed that ***we are not gold tier players*** and we feel bad for anyone getting queued with us. We should have been in bronze, or silver at best.
---
So we figured we would take a break from PvP and just get caught up on PvE stuff for a while, let our ranks decay instead of uselessly bashing our faces against our keyboards. Of course that worked, right?
---
Wrong. We decayed to bronze and started queuing up again. But we noticed the same patterns as before. Just getting absolutely ***wrecked*** every single match. This time, we hadn't won a single one.
---
So the next two matches, I added everyone from the match to check their ranks after the fact. What did I find?
---
Gold and platinum tier players, every last one. In the second match ***everyone*** was a platinum player. We were both bronze.
---
We haven't played since (well, I haven't anyway... I'm not sure if he's tried again at all). The matchmaking and rank placement system is so totally FUBAR that there's literally zero point in us even trying. Clearly the game thinks that even though we've decayed to the lowest possible tier of bronze, we're platinum- and gold-tier quality players who should be facing off against the best of the best.
---
If any of you happened to get queued with us during our PvP attempts, I apologize, and I agree with your frustration and anger. I didn't deserve to be fighting alongside gold- or platinum-skill players. I am a shit player who should be mucking it out in bronze, but PvP placements won't let me. 
---
But don't worry, I won't be playing PvP again.
---
Sorry, every other Tuesday when their posts get enough votes to be relevant
---
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference. 
---
If I'm not mistaken, it's specifically a reference to DIO vs Jotaro Kujo.
---
Placement matches have an extremally volatile MMR.
---
Basically, a Silver player usually wins 14 ranked points for winning and lose around 11 when losing. In the middle of placements, your character gains around 100 for every victory and lose 100 for every defeat.
---
So you win a game (carried or not) and get throw to fight high golds, lose and you may already be fighting alongside silvers.
---
3 luck wins in a row you are already fighting Plats. Its pure chaos.
---
When you finish all placements than things change a little, as the game will only place you with people around your skill level as long there is enough people queuing.
---
TL:DR There is no point in complaining about strange games while doing placements.
---
Could you make a permalink to the download location (since it looks like the link on your website is named based on the release date)? I'd love to add this to the addon manager.

Are you just new to the internet in general or just Reddit?

They use this onomatopoeia a lot in the Jojo series.
---
My employer rolled out an update that broke the hiring system and caused a nearly 3 month freeze for new hires. Trust me I get it.
---
This is absolutly disgusting, how could you destroy thousands of hours of dev's work just to have a 3rd party library do it for you? This is absolutly outragious and you should be insta banned for posting such a thing. It hurts the Gw2 devs and they lose a lot of money because of you. I purchased max build templates on 10 characters to support anet and so should you. Otherwise this game will die. They need more money to afford the server costs.
---
Or you know, middle ground or perspective?
---
The build template system is bad, like *really bad*, I agree with this. But the game *also had* little to NO downtime or connection issues in 7 years of its existence whereas other games have sometime to shut down for almost half a day just to update the game.
---
I don't see who it benefits to call Anet 'clowns', or to tell them to 'fix their shit', or to doubt about the existence of QA testing or even engineers. That's productive to no-one, even less the atmosphere on this subreddit.
---
But be my guest if it's your cup of tea. You do you.
---
The only levitation casting animation that I'm aware of is staff Fire 5 on Elementalist. Overloading Water causes levitation on all races but they're actually suspended in water.
---
CMC has a good idea of the pain points of the community having been a a pvp player before working at anet. Like all these changes and I can’t wait for the changes he looks at in the future.
---
thanks! With which spells do they levitate while other races don't? 
---
I thought they jump and somersault but not levitate more? Like with that meteor shower, they could levitate but they don't so this made me think there are other spells where a human female levitates, but Asuras don't, but maybe I am mistaken and Asura do levitate more.
---
Assuming that you are new player starting at 1500 rating, winning 3 placements in a row neats you around 1800 due to placement volatile numbers.
---
1800 pretty much means that you are getting matched with Legendary players, I wouldn't expect anything less than being destroyed.
---
Because PvP in this game is good.
---
You missed "everything" in the quote and they've only tuned down 2 traits that have been an issue since they existed.
---
thanks! well a female Norn Guardian will levitate with that 4th staff spell!
---
I hope there are more spells like that in the game apart from Elementalist's (fire staff 5)?
---
Empower on an Asura guardian is the best looking levitation animation for me personally.
---
Water Overload levitate is cool to look at ! 
---
Most of overloads ''levitate'' on all races though, but Asura is interesting to look at.
---
Yeah that reminds me, rangers with axes is ridiculous, but axes in general just don't have that kind of 'combat' feel to it especially with seemingly "lighter combat". If I am to have an axe, it'd be a two-handed battle axe specifically used by tanker classes. It just doesn't fit the theme to me. But it's all good, I think I'll just stick with my ranger.
---
I love Guild Wars 2 a lot too but I fail to see how it is productive to pour salt in every threads and shout hyperboles left and right. I'd say it's more harmful than else. But that's just me.
---
I think a redirect works fine; I know I had deltaconnected make a symlink to the latest release for naming purposes and it worked fine.
---
yeah that's the one I was thrilled to discover with my female Norn! The 4th staff spell. So Asuras levitate too? Great :) Though I suspect they don't do it in that godly beyoncé way :)
---
Why in the world would you spend so much on one game ? Especially when you say you disagree with their monetisation practices ?
---
Correct to an infinite number of scenarios, even with the "correct" thought pattern things will be missed.  Because, when it comes to complicated operating systems OR games the number of possibilities end users can come up with is endless.  Which is why Microsoft and Guild Wars 2, have weekly patches.  No matter how a good QA team is things will be missed.
---
How much money is that then all together?
---
So the Total Makeover Kit is priced at 10 Black Lion Statuettes, is there any other kind of 'limit' as to the purchase? For instance is it available at all times? Does my character need a specific level requirement or something?
---
&gt; thanks! well a female Norn Guardian will levitate with that 4th staff spell!
---
Yeah, forgot about that one. I just did a quick edit before I saw your reply.
---
it is cool, I agree! However, this is not levitation, all races are just suspended in water.  But it looks great :)
---
I see what you did there.
---
It's just utterly ridiculous. I honestly thought it was going to be like WOW where you save a build and your gear all under one tab and click. But no. It's a mess of a system. It's absolutely worse than what we had before because NOW the auto loadout of builds if you popped into WvW doesn't happen anymore. What an utter mess.
---
i also love them for story purposes, can take your time and experience the story bits without others trying to rush you.
---
and its story NPC's with sometimes fun banter between them.
---
Female human reaper levitates a lot in gs2 animation, especially since with some prerequisites you can spam one gs2 after another.
---
But anyway, you can just create new characters and test their animations in pvp lobby.
---
i know how ESO works bc i have hundreds of hours on it as if it made your point in any way more clear or somehow undermined what ive been saying here. in fact its just a bit silly because its exactly what i was talking about. but pardon me for not writing an essay to prove the validity of an opinion, haha.
---
the material storage is a huge hindrance to not to have, and i dont see the point of buying the dlcs separately when something  so important  is something i cant use and i cant justify buying both dlcs &amp; the subscription... especially when it may end up more expensive to buy the dlcs. so i played it with a subscription. but i dont also have money to constantly buy the subscription, and due to lack of time and various other reasons, i couldnt "make the most" out of the subscription. and i havent got unlimited money either, so i had to cancel it.
---
so yes, you can play ESO and have fun if you dont care about crafting, i suppose. but if youre trying to claim that without material storage crafting is in any way accessible youre just lying or never tried crafting without a subscription because theres so many different materials. its a huge thing, one that i personally would call crucial. and the bonus +10% XP/inspiration/research time reduction is a thing. but as someone who likes to craft, not having the subscription does set you back for real... and then theres the benefits i enjoy, like dyeing costumes, etc.
---
whereas GW2 i can play on and off and not lose money via paying for a sub while i cant play-- what if i can only play one week from the month? and when i dont have subscription, i dont have the dlcs and i cant progress in  a meaningful way, but i know if i buy the subscription i can access the dlcs, so i dont want to waste money on the dlcs separately. and its a cheaper monthly rate if i buy more months, but i cant, because i dont know whether i can play or not, and i cant afford buying multiple months. so it charges more from people who can Maybe afford subscription. and thats what a subscription is supposed to do as well. because, its monetization.
---
ESO also doesnt allow me to buy crowns with ingame normal currency, so i would be forced to buy crowns, but why would i do that when the subscription that i cant afford always gives me crowns. ESO is designed to do this: to encourage you to subscribe. that is monetization. i dont understand how this is "more fair" than GW2 monetization model? ESO also has microtransactions and gambling in the form of the crown store and the crown crates. its not that much different, no?
---
as i said, i cant afford subscription. to me, GW2 works way better. and it works way better for a lot of people this way! if you think ESO has a better business model, then you can go play it. but dont mistake your personal opinion for an objective opinion. like the implication that you get enough cosmetics by just playing the game. well, maybe for you? but of course the ingame shop has better items to promote buying from it. you can make the same argument for GW2. have you tried not looking at GW2s ingame shop, duh?
---
so, for me, i can sometimes spend a little money to buy gems to increase the utility of my account or just buy a cool skin. thats the draw of GW2 for me. i dont have to subscribe! and thats the draw for a lot of people who cant afford subscription. because most MMOs require the subscription outright or heavily promote it because thats how they make their money. anyhow, they also added the benefits of ESO+ with exclusive items, something i just found out from [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/09/18/new-benefits-are-being-added-to-the-elder-scrolls-onlines-eso-plus-program/#19f6ea257486) since i havent been playing for a while.
---
so ESO monthly rate for 6 months is about 13 dollars (for one month, 16). so, imagine if a "casual" player can afford one ten dollar purchase per month? sometimes more? sometimes less? thats about the cost of a subscription.
---
its very laughable to imply that the small "hardcore" playerbase "carries" the rest of the community on its shoulders. are you implying the hardcore playerbase are the whales? it also amuses me that if hardcore players play so much and so well, why is gathering gold to buy the gems one needs so difficult if even i can gather gold when i can easily fit into the "casual" label despite spending countless hours on this game? it just seems a matter of principle to get to complain.
---
also if those "happy-feel-good-casuals" didnt exist, who would you be doing map metas with? your ten person raid group?..
---
and yes, i know gems arent generated out of thin air. i didnt say nobody should buy gems ever. i said if it bothers you to buy gems, you dont have to! because you can buy things with ingame currency. and gold-gem rate is dependent on what the players are doing, GW2 isnt mysteriously manipulating it like some claim.
---
anet isnt out to punish "hardcore" players.  like i said. its just doing monetization. and the monetization isnt that different from other MMOs... the matter of the so-called build templates is so dumb to me because arcdps never was that easy to use nor feasible to run on slower computers since sometimes you can only run one thing, and its the game itself.
---
most people only gained from this update. anet isnt "pandering" to "casuals". its a business trying to earn money. if it feels unfair to you, thats your opinion. but i really dont think its an objective opinion in the slightest. it just seems to me that people think theyre way more important to the game than they actually are or are the most-paying citizens when i doubt thats true.
---
anyhow, again, build templates arent crucial. they can still be shifted manually. gear can still be shifted manually. quality of life issue? definitely its more convenient to have build templates. if arcdps had never existed, everyone would be way more okay with this. once the bugs and server issues are out of the way, itll be fine. is it perfect? no. do i love monetization? no. will i buy a build template? i dunno! will i be buying other things? probably!
---
but yeah, my point being that a subscription would be taking away one of GW2s draws was hopefully clear
---
Not in the API yet, will come to gw2e when it is.
---
Yes. 
---
Most of these errors are happening due to issues with legendary gear, full inventories or cross game modes.
---
If none of these apply to you, just play normally.
---
Thanks for the input! I wanted to to create characters and test them but then I thought I'd have to level them all up to unlock the spells. So you suggest entering pvp immediately? How do I do that? I'll be horrible though. Or I could try the lvl 80 boost just for testing?
---
Just make a keybind like F1=build template 1 &amp; Ctrl F1= equipment template 1. So much melodrama.
---
Well, like [someone said in the clocktower thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dpcvzw/psa_do_not_play_with_use_equipment_templates/f5upn5i/), at least it shows that anet did a good job on the failsafes to ensure that template bugs don't delete your gear.
---
Oh you mean something well thought and polished?
---
Do not worry bro, anet will fix it by adding mode split, so you have 6 builds and gear loadouts per mode! And they will increase both limits to 10!!!
---
Then you will happily spend 3200 gems to max your character! It's not like you already spent 3300 gems already for a product so rushed (after 2 years of development) that (allegedly) eats infusions (which cannot be recovered by support probably) and as a side effect crashes whole maps right?
---
Well... I'm off to get 5x backpacks because my legendary can't play fashion wars anymore. Thank god i didnt craft legendary armor the announcement was 2 days early. Really dodged a bullet!
---
PS: i spent 3300 on my main and i'm probably spending at least 1100 more in my alt... Thank god i don't play more heros...
---
strongest core classes are warrior and guardian.
---
i dont know why you saw somewhere praise about core necro minionmancers, i wouldnt take that seriously
---
Which defeats the point of not using 3rd party programs, no?
---
If you have to use a 3rd party program to prevent the need of using other 3rd party programs, you're right where you started.
---
Yes it was tested, by the players.
---
Same with holosmith engineer.  I built one to run in fractals, first time i'd ever really played Engi and was enjoying it a lot.  It was never a top DPS rotation or anything, but they decided to nerf it into the ground.  I'm getting real tired of them nerfing and changing things so frequently and costing me gold to change all my ascneded gear again and again.
---
Let's not pretend that ArenaNet's programmers are high school freshmen
---
Nope, no restrictions, it's just a one-time use only thing though, so if you want to change your look again, you'll have to get another one
---
the colours are so lovely! the light works wonders, especially on the face and clothing. really cool!! and i do have a soft spot for sylvari necros
---
Yes, shame on them to be unable to reach the quality of service a non official source was able to provide.
---
Also, Arc DPS was officially authorized by ANet, so that's as close as you can get without being made by ANet.
---
Also your argument is wrong. If I want 90 builds I should pay ? Ok, but the game won't let me, because it's limited...
---
thanks! maybe it's the angle, but it does not really seem like the character goes much above the ground? Like with Empower (Guardian, staff, 4th spell) my female Norn levitates higher, but again, maybe it is just the the angle of the camera in this video and the height is the same.
---
I'm so bad at platforming I don't think I've completed a single jumping puzzle in my 1000 hour playtime... ;\_;
---
All healers have their strengths and weaknesses. But whenever I have a group in fraktals that is really incompetent, my heal engi carries them with ease. The downside is that you deal close to zero dps.
---
Making your plugin an .exe will definitely raise the paranoia levels about it through the roof
---
PVE condi scourge and the shades changes  say hi
---
Looks more like adding gasoline to a pyre imo
---
I think we're on the same page, then. I'm not happy with the situation either, but I'm not gonna wallow in the negativity surrounding it. There's not much I can add to the discussion so I'll leave it at that.
---
This post really belongs on /r/facepalm
---
GW2 is not a game where you play a "weapon type". Weapons are a set of skills you use which vary class to class. Want DPS? You will use these weapons. Need support? Then these weapons. Weapons are to be used for the situation you are in. If not you aren't going to enjoy GW2.
---
Interesting way to interpret that message. You're wrong, but even if I was only using 6 builds, that doesn't mean I wouldn't want to STORE all the builds I'm not actively using somewhere. That's the purpose of a STORAGE, wouldn't you say?
---
Why would they ban people for it? History shows us, with bgdm, they banned the creator/provider of the plugin, not its users
---
In particular we’re looking at:
---
Scourge
---
We’ve identified scourge as the major pain point in WvW right now, and more specifically Sand Savant’s big shade affecting 10 targets. This has pushed scourge far above other options in terms of damage, while also adding to its strong corrupts and solid barrier application. YOU LITERALY ADDED THIS SHIT INTO THE GAME IN LAST PATCH. champions of the inept and blind.
---
For fractals the dominant healer is firebrand, as he heals a lot while still providing very solid boons and a 100% quickness. Anything other than firebrand will have some issues finding a spot in fractals (I suppose heal renegade could, provided you can give 100% alacrity uptime).
---
For raids, if running 2 healers, you may find a slot as a secondary healer with any of the healing builds suggested by others, I personally like Heal Tempest.
---
Dare I dream of better times for PvP?
---
Any proof or stats or a source on that? Because tons of people just got banned the other week for non templates related issues.
---
Hey, I have same problem, how did you fix it ? :)
---
No, I stopped spending because I got fed up with the monetization strategies. While I was making purchases I saw it as supporting the developers for those who couldn't. 
---
As far as why I did it, it was mostly for the thrill/rush of shinies in all honesty. It was addicting and I justified it by saying it was supporting something I loved. I've gotten much better in the last few months as I've tried to protest with my wallet the direction they are going.
---
Apologies if I worded the original post poorly.
---
Well rampage is dead then(it needed nerfed but this got nuked) . 
---
At least warrior has some interesting elites like signet of rage lmao
---
You're not alone. my mind keeps thinking that people who are wearing this title, are in a party/squad with me, when they are not. lol
---
A thought I had (we'll never find out either way, but...)I think that there is actually a psychological reasoning behind this new title's "friendly" colour. Like, "Hey, if your "friends" have this title, you probably should too, right?"
---
&gt;Or all the toxicity and doomsaying of the "real fans" has scared off the casuals and people who play games to relax
---
Say whatever you want about "toxic" or "doomsaying". I don't give a shit.
---
But when developers abandon game modes like Fractal CMs, release only 1 raid per year, and barely give WvW the attention it deserves, we see real consequences to the health of this game. We see longtime players, guild leaders, content creators and their fans, all leave the game for WoW classic, FFXIV, etc..
---
Now before you say: "Oh hurrr durr hurrr that proves the point they're leaving just like casuals!",   allow me to paint a clear distinction: Longtime fans have been standing by this franchise for years. Fairweather casuals play GW2 for a few days and never again. One is obviously more important than the other.
---
That isn't to say GW2 shouldn't appease both players. But you don't release PoF and *snub* your most dedicated fanbase for 3+ years. That's what caused all the drama on reddit over the summer and the LS5 presentation.
---
Scourge is already useless in WvW roaming and you still want to nerf it? Do the devs even play their own game?
---
Mostly yes but that post is also almost 2 years old at this point and we haven't heard anything since other than "soon." Ideally they would add some guild related content since in GW1 Guilds could own outposts, but at this point just an update to the match-making system would be content enough for WvW vets tired of the imbalanced population coverage.
---
No, they've already said they plan a major shakeup to particularly competitive game modes, where they're going to tone down damage by players across the board as power creep has made people do too much damage/die too fast.  Things are going to be nerfed across the board to ensure that fights last longer than they currently do.
---
This is going to my home screen on my phone, fucki g amazing work!!
---
In their defense, it seems they are trying to fix it.
---
Roaming isn't the whole game.  I mean, this nerf is mainly reducing the target cap on Sand Savant, what roamer is fighting 6+ enemies as a Scourge right now to be affected by this?
---
The rampage nerf is bad, so you nuke the only elite that is useful? At least update signet of rage or something
---
No we can not. The mode is in maintenance mode because you dont spend enough gems in transfers. 
---
They even gave us a mount so we can buy skins for it!!!
---
Godamn they even gave us mount skill 4 (that doesnt work vs guards) so please buy more so they release a 2k gem one (i'll buy that)
---
Bottom line: we don't matter. WvW is as is and you should be grateful when our Eanet overlords acknolwdge we exist.
---
I’m ok with them nerfing the damage in favor of it being a utility weapon, tho I have to ask: 
---
Where the utility at brah?
---
A useless staff 4, a severely nerfed staff 5, nerfed staff 3 (1less clone). Sooo staff 2 being the only good thing staff does, qualifies it as a utility weapon?
---
Again, where the utility brah?
---
Also they forgot about Warrior 25 might all over the place and the now staple Bull’s Charge.
---
Devs are given, by management, a certain amount of time to fix bugs. They get a list of bugs from testers, prioritize them and try to fix the worst of them that they can get to within that time limit. If you think the devs make the release schedule, you're likely wrong.
---
There are also bugs that appear live that never appeared on the test server.
---
Explain to me the difference between a .dll and an .exe, because I feel like you have zero idea.
---
Spoiler: there is barely any difference in what they can accomplish.

---
Not coming back to GW2 until they fix it.
---
I know nevertheless the changes in that post are for pvp only.
---
maybe look at spvp if you want balance around small scale.

I mean, even Blizzard does this. They just have a PTR so that most of the really wonky, broken, and buggy things get ironed out by players who are essentially doing free QA testing. More and more devs seem to be going this route, with optional beta builds that people can jump into and give feedback on without it counting as a buggy release.
---
would like to know how many people actually play mesmer anymore... with all the nurfs seems like i rarely see any anymore.
---
Love it, the green light is awesome.
---
Post more of your art if you have any! :D

"Major shakeup"
---
This is excellent news and I'm greatly looking forward to it and future changes from these Devs.

Please just add an md5 for the latest version, would be appreciated greatly. I cannot handle redirects in my tool without extensive work that I don't have the motivation for, which would be rewriting a lot of it. Also I must ask, why do you use such a hacky way of determining the version? A user could change the file names and render functionality broken. Just look at the actual built-in version numbers.

Woah, it's a great compliment, thank you! :)

I used to work in Photoshop, but recently I fully transitioned to Clip Studio Paint.

They really need to make the unlocks account-wide, or at least add an additional option for account-wide unlocks that are more expensive than for a single character, but provide a vastly better bang-for-your-buck for people with more than 2 characters.
---
plot twist: they actually do, but it is for mobile

Skipping Stones is a lot of fun.

My case not realy any bug. Mut mess me arround.

Have queue in a thief. But seeing enemy comp decide to change to my guard. The problem was that relogging in guard takes some few time and whem get in, see the skils not realy the correct that i realy used. Chance utilitys and match started thats when i realised that game assumes build 1. That is the PvE build. And PvP was in build 2 but cant change to build 2, match have started.
---
Só end in a realy messi build using equipa and utilitys for my core burn guard build but build was realy at dh power build. Nota need to say that was end in a build realy messi that end in a no build for PvP. But até least make me realy understend where and what to look if im in the correcta build now.
