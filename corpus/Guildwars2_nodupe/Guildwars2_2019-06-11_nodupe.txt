Congrats :) enjoy the radiant back, one of what 100ppl able to choose/have one.

---
No, I get that. I'm just confused why you said mercy runes were a good replacement for monk runes if on a budget.
---
These are all great suggestions. They really could have made the skyscale a bat and saved the dragon design for an actual legendary mount.
---
Can you link me to that WvW alliance update?
---
I've found that with most pug T4's, harriers are actually overkill in healing and Magi's are better at running T4's faster
---
that sounds ridiculous; do whisper more sweet sweet lullabies.
---
Harrier's is actually overkill for raiding, too. 
---

---
You just want to get your Grace of the Land might duration to about 16-18 seconds, then the rest can be invested into other stats (such as Magi's for more healing and crit).
---
The only thing you'll be lacking a little is fury and other boons, but thankfully spirits also have very high base boon duration now, too. As do pets.
---
Metabattle is actually not that out-of-date! I think it's listed there under "Strength Dagger". Also, Metabattle links streamers who play the spec at the bottom of the page, and the streamers often list the builds they're using in their Twitch Description. Paul, for example, lists like 5 different Conquest Warrior builds in his iirc.
---
Being that the BLTC is literally an embedded browser in the game, I imagine this generic error message shows up when an error 500 occurs. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For obvious security reasons, you don't show anything on error 500's other than an error happened.
---
Most programs won't crash even if they have unhandled exceptions, and even in the off chance that they did completely crash the server there are safeguards to immediately start the server again (containers are really good at this)
---
Blame ArenaNet
---
I can't really help with the account thing but some advice on professiond/classes.
---
As person before me said, gw2 doesn't really have designated tanks outside of endgame raid content. So you must likely are better off playing dmg centered builds.
---
There is a lot of ways to play each class, so traits and gear are going to be important.
---
For the beginning you can look up "open world" builds on metabattle :)
---
Guard, Renegade(and the heart of thorns elite) are very handy to help with boons and some more survivability. Just play what is fun and maybe join a guild, usually the smaller ones care more for their members, have fun once you have your account back. And congrats on your bond.
---
Tempest D/W with bad condi removal? Don't know what people usually run, but Smoothering Auras + Powerful Aura says hello. I run it  for fractals, until now things have been great.
---
Metabattle is usually pretty up to date. [https://www.godsofpvp.net/](https://www.godsofpvp.net/) is even better when it's updated, but it usually doesn't get updates for a long time. Right now it's accurate because it was recently updated.
---
I want armored western dragon
---
I'm fine with anything honestly, but if ANet thinks I'm going to buy an Aurene skin they can get fucked.
---
In some Central Tyria maps, sourceless events like this could be the rift stabilizer events. However, this one is likely a poorly cleaned old event.
---
Or, it could be trying to point out something, like how there's that one NPC in DR who will change your personal waypoint location to the nearby pub. Say, are you sure that isn't location of the tree with the carved initials in it?
---
It was poorly received because it was badly done and they refused to listen to feedback.
---
Yeah, I can see how that is a drag. It can't be that bad though. Every night I see what appears to be decent numbers of players on WvW. The only way ANet will do anything is if a significant portion of all WvW stops. AKA people stop giving ANet cash for gems in WvW-related gem purchases. 
---
ANet does not care enough about WvW to rock the boat. They are doing nicely right now, obviously, and if they rock the boat it might hurt their bottom line. The only way out of this, the ONLY way out, is the literally impossible situation where a significant percentage of WvW players **stop playing**, and take to social media and shame ANet for being stubborn about this. But, that will never happen. There will never be enough players willing to stand up to ANet's inaction. So instead it is time for people to do whatever they can do within their power to resolve this problem. QUit WvW, quit GW2 entirely, or jump on the server-swap bandwagon and reward ANet for their bad behavior like so many other people are doing. You can not win this, so take care of your own mental health first.
---
I think I can agree with this. Even though for me personally 70g isn't much, I know for many people, especially for casuals, it is.
---
You clearly haven't played WvW in a long time.
---
My wife made me use minstrel's stats :(

to check if you have the griffon achievement started, just search for Open Skies in your achievement tab.

Holy crap, massive gratz and it looks amazing too. 39k ap is insane, I barely made 16k playing on and off all these years.

i wish vampirism existed in gw2 and you could become a vampire, like in ESO. same for lycanthropy

6k games and counting and still learning something new everyday, so dont worry, with practice you will get there eventually \^\_\^
---
 [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest) 
---
Here are some of the most common builds in PvP. Find one you like, learn it, change it to fit you. But above everything else, give it a quick read to what every else does. There are 9 classes, learning only 1 means that you are still missing 8/9 of the game's knowledge needed to do well in PvP. Play a lot, you will get a feeling of what to expect with experience.
---
My best advice though? Play what YOU find FUN. I find staff ele fun, so I have about 3k+ games on staff ele. Find you build(s) you enjoy and play them when you feel like it, everything else will come eventually.
---
you have two characters that are level 80 and have not completed the personal stories? im going to assume you grinded your way through to lvl80 to rush to "endgame", thus resulting in you being overwhelmed. Please finish all the stories. Every race and unique story decision has their own special story. You'll grow to appreciate the game more through understanding its lore as well. Ascended is really unnecessary unless you want to minmax for high level contents. And i think it takes awhile to get those. So dont worry about all those. You should think of your ~~Mastery and~~getting your Hero Points and understanding how to gear and spec your classes.

AP rewards system needs a revamp.

Oh I see!

Cheers for the reply, in depth and what I need to know.
---
When it says to upgrade your account, I have a choice from PoF, HoT or both for 50 USD, which I will be getting anyways.
---
On the next page it asks if I want the Ultimate or Deluxe version of PoF, I'm gonna grab the ultimate as well.
---
Cheers!
---
What level?
---
What Alvatore's saying is that a second side has sprung up with a similar banner to yours, abusing people under the cover of the moral high ground.  It's damaging.  Both because this sort of subgrouping diminishes your goals and it devalues the concept of equality to society as a whole.
---
The problem is that this group is pretty much being swept under the rug.  And while that works for a short-term gain what actually happens is that we now have a group with a moral imperative, a penchant for abusing others, and general social support.
---
I don't have to point out the occurrences in history where this has been a bad thing.
---
Anyway, I'm not sure what to do about it.  The problem with zealotry is that it's damnably difficult to break up, and sticking one's neck in that particular hornet's nest will get one stung.  As it stands, the safest way to deal with this group is to hang back and hope it's handled internally.  But it's not being handled internally.  And that's kind of  the problem.  If one group claims a moral imperative, yet does not police internally; their morals look far less like equality and far more like a standard.
---
Just thought I'd explain another view of things.
---
Permafrost for maximum over saturation
---
Agent of Entropy stops giving AP after x completions of it.
---
Well.. Go to the most recent boss ( /wiki et) and join a tag of possible. If there is no tag/the tag doesn't keep going on, try at the next boss.
---
Ooooor.. Spend 300g on your on tag (if you haven't already) and get it running by yourself ;)
---
That skin is part of the first mount adoption license, which has the biggest outrage thread of all time in this sub until Jessica Price took the mantle https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7bevvt/mount_adoption_licenses_are_an_outrage/?sort=confidence
---
After the outrage they decided to keep the current skin prices and to implement a "select" license that costs 3x more than the normal license, this select license was not applied to the original system because they felt it would be unfair with those who spent thousands of gems trying to get the skin they want. 
---
They are currently on rotation like nearly everything else in the store, but I remember the old math on them said you had to spend on average the equivalent of 16 or 17 licenses to get the one you want.
---
&gt;How did you get better?
---
Get back out there and keep losing. Eventually you'll be less useless, which is the first step to getting useful. 
---
Right now you're bad at everything, which is normal, and the only way to even begin to *try* to get better, is to play more. Nobody here can really help you with that until you find something specific you'd like to work on.
---
And time! I’ve got about an hour a night to grind a little. Last night I managed a whole 30 branded masses. Doesn’t feel much closer. 
---
But thanks :)
---
The cap for anyone who wasn't playing during LS1 is something like ~33,000 AP last time I checked.
---
They don't care. I haven't stepped foot in wvw or be that much active in game lately. Last time SoS was matched with BG and another server, BG and this server attacked us. Every other server that got up to t1 I feel as if they're being paid to get rid of us.
---
I don't know how we tanked for so long and those were the best bloody fights I ever got. 
---
But yes, people get sick of tanking and just want to leave so we can drop to lower tiers and have better fair fights.
---
I really want to wait for alliance change but meh.
---
Adding that maybe new weapons will never happen, considering each one of them will need 100+ skins at launch, plus 2 new legendaries for each.
---
Those months (likely years) of development could be put to much better use.
---
Absolutely only one? Nah before I clicked on this post I was like oh shit is this a NSFW post? But then was greeted with a cute Pic. So there is nothing wrong with thinking that this have some other connotations!
---
&gt;These unique weapons could also be modular so they can change their abilities to fit your playstyle depending on what traits you pick in the tree.
---
I hated artifact weapons in WoW: Legion
---
It stops giving AP once the total it has given you reaches 200 AP.
---
https://gw2crafts.net/scribe.html Approx 100gold if you have a guild hall with the right upgrades and whatnot.
---
Enough.
---
Yeah. Utter insanity.
---
There's absolutely NO reason why it should take this many *years* to get a *skin set*, or that after this many *years* there are THAT few amount of players with the *skin set*
---
A Whip for Necromancer for a more true minion master and maybe a Lute or Lyre for Mirage.
---
You don't need to ban people for petty text when you have such a powerful block function AND a chat filter. People are getting tired of censorship. I block people in pvp because I can't function when it's toxic. I don't report them because that's even more toxic than the harassers.

Never really thought about it but you could drop ice bow or fire greatsword (auto attack) for those WB fights where ranged is preferred, some dual attacks have ranged and air elemental minions have ranged attacks as well. Glyph of storms works well and Arcane Blast has a 1500 range too.
---
It was quite possible to break out even back in the day when we had only gliding. There's this one oddly placed updraft near the roof of one of the caverns that you can catch with a little tricky flying which will push you up a lattice of branches and onto the roof of the tunnels, from which you can roam basically anywhere in the map.
---
I want ANet to accept that the (gw2) trinity isn't going away and expand / rework all classes to have damage, control and support options that are actually comparable
---
You can do it!  And don’t forget to buy what you can from the vendor and renoun hearts every day.
---
well, obviously, yeah. sword isn't short on movement skills. I was thinking more for the cases where range is necessary for survival or to be effective (phase-shifted bounties)
---
You can have an NPE and recover from it. You can recover from most exceptions. Or a thread could error out and you just do nothing about it. 
---
try ... catch Exception ... showUser("Error. An error occurred.")
---
&gt;The kind of errors you didn't know could happen or expected are the ones that would crash the program or degrade it without throwing an error.
---
That's just straight up wrong.
---
This has been overdue for at least like 5 years.
---
GS2, GS3 while casting F1 and Power Spike is the typical burst combo. If someone with no defensive stats facetanks the entire combo, it'll oneshot them in less than a second, yes. The trick is to avoid facetanking the entire combo and counter-nuke them.
---
Just have to agree to disagree. I think players can be rewarded for being early adopters. Plenty of games reward players with something unique and special for preordering, or playing the beta.
---
It's also going to depend on where you happen to be standing.
---
Ambient lighting ruins everything :(
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-IACGTF3gw
---
Does this look familiar?
---
It depends on what you mean by the question.
---
If you're asking about how to survive, the answer is a matter of playstyle. Although I don't think it's intentional, the name "weaver" really describes how you need to play well: you should be weaving in and out of fights. Sword Weaver is extremely good at taking a step back during a fight and healing. It's also really good at generating barrier. The way you play is to go into the fight, get some barrier set up right away (how you do it depends on what your exact build is but there are various ways). Then, when you start to get low, you back out from the fight usually using Water #2, though there are other ways. You get some healing then repeat. The thing that's easy to misunderstand is that you're not really *leaving* the fight; you're just getting some distance briefly to get some healing in. When I play this way, I am very rarely actually out of the fight. It's usually water #2 and then right back in, so it's very fluid and you could almost describe it as graceful.
---
If you're asking how you deal with tagging or getting attacks on when at a distance, the answer is with utility skills.
---
Thanks for the input, I'll work on wrapping up the personal stories before looking into expansions. I didn't rush to level 80, I just don't find long questlines very interesting. What appealed to me most about GW2 in the first place was the ability to level up through events, exploration, etc. The personal story took the back seat.
---
Support Thief with Healing
---
Ranger with Hammer that focuses on having a super strong pet
---
Probably something with minions for Necro
---
Thanks! That’s exactly the info I needed.
---
Endgame is skins/prestige though for a lot of people.
---
So not having skins to strive for with a weapon type would make it dead on arrival for those.
---
For me dragonfall farm.. you get prettt decent map currency to eat from that
---
Fire greatsword usually covers it for me but the ice bow can help too.
---
I want an elite spec that changes how you use current weapons.  
---
I can see this being viable for the elementalist, with a martial arts elite spec.  
---
Attunements would become fight styles, staff would be a melee PBAoE weapon, dagger a single target melee spike weapon, scepter a defensive/control weapon (like a short staff), and focus a bit more like a shield. Then it could get a bow for ranged.
---
I'd love a set of elder dragon themed skins. Really want my own undead/plant dragons.
---
Vabbi keeps the cele Scourge there because it's a great build for newer players to the class because it keeps up with the corrupts and deals decent damage, all their guildies use power scourge with axe/offhand.  
---
Here are their own words, "No reason whatsoever to run condis when there are 10+ firebrands, 5+ scrappers and tempests in a blob that together can cleanse 1k+ conditions in 1 minute, celestial can still be viable just because it's a mix and can be good for new scourges to learn how to play the class while still having a decent damage."
---
It's really not that hard either.  You start in the first one.. grab one stone.. put it in door 2.. grab 2nd stone put it in door 2.. go in room 2.. you grab 3 stones one at a time and put it in door 3.. and just keep going until you eventually get to the end.
---
In my perfect world, something like this. The long gated epic/legendary collection to get your Skyscale? That would've been even more expensive and require Legendary mats. Eventually getting the ultimate Skyscale skin -- Aurene. An in game Legendary mount skin.
---
mastery 2 is actually pretty useless right now because the achievements tied to it got disabled. only use for it right now is for the last part of the skyscale collection + vision collection
---
It would reduce the value of crafted things since, you know, you wouldn't have to wait anymore.
---
Selling Charms when legendary runes and sigils coming up.   Would laugh if you needed these..
---
Something Something.. TP bots..
---
Not all stat selectable, but a majority, was included in the update notes.
---
The exceptions are Elite Specialization equipment (the weapons, even ascended, and the helm/shoulder/gloves for completing the spec), crafted backpacks (the level 78 exotic ones for example) and raid/fractal stuff (Assaulter's, Healer's etc).
---
Thumper hammer ranger similar to Gw1? :3
---
Did you look at the link in the title? It's not about the time gated items
---
why the fuck do you have +6k mithril ores?
---
I have been grinding for the bow for a while and am making it currently so doing all the stuff at once. Didn't realize it would take me 40-50 mins to refine all the mith/elder wood yikes!
---
nobody would ever sell ore anymore if they could insta-craft it into ingots.
---
You only have Ventari tablet [Purifying Essence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purifying_Essence) and [Renewing Wave](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Renewing_Wave). That's not a lot of condition removal compare to other classes and Purifying Essence drain a lot your energy.
---
If you are the only one that can see it, that means you are the chosen one. Only you can embark on this epic quest of legendary status, which yields some blues and greens...
---
That would be true for a lot of things if that would be the case.
---
yeah that's what netflix on a second monitor is for.
---
I craft all whenever I hit my storage cap (2K)

you cant now

Still waiting for a full on Bow Mage

I took a break for 5 or 6 years. I can't really say I have any regrets really except not being able to make up my mind on characters and wasting money on gear, only to change my mind later.

Nope, can't reset armor/weapons. The only things you can reset are certain specific trinket items by either infusing or attuning them (assuming they haven't been already) or by using the specific capacitor to reset them, though there are exceptions to this like Caladbolg which can be reset assuming that you had done the side story to reforge the weapon.
---
It stops at 250 AP.
---
There is currently no way to reset stats on weapons and armors.
---
Trinkets
---
&gt;
---
The stats on certain Ascended trinkets can have their stats reset by using their respective capacitor. Using this item will reset the stats of all respective trinkets in your inventory and destroy any upgrades placed in them (infusions and enrichments [verification requested]). It does not affect the ones currently equipped.
---
&gt;Bloodstone Capacitor
---
&gt;Blood Ruby Band
---
&gt;Blood Ruby Pendant
---
&gt;Blood Ruby Backpack
---
&gt;Mist Capacitor
---
&gt;Mist Talisman
---
&gt;Mist Pendant
---
&gt;Mist Band (Infused)
---
Pseudo stat reset
---
&gt;Infusing an Ascended ring or back item that has selectable stats will "reset" the item, allowing you to choose a different set of stats. This method is only possible once per ring or back item.
---
Likewise, attuning an Ascended ring will allow you to do the same thing. Also only possible once.
---
The Regrown Caladbolg can be changed to a different weapon through Ridhais after completing The Sword Regrown side story. Changing it will allow you to choose its stats again.
---
Despite being an ascended weapon, you cannot use the Mystic Forge to change its stats.
---
Similar to Ascended stat changing, using either of these methods will make you lose any upgrade components placed in them.
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
looks like kubrou from warframe, but with wings. awesome!
---
I guess it's a rare thing. The wiki kinda suggests that you can do it with any ascended armor with selectable stats. Well thanks for your help
---
IIRC Season 1 only gives around 2500 AP
---
Yeah, it was during the first Queen's Jubilee in 2013. After that, it never came back afterwards.
---
I would love to see a valkyrie elite spec using the spear as a land weapon (probably for the warrior)
---
Caladbolg functions more like a stat swap than a reset.
---
The wait time is part of what makes crafting a profitable endeavor. If you could insta-craft anything it would make it way too easy for everyone and the raw materials would hold less value. That would probably be an economic no-no.
---
lol @ people who complain about the state of the TP  
---
Go play Warframe or Elder Scrolls Online and you'll know true trading pain.
---
What about [Rapid Regeneration](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rapid_Regeneration) \+ [Medical Dispersion Field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Medical_Dispersion_Field), [Purge Gyro](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purge_Gyro) and [Bulwark Gyro](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bulwark_Gyro). This help a lot the support build to be even more support. Sure if you didn't need this amount of support you could go for something else but Scrapper still boost the Support power of the Engie.
---
They're a LOT more stingy with AP now and have been since HoT. So many things give 1 - 2ap now and I can't motivate myself to do them, I'm at like 32,450 or so, and 32.5k gives me like 5g and 1% to some account bonuses, so it's not a huge milestone that motivates me either.
---
&gt;Berserker doesn't work at all against any kind of semi-competent player, ...  
---
 
---
So, works fine against anything below plat2, and some above on the off-hours
---
Its not just you.
---
Thank you everyone. 
---
Anet answered to my request in few hours and they fixed the issue immediately.  
---
Like I said it was not on my side.
---
Thank to the support.
---
Snow Crows has a Healing Thief build up. Don't know how well it actually works though.
---
I'm sorry he's not alone. Welcome to the internet. If the skyscale was latched onto the shoulder or head, this misconception woulda not existed.
---
And I see so many apologists too.
---
"No, it's fine, it makes complete sense for Mystic Claymore to suddenly cost 50g. Farm more scrub!"
---
Accurate. Cuz I won't need to buy it with too much one time use and no friends...
---
I always though it was linked to these guide NPC in the city and an inconsistent implementation...  
---
And I agree this is incredibly frustrating!
---
In the last stage of the fractal legendary back pack someone said to me you could do the challenge modes in Tier 1.
---
Is that true?
---
The Challenges that are left for me:
---
 Underground Facility Challenge Mote	Activate the challenge mote, and complete the level 53 Underground Facility Fractal with an 80% reduction to healing.
---
Aetherblade Challenge Mote.png Aetherblade Challenge Mote	Activate the challenge mote, and complete the level 65 Aetherblade Fractal with an 80% reduction to healing.
---
Can these be done in Tier 1 or do they have to be done in Tier 3?
---
What was the old fractal 50 that made it require to minmax?
---
already have it , im looking to farm 30k volatile per day
---
No they shouldn't do that although they should make it so we can queue up what we want crafted and then let us continue to do other things while its crafting.
---
42k for the other, hellfire, backpiece
---
No, really. You just think druid is easier because probably its your go-to build for ages, and you know it well.
---
Lets look at renegade -&gt;
---
The base rotation consist of: stay in kalla with kalla elite up until energy empty, switch to ventari, use healskill to move tablet and use big heal or condi remove skill until energy empty. All while autoattacking with staff.
---
Situational skilluse: staff4 for additional condi removal, staff5 for cc and kalla healskill against a lot of condi pressure (sloth shake for example).
---
Now lets compare to druid -&gt;
---
Base rotation: Swap to warhorn to trigger quickdraw, use w5, go avatar, use skill4, 5 (or 3, depends on whats more needed, additional might or healing), use spirit skills, avatar skill 2 and leave avatar (triggers quickdraw again), use wh5, swap to staff, autoattack on staff. 
---
Situational skilluse: staff 5 projectile hate + staff 3, wh4 for vuln, keep porting spirits to new locations, you only need to use sun and heal spirit off cd, stay longer in avatar if players need healing... pet-cc, avatar cc.
---
Or lets look at firebrand -&gt;
---
With enough boon duration you just keep quickness and healskill mantra on 1 charge for 100% quickness, keep your symbol constantly up, autoattack with mace. As situational skills you use your other sources of aegis and/or SYG for stability. Tome3 for more aegis and a reflect, tome2 for burst healing.
---
Scepter/Warhorn tempest -&gt;
---
You swap between fire and earth, using on fire wh5+blasts or overload for opening, wh4 off cooldown, go to earth, use wh4 and overload. When healing is needed you go water, use scepter3, wh4, wh5... use your heal shout, use your utility shouts. And the only situational skill that isnt healing: go air for vuln application or cc on warhorn skills.
---
Healscourge is the only build I would somewhat agree, though its because you absolutely NEED to know every boss mechanic and need to be able to correctly predict it. Not because the build is difficult.
---
Imo, druid is rather one of the more challenging healing builds out there. Lots of decision making, limited healing.
---
And yes, I know exactly what Im talking about. I play every single healer and boon-support build in existence.
---
&gt; its actually a harder build to play overall as core Guard gets a DPS bonus from maintaining Aegis
---
I'm aware of that. However I meant for OP to play Core Guard to be familiar with the skills and traits. Once that's achieved, OP can expand it to DH by including traps into the rotation. Even when not min-maxing, Core Guard can be effective, interactive and fun to play :)
---
I have stacks, I sell my extras.
---
What, that is not wipe but only 2 person died. Pretty much still finishable.
---
I found once I had the wall mastery I basically never use springer. There are a lot of spots that are just plain easier to climb up with skyscale.
---
It did take a bit of getting used to, but skyscale covers gaps and height better than raptor or springer. Its fast with gaps thanks to dash and it's ok at height. Springer is faster but if you miss you fall down. Skyscale can't really miss.
---
Yes, I'd love to. I think we are not getting them now, sadly, but in a content after ls5. If we were to get new elite classes it would create logistic problem. Is ls5 a PoF one? Then PoF gives us 18 elite classes. Is it core game? Then all free players could get it. This would require us to get a lot of HP points spread over new maps and would probably require few episodes to do.
---
Also, there is no indication from devs that this is coming. Classes update is huge so they probably should start doing trailers.
---
What I think that after LS5 we are getting small paid, cheap content expansion with elite classes, maybe one big map and new story prologue.
---
Well, the latest balance patch they did very much seem to imply that the plan was to go over all the Elite specs in a similar manner. 
---
Reducing the number of dodges for mirage will just make it bad, considering that a rather major part of the rotation IS dodging.
---
Bone theme for necro. Or condi dps with real, not-meme numbers.
---
Do dragonhunters or reapers (without minions) have better survivability in general? And are dragonhunters harder to play than reaper? Currently have a reaper, thinking about dragonhunter.
---
I've been running a Condi-Toughness-Barrier build and can tank most things a lot better than before. Use water 2 and launchers like air 4 to give myself space when needed, but I nevee attack from range, I'm wielding a sword damnit.
---
If I want range I go staff weaver or staff tempest, and spec for power.
---
they pretty much said that they only released the first of them and not all
---
also spellbreaker already has reduced max adrenaline so i don't know what you're talking about there
---
Pretty much anything that can be farmed - Silverwastes, Dragonfall, LS4 Maps, HoT. If there's a farm for it, we farm it!
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
We have quite a few that are partnered with us! Feel free to hit up their Guild Reps :)
---
Yes! I am going to join this group! I am so sick and tired of being lost on farming for gold and making minimal profits!
---
It would be nice if conjures functioned like signets, while it's off cooldown it gives you a passive stat bonus
---
It’s easier if you’re condi as well, since weaver has a ton of condition damage skills and traits. Water has some good condi dual skills like water/earth and water/fire.
---
Condi also allows you to juke around while dots kill them.
---
1797 at this moment!
---
You're probably counting online members + total members. But that Online members is counted in the total member count already.
---
We'd be glad to have you! :D
---
Ah yeah, my bad
---
Except they can grey options out instead of hiding them, even add multicoloured tooltips as to *why* a purchase option is locked.
---
    You have reached the daily purchase limit of &lt;numLimit&gt; items.
---
would be vastly preferable to these confirmation prompts at least to me.
---
Dw it only bounces five times max
---
The stupid thing they did was extending the evade duration for mirage on top of having additional evades through traits and utilities on top of a class that has access to invuln in the base class on top of stealth on top of forced target drop but that is from a pvp perspective, maybe the devs just forgot it existed.
---
Dragonhunters, they kill faster, but are easy killed by mobs if played passively reapers are more forgiving in that sense. Both are good aoe, mob mass control classes, with reaper winning in this category.
---
Suggest playing DH after reaper, for variety and in case you struggle picking up squishier classes right away.
---
Demmahum, I have come to bargain!
---
Have you tried the meteor farms in Istan?
---
Oh there I am, right next to you.
---
Literally go watch it work in a high level AT in EU, full of plenty of competent players. Jawgeous has a video on it. I also explicitly said "if you want to meme around".
---
Yes it is. You must be thinking of the randomized glicko matchmaking done on server relinks only.  The color bl your server is assigned now is thru 1up1down matchmaking. So red server normally is the server that came in first in the tier below. Green server is usually the third place server from the tier above and blue is the 2nd place server that stays in the same tier. This is all explained in the wiki!
---
I'd probably prefer Sword Necro but I am 100% with you on Spear Warrior, Mace Engi and especially GS Rev.
---
Only nevermore, astralaria, chuka and hope are gen 2 and need collection. Weapons after that don't need a collection, only money sink
---
on a serious note, are these models not smaller to make them look like they are further away (like housing high up in DR)?
---
so when i click "leave squad" the player i right-clicked on gets kicked? awesome! :D
---
do you mean like /sqjoin [name]?
---
Sure you can remove waiting, for a fee.
---
I'm still dreaming about whip for warrior and some limited pet support to make him a beast master
---
i mostly manage staying melee but if I have to stay ranged I drop a fiery greatword. If nothing works i Swap to staff
---
No. Once you're in a squad or party, you can rbm on someone and join their instance of the map. I want a chat command that does exactly that
---
Don't wait. Go take a piss or make a sandwich.
---
Please!!!! That was my jam in RA!
---
Funny how different people remember different things. That dev post said how JQ and FA were within 10% of BG's playhours, which was the highest of all servers, not counting the links.
---
Isn't guild arena a pve spec/balance?
---
&gt; The uneasy excuse used during Season 1 was Scarlet wasn't (known to be) a minion of an Elder Dragon and even though she was causing more damage than the dragons (including destroying Lion's Arch) the Pact "only deals with dragon threats".
---
The storyline itself makes decent sense tbh, what does *not* fit is *our* involvement in it as the Commander. If you start LS1 as a new lvl30-ish character reaching the "join an Order" point shortly *after* the defeat of Zhaitan of course you'd be elated to help quell local threats and band together with fellow adventurers, safer too now that the threat of drowning in Risen any day of the week is gone. The Pact meanwhile can be busy going after the Claw of Jormag and building shipyards/airships, I don't recall *ever* seeing an airship drydock but they certainly must have them somewhere. 
---
Scarlet's attack on LA canonically lasted a week or two and most of that time was waiting for the miasma to clear, the main question here is why Whispers failed us ("us" being the **real** Pact Commander, not the LS1 protagonist) but then that issue has plagued pretty much every single GW2 storyline. Even when the Pact is taking centre stage they don't seem to have any actual intelligence agents other than their second-in-command.
---
&gt; The writers lost control of their story and continuity when they abandoned the Pact as the vehicle for the narrative and invested everything into Dragon's Watch, who require constant maintenance to justify why they featured so prominently in the story.
---
The "justification" was/is that "many people" felt the Pact itself homogenised the Orders and robbed them of their unique features, effectively blaming it for the bland and rushed aspects of the later story chapters. Both the opening and the ending of HoT are excellent for reigning in the "boring invincible army at our service" aspect of it so our lone PC can still feel impactful in comparison but neither of those nor that purpose actually require any LS1 nonsense.
---
Less bloat/power creep and more of an alternate playstyle
---
Ok, fair. Now that I think about it, Elementalists have Water and Arcane/Earth, Guardians have Virtues and honor, Revs have Salvation and Invocation, all those can be healers in core, even if not as good as their specialization counterparts. Even Rangers and Necros, who just have one specialization for support, have other core traits to enhance healing/support. So, ok, my bad.
---
Here in this community someone says trailblazer scourge can solo champions. It's pretty survivable actually. Using dire gear right now though. I'm sorry but I can't go Reaper, any other idea?
---
I'm sorry but i thought the warclaw skins were horrible. One looks like a shaved lion or something.
---
&gt; other idea?
---
yea, "Power Scourge (from wvw, and adapt it for pve) at metabattle once the api is fixed."
---
Also, sorry, what is the reason, expansion or hpoints?
---
For general pve conjures are an option but not really that great. If a certain boss fights call for ranged attacks you just have to switch your weapon there is no other way. I teached myself to play sword similiar to how the user above described, and it's actually pretty similiar to how you would play bunker weaver in pvp as well, with all the iframe and barrier rotation, tough you don't need to equip additional iframes on the utility for it, I just used additional stances instead of it to tank the smaller damage since pve is not as bursty as pvp can be. 
---
Overall I was enjoying open world sword weaver very much, it was a refreshing change and a welcome challenge to learn it. Hard to give specific tips since it's been a while since I played it, but I didn't find a good way to make a hybrid ranged build, imho it's better to just go full melee stance build and play like that. If you really need to do ranged, you just have to switch weapons for that situation.
---
&gt; with her Sister story
---
They did manage to throw me off with that one though, I was *sure* Belinda would die in the interim after her introductory episode :P
---
&gt;Isn't guild arena a pve spec/balance?
---
Yes, it is. Is there no chance to record fights for this reason?
---
When in zergs, I switch to staff, when soloing i run Sw/D. Glyphs help alot and elite skill for fire GS. Just have a spare staff in the inventory for kinda fast switch.
---
I mean u'r probably right with the legendary armor + weapons, but then how many people have legendary armors and weapons, and how many have radiant backpack skins? We need some prestige rewards in this game, and since those skins require a lot of work to put into them, I think they should stay as they are.
---
 I don't think AP system needs a revamp, all we need is just some compensation for season1 &amp; all the un-achivable achivements, like from Dragon Bash festival or some WvW/PvP achivements.
---
New visuals for skills that aren't just flat AoE; if they can do orange burning cuboid walls effects for Forged enemies, they certainly are able create something as fancy for elite specs
---
Elites that may reuse same weapons but won't use same skill types; let's say elementalist gets new elite but while having it equipped, core skills of scepter are different and perhaps even weapon is changed to two-handed type
---
Elites based on stances that doesn't require energy to maintain - think of it as firebrand that can continuously use tome skills or reaper that doesn't leave shroud
---
Special action keys for additional skills or mechanics (a skill for mesmer elite placing its clones manually so these could do mechanic) could be implemented within specializations. And so could be bundle objects that you or people nearby have to pick up, gather around object - anything that would require some "thinking".
---
cool story bro
---
Well *someone* never got around to playing mesmer pre-HoT...
---
Seriously the number of times Phase Retreat and iLeap just left you stuck in the now non-rendering walls or straight up dumped you underneath the playable map was unreal. Some of the Graveling burrows in AC would also port you into a wall if you stood on them as they collapsed. Oh and in DS you can *feel* like you're map-breaking just by *walking* because they really cheaped out with some area textures and decorations (or lack thereof).
---
Or you could ruin your immersion without even leaving the tutorial zone by standing next to a wall and swivelling the camera inside your head. I recommend not to do that if you are squeamish though.
---
If you need need ranged you shouldnt be sword. But mostly los things use your prts to get ontop. I usually play weav air arcane and i can throw a arcane blast skill on if its needed but im so mobile i usually dontneed
---
No, that graph definitely had BG as the most active by a margin.
---
You can settle with the ocean, or possible papier-mâché backgrounds. We all knew from the start, maps were instanced.
---
Ofc. continuous maps would be a blast, and if you could travel without visible loading screens from one corner to the other, be it on Airships, Mounts, or lay lines would definitely kick ass! But that would only available via Guild Wars 3, i suggest hydra type 3 headed dragon for a logo.
---
Why?
---
There is no "Founder" or similar packages in GW2; you're just getting some extra fancy or useful stuff that doesn't put you ahead of other players.
---
That log out pop up instead of /gg lol.
---
Ok. Thank you. So I guess that there is no chance to record logs in gvg hall when we train... :'(
---
If the new weapon has strong skills, people will use it in pvp even without skins.
---
hi  
---
what time is the patch?
---
You are making excellent points! I agree wholeheartedly with you.
---
unless u/deltaconnected is able to add this ability.
---
/r/enlightenedcentrism beckons.
---
Look, I get what you're saying - people shouldn't attack those that disagree with them, and that doing so only pushes them further away instead of bridging the gap and promoting understanding.  The only way to truly make long-term change is to come to the table and break bread, etc.
---
But dude, it's a little tone-deaf to bring that up in a support topic, no?
---
Plus, the reality is that people get pushed to this edge by extreme hostility and in some cases life threatening moments.  I don't think it's entirely fair or reasonable of you to say "hey just hug it out man" when the people we'd reach out to would just meet you with a knife in the face. 
---
Yes, in an ideal world people would be all calm and patient on all sides of an issue and have healthy, rational debates.  That is fundamentally not possible when one particular stance on an issue is "hey let's get rid of all of 'em" and those believers point-blank refuse to come to the table.  I grew up with very religious people and have spent a lot of time trying to speak to them about this - some things you aren't going to change with patience and sweetness, and frankly speaking certain people see that as weakness or permission to walk all over you in the name of their narrow-minded beliefs.
---
It seems in your endeavor to listen to the other side and mend bridges, you've gotten a little inundated with selective news/tweets/etc. of people being verbally abusive towards those who disagree with them.  Keep in mind that's a vocal minority, and don't let it color your perception so much that you start assuming everything is the same because everyone sucks.  Those things are especially curated by those news sources to rally the side and make them go "oh look how terrible these people are!" and that way they can continue supporting the same bigotry they've been supporting.
---
The direct power equivalent to trailblazer isn't available in PvE, unfortunately. Trailblazer scourge can derp into mildly strong champions as long as you can kite and avoid constantly taking direct hits, because it involves putting on traits that give you passive healing, mainly through parasitic contagion -- but no power equivalent to contagion exists, so you're out of luck for a direct power replacement in traits as well.
---
Power scourge isn't really something you do because it's "good". You can research whatever stat combinations are accessible to you and provide similar stats. You'll end up being a negative overall contributor to meta events if you go too far into defense. Heck, if you're doing events where people are actually dying, put on transfusion and help out that way instead.
---
I like wells optionally paired with spectral grasp, but you really don't need scourge to do that. They can be traited to provide protection and healing, so feel free to run full offensive gear if that's what you're doing. Death perception in soul reaping remains accessible; just dump shroud and all your wells on whatever needs dying. But you might as well do that with reaper... or even core necro.
---
I'm playing power reaper and it's a faceplanting tank: pop into shroud to deal big melee damage and when the shroud ends you're still at full health. You might now lose some health but you still have your healing skill and once you get your shroud back (spectral grasp to fill your life force often at once) you can faceplant again and your health fills while you do damage thanks to the Soul Eater trait.
---
I love playing it

[ARENA NET] [Daniel Snider.6241 posted on 2019-06-10 17:45:17](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/947659#Comment_947659):
---
&gt; Hello,
---
&gt;I'd like to give a quick update on what's going on with render.guildwars2.com just so there's clarity into the progress being made.
---
&gt;### The Short Version
---
&gt;render.guildwars2.com is still broken, but we're working on it. We'll understand the problem better after tomorrow's patch.
---
&gt;### The Longer Version
---
&gt;The code behind render.guildwars2.com has two changes that will go out with the deploy tomorrow.
---
&gt;First is better logging. Internally we send a signal to the server to have it "go to sleep" and "wake back up". It's going to sleep, but only parts of it are waking back up which puts us into a bad state. We've improved the logs so that we can see how we're getting into this state and why.
---
&gt;While in this strange zombie state, the server is leaking system resources. An innocent victim of this is API white list server which figuratively explodes when it gets starved of the resource (there is an independent investigation to improve the robustness of the white list server). The second change is that the resource leak is fixed.
---
&gt;### What Does All This Mean?
---
&gt;* render.guildwars2.com will still be broken until we solve the root cause.
---
&gt;* render.guildwars2.com won't cause the API white list to lose its data at random times anymore.
---
&gt;Thank you everyone for your patience while we solve this issue.
---
&gt;-Snider

---
You can remove the wait for crafting ingots by buying ingots instead of ore.   You made the choice to buy the ore presumably because since it's cheaper (lots of people do), and the reason it's cheaper is because of the time it takes to refine it.
---
The need to refine larger amount of ore is not new, so to hope this gets changed now is just welcoming disappointment.  Instead, use this feature instead to take out the garbage to make your mother/wife/girlfriend/cat/significant other happy, then brush your teeth, fold that laundry sitting in the corner of your room, and vacuum under your computer desk (when was the last time you looked under there?).   By the time you come back, you will only have to wait 5 more minutes.  
---
And next time, buy ingots.
---
If he has 200+ mastery levels he has both expansions.
---
es Anet planned all this when GW1 got vanquishing. They are actually time travelers
---
only for skyscale didnt try to consume for magic
---
imgur mirror?
---
ty will try that
---
Bless your heart
---
There are a few ways **if** you can get to him in-game or view some screenshots/videos of him playing. Mounts are exclusive to Path of Fire and gliding is exclusive to Heart of Thorns, dedicated players will also have most of their associated masteries unlocked which would display a number over 250 where the level should be (bottom left of the screen for yourself, or the number displayed below the healthbar for other players).
---
While obviously not quite as personal you can also buy the ingame cash-currency "gems". It will definitely be understood as "here's some cash, but in GW2" kinda on par with an amazon voucher (more like a specialty DIY store) but the game is designed such that you can buy *most* things starting from gems.
---
And sorry if I come off as a little condescending, from your post it's not clear to me whether you yourself actually play the game.
---
Next time buy the ingots directly.
---
We were going to release SAB World 3 and 4, but yeah, this seems to be better idea.
---
Giant slayer doesn’t take too long anymore since PoF btw.
---
Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day...
---
Search "-skyscales"
---
Don't relist but you might have to wait a month or two. I sold Flameseeker Prophecies with a 10 gold undercut within six hours, it took me three or more weeks of constantly being undercut (at one point there were around ten listings below mine) before my Bifrost sold.
---
A lot of players are selling legendaries outside of the game so they avoid the listing fee and the TP tax. Unfortunately this means regular traders are competing with cheaper legendaries which makes yours take longer to sell.
---
Try listing it, undercut by a small amount and if you don't need the money any time soon, wait patiently for it to sell.
---
redistabutible ill gander.
---
Since anet killed wvw? Nope
---
I'll have my one single fish on patch day ty
---
And someone will start playing the game today
---
My exact thought.
---
Doesn't change the point. When the collections were released they were cheaper because the spike on material prices (basically elder wood) was not that high. But that's not the point. Those collections were not designed to compete with the TP (market prices are volatile anyway) but to make things easier for people. Raising 800g for Dusk might be troublesome for some people. It could take them quite some time and maybe they would be tempted to use the gold for something else, but if you can go completing steps of something like 100g at a time it gives you a sensation of progress and at the same time make it easier to focus on your goal even if you have to pay a global 1000g at the end.
---
Like i stated before, the only change i would have made is to place the gold sink as the last collection, not at the second one. That would allow people to enjoy the scavenger hunts.
---
What I feel? It’s always been immersion braking. Look at the world map, beautiful colors, sure, but everything is a rectangle and everything is bordered with mountains even though it makes 0 sense. Do mounts make it more obvious? Well, it was obvious already so I don’t really care about the impact the mounts have on immersion, in that sense. Hey, the game is limited. Technically gw2 is still gw1. Everything is instanced just like in gw1 except they made the instances hold more people, that’s it. It won’t change either because apperantly updating the engine ‘is not worth it’ as if making an investment into making the game better is ‘not worth it’. The only way updating the game engine is not worth it is if anet doesn’t expect (or didn’t expect) the game to live as long as it has. In reality though they shot themselves in the foot. 130 people got fired and bow they have a half baked cake and no one to finish it, great. I want to see gw2 to live another 10 years. It will not with an old engine. I get it, it’s a huge job to update it, I really do get it. It is an investment into the future though. A worthwhile investment. It would likely make creating new content easier too. What do you tell people that have shitty or just “wrong” computers? “fuck off and enjoy your 20 fps with 100 ping”? Yeah, the engine is so bad that it even can’t handle internet latency. I tested this, i have 2 computers. Intel i5 runs gw2 amazingly well. The other whatever HP shit it is (same internet connection) runs like a snail. On my intel i get 30 ping, on the other one i get 120 ping... Yeah, the game’s optimization IS dogshit, let’s not cut corners here and call it for what it is. So...your immersion is broken, content takes ages to develop, bug everywhere, low fps high ping. But heyyyy anet did say and they sure know best- it’s not worth it.
---
And from 5 years from now, what will you tell new people that wanna try the game but at that point new computers might not even run the damn game to begin with? You tell them nothing because there’s nothing to say.
---
Thanks for listening to my ted talk on how anet doesn’t know what’s best for the game.
---
https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/
---
You. I like your flair.
---
Also, no, I don't use sword in open world anymore. It's not even the lack of range, but being locked in close range with few uninterruptible animations on squishest class in the game with no reliable access to stability or aegis. Giving up utilities and traits is an option, but at that point you're just weaker power firebrand in any situation.
---
Tuesday patches typically hit at 9am Pacific, 12pm eastern, 4pm UTC/Server time. They can sometimes run late, and have once or twice gone as late as 11pm servertime. 
---
Bookmark this site: https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/ as it's usually pretty accurate on when the next patch will be. Does not take into account hotfixes / emergency patches because well, they're not planned. That way you can keep up to date with what's going on :)
---
It would be interesting if they work on it.
---
Even in T3 its a Joke, todays dps is way to high. If you look in T4 LFG for a group or just ask some buddys you met along the way you can oneshot those boses.
---
If you struggle oneshotting and still need a healer go for Firebrands or Scourges. Firebrands hps throughput is so mental they heal right through that 80% reduction(not to mention Aegis, Stability, Protection etc.) and Scourges barrier are not affected at all.
---
Ad Infinitum in 2019 is easy to get since you can compare it to a regular T3 recomended fractal, if you go down there from T4 everything is most likely down in under 10sec - even bosses.
---
I've sold maybe 10 legendaries, all except one were sold within 24 hours of listing. The last one I sold took 2 weeks because of multiple people undercutting.
---
Depends how much you undercut and day of the week.
---
So, you are advocating selling power (a new weapon with strong skills) so PvPers can use it, while leaving out the Fashion Wars appeal by only having a basic skin?
---
Sounds like a perfect recipe for community outrage.
---
Contact gw2 support through official website, or if you refuse to use proper methods, altervatively use reddit's sesrch tool to find out solution instead of spamming sub.
---
What ever price you put it up for, leave it there. Its going to cost you like 125g (5% of item worth) to put it on the tradepost. 
---
Look at **Additional Fees**: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trading\_Post](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trading_Post)
---
Worth every penny.
---
Get a Heal Scourge or play one yourself. They carry your ass through mechanics.
---
thanks
---
&gt; like how candy cane nodes sometimes pop up in certain maps.
---
I'm so glad this is actually a known thing that happens in game. I was starting to think I was going crazy seeing those things pop in for like half a second then disappear.
---
I am new to this game and hated this kind of "immersion" in other MMOs. I am just curious, but why are people here defending it so much? All it does is waste your time. Even when just leveling crafting it's a timedrain. Imo games should be fun and there is nothing really enticing about looking at UI windows for extended periods of time.
---
Would love a ranger with shield. No idea how it would be but it would scratch my pathfinder itch for a sword shield ranger i play mostly on pathfinder.
---
When rats are starving they resort to eating feces
---
The little diamond thing you get when you alt-click on the map. At least, I'm pretty sure they call themselves personal waypoints when you hover over them. Might be personal marker or something.
---
did you try -repair parameter already?!
---
It’s just a tag to add, no big deal.
---
Wait the door thing is a mastery? Fml i didnt even realize
---
I did it! That's a real hard one. Thank you so much for that! I hope its ok to add it. I did add your name and video in the description.  [https://youtu.be/m370K0kqXfw](https://youtu.be/m370K0kqXfw)
---
Is anyone able to login?
---
same in the tomb of primeval kings
---
Is there an upcoming balance patch?
---
As a returning player, this hurts. ;(
---
Came from GTA 5
---
Weekend sales are boosted by a large margin.
---
It was [*Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare*](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-f-to-pay-respects)...
---
In 5 days when I have all the needed Charged Quartz Crystals, I will be finishing Zap with around 400g spend, using my own mats.
---
Being that it is crafted using the collection and about 1 year after I crafted my last legendary, I don't consider this a cost, since all of these mats have been gathered, while I was enjoying content I like.
---
In terms of raw cost, it does count, it's just that after crafting this Bolt, the next ones will have to be crafted from scratch taking into account all cost, as you say.
---
If this sale goes well, I am planning of snowballing ( crafting legendaries using the profit and selling again).
---
Thanks, Captain Obvious. You ever think about quitting your job to pursue comedy?
---
Don't.
---
Permafrost for the white. There's still nothing that PERFECTLY matches the silver-ness of the metal parts of the radiant armour though :-(
---
My type of server.
---
I just want a skyscale lol. A gargoyle skin would be nice for my necro
---
You are a furthest from last person i would consider for taking an advice from. Eat a dick.
---
So was your gold, now once we know it was free of cost, just send it over to me.
---
My longest wait was when I by sheer luck got a Permanent Bank Access from a map completion key - I put it on the TP for 4,7 K (which was at that point a hundred gold below the cheapest listing) and then got undercut for four months straight. But one day I woke up and found myself moderately wealthy, so just leave your stuff up if there isn't a SIGNIFICANT change in supply and demand!
---
(And items like that are extreme examples. Leggies should not take THAT long to sell, a month at max seems plausible.)
---
PVP is in a sorry state...
---
One raid a year and barely any content in them...
---
WVW is dying for the 45th time in a row...
---
Open world doesn't have any worthy content...
---
But hey... you get 3 hours of living season every 4 months that is literally killing the game itself. So...
---
&gt; If he ended up in the "Raid Realm"
---
It's not only human only, btw, because Dhuum ate ALL souls that was coming to the underworld until we sealed him again. It was never mentioned that Dhuum only put ends to Human's souls
---
&gt; most likely the domain of the lost
---
Domain of the lost is not something place where you can EASY go out. Also it was never said, that Snaff or Eir came from it, because... Eir actually accepted her death, she had peace before death, it's unlikely for her to go to domain of the lost. Also, she could be guided by Glint, because Glint have power in Mist. Same with Snaff. Tybalt had non of them. He literally no-name for legendary beings as with all mentors.
---
&gt; I mean Mad King Thorns realm is also in the Underword and yet it's safe from Dhuum
---
If we talk from real perspective it's because Anet too lazy to change already working event.... There is 0 sense for this realm to be unaffected by gods leaving, because it was the Gods who kept all beast around in check.
---
&gt; Also we met souls and judge in the domain of the losts
---
And we also seen that it was crumbled and Eater of Souls (looks familiar, huh?) was savaging it. So it's not safe there. 
---
&gt; We know that Eir and even Snaff went to another realm of the mists
---
We don't? We know only that Glint got them at some point somewhere. And as i mentioned before:
---
&gt; All newly dead unguided souls arrive here when they enter the Mists from Tyria
---
&gt; unguided souls
---
Glint is one of the legendary beings so she actually CAN guide souls and get them if she needed them
---
Mirage does gain super speed though, and I feel being able to dodge without interrupting actions is actually really useful sometimes... it doesn't really feel like much of a trade off, at least within raids. 
---
&gt;I do not agree with ANet's stance in general though: the opportunity cost of not having a third traitline should in itself be enough and explicit downgrades within the elite spec should exist for thematic reasons only. Currently that still means nerfing elite specs though.
---
I agree completely. At this point giving elite specs 'trade offs' feels really, really half-hearted and realistically, it's not going to change much in the way that people play and use builds, especially after years of playing those elite specs without those half-hearted 'trade offs' that aren't really having any impact.
---
If they really wanted to have proper trade offs between core and elite specs, they would need to undo *years* of power creep at this point, and I think several core trait lines are probably in need of a bit of an overhaul to boot, at least for PvE.
---
Hey, I'm thinking about gearing my 4th alt, a Firebrand. I already have PDPS weaver, a hybrid heal/condi scourge  and PDPS warrior, so I wanted something more oriented towards boon support and condi damage. I mainly do T4 fractals, and want to get into CMs at some point. Is quickness support condi DPS Firebrand a thing ? Is it fun ? From the guides I've seen on metabattle it does not seem very popular.
---
F
---
The Titanic sinks and Vader is Luke's dad.
---
Yes. We should finish it sooner, but our DPS melted down faster than I should res. All of us already used up the tear buffs. There are about 15 tears in this room. 
---
I just find it was funnier after we spawned on it.
---
Congratulations on getting this monumental task done . The sheer patience and determination.  Just awesome. Your character looks amazing.
---
&gt; bank is SW
---
Could you refresh my memory on that?
---
&gt; from crafting stations
---
Technically every map with crafting station (inc. all 1-15 maps), Mount Maelstrom has a banker. And there is trade post agent at Junction Camp and 2 other locations in Harathi, Town of Nolan, Bitterfrost Peaks, Traveler's Dale, etc... [for full list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Trader). But i agree, they are quite rare everywhere else.
---
I do have the same question to OP, why do you need a TP and bank desperately enough, just plan ahead, salvage and deposit everything, tp whatever you need from ui, pick it up later.
---
From a lore point of view, it would make little sense, considering how we got there and what's going on there. Seems to me it's the same as pretty much every other LS map.
---
&gt; Mirage does gain super speed though, and I feel being able to dodge without interrupting actions is actually really useful sometimes... it doesn't really feel like much of a trade off, at least within raids. 
---
Raids maybe and PvP definitely by a *huge* margin, which was the main design problem with mirage from the start. You're wrong about the superspeed though, a regular dodge moves you roughly the same distance as running *with* superspeed does and the latter only works facing forwards. Keep in mind sword ambush *already* moves you forwards and shouldn't scale with movespeed so you only actually benefit on axe (hey, another major flaw with mirage!) or while lootsticking with GS.
---
no u
---
you aimed at wrong reply link
---
as dead as you
---
Nice.
---
from a pvp perspective i think whats more stupid is that you are being able to dodge while being cc'ed.
---
thematically speaking the land was just created from the mists and appeared from nowhere.  i doubt evon gnashblade has workers in the pact to just pop up shop where ever theres a battle and they wouldn't have been there before the pact arrived as the land didn't exist
---
No, never was. The way things are going, it also doesn't look like it will be anytime soon.
---
i know i'm dead
---
wimpy pistol mesmer, cower before the *HAMMER MESMER*
---
Yes Anet actually shut down the servers in 2012 and the game has all been a dream.
---
Major Spoiler btw
---
&gt; Could you refresh my memory on that? 
---
[B A N K](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mercenary_Requisitioner)
---
As dead as Joko
---
Yea but Firebrand pDPS sounds weird since his first tome is full burning.
---
Is condi damage for fractal T4 pugs and maybe CM later on really bad or.... ?
---
I read a massive forum post by arena net last summer of last year that they planned to have it rolling out on December of 2018.  I hope they do release this because I love PVP in Guild Wars 2!!!
---
People have speculated that the main prize had to be anonymous for privacy reasons. Which is odd since usually when you enter, you agree to be used as marketing material for the company anyway...
---
Still, even a "Congratulations to the winner! The car is going to that country!" message would've been nice from a PR perspective.
---
Not bad, and depends on pugs, but not better than Power.
---
He's there to wash the ledges.
---
Honestly, no more until they fix the current power creep balance mess.
---
For someone like me who crafts lots of legendaries, any boost to spirit shard gain is a must have. Otherwise, not really worth it.
---
The mists work in mysterious ways
---
I don't get why you're getting downvoted. You're perfectly correct and polite at the same time. What's wrong with the people on this sub?
---
Why does Eric Andre make such good memes? lol
---
GS Rev, LB Ele, the addition of some kind of 2h Fist weapon that can be given to Guardian, Thief and Mesmer (the latter of which would use it to channel energy more than to punch things).
---
Some people seems angry. I have friends who started the game less than one month ago, I know they browse reddit sometimes. I hope they won't see this post. 
---
I think some people are angry about the "spoilery line". I know time flies, but since our goal is to be also friendly to new players, some spoiler tag—it costs nothing—would be nice, in my opinion. 
---
Some subs still do this, even if the game has been out for years (e.g. /r/StardewValley). 
---
I don't mind losing some Internet points, but I kind of feel sad that people went so angry about this. I guess the spoilery line is a taboo topic.
---
Inside a simulation
---
Yeah, but keeping the surprise is worth the try. Why do you thing we still say to kids that Santa exists? Why do we keep the end of Hyperion secret? Why is Sherlock Holmes such a good book? 
---
Being sensitive doesn't cost much, but it can bring a lot. 
---
At least, in my opinion.
---
I'd love to have one giant continuous map, but we all knew this wasn't the case from before the game even launched. The alternative I guess would be that they don't even allow flying in the vanilla maps?
---
Personally that would annoy me even more. I hate when games do that (looking at you FFXIV).
---
Perhaps they could devote some resources to making painted backdrops for the other maps, but that would take time away from other projects as well as potentially impact performance for some players I imagine. Maybe it wouldn't be too bad, though.
---
The post last summer said, "At this time, we do not have a date to share with the community but we are actively working toward internal milestones. We plan to post periodic updates when we have interesting or relevant information to share."
---
I'm with you about wanting them to give some more information about it, though.
---
Well said mate
---
I main a power reaper using berserkers gear. Pure power. The lifesteal and managing between my two health bars means its pretty hard to down me.
---
&gt; Please explain which part of "we expect to continue doing this in future updates" is unclear.
---
The "in the future updates" part as looking at the move to PoF was when they suddenly felt the need to update the HoT Elite Specs.
---
I have 2 Mist-Talismans right now, bought the thing to reset their stats, one got reset, the other kept its stats, bought 2 more of the Mist Capacitor, still kept the old stats, I wanna cry, can anyone help me? ;-;
---
Anything that was crafted once can be crafted again.
---
The world is FULL of replicas of Sohothin and Magdaer: the fiery dragon swords. Those replicas were not perfect, but they were created back in the day before we had legendary researchers and the Mystic forge, and before we figured out how to convince Zommoros to give us a perfect replica (Like Sunrise) after we give him an imperfect one (like Dawn).  
---
What could not be done before can be done now.  
---
If you heavily dislike the idea of crafting extra ones, then there's also the possibility that Zommoros isn't really crafting the legendary weapon, but using his mythwright cauldron to pull a version of the original weapon from the remains of a version of Tyria that was destroyed in an alternate universe, by throwing in materials that would 'call' to it. 
---
So you don't really get *the* Claw of the Khan-Ur, but *a* Claw of the Khan-Ur.
---
Collections were cut for later Gen 2 legendaries, but if they were not, you'd probably had to go through processes similar to the ones required to craft the original Claw.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing (You said you have already checked the wiki but just posting for clarity, haha)
---
I have used this in the past to my ascended weapons so I don't see why the wiki should be wrong about doing it to armor. It does destroy all upgrades, like the wiki says.
---
Not sure about other 'selectable armors' but illustrious is changeable with that recipe. Anet added it to the game a little after ascended armor was introduced as per community requests/complaints.
---
Some ideas I have:
---
- Ranger with Rifle —&gt; Hunter
---
- Necromancer with Hammer —&gt; Minion Master
---
- Guardian with Dagger —&gt; Monk
---
- Revenant with Scepter —&gt; Ritualist
---
- Warrior with Staff or Spear —&gt; Paragon
---
- Thief with Greatsword —&gt; Samurai (something like that)
---
A Sword Necro turning into a beast in shroud (active predator style to finally give the class mobility &gt;\_&lt;)
---
A Rifle Ranger that synchros themselves up with the pet
---
A Hammer Memser working with Dark and Light fields
---
A Torch thief highwayman
---
Fair point! Thank you!
---
Why would we need main cities if every outpost had everything? 
---
You can sell stuff on the go. The volatile magic traders have salvage kits and buy trash. You dont need to have currencies ON you to buy from the traders. So what would you need a TP and a bank for in the first place?
---
Thank you so much, I do not play at all, so this is all very helpful.
---
Thank you
---
oh so THATs what he does oO
---
Thank you so much man, your community is awesome
---
Are they both in your inventory?  It says right in the product description:
---
&gt;resets one each of Mist Band, Mist Pendant, and Mist Talisman if in your inventory. 
---
Stick the one that got reset in your bank and try again.
---
Well if you didn't hoard them and craft them all in one go the wait would have been minimal, since you'd only be crafting a bit every day. If the waiting goes away noone will sell the raw materials, since it's 0 effort to craft your drops into more profitable versions, so the reason why we need crafting to take time is to not break the economy of the raw mats.
---
So you insist on calling me garbage? Well tough shit, you can also eat a dick.
---
"if you want to meme", clearly he didn't name it as a competitive build.
---
Waiting for 5 days already. So i guess not less than that.
---
Sorry about that I will delete my post now. When you want to post something, you only see general rules sadly :/
---
Most GW2's skyboxes and borders could really use some revamp to show a expanse of terrain beyond the map borders when looking over the walls.
---
A few maps do have them, so they are not impossible.  It's usually faded rocks, green hills or dunes that blend with the distance fog.  Hardly ever anything with a high model complexity, and many can be just 2d imposters.  
---
If you want to see a 2d imposter in all of its glory, you can enter the Temple of the Silent Storm arena. If you look far to the south while in the airships, you'd see a large block of ice that appears to be far in the horizon. But it's actually a flat image mid-air, high enough to appear to be far in the horizon. 
---
You can also see faraway scenery done very well inside the Guilded Hollow. Get high over the guild hall and you'd be able to see a large tree in the distance, but more importantly, you'll be able to see faked terrain outside the map. 
---
* Skyboxes that have nothing in their lower areas near the horizon should get something that blends well with stuff behind the walls.
---
* Areas behind low walls should get something that blends with the skybox and the distance fog to make it look like there's something up to the horizon.
---
* Bodies of water are mostly fine, except those close to a newly added map. Those should get something blurry faraway to hint a landmass.
---
Last I checked Guardian is the most popular class. There’s a reason for that, I think.
---
In open world PvE I don’t think it can get smoother as a Dragon Hunter. You have skills to pull towards you, to freeze them in place. You have a lot of sustain. Your main skills (GS2, GS4, traps) let you just hit a couple buttons and it’s high burst kills everything around you.
---
It can get boring and stale, but when I’m doing new content I always bring my Guardian because it lets you coast through content without a care in the world: it’s smooth.
---
You are breathtaking
---
How do I duel people in the PvP lobby arena?
---
I've seen players posting that it was going to happen in "half a year," "six months," "Q3," or "Q4," but none of them linked to a source when asked.  So you probably saw players say December, and not Anet.
---
Have fun in WoW.
---
There is a search function. This question gets asked about ever 5 minutes.
---
 this image I found it on a group of guild wars 2 on facebook
---
You can get the mount early if someone at 80 is willing to help you. Same for the glider.
---
That's Exactly the type of answer I was hoping to get! My logic is the same, if a class is very popular, there has to be a reason!
---
Guardian appeals a lot to me, maybe even more the Firebrand spec. Can it be compared to the DragonHunter or they are completely different roles?
---
guardian-&gt;firebrand has very nice heals. I personally think firebrand heals more than druid, but people in raids like druid better becuase they provide other boons besides healing. I think you'll find more satisfaction healing small groups or your own party than in a meta-focused raid group. 
---
My opinion is definitely biased, because to me, PUG raiding is not as enjoyable as raiding with friends, but the main source of helpfulness you get on this game is helping new players rather than experienced ones since they can usually hold their own.
---
I guess it depends on what you meant by "smooth."
---
Personally, I do think Mesmers is a good candidate for that kind of adjective. I think warriors fit it fairly well also, and thieves. Maybe also Engineer. They can be complicated, but their complexity is partly due to large amounts of skills which also also them to pretty fluidly weave them together in my experience (that said they start out as probably the least "smooth").
---
The griffon is more versatile and faster. You will use it more often than any other mount.
---
And cool
---
Firebrand is my favourite spec. I keep a 2 sets of gear on my guardian so I can swap back and forth. It's smooth as well, but in open world you have a little less health so you can't just run and never stop - you need to be mindful of your health sometimes. I find it more fun, because you get tomes to play with, but being less brain dead than DH it's not as smooth when you just want to crush content. 
---
A popular build right now is to use the firebrand spec with more or less the dragon hunter mindset. You trade in your traps for buffs.
---
What do you mean by "they start out"? Levelling experience?
---
Learn to take better pictures Jesus. You can’t see crap in this photo.
---
It's all a rip-off, save your money. Or, if you must, buy the packs with five skins in them.
---
I want rangers with greatshield focusing on condition application by blocking attacks. Instead of a single pet they would get swarm of insects or jellyfish. Based on the order, the would change Form. Condi bunker ftw
---
1) Read the different builds on Metabattle and especially, read why a skill/ rune/ amulet is used. Then, check the enemy team composition when you load into a map. If a certain rune or amulet is recommended against condi, and you see two necros on the enemy team, you might want to switch to that. There are some great builds on that site, and a lot of experienced players help with that, but those players aren't you. You might do a lot better with the secondary amulet/ rune choice, and not the primary one.
---
2) Play different builds of your class, too. Spend some time in the free-for-all arena in the lobby. 
---
3) After you have ten or twenty games under your belt, try a different class, one that you're already comfortable with in PVE/ WVW. Set the build, run around and fight other players, make some changes to it. I had my best season last month with my fifth class in PVP. (I've only been playing this mode for a year.) Even though my current class (Scrapper) is quite possibly my favorite, I'm going to try at least one new one this season.
---
4) You don't have to have a PVP guild, but they are usually great sources of information. You can also ask people playing your class if you see them in the lobby or on your team. Discord or chat also helps, since players will say why they're doing something, not just running off and doing it.
---
Try submitting a support ticket and see if you can get a refund on those reset items. It's a long shot but you've got nothing to lose.
---
Oh yes. The Maguma burl? Did I spell it right?
---
Sorry, some people don't know how to communicate politely. It's as thought it physically harms them to see a repeat thread (though amusingly they don't have any trouble repeating the same comment that was already posted harassing you).
---
Sarcastic comments aside, if you plan on ever buying gems then the Ultimate is pretty good.
---
The problem is I'm already stick on how the scourge performs. I just don't want to blame myself on spending golds for gears then thinking "the scourge is really better". I'm sorry but that's the reason why I can't do it with Reaper. My mind is already telling me "not the Reaper".
---
3 things can happen to change stats in gear: 
---
* Stat Swap: Legendary gear can freely select stats from all the stats available in all the content you own without affecting the rest of the properties of the item. 
---
 * This is the only gear that can do this. 
---
* Stat Reset: Items that can select stats once and remain fixed after that may get a stat reset after certain updates that change the list of stats they can have. 
---
 * Stat resets remove the selected stats and allow selecting new ones. 
---
 * Currently there's no way to do Stat Resets on demand. But it's possible to contact support if you pick the wrong stats in an item that can't be obtaind again or is very expensive, and also that can't either stat swap or be reforged. 
---
* Reforge: Most ascended weapon and armor, and some trinkets, can be Reforged.
---
 * Reforging destroys the original item and gives a new one. And in the process all upgrades in the item that were not safely extracted before the Reforge are destroyed.  
---
 * Reforging ascended weapons and armor results in an item with fixed stats based on the insignia/inscription used.
---
 * Some ascended trinkets and Caladbolg can be reforged by using an item . This gives a new copy of the original item before selecting stats, and that allows you to select the different stats in the new item.
---
 * Infusions with +9 agony and +5 to an attribute also have recipes to reforge them. 
---
I don't like calling reforging "Stat swap" or "stat reset" since it destroys the original item and upgrades in it, and I prefer to keep the names separate so people do not get confused and destroy their items by reforging them while thinking they are actually getting a stat swap.
---
While Everquest is an option, CoH has seen a pretty massive resurgence in terms of concurrent players, and the teams behind the servers are actually releasing updates and actively doing events.  Last weekend (if memory serves) the Homecoming servers had a major server raid and costume contest, as well as a duel between two of the admins for the lulz.
---
I don't need it... I don't need it... :-D
---
It is incredibly unreasonable to expect that you will not have anything spoiled for you if you're going to wander through a community dedicated to talking about a game when you are years behind on story.  New players can easily get the help they need by looking at the stickied posts and asking in game.
---
Also, if the "time/financial commitment" is truly what's stopping someone from catching up on maaaaaybe twenty hours of content, they obviously don't have the time to waste on Reddit either.
---
 why you already have it in play :-P
---
No there is no logs for arenas and people have a point that using them to 'practice' fights is not that great because of how different pve and wvw balance is. My guilds only used them for explaining strategies, classes and other theory stuff but very rarely if ever for actual fights practice, in my opinion its just best to scrim with other guilds as much as possible :P
---
But irl:-)
---
so many members and no EU guild? well, i'll keep an eye out.
---
There's a waypoint in the southwest part of the Heart of the Mists lobby called "Arena Waypoint." If you're above the 'pit' of the arena, you can watch people fight. If you jump down, everyone becomes an enemy combatant. You can ask people in say/ whisper chat if they want to duel, or just fight in the random fights that break out there. To get out, you can run through the shimmery gate at the west end, or hit your special action key. (That key kills you, but you can then waypoint back to the Arena Waypoint.)
---
You can show it :D I want to see it
---
Stealing gives you quickness and 200 power+precision from the Deadeye trait Be Quick or Be Killed (and other boons from trickery line). Activating the stolen skill at 5 malice gives you stealth for a free Death's Judgement.
---
I'm not 100% sure if I get what you're asking, are you only interested in **condi** quickbrand? It's not really a thing in fractals. [**Power** quickbrand](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) is definitely a thing though.  
---
There are pure condi dps firebrand builds for Fractals but personally I find it only really good on fights that have **a lot** of mobs that need to be cleaved. Siren's Reef the best example. In terms of the build, reference [the SC build](https://www.snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) or metabattle.
---
What is a "control" build? CC? Boonstrip?
---
Because thats already a thing with hybrid ren and banner support.
---
This is actually a 3D render made by one of my Guild Leaders, u/PewpewKaplow of Tiny.
---
I'm 100% sure. It wouldn't make sense to put it this way otherwise.
---
I never said it's Not subjective, on the contrary, I gave examples of classes that people often say are not good but that are still loved by some players.
---
My question can be resumed in: What are the most popular classes, since their popularity has to be given to the fact that the majority of people find them more enjoyable than the others?
---
Easy= reaper (Pve)
---
Adaptive= Guardian (all game modes)
---
Skills flow, mobile skills = daredevil, sword weaver (PVE, Pvp depending on player skill).
---
Those of course, are based on my preferences.
---
They wanted to do that with legendaries, as you can see with the collections for the first few gen 2 legendaries, but then it became clear that it is too much work. They opted for a flavourless copy paste crafting system instead, so give the community what they want (legendaries) without having to spent as much resources. I dream that with the refocus on GW2 they can go back to making cool collections for lgegendaries (C'n'C collection is probably one of the best bits of contents in the game), but I doubt it will happen.
---
I want it to be a Skrittcopter with a long series of interconnected Skritt.
---
Well then personally I think that's a bad policy. Spoiler tagging is really simple and I don't understand what the arguments against it are. If someone comes across a spoiler in the comments of a post then that's one thing, but this was on the front page of the sub.
---
Regarding the commitment, you're ignoring the fact that it would cost a new player probably around $80 to catch up on both expansions and the Living World stories. That's a lot for some people to spend on a game. Again, I'm just not sure why you would want to make this sub less friendly to new players or even older/returning players who haven't had a chance to catch up on every aspect of the story.
---
I feel like there isn't really an objective answer here.
---
I find condition Renegade pretty smooth, but I know some others don't share that opinion of it. Meanwhile, I struggle with Berserker (the spec, not the stat) builds whereas others find them very smooth. 
---
...Dragonhunter is pretty smooth, overall, I'd say, and classes with simpler rotations like Condition Soulbeast and Power Daredevil can be smooth through their simplicity. 
---
Support builds can be smooth too I guess, I find Druid very smooth compared to something like Chrono or Firebrand. 
---
This, however, is all subjective.
---
Didn't look special enough to be a boss imo.
---
&gt; My question can be resumed in: What are the most popular classes, since their popularity has to be given to the fact that the majority of people find them more enjoyable than the others?
---
This definitely feels like a different question than the one posed in your OP, then.
---
I'd say Guardian, Elementalist, and Ranger are probably the most popular unless something has changed in the last six months or so.
---
Take a look.
---
Fair point.
---
Ritualist
---
I'm a bit confused by the spear suggestions, I doubt anyone wants a spec with new underwater wep, so would it be the only one that is transitioned to use on land?
---
Well I tried to give a background to my reasoning of Smooth gameplay, seems like I failed.
---
Thanks for the response tho!
---
Would have taken you far less time to just answer his question the first time around, instead of being difficult.   
---
How dare he ask a quick question in the question thread, right?
---
&gt; its not technically faster if you have multiple chars. as in, its still taking the same hours
---
From an absolute point of view it is faster. Sure, it may take the same hours, but you are able to get them all in one day and continue with your next step, instead of waiting. 
---
It's the same amount of work, you have to put in, but having to wait for the next day 2, 3, 4 times takes time. Even if it's only waiting time, it still takes time. Getting your currencies in one day instead of one day of playing plus 2 days waiting -&gt; 3 days, the one day *is* faster. 
---
&gt; Also you must be luckier with the nodes than I've been, no way I even got close to 35 from nodes.
---
The nodes aren't capped by the actual nodes you gather, but by the currencies you get. So if you don't get your ~35 currencies after your node run, you can just start again on another map (or with anotehr char) until nodes disappear. 
---
However, the caps are different from map to map of course. 
---
Kralkatit can only be gathered from meteors, that's capped at 750 Kralkatit per day. 
---
Diflourite Ore is capped somewhere around 70 per day. Wiki doesn't have any info and I never took a closer look, but I was always able to get 70+ only from nodes. 
---
Kournan Supply Caches actually *are* capped by a number of 25, but you always get minimum 1 inscribed shard out of it. So you end up with 25 or more per say. 
---
And there are also 22 Kournan Chests on the map with also 1 guaranteed drop. So you end up with 47 or more Inscribes Shards per day.
---
For Branded Mass Wiki say it's (also) capped by 25 nodes, I think this is one of the hardest ones. 
---
I don't know the cap for Mistonium nodes, but there are also Caches like the Kournan ones, Mist-Touches Caches, that also gives 1 guaranteed Mistonium. 
---
&gt; and the meta gives 20? I've been lucky to get 11 map currency from the meta.
---
Like I said, it's different from map to map. 
---
Istan gives you 15 for Palawadan, 15 for GH and 15 for the Alehound Captain.
---
So it's 45 per char, if you do each once.
---
Sandswept gives you 5 for Zohaqan, 5 for Simulacrum, 1 for Simulacrum pre event, 3 for Dominus Crystallum, 3 for Mark III Golem and 3 for the Beetle Queen.
---
So it's 20 per char, if you do each once.
---
Kourna meta was about 15 iIrc. But you can repeat it as often as you want, even with the same char. 
---
Jahai Bluffs gives 5 for Shatterer, 5 for Branded Djinn, 5 for "Joko" Event, 5 for each unique rift event -&gt; 5 rift events. 
---
So it's 40 per char, if you do each once.
---
Thunderhead again is the hardest one, you only get 5 from north and 5 from south meta. It's also per account, so you can't do it with multiple chars.
---
First of all, the question is flawed because different classes are smoother in different content. 
---
What's the smoothest PvP class? WvW class? PvE class?  But it doesn't end there.
---
Some classes are great at roaming in WvW, but less use in a zerg and vice versa. There's no one class that's the best at every aspect of the game.
---
People who want survivability in open world PvE often go for necros, but I find them dull, even though they're undeniably popular. But they're not the most efficient class to play, just the most survivable one. Several classes can kill faster, but with more risk. 
---
It's just an impossible question.
---
Firebrand is kind of the same but instead of traps and you have tomes to give quickness / might and have the options of more healing and defensive boon options, maybe not quite as good for totally solo
---
That's a really good idea. I was thinking they should make crafting completely account-wide but I cold not come up with an adequate compensation for those who bought crafting licenses.
---
If they added crafting queuing, we could actually have something to replace the effects of crafting licenses, and keep them a tempting purchase even if crafting becomes fully account-wide.
---
So it could be like this:
---
* Crafting becomes completely account wide. 
---
 * Discovered recipes, the only recipes that didn't become account-wide, become account-wide too. 
---
* Queue slots are added to crafting.
---
 * Each queue slot will allow you to have a queued task in a new tab in crafting stations. This tab will remain between crafting stations, allowing you to craft multiple items from multiple disciplines.  
---
 * Crafting will no longer be cancelled when moving, instead it will be 10 times slower while away from a station. The items crafted will be received the next time you use a crafting station. 
---
 * Crafting with a panel open will be faster.  
---
 * Players start with 5 free queue slots.
---
* The bonuses given by Crafting Licenses would change to compensate all disciplines being account-wide. The number of crafting licenses available will increase to a max of 10.  Every crafting license will give:
---
 * +1 queue slot, up to 10 with the max 10 crafting licenses, for a total of 15. 
---
 * +5% queued crafting speed, up to a total of 50%.
---
 * Bonus experience from crafting. This experience will be earned even if the recipe is gray and gives no normal experience. The formula could be something like this: 
---
     * 0.1% of the exp required to next level/spirit shard * (Crafting level of the recipe/100). 
---
     * Up to a max of 1% to next level * (recipe level/100).
---
 * +0.5 chance for critical crafting success. Up to a max 5%.
---
It's very obviously a 3D render.
---
What you're talking about is completely different than this post though. I completely agree with you that if someone goes wandering through the comments here and has something spoiled, that's on them. This is literally the top post on the front page right now and I don't think its unreasonable to ask for a spoiler tag on an actual screenshot of a major spoiler
---
Thx was hoping lower would also be good but alas then :P
---
The cooldown def was a problem, If you execute people with 1 skill u dont get in combat
---
could clear fight if u you use that smartly
---
That is entirely possible. Damn am I gullable? Lol thanks man
---
Rotation-wise, I'd say [Fresh Air Sword Weaver](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/). It loops nicely, the animations and transitions are fluid and, on top of everything, you're dealing a crazy amount of damage. I find it really enjoyable to play.
---
Maybe I should just make a separate post at this point, but I just think there has to be some kind of room for compromise between "every allusion to the story needs to be tagged" and "screenshot of a major plot spoiler on the front page".
---
Very informative &amp; helpful. Great vid layout, thanks for sharing.
---
And this all happened a bit before the release of the end of season 4, secretly the API is connected to Kralkatorik and now that he is death, so is our API.... or is the API corrupted by a new dragon?...!
---
Oh wow, that I didnt know!
---
And uh what competition was this, sry I dont keep up with all of them.
---
Yeah sure, but the problem I have with passive condition removal is you cannot help when you get condi bomb like when Slothosar shake and it's at those moment you really need those condition removal. Not when someone have 3 poison because he step a bit in the poison area.
---
Because it isn't a hub?
---
Depending on the boss, people move around. Literally as the picture above, Bandit Trio, people move around. I'd just like an indicator on how my babies are doing.
---
&gt; As far as the elite specializations go, would it be worth getting HoT purely to get some? As far as i'm aware, most of what i want from the expansions i could get from just buying PoF 
---
Most people here will recommend that you eventually get both xpacs (we're GW2 fans after all). So would I, but it's totally okay to start with just Path of Fire first. It's true that the mounts will be 10 times more useful to you while leveling than gliding would be.
---
&gt; it makes me wonder if it would be a good idea to boost one character to level 80 just to unlock mounts and potentialy autoloot for all characters. I've heard people say mixed things about this, saying that it can hurt the experience of someone who hasn't played the game "normally" yet, since it wasn't designed for mounts, but some said it's a huge convenience and honestly i hate walking around in this game. 
---
If you hate walking in game, I highly recommend that you boost a character and unlock the raptor mount. Alternatively, you could find a level 80 friend to group up with you and start the PoF quest; as long as you're in his group, you will also get the raptor even if you're not yet level 80.
---
Honestly, I think that some of us say that mounts "spoil" the core Tyria experience because we had to play for years without them. But truly mounts make the game so much more enjoyable to me.
---
&gt; Lastly, how exactly does the revenant play? 
---
Revs can fill a lot of different roles, including support, power, and condi. They are especially great in WvW. You can test out any class in either the Silverwastes or in PvP before committing to using your boost, so try it out and see if you like it!
---
We don't even know *if* we will get more elite specs, let alone what they will be about.
---
Please remove spirits from being prioritzed for boons and barriers thank you.
---
This game truly needs content like this. It's why I felt so, so happy when they introduced Sun's Refuge. Generally, I think episode 4 was the one that kept people entertained the longest this season, and the Sun's Refuge collections added a lot of meat to the bones. 
---
Think of it, next time, they could just instantly introduce the instance and update it with collections across the entire season!  
---
Please add a new Sun's Refuge style instance with season 5, ArenaNet. I would be so happy.
---
- Hammer Ranger (bunnythumper) with Skelk combo field pets on low cooldowns (so that ranger weapon + pet get some inherent synergy)
---
- Mace(s) Thief (Brawler), loses access stealth altogether, gains shouts, Support/Tank role.
---
- ranged mace Engineer (since scepter is a caster weapon) with golemites (if only scrapper didnt have them already these would be wells)
---
- Scepter Revenant with wells and uh, clones (Razah Rt/Mesmer) _(after Renegade spirit tweaks to function more like Ranger Spirits, with their flip over skills being better effects)_
---
- pistol(s) Warrior (Corsair) with tricks.
---
- offhand dagger Guardian (Blood Knight) with corruption skills  condi heavy, nerf/buffing firebrand into the support role it already fills)
---
- dagger mesmer, loses clones (shattered phantasms fill shroud energy bar for a mist/bloodstone-shroud with new abilities (think white mantle elementalist)
---
- Pistol elementalist (Alchemist) elemental spirit weapons as their utility
---
- Mace Necromancer, (Judge) healing and support role (would require some group support removal from Scourge), mace functions somewhat like a guardian's, focuses on weakness/vulnerability on enemies and protection/barrier to allies. So a power/support hybrid.
---
If WvW is your main aim you might want to move to a better server for it. TC has a history of being very bad in WvW. Their groups are friendly but known to get farmed by almost all other servers.
---
The collection was ABSOLUTE TRASH and a prime example of the LEAST FUN types of content ever to exist in this game. the game has a great engaging combat system but nope LETS RUN AROUND LIKE IDIOTS PRESSING F on things and grinding HEARTS (aka everyone's least favorite thing in the game)
---
A good "long term" goal is something like legendary armor, that requires dedication and skill to raid. Doing a boring grocery list acting like a degenerate RPer playing pet simulator is not fun and is not content. It's filler nonsense that forces people to log in to artificially inflate the numbers of their dying game without actually making any engaging or repeatable content
---
They’ve hinted at delivering expansion-worthy features through LS5.
---
First of all i'm not on f2p, i have the core game. Secondly as i mentioned i don't mind biased opinions as long as i get the reasoning behind them, like sure i know most people here obviously think it's worth it but i want to know what makes it worth it and if it's worth it for every type of player. As for the rudeness that's a bit of a shame, i remember i had very good experiences with interacting with the community back when i first played it and i remember people being very friendly whenever i needed advice. Hopefully things haven't changed this drastically.
---
Yeee i've heard a lot of people saying that's where the real meat of the game is, although i've heard a lot others saying it's fun to level to 80 aswell, specially on your first character. Regardless, how much work is it to get the mounts? I heard at least the very first one you just have to do one quest.
---
When I read stuff like this I feel like I am on crazy pills
---
like how could anyone possibly think anything about that collection was fun? It was easily the worst, most unenjoyable thing I've ever had to do in the game. Not a single step of that process was fun and all I could think about the whole time was how badly I wanted it to be over so I could quit the game again
---
I doubt they mean elite specs but I'll happily be proven wrong
---
You couldve played minecraft in browser while raiding mate
---
More content, is that good enough?
---
Ohh I love the trap idea!
---
I doubt that, I imagine they'll do an expansion after in which case they'll have to do back to back elite specs.
---
Gonna answer your questions in order, and based on my opinion so you will hear other opinions and I highly recommend forming your own, if it isn't fun, why bother?
---
1. I'd say for a lot of MMO's out there, this is the best "starter" MMORPG. The community is incredibly friendly, helpful, as well as a lot of stuff is account bound rather than character bound so you have time to pick which class/race you like the most instead of feeling locked into one. Solo content, and even some harder stuff like endgame dungeons (called Fractals) can be done with random players and is still enjoyable. The story is all solo-able but can be fun with friends. It's also one of those games that focuses on horizontal progression instead of vertical, so you can play for a year, get the best gear, all the pretty visuals, leave for a year, come back, and everything you have is still usable, or in the very least, minimal changes. Compared to games like WoW, where if you leave for a even a day, you're already behind. 
---
2. If you aren't sure about the game, don't spend your money. The base game is free, with minimal limitations on things like trading post activities, but you can play all the way up to max level, and the entire story. If you manage to hit 80, and don't like it, then stop there, and all you've wasted is a few hours of time. If you like it however, the expansions make the game a ton more fun. The reason why I say wait til you've leveled to 80 is because all expansion content is locked until you hit max level, so there's no point in buying them until you can actually play them.
---
3. Use the boosters, don't use them, they're essentially time savers but the lower levels always go by quicker than the higher levels. As for "leaving your friends behind" that doesn't happen in GW2. If you join them in a low level map, you will be scaled down to the level of the area, but you will still get experience and can map complete and do it all, the game is very friendly like that, plus even if you hit 80 before they do, there is no vertical progression, so the "catch up" for them is to hit 80.
---
4. The Rev is fun, but tricky to play, especially for new or returning players. Most people I talk to who try it right off the bat are intimidated by the way the energy system works as well as the 6-0 skill swapping instead of just the 1-5 skill swapping while in combat. It was kinda made with the elite specs in mind, but you need the expansions in order to play it anyways. Which, and I'll say it again, don't spend any money until you are for sure down to play it. Try playing other classes first to get a hang of the weapon swapping, F1-5 skills, and dodging. Warrior, Ranger, and Necromancer are gonna be the most forgiving classes, especially while leveling and when doing solo content like the story.
---
Last thing I'm gonna say is we have a weekly question thread for things like this so the sub doesn't get spammed with question threads. Try there, a ton of people sit there ready to answer, and if you think this sub is helpful, try asking map chat for help if you're stuck or lost, 99.9999999% of the time you'll get a handful of people willing to help.
---
The raptor mount takes about 10 minutes. You don't even have to be level 80 -- as long as your own PoF, you can group up with a level 80 friend and do the quest to unlock the raptor together.
---
The springer, skimmer, and jackal will take an additional 2-4 hours each, more or less. The PoF content is some of my favorite, especially for someone like you who doesn't play MMOs much. It has great story content and world design.

&gt; # 06/11/2019—June 11 Release Notes
---
&gt;## Destabilized Magic
---
&gt;The Mystic Forge skritt want to help defeat Qadim by providing adventurers with new &amp;quot;shinies,&amp;quot; helping them look their best while battling this dangerous foe. Of course, nothing in life is ever free. Qadim&amp;#39;s destabilization of magic has resulted in daily ley-line nodes briefly forming near the remnants of world bosses. Gather condensed ley-line essence from these nodes, along with a few other materials, and combine them in the Mystic Forge to create these shiny new weapons.
---
&gt;- This event runs from 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on June 11 to 1:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on June 25. After this time period, condensed ley-line essence can be purchased with gaeting crystals from Glenna in Ahdashim or from the Magnetite Exchange Operative in the Lion&amp;#39;s Arch Aerodrome.
---
&gt;- Combine Condensed Ley-Line Essences, Charged Cores, Elder Wood Logs, and Quartz Crystals in the Mystic Forge to create Shiny and Ultra Shiny weapons.
---
&gt;- Collect all of the weapons to earn the Ultra Shiny title!
---
&gt;## Living World
---
&gt;### Skyscale
---
&gt;- Improved behavior when mounting the skyscale in midair after using updrafts and other traversal abilities.
---
&gt;- The skyscale will no longer enter the wall-cling state when hitting a wall if it is descending using the Mount Ability 2 key.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which the skyscale could continue playing its wall-cling animation after using a waypoint.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which the skyscale&amp;#39;s energy-gain rate could be higher than intended after mounting in midair.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that prevented skyscales from blinking.
---
&gt;### Bug Fixes
---
&gt;- War Eternal: Fixed an issue in which Aurene would fail to appear at the beginning of the Descent instance for some players.
---
&gt;## World Polish
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect objective text to appear in the &amp;quot;Defeat Ysshi Hessani and Pek Rakt Grag&amp;quot; event in the Domain of Vabbi.
---
&gt;- Reduced the time Augury Rock is open by 10 minutes, shortening the wait for the &amp;quot;Disperse the wild magic that escaped from Augury Rock&amp;quot; event in Elon Riverlands.
---
&gt;## General
---
&gt;- The Mute Player Alerts sound option will now mute the alert chime accompanying some targeted skills (mostly found in raids and story instances) and the alert chime that accompanies the application of many special action skills.
---
&gt;## Raids
---
&gt;### The Hidden City of Ahdashim
---
&gt;After the events in the Mystic Forge, Qadim has returned home to the Hidden City of Ahdashim to usurp a great power. Find the Key and the cardinals for guidance into the hallowed city walls, and save not just the djinn but the entire world from Qadim&amp;#39;s master scheme.
---
&gt;## Items
---
&gt;- A new item, the Spirit Banner, is available from the Mystic Forge in exchange for 50 Spirit Shards.
---
&gt;- Various WvW blueprint denominations have been removed from the Mystic Forge, as those multiples were made obsolete by the ability to select how many players wish to purchase.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which some ascended raid reward containers did not stack.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which Exquisite Serpentite Jewels did not have attribute text.
---
&gt;## BLACK LION TRADING COMPANY GEM STORE
---
&gt;### New Items and Promotions
---
&gt;- The new Shimmerwing Skyscale Skin is available in the Style category of the Gem Store for 2,000 gems.
---
&gt;- The new Skyscale Hatchling Mining Tool with the Glyph of Alchemy is now available in the Utility category of the Gem Store for 1,000 gems.
---
&gt;- For a limited time, the Crystalline Dragon Wings Backpack Glider Combo returns to the Style category of the Gem Store for 700 gems.
---
&gt;- Fixed some texture stretching on the Skyscale Chair.
---
Just to clarify, a player with PoF but not HoT can still unlock autoloot. Autoloot is not a HoT-exclusive feature.
---
It comes down to personal preference, but IMO, no, don't do it. The base game was made to be explored without gliders or mounts in mind, plus it'll really make the world feel alive if you go in order. 
---
Also, if you end up not liking the game at all, I know I would feel better not spending any money on it. Wait til you're level 80 and for sure want to continue.
---
that's an amazing addition
---
Moses parted the sea to save his people from the Egyptian Army.
---
Far from it. I am a Brit with a typical South London accent, I am an accountant for the NHS in the UK
---
You could buy the timegated parts, unless that was something they added afterwards, just not the daily reset timegates
---
Gotta say, bit disappointed there's only one Skyscale skin, and a 2k gem premium one at that.  And while it looks pretty cool, it's also not going to fit a lot of people's aesthetics.  I sure hope they have more stuff on the way for it.  I just want more dye channels :(
---
Awesome, I've been secretly hoping for somehting like this for a long time.
---
Thanks!
---
holy shit i need to be all about this!!
---
i've been struggling trying to make reliable gold to work on my first legendary (almost done with 2nd step collection for Zap!!), was looking around for a SW farming guild or group.
---
:D!
---
There's a video on the official site:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH-YatlOoFU
---
Uhm, would've been cooler if it were more of an actual butterfly IMO.
---
As you said, "sure you could go crazy with triple healer tempest, scourge, firebrand for the ultimate facetanking experience but that's a huge trade-off"
---
Bringing a control build is still a trade-off. A player that is stat with Aggression and Denial will do as much damage as a healer would.
---
See when I tried so hard to get a dragon
---
I didn’t mean I wanted a moth...... 
---
Mehhhhh
---
But my squad can still see it, right?
---
Anyone able to take pics of the new weapons?
---
424MB
---
That's your problem and your answer.
---
Get to 80, and then all of them rely on skill.
---
Don't worry Anet's gradually working on that
---
What classes have you tried and how far did you get? GW2 has been tough for me to get in for somewhat similar reasons. You need to get far enough in the game to start playing with your specializations. It'll give you more options.  
---
I could believe you're talking about not having anything else to do since everything is on cooldown and you're still in combat. You could aim at builds that involve weapon recharge speed, Essentially giving you more buttons to press, more often.
---
Thank you good sir
---
Need an "Ayin" too :P
---
Pics
---
what
---
It does. all the time
---
You can pop into the pvp lobby and try out the class skills as they would be at 80 if you want.
---
Unique weapons are a nice idea, but practically speaking they would be a massive amount of work to implement, so I wouldn't consider them something particularly likely to happen. In broad terms, all I really want from Elite Specs is for them to continue expanding the roles a given class can fill in interesting ways, ideally without stepping on the toes of any existing Specs. I also wouldn't mind getting a new set with LWS5, seeing as we won't be seeing a new expansion for some time.
---
Oh that's so pretty :0 need to hurry up and unlock it now!!
---
Exit Invisiman, enter Invisicommander
---
Yes i did this aswell for all of them

&gt;### Shimmerwing Skyscale Skin

---
&gt;Your fashion star will rise with the new Shimmerwing Skyscale Skin. With a perfect combination of regal demeanor, fearsome claws, and wings with a luster that’s beyond compare, it’s a must-have for any mount collection.
---
&gt;### Skyscale Hatchling Mining Tool

---
&gt;This baby skyscale changes the game when it comes to mining ore. At your command, your tiny winged helper will hover near a mining node and spit a blast of fire at it.
---
&gt;Despite its small stature, this baby’s flame burns hot, so don’t be surprised when all that heat smelts ore into a better quality material: the tool comes equipped with a Glyph of Alchemy, which replaces gathering results with materials used in higher-level crafting recipes. Material types are determined by the type of node gathered from. Mithril ore, elder wood, and select cooking ingredients can be improved a limited number of times each day.
---

&gt; 
---
&gt; the Spirit Banner,
---
Looks like it's an actual banner that gives a +10% to karma, magic find and gold from kills.
---
Not a bad spirit shard sink IMO.
---
Control build is just offensive protection. Like how using protection lowers incoming damage, you use CC skills to lower outgoing enemy damage directly by weakening the enemy. Similar to how Confusion and Retaliation works. Confusion damages the enemy when he uses skills, Retaliation damages enemies when he hit a party member. 
---
Breakbar gives a limit on how useful CC becomes. I would've liked to be able to stunlock a boss to death, but that is OP. So, Megaweakness is the CC that allows control builds to be useful.
---
What do you mean by "useful" skills here, exactly?
---
It look really cool tbh
---
whats it for though?  Is it an equipable or an item/ingredient?
---
Oooh Shiny !
---
Its a 10% goldfind + 10% magic find banner
---
Aurora changed to what we believed to be the 3 legendary jewelry animation.
---
Fair warning to those interested in buying the new skyscale skin regarding how it dyes; akin to base models having sometimes that "red outline" this new skin has a purple one. Even if you dye it fully shadow abyss.
---
You can see what I mean via [this pic here](https://i.imgur.com/YHjZHyz.jpg)
---
Pretty skin, gonna be a bit tricky to dye since it interacts weirdly with dyes. Enjoy.
---
Looks like the legendary trinkets are even more cancerous to look at now. 
---
Please give us a disable effects button for auras, backpacks, legendary accessories. Please!
---
They have also managed to bug Aurora+Vision into looking like Coalescence.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/j4gQ6Ku](https://imgur.com/a/j4gQ6Ku) 
---
The moon/black thing actually goes directly over my head and the white trails manage to add to the effect... just enough so that it is nearly impossible to see half the skills you're using. Lol.
---
The prec + aurora + vision triggers it. Just tested by moving my prec from alt.
---
Let's hope not, considering it's a downgrade effect...and imo, really bad.
---
Skyscale wing is designed really well, but it's not something I'm interested in.  What I am excited about is all the additional elements on it (the spawn animation, the colored flame breath).  Makes me hype for the other skins we will get for the skyscale.
---
no it doesn't. they have priority along with other summons. if other players are in range, skills will prioritize them first
---
[Yes.](https://i.imgur.com/0rDw53o.jpg)
---
Yes, I agree. I wished all along that I didn’t have to rely on an external guide, but I did.
---
this has always been the case
---
it's why you have to be careful where you place them during the halloween event
---
It's mostly because you're low level.
---
A lot of the levelling combat is quite simplistic (i.e. auto attack spam) and frankly, boring.
---
Stick it out a bit if you can, and you will find every profession (apart from maybe 1 niche spec of 1 class in one meta build) relies a lot more on skill rotations and a variety of skills to play effectively.
---
Pretty sure you can make it look like more rough and strong one if you dye it well. Haven't tried it tho but i think it has potential.
---
I've got that as well, and unequipping Aurora doesn't remove its aura.
---
A lot of 2000 gem skins end up "pretty/elegant" though. They sell well. I see more of the Sun Temple Gecko around than the Summit Wildhorn for Springer, likewise I see more of the Magnificent Hummingbird than the Umbral Demon Skimmer skins, and yet again I see plenty more Shrine Guardian than I do Reforged Warhound Jackals roaming about.
---
I think there will be a more "badass" skin at a future point, but as far as a skin that really changes the feel of the base mount, I think they hit the mark here.
---
Excellent change, perfect for WvW
---
I'm not sure if I like that feature existing in PvE.
---
Oh my god this is a miracle for roleplayers. I've ran events and had so many randos swarming us and asking about events...it got annoying after the tenth one.
---
yes! just tested it. AMAZING.
---
It has a purple/pink tint to it. I'll pass on this skin. Never was a fan of butterfly mounts.
---
''Skily''..when you're excited too much. But damn, this is very cool!
---
YES \\o/  
---
OMG I'm going to run tag forever now, finally, after years.

Change to only 2 Endurnace Bars.

Put back original jump distance.

2nd Mastery adds the evade on jump. 
---
Dismounts other players in area with Engage skill. 
---
Done.
---
Its bugged af, now I have aurora effect without any of them.
---
If its body then like the glider I will dye it like spyro
---
Okay, just to unconfuse myself there are 3 legendary trinket effects. We'll call them effect 1 for old single trinket effect. Effect 2 for old double trinket effect. And effect 3 for old double trinket plus clones effect.
---
So, right now 2 trinkets is effect 3. 1 trinket is effect 2. And no trinkets on for me is effect 1. For clones, while having 2 trinkets on they show the old effect 2, with one trinket on they show effect 2 and with no trinkets on they show no effect.
---
conditempest doesn't uses autoattack, or barely. All damage comes from burning.
---
Engi, ele and mesmer.
---
How do you feel about the miniatures then?
---
From what I've dabbled with, lighter colors suit this skin way more. You can literally dye it white and it's fine. As soon as you start to go darker that's when you notice the outline glow especially on the wings more so.
---
Also yes, so much purple this LS haha.
---
Yeah, guess so. Well, back to basically not playing this game till next patch notes in the hopes that WvW/PvP gets something done about the power creep.

---
Not a fan of the black goop thing inside the middle bubble.
---
any side comparison to original skyscale? Is it really the wings bigger, or just the body is slim?
---
I'm not sure I like it. Perhaps in a very different color combination?
---
Was really looking forward to that branded-style concept art they showed off on guild chat. However, I think it's great that the skyscale got its own prestige 2k skin. So far I was expecting it to get just one small set of skins like the warclaw (which doesn't have a 2k skin) but now I'm very optimistic that we'll get a lot of skins in future mount licenses!
---
That mining tool is adorable and probably the first gathering tool I'd consider getting for just the animation. I'm confused by the specifics of how the glyph works though:
---
&gt; the tool comes equipped with a Glyph of Alchemy, which replaces gathering results with materials used in higher-level crafting recipes. Material types are determined by the type of node gathered from. Mithril ore, elder wood, and select cooking ingredients can be improved a limited number of times each day. 
---
I get that if I mine copper ore, I'll instead get iron ore. I get that if I mine mithril ore, I'll instead get orichalcum ore (until an account-wide daily cap, and then I'll just get the normal mithril ore).
---
But what happens if I mine orichalcum ore with it? Surely I won't get the t7 unrefined ore, mithrillium.
---
https://i.imgur.com/SXTdlQl.png It is a karma banner!
---
Will it remember that and your color setting, or you have to do them EACH time?
---
Wings are slightly wider. I'd say like 1/5th? But the wings are taller. They're 3 separate wings (on each side) leafed together. So they look "thicker".
---
Awesome sugggestions, thank you so much for your input!
---
Gives it a sense of iridescence, I'm there for it even though I recognize others might not be

Beautiful, thank you for sharing as I was wondering! Which dye slot affects the flames, if you know offhand?
---
Could you please post a pic with eternal ice/celestial dye?
---
Wat the actual pancake. How is it so hard to make these types of things just dye the color we want. Like why do we even have dyes if we say black and we get purple? ...
---
Fits their wvw playstyle perfectly.
---
exact same for me
---
IIRC the statues only give the exo/rare drops now.
---
Thanks, was about to buy it. x_x
---
now we are talking!
---
Is this skill the same colour regardless of your dyes or does it change?
---
Mesmer is the hardest class to play since the way it plays in PVP, Raids, Fractals, and open world is completely different. However, it always has a competitive build in every game mode and most likely always will. Always near the top of the benchmarks.  
---
Guard is useful in everything. Its not always the optimal class, but it is very easy to play and can do everything on its own while performing a bunch of different roles. FB and DH are top teir in fractals, mid-high teir in raids, and great in open world. FB is mandatory in WvW and plays very well with specific comps in PVP.   
---
I would stay away from Ele and Necro, and thieves as they just don't have a good place in most end game content.
---
Their first choice for a skin for a *dragon* mount is...interesting?
---
\[dP\] killed the first boss
---
[https://imgur.com/a/rDmzsOJ](https://imgur.com/a/rDmzsOJ)
---
* White updrafts = good
---
* Red = bad
---
* Boss will shockwave, you need to use the updrafts to avoid or insta down
---
* His break bar regens really quickly
---
* The longer it's  up, the more stacks of a shield he gets
---
* There's a spread mechanic Like KC
---
*  There's also a safe circle mechanic like Arkk
---
What's wrong with it?
---
If I were to take out an endurance bar Id either remove the territorial speed boost as well or buff their base speed a bit, since you can already keep up with mounted players who arent in their territory. Other than that I love the idea of an aoe dismount, as long as its not "too" large!
---
Shrine Guardian is actually *the* most-bought mount skin in the game, no exceptions. If you sort [the mount unlock stats](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=mounts) on efficiency by descending popularity, Shrine Guardian is the #1 mount unless you count the default skins the mounts come on. It's ahead of even the original Halloween set and the default Skyscale.
---
&gt;That is the first premium gem store mount skin that hasn't been attainable in the BLC
---
No?
---
Lol did they get nerfed again? I haven’t played in 3 weeks
---
So you are forced to have purple? :o
---
it actually is, MF, Gold and Karma all +10%, and stacks with other banners
---
No. I put on a green dye and it changed to red in the light. There's that type of relationship for every dye. While it can be cool, it fucks the colour scheme I have for my character.
---
The whole body has a tint/aura/shimmer like the celestial mount skins that shades it purple/pink when viewed at an angle. It also warps how lots of dyes work, mixing a purple/pink tinge into them.
---
Best mount skin for June.
---
Since I haven't seen anyone mention this - You can buy Prepaid Cards at a place like Best Buy or Gamestop (any larger gaming chain) that he can trade for in-game cosmetics and upgrades for his account.
---
You could get him a $25 or $50 prepaid card and that would go along way to plenty of things he could enjoy in the game!
---
For example:  [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/guild-wars-2000-gems-macwindows-multi/6575597.p?skuId=6575597](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/guild-wars-2000-gems-macwindows-multi/6575597.p?skuId=6575597)
---
Oh really? That's a bit of a shame, cause if i were to buy just one rn it would be PoF considering it's the only one on sale over here. Plus the mounts, of course.
---
You're... not going to find that style of tank in this game, that's for sure.
---
However, I *do* recommend giving boon support another look. You do have important duties, and can often CC (Firebrand has a lot of that and feels tanky in a set of minstrel's).
---
I love tanking on other games, and honestly, you won't get the "Gotta use my defensives as the baddie focuses on me" feeling, but you can get the "oh fuck my allies gotta do the thing" feeling from a boon/support/healer. Scrapper or FB (or even herald) are some suggestions.
---
P.S. You sound like you come from a WoW background. As a former, VERY long-time vet... don't treat this game like that. Raiding isn't your end-all, don't burn yourself out over it. I still don't have a static :^)
---
I can't imagine an elementalist doing more damage with auto-attacks. They are all about stacking skills and rotations.
---
Anet should disable rewards for the whole squad if a kick occurs in the final 30 seconds of a fight
---
Consider also mounts which were unlocked as chest drops (I think the Shrine Guardian was the first, so lots of dusty keys got blown that day). Not all skins since have been in chests.
---
Teapot killed Earth Djinn on stream before dP
---
&gt; I'm shocked no one mentioned how f**cked it is that in NA last relink kept DB and IoJ linked. We're perpetually t4, super fun!
---
I transferred from IoJ pretty recently because of this.  The only reason DB is considered so big / full is because of one guild, VIP? I think.  
---
Whatever guild it is, they have 5 different guilds all with the same tag, and they seem to do WvW as a guild just enough to fuck the server's population rating, but not enough to actually accomplish anything over the span of the match.
---
Apparently they bumped how much AP some of the W6 CM achievements were worth.
---
yea another mesmer gay item...pfff
---
removing it from wvw
---
Thank you so much. :) Yes I feel ready for the challenge but I can always go back to my ranger if I get overwhelmed. xD bunny.1345 is me, on NA.
---
i got a random 10ap added
---
I thought you cant kick while in combat?
---
And when it wakes up, it destroys the other APIs' functionality and consumes way too many resources? Definitely an elder dragon.
---
a new legendary effect suddenly pops up with no change notes, seems like it to me. a while back people speculated this was coalescence when it appeared on mesmer clones
---
I need the skyscale skin. Fuck. Anet whyyyyy
---
If they added that SNIFF SNIFF skill for open world pve then it'd be kinda interesting.
---
You can buy the bag on the TP.
---
When it's wings are expanded it looks like a moth to me.
---
It just seems like they went with a very niche type skin, and not a more mainstream one that would've sold much bettter (in my opinion.)
---
I don't see many people clamoring to buy this skin
---
Why would this be a problem in PvE?
---
Looks like Mizutsune
---
Well, the amount of people I see in-game with the skin already seems to disagree.
---
Seems like that infusion has wings
---
BUY ALL OF THEM!!!!!!! they will spike soon
---
ah figured at first glance they were butchering escort / river / etc
---
You can't kick while in combat.
---
I posted this on a different comment thread, but you might find it useful so I'll copy it here and then expand on it:
---
&gt; I would say GW2 has a "soft" trinity so to speak. There's several forms of end game content (fractals vs raids, for example). Once you get to the higher levels/elitist groups, they'll almost always want DPS players and some sort of heal/support in the group. Tanking is really only relevant to raids, but there are different mechanics that dictate exactly who is the tank. However, that being said, it's definitely flexible, which is I think Anet's primary goal with avoiding a hard trinity. Many classes can get different sets of gear so that they can fit the different roles, and it depends a lot on what your particular group wants. Players have the flexibility to choose the playstyle they like. 
---
The only time you'll get tank mechanics in raids, and it sounds like Tank Chronomancer would be the perfect fit for you. Chronos are your typical tank because not only do they have naturally high defenses (high health), they also have a ton of blocks, distorts, and evades. You won't want to dodge often because the goal of tanking is to keep the boss as still as possible so your DPS can focus on rotations, but being able to time your skills sounds like something you enjoy so that's not a problem. In both Raids and Fractals, Chronos are also responsible for boon uptime (quickness are the main ones), but fractals have a much higher emphasis on this since you don't need to worry about boss aggro.
---
As for "every class can do 25 might", I believe this is inaccurate :o As far as I know, only Druids can keep 25 stack might uptime with virtually no effort, and other support classes like Firebrand, Renegade, and Scourge are able to, but with some difficulty. There's a good chance that you might have been accidentally running double support, which is typically frowned upon in fractals. In fact, some groups go without a healer at all because they're experienced enough to speed-run.
---
&gt;I miss John Smith, he made new items require mats that actually needed a value increase instead of reusing the same materials over, and over, and over again...
---
How do I obtain Globs of Dark Matter? The Wiki says to salvage high level exotic gear with a Black Lion Salvage Kit, which I've been doing. But I'm only getting Globs of Ectoplasm.
---
Because we did the other Djinn first?
---
The minis don't bother me. I would use a mini baby Aurene. Maybe because it's not actual Aurene size. They feel like more of a tribute. BUT that is just my opinion and I'm one in millions. I just couldn't do it though. Would feel like I cheated on her or something lol
---
Pretty, but yeah not for me
---
Power Reaper, Core Warrior, Alacrigade, staff daredevil all kinda rely on autoattacks for their damage. However these classes are the exception. I would suggest  to check out  [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)  to OP if he wants to see "endgame rotations". Their are multiple raid builds for every class, most of them with a video of their rotation (on a golem).
---
Sorry to say but Chrono is the games staple tank because it provides unique support and has weapon skills/utilities that provide the most damage mitigation (blocks/evades/invulnerables). All other classes can technically tank, but their boons aren't as unique and tank by either healing themselves (druid/revenant/Firebrand) or absorbing damage (reaper).
---
I disagree with this, actually :o While it's true for open world (and to some extent, fractals since the tanking mechanic varies from boss to boss), OP's playstyle almost perfectly fits Tank Chronomancer in raids.
---
I tried to read this but failed.

Oh and sorry for not noticing the weekly question thread! I looked through the rules before i posted and saw nothing of the sorts so i didn't even think of actually being smart and looking at the front page, i'll keep that in mind for the future tho, thanks for hte heads up!
---
Then Teapot, or someone in their group, can post their proof here. However, when bosses drop this easily and quickly, there isn't much importance in first kills on normal.
---
not arguing, just stating since there is no order of bosses ;) you were first to kill both tho
---
what do they look like?
---
i haven't seen anyone post pics.
---
or just not kicked people out when it closes would have been useful.
---
Did more looking, found it. Someone had theirs dyed all orange/black and I saw purple traces coming off it as it moved.... yikes! That's a no-buy from me.
---
I don't have this issue at all.. went all shadow abyss and i can't seem to spot any purple?
---
Give scepter or focus and base it on shadow magic to give protection similar to assassins in gw1, with some healing.
---
Change f1 to shadow step to ally and heal both
---
Make one more elite spec for each class, with a weapon unique to that spec.  Then one year later, just dump every weapon on every class and open up the ones locked to elite specs.
---
That gif link isn't working for me, just fyi.
---
I can't think of any important uses for that as of now, but at least it'd be kinda fun to ping that in chat. I'm sure someone would figure out a good use for it eventually.
---
Some dyes mitigate it I use Darkess

Do the stats or percentages differ at all from a Heroes banner? Thnx

Oh they will, I have enough mount skins to know that Anet can please me. It's just that I'll have to endure the default single-dyed mount skin for more longer than I anticipated. It's alright though the same thing happened with the beetle, it took forever before we had more options lol.
---
Are you saying that you can back convert from LD to LI right now?
---
Make a post, see if it gets any traction. I just doubt it will really go anywhere since most new players don't use Reddit, and the ones who do are typically aware that story spoilers can be found here in casual discussion since they are familiar with the ways of the internet
---
I call them:
---
1. one earring aka aur or vis (whitish balls)
---
2. both earrings aka aur/vis, (pinkish/purple dividing balls)
---
3. ring aka coalescence  (bluish balls that connect to a bubble with a blackish form)
---
4. all trinkets aka aur/vis + coalescence (all of the above)
---
With no trinkets I have #2, with aurora I have #3.
---
I would personally *love* to see a warrior using a traditionally magic-only weapon, such as scepter or focus or even staff (I'm counting staff as 'magic-only' because I don't think ANet would just go the 'another melee staff' option here), mainly because I'd love to see what ANet could do with a class that has been, for the most part, always thematically a muggle. 
---
I'm not sure if this is exactly *needed*, but what about Guardian elite spec that deals with *enemy* boons? As it is, I don't believe guardians have any class-specific methods for removing boons from enemies. Something like a Dark Priest or something, tho they'd have to theme it right to make it not feel too much like a necro or revenant.
---
I think part of the issue going forward is going to be elite spec overlap: how do we introduce a new elite spec (such as the aforementioned Dark Priest) without it overlapping existing elite specs (such as a boon corrupt Scourge)?
---
that's a yikes from me dog. something that costs $30 USD minimum, $40 or more in other countries and they can't even get it right? dont hold out hope for a fix unless there is sufficient outrage.
---
This is such an amazing addition. WvW, Open world map completion groups, working on meta achievements for Vision and not wanting a boss to scale up. Really liking all of these QoL changes Anet.
---
Odd, changed to Imgur, lesser quality but should be visible now :)
---
I can only convert from LD to LI right now. I don't have the option which I had before to convert my LI to LD.
---
Thank you for your details response and time. I’ll give chronomancer another rub or might try firebrand like you and another recommended. I’ll definitely look into some discord’s for GW2 Raid training, maybe it’ll be easier from that front.
---
I completely agree with your quoted statement from another post. I guess I get what they[ANet] were going for, but I think they should have either gone all in on no trinity or make a new system. Having a “soft trinity” is sort of like foreplay with the sex (pardon my metaphor). They hint at being able to X but don’t fully give the reigns to do so. They allows DPS as a role, healer (if you’re a Druid from what I can see for the most part), but it kind of feels like they only allow chrono to “tank”. I would imagine it more fun/unique to balance classes to allow different professions tank or heal within their gameplay paradigm. I guess I just want a little more freedom from having the flexibility to alter my play style as suggested in the excerpt. Because right it feels like there is options, but we’re only allowed to chrono or Druid or FB/Renegade. It’s very surprising that warrior, the almost staple DPS or tank character in most games instead fills as a banner support or DPS with no option as a tank.
---
Sorry got a little ranty at the end there.
---
I had just taken to warning the map i wasn't an event tag. but this is better. Now rp events can be just for those invited.
---
Lets see about making a list:
---
Portobello Mushrooms into Platinum ore
---
Thank you for your answer kind stranger
---
You'll get Orichalcum ore.  The current top nodes are not upgraded.
---
I swear I would be no where in this game without tekkit.
---
In before this is intended as a response to people who hated the combined look before and coalescence will have a third new look.
---
What is this, where you get those ?
---
The Spirit Shard drain, we need and deserve.
---
I never knew this was something that I wanted
---
Full condi or full power does alright (and they use 4 kits). They arent competitive, but do pretty good for general pve. Celestial is a big waste though.
---
Rifle and condi holo builds use 2+ kits and concept is literally the same.
---
FINALLY.
---
Infusion is also abailable from the new raid
---
I think it’s still competitive but for most players that want to face roll there are easier engi builds.
---
that's REALLY hard to see
---
yeah it really looks like fairy dragon but also with wings up it looks similar to "ascended Aurene" or whatever you want to call it from final scene from last episode.
---
Just saw them in game compared and the new skin has a smaller body. The wings are about the same size side by side. I'm glad to see that (I madea post complaining about how large the wings were)
---
You could kick after combat and before they loot the chest, if they didn't have autoloot (or for special cases like Deimos, Xera if you're speedy)
---
The definition of the word Coalescence also makes it seem "fitting" to say.
---
Should probably just make it so you can't kick after boss is defeated.
---
Well if discounts happen often at set times it could be possible.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience

If you still fail to see the difference, allow me to outline it for you. It's the face. The body of the skyscale is fine (except for the tail, seriously what is it with anet and oversized, bulging tail tips?) but the face is just all wrong. It completely ruins the look.
---
Thank you for your answer.
---
The infusion can also be bought from Glenna in w7 once you've beaten the last boss. Could probably be looted as well.
---

That s fine as long as it runs reasonably steady for the most part I will be happy! Have been previously playing on a laptop so I'm hoping for a half decent improvement on that!
---
:l wish we could preview dyes on skins before we buy them!! Gah. It's always so confusing. Thanks.

Yeap. As others said, FPS will drop in crowded places, but you should be a-ok for 99% of the game
---
Never trust Skritt's definition of a shiny.

Ah my bad, I thought they were separate caps.

They said earlier than everything will be obtainable only from raids after 2 weeks. Open world stuff is just a bonus for people who dont raid.

Finally i use for spirit shards! cause everyone with 10k+ needed something.
---
Well it *is* a glyph of *alchemy*, guess we'll finally learn ANet's own laws of equivalent exchange. Any chance you could give Eir a good whack with it? ;P
---
out of wvw it is literally the worst mount. there used to be no worst mount, since each mount did something unique, but warclaw is a raptor that's slower, it's dash barely counts as a dash, it jumps lower and it's mount skill deals next to no damage, nor does it have cc. I feel like it would be better if they made it so warclaw outside of wvw is just a reskin of raptor
---
How'd you rate the difficulty?
---
This is a container you get when mining the special node after killing a World Boss. You can also purchase it on the TP, though with droprates like these, I wouldn't.
---
Thank you very much. No need to apologize for other people but i see their point. I am at fault here too. Have a good day :)
---
Perfect for excluding players and making things less accessible to solo players. I'll bet people will use this a lot and I'm not sure why.
---
I've used the invisible workaround for guild events, especially for our bounty nights. It's super frustrating when you have a solid group of 10 guildies and you can't kill a boss or it's 10x harder because pugs come and scale it and don't contribute damage or cc.
---
I especially used it in Hot for that damned vine tooth event, since his cc bar scales insanely. We literally 1 burned it in less than a minute. Meanwhile, if you had joined an lfg for it could take the entire duration or even fail because of the amount of players.
---
Do you mean leaderless squad or something else?
---
Many dragons in GW2 have had smooshed faces. Look at Aurene, Vlast, Glint, Ranger pet Wyverns, Kralk, Mordremoth, etc.
---
It's definitely in line with the dragon aesthetic that exists within this title. I'm also sure any of these dragon variants would come into existence as a common skin, not necessarily a 2000 gem one.
---
I would say my biggest additions would be..  
---
* Dismount enemies with Engage skill. When two people meet and both are mounted, you just wave and keep going. Even if you wanted to engage them, it's almost always moot to even try since they can get away before you can deplete the health of the mount.   
---
* Increase Damage with Chain Pull.  2k per pull isn't bad, but at the cost of valuable supply, it is normally not worth it when you can invest the supply into another ram to deal much more damage.   
---
* Mount Skin earned through WvW. Let it be prestigious, make it a high rank skin like the sublime, have it match the Legendary Backpiece in aesthetics.   
---
* Decrease it's health pool in WvW. Right now, it's pretty easy to get away from a fights that you don't want to engage in, even if you happened to get hit a few times while running off. This goes vice versa as well, and its frustrating. There is no reason it should have as much health as it does when the purpose of the mount was for siege and a replacement for permaswift.
---
I think there has always been the option to exchange LD per LI without limit. The bug is that we have lost the other option, LI per LD (until 168).
---
It only shows if your shaders are on high. If your shaders are on medium or lower the dyes look dramatically different.
---
confusing
---
&gt; It's super frustrating when you have a solid group of 10 guildies and you can't kill a boss or it's 10x harder because pugs come and scale it and don't contribute damage or cc.
---
That's a good point for it existing in PvE, agreed.
---
Raid skins are always underwhelming.
---
Not the only option but the alternative is worse
---
Definitely not always. When the armored raptor (Dreadnought) came out together with Jahai, I got a key from map completion and got the skin from that. That was in launch week, perhaps even on launch day.
---
Wicked, thanks for sharing. Time to put all them spirit shards to good use! You watch... they'll release a cool new item only obtainable with heaps of spirit shards once we've spent them all on these... my spidey senses are tingling!
---
It's about efficiency. Chrono tanks are some of the safest tanks but they are by far not the only tank. Other classes that "tank" the bosses would be heal renegade, firebrand as the coincidental tank due to Imbued Quickness trait, heal scourges, druids. 
---
In each case, these "tanks" are providing something else whether it be healing or boons. Warriors in theory could tank but ultimately issue almost always come back to what else can do the job without compromising damage or doing an additional role. Warrior as BS + a chrono doing boons tanking will do more than a warrior BS tanking and a chrono doing boons in the highest dps gear that one could find. This is in part due to scaling on chrono and the fact that BS warrior's buffs are not linked to a stat like chrono is which concentration is required.
---
I have everything on the highest settings except for character model limit and character quality. These are on the lowest, mostly because my cpu can't handle ~~all the shinies~~
---
I like the torch; goes well with my bolt
---
Because tag watching is a common tactic used by enemy servers with alt accounts.
---
There are a few guilds on my server that run small, 5-10 man groups that are more coordinated and often provide support to the larger open squad. I don't think this is inherently a bad thing. I think it just means fewer randoms are going to follow a group like that, even if the squad is full for the main tag.
---
wtf
---
I rechecked, it's 25. I was checking it too fast or believed the patch notes too much.
---
I can't imagine spending nearly as much on one mount skin as an expansion...
---
Another thing that has been asked forever finally added what a day.
---
Warrior banners are floating midair above the ground, Elementalist AoEs can't be placed correctly and shift automatically sometimes, I assume this is also the case with all other classes.
---
It would be great to have a low res version of the lands around instead of an endless ocean, but hey I'm just glad I can fly now.
---
Can you post a screen of the vendor?
---
&gt; Open world map completion groups, working on meta achievements for Vision and not wanting a boss to scale up.
---
...so basically, excluding other solo players who could join on the fun for whatever reason - now also outside of raids and WvW.
---
Even w4 took hours to first clear and it's considered one of the easiest wings now.
---
Besides, an average gw2 player isnt even capable of clearing event encounters.
---
Try to pass a cat tag or commander tag to someone who didn't have that specific tag unlocked but did have the other one unlocked. So you'd get someone in squad who had a regular commander tag but no cat tag then try to pass him a cat tag. Bing-bang-boom, invisible squad. Super easy, most people found it by accident.
---
DB has Phi and GOTL who do at least 3 organized runs a week (I think gotl does 5?). PDF also runs sometimes. Haven't seen Eins or gods for awhile, they may have left when BGA and GAL did shortly after last "relink".
---
IoJ is truly dead, I think CUBE may be their only guild with numbers.
---
At least when I run, that's what I observe.
---
you're assuming the context in which people will use them in pve
---
Bring us red(and other) guardian colors
---
I only mined 3 and then the node didn't appear at the 4th boss I went to.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/445442355072466944/588063067422851102/gw020.jpg final
---
That's great!
---
And I am glad about it.
---
same. logged off for the day. tired of dealing with inconsistent buggy content.
---
Not sure if you meant the mount should have 1k removed from its actual hp bar or if it should have 1k max hp. Knowing you can hit wayyy above 1k dmg with a vast array of skills, i do think 1k max hp is a bit low. However yeah, they should definitely have their hp reduced to make dismounting easier!
---
while other people in same the instance could mine the node, it was very odd
---
didn't seem to be any correlation between how many bosses you had done and it working or not
---
Abyssal Forest says no
---
ppl dont know fennec anymore FeelsWeirdMan
---
There's a raid kill thread for a reason.
---
And pretty skins like the Shrine Guardian are the best selling in the game. So based on those trends, they made another pretty skin that drastically changes the look. Your subjective opinion of what you'd have preferred to see doesn't stack up against the cold hard facts that "pretty = sales"
---
I really would like more details. For example a better list of what's upgraded.  Also the cap for each.
---
It's already being done in game through a work around.. Now it's just with the Tag instead of the Alt codes (arrows, heart, etc).
---
Players do not have a right to be in my squad, thus invite only, and if i'm trying to run a smaller group to say get an achievement, and half the map shows up and scales the boss up that creates a problem. Now no one can get the achievement and the curious random players are ruining it for the organized groups. This goes both ways. You can make a point to it, and i can make the counter. Since it's already being done, this just allows a Tag symbol. Literally nothing is changing for ANYONE except the people who are already in said squad.
---
What you call "stat reset" is a feature of legendary armor, it's literally the main reason people expend a lot of time and effort in getting legedendary. There isn't such a thing as "stat reset" in ascended armor, only the recrafting I've indicated above.
---
How many Divinations?
---
Yeah, I just did SB and, while I could hear other people mining it, it was nowhere to be found on my screen.
---
I doubt it will be used very often in pve, but I can see it being useful in a handful of situations, for example I was helping my bf who is a new player and had my tag up because he was having trouble finding me on the map and then i had several other people following waiting for something exciting to happen, I mean I'm happy to help new players but just wanted to focus on my bf for a little bit
---
IIRC the prompt is literally "Respect [F]"
---
I'll take two.
---
Home instance nodes always had weird interactions with more complicated glyphs.
---
CM world first is real world first : O
---
its also completely optional
---
What is the name of the infusion?
---
I'm glad you know what my settings are. /s
---
The real reason I can't see it is because it doesn't have a purple aura like you're claiming.
---
Tehree has never been progression in this game rofl just go fuckin play WoW if thats what u really want
---
There was a reward for griffon, but not in game though.
---
He's having a stroke. Call an ambulance!
---
Ya but the comment hes responding to is saying they can kick before the boss dies.
---
Progression on the first 3 wings took days. Yes, we have a more established meta for raiding, but it's a complete joke for WF to be over before most of NA is even home from work.      
---
In other words, STFU.   Also, you replied to Fennec of all god-damn people.
---
50-70 depending on map and 27-35 in metas
---
Here is another one: https://gfycat.com/complicatedidolizedatlasmoth
---
They specifically said before that there was not going to be another Dhuum or W5 level difficulty in terms of raid....but more like W1 and now W6.
---
that is where the "no" to anybody can join, comes in. this means only commander can invite.
---
but not a particular good one tho
---
Peerless
---
Might have been old information.
---
They fixed mesmer clones and broke everyone else in return, nothing to see here (except for the animation ofc)
---
I only have Aurora but the effect of Aurora+Vision.
---
do you have gif of the infusion?
---
Time is money. Not sure why a single green charm matters. Even if it went up to 5g.. That's only 5g I can get in the future. Lol
---
I had this, I got a new effect each time I went to a new map.
---
Yeah, I did a little mat conversion and while there's profit in it, the time consumption makes it more of a 'once in a while' type thing. The banners are another nice outlet for excess shards.
---
If I'm understanding correctly, the Spirit Banner stacks with the Heroes Banner, which I already use. Could be a decent idea to use both before meta events or bosses.
---
It looked interesting until "upgraded limited times per day"
---
Just to clarify for people who don't understand: you can choose which boss you want to do first (left or right). dP chose to go left while Teapot went right
---
I thought I had that set, apparently I didn't back then. Next event I made sure it was set, but we still had people swarming us.
---
CMs for all three
---
Certain dyes like the arcane dye and harrowing maroon can make the wings change colors when its flapping.
---
Not hard. The mechanics are very straightforward. We were way overthinking it.
---
For me and multiple others, the special node didn't appear at the Shadow Behemoth.
---
There are other good suggestions in here, but I play Condi Firebrand and don't get any meaningful damage out of weapon-1.  The rotation relies mostly on scepter-2, axe-2, and F1 tome to stack burning. 90-95% of my damage is from burning, some bleeds, and very little from autos.
---
Wow it’s amazing that you mastered it in only one day! It took me several weeks to finally get it right. You are a pro!
---
/u/Slick_Hunter I just got one more, looks like it was the Behemoth.
---
Probably just another in the series of animation bugs of the 3 legendary trinkets.
---
Except when you switch your shader setting to medium, this will get rid of the purple aura
---
It's you! I mean we have a freaking WINCHESTER.
---
Crazy. It must be all sorts of bugged rn lol
---
what was the catmander tag bug?
---
same and if i strip my character naked it still shows aurora + vision
---
How is this infusion obtained?
---
I checked, you can see it on high shader settings, you won't see it on medium settings.
---
Thank God.
---
How many bosses are there?
---
Has to be level 68+ exotics and you can use master/mystic kits but the rate is lower. The black lion kits being ~1 per is just the average and you could get several that give 0 then one that gives 3 right after, it's all a chance.
---
I forgot they had reduced adrenaline my bad
---
Oh nice. Wonder how long cms will take.
---
If you could make a video/gif of it I would love you forever
---
i'll cry at the price of mystic coin if tahts the case :p
---
&gt; Do you not know how to hide a tag?
---
~~Do you guys not have phones?~~
---
Yes, I do not know how to hide a tag without leaving and rejoining, just like the other 90% of the gamers who do not sit on reddits, forums and discords.
---
And some info on cost woulda been nice too
---
More purple..yay. Not,
---
Also whats the title for full wing clear with cms
---
It's 2k raid currency + 20g.
---
U got to clear W7 then it is purchasable
---
For Cardinal Sabir, how do you deal with his CC bar that regens super quickly? We can only do damage to it with the special action so I guess you just have to make everybody has those and then use it all at once?
---
Which one would that be?
---
Show them this. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yyRWZD2-0&amp;list=PLubHEA1nB3QAb59\_ahCilRdNzAEzuIqJE&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yyRWZD2-0&amp;list=PLubHEA1nB3QAb59_ahCilRdNzAEzuIqJE&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s)

Call me stubborn, but Id still give the mount the luxury of tanking at least a hit. 1200 dmg can be done with a good autoattack. While yes I understand that some classes are melee only, I dont think that mount, if it were less tanky, would the main problem there. Even before the mounts,  being an exclusive melee class would be a pain if you didnt pick some movement skills to help you get in melee range. In zergs its less of a problem I guess. 
---
Thats only my point of view though, might be super wrong! As for the mount hp, Id give it maybe more or less half of what its actually got, so around 4 to 5k hp. Is it too much?
---
I usually run a mix. Harrier's is great, but full harrier's is overkill (or overheal more like it).
---
Ah I forgot about that, cool!
---
Can you post a video / pic of the raid vendor?
---
The limit is on the result, not your materials. If as long as you have the materials, you'd be able to craft up to 2000 of the result.
---
I do not know you would want to make 2000 Bloodstone Ingots in one sitting, tho.
---
My shader settings are already on high. This isn't an issue of shaders -- the OP is being dishonest about the skin.
---
There has coalescense III collection now
---
if you where somewhat near the chest autoloot should have taken care of it tho
---
CM1 done  [https://imgur.com/a/RZ4hrLo](https://imgur.com/a/RZ4hrLo)
---
Rifle DE will let you hit very high DPS numbers but it's only single target. Depends on the content you play most really. Personally I enjoy Rifle/DagDag for open world stuff and I'll swap to Daredevil staff for fractals/dungeons for the multi target cleave
---
i actually tried that but even when my char is naked i get the aurora effect. i even relogged. i cant get rid of it.
---
He isn't tho. I've clearly seen a difference with shaders on high vs lower settings. High settings have a clear iridescent tint which significantly change the dye look.
---
Seems like this should have been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bzfhyw/is_it_just_me_or_are_the_new_weapon_skins/) so people would have an easier time figuring out what weapons you're taking about.
---
We don't know since apparently no one has done it yet or hasn't shown it off.
---
Dye slot for infusions!
---
Yea, sometimes I think that I do ultimately work for Ebenezer Scrooge, when every major player in every industry try to "save money". Every early meeting nowadays ends with ultimate we need to save more. Results so far I witnessed was two massive quits by whole departments, last time I joined and pissed GM so much... he naively thought that I can and would cover for 10+ employees.
---
Griffon is 250 gold, skyscale is 250 of each ls4 map currency.
---
Some Heroes banners have the light pillar, and some don't. Maybe something went wrong with the transition? On which are you getting the popups?
---
Finally can stop kicking myself for grabbing a catmander tag
---
You can still see it slightly on medium.
---
Staff Engineer. Technomancer or Golemancer. Controls or pilots a mech. If it controls it would be a minionmancer type class where you directly control skills 1-5 of the minion as your hot bar.
---
On any non-Heroes banner (didn't test on heroes)
---
This purple effect will change depending on the dye used. It's an iridescence effect. It's purple/orange for red hue, blue grey for grey hue, reddish for green dyes, pink for yellows, reddish purple for orange, bluish purple for browns, green for blues, and blue for purples
---
I found that cringey.
---
As someone with a distaste for purple, anet making the med and high shader iridescence undyeable really turned me off from this.
---
Thank you. I've added them to the wiki.
---
They said I could be anything, so I became Super Monkey Ball!
---
It looks Literally just like a dragon because it is one. Face shape has no bearing on that. It's a dragon with a shorter face that, surprise, looks like a dragon.
---
You tagged as either normal com or cat, then passed it to someone who only had the other one if I understood it correctly.
---
I'm still waiting for some use for foxfire. Just waiting ...
---
no, the effect is totally different. You can preview the  new Qadim minion which has the same effect.
---
smh
---
&gt; and the only way to find out whether a tag was public or not was to show up and see if the commander told you to sod off or not.
---
right click--&gt; join? when nothing happens, its private. you can do that from everywhere on the map.
---
Zerg players seem to enjoy wardlaw while roaders tend to be the ones who hate it, so my suggestion would benefit readers the most: dynamic hp scaling. There is already scaling on tower and keep lords when x number of players are within x distance, so I think warclaw's hp could react the same. When near a zerg the current hp would be fine, but out in the field when just one player is trying to engage the hp could be halved like others suggested. I think the warclaw is a good addition for zerg players, or even less mobile roamers so I dont want to see it completely useless. But it should also reward smart play rather than being a free invuln.
---
Also better skins pls it's so ugly
---
Yup. I fell behind and only have 260 LI--not enough for even W1 anymore. Chances that I get to do W7 are basically zero.
---
Everlasting Ally of Ahdashim is the new title and also there is new chair.
---
The shimmer is permanent purple.
---
There's always a spike of popularity at launch but over time with the release of additional skins (mount licenses, other 2k skins, etc.) it usually slow down.
---
Step 1: Release an expensive but niche skin first.
---
Step 2: Gather money from the skin-starving community, even from those who didn't really want a niche skin.
---
Step 3: Release more usual skins somewhat later.
---
Step 4: Gather money the second time.
---
I loved dd and still do using its highly evasive and high burst melee spec. But i also love de for sniping ppl from far away, while also doing ok melee using sword dagger. 
---
Dd is very evasive melee spec, while de with rifle is more reliant on stealth and ranged burst.
---
i got the pop-up on the heroes banner and the new spirit banner as well. its behaving like it always has, if you didnt have the buff, you get the pop-up, if you already have the buff, no pop-up
---
For super shiny weapons it is 1 charged core and 3 of each essence for super shiny weapons the same as the ones used to make the shiny (at least for staff)
---
At least people who smack them all on one toon without any coordination don't have 10 different colors this way!
---
Do people still have the option to join the squad if they click on your character model?
---
If you mean gift of mastery check r/gw2exchange, you’ll find people there who only deal in GoM
---
I guess it could be complicated for em to implement such mechanic? However I like the idea! And yeah base warclaw is scary x)
---
Same. Ive got the effecct of Vision &amp; Aurora, even without any equipment on my char. With my Aurora I get to part three.
---
Indeed it is. My information was incorrect, apologies :(
---

---
Average FFXIV players can clear the standard difficulty of their raids with relative ease on day zero. The regular encounters being relatively easy isn't much of a problem imho.
---
Now if CM gets cleared like it was nothing? *That's* a problem.
---
Exactly, there isn't any situation in which a Jackal's phasing wouldn't give you more survivability. Warclaw was never intended to be used outside of WvW except to look pretty I'd wager.
---
Solo players don't have a right to join every group doing what they want to do. The world doesn't revolve around them.
---
FINAAAALLLYYYYY!!!
---
Lol
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The new skin has a normal dragon head and not the squished up one anet does??   
---
Grow a brain idiot
---
GoM?
---
Anyone already got the infusion and can post how it looks?
---
Yeah i wish they would make some harder raid wings for the future.. not everything has to be cleared the first hour of the release :(
---
My issue is when it splits into like 10+ different collections at once suddenly which is just overwhelming. My instinctive response to that was a big nope.avi and I took a break for a few days. Hell, the UI can't even track all that on screen. Please consolidate this stuff more, Anet.
---
Blizzard is already lawsuit trigger-happy
---
Maybe a forged skin?
---
Gates of Madness, the world. Sorry for not being clear.
---
I would pre-order is they would do this!
---
Gates of Madness, the server.
---
I do the same thing, I actually use the warclaw to get out of the keep and move out a bit, and then I just walk.
---
You don't always want a tag in WvW. If your running stealth, additional pugs outside of squad will mess you up 100%. If you're smaller and just want to run a small havoc or run support to a larger tag, you don't want a tag. Finally, it's just not guilds responsibility to provide a expierence to those who aren't as serious about wvw. A lot of people spend a lot of time and energy on builds, comp, and just showing up, and it's perfectly fine that they want to just play with people of a similar mindset.
---
was i arguing that GW2 dragons looked like that? was i arguing that it didnt fit within the gw2 aesthetic? no. you said, and i quote:
---
&gt;I didn't realize the standard Skyscale model didn't already achieve that look, TIL I guess!
---
"normal" dragons in this context being the ones i linked, you proceed to reply while completely ignoring what i said.
---
For wvw? It would die. Horribly. To most things.
---
There's no build link to scrutinise but assuming it's vanilla 3 kit cele, its damage, sustain, and mobility would be too low. Particularly the latter two; you won't have secondary heals/sustain like a scrapper or holo (think sneak gyro, barrier, heat therapy), you'd have 1 stunbreak if you took elixir gun, and acid bomb would be your only movement skill.
---
My guardian now needs this.
---
Haha omg, that's great. I wish there would be a toothless-like skin for the skyscale xD are you playing on EU by any chance?
---
Worst idea ever gg Anet
---
he seems to have a habit of replying to himself and not the person he is trying to argue with. lol
---
Ah I see, You mean something like anniversary sales and so on.
---
Charged cores used to be like 60s when John smith was in charge.  They were recently 4s...  I think they could go up a bit.
---
again, someone who can't read. "NORMAL dragon" as in, the type of dragon most common and popular within the western fantasy genre. it's a dragon with a shorter face that, surprise, does not look like a *normal* dragon.
---
The second one looks like a forged shatterer.
---
But that's the thing, that is a "normal" dragon as far as GW2 is concerned. You're wanting a different looking head, and I get that, but that doesn't discount that this *IS* the "normal" dragon aesthetic for this title.
---
And once again, I'm sure they will be making plenty of dragon skins that are more to your liking, given the base model is a dragon. I'd rather the 2000 gem skins, which often seem to go for drastically changing the model even going as far as changing the species, *not* simply being "dragon, but this way now"
---
just do what i did and fake your way in, seriusly the 500+ LI condition to even join a pug are silly af, if you know the encounter, know your class and dont fk up it should be enough.
---
I have never gone to raid exept a a few w1 first boss failed runs when it came out, but when i saw Oblivion and that the only way to get it was trough W5, i first took a few hours to watch a video guide of every encounter in the wing from every role posible on each fight, learned them by heart, searched wich build was the most adecuate for my class, and then used a random item generator i found to fake my KP and get into one.
---
Today now i have Oblivion, Coalesence precursor, gift of complex emotions, and i have less than 20 LI and only 11 LD. and tbh i felt that i was peforming better than some of these ppl with apparently over 100+ LIs
---
Stupid question but is there Shiny or reference to him in new raid?
---
People need to understand it all depends on the group doing the content I'm guessing this guild is a no life raiding guild. They would know the perfect meta to use, the best classes, the best roles, the beta foods to take etc. I suck at raids so this would take me longer. Its like PvP I suck at PvP as well if I go in there I'd be destroyed but if I stuck at it I'd learn and get better. Just because a group who focus on raids mainly beat this raid quickly doesn't mean the bosses are piss easy it just means they know this side of the game.
---
its not. stop spreading lies. its just broken. this is **NOT** what coalescence is supposed to look like
---
ohhh thx - i still prefer basic aurora (one trinket) effect though :)
---
&gt; Funerary Incense
---
Makes little sence, these are PoF related and this whole ring has been raid related. It might be an item you need to buy with Magnetite shards/Gaeting Crystals.
---
Depends on how often you update your LFG, but yeah, their spam detection is way too sensitive.q
---
Ouch it’s really worse than I thought, your mount is really all pink.
---
I wonder if it’s something Anet can fix since I assume unaware buyers might ask for a refund...
---
I think it's just in case you sold the original, but man it feels lame that W1234 has repeatable legendaries and W567 has literally just a one and done :(
---
imagine the price of pristine brandsparks will shoot up...oh god the price of crystal lodestones and the cores! 86c will turn ti silver?!?!?!?
---
Seems nice for small groups of people since trying to find party member map dots is  i m p o s s i b l e.
---
Re-read more carefully and it seems to be something that only applies to mithril, elder wood and specific cooking ingredients. So it just limits how much orichalcum, ancient wood and certain cooking ingredients you can get out of it while other ingredients are not limited.
---
This seems useless to me. If I want the higher tier item I could just go gather from the higher tier node ... maybe it is more useful if you only have one character.
---
Open your PvP build window (in the PvP lobby). Go to your specializations. You can select either deadeye or Daredevil in the 3rd specialization bar
---
Yeah so since you have both expansions, you can use staff for Daredevil or rifle for deadeye 
---
Only in PvP though. You can't use them in PvE if you don't have them unlocked.
---
People still say dope?
---
So I should use staff for pvp? What about the build and utilities?
---
Yeah I just don't have anything to get begin guessing at anything else. 
---
On the other hand that is each to check. Just need to grab 1 incense and 1 divination to see if they go in together.
---
The commander paid for the game and their tag. They should be able to choose how they want to use it.
---
WvW players have been asking for this for so long!
---
Oh I don't play PvP anymore, so I'm not updated on current builds. I was just clarifying what the other person said.
---
Maybe it wants 100 or 250 Gift of Complex Emotions.
---
On the other hand players' reaction to that will probably involve simple emotions ...
---
head to metabattle and learn the rotations. but yeah, pvp unlocks it all, once you get to pve, even if you own the expacs you have to earn those skills.
---
Of course, you dope

---
&gt;The difficulty for these encounters is meant to be in the "savage" versions of the fight. In GW2, this is would be the CM versions of the fight. That's there the meaningful world first clear is. That's when prog goes into double-digit hours (sometimes days, depending on how they're releasing new gear in that update cycle). That's where the prestige is.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The GW2 community seems to liken clears of the base difficulty to the prestige difficulty of raids in other games (which I'd wager is due to early raids not having CMs). It seems a bit disingenuous to do that in my book now that the content is getting consistent CMs though.  
---
&gt;If normal mode falls to high-end teams pretty fast, w/e. It's normal mode. It's supposed to be at least somewhat accessible to the endgame player. If CM gets steamrolled in two hours? That's a problem, and the difficulty of those encounters should be looked at when designing future releases.
---
I think that is a great philosophy to have if there was any structure around repeating the CMs. The fact is that the 'world first CMs' is effectively the only time these groups do CMs, so the normal mode difficult/enjoyment matter on a weekly/long term basis.
---
I enjoyed it from a lore/story perspective because that's how I play.  Think about it - you aren't going to hatch a baby skyskale and be able to immediately ride it.  A 24 hour period is 12 ingame days. The 5 day time-gate, meant that ingame we were raising the skyskale after hatching for 60 days, or around 2 months. Then it continues to grow over more time depending on how many days it takes a person to complete various events and jumping puzzles.  
---
Not everything has to be a rush.  It's a journey. Several of my guild members, including myself, chose to limit the stealth training &amp; agility training to once per day so that it made sense and so we could .  I really loved feeding and playing with my skyskale, and once I finish everything with the saddle (a little short on currencies currently), I hope I'm still able to play those mini-games occasionally. 
---
If  you didn't enjoy the collection, and wanted it to "be over so \[you\] could quit the game again," Why did you work on it?
---
Taimi, I don't feel so good
---
Could be worse ... could be like mail.
---
Failing to send anything because you forgot to specific the recipient still counts against your limit of 2. The LFG equivalent would probably be clicking edit then clicking cancel counting against you.

How's the mic quality?

This is a really, reeeeeeally old video. His build is also severely nerfed and the gameplay is not like that anymore, but it really shows how fluid and dynamic the combat can be. I always liked this video and it inspired me to try thief and this build at the time and since then it became my main.
---
That's quality spoiler!
---
I liked the scavenger hunts, but the clues definitely needed some work.
---
&gt;The same group took much much longer on all the other wings, especially dhuum
---
You've got to look at the reason why though. Dhuum had a brand new mechanic for 3 members within the first 2 minutes of the fight, and it was buggy and unclear as to what you were supposed to do. Once people ironed out the green mechanic consistently it really didn't take that long.

There's a [Weekly Question Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/by7t1w/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_june_08_2019/) for small stuff like this. Nobody needs this on the front page, that's why some people just downvote I guess.
---
This is all I want in general
---
There seems to be some sort of hitbox issue with the worldbosses.  Just did Teq and dropped an aoe on it's foot like usual and it spawned up in the air next to it's head.
---
This is why raid training discords are a thing. As long as you've got a build and a can pull decent numbers no one really cares how much you've killed other bosses.

If they do that and don't do backpacks I'll be mad (not really, I'll just be sad)

As a roamer, I love the Warclaw. It let's me actually roam outnumbered versus sweaty gank squads that like chasing across entire maps.

And that's a shame, honestly. Farming savage is big thing in FFXIV's endgame, especially for prestige items. Of course, in FFXIV, the eventual fate of all content regardless of its difficulty at launch is it getting trivialized 6 or so months later. By the time the newest expansion drops, undersized parties stomp the old content  multiple times an hour. (Exception being Ultimate/Super Savage content, which forces you to an ilevel cap to never trivialize it).
---
If I have any critique of GW2's raids as they stand now (aside from if CM winds up being too easy, which is still in the air at time of posting), it's that CM isn't personally worth doing more times than for the clear that gives you the achievement/title.
---
Hopefully after LS5 starts, things will be less purple. Kralk IS dead after all. 
---
But then we have Aurene. Blue will be the new purple.
---
Great change!  Now I can utilize all the map markers without unnecessarily drawing attention.
---
@ebnq they just announced on live stream that they will hot fix it to regular quartz from charged
---
They just announced on livestream that the charged quartz in recipe will be changed to regular quartz
---
It has more abilities than pretty much every other spec, therefore it spends less time pressing 1.  Not only that but you really only auto a few times during the fresh air rotation while waiting for attunement cooldowns.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Oh god the mail. What a joke.
---
Oh I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
Not to be ignorant, but what else would you classify expansion worthy content as?
---
Normal depends on where you're from. You're talking about normal from a western point of view, whereas someone from the "east" might disagree with you, their most popular idea of dragons are, of course, eastern style. If you mean most popular in Eurocentric games, stories, and media, sure, but dragons as a whole encompass tons of different forms. Hell, even the skyscale looks just like a normal Western dragon, you're just upset the face is not long enough lol
---
[&amp;AgFHZAEA][&amp;AgEoZAEA][&amp;AgERZAEA]
---
It's a purple fae dragon. Look at the different faerie dragons in WoW if you don't know what I mean. The only difference is that Anet made this one shimmering purple instead of rainbow colored.
---
Thank you for posting this explanation.  :)
---
Which is actually a good way to re-enact the meme: CoD was bad because you were forced to do that for a character you'd known for 10 minutes tops, and the game framed it like it was some super emotional moment.
---
OTOH, GW2 made you do that for a character who's been there since the beginning of the game, who your character crossed paths with several times, very trying times too, and makes it optional. I did it because the game *encouraged* me, but I didn't feel *forced*. Good shit.
---
Only disadvantage is that someone on a WC could come up and get you. Or the fact that someone on a WC has an advantage when beginning a fight or running away
---
Good gawd, that's awesome! :D
---
How do they place that there and think, "Yes, this is where this should go." ????
---
Definitely hella bannable.
---
that sounds like gold selling to me
---
I'm really enjoying the skyscale and I hope we get more of this. 
---
Its optional and content isn't blocked by this like the original 4 mounts were. Those were easy and quick to get as they should have been.
---
It involves multiple things (killing specific types of monsters, crafting, collecting map currency, scavenger hunts, JPs).
---
It reuses old zone and old content.
---
Most importantly, its a long term goal. Its not knocked out in an evening then we bitch about nothing to do for the next several months until the next episode.
---
Blah ... was worth the shot ... guess I needed someone to say it out loud. :D
---
well out answers will come when we know how many LD are needed for the ring. If it's something like 250 then you know there's only one and that the next one will be released on future wings. But if it's something like just 25 that means there would be ways to make extra copies of the ring, because what would be LDs supposed to be used on then?
---

Can you post pictures from a different map/lighting? This area already has a lot of purple light (check out the buildings in the background). I wonder how much the setting/ambient light sources impact the color.

Just got the skin. Goes well with most of my toons. Some folks are saying there’s a purple color that doesnt go away but it DOES go away depending on the dyes you use
---
They never said they wouldn’t release more wings in season 5.
---
Legion Backpack Glider 
---
When you dye it, the new colours only get used while gliding, not when equipped as backpack. Is that intended? 
---
If so, why can you dye the upper slot? to see a different colours while airbore feels senseless.
---
Cap it around 100 nodes or 300 conversions. Mith and elderwood share the cap in this bugged state.
---
[IvT] Just cleared it. (Link)[https://imgur.com/a/jG2y27n]
---
Maybe that's the reason , we'll never know .
---
Man why does all the new stuff have to be pink/purple.
---
I have the goop effect with Aurora only.
---
Oh, you mean the items themselves?
---
That's a server limitation.  Bigger capacity means bigger variables. Bigger variables means having to reserve more storage for those items.
---
Of course, once they go over 250 they can go up to 65K if the new variable uses 2 bytes, but there's ways to use partial bytes to save space.  
---
Things like nibbles are not used that often, but they are used. 
---
Not being able to accumulate to many of an item also keeps people from doing some things too fast.
---
Most of the big training discords dont play when I do. Not many people do.
---
I'm forced to use LFG and rarely I'd there anything at all. And when I do see one pop up, it's 300LI for Wing 1. Which I've done dozens of times and I could probably teach a group at this point.
---
There's just *nothing* between training groups and hardcore speedrun 1500+ LI 49kAP must have 19 sets of Legendary Armor groups.
---
Thanks. Pretty underwhelming to say the least. Think I'll skip grinding for these.
---
I'm okay they come and get me, I want to fight, I enjoy it... The issue is when they come up, and there's nothing in my entire kit I can do to knock them off. I feel that shouldn't be a case.
---
I only have Aurora and it changed for me too. I can't believe it but it looks even worse in action than it did just in the pictures.
---
Dropping shades/Wells is blocked by world boss hit boxes.
---
New aura ended up being purple, they threw purple into Qadim’s color scheme randomly with no explanation, skyscale has an unchangeable purple  aura. Like, is anyone going to fault me for being a little upset that whoever is designing this stuff is just using their OWN favorite color for everything?
---
I've never gotten anywhere near any of the challenges.  I took a stab at Atziri once, but I haven't really gone hardcore into PoE yet.  I've played a few leagues, gotten through the story and had a blast w/ the league mechanics! =D

If you DC during the fight, would you zone back in to the bouncy chest? Even if it died while you were still DC'd?

No, you're dreaming.

If i remember correctly, there's the daily bouncing chest and the boss chest. The daily is what gives the most tokens and it's once per day per path.

&gt; We're going to be updating the Mystic Forge recipe for Shiny Weapons for this event. Currently the Mystic Forge recipe for shiny weapons require Charged Quartz Crystals, but a future hotfix will be changing this to standard Quartz Crystals
---
ah so it's 80 for first run every path then it goes to twenty.I thought 80 was standard.
---
That explains why they were saying it was the same gains,because they are.
---
There isn't.
---
So like ghostly infusions. Can it also drop like ghostlies?
---
while a several millenia-old Elder Dragon was trying to fuck your mind
---
You don't deserve the shiny

Niiiice! Perfect for when you want to join a big world event, but not lead it, and play with a bunch of friends at the same time! Invisible squads ftw!
---
Once again, I hope that outfit will have lore relevance... :)
---
As always, check the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon).
---
I think so. This change also made loot not require you to be alive, because it's in the bouncy chest which you get anyway.
---
Find a guild with some members who play when you do. That way you could make your own groups
---
Well that outfit name isn't ominous at all, no sire
---
I'd like to see an option to queue for the map that the rest of your squad is in.  At least then you can wander around in your own map copy and accomplish something, which beats the current carpal-tunnel inducing *"Right click &gt; Join in ..."* method.

There has to be some benefit for those stuck in chrono jail

It can drop from the new event bags after you mine a world boss node. Otherwise it can be bought from Glenna. Unsure if it drops from W7 bosses though.

4th conversion component is Crystal Slivers

Thanks! Don't take a look.

Oh thank you! Interestingly enough it was the only Sliver item I was missing from my mat storage and I didn't even think to buy it to test it.

It's good that they announced this publicly before it happened. Charges Quartz is such a problem with its time-gate and what its usage does to the cost of Quartz in general, and I'm glad they're making this change.

It would be awesome if it was [Lord Odran](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lord_Odran). If someone knows anything about how the Mists exactly work, it's him. He's dead if we take the Guild Wars Manuscripts as something objective and not an unreliable narrator, but even then he had immense knowledge of temporal distorsions, so maybe he died years after his hypothetical appareance in current Tyria.
---
Core game is pretty easy and free so it's usually better when you play without specific guides unless something is very unclear. In most situations you can find solutions on gw2 wiki, followed by gw2crafts, gw2efficiency and metabattle websites.
---
Operator Umbra?
---
Are these tradable like the teleport mirrors?
---
Yeah that's a new bug with the latest update
---
The bug for me has so far displayed all 3 different effects on seperate maps.
---
There really isn’t a more efficient way to handle this. 
---
Players need to identify themselves adequately. That’s always going to be a manual process really, as it’s a judgement call.
---
Yep like teleport mirror
---
Not quite what happened. IIRC they were able to have Gaile’s account email changed, and then just did a forgot password recovery.
---
What was the reason for shortening the time?
---
That image has always been particularly striking to me. It's super appropriate for a physical art piece! Is it just something you printed?
---
Dunno. Might be good to park on a new character to mine copper nodes for iron. Extra orichalcum/ancient wood isn't a huge boon, though.
---
And the eye pieces are suspended in midair
---
Not disagreeing but your comment comes off as pretty rude my dude...
---
That's really pretty! I always loved that particular map screen.
---
Well I heard it's bugged so maybe hard to tell yet?
---
But good point about ancient wood and ori not worth much.
---
Good. I’m sick and tired of the GW2 subreddit getting clogged with the same question being asked 5 times a day because they’re too lazy to search, especially when we have a dedicated questions thread.
---
Yea that's why I would prefer a condi build, I want to use all the skills of the elite spec. Power quickbrand does not make sense to me but it's what is used the most.
---
That's my dilemma: follow the meta or not ?
---
&gt;Whatever you do, do not ask me to post what full Permafrost looks like. You will be permanently blinded in-game &amp; irl, may the five have mercy on us all.
---
Tempted to buy the skyscale skin now...
---
Because fifty bucks right now is better than a hundred bucks tomorrow, right?
---
Well it depends. Do you like playing condi over power? Because I can tell you definitively that Power Quickbrand is better for most fractals. It's just a trade-off of personal enjoyment vs efficiency/ease of fractal.
---
Regardless of which build you play, you'll use your F2 and F3 tomes quite often.
---
I figured it out. You unlock it by talking to Hasara again
---
Actually the normal crystal was mentioned in patch notes as well.
---
https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes/ [&amp;AmRPPwEA]
---
I don't know why they won't just remove the time-gate and turn the 25 quartz conversion into a refinement recipe that you can do as much as you want.
---
Celestial is the only stat type afaik that has a time-gated refinement process like this.
---
Yeah it’s pretty sad, but it was really fun talking to you! Keep flying!!
---
Still haven't tested it yet
---
Envoys?
---
Can confirm
---
You just made my day.
---
No wich is really shit tbh. And i don't even really raid in this game. My former MMO i was hardcore PvE raider and there was not only world first achivement but also a server wide message telling what guild that did it and what boss. This brought a lot of congratulations to the guilds in server chats and was a positive thing over all.  
---
I don't get why GW2 do not have this.
---
Ad Infinitum CMs and 99 and 100 CMs are two completely different concepts. 99 and 100 have different mechanics required from their normal t4 counterparts. If you tried to fake kp your way into one, you'd be outed immediately if you fake the knowledge fast enough. 
---
Occasionally I see people offering to train CMs, which is probably your best bet, or trying to start your own group.
---
I mean you're not wrong about this and considering I haven't gotten a chance to actually raid the new wing yet (will get to in 30min!  hype!) it's hard for me to directly one to one compare this raid's mechanics with previous ones.  But I guess that's also a potential issue with it; if they only have an amalgamation of re-used mechanics to the point where it's incredibly easy and not creative enough to warrant Day 1 difficulty, it sounds like a waste of the 10 month wait between raids.
---
I just finished the Minstrel, that required like 20 stack of elder wood as well...
---
It's time we get some name plates over the "doors".
---
The whole aerodrome looks like it's under construction.
---
Too bad he isn't warrior. You could see his mighty Hundred Blades and Arc Divider in action then. Hilarious.
---
Gonna be a godsend for guild wvw runs who have locked squads to anyone who isn't in their guilds! :)
---
Bought skin, looks pretty amazing in Glint's Ambition and Shadow Abyss. No purple for me.
---
A quick glance over your posting history supports the theory that the last time you enjoyed something was 1972.
---
Violet Beauregarde Infusion
---
I justed tested the 2 items we have plus the divinations:
---
pre + ?? + ?? + ??
---
XX divinations + Gift of Complex Emotions + ?? + ??
---
That is what I can see ingame atm with the mf. Take this as a hint.
---
Training Guilds
---
Yeah first three items are from the raid. I have no idea how to start the logbook nor where to mediate (hard to try without the logbook)...
---
I only onlt the 3 twisted essences. No idea where to get the Worn meditation logbook or the remaining purified ones :/
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrMdiKeEehA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrMdiKeEehA)
---
Agreed.  
---
Warclaw is not bad for roaming, its bad for ganking.
---
I'll be sure to look into the wiki and vids so at least I'm not clueless. Honestly I've only really seen the rare open CMs, not training. If I do it enough, I'll learn the mechanics and be in the scene. I understand I will get kicked pretty quickly the first ten times, but once I learn it, what's the difference?
---
Hopefully the end justifies the means.
---
Oh yes!! The credit card infusion
---
Additionally, time-gated materials allow players to actually make a profit from crafting.
---
If you look at the screenshot I posted you can add in the "Balls of Dark Energy", they are the 3rd component of that recipe.
---
You can use the gift from W6 plus LDs, I haven't found the other two items yet
---
&gt;Outfit
---
My hype has now receded into the sand like an ostrich head.
---
I've had these exact same hopes! Perfect for an underwater expansion! Especially since some traits affect underwater weapons, the new elites would actually run the old trait lines that have those effects.
---
I don't have a problem with pretty, but it seems a bit overdesigned and tacky (like 90% of armours and items in this game).
---
I wanted something simpler and plainer with bigger eyes ala night fury or something along those lines.
---
"Gift of Complex Emotions + Legendary Divination + Balls of Dark Energy + ?????. Proof: https://imgur.com/GdiXtuJ
---
More sources of quickness
---
More sources of alacrity
---
More viable healing options
---
More viable tank options (not just damage reduction or high health, but blocks and dodges like mes, in addition to group utility)
---
Basically more choices than just Chrono/Druid or Quickbrand/Alacregade
---
Best way would be to start your own group in LFG, or better yet find a guild/training guild or group of friends to do it with.
---
1: Do all three raid bosses  
---
2: Get a meditation logbook from Hasana (found at the Abbadon statue in the Desolation)  
---
3: Interact with the Strange Energy at the Griffon Sanctuary  
---
4: Patience!
---
Please tell me how this was done. I seek to replicate.
---
I'm kinda digging this look.
---
After you did all three raidbosses you can interact with strange energy at the griffon sanctuary. That'll complete the collection!
---
It seems they do.
---
I just want to know a relize date of 5th season for now.
---
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnDEy7T7L7c&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I agree. It is unfortunate, but in gw2 time gating seems to be  the only way to give materials and crafted items value. The other way is to make crafting itself significantly harder or longer to level and specialise in.
---
Gift of Desert Mastery
---
She could be, but Given the wiki page of [E](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/E), it doesn’t feel likely, to me at least. She strikes me as a scholar more than activist, chronicling our adventures, where E is mostly described as being a cutthroat activist who mainly has stakes in Kryta.
---
You can equip the same ascended trinket when it does not say "Unique" in the description.
---
But the only ascended trinkets that are not Unique are the Mist trinkets from PvP, WvW and fractal vendors.
---
Mist trinkets also have the advantage that you can 'reforge' them for cheap, resetting their stats, but losing any upgrades you don't extra first:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Capacitor
---
It’s zerker stats so just bank it for an alt. Could be worse, could have been some crazy stat you’d never use again.
---
Those look awesome!!
---
People continue to downvote for no reason , interesting .
---
It's not, this is what shows even if you just have Aurora
---
Missing 1 essence (from qadim kill) and the energy does nothing for me so yeah you need to kill all 3 raid bosses first.
---
"Beware the danger of secrets kept."
---
Maguuma, close enough though lol.

Oh my god. I am so down for that. SO down.

I meant what material is the picture on, as in canvas or metal print. I'd love to get one. I appreciate the reply though :)
---
Ah ! Tell that to LFG. Largos Twins are a noob stomper.
---
If only they had though to make a version without the iridescent effect...  There are quite a few things in game that would seriously benefit from just removing fancy effects like that from dyeable areas.  
---
If the effect matched the chosen dye scheme instead of the base color that might be one thing...but it never does.
---
huh, an outfit which looks great on charr. nice surprise.
---
While I like the idea, PvE is already a walk in the park. Unless it'd work on bosses, should also be unstackable if it were to work on bosses, but even there... Yeah I like the idea but I fill like it doesnt apply well to our current PvE.
---
its a bean
---
as expected it looks awful, like all the eye cancer infusions in this game
---
Yes the good guys win and the bad guys lose. the end
---
Eh, yes and no. The hummingbird was the first good skin the skimmer has had after 10 or so others
---
Personally I would still prefer them as separate parts. What is the point of Transmutation Shards if all the best armors are pre-made outfits.
---
And very legal
---
Yes, but in long term you want them both with full infusion slots so it is just temporary solution.

&gt;# 06/11/2019—Late Notes
---
&gt;- The throw and catch speeds have been reduced in all three levels of the "Play catch with your skyscale" activity in the Troublesome Skyscales collection achievement.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that prevented players from crafting the Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat after unlocking the recipe.
---
Just full cleared all cms and normal modes + achieves. 
---
Left boss we did DH stack, right boss we did Scourge and Qadim we did Scourge.
---
CMs: 
---
Scourge stack forall bosses
---
I did not see the lightbulb for scale at first, and assumed that it was literally wall-sized, and now I'm rather disappointed, actually.
---
Coalescence alone will look like Aurora and Vision alone, it supposedly won’t have a unique effect. It’s not a lie, being broken wouldn’t mean discovering a brand new effect, I’d think that would combine the Aurora and the double trinket effects in a glitchy way. 
---
Sadly I’m convinced the 3 trinket effect is going to be the huge space turd, it’s been in the game since the Vision patch (the patch which also added Coalescence into the game, we know that thanks to the datamine.) 
---
Something must have bugged with this latest patch, because even with 1 trinket on, swapping a map upgrades the effect. 
---
0 map swap = Yellow balls
---
1 map swap = pink lava lamp (which is confirmed to be Aurora + Vision combined) 
---
2 map swaps = black space glob (so by that logic, this MUST be Aurora + Vision + Coalescence combined) 
---
Even relogging doesn’t help, I unequipped Aurora but it didn’t help... the black glob is stuck above my head for an eternity.
---
Wasn't he the dude that screwed the leather market?
