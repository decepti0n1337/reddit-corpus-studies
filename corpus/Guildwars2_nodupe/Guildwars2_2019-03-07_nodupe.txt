It's righteously strong and makes duo roaming ridiculously. Can have one person hold aggro, one disengage, mount, chase, pounce, instant finish if they're below the HP threshold of ~2.8k.
---

---
The worst part is it just widens the gap between veterans and new players.
---
---
---
I would just have the mount lose endurance in enemy territory.  That would prevent jumps, and give defenders a chance to catch up to people on mounts.
---
Fuck, who can keep track anymore.  Seems like the spec has to relearn everything every balance patch.
---
Either everything is ok to say or nothing is.

With no potions and in eotm, 22 hours. in normal borderlands 17 hours. With boosters like 6-7 hours.

[Us hoarders do.](https://i.imgur.com/xH3NXCY.png) It's a good way to waste space in your inventory and ensure you're always over encumbered.
---
It's a little handy when holidays or events roll around with a special reward track that you just want to whip out and get back to your usual track without worrying about whether you'll have enough time.

Watching WvW gameplay without those aids scourge aoes is a complete different experience.
---
yeah I've of this kyle the savage, great guy
---
What was the new WvW update?
---
Just ignore them if theyre whispering you then block and report. other than that grow some thick skin and it wont bother you.
---
There were full queue on a single "very high" server. Actually, the queue were higher than when we were linked.
---
Why? Does tanks and vehicles now slow down when you enter a enemy zone? Not really, sure an enemy could build barricades but that slows him just as much down as it slows down you.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Then from a gameplay standpoint you want objectives to be capturable when the you have beaten the enemy in his fort. They already have shorter distances due to teleporters and gliding. I don't see a reason why they should be even quicker at their objective after failing a defence. This will just lead to endless defences where you just have to give up since enemy is countlessly getting back within seconds.
---
For a wee moment there I thought, going by the title, that you'd gotten fed up with Chrono changes and turned them into a bag opener, haha
---
They're to gear up any builds I want to test in WvW since it gives me access to most any stat combinations (The [Triumphant Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_armor) is better if you're wanting to do this, mind you) and to complete the achievements since I was only missing 26 more Bounty Hunter and/or Warbeast armors.
---
If you're thinking about large scale wvw then rev is your best choice, but daredevil can also be strong in some situations. All 3 work great in roaming and pvp and can be quite bursty.
---
Test them all in pvp lobby and see which one you like the most.
---
Quality PvE content. 
---
Ohhh I was just meaning in relation to teams. They need to do something to make pseudo pro teams again. 
---
Not the hot mess that’s is 5v5 solo. 
---
that's literally what you did there, my dude 9\_9
---
Sorry, what? Team is 5 players. You can go random with others ot with a team. It was on before, but many lonely people were not happy to play agains premade teams. So they decided to punish everyone else. Yes, Mmr works for a time being. Problem is many new players can easily end up in platinum by just winning placement games by luck, or getting strong teammates by luck. I met many of those, who doesn't even know that yoi don't need 2 players to cap close etc., you not jumping on monster hunt and ignoring point at start etc. So why would many other players, who used to simply enjoy playing in team, should be punishes by yet another RNG gift from Anet? There is the reason PvP is almost dead and not many players left who still play it...if you can manipulate games in top 100...dude, it tells it all.
---
Easier solution:
---
* Place a "exclusion zone" around every tower and keep. No enemy mounts and gliding allowed, they get fired at by some NPC ballistas and dismounted.
---
* These new exclusion zones would be shaped like the objectives, unlike the current "square fill" model.
---
* Everything outside the exclusion zones is considered neutral, and you can glide and use mounts normally.
---
I've done everything bad
---
But wait, can you still bypass tower and keep gates?  Or was that patched too?

In the game still 10 targets 
---
As a holosmith Roamer, I am unable  to gank anyone on a warclaw, I just can't pull out 12k burst on someone with 3 dodges and with CC immunity. This ruins it for me. The warclaw needs to somehow react to CC, like have a visible breakbar.
---
I am already at a disadvantage by being the one engaging someone with  extra 12k hp.
---
Reporting that this *doesn't* happen to me, and I play every race except Human (and use my shrine guardian on all my characters). So if it's always happening for OP and never for me, there's some weird third factor
---
As a counterpoint, why would you want to lose your participation while you're there? 
---
I measured it at 15 minutes for WvW, 45 minutes for open world PvE, and something like 3 hours for instances.
---
The terrain was not updated.
---
The queue already died in my server.   
---
At not more than 10 pm (GMT+1), the only map that had the queue was EBG. (It always does)  
---
The other maps hadn't a commander, nor had anyone interested at completing anything. 
---
I honestly expect that the situation will return as usual in less than few more days.  
---
Thanks!
---
He named the character thin gruel, and orphans traditionally are known for being fed really bland food like gruel. 
---
Agree. But those 5 solo could try to be motivated in building their team/s and becoming better instead of hoping that someone will carry them. I staryed from solo, I was playing many solo games even when team queues were allowed, I made many friends like this, you would get few good players in the team, you would team up, go to discord etc. Almost all raiding teams started like this, a game is promoting teamwork after all. And if you want solo game, make 1v1 arena with less reward until 5 death etc qirh same class queueing. In wvw if another server can't team up and being smashed by the server with commander, they would usually try to organize themselves, even some random people would start leading and trying to learn. Game is about making friends and teamwork...not much team play without a team.
---
Probably reduce the distance it leaps.. but even now it's like a half ass jackal.
---
Funnily enough their stealth just got significantly nerfed too
---
well, it's shit now
---
Next stage pip farming:
---
If you finished at least the wooden chest, you will get 1 extra pip for each tick in the following week.
---
So if you want to farm pips as well be sure to play at least enough to get the last wooden chest each week ;) 
---
I like using it but now I have people getting on my case for using chain pull because it's not optimal use of supplies. Like, hey man, I'm just trying to get that sweet +1 AP.
---
Where's /u/Grimjack8130 to make the Warclaw into some npc monstrosity?
---
Thanks
---
Weird, I've certainly paid a lot of money for a game that is free to play.
---
I guess its fine now, its still good to engange when people got stuck in a bomb to finish them quickly, but not to wipe a complete zerg if 10 people jump in.
---
love this show! enjoy!
---
I think it should be reduced to 1 target, and prioritize down players.  Nontheless, happy to see it brought to a more realistic level. I'm not against mounts in WvW, I just think it needs to be nerfed a lot.
---
Good, less mount driven fights.
---
Removal of Warclaw would be the appropriate nerf.
---
It was overpowered. 3 is enough.
---
Honestly, this achievement made me really sick and tired of Draconis Mons. It was fine until I had to spend two weeks there doing the same four hearts every day. If it was different things every day, I think it'd be better, but I really hated the repetition. 
---
Also, while doing the bosses once isn't too bad, if you do Aestus and/or Ignus earlier for the Draconis Mons Hero, you have to re-do them for a henge away from home if the achievement wasn't active, and catching the *right* boss (since maps now can only do one or the other) is a pain. 
---
I was actually discouraged from taking new characters in, too- for me, it'd been so long since I started that map that I didn't remember how to actually *get* anywhere without waypoints, and since I just wanted to get the hearts done and get on with my life, only one of my characters did that map. 
---
Also, I really, really think the music in Draconis Mons didn't help at all. It's not nearly as good as music in other parts of the game- the low-pitched "DUUUUUUNNNNN..... DUUUUUUUNNN..... DUUUUUUNNNN...." gets really annoying a lot faster than other music. 
---
In the end, though, it is up to personal preference. I just prefer that, if you're going to have to spend a long amount of time in one area, you don't have to do the same thing every single day. I really liked the setup of achievements for All or Nothing (once all the bugs were out)- instead of having to do the same thing over and over (like the Wayfarer's Henge), or having to do a few very hard things (like a lot of Season 2), it was mostly a set of smaller achievements focusing on different events and, like you mentioned, getting to know the map. 
---
&gt;  not in the way everyone is **hopping**.
---
I see what you did there.  Cuz the mount leaps .. hops.. good one :P

this is the on I think we need though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfbKaElB_4U

Has the Perfect Fit achievo for catmander rooms been fixed yet?
---
I don't think their intention was having the siege ability to be the same or better than a ram, but just a "help" to people already ramming. About this, I think they are right, or else rams would be obliterated to space.
---
Oh, how so? 
---
No.
---
No it definitely doesn't need to be as good as a ram of course. I feel like 3 players with max supply on a paper tower gate should still do a good amount of damage on it though. Maybe like a charr car which is good on lower tier gates and walls but becomes pretty worthless once it's t2.

I'll keep that in mind! I haven't done fractals in a while due to my hands. I've been scared to get back into them because all of my fractal friends have stopped playing. :(

I'm currently on Maguuma! I wanted to go to Dragonbrand to be with my wvw friend again but I can't afford to switch.

My take on it is that this is just a way to represent the defender's advantage. Knowing your turf makes a big difference. Have you ever been chased down but it was your area so it was OK because you knew where to run to?

IDK, I like it but ANet always neglects it. =(

No one wants to have a conversation or a discussion with someone that's constantly back-peddling and editing their responses.  "It's a rhetorical question," ~~hurrdurr,~~ is a lame and disrespectful way to shutdown a conversation, and to top it off, it makes you sound like a dick.  If you have anything to add to your post do it in the body of the post itself.  Your post should speak for itself, but clearly it didn't inspire anything new or add anything of value to an existing topic or discussion.

GW2 Reddit community in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.
---
Personally I can only comment on this as someone that uses the Druid specialisation in Fractals.  For Fractals, the party composition is always king.  Support and CC are always lacking in Fractal pug groups.  For this reason, Druid is still viable in Fractals.  
---
One of nicer things about the patch changes is that the active skills for non-elite spirits no longer kill the spirit as well as teleport the spirit to the player.  So as long as the spirit is alive, you can keep using the active skill.  This essentially allows the active spirit skill to also function also an additional DPS/CC skill with a 20 second cool down.  
---
I tested this out during a legendary bounty yesterday with Stone Spirit.  Even with no healing power, I was able to keep the Stone Spirit alive for the entire boss fight.  I was also able to use the active skill every 20 seconds during the entire boss fight, which worked out surprisingly well.  
---
Personally I think one of the things we might see for Fractals in the near future are Ranger builds that take advantage of the active spirit skills.  For example, the traited version of the Storm Spirit active skill does more than 2k damage to nearby enemies as well as provide breakbar damage and AOE Fury to nearby allies (and has a 20 second cool down).  Some like that would be very useful for boss fights where the boss has to be killed quickly or fights where there are lots of adds.  
---
I was actually agreeing with you until you reach the last sentence then you again fell flat on the ground by being passively agressive.

Timegating content is anti-consumer/anti-gamer, because it is strictly prohibiting players from being able to play when they want to play arbitrarily. It serves no purpose to timegate this collection other than to make it take longer, there is nothing at all about this content that provides any value to spread it out over the course of 2 weeks. Repeatedly farming the same 4 hearts every day for 2 weeks is boring. It stops being interesting after the first time.
---
If you do decide to sell, probably better to instant sell instead of listing it. I'd imagine interest on a legendary water weapon would be lower compared to a surface weapon, because the latter can be shown off while AFK-ing. 
---
Tortoise!

That's quality QA!
---
Something challenging with varying rewards and obstacles, something is more mentally engaging than spamming skills in desperation to end the monotony of killing harmless trash mobs for heart quests 
---
The new banners trigger boss encounters when placed nearby. Can be viewed at the final boss of the Chaos fractal.
---
Not wanting something to be pointlessly timegated to repeating the exact same monotony of 4 heart quests every day for 2 weeks is not the same thing as wanting everything handed to us on the first day wtf?
---
Thank you so much! Take a leave!
---
zergs will probably  e much more compact now, since speed buffs, leaps etc dont spread them out anymore as much
---
Since you can duel and can change your WvW build there it makes sense to me.  You don’t get participation, but you also don’t lose it either so that is a plus.  
---
These maps weren´t made fpr mounts... just remove them
---
mounts.
---
The first mount you get as part of the very first PoF story mission, which you can ask someone at level 80 to carry you through even when you're not level 80
---
Once you have a mount, it's account wide
---
Only 2000?
---
What a bargain!
---
I remember you from like 2 months ago bitching about gemstore stuff. It looks like thats all you do lol why are you even still here? Just to be toxic about a game you obviously don't enjoy for months on end?

I see merit to your arguments after this point, but I gotta say if you hover over the downvote icon "Downvoting comment because you disagree with it is against the reddiquette" or in other words downvoting is not disagree button. I know its often used that way but it doenst have to be.

* Reduced the maximum number of targets on the warclaw’s Battle Maul skill from 10 to 3. Reduced the damage of Battle Maul by 26% in WvW.  
---
:(
---
&gt; The time-gating is annoying but manageable, 16 days isn't really a whole lot. 
---
This is really the whole thing that people hate. Everything else was great, but having to do every heart a day for a bare minimum of 16 days kind of burns out a lot of people. You didn't seem to have this effect, but a lot of folks did. There also wasn't any mounts at the time, so that could have influenced things well.
---
If it were half that, I doubt people would complain. But doing the same thing over and over can tire people out of content.
---
I would also like more collections like this, just without a "you need to do 4 different hearts a day for 16 days if you want to minimize your time-gating". Hearts aren't really entertaining content, though they've certainly gotten better than core hearts.

Since it is technically part of an expansion it's hard to call it p2w. It'd be like saying the latest wow expansion is p2w because a max level character can easily kill base game characters. I know their expansion and pay models are different but it's still a nice comparison.
---
 An expansion should be considered part of the full package of an mmo, something you should really need to achieve the full experience the devs have worked hard to make.
---
Last time I played was when they released the last expansion so its been awhile and I come back to two of my characters boosted to max lvl wtf? I honestly forgot what level I was before I quit but I don't remember being max level
---
Not sure if it was like this prior, but depending on your concentration %, SOI shows in seconds the increase. I had 96% concentration and it showed 5.9 or so seconds. Ate my food to get 100% and it went to 6 seconds.  Pretty sure it was always at 5 seconds no matter what your concentration was prior.
---
Damn, I noticed that when playing too. That's pretty big as well, but that's how I originally expected it to behave when they announced it anyway.
---
As long as they don't make the same change to [[Finishing Blow]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Finishing_Blow) as well, I'm happy.
---
It's like oatmeal but with less flavor. 
---
The moment I saw that leap I knew it was a problem. Mirage has a skill that can be used while on air and it changes the direction that you're moving, it was enough to break a lot of things in WvW. A leap like that is very likely to be a problem.  
---
Anet needs to be more careful about this stuff.
---
The money will actually go towards jumping puzzles and Black Lion consumables.  
---
Not really liking the attitude here, and I think you misunderstand me. By standing behind the group and casting shield 5, the return wave will hit group before your SoI. So only you need to take a step forward as you're behind the group to start with. Or can always just accept the 7 sec loss of alacrity cause you have over 100% uptime anyways.

Im sorry, but, im insulting the people that doesnt wanna learn, not the people that ask me things about the game mode, dont get confused. }
---
Im happy that pve players come to wvw , but , like they want you to know your rotation for raids, and learn the mechanics of the bosses, im asking them to yell: HEY! Im here and im new! wanna know what is wvw about! not just keep dying and dying , thats something no one enjoys. 
---
Ps: yeah, the comunity its toxic asf sometimes, i agree with you on that one.
---
People who are in the game mode for 5-8 hours to get a mount aren't interested, necessarily, in learning basics they think they're never going to use again.
---
I run a casual PvE guild and usually I take the time to introduce new players to the basics of WvW, but not everyone in my guild is on my server, and so I can't get everyone. 
---
The issue is that people assume that it's easy to follow the tag and listen and for some people, sure it is. But there are other people for whom movement and reading text and keeping up becomes impossible.
---
Add to this the fact that some commanders get annoyed more easily than others, or people aren't used to having to follow commands running around the open world and you have the current situation.
---
The thing is, in a week or two it'll all die down anyway.  That's really want we're talking about here.
---
The upside of this is that if some of those people, even a relatively small percentage end up enjoying WvW, those people may come back and WvWer's will have new people to play with.
---
Bad case of "Not reading the OP, missing the point entirely and assuming things about the OP".

I realize that . But the other tracks ( Halloween , xmas , 4 winds ) all show under the locked tab. SAB does not. Which was why I asked. Thanks for your response.
---
Ok, as a response to your edits: yeah, youre right , yelling doesnt do anything good, but, people needs to realize that there are things to learn, not just go and die, if people dont wanna realize that, well.. .you know, theres some point you get tilted. And wvw its not that intricate tbh xD (at least the most basic things like follow the tag , try to live , and follow the orders).
---
ps: the "trolling" on teamchat were like 4 hourse after the run, just in case to clarify. 
---
About your second edit: its easy to know why the people doesnt want to stay on wvw, its a "dead" game mode (like most of the people like to call it), where many of the guilds that run doesnt teach people how to play if they are new.  We can change this, by doing tutorials, and explaing, but there are rtight now waaaay more  hardheads than ever playing wvw, i talked about that on teamspeak  and discord with some people, after this, wvw will get 10% (maybe) of the people that its playing to get the mount, as you said , people dabble on all game modes, so, cant expect me to dont tilt if the score gets heavily modified towards one server cuz people just runs to death. 
---

This is the biggest issue with stealth in the game; it lacks some of the common drawbacks that many games have implemented over the years to diminish its intrinsic power. Take for example \[old\] Evelynn when she had a 3 sec stun out of true stealth, or more recently Akali, or how they balanced rogues in WoW, or Sombra in OW, etc. 
---
Stealth in of itself is powerful enough, no matter how much you want to guess where the player went and did after the enter stealth, at the end of the day it is at best, a **guess**. For the receiving end, often times they are unaware anyone is even around them until it is too late, and in GW2, stealths come with mov increases/teleports, and neither damage nor CC breaks it, and if that wasnt enough, if you blind them or use aegis, they wont get revealed until an outgoing attack actually land on the enemy and it registers damage, so arcane shield/AoE blind/aegis wont save you from that backstab.  
---
By now some people have ~~given up~~ accepted as it currently is, but i think it can be so much better for both parties, rather than just fun for the stealthing party and frustration for the receiving side. Things like having a minimal threshold of % hp damage, and/or hard CC and/or proximity clues can make it less oneside and add a minigame of trying to reveal vs trying to avoid being revealed, and increase the skill cap on both sides.

Which is again why I love the change with the war law, being ganked when I just want to run to places is what made me ragequit wvw over and over and over and over again.. so to have a way to just run away is the solution to finally enjoy wvw for me. 
---
Kinda made me think of how it would be kinda cool to have a just a few actual jumping puzzles that get you into keeps and what not. I really enjoyed the border lands jp and obsidian sanctum one back in the day.
---
It's more than that, though. It's not about retaining 10%, it's about retaining players that dabble in WvW in the future. That's why the mount is so important. Now that people have a way of getting to the zerg, they will be far more likely to stay longer when they dabble in WvW.
---
Can people stop posting those? It's an exploit. Send it to exploits@arena.net instead.
---
So first off the game doesn't automatically use your boosters, if you think they were used and you did not do so it might be a good idea to check your account security and maybe change your password just to be safe since the only way they get used is if someone used them. Secondly in PvP you get upscaled to level 80 automatically while there so you may be confusing the two. While in sPvP your armor and weapon stats are ignored and it only matters that you have them equipped, all stats are controlled by the special PvP amulet you have in your PvP build (top middle of your screen while in PvP lobby). 
---
So again, you could take a brand new level 2 character into sPvP and they would be on even footing with every other character there (assuming you put on any level/rarity weapons/gear). The arah weapon boxes can give you your choice of weapons from that dungeon with a selection of stats (Berserker, Knight, Rabid). If you only ever sPvP it won't matter what stats you pick (or if you pick at all) and will just be the look of your weapon. If you decide to go into PvE or WvW then it takes your gear into account and you'll want the correct stats. I would suggest selecting berserker on whatever weapon you decide on since it is the best power stats for PvE and while marauder would be preferable in WvW berserker is the same without some defense.

There are 4 dailies you have on your account, but there can be more than 4 possible ones for any given day - for example, accounts that don't have access to expansions, or don't have a high enough level character, get replacement dailies for things they can't do. The restrictions for each daily are shown on the right side of the card, and the cards themselves are sorted roughly the same way the game picks them, so if you just go left to right and pick the first four your account qualifies for, it's likely you'll get the same four you would see in-game.
---
yeah yeah all know about Kung Fu Tea, which is not the same as the company above. 
---
there is nothing to fix
---
Bro wvw has been sending that kind of stuff forever and it was never fixed in wvw, those kind of exploits are not new
---
Yes, isn't that wonderful?
---
Lets not go there again.
---
But heres a story: GW2 and some bubble tea company had a promo where you could get the Dragon t shirt outfit (wanted by many players) and some bundle that would upgrade a F2P account to a standard account but without expansions. It would basicly lift F2P restrictions. So pretty usefull.
---
Due to the amount of players the app where you got the codes you could redeem for the stuff crashed. But also because of a huge amount of bots that tried getting those outfit/bundles (for selling them on Ebay, once again, people wanted that outfit badly so easy profit for some). This resulted in tons of actual players not being able to get anything.
---
The bubble tea company said they were plagued by hackers, but it was really just the sheer amount of bots that caused issues. Their way to fix it was to make it NA only and exclude EU. At the start of the Promo it was said it was for both NA and EU. Funnily enough, players in the EU could still redeem their codes for stuff after that if they already had them. I personally got my codes after that and I was in EU and could still redeem them.
---
For the promo you also had to link your social media to that app. It was also a way to steal that info from you. Many people made throwaway accounts though, like you should have for this horrible promo.
---
The app where you got the codes was a horrible mess as well. Everytime you tried to get the codes you would get an error. However, after a few days the initial rush for the codes calmed down and people started getting the rewards... for every single time you got that error you got new codes. People spammed that button like crazy (I did too) and eventually ended up with many codes. I ended up with over 50 and just gave them away to others. Many players didnt get anything though.

That corner specifically has been fixed before. Last time was when DH came out and the F2 could leap over. That is why the corner looks so weird. I could be fixed with moving the outer wall a bit more out taking the outer corner away from attempting to look like a 45deg angle.

\- Hohoo, then come as close as you like!

It would be enough of a connection to think of GW2 when I would see this in RL, so I do understand the OP. But you are right. Maybe there is something in all brands of that tea... :)

I didn't even do it on purpose... It just happened and I analyzed why. But that's the classical reddit troll. Assuming things nobody ever said...

Mine is just named Haha Yeet.

This needs more upvotes, it's in his own region so he moves faster.

Soon, Chat is nice and WvW focused. 
---
I noticed this too and it feels so damn awful now, kinda kills the joy of joining into a new fight by jumping in to finish people, no wexp/loot from finishes like that, only counts for achievement :(
---
it's a tamed and enslaved charr 
---
I wonder why there is no dolyak skin 
---
Be kind? Lmao this ia reddit and you're not sucking anet off. Be ready for downvotes.
---
more like: ppl wanted a tree-house but anet gave them a tire swing 
---
7 seconds? What are you talking about?
---
For mimic builds, bringing WoA means significantly less alacrity uptime - no matter if you count that first SoI towards it or not. You'd need at least 50% BD with DT builds. Imo its not worth it. So you go with WoR and 1 TW, thats something between 30% and 35% BD for DT builds. That means your missing 3 seconds alacrity from first SoI on your opener CS dont matter because you need more boon duration for quickness anyway.
---
And on 2 well builds... if you go for the very simplified version with precasting both wells and using only shield5+signet in your first CS, then you need what... 10% more boon duration on DT builds compared to a tryhard opener squeezing shield5, 2 wells and signet in there. So 45% instead of 35%. As I stated above, not something I would even remotely consider doing in a pug, but then only there I run 2 wells really.
---
If you insult people or "say bad words" to other people, yes, this is toxic.
---
You don't have to like their commitment to the game mode but you should respect it. If they are there only for the mount then wait a week and they are gone, they have their mount and you don't have to deal with them. Simple as that.
---
And it is not "getting carried" in WvW really because for what the mount requires to unlock you don't even need a damn squad or other players who show you how it is done, they just follow you because they don't have a clue how it is done.
---
I can understand the criticism but be more patient. The patch came out not even two full days ago so of course you will have players who don't have a damn clue and will only know the PvE playstyle. Those who are only there for the mount will be gone in a week, those who are willing to stay will stay and learn how WvW is played and being a dick about it doesn't help the situation at all.
---
&gt; Maybe a trap or disable that forces you off your mount or stops you in your tracks.
---
DH wvw meta hype?
---
Only warrior doesn't have it as one of the 2 go to weaponsets for power DPS, and even so, spellbreaker DPS uses it fairly often in general pve, and core warrior can bring it to fractals if cc is not an issue. 
---
Most people liking using greatswords, cuz it's cooler for them  to use a gigantic sword than waving a little scepter or trying to stab people with your butter knife. Also the sunrise/twilight/eternity trio of legendary greatswords are probably the most popular sets.
---
I am the Firebrand and leader of PLS. Right click on your Alt+Shift+T panel and click on the BIG ARROW on Area Stats. Proceed to select +1 and when the NEW window opens, Right click on it and select Advanced. I want to want you the more you cleanse/strips etc the more likely you will crash. The rate in which PLS strips and crash tend to net me ArcDPS crash errors often so take note.
---
I know it's a joke but maybe some insight from a general software development  perspective:
---
that's probably just their classification for release types. they have regular, scheduled releases on Tuesdays, bug fixes during the week with limited testing and hotfixes whenever but only touching as little as possible as they probably don't test hotfixes that much.
---
I know, I know, their testing is not all that great anyway, but I'm mostly talking how software projects often run. I only ever pushed minute but very critical (as in the company basically stopped) changes completely without tests, if they were just urgent we usually had some testing of the affected area but no regression tests to look for unintended side effects. and for normal releases of course we would test the new functionality and make sure everything else still worked.
---
Thank you.
---
Do you mean the more I cleanse/strip in a single fight or overall over the time in wvw?
---
If chain pull could pull players, that'd be kind of funny
---
excellent, should've been that way. 
---
It's not like power chronos are using both weapon sets. Most roll S/S and GS just to have a ranged option. 
---
People have been doing that for years for WvW exploits. They will never get fixed because ANet doesn't prioritize WvW. But this concerns a PvE mount so maybe, MAYBE they will actually look at the report.
---
As someone else pointed out in another thread you can get a mount spoiler free via WvW now. Also the expansion unlocks new elite specializations which you can use in sPvP.
---
300 Kasmeres, give or take
---
you're expected to have at least exotic gear, ascended is desired
---
check out discretize and snowcrows for fractal/raid builds
---
My favourite part is where I kill Twitchy Jake so fast his dialogue plays out even after he's already dead.
---
And yes when I got to Mists I did tell Kormir he sent me. 
---
&gt;The more popular they are talked about the more likely they get fixed. So the more these exploits are spread around, the quicker they get to fixing them.
---
I don't think you read my post tho..I don't think ya'll know how neglected WvW actually is. We literally had Maguuma abuse the door jumps (still not fixed btw) in front of the dev in our server, over and over the whole time he was on. 
---
&gt;we have more people actively working on WvW atm.
---
That's pure speculation. WvW has never had many people working on it, not even when the game was at its peak. 
---
That's with your territory speed boost. Enemies can not do this.
---
I always felt that that line wasn't really him bragging about his crimes, but actually a subtle cry for help. A lamentation of his descent into banditry as his dreams were subverted and shunted aside by his poor choice in comrades and lack of personal strength.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
As a programmer on GW2, that screen also brings back memories for me! 
---
I -think- that the password color thing was my idea. The idea was that you could instantly know if you had typed in the right password or not based on the colors that appeared, instead of having to wait until the login server approved or rejected it.
---
Why yes, a riedeable Cheshire Cat would actually be an insta-buy for me. Thanks sparking a dream that'll most likely never come true...
---
I always thought it was a joke about doing everything poorly, including his grammar while speaking.
---
That's where I started, and then I applied it to his life choices and it kinda went dark.
---
A bdsm cat
---
i love my GS Sunrise and thats why i use it on every class which can use it.
---
Main was Warrior now Guardian DH. Now i even can use it as Quickbrand.
---
Flair checks out
---
He means due to the rate of cleanses / corrupt it increases the likelyhood of a game crash. So be careful with how many windows you open. It's reset after each fight. 
---
The FASTER you do it. Every window adds to the possibility. I had to lower my game to best performance to not crash. 
---
I normally run on High. 
---
On high I crash with the 20% stats of that fight in 10 men groups haha. ARC IS super flawed but I hope I helped. I reduce the display too since it did help 
---
The servers are right where they need to be. Constantly full, and fights happening at all hours of the day. No such thing as "prime time" right now.
---
there's also limited stealth, like the old engie sneak gyro, where they don't know exactly where the enemy is but you have an idea where they are in general. Allows for the stealthed player to juke stuff etc. But also presents counterplay
---
If it kills thiefs coming out of nowhere, doing few fast attacks and returning to stealth, then it's more than okay for me. 
---
I've been using the GS for most of the 250 hours I've played with my power mesmer/chrono (not any meta build, just what I find the most fun for me)
---
The movement speed isn't a factor here, it's purely based on the leap. I did it last night in an enemy keep, it's pretty damn easy too where as the QL jump is a little more difficult.
---
I came as a PvE only player for the mount. Every WvW players worst nightmare basically. As I've played I've been picking up more and more. After a couple hours I was farming reward track with the best of em. I'm actually really enjoying WvW and feel like it's something I could/would do more often after getting the mount. Thing is, I'm more of a casual player. I would be only doing WvW a couple days a week while I still played PvE the rest. I feel like I need to get my mount and get out or else I'll face the wrath of the WvW community. It would actually be nice if some of the experienced players would open up to the idea that some of us really like WvW and would like to come back once in a while without taking shit for it. The WvW and PvP communities treating casual players like trash is what pushed me to PvE in the first place. 
---
yea, I haven't gotten it yet but that's always been my biggest gripe with the mode - it takes soooo long to get anywhere, so I can't wait to unlock the mount! 
---
Exotic gear is the yellow gear right? Just got back from a 3 year break and I didn't know my char came already equipped with a whole set of yellows(character was boosted to max and I don't remember doing so)not sure if its any good or not. Can I use that or do I have to replace it asap?
---
Not broken until it solos a raid boss.
---
&gt; The Warclaw will mean that players like me will spend more time in WvW
---
this assumption is what the WvW crowd seem to mainly have been contesting
---
This Flerken is a little fat but he would make a fine mount.
---
the difference to you is that I dont need to get a point across because I am not complaining about the status quo.
---
The guild I'm in has someone that updates the daily message with quick tips and links to do the dailies, including the list of PSNA stuff. Small but invaluable feature that I've always appreciated.
---
Looks more a FatClaw.
---
If "everywhere you go" is mostly across open world, then yeah. Greatsword, on every class that can use it, tends to be very strong for open world.
---
Greatsword in general is centered around having high burst damage, AoE or at least cleave, and CC. Three very important things to carry with you when you're running around open world.
---
On mesmer, it is their strongest ranged option; on warrior and ranger, it adds a lot of mobility; on guardian, it's complete bonkers; and on necromancer, it's just their least bad power weapon.
---
Depends on what u like to do the most,I enjoy crafting,so the legendary pursuit is my end game right now.
---
gold technically, yellow is rare. It is the stuff that the boost gave you, but that's probably soldier's stats, which isn't really all that useful anywhere
---
For most dps classes in fractals, you probably want berserker's stat exotics
---
No i'm talking about dcing every 10 minutes, i wasn't having issues until i had to restart the game earlier
---
What exactly is dead about roaming? That it’s harder for a fully geared out roamer to kill some poor unsuspecting elementalist with bad gear trying to catch up to their zerg?
---
sorry to say, i hope this game can shutdown. my bro had been playing non stop and dont want to work. we cant do anything to him. only can pray for him as his future is a lost. 
---
Portal largos :/, doesn't he get enraged at last 25?
---
We've got better yes. But you're telling me even training raids can do so now. That's what's shocking me.
---
:O
---
1 Target is too low. Probably every melee skill in game has 3 targets, so having it to be 3 targets as well is just right.
---
Well... Yeah. When you started, you were like a training run except without the leader who knows the encounter thoroughly and the experienced volunteers who hop in. Training runs are *incredibly rarely* nine fresh beginners and one leader. The run I did today only had two people that were entirely new to Gorseval, and only one who was in her first week of raiding. Two of my support players, a druid and the tank, were experienced with Gorseval but had never played those specialized roles before. If every DPS player in the squad was outputting numbers equal to the two total beginner DPS players, we'd have *definitely* done updrafts, but as it stood we were able to get a clear with slow break alone.
---
Then you should probably tell whoever is doing that about this :)
---
i wouldnt call "using the warclaw jump to get on the inner wall" an exploit. thats literally what we've been doing with raptors since pof release. anet has clearly missed this and i have no clue how...
---
New maps. Instead, reuse and revitalize old maps.
---
&gt; Training runs are incredibly rarely nine fresh beginners and one leader.
---
I had this feeling too nowadays.
---
That would make jumping over water quite useless and unnatural.
---
The first jump is absolutely possible in enemy territory. I did it earlier, though felt like it was a little chancy.
---
[https://youtu.be/Tyb74P3o1uU](https://youtu.be/Tyb74P3o1uU)
---
Please stop using casual as an excuse for bad. Its insulting towards casual players. 
---
You complain from your perspective. You die and the game doesn't cater to you. But you choose to play a pvp mode. You admit you're awful on your own, so you join groups but even that is too hard. 
---
So I ask the following. Do you consider how the zergs you chase feel about having you? Because in all honesty, you're just holding them back for your own gain. By making the game better for you they make it worse for those commanders and groups you want to follow. But you don't consider anyone but yourself. 
---
What casuals like you need is more elitism in alliances. You need tiers where the good players play together, so that worse players don't get abused by them 24/7. Just like in other games you split people based on skill. 
---
Because in all honesty, anet cannot make a design that makes pvp forgiving for genuine bad players as long as players of all skill play against each other. You'll always be at the bottom of the food chain no matter what they add or change. 
---
As far as bugs go we wouldn't be this annoyed if they weren't the exact same issues as we've had what, 5 times before? If you add the same bugs 5 times over you're incompetent or plain not interested. 
---
You talk about coding bugs yet half these jumps were in the game after HoT, after gliding update, base game with weaponswap leaps, ...
---
Valkyrie is a good mix of damage and survivability. Honestly, you could do worse.
---
My advice: head into fractals, say you're new to them (people are mostly helpful in T1 fractals if you say you're new) and do your best. 
---
Tempest is less value in 5man, if you have a power soulbeast, renegade/firebrand combo with one of them healer bring more defensive boons like stab, aegis and resistance, and wayyyy better cc.
---
&gt; And it is not "getting carried" in WvW really because for what the mount requires to unlock you don't even need a damn squad or other players who show you how it is done, they just follow you because they don't have a clue how it is done.
---
It is when you ask for shared participation while doing nothing though. I've done a fair bunch of gifts of battle, but I'm not a WvW player at all, so I don't bother joining squads. It's only being honest with yourself.
---
Gotcha, thanks any last tips for fractals? 
---
Also as a place that counts as WvW, you can go there and swap builds, visit vendors, and check your theory craft without risking participation loss or contributing to map cap
---
More stats combination and food recipe
---
Weeklies were never a thing. Monthlies were a thing but they weren't that much different than what you have for dailies now. Here is a list of what Monthlies consisted of (from the wiki [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Monthly))
---
* Killing Champions
---
* Doing fractals
---
* Complete dailies
---
* Doing dungeons
---
* Do events
---
* Crafting
---
* Salvaging
---
* WvW Player kills
---
* Jumping Puzzles
---
* PvP wins
---
* Get Skill points
---
* Veteran Slayer
---
and more.
---
Though, you already do have weeklies, sort of, with the weekly reset on WvW, Raids and Guild missions you can keep track of your own Weeklies. Or you could do Random dailies each week.
---
I always chuckle about "Unique rewards" because, what is really unique for you? Something you can only get through weeklies? Get it once and it is not unique anymore! What will the droprate be? If it is low then you are spending months trying to get that specific item, sounds fun right?! What about selling it on the TP, you surely want that. Not unique anymore, because you don't even have to do the Weekly to get those items. Sooner or later it will be just the same as everything else and you will cry for "better rewards".
---
Dont pay attention to them. This will mostly get ignored and not downwoted. Start is always rough when some specific people are been rude to every single one post here. You will get used to it with time ;).   
---
Also people didnt wanted anything. Anet gave us something and people were "expecing" something else. The problem is that it was their expectation and only thir reason why they are now dissapointed. If they were not expecting something Anet didnt promised .. then they wouldnt feel mad/sad. 
---
Pretty much every class there uses it in PvE.
---
Short and mean: get your Warclaw and go back to PvE if you do not intend to learn game mode.
---
Long and meaner: you are bad, okay. You don't want to get good, I get a gist of it from your post. This does not mean that mode should change for you. Should raids have mode where players respawn after being killed and can get back to fighting boss (aka casual mode)? Maybe, maybe not, probably not or at least not with rewards given for normal mode. Mount indeed fixes a "lone running to your group" experience since one-shot thiefs no longer can just pop-up from nowhere and kill you, but "commander turns his badge off" is not a bug or a feature of the game. If commander has enough anger and frustration after trying to lead bunch of "casuals" that stand and wait when he engages, that run back when he screams to go left, then he can disable his badge and go run around with a party of his guildies killing casuals left and right. No one here is entitled to have fun provided by another players work, no matter how "casual" he is. Additionally if you cannot organize yourselves without commander, it speaks a lot. How did people play before commander tag?
---
I consider myself an amateur WvW-er. About rank 100, nothing special. But I learned this mode. I started with ranged and wondered why no one liked it. I got killed by thief out of nowhere countless times. I organized map without commander more times than I effortlessly ran after the tag. "Walk of shame"? Really? By the time I get back to my zerg I can kill a roamer or two and defend or attack a camp or two, sometimes escort dolyak giving him swiftness. WvW is not about following a commander, it's about being in constant warzone where anything you do to help your side counts.
---
If mode is not for you - don't change the mode, change what you play. GW2 has so many different modes, every player can find something for himself. 
---
Aurene. Keep her dead, please.
---
Oh no
---
You are a kind of "PvE pleb" we need and want - someone who sees fun in this game mode and is eager to learn it.
---
As for commanders - unless your server is one of the top WvW servers, you will need to work without them too... 
---
Stealth isn't a problem per second. Permastealth *out of combat* is. In-combat, thief and it's Stealth are fine. More than fine actually, they're both really weak. It's why thief has gravitated towards the oneshot builds as of late, they're the only way you're useful in WvW nowadays.
---
Why change old content so new players can't experience it anymore when you can also make new content?
---
Timegates
---
fuck off with that shit. It's annoying.
---
Yeah, Pipping down isn't a thing anymore.
---
I find these things fun. hopefully no one get banned for exploit since it's just a game. but fix please.  
---
looks a bit like last Witcher 3 DLC
---
What needs a hotfix in pvp rn? Serious question.
---
okay, if we’re talking balance, then you have to at least assume all other things are some equivalent
---
mmm interesting though. in my server no one complained about crashes and haven't encounter one myself :/ not saying that they are none but problem could always lie somewhere else. 
---
Presumably you could kill those 1000 inquest anywhere instead of in that one tiny area, though.
---
I'd rather keep new stats but there is usually no really good way to obtain them except new map, then it's being patched into legendary and very few selectable chests. 
---
Attackers are going to be much slower than defenders. If you kill a defender they have time to respawn and easily get back to most camps for a second round before the circle hits 100% to claim (especially in ABL).  
---
Tons of stats combination and food recipe are useless, i prefer a revamp than more of them
---
I didn't say change the game mode. I said that adding a Warclaw was good for the game mode because it would bring in more casual players and like it or not, the game mode will live or die through those players. A bit of mobility will not end the game as you know it. People bitched and complained about gliders in WvW and it settled down. My daughter is excellent in PVP and she doesn't step foot in WvW because of this sort of shit.
---
I will do what I want. I won't get out of WvW because you or anyone else wants me to. I also escort the doylaks's, etc. I have my fair share of solo kills. I research the builds. I have played on maps without a commander. Hell, today I took a tower with just myself and one other person. We killed three other players in the process. 
---
In short, don't be a dick if you don't know what the story is.
---
Each day we get closer to god.
---
an AFK farm disguised as content doesn't sound appealing to me
---
Agree but what if we just get events/dungeons instead? No physical changes to maps would be necessary.
---
Also, story is instanced anyway. Good example would be attack on white mantle in Brisban during LS3, sadly there was nothing to do on map during it.
---
Who said there will be physical change of landscape? Add dungeons and story is instanced anyway. Add few more events or even some non intrusive metas. 
---
Or it was only possible because of the territory speedboost and litereally gives no advantage if you're on the other side.
---
How do they negativly impact your gameplay? Season 4 brought us Harrier and Diviner which are meta for Druid, Firebrand, Tempest and Renegade, Chrono respectivly.
---
It's not, it is only doable with the territory speed buff.
---
man that spot is a thorn in the butt. Just remove the platform there when they jump from Anet xD
---
No Updraft was always a thing. Not only because of the added sub classes. You can find videos on it that go only a couple weeks after Wing 1 went live. Tempests did 36k on big hitboxes back than. 
---
Wing 1 being handled as a introductory wing is pretty strange. All you learn from the first two bosses is that you can outheal anything that comes at you.
---
Im not stalking you at all . You and your negative thought are everywhere first. Your name is stucked in my mind from Sandsweep Isles. 
---
Or making those stractures bigger ? Having them 6 years the same, would be nice to give them some love as well =/ 
---
pro tip incase you are ever gonna play WvW. make some reserch for what server you want to be on or which server has the balance of zerg/roaming that you are looking for.
---
Thats what I came to ask as well. Do you think you could add some kind of option/toggle to better sort those? I'm only interested in lvl 80 and expansion dailies and taking your example of going left to right doesn't apply today. Ascalon Forager, Swashbuckler's Cove and Dredgehaunt Cliffs Events are correct but Maguuma Wastes Vista doesn't show up for me ingame. There is however daily from expansion map. Just having expansion dailies show up first would solve this imo.
---
Also, having the ability to move general categories around would be sweet e.g. moving fractals or wvw to the top for a quick glance.
---
Other than those small issues I like your project a lot and I'll be using it daily.
---
Nailed it.
---
The last jump is possible without the speed boost as was shown in [this video](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axvq3m/you_dont_need_to_destroy_the_gates_if_you_can/) just yesterday.  
---
Speed boosts should not affect the leap distance anyways.
---
VG and Gorse where quite hard for pug groups until it slowly sunk down to those groups that just standing still and outhealing everything is way easier than playing the game.
---
Eternity
---
Actually, FD's The Guild is based on WoW. I played with her on the Fizzcrank server back when The Guild season 1 was coming out. Sponsored heavily by Microsoft, which was ... interesting.
---
I'm strongly irritated by your constant "you know nothing of me, but I will use my personality as an argument".
---
I assume if WvW players complained for a long time about guardian being able to jump into a keep, QA would have noted to check the same spot when adding a mount with jump ability. Just my assumption, I know much about QA, but I can't claim I know all since I never worked specifically in game QA, I assume you did (quoting you: ***"I know all about QA"***).
---
From what I heard recently many players playing GW2 did not mean that GW2 was main focus of ArenaNet and they were adding fully polished content. Thus I can't really assume that more players means more focus. After all PvP is hardly rewarding mode with much lesser player-base than PvE and yet it gets updates quite often. 
---
Fury of the Brand. Also Aurene can stay away, unless it's for a one time dramatic death-branded bossfight that doesn't repeat ever in the future and after which Aurene stays permanently dead.
---
I like this idea from a player perspective.  From a business view, the content needs to be geared to selling product, and right now that is PoF.  Retooling core Tyria maps would not sell any product.  
---
I hope that the next LW season follows the Silverwastes blue print, where one map gets progressively bigger (along with the meta event) with each chapter.  They obviously should do this on a much larger scale than SW, given how the game has evolved **&lt;make the map huge by the end of the story&gt;**.  This way everyone will be on the same map and we will not have maps like Kourna that get forgotten.  
---
so much effort for a joke xD
---
&gt;**Looks like being pissed off because people dont wanna learn and wanna get carried, its being toxic.**
---
Being toxic isn't about your feelings but about your behaviour.
---
[This video](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axvq3m/you_dont_need_to_destroy_the_gates_if_you_can/) begs to differ.
---
Hearts I dont mind at all. Games are here to be played and not rushed. I understand that some doesnt have time for it all but you can always do them later . You are not limited by time at all. I would love to see maps in areas we never been before. Even underwater ones even tho they are less likely. A new enemy we never seen before . We were fighting against elder dragons , white mantle and gods . All of them we knew before from diferent sources. We never had a fight where we had no clue what to do. Some secret weapon in really old scripts. We have answer on everything, even Kralk we had an answer but it went wrong. I would love to see one enemy for who we wouldnt had an answer to.
---
Mesmer GS is really useful in open world, it's only frowned upon in Fractals/Raids because the AA does more damage at max range (where you aren't getting buffs). In regular play, it's a great farming weapon, or just a solid ranged option as you close the distance to melee range. 
---
what kind of build is that?
---
[u/that_shaman](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axnqnf/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_march_5/) beat you to the post.  He has posted the data mined new and future items for quite some time now. 
---
I haven't gotten a chance to use them myself but I've been hearing good things about the new gyros, specifically in WvW. The changes are great for heal scrapper and sneak gyro is really good now. The changes didn't get scrapper close to holo at all though in terms of DPS so for organised content (fractals/raids) you'll still want that for DPS. If you already had a heal scrapper for raids or WvW though this is a nice buff to it but otherwise. Open world really doesn't matter at all and shouldn't need the gyros, you're better off with holo but again it doesn't matter so do what you like there. As for WvW I would go with a modified version of [Vabbi's build](http://builds.vabbi.org/) replacing supply crate with sneak gyro and possibly changing blast gyro (It was just there for superspeed). Metabattle also has [their variant](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scrapper_-_Med_Kit_Scrapper) (different scrapper traits) where they include other options.
---
They do? Unless you use the utilities, but you wouldn’t in place of the gyros. 
---
The first one is possible, but not like he did it. It's not reliable and rather difficult. The second I can reliably (almost 100%) do a little differently for sure.
---
Yesterday I did the second jump in a similar manner and ported 15 people inside.

Too bad /r/GW2GoneWild was banned, it'd fit perfectly.
---
Ah yeh good point.
---
I honestly don’t think this can be classed as an exploit, it’s just too obvious of a thing.
---
Wow, I wasn't expecting a reply after so long haha. That was a really nice read, and you seem to know a huge lot about the game. You should post this somewhere xD
---
Anyway, here's what I think. In my previous comment, I separated the "story" in 3 bits. Plot per say, dialogue and lore. These definitions probably don't have the same meaning for everyone, but what I mean is this: well, dialogue is self explanatory. The difference between lore and plotis , imo, that plot refers to the main events that we follow in the single player story mode. Lore are the details, the nuances. Little dialogue pieces you get here and there, backstories, connections between different characters, that kind of thing. The little things that define the world indirectly. Let's take Kralk for example. You say a lot of interesting things about him. But for the average player, like myself, the plot makes me infer only 2 different things about him: 1) he's purple, 2) he's really big. And it's not like I can only infer that cause the more important details are subtext - that'd be fine. The problem is that it's just not there at all. Surely he probably has some depth if you read the novels, or listen to all dialogue in the game. But if you just follow the plot - nope, not at all. He's purple and big. The little that we got from Glint's past and everything was kinda interesting, but absolutely shallow. It's almost as if they were just referencing plot points that we know nothing about, and didn't really explore those. So as someone that hasn't played GW1 or read the novels, it felt like "hey, there's something interesting here, maybe. But I'm not gonna develop it, go read the wiki". 
---
The reasons why I put the plot as being so bad could be explained scene by scene. Unecessary and forced deaths, and HUGE pacing issues with those. Claw Island is the perfect example, the secondary character that dies just didn't need to die at all. I cared nothing about them after the 5 mins worth of dialogue we had together, going through a dramatization that didn't feel convincing and just left me wondering "why do you have to stay and die again? like, really, one random extra soldier won't help, just jump on the ship already". Eir was also completely uncalled for and tried to work as a cheap drama tool. The Zaithan fight was a catastrophe in every way. Braham pulling the Sasuke on us was just nonsensical, tho I don't know how that concludes after PoF. The way they try to fit 20 minutes of mindless combat for every paragraph of script kills the pacing completely. Anyway, the list goes on. And those are the bad things about the plot, the fact that it lacks any goods is another problem by itself. But then again, I'm talking about plot here. Most of the interesting things you mention fall under my definition of lore, which I think it's ok. And saying it's ok is quite something, cause I'm quite a bitch when judging things. And a part of lore that isn't in our face or easily accessible. I don't think having "hidden" trivia a bad thing by itself, but if the bulk of what it's sold, the main plotline, is terrible, I will never be interested in the details of that terrible thing, even if it happens to fix it.
---
Anyway, not trying to shit on the game or anything, those are just my thoughts haha. You definitely made me interested in the novels, if I ever come back to GW2 I'll try to pick em up. Cheers!
---
There is like zero fish food in game, so there is deliberately left space for it since release. If it will arrive though, that is the question with no answers. 
---
If they will want to add it, they would probably want to make it unique and good, which is not easy task. So it depends if they will have good ideas and time to do such.
---
&gt; What are your thoughts on this? It opens up doors to collections,achievements and even maybe a legendary fishing pole because why not?
---
game doesnt need more afk farms.
---
that first leap is also doable with charrzooka + superspeed ;)
---
The other way around. Many wvwers hate the pve community due to long term constant toxicity and entitlement towards them. At some point you give up and treat them the same way. 
---
At this point toxicity is the only way to make many players understand I'm not leading for them but for other players. And truthfully I'm not leading for them because they're insanely obnoxious to put up with.
---
This is similar in raids, fractals, pvp,... the attitude that works in open world simplyndoesnt work in parts of the game where performance matters. So many players with certain attitudes aren't right for groups that want to perform. That simple.
---
As to when we will get them? No idea - but judging from the time already passed, and the presumption we will be getting Episode 6 in a month, give or take (I'm far more tolerant of delays given recent events, it happens when it happens) I suspect one of the stories will happen Soon(TM), and the final one will be posted along with the trailer.
---
As to what we will learn? Well, this is just a hunch, but I feel like each of these characters will be integral to where we go from here - their experiences put together will help us form a plan of action. So, starting with Rytlock, what did we learn?
---
- Sohothin was found by the Flame Legion in the Ring of Fire.
---
- Rytlock stole it and it fucked up his life.
---
- Logan's probably going to have to keep it.
---
What do we know about Zafirah?
---
- Possible smuggler, turned Priestess of Balthazar.
---
- Saw Balthazar differently; misses him terribly.
---
- Still able to get in contact with the Zaishen at short notice, so they're still a thing.
---
And Caithe?
---
- Sneaky
---
- Shitty ex
---
- Double Dragon minion - Aurene has a connection with her. Or, had.
---
Oddly enough, these three characters only share one thing in common - they are all linked by Balthazar's magic. Rytlock has Sohothin, Zafirah is Zaishen, Caithe has been Branded by Aurene, who ate a bit of Balthazar (confirmed relevant by Zafirah feeling Balth's presence when she met Aurene.) Despite h
---
Being dead and devoured, he still links the three of them -- and just from that, I suspect that whatever conclusion the three of them come to, it will be related to him. So, what do we know about Balthazar, and what DON'T we know?
---
- Was chained in the Mists and had his magic stolen (who replaced him?)
---
- Pissed at the Gods (except Lyssa, for some reason?)
---
- Escaped Mists, went to Orr to get something, went to the Ring of Fire to try and eat Primordus, then to the Desert for Kralk. (What did he need from Orr?)
---
- Created the Forged, who invaded Tyria via the Realm of Torment (Why not the Fissure of Woe, is that not his realm anymore? Or, were they just using the Shadow Nexus -- basically God magitech that allowed the Five to portal in and make sure Abaddon's chains were still on tight, later co-opted by him to make Torment Rifts all over Tyria.)
---
The mysteries around Balthazar all point to one place - his natural habitat, The Mists. Where Kralk is, where Glint is, and where Aurene, I'd assume, would be. (Vlast is there also I guess.) Aurene was our last hope, so either we pull a new bold plan out of our ass, or we go get her back. 
---
I've gone back and forth on where I think the next map will be, I was thinking it'd be the mountain south of the Desolation where Kralk was parked in Episode 1 - this is still a live possibility. However, I'm utterly certain that we will be going to the Mists -- and while there are portals to the Mists all over Tyria, the majority of them seem to be to The Underworld. That's where Kralk is, eating souls. We probably don't want to go there yet.
---
However, there is one particularly enticing Mist Portal, that does not go through The Underworld. Abaddon's Mouth, in the Fire Islands. Where Prince Rurik was put to rest, and where the Flame Legion uncovered Sohothin. Next to Draconis Mons, where Balthazar tried to eat Primordus. Where the Lich was killed on the Bloodstone, finally bringing Glint's Flameseeker Prophecies to an end. (Allegedly.)
---
This is a direct route to the Realm of Torment, where the Forged staged their invasion. Balthazar seemed to be building his forces while he was in Draconis Mons, pulling the souls out of his White Mantle recruits and putting them in constructs. I do think that Season 4 will not end with a neat conclusion, as we are heading straight into Season 5 after that - we might see the Blood Legion Homelands, the Remains of Sahlajah (south of Desolation) and other Kralk-related locations there, but none of them fit quite right into the story as it is now.
---
In my opinion, we are going to **Komalie Caldera** -- Rytlock will deal with, I'd assume, the Flame Legion presence there, Zafirah will get us through the Door into the Foundry, and when we are in the Mists, Caithe will be able to sense Aurene again. And then we figure it out from there.
---
Now, if you could actually get edible *meat* from a tuna or other sea critter (Bang Bang Thundershrimp FTW!!!), then I could see it being a potential cooking ingredient. But nah, we get scales and fins. Who wants to eat fish scales and fins? Nobody is who.
---
I am going for a specific current stat right now so yeah.
---
As a necromancer on a warclaw I love being immune to roamers just like all the high movement speed professions.
---
I love being able to scout keeps and disable enemy siege 50% quicker and have my defensive zerg arrive 50% faster.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'm not sure any of that is healthy for the game mode long term though. 
---
Also in a week when every regular WvW player has their mount it'll be hell for new players to join the game mode because they won't be able to keep up unless there are commanders that decide to move around on foot 100% of the time.
---
I can see your point, however especially in the case of LA, they've scrapped one of the most unique places on the world map. If they decided to modify a "generic" (either not unique or not unique on a given map) part of the map, nobody would complain. 
---
Plants in episode 6?!?
---
This. Changes. EVERYTHING!
---
Presumably you could kill all 1000 inquest in a single day if you want to. So why can't players complete 16 hearts in a single day if they want to (by making hearts be repeatable immediately)? That's the issue with timegating. 
---
Confirmed, am now full of instruments.
---
It's fine, we were not given any "epic" story in the living world for so long that I can assure you there's no living world budget assigned to that.
---
It always was an AoE after detonation, you had to press 2 twice though.
---
Which leads me to believe you didn't even know it had two active parts.
---
Yee, scrolled down looking for this.
---
No, I run at 60 fps, it isn't completely stable but it is the mean.   
---
It is also not entirely CPU bound and a gpu matters. Yes, anets thread performance is garbage and it will bottleneck but a good gpu is important as well. It's why my 780 is good enough since the cpu is bottlenecking harder.
---
Skill are straight forward, with the mount you can turn your camera to change direction midair
---
I don't believe that you have 60fps average at North THP.
---
Zinn. If he has another failed city lying around I'm going to be so mad.
---
I'd rather they went the Dry Top route, of releasing maps over several episodes where each one unlocks a little bit more. It would mean they don't invalidate old content without flooding the game with limited lifespan maps.
---
Okay... I don't care if you believe me or not. What matters is that something funky is going on with your gpu since it's underperforming. You might want to look into potential driver issues
---
They added a fishing event in Sandswept Isles, that was more than enough for me. Check it out if you haven’t already. 
---
Bruh 15k hours... that’s a bit excessive 
---
What the fuck
---
Its possible in enemy held hills keep. My zerg did this last night and ported everyone in with a mesmer. 
---
Nice! I wanted to get into the music scene for a long time, but I've waited for exactly this to come around. Thanks Mr anet. 
---
you have a fundamental and fatal misunderstanding about the "wvw population", which invalidates every argument you base off of it. (blacksheeps and vocal minorities that exist on all sides aside) wvwers are pretty happy about content and attention the mode gets. what frustrates them, is that every 2 years or so anet drops a major bombshell that generally adds to the mode, but in many cases also draws attention to very old issues, bugs, and exploits. however they barely ever iterate on the mode that lies beneath to actually fix said issues, and make it overall more attractive to outsiders.
---
yes, the WC is great for newer players that aren't good at navigating the mode, but it also once again drew attention to problems that should have been fixed years ago, and adds an entire other pile of issues on top (e.g. dismount jumping).
---
with that being said i personally hope everyone enjoys their time in wvw rn. these rare types of changes, and the periods of adjustment they bring can arguably be some of the most fun times you'll ever have in wvw, despite the issues.
---
Huh? What does that matter? She's dead, she should stay dead.
---
What version of GW2 have you been playing its only ever had dailies and monthlies till monthlies were removed.
---
This guy plays exclusively condi firebrand… and suddenly everything makes sense.
---
How do you reset the .dat file?
---
and others get arrested but let's not dwell on that
---
Thanks.  I already have it like that for almost everywhere I can keep it.  Those options.
---
I've thought too it is because of so many people.  If they simply created more instances by halving the population, it would be so great.  But since it did not happen when Ben was here, the odds of that happening these days is pretty unlikely.
---
That's why I am very much in the market for a new pass if it can compete with Mistlock in terms of speed in both usage and loading.  Armistice Bastion Pass has buttons to take you immediately to any area which I love.  So it can equal I would think or surpass Mistlock.
---
But the loading time is what I do not know.  I have the options you suggested but the thing is Mistlock still takes longer than DR and other passes I have.  But I don't have Armistice Bastion Pass and want to know how it's loading time compares to Mistlock and DR.
---
You do have a point though about the popularity.  Maybe it's too soon to ask this question.  I should give it a week or two maybe for more to purchase Armistice Bastion Pass.  Let it get as crowded as it might get to compare it with Mistlock.  Otherwise, Mistlock may be higher and later Armistice Bastion Pass might be.  Though....from what you said about Mistlock being small......a good point.  
---
Armistice Bastion Pass is big so perhaps it will be objectively faster.
---
Hmm.  
---
They really need to remove the leap and replace it by a short speed burst instead. Like while you have the space bar pressed you go 2x faster until your endurance is depleted. It's going to take forever to seal up all the known jump spots and who knows how many unknown spots there will be. It was a mistake to give them a leap.
---
please, those you can easier than a stealth thief.
---
I mean, we put Dhuum into box specifically because he like this idea. Dead should stay dead.
---
i wonder if other sieges have a similar dismount function
---
while there may be some difference, the real answer is: in the longterm, neither.
---
loading times are highly dependent on the amount of players the game has to load (because of all their gear varieties and infusions etc). so, if both maps have an equal amount of players around when you load in, their loading times will be very close. if one has the players more spread out, it will be faster. mistlock tends to have all players in sight, so everyone is loaded, if the armistice is different, then it will probably be faster, unless it has a higher player cap. right now there will be way fewer users for the new pass so it's practically guaranteed it'll be faster, but once more people use it, it may turn around again.
---
I'm sure someone can test it and tell you that armistice is faster right now because they only have to load a few players, but your question was wrong in the first place because it's answer can change over time. so in my opinion, the question should be: whats the player cap each and how far apart are the most commonly used areas in the new pass - because by that you can make an informed decision which one will be faster both now and in the future.
---
"It's... Balthazar. He is inside me. I've never felt this close to him before. It's like we merged into -"
---
"Zaf, please. We don't want to hear it."
---
because scrapper's purpose has always been more of a PvP role then anything usefull in pve
---
Dear person on the internet. I use what ever words i prefer, AnD i Write dom med vilka words i känner för. Ha eN gOOd Day.
---
did i even say that the problem should exist ? 
---
grow up kid
---
Make your own lfg?
---
tbf most of Heal Engi's kit is just in Core Engi. Scrapper usually just ends up being the 'least worst' line on most cases.
---
Aww you had a problem with people on the Internet? Want to talk about it?
---
Backcap?
---
Because anet does not care. It's just that simple. 
---
Uhm... the PvP equivalent is league tickets, and those are limited too.
---
It is start of the story after PoF and before epizode 2. So if you want to have it complete, just buy it. Also, it is quite nice map, it has good meta events and a lot to earn. Worth the 70 gold or those gems.
---
It’s a monument to 1/3 the WvW dev team. 
---
Learn manners. I didn’t insult you, but I guess that’s why my reddit historial shows I downvoted you 7 times in the past.  
---
  
---
If its 5 minutes its still 11 hours and 8.5 hours.
---
I do my monday fullrun on Magi/Plaguedoctor/Viper scourge. I don't need to tag up when I want to join a Xera or Gorseval only group.
---
Yup.
---
Many say that GW2 revolutionizes and innovates MMORPG genre. Well, yeah - they maybe do. However any smaller studio can just sit down and make "GW2 clone" styled game and it will win over GW2 for as long as they continually expand on what ANet only started. I could see a strong demographic for a game that has only WvW-styled game mode, as long as this game would be more polished. 
---
Dope *-*
---
Welcome to PoF :D, it's not very clear what's going on. It was much more intuitive back in those days.
---
With maximized participation (say, full T6 and you just cap a camp, tower, or keep which gives 10 minutes before participation loss) you can go afk for \~20 minutes (4 ticks) before no longer getting pips.
---
If you've tagged most camps/towers/keeps before going afk (by killing \~3 guards) then you'll still get credit while afking if they get captured, which would reset that 10 minutes before losing participation. You'll even get credit if they get captured by the other team THEN yours.
---
That said, this is overall a bad thing to do now that participation doesn't degrade while outside WvW. Better to cap participation, and capture a camp then leave (or wait for a &lt;1 minute countedown) and start out next time with a full T6 participation.
---
"Number of Bounces: 5"
---
Will it only bounce towards targets who are mounted?
---
Wasnt it supposed to be some kind of Semi Tank, Semi support thing?
---
I (like everyone else) make misstakes.
---
Yeah Lake Doric Farm. Well Cantaurs do learn to defend themselfs you know . We do not have any inteligent fishes in the game wich wouldnt want to be fished up. Sorry Largos and Quaggans. I ment challanging with a minigame where you need to pay attention or something like that . Not challanging that you are runing away with your life in danger. 
---
It's sad that criticism is the same as crying to you. You are propably one of those who instantly leave the squad when they get told they could have done something in a different, better way.
---
You can check all skins in wardrobe tab in bank.
---
Might be a missed tool-tip, seems to be happening a lot. I'd assume that this would carry over through all siege ranks. Still, only way to know for sure is to test it out!
---
In that regard, yes.
---
Overall, no.
---
And therefore not a good idea.
---
This is a garbage attitude that toxicity is the only way to lead people through a challenge. Never, in any collaborative setting, has taking a steaming shit on people been the best way to motivate them. If you want to alienate people, fine, go right ahead and be a dick to them. Good luck getting future support for WvW when the population dwindles.
---
You need to learn how to play nice with others or you should expect to  play in an environment that makes you mad because you are directly contributing to the shitty attitude.
---
They didn't even promise us stuff or told us they would be implemented. Instead we got something we never asked for which seems to be breaking the gamemode instead of the stuff we wanted.  
---
If they promised stuff to us and gave us mounts, now that would be one hell of a middle finger towards the community
---
Probably not, cause it was originally meant for gliders.
---
You can check my history like before ;). Im to lazy to do it myself. Also I dont mind you been critical at all . Everyone is diferent and everyone feels diferently. Just dont want to spred "false" informations based on my expectations thats all. The best example would be the WarClaw now. Everyone was expecting something. I even heard that you will need 1 000 rank to get it and look at it now. Just because one player came up with that information, said it to next one.. and next one. At the end we had reddit panic for no reason. People really need to know how to handle information =/ 
---
More of a tank/bruiser, which is practically useless in pve, but since implementation was bad it wasnt very good in other modes as well. It's the med kit rework which revived it as support, not scrapper on its own.
---
WoW releases a mount in their store every few weeks. Yet we get hundreds of new skins every month that could be rewards in the game. And miss me with that bullshit grind for gold to gems shit.
---
You could use the wardrobe tab at any bank or browse the gallery of greatswords in the wiki.
---
While there aren't (to my knowledge) any other GS with such obnoxious red flames, here are some alternatives: Fused Greatsword (half the price of Volcanus, so still kinda steep for less flames), Mad Realm Greatsword (black flames), Cobalt (very cheap blue flames when wielded), War God's Greatsword (not as fiery, more steel in it); and if you'd like a lava-like greatsword and not necessarily flames: Molten Greatsword, Primordus Greatsword.
---
But there are another way. EotM counts too. Even the rewardtrack can be done there. You can run around playing what ever you like without anyone ever saying a thing to you. The only thing you can not do in EotM are the camps, but i mean, like 5 min in wvw to take a camp is possible for anyone to manage :)
---
Pretty much this. Scrapper is nice for the double rez, really good elite (in situations that actually make use of it), and the inherent survivability of Scrapper is good as well, but otherwise it's basically just Core Engi with some Scrapper underwear on.
---
Until there comes a time where an Engi elite spec is made that is more group support oriented than Scrapper comes about, Scrapper is just a shoe-in for the last trait. 
---
Cobolt, Molten, Primordus
---
ummm 
---
It's not a Raiding PvE so I don't think so. After all, some of those jumps can be done without a mount... 
---
That was the only point of eotm, to do something while there are queues.
---
I got a evil land shark vision eating people in my head now. 
---
I hope they didn't...so people with your mentality could actually see the difference.
---
Skyforge is the best example I have from personal experience. This game had weekly progression caps, in a game that had  large vertical growth. The intended purpose (stated by the developers) was to keep players in roughly the same progression tier, but the result was the opposite. People who capped weekly quickly got ahead of more casual players. The result was a fractured community when higher grade content started dropping and there was no point in guilds taking on new blood since you couldn't power level someone to bring them up to snuff. The game is still online, but its pretty much a zombie game at this point.
---
Maplestory 2's a more recent example, while that game has plenty of other reasons it crashed, a big one was time gates involving valuable progression materials. It had a similar impact as it did on Skyforge.
---
Then you have games with timegates initially in release have since removed them because people hit them and just log off. These are the kind of games let you only play for X amount of time before penalizing you. Dragon Nest, DFO, Vindicus are examples of these.
---
But then it would be less Plague and more doctor. 
---
Dr. Plague?
---
&gt; Because anet does not care.
---
Said unironically after a patch that has brought various changes to Scrapper.
---
I am curious, why do you want to know that?
---
Because ArenaNet is forcing them to.  You cannot blame the PvE players when the only way to get the new mount is by going into WvW.  The majority of that population doesn't want to do WvW in the first place.  
---
The WvW community would do the same thing if ArenaNet suddenly released something that everyone in WvW wants/needs but they put it in raids.  That population wouldn't give a damn what the mechanics are or how they work.  They wouldn't be interested in learning it all.  They would just want to spend their required hours in the mode, get their reward, and gtfo.  
---
I get they are making WvW worse for the hardcore folks right now.  You'll get over it.  They are going to leave soon.
---
That's a great idea! It'd generally be better on terrain too for charging or chasing. Hire this guy's idea anet.
---
I've started working on a settings screen, that's definitely going on there. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release/Features
---
Maybe that helps a bit. Dont think there is anything more detailed out there.
---
Kitties are unable to catch other kitties.  The best you can do is keep up with them or be around them (if you're on home-turf).  Mesmer trolls in Hills/Bay are going to have a load of fun with this mount, lemme tell ya.
---
Or more specifically their balance team doesn’t care. Some of their decisions are honestly completely baffling. Remember the first Deadeye rework and how completely useless it was? Well it didn’t take weeks of testing to realize that. High level players could tell it was complete garbage within an hour of the patch, hell you could probably gather that from just the patch notes and looking at how the damage numbers got LOWER.
---
It honestly feels like nobody in the balance team actually plays this game at a high level, and that’s incredibly disturbing if true. 
---
Mostly for organization purposes, I would like to be able to for example unlock all core game skins. Then I'll work on living story episode x skins. Then focus on unlocking all heart of thorns skins. I'm very collector oriented it's just an organization tool personally.
---
Do I need to be PvP level 100 to craft the Legendary Armor? 
---
Interesting stuff, thanks.
---
You will only get the participation that you would get yourself for your rank, the war score of your world, if you completed the wood chest last week and maybe even the Commander if you got enough players in your squad. So no outnumber bonus.
---
I don't know about participation. If other Worlds are counted as enemies and you kill them then you could keep your participation up but not as like "I will go to the camp to prevent the decay".
---
I don't need to do anything. You see I did put countless hours into playing nice and organising pug raids, helping provide resources and so forth and what you learn is that many players have no interest in learning. Or with playing with people. Or improving. They're there to take advantage of whatever services you provide as they see fit. They're plain entitled. 
---
So frankly I'll do the exact same as them. I'll play how I see fit for me personally. Lead elitist or don't lead at all. I don't need you and I don't really want to fight you either.
---
I'm also past the point where I think wvw will improve for players like me. Gw2 is being milked for money. How many years do you want us to put up with your bullshit under the guise of itll make wvw great while also demanding that the updates wvw get once every year are catered around getting wvw haters into the game mode? Not sure.
---
People like you motivate me to keep going. All this entitlement on how you deserve to be treated better yet across so many servers on EU and na despite the best intentions of the vast majority of players wvwers are annoyed and frustrated. Surely just because they're angry people with no merit at all. 
---
You going to do better then do it. I'll play wvw as I see fit and I see most of you as entitled leeches who add next to nothing. 
---
But the 6k ap lvl 60 guard that was annoyed i kicked him from squad on a map with q70 yday fully agreed with you.
---
My take is that when you put that squad tag on you also have to take on the responsibility of leading/instructing people who don't know what they are doing. Bullying them out of your squad is the opposite of leading. Compare this guy's attitude to what you might see on a Tequatl or Triple Trouble fight. There, multiple guilds spend time blasting instructions in chat for anyone who might be unfamiliar with the encounter. They do this every day multiple times a day. The result is that loads of new players do the boss fight, the maps are always full when it comes up, and they almost always succeed.
---
Why dont they just add traps and give warclaw skills that only affect other warclaws that allow you to dismount? 
---
Fair enough, I am frankly just abusing Rapid Regeneration bundled with the perma Super Speed to have the Core Engi traits go nuttier but thats it. Its still not -bad- as OP stated, it has its place.
---
Except spellbreaker is actually good in pve. 
---
What is farmable here? VM? Gear? Ecto? All of the above?
---
Have you considered posting about aspects of the game you're knowledgable about and refraining from posting related to aspects of the game you don't really play or pay attention to? =)
---
i hear LUCK slayer
---
I agree, I just think that for a quick fix this might work out. We know how long Anet can take with "fixing things". Ogrewatch took 2 months to get changed so you couldn't glide into when gliding first came to WvW. This is a much bigger problem IMO.
---
Yeah, but your team controlled the objective and it would have been a lot faster to just go through the gate passages. /s
---
Except as the OP noted, this is the ONLY spec that has NEVER been good in this mode. This is literally the only exception that makes your argument. There’s no reason for an elite spec to be bad in the most popular game mode when there’s multiple trait options in each spec. SOME options can be given to make it viable. 
---
Already did. I hope it gets addressed asap so I can enjoy Karma extraction there
---
I believe that part of the reason is the lack of a lobby scrapper (and engineer has) compared to some other classes. It's barely possible to say the word necro before all the whiners, haters and fanboys start trolling each other in chat. Engineers lacks the vocal and fan- (or hater-)base and thus the devs don't get into much trouble when ignoring it.
---
I don't say this is the main reason but it doesn't help. I'd say another reason is that, as you said, scrapper lacks vision and an idea of what it could do in PvE - despite the bad state reaper was in, at least it had some sort of identity.
---
Anet straight up doesnt sse ot as a problem though. And neither do it.
---
Performance on teq is irrelevant. Performance in wvw is something which funnily enough the worst players demand the most. When fights are lost it's not the hardcore wvwers afk in spawn. Its these same entitled people who aren't having fun. Then after 30 minutes they offer their expert opinion of please stop fighting and cap a tower. But they will still stay on map because there are no other commanders for them to leech from.
---
If you think everyone in pve is magically nice while everyone in pvp wvw and raids is magically mean then stay out of these modes lol. 
---
But, Scrapper hasn’t been viable in pve for several years. 
---
I hadn't heard about that streamer, but that doesn't surprise me in the least.
---
With anet's track record, it really does seem that the best way to get an exploit fixed is to make sure as many people know how to perform it as possible so it gets horribly abused.
---
Like, as you mentioned, Ogrewatch, lol.  Though, credit where it's due, at least they *tried* to fix that one several times before finally just moving the tower.  None of their fixes worked, even that one, but at least they tried.  Probably wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't so widely abused.
---
Hell, speaking of that tower, I wouldn't be shocked if the mount can get into it.  Haven't tried (thanks, eb queues), but it seems like there might be two ways in at least.
---
In a way. Though, Dartwo explains what I was refering to below, in their reply to you. :)
---
No your actions undercut your goals, and I wont get my perfect scenario no matter what I do. This has been made abundantly clear by both anet and the toxic pve community.
---
I am sorry but this is very hypocritical written and a bit hard to find a common point because your post is full of flaws, but i think you already know that. So i guess i do the agree to disagree,
---
Hmm .. good idea. Or Largos jumping out of the water and instakilling you. Or Quaggan stucked and crying on your fishing rood. =( 
---
Gotta hit em first
---
This a new meme we're gonna keep up since the doomsday gang was 100% wrong about how "terrible" the Warclaw would be for the mode?
---
This *one* thing is gonna be what we harp on now?
---
Itd be a good idea to give them a special skill for persuing players, and take a lot of the heat off of the unmounted players
---
[Nah](https://imgur.com/eG64pn5)
---
Facts my good sir
---
I literally got a "forum warning" by just saying that reddit had these videos lol
---
99% sure w5/6 minis could never be exchanged in the portable exchange
---
Yea but why do they always wait for it to be fully released for these OBVIOUS changes to be made.... Warclaw still in BETA or what?
---
Maybe because that one thing was an old issue that got introduced with new skills from elite specs or reworks, as well as gliding and none of them were fixed. Introducing more "exploits" is pretty much a meme at this point. 
---
...or the widespread "don't talk to me or my son ever again"?
---
Limited testers my guess.
---
And from my experience. You almost never guess what the players will do in your game, or the kind of shit they find out is a problem.
---
If you already know that perfection is unattainable then you are only hurting yourself by getting mad when you continue to fail to attain it. I'm trying to convey the idea that attitude and perception will ultimately shape whether or not you're enjoying yourself and you have complete control over your own attitude. Bad attitude = bad time, simple as that. You are the maker of your own bad time.
---
Excellent points.
---
I'm not sure if anyone knows the player cap for Mistlock even.  I suppose one could try to go around and count every player and see if that number stays constant over an hour or two period during peak times to see.
---
Perhaps I'll wait a couple of weeks and post again in the format you suggested.  Thank you.
---
Very cute.
---
Does every single spec has to be used in meta end-game?
---
The borderlands have been over run by field mice and my warclaw just can't seem to keep his belly full.
---
One of the biggest mistakes in the games history 
---
Just give it alacrity and quickness. Suddenly we might also have an option to Chronomancer then for both of those boons in the one profession.
---
Two problems solved, everyone is happy.
---
I know this might come out weird but what if.. it wasn't designed to be good for PvE?
---
Shocking!! 
---
I'll present this question instead. Why do all specs have to be good everywhere? Answer is they dont! They never had to and never will
---
Just like Renegade for example is shit in PvP and "amaizing" in PvE
---
Because, you old fart, I get my giggitty watching you go bonkers.
---
At the time HoT launched, core engineer was fantastic in PvE but terrible in PvP. The purpose of scrapper was to give engineer a viable option in PvP.
---
I also wonder if the immobilize applies once it knocks a person off, would be cool if it did actually.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker is the same way.
---
Spellbreaker did competitive DPS for warrior for quite a while, not sure where it lands now with banner nerfs but what I am trying to say is spellbreaker is a terrible example in this case.
---
&gt;I suggest that it's healthy and good if not every specialization is good in every mode. Well-designed elite specializations will help a class fill a unique niche with its mechanics.
---
For this to be the case scrapper should have a well defined niche and it doesn't. In fact, Holosmith displaced scrapper in almost every way other than condi conversion in WvW, hardly to be considered a worthy niche with firebrand being much more prominent  though.
---
Since it's done with an effect, what it does can be tweaked.   
---
The effect could prevent extra bleeding from more mauling.  
---
Or it could be a stacking resistance. Every time you get pounced, you the effect you get makes you take 10% less damage from a pounce. After 10 stacks, you take -100% damage, and pounces do nothing to you. 
---
They reeeally shoould remove the leap and replace it with a speed boost. Plz anet, begging ya.
---
Were mount packs ever at 2k original price? I seem to remember them being discounted all the time, even returning ones...
---
You can, actually. It's just a more precise jump sport to where the cannon is on outer
---
so scrapper is good in what gamemode again?, outside the condi conversion WvW build that competes with the much more popular and prominent firebrand of course.
---
Please show me how scrapper builds are being used effectively in any gamemode.
---
I like how all the other gyros blush too in the last panel.
---
Interesting, but yeah that needs to come soon before people figure out more ways to exploit.
---
If fishing in GW2 was done like in other mmos, as an afk activity, we would not be playing GW2.
---
Many staple elements like mounts also suck in most other mmos. But GW2 did them different.
---
If Fishing isn't done the GW2 way, it'd be better not getting it added at all. But if it's done right, it could be as memorable as [other famous fishing minigame](https://youtu.be/5BW9BEKVtX8)s.
---
They're wrong and arbitrary.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

Ah crap... That reminds me that I need to camp that map after the next hotfix/world instance reset to finish my last achievement still.
---
Did they by any chance fix the event with rounding up the marmoxes or w/e if the scarabs overrun the farm? Queen Beetle is all I have left
---
&gt;Scrapper MAYBE viable for PvE.
---
Gyros are much better now minus some bugs but they aren't anything desirable in PvE outside memes.
---
That is actually not a bad thing in my eyes.
---
If you are attempting to travel to where a fight is you have some protection from being stealth ganked (albiet its definitively too much currently) while if you are attempting combat or something you are vulnerable to a swift death if your build does not have contingencies for it.
---
Hey sorry didn't mean to stealth edit on you if you want to address anything else I added.
---
To that point, I haven't played WoW. Not for a long enough duration to come across mounts, anyway. So I really can't speak to their system. I think the mount's health in GW2 could be toned down, but I'd prefer the enemy have to put a bit of work in to dismount instead of a couple potshots being enough. The "gank-from-stealth" would still be an issue if they could fire a couple autos before setting into their rotation, and at that point the dismounted player would be "stunned" for a second, making it possibly worse than before.
---
They seem to be actively listening to feedback though, and we saw balance patches for it yesterday. I think in time they can achieve a happy medium for players.
---
I can appreciate how strong of an oatmeal advocate you are. :)
---
I mean look at elem in any game mode except PvE, they're below trash
---
Scrapper is awesome on river. It makes low man river runs faster and easier. 
---
I would say a better solution would be cc dismounts you and the player takes percentage max health equal to half the percentage max health lost by your mount.
---
In other words if your mount is fully killed you will be at half health.
---
This just made me remember that I wish that mounts scaled to race as well, not just height. Norn and Charr can look pretty silly on some of the mounts :(
---
I honestly think it could be great if they buffed pretty much everything related to the elite spec a bit, and reworked function gyro to do something ON TOP of the ranged finisher/revive. Or hell, at least make the revive or finisher almost instant. There will of course be a lot of shock factor with an extreme change like that, but once it settles in I don't think anyone will be crying wolf.
---
Nah all ingredients in gw2 are not fishes or seafood because they are saving it for fishing in case they wanna implement it.
---
Armistice is also all about conveniece with the teleporting with acces to WvW as it's main unique gimmick compared to the other pass areas.
---
Pretty sure it's meta for giving superspeed to desmina during soul river (lol).
---
you could argue that having to struggle with that is kind of the point, you shouldn't be given "free" passage to the area you want to go, delays in reinforcement is a resource struggle that has to be dealt with. 
---
?
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hindsight 20/20 brother.
---
I don't WvW much. But when I do, I do like roaming and scouting as I'm a thief main. But the biggest gripe I have with mounts, is just about anyone can do my damn job now.
---
queue south park "THEY TOOK MY JOB!"
---
How would you handle the evade frames granted by the jump? Just remove them flat out?
---
No offense to ArenaNet, but it’s complete and utter dogshit. You don’t introduce something like this in a (lol) competitive game mode.
---
Let me explain this further. Monday. My group of 30 is beginning to engage with another zerg. Empower, stability and push to engage. We then regroup to heal, drop reflects reapply stability and push remaining zerg. Tactical. Efficient. Organized.
---
Now yesterday. Notice enemy Zerg that easily has 20 on us. Prebuff stab. Double veil. Mount charge in with 3 dishes and hit 1. 80% of enemy zerg deleted. Not down, not dead. Literally fucking deleted. Their games uninstalled. Massive spread to clean up remaining players.
---
It’s a fucking joke and there is no one who can seriously look at the mount as an improvement to WvW. 
---
So instead of real improvements to WvW (alliance system, fix the Shitty Meta), we get these halfassed updates which are loaded with bugs and haven’t been tested. Yet people still eat it up...
---
Mount for travel, sure. Mounts for siege, sure, granted the siege capability of this mount is a joke. But mounts for battle? Bad. Fucking. Move.
---
Well... They can take gari without needing to break down any gate if a mesmer with a portal abuses it... So no swords untill they fight the lord making it really hard to defend gari...  
---
I dunno... Seems a bit game breaking?
---
If this is a serious question: You can adjust your buffs (and golem debuffs) in this area.
---
Given how good the entire game is otherwise, it's not surprising. Like complaining about a chunk of brick in a good stew, the brick is all that's remembered.
---

[Second One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ay1hkl/i_was_not_expecting_this_to_be_succeeded_tbh_it/)
---
BTW let me clarify something about these exploits.
---
The Gandara community, including me, neither abuse these exploits nor suggest them in any situation or in any map. Mount is super fun and i hope these ones will be fixed asap.
---
Equip full zerk. Use herald. And there is a utility skill that gives you quite literally. [+15% DAMAGE FOR A DURATION]. I can crit 22k with Sword 3 within 2 seconds of my own buffs alone. 
---
I'm not doing anything wrong. That's a feature they add. If it's not working as intended and they think it's game-changing, they would simply disable the mount till they are done these and it's ready to be released. They should have tested or at least made players test their new content anyways (like they did back in POF release). Nobody is abusing the system at least in my server and the other two opponent servers, even tho it's not easy to abuse the system while servers and matches are very busy. They didn't announce anything about the situation publicly and even the posts are allowed in reddit.
---
And you get quickness ... and you... and you... 
---
I recommend you download arcdps, log your attempts at "burst" and at some point realize that you are fooling yourself with those quick maffs.
---
If your engage is evaded, you can remount and try again.
---
Use that big brain. The less you use it, the more it will rot.
---
They nerfed the engage skill very hard yesterday (10 targets down to 3 and major damage nerf), so it should align better with the travelers speed and protection (still definitely too much protection) now.
---
Can't read it atm but upvoted for visibility. No idea why some people are against discussion
---
So what you're saying is that disengaging from fights is now based on player skill and ability rather than being flat out-classed by classes that are literally impossible to disengage with? Survival when you see an enemy that outclasses you now relies on something other than how fast you can open the map to a waypoint that isn't contested?
---
The HORROR.
---
I ended up unlocking all LW maps S3:1 through S4:3 since I came back last spring (on a long break since right after Season 1), there are several benefits to each one aside from story - collections, achievements, farmable currency for ascended gears, etc. Way more than "two hours playable content" you hear people moaning about if you look for it.
---
DPS and Burst are different. It just sounds like youre confusing yourself with raid viability and Optimal. Its true to this day that raid "viability" is around 10k DPS. 
---
Exactly this.
---
...and even there they are mostly trash.
---
But it could. It coooould.
---
Literally can’t roam at all right now.  I think the mount and pop spike are both to blame.  We’ll see soon which one is effecting it more.  I’m going to put my money on warclaw...
---
The thing is it's not a brick. It's some people who whine about how there's not enough pepper, then complaining that there's too much pepper, then complaining that the carrots are too small. It's good stew and the likelihood that your suggestion will improve it is very small.
---
hahahahah, dont worry, im not like that all the time, in fact, as i said on the post, i have the patience to teach, but sometimes the patience ends whern you face some heardheads.
---
Just some thoughts from what I've messed with so far;
---
* The health of the Warclaw seems too tanky, especially since it's an evasive mount. Like I've hardly ever seen a person who wasn't afk on it or is sitting in the middle of an enemy zerg dismounted, but I've seen plenty of them just yolo triple leap through a zerg. Particularly speaking, I got hit in EB earlier today by a guild treb from Red Keep attacking SMC and still had like half to a quarter health left, as well as ran up Ogrewatch hill through and enemy zerg that was boming the choke and into the Ogres without dying (but I did get dismount from the condis). That I feel shouldn't happen.
---
* It feels like it's too easy to just remount and gtfo. Like in zerg fights I've just been messing around running in down stomping, running out of combat, getting back on, and repeating over and over in just a very short while. And this on my Necro, like if I was on my theif or something else that I could ooc a little bit better on then I could do that all faster.
---
* The movement speed and leaps feel nice for like catching up and getting around.
---
* The door tether just seems to be a useless waste of supply. 2k damage per 1 supply just seems pointless when you could do more work with a regular flame ram. Not to mention, you'd be at least be a little more defended with the ram's abilities and targeting than when you enter tether mode on the Warclaw.  
---
* The leap and momentum it has seems to be able to get into certain structures or areas people (who don't own it) really shouldn't be able to get into. Maybe if the skill was changed to like a ground based charge similar to like Warrior's GS charges or like Daredevil's evade trait unhindered combatant, then it might help mitigate some of the issues.
---
Also just keep in mind that things are still new and WvW still is seeing a big influx of people. So some appraisal is going to be hard to mess with the full good and bad until people get a little more used it and WvW activity setles more back into status-quo.
---
You are wide-spreading exploits willingly, knowing fully well what you are doing.
---
You're either new enough to GW2 to not know the past about exploit sharing, or you are actually ignorant about how these cases are handled.
---
If I were you, I'd send these to ANet instead of wide-spreading them as you have been. Else, continue on...and I hope you're praying to your favoured deity to avoid a long-term suspension.
---
i see. as i said i'm not doubting you. just found it strange cause i played more than 15 hours and didn't encounter and server problem. that's all. maybe 3 full mounted zergs could be the reason for that cause you said ebg. shall see what anet will do.
---
The only thing that was cool about gyros was that the Stealth Gyro lasted FOR-EVER.  Now, it lasts for 5 seconds (+10 seconds after the gyro goes away).
---
The PvP league last way longer tho.  The wvw chests reset every week.  Unless I’m mistaken and the sPvP ones do that too.
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **6th Cakeday** Nike_Phoros! ^(hug)
---
I am straight up saying it is pitiful burst, didn't even mention DPS.
---
arcdps has a graphical mode that lets you see the exact moment you peak at damage wise and by how much.
---
you can still shoot people with it on the ground. It just depends on who you're aiming at.
---
The bug's are the brick, once they're gone everything'll devolve to whinging about flavor and purpose.
---
Thank you! I spent quite some time on this and would at least like to know what People disagree with.
---
In spvp it's far more balanced because there's a crit damage cap alongside fixed crit %.
---
In WvW it's all PvE gear made even more busted by food, utilities, and runes not available in spvp.
---
But even in spvp it's extremely powerful relative to other games, especially because thieves have low cd's on their heal skills, high endurance regen, and the fact that most skills hit for 4-5k and thieves can dodge more of those alongside better disengage tools means that they have more effective health pools than something like a necromancer.
---
I've send a clip about this over to ben yesterday, they are aware and working on fixes hopefully soon. In total i've sent him about 10ish explots to fix.
---
Likewise, in PvP you have fewer options to specc into defence, so even if they are hitting "softer", the enemy also have lower defenses that come with serious drawbacks (there is not a single healing amulet with toughness, except celestial which comes with a lot of "wasted" stats for most builds). I think stealth suffers from a philosophy problem; it was designed with PvE in mind, and PvP as an afterthought. Most PvP games have implemented counterplays around stealth, GW2 tried this with "revealed", but gave it to a select few classes, on skills that are at times hard to fit in builds, and then gave the class with the highest stealth uptime the means to remove the only thing that could prevent them from stealthing, effectively creating a counterplay to the already hard-to-come-by-and-apply counterplay itself.
---
I think it takes guts to go back and admit that the design is flawed, and even more effort to balance a whole class (and several other skills) around that decision alone, so we probably will continue to see more "counterplay to counterplay" and patch-work to try to fix this, rather than tackling the problem at the root. Personally I think the easiest solutions is that both hard CC and 10-20% max health damage inflicted on the stealthed class should reveal them. Reward people actively working on removing the stealth, reward classes actively avoiding getting hit with those, it will create new strategies, like using AoE on one self, or going to choke points or agaisnt a wall and using skills in front of you, or predicting their movement and using an accurate CC skill, or anticipating their stealth and placing a field on their feet, etc. It is the other's job to anticipate or outmaneuver the attacker. Right now, nothing stops them from stealthing right in your face, either teleporting behind you or away from you, or sideways or whatever else they want.
---
You are too savage for my own good.
---
Sandswept Isle has a bug?
---
I'm shocked! Shocked!
---
...Well, not that shocked.
---
Shortbow is reliant on flanking, dagger isn't.
---
Yes, no one can help you understand why people are posting this. Good point. 
---
Everything does not need to be the best, because then everything would be the same.
---
My logic is sound...yours...well...it's something.
---
One thing to point out, Dagger Torch benchmark uses Iboga, which is mostly for the Confusion damage. In a real raid, it would do a bit more since the Golem doesn't attack.
---
Between the two builds, the only reason I'd suggest Shortbow/Shortbow is if you're really new to the content. Other than that, take whats easier to gear or looks more fun to you. It doesn't matter for the most part.
---
Cant Speak for PvP , but WvW many times trhows shit on casuals cause the mentality of the guilds there its more competitive , they wanna fight, learn and get better as a whole and better players. Casual players that doesnt play wvw so much, will be lost and in many times, they will not progress in skill with their professions. Im not saying this is the right way to treat casual players, but that's what happens most off the time , WvW right now isnt server pride, but Guild Pride, to be recognized as a good guild , that one that you play against and you know they will give you a great fight , or a headache cuz they use good strategies and make you think how to win them.

Said something similar in anthor comment, but yeah, in WvW , performance matter a lot , many guilds play their pride on WvW. 
---
&gt; Everything does not need to be the best, because then everything would be the same.
---
Despite the mount system in itself being set up obviously contrary to your reasoning. Every mount has its niche where it is exactly better than every other mount (except for perhaps the raptor, it has been rather power creeped by the beetle in its intended role).   
---
The problem lies in the fact that warclaw does not have any real role in the game. It's a downgrared jackal knock off. 
---
iirc they already have de-mount trap planned?
---
&gt; You can continue trying to justify your actions to yourself all you want, but the reality of the situation is as simple as: you are wide-spreading exploits that actually give players a benefit in a competitive mode.
---
English is a very complicated language when you can't comprehend it.
---
&gt;They should have tested or at least made players test their new content anyways (like they did back in POF release). 
---
They used to have external testing with players in raids. It lead to exploits not only not being reported, but leaking massively straight on release. Remember w4 and w5? Despite the thing you are saying about "gandara community" (isn't gandara a bloated pug server? How can you speak for hundreds of randoms on it?), wvw players are much less dependable than even raid players (for many reasons, they lack of any kind of established reputation, gamemode is competetive by nature, etc) and really, really shouldn't be trusted with this. 
---
I'll also join that guy above in saying that what you are doing here is purely pointless and harmful, unless you believe that publicity will up the priority of this issue for anet. It probably won't. 
---
Meanwhile, the poor guy who still doesn't have a mount, trying to catch up with the zerg.
---
Reddit knows balance
---
&gt;An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to one’s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or **a sequence of commands** that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability **to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur** on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). 
---
So, how do you think, was this kind of access to this tower intended by developers?
---
No one expects the Ballista Inquisition!
---
Pretty sure just about any standard roamer build can solo a keep lord given enough time
---
ofcause you can profit. You put the portal down before you do a difficult jump and if you fail it you can port back up. The portal is not made for jps but mainly for rotating in pvp, poralbombing, transporting golems and porting the zerg in a keep in  wvw and skips in pve.
---
Even tho the game mode is competitive, regular WvW'ers and all the commanders that i know do not choose to abuse these exploits and all the people who are new to WvW don't even know what to do in WvW. They are just following the zerg. This is my observation over the past 3 days. But you are right, i shouldn't have spoken for a whole server cause i saw some people abusing the system recently yet i still defend that the regular WvW'ers and the commanders do not and will not try to abuse the system ever.
---
The best you have as a mesmer is a safety portal. If there is a hard jump you can lay a portal in case you fall. Otherwise, a mesmer jumps the same as everyone else...as it should be.
---
If the leap is very far and thus onto a lower area, sometimes it can only be done if the keep is yours. Due to higher speed when in free fall. The jump range itself without the freefall part is the same in allied and enemy territory. 
---
You can also glitch slightly upwards by dismounting at the right time similar to how weaponswap and leap issues worked. It requires some practise but one skilled mesmer is really all it takes. 
---
It's also a nice safe measure for falling (if the fall is not lethal)
---
&gt; Why don't you change your tampon?
---
I will when dummies stop crying about pve scrapper being bad
---
Still have r/Guildwarsgonewild and r/TyriaAfterDark though.
---
It's way to early to say i told you so either way.
---
You can put your portal down before a difficult jump. If you fail the jump, assuming you are alive and within 5k range, you can open the portal and try again. 
---
Almost all jumping puzzles are made so that you can't teleport up using a blink/shadowstep/other teleport most of the time, so you can't cheese them that way.
---
Best class for JPs would actually be Necro imo, since spectral walk allows you to return to your previous position even while falling. You just have to wait for it a bit while you can portal twice on Mesmer.
---
Thanks a ton. I’m pretty low on gold at the moment, what would you say is the best way to find those kinds of gear pieces?
---
I did queen beetle a couple of times in the last couple of weeks.
---
I feel you aren't getting my point. Its irrelevant if scrapper is bad in PVE because its not a PvE spec.  
---
&gt;How much would you recommend us waiting until people figure out gyro rework did absolutely nothing for PvE Scrapper?
---
I wasn't talking about PvE there, you brought up "other game modes" and I was referencing them, and then I make a new line where I brought the topic back to PvE. Keep up.
---
Oh sweetie, that *one* thing is kinda a big deal. 
---
not sure about around HoT time; but i distinctly remember a lot of engi heydays; nade engi (way back when burn was stronger but only stacked duration), bunker engis, decap engis, turret engis (fuck that period of time)
---
Double shortbow looks boring ^^
---
Very true, I always forget about that one.
---
&gt;Gyros are much better now
---
eh not really; id argue most got worse (stealth and heal are better though)
---
Check out metabattle for proper builds for WvW.
---
Meta is Minstrel Firebrand, Scourge (power or cele), and power Rev.
---
GW1 was founded on PvP.  Yet, it appears Anet found out that PvE content was easier to monetize.   They continued this trend with GW2 despite making a good effort in the beginning. 
---
I think they need to approach monetization differently.  I don't think PvP has to be low profit.  Look at games like Fortnite that were very profitable (albeit perhaps only a short time).  
---
Or perhaps the game mode is inherently low profit.  They don't appear to be a large subset of any game that has a long existence. 
---
&gt; Does he give high fury uptime so druid doesn't have to bring storm spirit?
---
Don't know, but if no: Pack runes. Same for heal scourge, staff tempest or non axe fb.
---
&gt; More regen for 2nd group than druid can provide with water spirit?
---
Is using water spirit in your eyes good or negative? 
---
* Magi scrapper's regeneration is ofc stronger than harrier druid's
---
* Harrier scrapper weaker because a full harrier druid with sigil of concentration overcaps on concentration and therefor uses one magi trinket, resulting in higher healing power for the druid compared to scrapper. This means water spirit's regeneration is 10 man.
---
&gt; What about protection
---
[Over Shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Over_Shield), Stone spirit (10 man), chrono shield 4 (both subgroups)
---
&gt; Might?
---
[Do I really I have to explain how druid applies 10 man might?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grace_of_the_Land)
---
&gt; Dmg modifiers that druid gives? Spotter
---
No, scrapper has no offensive modifieres like druid. Same goes for tempest and scourge. What would be the point if everyone could? Traited Glpyh of Empowerment is a strong and unique skill. 
---
&gt; Spotter and frost + sun spirits
---
Spirits are ranger skills, not druid. This means a soulbeast can bring them (Hybrid builds are awesome, imagine a team comp where 9 to 10 players are dealing 15-25k dps). 
---
You are thinking about double spotter because you want to be "optimal". If you would want to run optimal comps you would run no healers at Sabetha, single druid push/healer at Desmina, single heal at VG or Dhuum. Do you? I guess not. 
---
&gt; Heal scrapper as secondary heal would be somewhere near a good idea if he could bring all those things or something unique 
---
* [Can druid give instant on demand 3 stacks of stability while blocking projectiles?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defense_Field)
---
* [Can druid massive heal 24/7 without the need of energy or a target?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Med_Kit)
---
* [Can drop a 17 seconds lasting field that rezzes players by 17% (before heal modifiers) per pulse?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Toss_Elixir_R)
---
I don't think so. Each spec is unique and that's good.
---
&gt;  if somebody wants to bring heal scrapper I take it as a joke.
---
You're a joke dude.
---
but you can combo that smoke field for so much more invis, and from what i can tell; enemies cant even see the smoke field so theres no giveaway of an unstealthed gyro trundling around
---
Care to explain the alternate recipe?
---
Considering that in theory you can run healer, and have both a power and condi setup with holosmith...i think that the balance situation is pretty much fine for engi.
---
So because WvWers want to win they shouldn't be trusted?
---
Why shouldn't WvWers use their mounts provided by Anet to get into things if it clearly is easy to do so?
---
Do you ask PvEers not to action cancel?
---
This is exactly the problem I realized. All the time when I see someone on a mount I just start running around them waiting for them to jump off or attack me first and then it's a easy kill. Or were both just running around eachother for ages waiting for someone to attack first then end up getting bored and run away. Maybe one way to fix the problem is give the warclaw the same health as the player so if you kill the warclaw you kill the player. Not sure but would love to hear other ideas how to fix it. 
---
Is action-cancelling intended behavior? Cuz skills have after casts for a reason.
---
Ask Anet to not put the gift of battle in WvW reward tracks, and then I'l consider staying out of your playground as a filthy casual, mate.
---
&gt;Vabbi builds
---
i dident know about Vabbi Builds, thank you :D
---
\&gt;  But those casuals arent enjoying themselves...
---
Not when monkeys keep screeching and throwing their own feces at them. Do you enjoy it when monkeys screech at you and throw their feces at you?
---
Also, even by this logic, this meme is complete garbage in the first place, as I made obvious (or so I thought) in my post.
---
\&gt; So yes, there are enough reasons for wvw vets to be pissed off with casuals.
---
Wrong! You have no actual reason to be "pissed off with casuals". You merely want a target for your frustrations.
---
The "WvW vets" in question are never happy, unless they are complaining, irrelevant of who the opposition is. So much so that they will insult and berate anyone that holds a different opinion than their own (classified as not a "WvW vet" because of differing views, and therefore a "casual"). These players, which from the sounds of it includes you, are the equivalent of those self-proclaimed PvPers and wannabe raid elitists.
---
You know what you're doing when you do that? You're exercising in-group bias. You want a sense of belonging, and you're average; so, you think like an average person.
---
There is also a personal portal device that all professions can use. Very useful when you miss jumps or fall. 
---
You can’t usually skip jumping puzzles because mounts and gliding are disabled, and blinks or teleports simply won’t work or help _that_ much. 
---
I suppose now that Gyros count as wells you can use them with [Superior Rune of the Chronomancer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Chronomancer) to provide quickness. It doesn't seem all that useful because all the other stats on that rune are pretty bad for what Scrapper wants to do, though.
---
&gt;achieves lackluster DPS.
---
Oh boy you must be new. Mesmer has the best raw burst DPS in the entire game and Mirage is by far one of the best DPS classes overall for PvP.
---
Metabattle is better.
---
Player voicing is just one vector to look at things like this. I am assuming ArenaNet actually tracks different game modes and what kind of classes people take to them. They should quickly see that no one takes Scrapper.
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
Taking scrapper makes engineer healing worse. You're better off taking tools almost solely for belt CD reduction so that you can throw more elixirs and use the elixir gun belt to maintain 25 might.
---
The excuse of "it only needs to be good in pvp" only applies to Scrapper for some reason. Every spec has multiple trait choices. There is split balance. This excuse doesn't fly, especially when the profession mechanic (function gyro) isn't useful unless your allies have already screwed up, and stomping has no purpose in pve.
---
almost all (spectral walk :P)
---
Hell, not even a meta event, but some weird offshoot dynamic event that leads to an escort mission to the one PoI that gets bugged every other patch.
---
It's a fun class to play tbh and leveling isn't really a problem since the core game is so easy.
---
Greatsword does some neat burst damage from distance and the clones distract foes so sometimes you can kill a mob before they have chance to touch you.
---
Just git gud and you don't have to use neither waypoint nor mount to run.
---
Man up would be the second possible solution. 
---
you'll have to invest some into leatherworking. Luckily marauder's isn't terribly expensive. You can buy the insignia recipe at your crafting station. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marauder_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia
---
Then use discovery to make the pieces.
---
Participation is stupid easy to get for anyone who fights one or two fights you are max
---
so you are telling me you use your mounts only for puzzles? i literally always use raptor on every single map (never bothered getting griffon) to jump over cliffs or to shorten the pathing and whatnot. sometimes i jump from stuff to see where i can land etc. while in your heads there might be a difference between jumping from cliff to cliff and jumping from wall to wall, for me its the same.
---
i dont understand how its a surprise to anyone, that people would try the exact same thing when a basically reskinned raptor would be released in wvw.....
---
The stats you want are Power, Precision and Ferocity. Traditionally you should be able to get by with Berserker's. As Titian mentioned, you *could* do Marauder's for some more survivability. 
---
Personally, I don't recommend that. I'd say just go grab some Berserker's.
---
When my wife got her DD to the expansions she had similar troubles until I got her in all Beserker's gear. Then she was like "Oh! Everything dies really fast now, so I don't die as often!". 
---
Aim to get full Berserker exotics, IMO. This means armor, weapons, **and** trinkets. I made the mistake, originally, of assuming trinkets weren't that important. You'll want a backpiece, amulet, two accessories, and two rings.
---
Should cost you around 25g. Use the trading post filters to search for level 80 exotic gear with power, precision, and ferocity stats. Then buy the named gear (I think it's Nika's for medium? Sort by price, one will be WAY cheaper. It won't say Berserker's, but it'll have the same stats. Make sure you don't accidentally buy Assassin's. Berserkers will have Power as the highest stat, Assassin's will have Precision). You'll be hitting things MUCH harder, they'll die very quickly, and you shouldn't struggle to survive as much.
---
That guide Titian linked will definitely help you. Take that build. 
---
The Invigorating Precision trait in Critical Strikes will help you survive. That'll heal you on crits, which combined with the heal skill Signet of Malice (what I'd recommend taking, though that's more personal preference. I guess channeled vigor is fine, more of a burst heal) will keep you up pretty well.
---
I was positive about the change before the patch hit and still am. I have basically played nothing but WvW since launch and I mostly. Right now I'm enjoying how fast paced the action is, there is barely any pirate shipping and with the mount finishing downed players it feels like it's a no downed week v.2. After the dust settles and queues dies things might be a bit different then, but right now I'm having a good time.
---
This problem is the reason why I made this post. If both players know the problem, they hope, that the other player attacks. People who don't want to fight will run away. That's boring for the roamer but I think, that we have to accept it. Killing a player with a zerg build is mostly a boring fight anyways. 
---
But in the case you described,  BOTH players want to fight but they don't want the disadvantage you get by attacking first.
---
yes
---
[builds.vabbi.org](https://builds.vabbi.org)
---
Currently working on updating the builds, but right now there's so much clownfiesta going on that we can't decide what really works and what doesn't since we can win blob fights by going full core specs...
---
I finally played last night and I loved it. My new character slot is going to be dedicated to WVW so I can work on the correct class/build/gear. I see the difference in a veteran commander too. Was invited to discord that has a DJ playing music. Just one more reason for me to love this game. 
---
Ideally, yes.
---
As of now, every single Elite spec has some purpose somewhere in endgame PvE. Except Scrapper. Even Reaper is fluttering on the edge of viability for skilled groups, and is even optimal for struggling teams in a lot of cases. Even Herald is getting into at least a respectable place now after being overshadowed by Renegade in every practical way for a while. And Spellbreaker, while being designed for PvP content like Scrapper, has a comfortable place in Fractals with certain instab combinations and Qadim/Dhuum.
---
Aside from core specs, which are honestly pretty left-behind outside Warrior and Engineer, Scrapper is the sole exception for PvE non-viability.
---
The entire elite specs identity is tied up in being a utility bruiser. Something essentially useless in this game's pve because the encounter design doesn't warrant it. 
---
says "ez" and then misses his jump
---
Oh I couldn't agree more, felt so good to be able to run away from skillful group of holo, mirage, daredevil and deadeye yesterday. On my reaper.
---
Press V to dodge
---
I had a scrapper in my t4 fractal group the other day and I actually didn't know what the profession icon was near their portrait. Not sure how good they were though.
---
Since you seem to be focused on healing, [Superior Rune of the Monk](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Monk) may be worth the time investment to get. However, if you're going to running with pugs rather than a guild group, you may want to be a bit more selfish and consider the [Superior Rune of Rebirth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Rebirth). When you see that massive barrier proc from the rune, you'll know it's time to get the hell out of Dodge.
---
Disastrous.
---
It's far worse than I thought.
---
It is far too fast, even in enemy territory.
---
Its dash is far too long. It generates endurance far too fast. 900 range dash every three seconds is broken.
---
Its engage skill is ridiculous, even with the recent nerf. It still does too much damage, and it should never be able to stomp.
---
Its immunity to CC and lack of combat movement speed penalty is far more of a problem than I anticipated.
---
The only thing about the mount that lived up to my expectations is the gate pull ability: it is exactly as useless as I thought it would be.
---
Overall, the warclaw is a terrible addition to WvW. It isn't apparent now, but once the population spike goes down, it would be obvious how almost every aspect of WvW is negatively affected.
---
And in addition to exotic gear, look at obtaining some ascended gear from some of the easy or cheap sources like Living World maps or whatever is most recommended these days.
---
To be honest unless you are new to the WvW that is not a great accomplishment, especially on permastealth DE. Now if you managed to pull this of on non stealth class like ele or necro that would be something. 
---
One thing I actually find funny with the warclaw is how likely I am just to ride past an enemy. On foot, we would probably take a potshot which might escalate into a brawl neither of us might want. On the warclaw, we just ride past eachother minding out own business.
---
Scrapper move set is slow and limited to melee range only while. While its got Engineer's Utily. it really lack some that cover its weakness in PVE mainly no easy to play open world build.
---
Would love to see a new mid range kit or rework hammer/Utility skill to have more reliable gap closer skill . Or do a PVE split for hammer to lower overall cool down
---
You are right, but the PvE hivemind will eat this up, and then abandon WvW to go sit around lion's arch.
---
There will be a dismount trap, but it won't be anywhere near as ridiculously overpowered as what you've suggested. Mounted players will be forcibly dismounted and it will ignore unmounted players. It'll also cost only 10 supply, not 15.
---
If what you want is help with jumping puzzles, what you want is two things:
---
* A necromancer with Spectral Walk.
---
* A [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder).
---
Portals work better to help others rather than yourself.
---
I suppose in a way other classes have it a bit easier than others: I roamed on my warrior a bit and I was getting pretty frustrated but when I switched to my pew pew ranger dismounting players was laughably easy, 1 rapid fire and poof!
---
I'm not sure about making them CCable. It makes flanking big zergs totally doable. Forces them to move around to avoid your pounce.
---
Pirate Ship is boring.
---
I'm ready to see it play its way out longer before more nerfing of the mounts.
---
Living world maps ....
---
Because they don't design taking anything but PvP in account, that's the issue.
---
Scrapper was blatantly made for PvP. The function gyro is terrible in any other mode - enemies in PvE have no down state, save for rare exceptions, so you can't even finish them.
---
It was designed as a tanky bruiser and it worked quite well - hammers doesn't do much damage wise, but between that, skills and traits, he could defend a position well. The issue is, when your mode is all about defending small nodes versus a couple other players, that is enough to make people whine. Even if it's all you can do. And even if it's useless in any other mode.
---
So they made the same thing they've done with turrets - an utility designed over defending a point. That is, nerf it until it wasn't worthwhile anymore.
---
And given it was useless even in the circumstances it was designed for, it couldn't work anywhere else.
---
Now we're seeing the same issues with the new gyros. Combo fields in zerg battles just don't work well, so half of the effect is already gone. Bulwark Gyro is a suicide button in WvW zergs, yet it works nicely in PvP (since you don't have more than 5 opponents blasting you from all the sides) and you already have people whining to reduce the barrier it provides.
---
What will likely happens is they'll nerf the hell out of the new gyros due to their performance in PvP and they'll end up unused yet again in any other mode. Just as usual.
---
How do you play with camera shake on....
---
I'm a lurker, it's what I do
---
It's called counters and weaknesses.
---
A necro for example, is slow, relatively unmobile, and becomes a spinning or pulsing death machine if you get near him.  You counter him with range or mobility.
---
A thief is not a spinning/pulsing death machine, but more so someone that with the exception of st ealth bursts, generally tickles people to death while dancing in and out of harm. 
---
Now, there's still an in combat mobility advantage, but it's now offset by "oh. the thief got range, let me get some range, mount up, and peace out".
---
There's little reason to play my thief other than i enjoy him, over say, my guardian now.
---
Share it as much as possible.  You don't need his permission.  Especially since it lights a fire under their asses.
---
Not an issue for me tbh. I didn't even notice it's on until you say it. If slight screen shake bothers you then you're going to struggle as a Firebrand in WvW juggling condi control LOL.
---
Worth a shot to turn it off tbh. (Though I'm pretty sure it's off)
---
Ok
---
Allow Cripple+Imob to inflict a % of the mounts health as long as either last.
---
It doesn't have to slow them but would help people dismount them. I've always hated how mounts ignore those condis.
---
As far as I’ve seen, it’s a term that exists purely in EU. Literally never seen anyone NA say this unironically. 
---
It's not like exploiting movement to bypass terrain features is the only negative impact of the mount system.
---
The extra movement speed boost in friendly territory needs to be removed or heavily reduced. As long as you have people that are actually awake and scouting it's too easy to defend a keep when you can get a full zerg moving with permanent super speed. Increasing the movement speed of defensive forces by 50% is just a weird design decision.
---
And as amusing as it is for me as a necromancer to be effectively roamer immune, it kills off lots of strategic use for roamers if they can't effectively engage small mounted groups. Reduce the mount HP and number of dodges in exchange for not being disabled when dismounted and/or add some traps to stop mounts so there's room for actual counter play.
---
Besides the impact on regular WvW game play, new players are pretty screwed for the first X hours (pips for tickets) while they try to keep up with mounted commanders until they can get their own mounts, and people without Path of Fire are just permanently screwed until they open their wallets.
---
Alternatively, they're one more change away from turning WvW into a zerg vs. zerg theme park feature. If they add permanent watch towers to every structure it'll remove most of the need for scouting and people can zoom around from objective to objective on their mounts like they were in a PVE map like Silverwastes. 
---
Of course then they'd have to actually make every profession useful for big fights.
---
Legendaries pretend to be crafted using every game mode, also you can farm GoB in EotM, not normal wvw maps.
---
If yoy get offended for being called casual not my problem, never gave any names, just talked in general, butthurt? 
---
It depends a lot on what you want to do. For open world, I'd definitely go for D/T, great aoe cleave and you absolutely destroy vets/champs with bonfire/traps/entangle and then just moving out. Also access to quickness and leap finisher on dagger3.
---
As far as raids go, it depends a little. Sb\^3 offers a very simple rotation with very high dps uptime, as nearly all attacks are ranged. D/T has a higher burst, access to sun spirit with no dps loss, access to confusion (great on fast bosses). If the boss moves a lot and you cannot land bonfire, then Sb\^3. In training runs, Sb\^3. Otherwise, I'd go D/T. 
---
Also, in regards to the benchmark, while using lynx for both builds, I kept getting 1k higher dps for D/T after the patch. Changing for Iboga on a raid scenario, D/T will pull even further ahead.
---
Finally, consider that just changing traits from D/T to SB\^3 will yield better results with runes of the lich, than the other way around with krait runes.
---
Probably someone from NCSoft West that doesn't know how it works
---
My condi scourge got completely outdated by warclaw. I cant even tag bodies now. People are insta dead. Guess ill need to make cele or marauder gear now.....mehhhhh 
---
Worth. Also you can farm 60 gold in 1day :)
---
This worked 
---
Why didn't you bold the part about taking advantage of a bug, because that's the central part of the definition?
---
To add to this, even though my overall opinion is less negative; the Warclaw has turned WvW into purely objective-based gameplay with very little fighting. You currency have two groups of people playing WvW: 1) People with the Warclaw who rush to objectives to cap them for farming and 2) People who are rushing to objectives on foot in order to unlock the Warclaw.
---
Naturally finding fights as a group in the open is very difficult to do now, groups move so fast that they never see each other on the way to an objective. Every fight I was part of yesterday involved a tower or keep. There were at least two, if not three main groups on T1 Desert Borderlands last night who were not engaging each other, but instead rotating around the map capping behind each other. The Warclaw is encouraging more k-training than ever before.
---
I've tried condi zerker and I just hate how much time you gotta sit in melee range with a longbow, just feels goofy?
---
Assuming you can only play pvp for an hour a day, pvp matches at most at 15min + que time. So lets say you can get 3 matchs per hour. Say you can only do this 5 days a week so thats 5hours of pvp a week over the course of 8 weeks at 15matches a week thats 120 total matches over 40hours of play. Assuming that you never get any top stats or near victories and are below plat rank, you will get 10 pips for a win and 3 for a lose. Im going to also assume a 50% win rate because that seems fair. Now it takes 670 pips to get to Byzantium the first time. Playing 15 matches over the course of 5 hours a week over a 8 week period gets you to 120 matches per season, assuming that 50% win rate (no top stats or near wins and lower than plat rank, these give extra pips) that comes out to 780 pips per season, congratz you are 70pips shy of the first repeatable Byzantium chest for that season.
---
So the numbers on match length and matches per hour are on the bad side, ie max duration matches long que times. It does seem to be a stretch to say you would need to dedicate your life to pvp for 8 weeks to get the Byzantium chest done.
---
Why I give examples of weapons is because that kind of thinking almost always spreads equally into weapons, trait lines and utilities. 
---
So I took much of that baggage into my reponse. What I am against is this whole kind of thinking not necessarely scrapper specific.
---
'Everything should be good everywhere and every class should have their own builds equal of chronomancer support...', but that isn't possible because different content require different things and practically you cannot have everything excel everwhere.
---
No elite spec is limited to single gamemode including scrapper but there is usually a clear vision for what the traits&amp;utilities are made for.
---
Most of Spellbreakers kit is as if (because it is) created for PvP&amp;WvW. It is fine (or bad, depends how we define this) in PvE just because Warrior is good. But the whole design of traits and utilities screams PvP&amp;WvW. 
---
Firebrand is very succesful in creating numerous playstyles for all game modes but it's quite obvious as a complete package using everything it has to offer it is a build created for PvP/WvW. 
---
Renegade is very much PvE focused, almost nothing is designed on it for PvP/WvW and it would be foolish to cry about it.
---
Scrapper has been good in PvP and now in WvW in hybrid, utility and support roles. And what is good about it for say Open World PvE is the self buffing potential and these kind of builds are often in trouble in more difficult group setting.
---
They could boost Shredder gyro by 40% to make it same as Laser Disk. But what I am against is that everything should be equal because PvE has a boring metric for it.
---
Yeah, it really is. Firebrand, Scourge, Renegade, or Mirage? are the go to condi builds atm, I believe. 
---
Check out the builds on snowcrows.com for the "meta" builds.
---
I would be happy with Monthlies coming back. my old guild used to have the odd jumping puzzle night to get some done. it was a good way to hook up and do stuff toegther
---
F for both in the chat D:
---
You talking smack about my guitar wielding Reaper? 
---
Seriously, there are a ton of players not using GS. I'd say probably more not than do.
---
Im sorry but the above seems more like wishful thinking, not making expansion will hurt them badly but at this point i doubt they care.
---
This is gold!
---
Now I'm a fan of Kyle too!
---
This does raise a lot of points I think are very important to consider going forward.  Expansions or not, Living Story has become increasingly confined as we go forward.  No matter how big you make each map, the fact remains that the story is almost entirely limited to that one map.  If we go somewhere, we will *never* be able to go back, because of the problematic paywall system.
---
If we can get rid of that, not only will more players be able to be a part of the story, but the story itself will be able to expand well beyond its current limitations.
---
And, moving into LS5 soon, I have to wonder what it will be tied to.  Will someone be required to own PoF to access it?  Will it simply require the account to not be a free version?
---
For that matter, will maps be designed with PoF (read: mounts) or HoT (read: gliders) in mind? Or will the design be catered entirely to some new kind of movement-based mastery?
---
While I don't think the expansion-paywall-tied model is ideal, I think we have to be very analytical with how things are handled going forward.  There's plenty of room to improve the system, but it would have heavy implications whatever direction they take.
---
One option, if you've got the resources to change things around, might be to run Forgeman Runes and Plaguedoctor jewelry or armor. With Forgeman you'd have to be careful to not significantly go over 100% burning.
---
I'd rather do 8 hearts for two days, then 1 heart for 16 days.
---
Timegating is really fucking annoying.
---
Dunno, the stealth abuse seems rough still had a gank squad of stealthers, engi, thief, ranger and mez that were super pita.   Could pop in gank, insta stomp stealth an be miles away.
---
How long did you live like this?
---
Nah. The sword builds are decent.
---
&gt;If we go somewhere, we will *never* be able to go back, because of the problematic paywall system.
---
Now that you Mention that I gotta agree here. I think it's great that we get something new to explore every Episode, but a lot of These maps feel like wasted potential since we're as per Business model never going back.   
---
It also made expansions as Paywall before LS episodes almost necessary, since we Need some sort of close-by common Ground like Cities or Hubs to start the episodes from.   
---
This could be avoided by reusing them in instanced Story steps, but that feels kinda cheap.  
---
war is dead in fractals,its just better to take 3rd dps,CC can do anyone who has boulder or gear to spam 300 worth of cc. its good solo class,no1 denying that. mesmer have boon strip on shatter tho,that means than in ideal conditions you can strip in half sec 4 boons on demand. war is meme since hes getting nothing,but nerfs in last  3 years and chrono slowly catching up.
---
awesome this sounds like the idea balance of things.  If you were to buy a beginner exotic set would you go with Carrion?
---
Thanks.
---
Kinda funny that I wouldn't have paid any attention to this tweet at all if that's the promotion without the error.
---
Please bring a class that's actually useful. You don't bring your core ranger or necro to fractals or raids, don't bring them to wvw. They're useless there too.
---
What to play if you want in a squad: guardian (preferably firebrand), scourge, herald, scrapper, weaver, tempest, chrono, or spellbreaker. 
---
As /u/ChaliElle stated below we are working through the exploits that have been reported. Some of these can take longer than others to fix but we're on it. 
---
What if I told you your winrate and rating wouldn't change?
---
I love this art style.
---
More importantly, MOBAs are competitive, and suck new players in, regardless of the presence or absence of original content. The playerbase of the gnere, as a whole, is huge.
---
The playerbase of the MMO genre is smaller. Most new players of an MMO are cannibalized from a competing MMO. You can only make this work if you've released something new, or your competition really, really fucking flopped.
---
Guess what? World of Warcraft has released not one, but two flops, in their past 3 expansions. Guild Wars 2 failed to capitalize on this - in a big way.
---
People still use Twitter?
---
Trying to get us to use up all our gems so we have to buy more at the end of the month.. tricky dickies
---
IF they are actually working on their game now, they could possibly try to optimize the game, work on an expansion and delivering good content such as balance patches, events, etc + the stuff you listed.
---
But that would only help maintain a small portion of the current playerbase. What ANET needs to focus on mostly (not entirely) is delivering a good expansion.
---
Also i know you did point out you're not against expansions, but you do make it sound like MMOs are fine even without expansions, which they are not, unfortunately.
---
Trying to get us to spend all our gems first so we have to buy more... clever lol
---
I play this game from launch and i will play it untill servers are down or im down but i dont share your hope. At this game age and with nc soft on the watch i do think gw2 days are numbered and the most we can count is full season 5.
---
I had no idea that you can refresh siege! Thank you for that info!
---
True. 
---
Tbh that seems like a Problem so big, especially from a creator perspective, the devs themselves probably noticed that by now. Makes me actually somewhat hopeful theyl somehowl adress this in S5... 
---
You are running a 2. Shortboe on Dagger anyway, so it doesnt matter, you have to be flanking anyways. 
---
yeah, i tought 5 was good too, but i realized how easily you can use this skill and even 3 seems a bit too much, but it's ok, less would have been weirder.
---
I think you have some good ideas, but in truth my feeling is that ArenaNet would have to implement these **and also** bring out expansions to actually maintain interest in the game, which is even more "wishful thinking" than what you suggest in the OP.
---
From my own experience, I feel the company has thousands of miles to go just on the "Promote Community Interaction" bullet point. I'm someone who interacted with the company a fair bit when hosting events and my blog was popular, but my main way of reaching Gaile was (I kid you not) through a support ticket that became a single email chain of almost 50 emails. While I appreciate the support the company gave to me, I always felt like I had to be the one trying to constantly get their attention and point out exactly what was going on. Despite being a complete volunteer, I always felt like I was giving 200% effort while receiving polite but soulless responses.
---
I never really received any resources to help me out (aside from general moral support) despite being dedicated to helping bring a bit of positivity to the community. To now discover ArenaNet wasted time, money and energy on at least two cancelled projects over the last few years while rejecting the requests of community organisers trying to keep their game fresh makes me salty, and right now I have no inclination at all to restart those sorts of activities.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Anet is usually pretty nice with these things, might take a couple days since it's not a urgent matter, but if you make a ticket you will definitely get your legendary back. Since you have screenshot of the splitter and a lot of informations you don't have to sweat it.
---
Just make sure you make an official ticket with support and be patient. If you the support isn't helping, make sure to ask for someone else to review your ticket.
---
I use scrapper for open world perma swiftness and 15 seconds of stealth for gathering in living world maps.  Also the gyro changes means scrapper support is legit 
---
Looks like the Warclaw needed a nap.
---
As a roamer i really loved it so far.
---
Today i solo roamed ruins with it, and felt like a proper hunter [playing power soulbeast for, uh.. roleplay purposes :P ]
---
It's not the engage skill, more for "sniff" and not investing on swiftness skills or passive utilities to check the zone faster, i didn't even had any advantage on fights, i just found people easily and it felt good.
---
You're basically me until only a couple of months ago. Since then I've actually had more fun with Condi classes.
---
Really been enjoying Condi Mirage and Soulbeast. Not sure that they're the best, but they are definitely fun for PVE.
---
So... it’s their fault that they weren’t paying attention to a shifting system that was fundamentally broken in the first place after they had stopped playing and didn’t come back before said system was entirely removed? Really? That’s on them and not on Anet for figuring out these edge cases?
---
Please.
---
That's gonna be fixed, don't worry.
---
&gt; It *seems* to me that mounts will essentially make it impossible to escape a fight in enemy territory.  Am I wrong?
---
That depents on the Group you're facing.
---
* A zerg usualy wont bother with 2 or 3 romer, since it's not worth the time
---
* A small Group will usualy not have the dmg to get you off your mount (atleast to my experience) 
---
Just remember if an enemy is on a mount and engages you he wont be on his mount any longer while you still are and as soon he isn't in fight anymore you probably wont be in fight anymore as well.
---
&gt; are large groups going to be the only viable way to survive outside your own territory? 
---
No but Medium-Large will be the only Groups that can engage an enemy that does not want to be engaged
---
Getting to 2000 AP gives you 500 badges, so back then you could get it without spending more than 30 seconds in WvW.
---
(Obviously you need to get 2000 AP first, but that wasn’t that hard if you’re at the point where you’re making a legendary.)
---
Their functionality might've been changed, but if, given Anet's track record with bugs, spaghetti code and stuff breaking unintentionally as a side effect of changes to something else, you think this was actually intentional, then I care even less whatever kind of people you'd lump me with. 
---
There are legendary collection mandatory events that are still bugged to this day too.  Hopefully this gets fixed but I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Wow 5 min and not even a single scout? I wonder which server could've done this to themselves.
---
Need to look into more MMOs there mate. An MMO called Maplestory has no expansions and is alive.
---
Warclaw did nothing wrong 
---
&gt; Scrapper has been good in PvP
---
I can't address everything you type but this one thing in particular is pretty disjointed from reality: scrapper hasn't been a thing in PvP since Holosmith appeared, even before it sustained heavy nerfs and got displaced out of the PvP meta.
---
Pros to BL contract:
---
* It's a set amount of gold on the TP that's less then the other ones
---
Cons:
---
* praying for the price on the TP to be lower
---
* People being annoyed about your merch being there and being unable to use it
---
Pros to either of the ecto gambling ones:
---
* You miiiight turn a profit
---
* With the sandswept one you can get 32 slot bag runes
---
* A very minor achivo! Hooray!
---
* "Achieving the Legendary Tarrktun Supporter achievement costs 10000 Gold coin and 25000 Globs of Ectoplasm, not factoring in any return profit."
---
* potential gambling addiction
---
It's not confirmed to be an exploit, it's confirmed as being unexpected. 
---
As far as bolding sections of text, it's a really simple concept. 
---
If I were to say, "I would never claim that I attempted to have sex with a puma" but only bolded *I attempted to have sex with a puma* it could alter the context of my statement. The rest of those words in your definition aren't just filler, they are important context.
---
This is not the case. By starting all or nothing you will be able to unlock that track. I have only entered Thunderhead peaks (Nothing else in the LWS4) and I have everything on the bond of faith track
---
That being said you are right, those skills are very nice
---
so, we can't use scrapper as a tank in raids? There is a trait that gives power for X amount of toughness. I just can't think of anything that will null dmg from damos if it needed.
---
If you target unused siege, you can see the timer and how long it has left. If some siege in an objective is low on time, it's worth checking the others too.
---
Is it gazelle ?
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock\_Instability:\_Birds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Birds)  
---
Birds make sound similiar to the one you described, but you would probably noticed the most hated instalibity in game. What tier of fractals do you usually run? Maybe on low tiers they are not that annoying.
---
&gt;Scrapper still has a niche in PvP.
---
As of today, scrapper has no competitive builds for PvP yet. Assuming gyros bring it back then yeah but that is a consequence of the recent rework.
---
The Blast Tag Gyro is quite a bit better for PvE.
---
Corona burst has a similar function (without sharing the might) and you don't have to slot anything for it. 
---
Though I gotta say it's indeed better than before.
---
Is it moa? 
---
&gt;It's lost to core warrior in dps for a long time now.
---
Got a source for that?, I was under the impression spellbreaker as pure DPS was still better than base warrior.
---
Soldiers gear was bad back between 2012-2014.  Soldiers gear is still bad.  The transmutation system was *the intended* way to apply different skins to different stats.
---
Nope, I started hearing it years ago.
---
Imagine if the game had a notoriety system.
---
I dont think staying abstinent of Expacs is a good idea for an mmo - but i dont think theyre absolutely necessary. 
---
Especially with the way GW2 is built. 
---
I think having a current Standard of Content delivered to potential Players, possibly in-between expansions, might offer a great way of gaining a target audience different than the People attractde by said expansions alone. 
---
No, it's not. Read the 1st rule.
---
Long-time lurker, but this needs a dev's eye, methinks. 
---
@ANET\_BenP
---
A week or two? More like a day or two. It has already plummeted compared to the previous two days.
---
I think that may be more the current WvW population than the mount. Especially after the nerf yesterday it'd not doing any significant damage.
---
Condi Scourge has been out of the meta for a really long time.  See it as an opportunity to revitalize your build!  Mix of cele/greiving is really good.  Or just full cele is ok and super tanky.
---
braham.
---
I still hate is whinny ass and the shit talking he'd done to us in past living world.
---
And yes im a norn and yes its ok for me if we dont have a racial main character in living world...
---
Everything you say is correct, if we assume Scrapper needs to be DPS.
---
But what if they made Scrapper a Tank/support candidate? What works well on Guardian is Support FB being good, but also DPS DH being good (and yes I know DPS FB is a thing but even so it is Condis DPS which doesnt actually step on DH toes.)
---
Heck even Chrono kind of had this/has this with Mirage being the go to for Condi DPS but Chrono being semi utility/DPS power based while also being a possible support in echo of it's forma meta.
---
It is possible to improve Scrapper in PvE without stepping on Holo's toes, you just have to be careful on what you change. 
---
your understanding of the premise of my reply is wrong.
---
yes, it's a running meme that wvw rarely gets attention, and it's often ill informed, nontheless are wvw players currently are the hot topic, which means there is potential that their pleas get heard, and that maybe finally some of the older issues get fixed. imagine being on hold on a support hotline for over a year, and finally getting through. of course people built up a backlog, got frustrated, and all of that bubbles up, which causes some of the reactions we are seeing right now - and they are anything but surprising honestly. ultimately though they are happy to have their turn now and a window of opportunity to draw attention to the fun to be had in the mode, as well as some seriously old issues that never really got addressed.
---
it's far from perfect, and people would still very much appreciate more effort in this regard. that doesn't mean they aren't glad about the attention they are getting for the moment however.
---
I understand, and have heard similar Things from other People. This is probably a part of the reason GW2 has this low representation in online discussion...
---
Personally firebrand is the favourite for me. Fun to play 
---
tbh i would likely consider it aswell... *if* the minimap had some proper orientation markers
---
The biggest issue with the LW format is how unexciting it is, and how it encourages 3 month long breaks with only a few feels of play time in the middle. As a new episode releases, players log on , get what they want out of the content, then lie dormant again. In a way it feels like a tease, and does little to generate mass excitement for the community. We know what to expect, we know about how long we can stretch the content,and when we've burnt  it out. We log off. LW is free. It hold player's attention very long at all. And it doesn't build the hype an expansion would. I think LW is an amazing bridge between expansions but in no way a replacement
---
They are probably talking it terms of group dps. While spellbreaker does outperform base warrior for personal damage, you have to give up EA to use it, which is a net loss for group dps. Since spellbreaker does not give group buffs and there are many better dps options than spellbreaker, you really only see it when boon removal is needed.
---
Well here lws1 weapon skins were the first skins skins. The scelerite, fused, jade dragon, southsun tribal skins and then the Halloween chainsaw GS, 1 handed sword, bat bow, staff, mad moon shield, and dismembered arm sceptre were all the weapons releases in that timeframe. The queens jubilee weapons sold in the festival square also are amongst them.
---
For armor u had the proto jetpack, Karka on face, tiki mask, fused gloves, scarlet shoulders, gloves, an helmet, the monocle, Karka shell shoulders, queens ball mask, u had the quaggan backpacks and tiger backpack. And finally you also had the witches hat for Halloween and the four winds hats and backpacks. You also had mad memories and a toy bag.
---
Super adventure box stuff was also all released at this time and the aether blades too. Though the toad king wasn't till later from SAB
---
The wings of the sunless were also released in lws1
---
Carrion or sinister are pretty good i believe. Vipers is the best but also the most expensive by far.
---
It's every bit as silly as predicted. Walls mean nothing. Fights are just ran away from. Finisher on engage skill is just silly. My suggestions:
---
- no stealth while mounted. Ever.
---
- remove the finisher from the engage skill.
---
- any hard cc dismounts you.
---
- being hit by an enemy's engage skill dismounts you (maybe allow your engage skill to complete if you already started it)
---
- fix the tower/keep exploits (yes I know this is a big task, but is vital)
---
The idea/intent is good, but there a few glaring issues to fix before I can consider it a net positive change
---
Thank you for pointing this out! I assumed the mastery tooltip was accurate. After some testing, entering any LS4 map (except Sandswept Isles, for some reason) unlocks it.
---
Hey, choyas are a cultured sentient specie and they shouldn't be slaughtered and eaten.
---
I mean, if we knew we are going vegetarian like this we should've started with Sylvari first. 
---
I think the Iboga chef is saying try this *rare* treat (not rade). I'll have to take a closer look at the orange text above, it it SO hard to read, I can't believe you got &gt;Hand plucked young choya T?R?S?? for succulent flavor.
---
Great job translating!
---
For open world PvE single target.
---
I understand what opinion you are trying to convey, but historically mounts were very effective weapons as well as transportation, especially after the invention of the stirrup.  While augmenting the abilities of the riders, horses were also trained to kick and bite.  War elephants were not just mobile platforms for artillery, but could crush enemies before them, and the fear on the other side was real.  
---
Anet has done a good job of providing each mount a unique ability to engage while not being too much.  I see this as another creative approach that is now being fine tuned.
---
engi rifle skill maybe?
---
I gotcha, this game has a decent feel of flexibility then. Thank you for the info, was very helpful.
---
Ok, I don't mean to be a condescending prick here, but are you even vaguely aware of the subject of the conversation we are having?
---
Commander, no
---
Yes
---
Here’s a great parallel for what I’m saying. For years a lot of the old school crowd was begging for the old stability to be restored. 
---
With mounts it has. Your first push cannot be CCed. That’s exactly how the old stab worked. Now you can save your books for after that first push.
---
And mounts will help you push harder into that Zerg, punishing the blob for not reacting quickly. 
---
I think that’s all really great. 
---
And to reiterate what others have said already in the previous threads:
---
WvW players have sent these exploits to the devs for *years*, and they haven't been fixed yet. I've personally found and known of ways to break into at least half of the structures since ~2014-2015 and only 2-3 of them have been fixed.
---
The more widespread the issue, the more it forces them to do something about it. 
---
Rules are often a general guideline, they can be broken sometimes.
---
&gt;  runescape to GW2 in 2013 because I had never before experienced the concept of dailies
---
Funnily enough, RS3 is *loaded* with dailies now.
---
The problem with that is though, not all of these exploits require the Warclaw. They need to fix the terrain, some of these have been around for a long time before mounts or gliding was a thing. The Warclaw just makes them easier. They need to fix the terrain. 
---
Hmm, so they have a Marketing folder at least  
---
0/10 I no longer have the time to autowalk my way back to tag while I go take a shit.
---
On a serious note: I dig it, getting around quickly is refreshing. I really feel like the maul ability should dismount whoever it hits though, even if it'll be evaded 99.9% of the time.
---
If you'd actually read my post, you'd see that the dying wasn't the issue, the *wasted time running* was. 
---
It is funny. That you decide to spend your time in a forum giving "Constructive Criticism" on a game that has "charts [that] show it's financially struggling". I want to see that chart and I want to see the constructive criticism that isn't strictly criticism and complaning for the sake of complanining
---
I'm not surprised, your attitude is really boring and unpleasant. Nobody wants to play with people like that.
---
I have to, becuse it's the only power ranged weapon for Mesmers...
---
lets hope that lady which was has mission to lock doors every night is still there.
---
What is ft2?
---
by the time you open your inventory and double click on it youre dead gg great counter
---
I was roaming with a small mounted group in enemy territory, and we were doing just fine as long as we stayed mounted. I mean, at worst, if you know you're going to get rolled over, port out as a group.
---
Likely for the same reason Renegade's garbage in PvP.
---
Content Marketing?
---
At HoT Launch, Engineer was amazing in PvE but so-so in PvP. As in, Engineer could get literally benchmark DPS (30k?) just by spamming bomb autoattack and toolbelts off cd.
---
So Scrapper was instead designed as a PvP spec to balance it out in those game modes. It began as a spec focused around CC and ranged stomps. Which actually made it OP for a long period of time until the "purity of purpose" update where they gutted Gyros ability to CC. After that, Scrapper became a more bulky supporter, still keeping the ranged stomps, more focused on defensive builds and superspeed. By the time PoF was released,  they reworked it again and Scrapper solidified itself as a healer in WvW which gave allies superspeed. This worked well because with PoF came the introduction of the Holosmith, so Engineer could have both its defensive spec and its offensive spec.
---
The point I'm getting at? Scrapper was never needed for PvE, so it was never a big deal, nor' was it ever a priority to adjust with that in mind.
---
You can think of Scrapper similar to Spellbreaker. It's not a PvE spec. It's a WvW/PvP spec. It may have uses in PvE for niche situations. But do not criticize its design with only PvE in mind.
---
tl;dr: Scrapper was never "bad". It was designed for other game modes, which it excelled at throughout its long history.
---
Anyone using Privateer runes?
---
I just think about the longterm implications of this mount in WvW months to a year from now.  If a new player or a returning player comes in and wants to do WvW, everyone who wanted a Warclaw would already have one and they as a new player would likely never be able to keep up with the zerg or just get killed 1-2 mins into an engagement and have to run back a long distance again.  It would be a frustrating and boring experience for these players, so it would be curious to see how Anet deals with this in the future.  
---
You're supposed to use emojis for reactions.
---
That didn't take long.
---
Is Deadeye an impossible class to deal with unless you're a specific class?
---
I was minding my own business with my new warclaw mount when some random knocked me off. I gave it a go throwing AoEs wherever I could for like three seconds and realized how it was going to go so I tried to run away, but I died. He kept shooting me at a distance, stealthing, appeared elsewhere and repeat.
---
Whoever you are, I hope you're proud of yourself for killing one rando newb.
---
Yea, and this is going to be a barrier of frustration later on for new players getting into the mode months to a year down the line.
---
I've been playing Heal Scrapper in my T4 static the past two nights, you can ez keep 25 might while overhealing and bringing tons of on demand stab for certain encounters. If you have a chrono w pack runes taking care of fury you are really in a good spot as the healer replacement for druid. You don't have spirits, but you can heal for way more.
---
Spellbreaker is a viable DPS option for warriors and depending on the fight can be a top tier damage option for the class. 
---
I like playing reaper with staff/GS. Viper/yassith's armor and weapons and either celestial or viper trinkets. The rotation of staff &gt; GS &gt; shroud and repeat gives no downtime, lots of burning, fear and chill. Though vipers works with most weapon combos for the necro so I never feel the class getting stale. You can also switch between base necro and scourge without swapping out an armor set.
---
and neither Tequatl killers nor roleplayers in Rata Sum (which according to you represent the majority of the community) are complaining about balance, so its fine.
---
&gt; but doesnt tag your kills for +xp or participation any more for some reason
---
That's because it the attack now finishes enemies before dealing damage. It was the other way around at release but that led to the same attack killing people and then finishing them immediately in one blow.
---
RIP Istan Farm
---
Flamethrower skill 2: Flame Blast. 
---
Still doing track. It's extra hard because there are no commies and when I tag up in being called a noob. Also being ganged by grievers on mounts is not nice, they attack anyone on foot and hunt players in packs.
---
Definitely after I get it I'm out of wvw for good.
---
Scrapper main here, I'm a big fan of what they have done to gyros.
---
I can keep 25 might while overhealing and giving superspeed or swiftness regularly with on demand stab for known CCs in T4s.
---
It has been my dream coming true and I can stop forcing myself to play druid.
---
Without knowing the details, I'll hazard a guess. 
---
GW2's engine, being a bit old, is poorly optimised for multi-core processors. 
---
One strong processor will usually run the game more smoothly than several weaker ones. 
---
When it was released, Anet expected that single cores would carry on getting more powerful, whereas actually it turned out to be more efficient usually to go multi-core and have several slightly weaker cores working in tandem. 
---
Yeah, but a holo can upkeep permanent superspeed as well - and it's way easier and it can be applied to an indefinite amount of people.
---
I get this look so much! She gets her own back by sitting on my partner at night when I actually want to give her pets
---
thank you 
---
its terrible.
---
roaming was already kinda dead and this kinda put the nail in the coffin. There's less engagement and fights happening now.
---
The addition is great if you just wanna just follow a zerg capture towers and keeps and farm pips. But for older vets who enjoyed the havoc groups, strategy and bag farming then this is yet another blow to that style of playing. The last few people in my guild has already uninstalled the game and I'm contemplating the same right now. I'm waiting for things to die down a bit and all the PvE'ers who are just here for the mount to leave and see how the meta changes.
---
&gt; If roaming was mostly ganking until now, then the playstyle has actually been dead for quite a while.
---
It was, and it wasn't. Ganking has always been a thing, but with Warclaws, it's much harder to kill people who are just trying to run back to their zerg.
---
Clear your cache, check your firewall, restart your computer and turn your router off and on again.
---
It's one of those things that just seems to happen sometimes. If that doesn't sort it, contact support. I find they're usually quite quick and very helpful. 
---
That worked well back then when they released the new episodes in every 2 weeks.
---
Worth noting that Firebrand mostly has very short duration conditions, like 4-6 seconds, so they burst as hard as a power spec. 
---
Is it shark ?
---
becasue vise versa theres are tons of weapons that underperform in pvp that are good in pve and theres no reason for anet to competely rework them so that they always perform well in both
---
As stated before me: context matters a lot.   
---
As far as Raids goes, literally every class has a condi spec that you can play in Raids. Some are meta on specific bosses, some are not, but all are playable. Just check the SnowCrows website [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/).  
---
As for Fractals: Power tends to be better than Condi in fractals because bosses have lower health and power is better to burst, in general.  
---
Condi is playable, though. If you dont get top DPS but you know your stuff and dont keep dying to mechanics, you are totally fine.  
---
Personally, I have the class that I like best and I have a condi and a power set. I switch back and forth, depending on whats better in the situation  
---
 I was very skeptical, but I have to admit I was wrong : Warclaw is a blast.
---
Both processors are quad core the main one being an i7 and the school one being an Intel Xeon E5
---
Though I checked and I noticed that the school computer (32GB) has twice the memory of my main computer (16GB) but memory doesnt always affect fps this way does it? 
---
I wish my computer was good enough to render these small bits and pieces of the game.
---
That's a good one, you almost had me right there.
---
Spellbreaker is hot garbage in PvE and drags every team he's in down. The only reason spellbreaker can even function in PvE is because core warrior trait lines are so incredibly strong they carry it.
---
Any spellbreaker build for PvE you have can be immediately improved by removing spellbreaker and replacing it with core.
---
but why run scrapper when literally tempest,scourge,renegade,firebrand are much better. Shit id take a boonthief over scrapper
---
&gt; Terrible for small scale or roamers. Difficult to dismount someone and disrupt reinforcements to s fight.
---
Are you talking about glass mesmers/thieves that stealth gank staff eles and zerg necros (with no ability to actually fight back with a build tailored to group play) on their way back to a fight? That's like shooting ducks in a barrel.
---
Hard to say...the raid guild ive been with since Spirit Vale first opened disbanded two weeks ago, and the 2 other groups ive been with quit the other night as well
---
Driver or not driver problem try these 2 steps , maybe fix it.
---
1) Delete the Guild Wars 2 folder here : C:\\Users\\(Insert Your Pc Name)\\AppData\\Roaming\\   (you'll need to insert user / pass again and set the video / audio preferences again)
---
2)  Run a repair : [https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client)
---
basically the gist of things is don't play core anything for wvw, tho some classes do allow wiggle room like staff ele and warrior
---
You can maintain them indefinitely with zero downtime.
---
For the same reason power revenant and reaper have been hot garbage as well.
---
At least you have a competitive power build and a competitive condition build. Necromancers have neither and revenants only had a condi spec that just got nerfed in a meta that favors power specs for more than 90% of the content in both fractals and raids.
---
Just practice responsible disclosure. PM it to the devs first, wait a few weeks, check if it still exists, and if it does then post it publicly so wvw commanders can decide whether to post a scout or guard at the exploit points.
---
They must have fired the man/woman who handled the social media accounts.
---
Well in pvp (only place I tested them) they're still pretty trash
---
It's unlikely to be down to the ram. 16gb is relatively high anyway for the average PC.

Check your graphics settings, set them at minimum and creep your way up until you find a compromise. GW2's FPS is known to scale a bit unpredictably with hardware due to how it handles certain tasks related to your CPU. 
---
If that doesn't work, check your drivers, check you haven't accidentally plugged your monitor into the inbuilt graphics and maybe contact support.

Just pink ward the spears.

Funny how people demand all specs (like renegade) be useful in pvp yet it's totally fine that some specs and even classes are completely confined to PvP (I'm looking at you, necro).

Harry! Damn, you always were a killer Deadeye. I just got back and it's terrible not having DJ be unlockable lol, Of the Ruined World here

I tend to not count the ones that have toes sticking out the side of the boots. It just feels lazy.

"How much longer do I have to grind for you, hooman?"

Fair enough

How about you talk about yourself and not for the rest of the people, other people might not agree what you think.

This is not Anet's official forum. Reddit is an independent platform that people share anything within the rules of it's subreddit. I know the mods of this subreddit are pretty active and if you post something breaking the rules, they will remove them in an instant. This is my general observation  on this subreddit and my first video is laying on the main page for 3 days.

It's a trap. The eyes say yes but the claws scream no

This is a cool post to see, as somebody who is currently considering a switch from WoW to GW2. I'd love some feedback on this switch from anyone who has done it/longtime GW2 players. As a longtime Wow player, multiple toons, regular Mythic+/Raiding, do you think GW2 will satisfy? Having played F2P in the starting zones etc I certainly can see the appeal in the game.
---
Hit me with your definitive reasons for why I should switch!

&gt;Exploits are abuse of game mechanics to gain advantage over others. These include buggy content: buying from a merchant to sell it back with profit, bugged skill interactions: druid staff blasting multiple times, and showing how to map break in PvP instances, dungeons, fractals and raids.
---
Map breaking has been specified to PvP, dungeons, fractals and raiding. It ostensibly lacks WvW from the list and therefor strongly hints at the idea that WvW is being exempt from the general ruling of map breaking. If you go to such detailed length to describe a rule, trying to be precise, then be precise about everything. If the goal is to not allow any conjecture, then they should explicitly add that this rule extends beyond the describes examples.
---
A rule is a rule. There are no exceptions to it. It either is or isn't.

&gt; oloed 75% of the Tormented Heart (or whatever it’s called) event chain in desolation.

Yeah I find that compared to the straight power builds, the mobility it has for survivability is great. Not to mention not having an interrupt during the dodge
---
I had a crush on Tybalt.

It stopped swapping with the latest update in the game. I downloaded the 3-5-2019 update to Build templates, and it worked again.
---
Doomsday Gang doesn't get partial credit for being 10% right for roughly 24 hours, when everybody who isn't a complete idiot knows that things like this almost always get patched and adjusted after introduction. For the majority of that time, most of the people playing didn't even *have* the mount, let alone have the time to figure out how to best abuse it. 
---
I played 12 hours of straight WvW that first day, and another 6ish hours yesterday before the ability got nerfed, and never *once* got stomped by a mount. Not one single time. And while I understand that everyone's experience will be different, and I'm sure lots of people *did* encounter this problem and that it actually *was* an issue (I certainly understand it was problematic and needed to be changed), it's ridiculous to pretend that this was all some kind of horrid catastrophe that signals the end of WvW forever (which is what the doomsayers were wailing about). It was a little more than a day's time when things were a little bit wild occasionally. That's it.
---
Criticism is totally fair, and adjustments are still needed because the Warclaw isn't perfect, but I'm not willing to give any credit to anyone who overreacts to something before even seeing it, let alone without even allowing time to tweak and tune the thing once they get to see it in large-scale action. ANet moved fast with that nerf, and they may change it even further. (I hope they do, in fact, because even though I really like it, it *is* a little silly that one guy on a mount can run circles around a small-midsize squad a few times before they can manage to dismount him.)
---
I agree, but no need to be patronizing.
---
She recently uploaded a guide of warclaw, what
---
What? Core engi was almost never "terrible" in PvP back then! It was meta in several forms, and perfectly acceptable most of the time even when it wasn't meta.
---
Scrapper brought a different playstyle that worked better in the post-HoT meta for several reasons, but to claim that its entire purpose was to fill a void that engineer never lacked in the first place is quite a stretch.
---
Don't forget their pet crab.  Crab Apple.
---
Works fine for me. 
---
About fucking time it has a purpose
---
*Oh no, they made the abilities functional!* 
---
They used to be good back in the days when you could trait them to be mobile though.
---
I'll try creating new utility skill templates, good idea.
---
Veil has always been a strategy to surprise people with. 
---
I’ve seen countless portal bombs wipe the other side because the veil line was on the other side of the portal. 
---
There may be some tweaks to be had, but I remain firm that they need to wait until everyone has had time to adjust and digest the new strategies. 
---
Note that the detect skill on the mount also shows hidden people. 
---
So there is a counter. Use the detect skill to avoid being surprised unpleasantly.

I dunno. Some Sylvari women seem like they've got delicious prickly melons.
---
Glass mesmers almost don't exist in wvw.  Did you mean condi mesmers?  Just dodge their burst and keep going.  They can't do shit to you if don't fight them.
---
Against thieves, if they're rifle, just keep going and dodge when you see the red light.  If they're dagger, don't turn your back on them when they're attacking you.  Turn and face them, and keep turning as they try to circle behind you.  Thief damage plummets when they can't get behind you.
---
If you're near water, try to bring them to it.  Both ele and necro (and just about everything else for that matter) beat thief in water combat, and there's no shortage of thieves dumb enough to try.
---
I play staff ele, and about 95% of the time I either win or make them run away and break combat to heal up.  The other 5% are PI thieves.  It is hard to beat interrupt spam without stab unless I can get them to water.
---
Overall not a fan of the way it was deployed and lack of QA on Anets part. The combat abilities, the dodge and mount health are too strong and really were not needed. And in 2 months what about new players or returning players they are just sol and left behind. 
---
The mount should be cc able, the stomping should be removed as should the engage damage and the mount health cut down along with the speed. 
---
I still strongly believe this should've been a movement mount with the ability unlocks allowing you to transport player(s) this making it inclusive to new and returning players down the road. 
---
In addition I had a great time in WoW with my mounts that could carry friends in WSG, AV and Ab and around the world. Imagine a new player zones in and you offer him a ride showing him things along the way, they would feel included and enjoy the experience. 
---
 Instead in a month or 2 new players and returning players will be excluded, leading to a frustrating experience as they cant keep up on foot in addition to not being able to run away they'll be chased down quickly and killed. Which in turn will be an unfun environment driving them from WvW before they even get the mount. 
---
I feel this was an opportunity to be inclusive and they missed it. Plus the combat abilities are to strong and some of the things like the speed and dodges along with stomping downs marginalizes certain class mechanics and are not needed. 
---
Anets short sightedness is disheartening but not unexpected. 
---
Except in wvw, there its guards and scrapper for support 
---
Their existence is terrible for low skilled player like me.
---
It's Kiyo, run, he's gonna kill you. 
---
I have the same question about revenant what a neglected class.
---
I'm curious to see this too.
---
I would actually have no problem with Scrapper and Holo filling the same role with the only difference being minor or cosmetics. The attacks have an entirely different "feel" to them -- so if I had the option to run Scrapper for raids instead, filling the same role as I do as a Holo, sometimes I absolutely *would*. It would be nice to be able to jump around with a hammer instead if I feel like it.
---
Having a defined role for the spec would be better though, I agree.
---
Delete guild wars. Restart computer. Shut off. Should be good. 
---
Staff 5 + 3 heals them for 2/3 of their hp so its easy to keep them alive as long as you are around. I started to precast them right before the fight so i can give boons straight away for chronos, That's the most annoying part. They should be made so the first cast comes with boons and cooldown together to save some time and do proper might rotation at the start of the fight. Stab from nature spirit is rip but it no longer dies when you ress somebody which is nice. So in some fights you might even want to use it at the start since it shouldn't die to to overlapping heals. It'd say it's a change for good.
---
Long after bunker meta was nerfed scrapper has not seen light in years. No pun intended
---
In all seriousness tho, celestial gear nerfed and.... Wait for it..... Blast on light finisher to get retal turned into condi cleanse. Good for teamfights but scrapper just lost a major part of dps. Almost perma retal against thief, dragon hunter, ele was a must. Now it's a dumb spec
---
Every game and game mode dies. Enjoy it while it's there.
---
You seem to have missed the part where they said "whiners" and "haters", too. Those also have an effect on things. And, regardless, having a ton of fanboys doesn't automatically mean ANet shares their vision for the class, or will cave to their wishes.
---
At least necro had a niche. It was always the solo king (and still is). Scrapper never even had that.
---
They added the helmet as a purchasable item from the warclaw vendor to fix it
---
"piken is currently full"

So this makes . . . what, 4 ways to skip past a garrison wall?  5?

I finished the track immediately before realizing I had to do other stuff first...
---
Charr female on the warclaw looks like a troll from WoW... pretty cool IMO
---
Dailies if you can, they are a small thing that still gets you AP and a little hit of gold. You're still progressing even if it's only for a very short while.
---
Mist forged armor in wvw also doesn't cost craft tokens. Where as both tiers do in pvp. Pvp isn't always on a league either.
---
This is a pretty big assumption. There's a guy in my guild who has a vision problem. He literally can't see the text window and the game play window at the same time. It's not that he doesn't care. He's incapable of reading and playing at the same time. 
---
There are people with all sorts of actual CAPABILITIES. It's easy for you to figure out what's going on. When people are out of their comfort zone, it's not so easy. It's not that they don't care...they don't know enough to know what they're supposed to do at all, including reading map chat, which is also a scrolling mess. 
---
Sure you're experienced and you can follow what's going on so you're a hero and no one else cares. Wrong. Some people do care and can't cope. And this sort of derogatory attitude only makes people not WANT to read map chat, or interact with WvWers.
---
Some people can learn eventually but they're not going to learn if they run into frustrated semi-abusive rhetoric that makes them feel like shit for PLAYING A GAME.
---
I feel it's okay for people to play a game without being good at it, or understanding what's needed. Particularly for people who haven't played a lot of MMOs, it's not so easy to know that you have to go to other sites and watch videos. So many just solo the open world and go where the achievement panel tells them to go and many of them have no idea.
---
That's why I spend so much of my time helping new people instead of blaming them. In many ways the game does a poor job of explaining itself. 
---
T.T i'm linked  with them 💔
---
now.... HOLD ON A SECOND WITH THAT FLAIR
---
Tfw you finally get perma superspeed on your scrapper but everyone's now on mounts.  You don't need to work as a team as much anymore to get your team around the map which makes it pretty dull. 
---
Why say that Scrapper will remain irrelevant?
---
I agree that it probably will, but that's also assuming that nothing ever changes about Scrapper... which is exactly what this post is trying to address. They could give it some more love, make some more adjustments, and make it viable at *something*. It doesn't have to be king DPS in order to have a role. Some changes here and there as well as the introduction of Diviner gear suddenly gave power Renegades a place in some comps despite their low DPS, after all. Give Scrapper some useful buffs and a few changes to make them viable alternatives for other roles, at least.  Why is it so hard to imagine ways that this could happen, when it has happened for other classes/specs along the way?
---
...where did you find that.
---
TBH I'm a little bothered that over half of these are holiday/ seasonal themed. 
---
But mounts scale with bodysize. You can have small charr and your mount will be actually smaller than big asura's one.
---
Is that the new 2000 gem skin?? How’d you unlock it so early!
---
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that most people won't recognize it as a natural name, because "Iget" is pretty obscure, and the "joke" name is super obvious.
---
I've seen some pretty funny keyfarm names over the years, though. There's one almost ever week that makes me laugh.
---
people need to stop playing glass builds and start building more defensively.  half the issue right now is too many down instantly on engage.
---
Wouldn't choking off reinforcements to a siege be considered sound strategy for taking the objective even if it results in shitty fights? Being from the uninvolved server I'll grant you is kinda dirty - but war is war is it not?
---
While I agree that pick/burst builds are different than roaming, I still see some value in it (to disrupt enemy reinforcements) on a conceptual level. How it actually plays out is pretty much awful because the people they're picking off have builds that are meant to be played in a large group and can't really handle a 1v1 or burst reliably.
---
The good thing about the Ballista stuff though is that they stick out and are easily identified (assuming you have name plates enabled). I haven't been targeted by one yet but I imagine you can evade frame the shots so that should help it be a bit more manageable.
---
Mobility is a tricky thing to balance in pvp, let alone in a game mode with huge maps and space for many styles of play (solo, small group, havoc/ktrain, zerg). I think that the mounts are more in favor of large scale group play, but I'm worried we won't have the population to sustain that in the long run.
---
Having Pounce dismount other players could be a way to address that I guess? Force both players to potentially dismount if it lands, forces the aggressor to dismount and lets the other escape if it whiffs/evades.
---
This, so much this.

1-2seconds of cripple is too much, lol

You haven't seen a dolphin with breasts, have you?

Yeah, I just doubt Anet will bring that back :/

Beautiful

It's fun and makes the game mode more mobile. Unfortunately, it also causes problems on the metagame level (detailed in many great posts on this sub) that need to be addressed or it'll become another sore point after the honeymoon period is over. 
---
I haven't asked them yet. 
---
&gt; Terrible for small scale or roamers
---
I understand the role of a roamer but lets not pretend the majority of them aren't a cancer. Their build is 100% tailored for 1v1 and mobility. Even if you somehow win they will *instantly* begin to run with insane mobility and get away. Anything that knocks roamers down is a win to me.
