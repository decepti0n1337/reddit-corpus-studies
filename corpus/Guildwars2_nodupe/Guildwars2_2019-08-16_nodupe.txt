Good to know. I belive you mean [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/31192/playing-guild-wars-2-on-linux-performance-optimizations-and-more). That is actually really handy, ty =)
---
Yes I play wvw - almost exclusively.

---
Yes I play a support role - Tempest auramancer to be precise, again, almost exlusively. 
---
My comment was in relation to the cost of marks, and what your post was entirely about. Nice goal post moving there buddy lol
---
It was an opinion, no matter how you spin it I am perfectly entitled to it and I am not directly or indirectly stopping anyone from playing whatever they want.
---
That is it.
---
I disagree, the signet of inspiration was a great change. Instead of making Chrono the de facto boon sharer where you just gave the chrono your boons ONCE then he would have to just up keep with itself in conjuction with Bountiful Disillusionment,
---
the new SOI is an enabler that enhances the boons of other classes. Chrono was primarily meant to just share Quickness and Alacrity, not all 13 boons. Keep this as it is.

Legendary backpacks are glider skins, but that's it afaik.

And yeah, besides maybe the heavy legendary set, the others are absolute trash. Medium armor specially.

Seems strange you have to be reported for names like this instead of it just being locked out...
---
Just like it is crazy they allow people to use the guild tag [KYS]... Talk about being obtuse with name policies.
---
If they made fractals any faster than they are, I'd totally want it to be a fractal instance. But since we only get one once every 7-8 months, I'd honestly rather a brand new theme.
---
GW2 is no free to play MMO. For a F2P such strategies would be ok, but not for a game for which you paid to play.
---
Dang. Is it a bad sign when you watch the video and then try to click on the chests to open them?

During Dragon Bash there was a female norn (near Raven or Snow Leopard Lodge I believe) that talked to a Son of Svanir that Jormag spoke to her and that the sons should be afraid of it...not sure if you can still find her there.

I'm playing on the same settings that I used on windows and frames are pretty similar. Probably around ~90% of the performance I had on windows. I didn't do any excessive testing though. Just a rough guess.
---
Don't have to pay monthly subscription, don't want to pay for skins(no one forced you for this), want more content release at faster rate.
---
Yeah the dev's should sell their kidneys, or everything they own, to pay for maintenance, server and other stuff to keep whiney people content.
---
u aint getting season 5 unless u buy expansion 3 lol
---
I'll give you a point for using the print screen button instead of your 10 year old cellphone!
---
Why do you dismiss focus so quickly for some classes, using only the argument that the skins are too similar to maces? They are recognizeably different. Guardian already sets a precedent for having access to both.
---
what are you smoking there, I want some to pass time
---
Similar, yes.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But guild wars also uses the angel/seraph style a fair bit on humanity stuff so yes, I'm not surprised to see something like that pop up.
---
inb4 the next expansion is season 5 just spread out over months with a lot more content than the previous seasons
---
btw if i made a thief my opener caracter i could still take him into pvp with no problem right?
---
Thx
---
Like a bag opener? 
---
Yeah, you don't actually gain levels in PvP, you gain tomes which can be exchanged for levels
---
So as long as you don't actively use the tomes, you won't level

Welcome, my friend, to the [Hungry Cat Scavenger Hunt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hungry_cat_scavenger_hunt). Starting back in 2016, they've added a bunch of cats with varying unlock challenges and difficulties. Some of them even do adorable things once unlocked!
---
&gt; As already mentioned, the content team and the gem store team are separate and don't draw resources from each other.
---
They all have the same boss who decided where to focus on.
---
And you buy a season pass?, I wouldn't mind that.
---
I wish I was this innocent so the incredibly annoying wait for the big announcement doesnt feel like cutting my toes with sandpaper
---
welcome dude
---
Oh yeah I’m dumb but not *that* dumb
---
Given the announcement, more likely to be either August 30th, or September 3rd. They already said that the announcement is about the Season 5 narrative - at least part of it is.
---
&gt;Although we can’t get into specifics about our upcoming Living World content (we’re saving that for  our streaming event on August 30)
---

&gt;We're  looking forward to sharing what we've been working on at the August 30  event, when we can be more specific in regards to what we say about  what's coming.

It may have no relevance to you, but it still show some interesting data like the total price for every cosmetic item vs a sub in a game with out a real money shop. Tho what I personally find interesting in these number are the total price for mount skin
---
r/guildrecruitment
---
Don't worry, it's okay, the important thing is that you know what it is now.
---
But if you log on once, it's free. Why bother with a season pass?
---
Or are you suggesting that because Season 5 would *actually* have expansion-level content like they proclaim for every season, that it'd not be free at initial launch?
---
I personally don't think Asura should ever look like the way \[TINY\] do. They look like loli candy monstrosities (to me). Don't mind my distaste for their fashion however, if they like it that's all that matters. Personally I like it when people's Asura don't have wings and fairy hair and go for a more subdued look. However, in doing so, no one stops to take a look at them because they don't stick out like crazy.
---
Why downvote cus i have profs?
---
... they're almost definitely not gonna release something before their big theater announcement.
---
I'm expecting the Aug. 27th anniversary stream to be some sort of retrospective, and then it'll contain some sort of story-related stinger for season 5. Then the stage presentation will be more explicit on story and features.
---
The part where I conjecture wildly is: I think season 5's launch will be somewhere between an expansion and a living world release. I still think having an anniversary livestream and renting out a theater for a typical LW patch is absurd. A tiny part of my brain thinks season 5's launch will be like 2 or 3 episodes at once.

I do dailies sometimes. But if the daily isn't level 100 I don't do it and I don't do dalies every day. I do them when others in my guild does them. The idea that I do everything in the game at times, except for raids (and I've even tried those) means I do  end game. Doesn't mean I only do end game or do what you consider end game mostly. It's like this whole idea that I have no end game because my end game is different from yours has become a thing in this reddit. And it's a bad thing.
---
I guarantee you there are more people playing my end game than raiding..or doing T4 fractals for that matter.
---
I don't remember if it was EBG, but people in chat were pretty convinced it wasn't the jumping exploit and rather a teleport.
---
Well I WvW with people. I PvP with people. I run Fractals with people. Are you having trouble getting a T4 Fractal group? It's not open world and people still do them every day. I just don't get this idea that because I focus on the open world means that people aren't doing other stuff. In fact, I know for a fact there are still people raiding in this game and finding groups for raids. Not sure what your point is.
---
pay no fucking attention to that shit, i been playing since gw1.  
---
people bitch about everything.
---
&gt;I guarantee
---
You can guarantee whatever you like. Raids being endgame is a very common and widespread convention for all current and past MMORPGs that had them.
---
Maybe for this game there's more endgame than just raids, maybe your casual approach is the "right endgame". I don't honestly care what you do, I care about the things I enjoy the same way you probably care about the things you enjoy.
---
In that sense I think discussing how the game is meant to be hyper casual or tryhard or anything in-between is pretty unnecessary. I'd expect a more defined path from the devs with the upcoming announcement.
---
The number of ppl using that without abusing it so much during the night time EU is raising :/
---
Sadly most ppl will just assume it's a latency issue.
---
That dude just made it obvious, I hope Anet really does something before it starts spreading more.
---
Raids being end game are very common in the MMO genre. So is raising the level cap with every single expansion and introducing a new tier of gear with every single expansion. This game was not sold initially on raids being the end game content, so saying that it's the defacto end game content is just silly. It's not for this game. It's one thing to do among many other things to do. End game is literally what you do after you hit max level and finish the story. That's all it's ever been. Even in other games that having raiding, very often the bulk of the community isn't raiders. But raiders don't want to accept that.
---
This game was sold on a different premise no matter what happens in other games. I'm using the reference points from this game. Sure raids are end game, but they're not the ONLY PvE end game.
---
And I get that you want what you want...which is fine. But it doesn't make you some kind of majority. People keep talking about vets as in all vets fit in the same box. This is simply not the case.
---
&gt;Nothing I have said invalidates your complaints.
---
Excuse me sir, what am I complaining about?, please quote me if you don't mind.
---
Wow, that teleport at :36. That's pretty blatant hacking right there.
---
I'm not unhappy that you're happy with the game, I'm unhappy that me and many, many of my friends don't play together anymore because the game has been on a negative slide for several years now. Is it still a good game? Yes, of course! But if the game's life cycle isn't drastically shaken up within the next 6-12 months, then it's unlikely that the grayness of my friend's list will become greener anytime soon. I'm definitely not alone in thinking this, hence the recent angst surrounding the game. You may feel great in ignoring the cliff that Anet have been dragging the game toward, but don't be surprised if you end up being a disillusioned fan like myself in a couple of years, wondering where it all went south.
---
Nothing I've said invalidates ANYONE's complaints. One might say view your comment about few updates as a complaint, at least by implication at very least.
---
I am on Opensuse Leap 15.1. I am using Lutris and D9VK via the Lutris install script. Nvidia 1060 gtx. I get far more FPS than my monitor will use on max settings.  
---
Works completely perfect and identical to Windows.
---
Eh, that's an abysm closing stretch.
---
And you shouldn't be surprised if I'm not that disillusioned fan. My friend's list isn't particularly worse off that it was two years ago. In fact some of the people on it are the same people that were on two years ago. 
---
Every single year, my guild slows down in the summer. Been going on for years. The first year, I was worried. The second year I was worried. By the fifth year I figure out the ebbs and flows and realized that people come and go all the time. So no I'm not stressing about it. 
---
You're still making it sound like there's this vast issue. You use imagery like a clif that Anet is dragging the game toward. It's just your perception. It's not invalid, nor is my statement that the game is pretty much exactly where most seven year old MMOs are. 
---
More people have stopped playing WoW than have ever played this game, but people aren't saying WOW is dead or dying or being dragged toward a cliff. It's all about a bit of perspective.
---
And that's all I'm doing here. Giving a different perspective.
---
upvote whore
---
There's no way they release something before the announcement.
---
The same day, maybe even directly after? Sure, why not.
---
Before? Absolutely not, what would be th epoint?

yup

Silver is *not* effortless for pugs. The vast majority of maps do bronze every single time. Literally the *only* time I see silver is when people are organized and trying for gold and then just don't quite make it.
---
Second, it's not about the rewards for finishing each. It's time. Gold is finishing much, much faster than a bronze effort, and therefore you're finishing a lot more blitzes.
---
Lastly... don't you think it's a little bit hypocritical to criticize how much time OP spent caring about something that doesn't net them better rewards *by wasting the time to type up a reddit post that gets you zero rewards and benefits absolutely no one (including yourself) in any way*? Honestly, if you're going to be talking smack about how other people spend their time, you should probably stop and consider how you're choosing to spend your own time. 
---
If you aren't interested in getting gold in Boss Blitz, that's totally fine and cool. There are tons of maps where you can just phone it in. But why do you feel the need to complain about people who want to put in the effort? Maybe this is fun to them. Maybe it's not all about the rewards for them. Maybe they just enjoy organizing things or trying their best at something? Why can't you just go do the things that you enjoy, and let other people enjoy what they enjoy?
---
Press M to open the map, then scroll over to one of the newbie zones and pick a waypoint in them to travel there.
---
If you're in the Crown Pavilion, you'll need to scroll the map layer up a level to be able to see the waypoints.  From the Labyrinthine Cliffs, you should be able to just scroll the map freely.
---
I don't want to get into any arguments one way or the other but I have to ask, why did you take a picture of your laptop? You could have just taken a screenshot...
---
waypoints would be the easiest, if you open your map with M, then zoom out with the scroll wheel on your mouse, you can find lions arch , north west of the zone your in and tele out, or if our in the pavillion you can go out the door on one of the sides of the arena, which will take you to divinitys reach
---
I think elementalist won’t get greatsword because they already have a greatsword via fgs; it’s convention that they don’t give ele weapons it has as conjures. Personally I’m hoping for pistols.
---
If your in Venezuela I'm guessing there is a decent chance you don't have a lot of spare money?  At least in terms of hours of entertainment per dollar, gw2 is really good.
---
However, I'm also one of those vets who thinks the game is dying.  It all depends on what you like.  I like raids every week with my static. The problem is what to do in game outside of those hours.  And bad pve balance.  But open world pve? If thats all you want, you will probably get a lot of good hours out of gw2.  
---
I will recommend you player power necro (and ultimately unlock the reaper elite spec and run that).  In open world pve power reaper is so much stronger than nearly all other options that I can't stand open world content with any other class now.
---
It is.  Its the same hack people have been using for years and is literally the first one you see when you look up GW2 hacks.  Anet has done a good job keeping them out of the game overall but there are some people that will go on streaks for months at a time and I have no idea why it takes Anet so long to catch those.
---
The legs end about halfway up the thighs and there's nothing between that and the waist. So no underwear to look at.

How do I know? Standing next to a player wearing the outfit and angling my camera to see through the dress.
---
It was for, uh, science.
---
Thanks but I'll have to pass. I have no problem starting raids if I want. That's not an issue for me. I'm not sad that I'm not doing them and I have plenty in game to keep me busy.
---
I'm a full time carer for a disabled person and sometimes have to leave the keyboard at a moment's notice. Raids aren't a good fit for my lifestyle. 
---
I've tried the Veil Guardian and a bit of Kairn and my guild has done the escort a bunch of times, but it's really not my favorite content.
---
Holy shit this version made my game way smoother. 65+ fps on Boss Blitz. Everything on High, shadows on Low, model limit Lowest.
---
I think it is still possible for ele to get greatsword.
---
Entropy is going to do its thing no matter what God people pray to. Consensus is temporary.
---
Despite I'm veteran I noticed something was wrong that you can't directly exist crown pavillion. However your new player eyes just explained what was wrong, it is not intuitive. Hopefully Anet reads and do something about it.
---
Draw my charr too my friend Makarow :3

plz don't support loot boxes
---
First of all, plenty of people have trouble playing in Heart of Thorns and even path of fire. What one guy finds challenging another could find easy. That's end game for those people. HoT open world stuff is absolutely a form of end game content. So is the mastery hunt. So is Dragon Stand and the TD meta. So is Triple Trouble. They're end game content.
---
End game content doesn't have to equate to challenging. It's what you do at max level. 
---
I've made 24 legendary weapons, 2 legendary trinkets and 2 legendary backpacks so far. Some people would consider that end game.

---
They can make money whilst still providing some skins as ingame rewards AND fixing ingame skins when they're clearly broken.
---
Welcome to the game and enjoy your stay.  You've got a lot of good content ahead of you to experience, it's a great game and people saying that it isn't are probably trolls. In terms of veteran player perspective, Veterans are either leaving or going on hiatus until the 30th(like me). While other veterans will  continue to play as usual. There's a middle ground though veterans sit at, you have your casuals vets, then you have your dedicated vets, and then there's the hardcore vets. The ones making the most noise atm are dedicated and hardcore vets, because they've stuck around the longest doing all the content and for the most part already cleared a lot of their worthwhile goals they've set to clear, and the content they care about has a bad release schedule.   
---
One fractal every 6 months, and a new raid every 9 months, another part of fractals issues are for a system that replaced the old dungeon system, it hasn't updated its list of rewards in a long time nor has it added anything new to spend relics on, no new skins or anything fun or useful of the sort. Spvp is only good for rewards, and hasn't been updated or given any proper love to make to make it really shine. Only these memes where they'll release a 2v2 map, without a 2v2 queue, basically DoA because hotjoins and customs are a wasteland. Don't believe me? Go look up how many people are playing in a custom arena right now . WvW has been falling apart for years, and the alliance system still has no drop date despite people waiting since last year and WvWers are losing hope it'll come anytime soon. No GvG or anything of the sort either.  
---
The real message: Veterans love this game and think it can be the best MMO out there and so much more, but it's squandering its potential and that's what's upsetting people. We can only hope whatever anet unveils on the 30th blows us away and invigorate everyone with big hype.
---
Yeah that won't work. Half the whiners will continue to whine that how the collection skins suck compared to gemstore skins like they do for weapon and armour skins introduced in collection and then with one skin introduced with collection they will keep wanting more every time. Nope I think it's better off.
---
Base game is effectively a trial at this point with the amount of  content added since. It is disingenuous to say the game is f2p.
---
Enjoy!
---
That's because most players in WvW have graphic settings on minimum and his clothing was replaced to default necro clothings. Should you increase the graphics you will be able to see the true fashion.
---
What is wrong with you that you think it is OK to have rewards in the gem store with no ingame equivalent reward at all and that gambling boxes are OK.
---
You *can* exit the Crown Pavilion!  :D
---
There's an exit at the southern end of the map, on the mid level. There's a little exit icon on the map, showing its location.
---
I do daily fractals most days and I've still only gotten one box. Idk how you did this.
---
Well, you can. Sort of.
---
Keys can drop as rng and then you can get mounts and gliders.
---
Glaze Joko!
---
Probably because you're mis-applying the rule.
---
&gt; There are tons of in game rewards. You may not like them, but they're there.
---
There are no mount skin rewards beyond the base skins.
---
Fun fact: GW2 is 7 years old and has been declared dead since S1 started with fixing signs over six years ago.

There is a reason why ded gaem is a meme.

---
I also ditched Windows a couple of months ago to play GW2 under Linux.  
---
I've got some different settings to your guide though (however I haven't added arcdps).
---
My wine version is "lutris-vkchildwindow-4.12.1-x86\_64", I enable DXVK and the version I am using is d9vk-6b125834.  Esync is enabled.
---
I had to select "Disable desktop effects" in the System options as well.
---
To save a lot of time, I copied over my Windows GW2 file and that worked fine.
---
Finally, for the other person out there that might running GW2 on Gentoo :) , I found some interesting problems with nvidia libs, mesa and gles.  The mesa install is overwriting files and clobbering some of the nvidia files.  You'll know if this is happening if GW2 doesn't work, and/or GW2 works but is super slow.
---
My current fixes are (after rebuilds of mesa, etc) :
---
ln -fs /usr/lib64/opengl/nvidia/lib/libGL.so.1.7.0 /usr/lib64/libGL.so.1
---
ln -fs /usr/lib64/opengl/nvidia/lib/libGLESv2\_nvidia.so.430.34 /usr/lib64/libGLESv2.so.2
---
The latter obviously needs the correct nvidia driver version.  Also, that change may not necessarily be 100% needed - still testing.
---
How the hell did that work with stances ?

Hmm if he has trouble surviving in full zerks, try using some marauder pieces for more hp. Ive seen wvw staff weavers sometimes use full marauder as it also has higher crit chance, so it wont become totally useless. Other set i recommend is full cele d/x or s/x, more survivability, less dmg, usually also used as wvw roamer.
---
Im just recommending sets with more survivabiloty that will also see some use in other parts of the game, as end game pve is all about zerk+assassin, or viper as condi.
---
Pve talk. Staff weaver is like the ultimate caster of gw2. The amount AoE is bonkers. Really great for HoT metas for example because you cleave ao many mobs at a distance. But solo play wise, it's too slow, lacks mobility, lacks burst on individual small targets. You wouldn't really use staff in raids fractals either (you could on some big hitbox bosses but still worse than sword). Problem in orginized groups for staff weaver is complexity. You pretty much have to memorize, or in pug scenerios, learn to have a feeling of how long it's optimal to stay in fire. Once you pop all your aoe, you're stuck autocasting fireball. The knowledge of timing is important but lucklily (tho this only adds upon the complexity) you substitute some downtime with conjure weapons. Just to add as a gripe, I always wanted so eles conjures would be flip over skills or ammo based, so they don't drop on the ground for others to steal because they really are important for your dps....BUT that's all irrelevant if you care more being viable rather than optimal. I listed the staff pros, they are good- distance, cleave, thematically cool, but also without conjures, pretty easy to play.
---
Honestly I REALLY loved WvW for years, and I started to see stuff like this more and more. I got tired of feeling like my side was losing because of people using stuff like this and my side just all out quitting when they saw it.

I experienced a similar situation it started about 3 months ago, it went from working perfectly to not working at all... it ended up being the Razer software. Synapse works, but any of the other razer software add ons I had to remove, and now arcdps works fine for me!
---
Oh im sorry, i mustve forgotten ATs exist. Pretty sure you dont need to have anything above level 2 to do them. Monthly, sure you need to do daily ones to be able to, doesnt change the fact you full unlock pvp at level 2.
---
Amazing work! This improved my performance hugely.
---
Thanks I’ll check that out
---
1. No. The passes are basically a slight prestige/convenience thing. 
---
2. The game is very different to WoW so it's hard to compare directly. The combat style is very different with more focus on actively dodging and blocking than WoW. They're both string choices, so crack on in up to about level 20 and see how you feel from there. 
---
3. Metabattle is best all-round build site. 
---
One thing to warn you of is that WoW is very guided, whereas GW2 is.. not. Use the heart quests to kind of guild you around but don't treat them as mandatory. Events are really cool usually, so look for nearby orange markings on your map. Dungeons are encountered as part of zones, fractals are more like Dungeon Finder dungeons. Focus on gear with Power as a stat while levelling. It's impossible to ruin your build while levelling so unlock things in whatever order you like. Hmm... gear is hugely important, but exotic tier is fine for almost everything. Have fun!
---
Lmao yall are so gullible I swear, this is clearly a shitpost.
---
You can't even enter ranked until your'e a certain level, at least the first time. If you're talking about you can PvP on a level 2 character after you've leveled one, you're right. It's still end game.
---
Noooo they are asking me to delete my 6 year old level 80 Ele. Not the Thief. The Thief is still level 2
---
See above
---
Not saying I am not. But i would have accepted it more if they replied to me “no refund” then “lets delete ur 6 year old main”
---
Here's the issue
---
Not only is the subreddit not support, you literally did this to yourself, there's literally no reason to even post this
---
You went through 3 seperate obvious prompts and confirmed each one on the wrong character
---
Support literally does not have the tools to refund an item that changes your account data without deleting any gains from that character
---
There's no other thing to discuss or say, move on and learn from the mistake
---
Reddit is not support. You pulled a big time idiot move. Try to work with support (not everyone gives you cookie cutter responses) and maybe they can fix your colossal fuck up for you.
---
&gt; Mesmers... after the last round of chronomancer irritation I just gave up on the class. There's certainly nothing else like them elsewhere, but they're very obnoxious to play unless you go Mirage, so I wouldn't recommend those as a starter class.
---
To counter this, I found mesmers really intuitive and struggled with the flow of combat on mirage. Magic tank with decoys is something I found very safe and easy to use.
---
Again, my main issue is not with them not refunding me if they came out and just say that. Its with asking me to delete my 6 year old main. If they said “tough luck” i would not have made this thread.
---
Seens like a pretty standard procedure in order to get a refund. You fucked up through several "confirm" checkboxes, if they can't just ask you to delete the itens there's probably a reason for that.
---
EU Mapchats are imho pretty active, sometimes hyperactive so i turn it off ;-)
---
wow, few more years and you should get print screen buttons in venezuela too!
---
If you want to have fun and play casually then there's ranked queues and a few maps and a few set builds for each class to play with their own roles in the Conquest game mode. I guess the best way to know if you enjoy it is to play it.
---
The only warning is if you expect an eSports level or highly competitive PvP scene. You might get queued into some unevenly matched games (by virtue of the relatively small population), and getting into the leaderboards for the ranked season is not very prestigious (as there aren't that many players playing so if you try reasonably hard you can get pretty high up there). For most average players it'll be fine though, just maybe a bit repetitive and annoying (damn teammates!).
---
Lol wvw maybe, pvp is a broken unmonitored mess and has been for years
---
Hang on.
---
You purchased a boost and it worked.
---
And then you decided to refund it.
---
Why?
---
&gt; ...he's pretty against using meta builds to define his play style.
---
Give him a build you came up with and ask him to try it out. He doesnt need to know you pulled it from metabattle or someone else linked you to a build editor that is a cut and paste from metabattle. Meta is a good place to start with learning what does what for dps on any class.
---
But I used it on a level 80. Why is the item even usable on a level 80? Isn’t that equally as stupid as what I did? I know it’s a dumb move but asking if I want to delete my level 6 year old main, ?? That’s not a nice customer service response. They should then just have the balls to tell me hey you fucked up no refund
---
The ultimate plan. Start a feud between raiders and PvPers and get them to attack each other while I sit here, grinning maniacally behind my monitor, watching my evil plan come to fruition.
---
I used it on my level 80 ele
---
Yeah, level 20 in pvp. Can still do everything from a level 2 character. But sure, if you wanna call ranked PvP end game go ahead. End game on a level 2 character who hasnt finished the story. All the ascended and legendary gear you grind for definitely goes to use there for sure. PvP is definitely the end game after the story though. Gotta finish everything in the game so you can go into PvP with free runes and sigils and an amulet. You had a better argument for HoT open world being end game than PvP. At least there you have some semblance of gear grind.
---
[You're at the very bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)
---
I'd like to see a group of level 2 guys jump in and win some tournaments. It's not about when you can enter, it's the skill you need to succeed. By your definition if I went into a raid on a level 2 character with 9 guys carrying me, and I won, I was playing end game content.
---
But how would they know it's your six year old main? What if you accidentally used it in a character you didn't care about? They laid out the options for you and asked wether the terms are acceptable. To you they are not, to someone else they might be. Why is something to get your knickers in such a twist you had to make this thread?
---
Benchmarks don't always stress the system the same as other loads can. As power supplies age, their ability to deliver power slowly drops. So maybe it's more of not being able to meet demands under heavy load. 
---
Windows 10 refresh might help. Should save some of the trouble of a full reinstall of everything.
---
Omg is my OP really so unclear?
---
There is two characters. A level 80 main ele that’s 6 years old. A level 2 thief I just made, level 2 cuz the tutorial gives it 1 level.
---
I opened the boost on my level 80
---
You can make many objective observations about aspects of the game showing that its not in as good a state as in the past.
---
A shared inventory slot bought seperately is way cheaper.
---
They are not because Veterans are the ones who play since release. You can't reach the same lvl as a veteran alone because the AP.
---
Because they can see my account history and all the LS seasons episodes I completed with it? 
---
How did I get all my achievment points?
---
In another game I messed up similarly (the only difference was the item was available not only in game store, but as extremely rare loot and I got it that way) and I did not even think about refunding, it was just my fault and in 99% games you do not have option to get refunded for stupidity.
---
"Relentlessly Pursues Targets", "Creates Clones", that is just perfect fit :-D
---
That’s fair, but what I am arguing is them asking to delete a 6 year old character that has thousands of hours played on it.
---
Only in gw2 the opinion of a newcomer is worth so much more than that of veterans. Only in gw2 the general playerbase seems to think they somehow know more about the game or are more important.
---
Well I haven't touched fractals in a while, but that's what I meant. I spent the better part of two years doing fractals nearly daily. I was doing t4 for about a year before I finished the back piece. Still haven't seen a box of gear drop.
---
&gt; They should then just have the balls to tell me hey you fucked up no refund
---
Then you would be here about them telling you to "fuck off no refunds to idiots sry"
---
Honestly, as a dagger/dagger ele I was hellbent on never sacrificing my precious babies regardless of any highfalutin elite spec.
---
But sword is so, undeniably fun. Every 2 skill becomes a leap finisher or dodge, every 3 skill does preposterous damage. I keep my dagger for nostalgia, but...I haven't really swapped weapons since. While staff is more than acceptable in any overworld content, I'd urge you to try sword at least once. It's a really fluid, active take on the class.
---
Yeah, since you literally asked for "how to get boost back" they find it the only way to give you boost back so they told you it.
---
...is it your autoattack chain?
---
Yeah, first year of WvW was amazing. Then the hacking along with the orb flying hacking and it's just not fun. Sadly these teleport hacks are very easy to find out there and I've seen them used in wvw and spvp so often I just quit that part of the game early on.
---
I probably would have been less mad and never made the thread
---
He posted in this sub 2 years ago about huntsman and leatherworking combinations so yeah no, he did not just install it for the first time. Whatever, the absolute state this shit sub is in.
---
His goal is getting attunement 1 not farming gold. 30 relics / day is 10k in a year.. I'm just answering the question..
---
Preach itttttt. Especially the last sentence, and especially for wvw mode
---
carpenter
---
Seeing as he's been on this subreddit for two years already im not sure he has is going to take your advice.
---
I think we'll get a nice teaser trailer for season 5 at Aug.30 and then have to wait an other 2 weeks for release :D
---
I see, you're ready for christmas... As the overely decorated tree. :)
---
With some things for sure.
---
The only technical option that would work for you would be full account rollback predating the usage of lvl 80 boost, however you don't know when the last "checkpoint" for rollback has been made.
---
Anyway, with your attitude you deserve nothing.
---
I will ask them when this was
---
Is that league on your desktop?
---
I've been studying abroad since July 7th. I haven't been able to play at all and I totally miss it. I come home Sunday!
---
Na its not dying, im new too and low levels are filled with other players. Its fun!
---
Gandara Moon Fortress Lounge Pass, 800 gems
---
No, generally sifting through account data like that is nowhere as easy as you think it is.
---
That's not even dolphin level. Whales are laughthing at those small change.
---
Side note, lets add? We cn help each out exploring!
---
Hey, i hope your enjoying the game, and if you have any questions you can PM me. BUT HAHAHAHAHA THATS FUCKING HILARIOUS
---
Wow buddy! i'm from Venezuela too! Maybe we could play together sometime :D
---
Not losing features or content =! objectively in a better state than before. Especially a multiplayer game, where playerbase is of the utmost importance. 
---
But if you want some objective facts you're conveniently ignoring about PvP: Queuetimes are objectively longer as well for example. The amount of gamemodes playable in normal queues is objectively smaller as well (no deathmatch anymore). Time between patches has objectively gone up. The number of maps released has objectively gone down. Automated tournaments are objectively very often wintraded.

(just look at the prices...)
---
We’ll I’ll just see what her reply will be. I’ll fight for either another 80 boost or 2000 gems tooth and nail but if they don’t give it then at least I tried.
---
If you have thousands of hours played, you really should have at least a couple stacks of tomes hanging around. Why would you even need the boost?
---
You just installed it despite being active on this reddit talking about the game since like a year ago?
---
Hmm ye might be worth it 😂
---
That fabled "mmo with infinite content" do not actually exist. You run out of content with every game eventually.
---
EU is still somewhat active. If you're on NA then... 6 days out of 7 are slow days.
---
STOP DUPING ARMBRACES
---
Even back in the day I bought an intel laptop for gaming, and I got a cheap amd for work. The intel was supposed to beat the amd... but that was in ideal conditions. Unless the single thread difference is big go for cores within similar speeds.
---
Go to sleep.
---
Sure. If you are on EU pn me :)
---
Just turn off your brain bro, lol
---
But it's not pointless suggesting. To you the suggestion is unacceptable. Other people play this game, and to someone else it might be an acceptable way to proceed. CS can't possibly know in which camp you are, they can't read minds. They are also not going to gamble with guessing customer wishes, which is why they're asking.
---
He's been here a while, look at his post history lol
---
have fun
---
I do yes but it does not have the preview option.
---
I played many characters all my time on GW2 but never at  max level. I was an ele main for all of it. This level boost allows you to basically preview and test the class at level 80 to see if you want to do it. With Tomes they are gone when you use it.
---
At the same time it comes with lots of bundle items to get you started. I was also going to buy a waypoint unlock package along with it once I made my choice permanent.
---
I can still use the tomes now of course but I will essentially be paying double the cost.
---
I can’t imagine there is even one person that plays this game that would agree to deleting a character they played exclusively for years, just so they can level up a level 2 character that has nothing achieved or unlocked.
---
Please speak for yourself, not for "us veterans"..
---
Veterans are always leaving. Everyone gets tired at some point. That doesn't mean the game is dying.
---
so the state of pvp is objectively worse | given how players are used to experiencing it, fine. i dont play pvp. has it lost content? when you say deathmatch not being a thing, do u mean its no longer available or nobody plays it?  i cant check myself right now.
---
when i say that objectively the game is in the best state its ever been, i say that because Anet has finally got their shit together and shifted their focus back to one thing: GW2, and that they have consistently added ***content*** (not gemstore stuff or something equally useless) that meet the metrics they have for what will improve their game. to players like me, the warclaw was perfect for wvw because i can finally get back to the fights using an established mechanic that i can even upgrade as time goes on, and i dont even have the warclaw yet, but im excited to get it for those reasons. 
---
if pvp hasnt actually lost anything other than a decrease in the variables that the playerbase provide for it and thus have the most influence over the metrics of, then yes you can make the argument that it has objectively gotten worse to play from that perspective, but like i said, objective has one definition, so maybe its actually the wrong way to describe pvp, because i agree, it really has been treated like shit by Anet and i agree that its not fair
---
I think you miss the point what being a veteran means.
---
I presume you mean scepter not mace. Scepter is categorically the "magical mace" and that's clearly seen \*through\* guardian. The scepter is a ranged conjuring weapon while the mace smashes things. In fact, all scepters are ranged. Does this mean the precedent cannot be broken? Technically no but a scepter that is melee is just a beat stick which mechanically is no different than a mace or blunt weapon in effect. And in that manner, it therefore must be a magical based attack. 
---
They are different but in such a minor manner. Additionally if you want to sell fashion wars, you'll want to offer weapons that are more commonly used so that players will buy them with the intention and ability to spread the skin across other characters (example: sword is the weapon that all professions can use except necro at this point; and sword is also a fairly common gemstore weapon skin)
---
came back to the game after a 5 years break - playing since 3 months again and I’m LOVING it! Welcome to this awesome community lad
---
Huh. Guess there isnt end game at all in this. No wonder its bleeding people who play anything but open world.
---
Same.
---
And even GW1 isn't dead.
---
Still has a very active community, and I'm so glad it still exists!
---
In 2 weeks there is WOW classic, that is what he meant.
---
I recently went back to retail after 4 years, change of pace but I currently enjoy it more than GW2. Different people, different taste. 
---
Nonetheless, 30th will be the decider for many people if they stay or leave.
---
No, it's just that the constant whining from players, whose opinions are no more valuable than the large number of players quietly enjoying the game, gets as dull, boring and repetitive as they claim the game is.
---
Raiders not being veterans. Good one. 
---
They might as well be vets playing since launch since you did open world rp
---
Well all of those items are still there, I haven’t touched them, if I delete all of them and they remove 2 gold from my account then there is no harm done.
---
same
---
You can play every class and you wont reach that. The story, quests, dungeons, pvp are all the same.
---
A bit of (likely) useless lore: Ventari's a centaur. He and a human dude planted the Pale Tree (what is now The Grove) and Ventari put his tablet in it's roots. When the Pale Tree flourished, she used his teachings to give Sylvari a moral code based on them. 
---
So in a way, you *are* a Ventari, but morally, less so as a race xD
---
the best for someone with under a few hundred hours, sure
---
Won’t happen
---
Hey man! Just wanted to tell you I'm really, really greatful for the hours you've put into this!
---
I used to get huge fps drops and in general fps rates of around 40.
---
I installed your tool last night and I no longer have to live with those fps drops. They're basically completely gone!
---
Also it even boosted my fps in some places by 30 fps lol!
---
You're doing a great job, making GW2 more accessible to low budget gamers! Never had I so much fun flying my griffon through a stutter free world! Thank you so very much!
---
Players declare an MMO dead when they can't find people for content they want to do. But abandoned content is very common in MMOs.
---
No, if they do something like this it will be at the end of the announcement "hey btw folks, 1st episode is now live", but not before
---
Arent you supposed to be farming green dragons to feed your family?
---
&gt;If you’re just starting now
---
OP has been playing this game and posting on this subreddit for almost 3 years lmao
---
Can't believe people upvote this shit
---
Is your laptop able to run it
---
You may should say that to the CS, not to me. ;)
---
In NA the LFG for raids and fractals is a literal wasteland though. I wish it was like EU servers. An end-game focused guild is a must for the game as it is now.
---
People got to 100 on the second day after the release of HoT, if you still aren't there you prob havent done endgame.
---
&gt; I mean I get that I don’t post the whole story but I can’t possibly copy paste the whole chat chain here.
---
Making screenshots and posting the imgur album would be the easiest way. 
---
From what you wrote in your OP, it just sounds like you are a big idiot (sorry). I mean it's even hard to see that you used the boost on the wrong char.
---
How do you expect someone else to realize it was your 6 year old main when even you didn't realize it was your 6 year old main?
---
Salty
---
[This](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9y32xq/arp_stats_after_todays_8_matches/e9y6e86/) and the [account](https://old.reddit.com/user/Cloinville) that created that topic, so this is probably for drama.
---
Case closed, Watson.
---
with this logic,you can buy gems for gold and buy keys XD
---
Sub yes, but not the other things. And sub isn't even comparable here since GW2 doesn't have one.
---
No, you just wanted to seem like the good guy in all this. “I’m hardworker! Respect me!”
---
It's not a human, it's a charr so it would be Chewbacca wars 2.

"I just installed the game"
---
If you gonna fake praise the game, at least make new account to pretend like you didn't play before.
---
People who constantly praise the game as flawless and perfect and refusing to have a more nuanced opinion and acknowledge the game's issues are as dull, boring and repetitive. Just saying.
---
I'd guess it's so they don't have to have precise justifications for people that do stuff that toes the line.
---
Hey bud if your central / eastern us time I'm part of a raid primary guild but we accept anybody and are happy to play with you and help you learn the game through core tyria and onward! Shit can be chaotic but there's always folks trying to run map completion (including myself)!

Ps. Try formatting your post so it's readable.

Woah, that guy is a old known hacker. It's incredible he's still in the game.
---
&gt; didn't even know they were there
---
yeah, who goes to LA anyway?
---
I think he's talking about the PvP playerbase, not you.
---
There's a lot of rage in PvP. Even unranked. Don't expect many lost games that don't result in at least one person on your team raging out. Shit, I've seen wins that still have someone on the team rage.
---
It's not just PvP. It's every mode except for open world.
---
Well, *that* was a bit salty I gues. ;)
---
However, I talked about the PvP scene, not about you. I answered your simple question. :D
---
To be fair to the wording used in the title, reading it in the right way it also reads like OP is a returning veteran.
---
I mean what's the difference between 97 and 100 really?
---
how do you know if he downvoted you
---
re-read my response, i think objectively is the wrong word to use to describe whats different now. subjectively, wvw and pvp are worse off for the playerbase because no one is incentivized to play them. once you understand why objectively they are in a better state than they were in the past, you will understand why anet doesnt feel the need to improve on them. im not saying its a good thing, im saying from a technical standpoint, and from the perspective of a company who made the decision to focus on pve expansion content after literal years of demanding they do so from the playerbase, there are legitimate reasons why things are the way they are right now, especially if its true that gw2 was being maintained by the equivalent of a life support team during season 4. if in 6 months nothing has changed about either game mode, then i will stand with your opinion that arenanet doesnt actually care about their game. ive defended it for a long time. they have a full staff working on it again. if they still cant do the right thing for this game with a full staff working on it again, then i will stand there next  to you with pitchforks lol
---
you can have f2p and b2p but that all depends on what you gonna do. 
---
you can be in 5 guilds max so you can keep your mule guilds if u have slots.

upgrades are pretty nice in the end tho take time and resources
---
I mean, it's very limited in scope.

If you add all the BLC rewards, including the weapons and stuff and even the account upgrades you look at insane numbers, several times of what I got here.

---
those veterans will come back when LS5 is released, you'll see, it happens every single time. They can whine all they want about gw2, it still is a very special game you can't forget so easily.
---
The problem is, what you call endgame, is a mostly a very casual, shallow and menial singleplayer experience that OTHER casual and singleplayer games do better for me. What GW2 actually does better than other games is it's exploration, horizontal progression (only expansions so this well, living story fails miserably), combat, meta events, instance designs, PvP and WvW.

I am actually ginna create the guild in two weaks when i come back from holidays,

This is a perfect example of why I won't pvp/wvw in this game.  What's the point?

Well if you farmed 20g per hour, 2 hours a day all year round for its 7 years lifetime you would have 100,000+ gold today anyway. Everything in the gemstore for free, woooooooooo.

Sorry, what do you mean?

Being at 100 would be a very expected minimum from someone calling themselves an endgame player doing fractals.

Except your venting is about your own stupidity, not support. Its petty and dumb. You made a mistake. This topic and you're venting is a waste of time.
---
Blurry phone cameras always work.

Tell him to use glyph of storms in earth, it can blind large groups of mobs and makes soloing them really easy. Also it's pretty easy to go full glass kamikaze with eles, since the downed lava font created by persisting flames trait in fire helps a lot with cleave when you go down. You can almost always trust on it to rally you if you're not fighting a bunch of veterans or elites.
---
Yup you had to get every other skill on his bar and then spam the shit out of capture hoping to get lucky on the quick ones.
---
complaints are never from a singlular point...
---
normally youtubers stir shit up, wooden potatoes is an exception but people need to realize. just because someone has 1,000 followers on a video that he is sharing hes opinion on something about the game does not make it your own opinion. lol
---
if 10 people want to change 10% of a part of the game, the game turns to shit. it always does, this is why i am against weebos trying to change something i like. let the devs do their job, its what they are paid for.

recently i saw a video about a youtuber complaining about the GEM store of all things... what the F@#!$ do you expect from a free to play game !?

guild wars 2 is doing a great job in my opinion and i will still play it.

heads up to the next reply, i stand on my comment and i will not dispute it.

I probably would have overlooked it yes. No where I argue that it isn’t stupid though. My first sentence to the support team was “I did something extremely foolish”

Venezuela Is in a bad situation, but not as much as the mediatic warfare makes it out to be.

But what's the difference? Is there a sudden difficulty jump between 98 and 99? I honestly don't know, I'm a WvW player, my fractal lvl is like 45.
---
Wow actually produces endgame content. Gw2 with adequate content that catered to mmo players instead of Facebook/mobile gamers could have gotten close to wows popularity. Instead we are now at a point where devs will try to milk as much money out of the players with as little investment possible until it dies while they work on a new mobile project or smt

Then they maybe can't undo what you did, so next time pay attention is my best advice ;o

it's an amusement park game I guess. Honestly at this point the online aspect is pretty meaningless and GW2 could be converted to a fun single player game....

---
Is it cheaper to buy a +9 agony resistance with fractal relics and gold or to craft it with an artificer?
---
Arenanet focuses hard on story and there might be few reasons for that. Tinfoil hat on. They want to rush story to finish gw2. They are ready to go to next game to escape old gw1 engine and spaghetti code. That's why we don't see much development in some areas and no focus on gameplay and mechanics. They just want to end story of gw2 and move on to their next game, whatever it may be.
---
As a veteran I can tell u that u don’t understand the outcry and the reason why people leave. Nothing in your post addressed the critical issues veteran players have with this game. This game is awesome for new players, casual players or people that play it as a side game. For long time players, players that look for a challenge or ppl that want to dedicate their life to this game it‘s not looking good. If u want to protect Anet now do it but posting this on reddit won’t change anything.

Hey, as a new player soloing a dungeon seems just crazy to me! From my little experience in dungeon's it feels like most mistakes in positioning or a slow reaction to a knockdown mechanic will instantly kill you. I also play a guardian but feel that once your health is low it gets really hard to recover, the F2 heals for very little and the main heal is a long  CD.  Do you play basic guardian or one of the elite classes? Also judging by your health i assume you are in full berserkers?
---
You can't.
---
how to take a screenshot 🙈
---
Not sure what you're talking about, I've got 5000 games played and seen maybe four actual hackers(hundreds of hackusations though), add another 10 in WvW (rank 2200). Hardly an epidemic. OP's hacker is a Scout (rank 20 - 30) so clearly a new account.
---
I guess the missing piece of info is that OP, being *sure* they loggen onto the newly created thief, used the boost and they claim the game somehow relogged them to their other level 80 character and applied the boost on that one.
---
if someone asks me if he should play the game and he wants to experience anything related to pvp, wvw, raids or dungeons / fractals i would tell him he should search another game because those gamemodes are dying out.  
---
if he just wants a casual experience playing some loot simulator with a bit of added story every few months...sure, go ahead.
---
it's just as flawed of a statement as saying "the game is doing great" or "is healthy". it's not. and i'd rather tell the captain we're capsizing so he notices a worrying and detrimental tilt in the ships lay that *will* have consequences, then assuring him that he mustn't worry and that everything is alright, which would inevitably end in him steering the the ship even faster to its demise.
---
I'm all ears for what i don't get about the argument that the game is dead/dying. Whoever is reading this, enlighten me!
---
o no there is alot of players :P you know who runs keys, they all have "key" or "running" in there names xD

How do you know that all those players in lv 1-10 maps aren't quitting by the time they reach lv 50? Or players who instantly boost don't quit within the month of playing? 
---
It's not uncommon for people to quit before they even see what game has to offer because they get bored meanwhile. Seeing a lot of players in low level maps means absolutely nothing.
---
Tell me how the game isn't dying when everything you can achieve is done the quickest and easiest by cashing in gems to gold? The game is a trashy mobile-type game now. You grind for around 2 € a hour ingame gold or you can just cash in your minimum wage mcdonalds extra hours to get "elite". The game doesn't reward skill, just whales. It's essentially for old people with terrible reaction time and hand eye coordination who want to feel "good" in game because all they need to do is cash in to be the biggest lightball of all.
---
you don't leave queensdale much, do you? the most apparent and easily observable would be wvw, where many server nowadays struggle to attract enough attention to form queues even during *reset*.
---
there have been enough topics with enough accurate elaborations over the last few months, i do not intend to regurgitate them all for you.
---
The last update for wvw was pips years ago (no warclaw wasn't a content update, 30 minutes into the patch everyone had it unlocked for our server)
---
The only relevant matchmaking for pvp which are tournament is broken for 2 months now and no fix is in the sight soon
---
Dungeons haven't been developed since pre-hot
---
Raids take 9-10 months to ship for 2 hours of content
---
Fractals take 6 months to ship for 10 minutes of content
---
Both latest raids and fractals are so easy that it make people interested in any sort of challenge disappointed and quit
---
Do i have to continue?
---
&gt;Last time I checked streams or asked people who play pvp, the queues were 5 minutes in the best scenario.
---
I play PvP almost every day. The average que is about 3 minutes.  
---
&gt; I also don't remember wvw having queues outside of 1 or 2 maps during weekly reset (unless you're on overstacked server which has double population of everyone else which also isn't very good indicator of healthy population). 
---
That, i can agree on. It's server dependent.  
---
&gt; I wouldn't necessarily call the game dying, but it's severely lacking updates for endgame content. What you're describing is amount of content players can do until they reach endgame (which is a lot of content), but the biggest complaints are about endgame itself. 
---
Again, agreed. But given how much content the game has to offer, you'd be silly to say it's dead. New players have TONS of content to go thru and it's such a damn shame they get turned away from the game by those who finished everything they wanted.  
---
&gt; No one says that the game isn't good for newcomers, it just sucks when you want to invest time into something, but you get slapped in your face instead because the content gets too stale too quickly. 
---
Again, that's down to veteran players being burned out from the game. Those who played 5 hours on average for the last 7 years are bound to lose interest. Any game in the history of man-kind has faced this issue and this will forever be a thing.
---
yeah, culling was so much fun
---
Not all of them have "key" or "running" in their names, but I think you're just being ironic :)
---
No matters who or where is playing this person. A hacker/exploiter/cheater is what is, and should be banned without hesitate.
---
Said this, Arenanet seems to be lacking in fast action when WvW is related. There are still some exploits being used, and devs aren't taking actions so fast as they should, with clear evidences of the "crime".
---
Disheartening.
---
I can prove it all though, questionable as it is
---
PvP queue is short because devs made matchmaking to expand pretty quick if no players are found. 
---
PvE instances are 70-150 players each. You can't make it solid argument that "game is healthy" if you see 3-4 instances during meta event. That would mean there are &lt;1000 players playing the content.
---
WvW queues are nothing unusual, but they are not happening every day (may differ depending on your server). Player limits for WvW are also not that big.
---
All of these show there may be about 10 000 active players. That's not that much.
---
I have no idea why you are being downvoted tbh...
---
You just gave me a list of things veteran player could face to experience content drought. And i completely agree. That's no indication of a dead/dying game by all means.  
---
You and your fellow veterans moved on. The vast majority of players is still only half way there and some are just walking in. All gamemodes have the numbers that imply a healthy player base. You and your fellow veterans missing from those numbers isn't relevant in terms of game health. It's relevant because you want to see changes. Those two are not the same thing.  
---
Veteran players experiencing drought =/= dead game.  
---
A low player base = dead game.
---
&gt; Keyfarmers are easily filtered from the rest.
---
How
---
&gt; Most of them actually have names indicating they keyfarm
---
Assumption
---
&gt; Most of them move quickly from one point to another, non stop, on a raptor to speed up the process.
---
Keyfarmers don't linger.
---
Assumption. Very often during my weekly keyfarm I afk more than play. You would never guess if I'm new player or not.
---
&gt; You clearly don't play Queensdale the way i play it.
---
I doubt you play it at all.
---
Yes. Like many veterans i'm bored out. So i change my playstyle and relax in Queensdale which i actually enjoy. Whenever new content comes out and there's things i want/need, i'll get more active across other areas of the game again.
---
No, you can't, unless the player made an effor to flex titles, outfits, armors, mounts, gliders etc. If I created new character with RP name and changed nothing, you would never tell if I'm new or not.
---
so you are basicly 3 hours every day in afk in queensdale.... ok. ppv que is fast since its matches potato vs legendary players. i didnt seen wvw que since relese of mount. just a newsflash for you,yes there can be milion new players every day,but how many of them last for more than a week? 90% of my friends stopped playing in last 3 years,thats a factor for me,if you think that 100 new players every day in ftp game is factor for you,ok.
---
As somebody in the Raid scene for the past few years, it's 100% dying out.
---
yeah, you moron have no clue at all.
---
&gt;if somebody is ambigious about games and wants to experience a competitive place, then gw2 is already dead.
---
That right off the bat is a whole other criteria for determining whether a game is dead or alive.  
---
I'm going by population based on what i've seen across all content. The moment i have to wait a long time to do whatever content i want because no people are playing it, i would probably think twice before calling the game alive.
---
You really have a hate boner for people who do 10 man content.
---
So ever since WoW made the WoW token in WoD, every game is dead/dying based on what you said before.
---
So the fact that 2 wvw guilds and a raid/fractal guild are dead is a sign that it's an alive game for you. Got it.
---
The fact that you see people spawn in queensdale daily isn't a sign that the game is alive either if they quit 2 days later. 
---
And if you believe a pool of 5/200 people active isn't good enough, i'm sure a pool of you watching queensdale is much better.
---
They better deliver stuff,  not promises.
---
So how can you say the game is alive if you don't play the other game modes yourself in primis because there's nothing new to do?
---
Countering your arguments with your own words...
---
I run full glass with scepter/warhorn tempest. Armor of earth and the shield are really good defensive utilities if you can time it right. Using the earth elemental from the elite skill to tank for you is very useful. But your best survival skill is proper dodging and using the heal skill at the right time.
---
For MMORPGs yes, there isn't any non-whale game left. Maybe WoW Classic will fix that since it won't have a token but that's it.
---
Other genres don't have this problem. In a shooter selling skins isn't as bad as in MMORPGs because in shooters the main satisfaction comes from winning. In MMORPGs the main satisfaction comes from looting after you won.
---
Teach us master of hate of anything that isn't open world.
---
&gt;pvp que is fast since its matches potato vs legendary players.
---
Source on that?  
---
&gt;  i didnt seen wvw que since relese of mount. 
---
Server dependent so i somewhat agree.  
---
&gt; just a newsflash for you,yes there can be milion new players every day,but how many of them last for more than a week? 
---
I add them to friendlist, follow them and watch their AP progress over time. Many of them stick around for at least some time. Some get into the expansions.   
---
&gt;  90% of my friends stopped playing in last 3 years,thats a factor for me,if you think that 100 new players every day in ftp game is factor for you,ok. 
---
New players = new friends. Not that difficult. You spend your life with a small group of people and never expand your contacts? That says more about you then the state of the game.   
---
&gt; there was time,when you can log at any time of the day and t4 fractals had 10 pts looking for more 
---
Granted, could be a bit less now. Still no problem getting into T4 any time of the day.  
---
&gt; ls maps had at lest 5 groups each and now you can watch EMPTY lfg in prime time,dung lfg is dead most of the time,fractal lfg has 1-2 ppl looking for more off peak hours and ls maps? look for yourself. 
---
Wholeheartedly disagree. Any content is doable, there are many players around to play with. Maybe you play between 3AM and 6AM in central Europe?
---
Considering it's a struggle to even get people to benchmark certain builds due to lack of interest/playing other games, I highly doubt that. Hell I doubt nearly half the testing with Power Rev/Necro would have happened if I haven't kept benching them.
---
I know from a 'casual veteran' player's perspective all this stuff seems to come without much delay, but guides/benchmarks/build craft is getting harder and harder to do each patch.
---
I'm sorry you feel bad about people asking questions to others in-game rather then using google.
---
in pvp you will play against bots.  
---
wvw is unplayable at times because either you overrun, the other side overruns or there is no one at both sides.  
---
if you are not good at dungeons / fractals and being able to carry, outside of the few good meta pugs its a slog...no fun to play at all.  
---
getting a raid static together or new people which fit to you is hard as ever.
---
I feel you, I always read how people just started and they dropped precursors from some random event, or ascended boxes, yet the most I ever got was a hydra head mini from Sandswept Isles which went for like 50g on TP. And I've been playing since headstart
---
True. Set your own goals!
---
We are already discussing it elsewhere, but since you started... If your assumptions were true, you would experience this in all starting locations, not just queensdale.
---
I play everything in the game, but nice try.
---
You leave out the most important part. You can get mount skins by other means in these games. How many mount skins are there in gw2 out of the gemstore? Oh right, not a single one.
---
Just because there is new players doesn't mean that total amount of players isn't decreasing.
---
What if there was always the same amount of new players joining as now but it balanced out with quitters? What if your new players are leaving after a month?
---
Yeah to be fair I didn't think people would upvote my shit post and it would die in new, guess people really do upvote post like this and don't check my post history.
---
I hop into PvP, WvW regularly for dailies. I just finished skyskale and went all across Tyrie PvE and joined commanders in Map Metas. I join T4's about 3 times a week, usually just before reset. I run dungeons, specifically AC, CoE, TA and CM about twice a week with new players. The only content i don't regularly touch is raids because they are more time consuming. My guild has them scheduled and does them every week, i just don't join that often.
---
I'm sure you telling people to just quit and fuck off it's a good argument against all of the criticism other people have for 4 out of 6 game modes.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Even though this is a meme I do raid with someone from Venezuela who plays on a laptop, it's not ideal but he can play ok for the most part
---
whiney bitchy streamers? yes I tell them to fuck.
---
Cause I wanted to see if people upvoted blatantly stupid shit like this.
---
He gets it
---
My point was that since the government crack down its unlikely to get new players from that country, not that its impossible to have players from there since 2012.
---
So you playing 2 game modes just for daily is a sign of alive game mode. Quick info, playing 10/day for daily won't give you any insight, but  I'm sure you know more about it than me since i only have 18k hours invested into wvw and fractal cms/raids.
---
Have to say I'm really sick of them dropping patches in the middle of eastern prime time. They should alternate the times in which they interrupt game play, it's two days running our guild gets booted midway through a keep defense on WvW.
---
GW2 isn't the most popular game and never was. It's still populated enough to play all content you wish at any time. That's the key ingredient to any game. That's the whole point of the game not being dead.  
---
Game population is everything. If a game's population is too low, players won't play because of the time you have to wait and it's gonna become a viscous circle.  
---
If the game population is high, it indicates that it's doing something right to attract people and maintain people. As of today, GW2 is fine in terms of population.
---
You're being a whiny bitch yourself but instead of bringing valid point you rather see everyone quit than bring up solutions.
---
Honk more.
---
On top of that...the game warns you too
---
7k + hour how much afk in queensdale ? Dont call yourself vétéran dude cause ur not
---
Oh yeah for sure its impossible to buy anything like a laptop there right now and these expansions which are only 30 USD are unaffordable due to their currency being shit atm
---
mean if the games dead and if the volume you see run by counts as players doing there 1 key run per week then has to mean 90% of the community is there key running :P
---
ok may not be 90% but there is a metric crap ton of them running around with those words in there name :P its funny seeing what they come up with name wise
---
&gt;So the fact that 2 wvw guilds and a raid/fractal guild are dead is a sign that it's an alive game for you. Got it.
---
Guild die out and new guild emerge. It's a nartural thing that happens a lot. You seem to have numbers on guild dying out and no new guilds emerging. Do share.  
---
&gt; The fact that you see people spawn in queensdale daily isn't a sign that the game is alive either if they quit 2 days later. 
---
My friendlist that shows new player growing rapidly in AP begs to differ.
---
There are people looking for sponsored RP sessions on lfg so yeah, there are some creative ways to make gold.
---
Meanwhile having "sexy" or even "sega" is inappropriate. They should add exceptions especially for "sexy". It's such a harmless word especially considering most of the userbase is over 30years old.
---
There isn’t any toxicity because
---
#THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE.
---
&gt;Yeah we've finished it all when the last relevant update for my 2 wvw guilds was pips 3 years ago.
---
Your ENTIRE 2 wvw guilds are experiencing drought?  
---
And that's representative of the entire game how?
---
2 infact
---
&gt;  This is causing the competitive scenes to die out.
---
PvP has been a mummified corpse for the past 4 years
---
In short: 
---
* WvW: Since PoF came out almost two years ago the only things that changed were Warclaw release with its huge amount of map breaking exploits, mesmer/chrono got fucked and spellbreaker bubble is a channel skill. FB+Scourge meta is absolute hell and not fun to play against. Alliances was announced looong ago, it's still not here
---
* PvP: Monthly Automated Tournament is currently disabled, swiss tournament was announced [at least a year ago](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/42973/pvp-features-in-progress-updated-june-8-2018) and it's still not here. Not sure if people care about this but in the last 3 years they added only two new maps and for some reason Spirit Watch appears on the select screen once every full moon
---
* Raids: Slow release cadence, wing 7 is way too easy, the challange modes do nothing
---
* Fractals: Only two fractal challenge modes, devs who designed them are not at Anet anymore, therefore unlikely we will ever get a new one. Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe people are not a fan the fractals that came out in the PoF era (Twilight Oasis Deepstone and Siren's Reef) while Nightmare and Mistlock Observatory from the HoT era, especially with cm enabled, are the favorites.
---
* Dungeons:
---
&gt; crap ton
---
queensdale instance limit is 70? or 100? You can't see that many, even if 100% of them were unique players and not just side accounts.
---
All you have is anecdotal evidence. You have no valid tools to make assumptions about player count.
---
I applaud how far you have entertained this line of reasoning with this scrub. I can’t go any further it’s so painful to read. 
---
“3 prompts and I still didn’t realize what was happening... ANet is the worst!!!”
---
So did you learn your lesson?
---
EU or NA, played through everything in this game on full zerk or condi ele , most of it is knowing when you have to take some defensive utilities but mostly just knowing when to use dodges,  los, as some said glyph of storms in earth or if sword weaver knowing you have tons of evades on hands most of the time.  
---
If EU i can take some time ingame to help.
---
Still can't believe someone gave silver I thought I made it obvious
---
You're welcome to come argue about that with 1.2k of us  discord.gg/uyuPxCN 
---
I think a pool of 30ish guild is enough now or is it not? Since it's pretty much all of wvw guilds in eu
---
Pepehands
---
lol classic? I'm going to guess a shit ton of people will try it but almost none will stay. I too was jumping up and down to play but after a while I realized I don't have the time for it. Pretty much anyone that works, has hobbies, has a social life won't have time for a proper classic experience. I mean not many people are willing to slog through 2 months of leveling (if you are just a normal working person with a social life) just to get to even more grind before you can actually do big group content.
---
Boy the moment I got wind of the home cats, I went crazy to gather them. I got like 20 the first day, then another 5 later on. Im still missing 10 tho.
---
What's the fun in that when there is more drama to be had with a blatant shitpost
---
Haha same, selling loot from Drops at the Trading Post, sell my crafts and daily rewards... My first 100 Gold still saving for skins or gems.
---
Dhuum CM is easier than Solid Ocean 
---
:)
---
&gt;Ben on official PvP forums
---
Has a developer mentioned exactly how the system works or is it all bro-science?  
---
&gt; You are using this argument to say game is healthy. Is 4 instances of 150 players healthy? You have no instruments to count active playerbase. 
---
As long as you can actively play the content you like without having to wait for more people to show up, the game is fine. Assuming it can maintain itself with those numbers. 4 instances for you to join! That's more then enough. Do you have the instruments to count active player base and make assumptions on how many instance filled players are required for the game to be considered healthy?   
---
&gt; There are tools that mitigate consequences of low playerbase. That doesn't automatically mean the game is in healthy state. 
---
A healthy state would be enough population to do whatever you want. Which is the case. Whether it's financially healthy is unknown to me.
---
&gt; There are many players in between so to speak that will replace any veteran that left to do what you just described.
---
You can't replace an All Star Team with benchwarmers and expect the same results.
---
10 sticks of butter.
---
Yet Anet ended up nerfing Orr.  Seems to me, you might be reading into the comments more than is intended. This game has always been skewed more to casuals, which is why there were so many complaints about not enough difficult content. It was why Heart of Thorns introduced raids and a much harder open world, which then had to be nerfed, because HoT was too hard for the masses.  HOT lost a lot of players, because the game up until then was pretty much piss easy, or at least, most of the playerbase only did the easier content.  There's a reason they went in and nerfed HOT. It wasn't because the bulk of the population wanted more challenging content.
---
And I live in the same country as the real-life "[Caledon Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_Forest)" :)
---
**Caledonian Forest**
---
The Caledonian Forest is the name given to the former (ancient old-growth) temperate rainforest of Scotland. 
---
The Scots pines of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the Late Glacial; arriving about 7000 BC. The forest reached its maximum extent about 5000 BC, after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by 2000 BC. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) reduced it to its current extent.
---
Today, that forest exists as 35 remnants, as authenticated by Steven &amp; Carlisle (1959) (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about 180 square kilometres (69 sq mi) or 44,000 acres (18,000 ha).

Nah he's just better then you. JK that's a cheat
---
&gt; It's still populated enough to play all content you wish at any time.   
---
uh, no. i had a lot of times in the last few months were i just quit the game because either wvw, dungeons, raids or fractals weren't playable since no people there.  
---
def. not "at any time" anymore.
---
Somehow. Raids suck but I can do them on lower graphics. It gets nice and hot but still playable surprisingly
---
Woah that takes me back
---
&gt; Has a developer mentioned exactly how the system works or is it all bro-science?
---
after few minutes ranking brackets are being widened to shorten the queue, that's why we can see complaints of platinum players matched with/against gold players.
---
&gt; As long as you can actively play the content you like without having to wait for more people to show up, the game is fine.
---
No, that means only that "you can actively play the content you like without having to wait for more people to show up". You can't say that game as a service is fine, because you don't know how much longer it can survive or if it's in decline, stagnation or rise.
---
&gt;  Do you have the instruments to count active player base and make assumptions on how many instance filled players are required for the game to be considered healthy?
---
State of the game is not just playerbase. For example PvP, WvW, Raids and Fractals are mostly neglected by developers. That's more than half of available game modes. Is your body healthy if we remove more than half of its organs?
---
&gt; A healthy state would be enough population to do whatever you want. Which is the case. Whether it's financially healthy is unknown to me.
---
well then, we can agree that playerbase is not the issue, but it still doesn't mean the game is healthy. You can't say how much longer gw2 will proceed or for how long the content playerbase will stay healthy. If I encourage someone to buy all expacs today and game shuts down in 3 months, it would look as I cheated that person.
---
did you YEET you camera when you took this ?
---
Dungeons most definitely did get nerfed, with the introduction of break bars. They are much much easier now. Not to mention the power creep that came with both HoT and PoF. There are two ways to nerf a dungeon. Make the dungeon weaker or make everyone else more powerful. They both work.
---
Fractals were certainly nerfed, certainly the lower levels at any rate.   I'm pretty sure they nerfed Arah Path 4 at the very least. And they've recently nerfed a lot of the instabilities in Fractals as well.
---
Did this subreddit learn the lesson?
---
I've been playing just for the community, and the community is shrinking more and more daily. As i said you're welcome to come argue about wvw on the discord with 1135 people  discord.gg/uyuPxCN and you'll see that it's not even close to being healthy.
---
I brought up enough points for my standpoint about hipycrite streamers. 
---
"everyone quit" lmao. take these little communities to wow and have fun. glad we lose you.
---
The missing part seems to be they used the boost on their main character instead of the new character. In order for support to refund the ticket the character needs to be deleted.
---
Shit you right I'm stupid and have a lot to learn. I guess I have to start somewhere and ask for your forgiveness before moving on
---
&gt; no one upvoted your shitpost
---
Look at the top right. It was way higher before people started to hand out the red pill.
---
Yes I shook it as hard as possible for maximum effect
---
breakbar introcution was a buff. you could hold bosses perma stunned with icebow 5. no idea what you are talking about.  
---
dungeons are easier now because of balance and powercreep, not because of breakbars.
---
That would require ANET to:
---
a) care
---
b) care about WvW
---
c) care about negatively impacting WvW
---
d) see A
---
I'm not going to play wow so you're welcome to fuck off as well.
---
Anet is such for allowing this to continue. 
---
You're not even allowed to mention it on their official forum.
---
And players who hack only get a 3-month ban. 
---
Like this guy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRfwF9fh9kE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRfwF9fh9kE)

He's back hacking, maybe the same WSR guy as mentioned by Js\_T in this thread.
---
Yeah honestly its dumb post like that which inspired this
---
We seem to have a different definition of veteran. You're welcome to share yours to see if i can match.
---
Is it just me or do people go to do something they really need to do then end up playing with toys or tonics instead and end up procrastinating for hours😂
---
THe gAMe is riSeN. Not really dead, not really alive.
---
Nah, the way it was before, defiance was much harder to understand and going in with a group that wasn't some super organized hard core group, people just ignore it, because it was too hard to explain. The break bar put everyone in the same page, because it was easier to understand.
---
Defiance has always been in the game. The break bar made defiance something everyone could do/learn and it made dungeons for pugging a lot easier. My personal experience anyway.
---
Congratulations! Delusional posts like that led this game to the ruin. You can be proud of yourself. ArenaNet developers heard such opinions for years now. So they felt like they don't have to do anything with their game. Just milking their delusional playerbase.

My game cant start after installing the dll files on a clean gw2 (v1.1-1.5)

&gt;GW2 is NOT dying. Not even close.
---
I'm a veteran player. 7k+ Hours in. I spend most of my time (3h a day) in Queensdale mentoring new players.
---
The stream of new players coming in is huge and fairly continues. I've got a huge friends list with new players.
---
This doesn't mean anything.
---
Other MMOs have been shut down when people didn't think they was dying.
---
I am not saying this is the case but saying you meet 20 new players an hour, who likely are not buying anything, doesn't mean anything in regards to the future of the game.
---
&gt;Queuing PvP is usually quick and indicates good enough population.
---
Queueing PvP puts high silvers against top 250s, lets not even pretend PvP is remotely thriving in this game.
---
&gt;WvW often has ques, indicating good enough population.
---
Purely due to server merges and outside of primetime, where 1 map has a queue, they don't.
---
TLDR: Your missing the core issue with most of the complaints and in regards to game health - Your just speculating, you don't know anything either.
---
well, if we still talk about instances...there was a time earlier in the year in which i did arround 5 to 6 dungeons each day for about 3 weeks. in none of them anyone broke the bar if i didn't do it myself.  
---
all of those groups were casuals since i always wrote "everyone welcome" when opening the groups.  
---
maybe you are already a bit biased since you definitly aren't casual and inform other people about gamemechanics. most players still ignore that nor do they ask anything. even explaining portals and aksing to use them was moot.  
---
my experience. :)
---
Your experience is absolutely valid. It's just that before, even after explaining I couldn't get the defiance stacks off, but now I can, so that's what I'm talking about. Also I find low level fractals, entry level fractals far easier than they used to be.   
---
Case in point, I used to have to do 4 fractals in a row, including a boss fractal and they were random. Now I can just pick the ones I want. That makes it easier to me.
---
Oof u are a horrible person.
---
Am I really though
---
Well if the total amount of players stay the same, then it's not dead.
---
Yeah and also in need of the online attention to compensate the non existing one irl. Here I’ll give you 10 secs of my life and forget about you in the next.
---
I would ask around if your server has a discord.  From there you can meet a lot of other people and do roaming or guild raids.  ****
---
She definitely doesn’t sound ditzy though, especially once yoi get to HoT.
---
This was not the point. He said two weeks, I said that he most likely meant wow. No need for that rant. But whatever suits you
---
You can access the world map from the crown pavillion. You just need to change the map layer first - the bottom right icon in world map.
---
It's maintained by Domi.
---
Guilds of the Mists discord.  discord.gg/uyuPxCN
---
I play NA
---
&gt; Arenanet seems to be lacking in fast action when WvW is related. 
---
Including content!
---
WvW is okay on EU because there are an endless sea of pugs entering and fighting. It's a whole different story on NA where the pug scene has not been strong for a while: now that guilds leave, the game is very much dying. Let's use the most basic of **stats** to confirm this, comparing NA to EU (which EU players say is "dying" by their metric):
---
The 3rd lowest EU server, Drakkar Lake, had an activity of 59.5k this week. The average NA activity is for this week is 54.8k and the median is 55k. NA activity for the average server (their distribution of activity being relatively flat) is lower than the 3rd worst server on EU. Also keep in mind NA has a more even distribution of timezones, having players from South East Asia, Oceania, South America, etc. playing.
---
The result is basically that off-peak timezones usually playable are now barely playable to unplayable in 3/4 tiers (OCX, SEA, EU timezones). NA peak timezones reach around half the activity of EU peak. 
---
The "death" of the game doesn't come from where the game is most populated. It's not going to see the decay and death in Queensdale, or EU prime time, or Lions Arch, or whatever. The first pieces that give way are the more niche activities, like OCX/SEA/EU timezone NA server WvW, NA sPvP, and now the NA Raid scene outside of a short window in NA prime. 
---
What comes next? Well, once off-peak timezones start falling off, without Anet doing something to reverse the trend it starts flowing over to the peak. And before you know it, things are dropping fast. I took a quick break from the game, came back, and the content I was playing just a few months ago was now unplayable, or very difficult to find. I'm sure EU prime is very healthy, and NA prime is still doing okay, but I can see that perhaps in a year's time NA prime will also see decline. And then EU prime. Etc.
---
There's no fear mongering going around, I'm sure what Anet can announce will remedy this, or they plan to transition to another project or something. It's just very clear to me, as someone who doesn't play on the most populated region at the most populated timezone, that the depopulation at higher (veteran) levels is kicking in and having the biggest impact on my experience.
---
&gt; Sounds like you have been biased by YouTube comments instead of reality.  
---
that is the reality. the outside world which did not play gw2 not experienced anything related to it activly thinks this game is a bad game. this is a fact and has nothing to do with my opinion. people legit think this is a casual shit game because of all they heard about it and news sites not really covering anything...seeing certain twitch channels are just the cherry ontop for them.  
---
&gt; You just follow this equation: if no new raids then it's not hardcore  
---
eh no, i don't.
---
Cool!
---
*checks account*
---
Meh...
---
open your map, and use a waypoint. if you open your map from the Crown Pavilion, you'll be on a layer beneath the "normal" layer of the world map, so you'll have to click to change that (bottom-right corner of world map, iirc)
---
From a perspective of a new pvp player and despite various negative comments I found it quite good, would say I had a lot more competitive games than those plagued by bots or one sided. However, I can imagine it can be pretty stale for veterans of the mode.
---
Still in Charr starting zone. It could just be that I haven’t gotten to crystal oasis yet so maybe the zones immplaying in are fairly dead or I just play at inopportune times
---
Okay don't even make me laugh about the PVP thing, that community *is* dead.
---
Anet: Hey we released more mount skins thats all we do nowdays
---
I-i was just pretending!
---
That person is not really 'from' Baruch Bay. He's a german spy. One of those accounts that jump to enemy worlds preemptively to tell their allies about their movements while keeping T6 participation to farm pips in the meantime.
---
Hopefully being able to hide tags will help against that kind of flagrantly coward tactic.
---
Off season doesn't give pips so many average players don't play, and unranked can let you premake a full 5 party. Both of these means you'll be playing with and against people wildly different from you in skill and rank tier, leading to sometimes Really one-sided games.
---
Says the person that pvps twice a day.
---
Remember when The Ascension was planned as being one out of several PvP legendary backpacks? Hell even the NPC says ”**THIS** years backpack” when you talk to him.
---
PvP ranked queue is really long at higher ratings, and the top of the ladder is essentially the same players and their alt accounts.
---
PvP random queue only takes 10 people to trigger, it doesn't indicate population at all, I have similarly decent PvP queues in GW1 random arena.
---
Don't forget that they started grouping servers in 2016. And it doesn't say much about population either.
---
I'm not saying the game is dying, I don't claim to know anything about that. Just that the points taken out of your personal experience don't advance your claim.
---
I think it's a good idea to share your knowledge to other players, but as you have so many questions, maybe you should find some people to help you with your guild and share their knowledge / experience as well \^\^
---
So, my thoughts are:
---
1) I don't think that the commander tag is needed, but it has some advantages: When doing guild missions you can take the lead (commander tag), make ready checks to see if your members are ready or use squad symbols. For guild missions that's just a nice feature, but you might need that later if you want to start raiding. Also in open world meta events you can use the tag to gather more people, but honestly a mentor tag is enough for that. Before I got my commander tag, we used to use a squad without commander and I got targeted and it was enough \^\^ 
---
2) A guild hall can offer you some nice things such as buffs for gold, wvw/pvp and more. You can also have your own guild arena to pvp or some plants/ores and stuff to collect. But the feature I love the most: You can use decorations and build some really cool stuff. But you need a lot of gold / materials to upgrade your guild hall. Nevertheless, when planning to do guild missions I'd recommend to get the guild hall and level it up, because this will unlock even more guild mission slots. I'm not sure on this, but I think without a guild hall that's not the case.
---
3) Are you talking about the scribe? It's a nice feature if you want to decorate your guild hall, but apart from that it does not offer a lot. So if you want to decorate, then go for it. About max costs: Search for scribe leveling guide, you should find some good information about the current prices.
---
4) If you just want to share your knowledge and get players to play together, why not? There are some limitations to f2p accounts, so as the guild leader it might be good to look them up, but there is also a lot of content that f2p and b2p can do together. However, I always recommend f2p players to buy the game / expansions, cause they offer some nice benefits and a lot of content.
---
5) You have 5 guild slots, so yes you can keep your old guild.
---
6) As far as I know, the alliance system is only for wvw. But I might be wrong \^\^
---
7) I'm rarely doing core tyria meta events, but you can always do world bosses. There are easy bosses like shadow behe, and also some more challenging bosses such as the triple trouble (this one needs organisation though). Maybe you can also do the temple events in Orr.
---
8) It depends on what you want to do. If you want to find out about mechanics, squad comps etc on your own, then just go for raids with your guildmates. But I'd prefer my raid leader to have some knowledge about that content, cause there are a lot of things to consider (squad comps, roles of the players, mechanics of the boss etc). If you can have fun when permanently wiping and now even knowing why, okay fine. I just know, I'd not have fun doing this \^\^
---
Ascended gear is great, but actually exotic gear is also fine. You won't be able to achieve the same numbers as players with ascended gear (considering they're just "as good as you") and you might need to adapt some equipment (because otherwise you will have less crit rate or boon duration etc), but exotic is just fine \^\^
---
I hope I can help you with that. Good luck!
---
What a cowardly piece of shit.
---
Look this video, is the same guy and the video is from 2017!! FTW Arenanet! Ban this account before 2023 T.T

---
Support can't really see your account info the way you do in-game and in GW2Efficiency. They get access to separate records.
---
Once I had to delete an entire set of Guild weapons bound to incorrect characters to get them back and be able to use them to craft a Tenebrous set, because the Support people could not see them in my account because they were very old and they were not in their records.
---
They have limited tools and control on what they can do.
---
You raided, so by your logic you were toxic.
---
Not a big deal.
---
Hot take: people raid for fun.
---
Tbf every time I tried ranked everyone else got hella douchey.  Kinda a turnoff when people spit bile instead of being constructive.
---
Gandara matchup, though not all guilds are from there.
---
Can't remember all the names but I've seen META and KISS run guild groups at least.
---
Yeah, I don’t really know about all that. I believe what you say.
---
I suppose I am entitlement. Part of it is because I have supported this game through gem store purchases for many years and I kind of feel like they should return me this small (in comparison) favor
---
Should always open first. You can get rates.
---
The real expose
---
&gt;Explain to me how PvP, WvW, Raids, **Dungeons** and fractals are dying out?
---
The fact that you’re asking how ***Dungeons*** are dying says a lot about how out of touched you are. Just because you’ll find people *eventually* to run one doesn’t mean that it’s in a healthy state.
---
It can't be before 2019-08-30 because that's when they are doing announcements. 
---
The 2019-09-17 is much loser to 3 months after last release but too far from the announcement, and 03 is just 4 days away from the announcement date and includes a weekend, not enough time to let people build up the hype and anticipation that brings back people before the release, so it would see that the most logical date would be 2019-09-10.
---
So you're first saying that the game objectively is in the best place it's ever been, then you admit you have 0 idea about pvp. You probably pretend to care about other game modes too, when you're probably an open world casual. Someone who played even a bit of wvw recently would have the warclaw, and you say its a good feature because you can get back to fights faster (did anyone say rallybot?)
---
To some degree I agree with you. But the fact that cosmetics that are behind either a paywall(be it cash or gold) compared to actual ingame challanges is a big punch in the face. Here is a comment about the 100CM red infusion that perfectly sums it up:
---
&gt; You completly missed the point. We're pissed that they said they would look into fixing the textures of the infusions ages ago and instead they've put a gemstore dyable hd "infusion" behind cash, telling once again the players doing hard content for rewards to fuck off because gemstore &gt; in game challenges.
---
Not every cosmetic should be in the gemstore and there shouldn’t be an unreasonable big gap either between ingame cosmetics and gemstore cosmetics.
---
There's no way that's just latency
---
They raid because it's a casual setting every week. Veterans already did everything on it.
---
Point 1: Incorrect, I explicitly stated what happened. I didn’t here as I didn’t feel the need to post the whole conversation. Can still do though.
---
Point 2: Correct.
---
Point 3: Also correct, I provided ample information. 
---
Point 4: Also incorrect, which I can prove with the timestamps on the messages in the ticket and the time my OP was posted.
---
And yes, I preferred getting a flat out no as I assumed they would, after me explicitly telling them, realize that no one on earth would delete a nearly 6 year old character with almost 3000 hours on it for an item worth 2000 gems. Them suggesting it tells me they either only read the title of my ticket or did read the whole e-mail but chose to not verify it and instead click and auto reply from a drop down box.
---
You just reminded me of something that made me very very sad...and that I blocked out of my mind... :(
---
Get ready for some snow now :)
---
That is a generic response to a generic question.  The GM has no knowledge of the age of the character on which you used the booster.

P2W legendary, men you are in the wrong subreddit there is no such thing as p2w cosmetics.

It has one of the best maps tho IMO from LS3. Also introduces some juicy lore about the gods and risen.

This subreddit have good material to write a tesis about psicology

Noooo dont stop here, pls keep going

or about the relevance of pvp streamers *shrug *

There’s lots of reasons why only 6 guilds showed up for teapot’s tourney. And it’s not just because the raid scene is dead. Most (NA) guilds don’t take ERP seriously anymore. It’s just unnecessary drama that requires huge personal time commitments and sacrifices. Partaking in that tournament isn’t just “show up and kill bosses,” it involved weeks, if not months, of practice beforehand. I was in a guild that was asked to compete, but all of our schedules are far too busy.
---
For a vet, is the game dying if mainly do open world content?  Not really.  Is the game dying if you mainly do things like raids, fractals, PvP or WvW?  You betcha!  One raid wing with 3 bosses every 10 months is laughable, 1 new fractal every 7-8 months is a joke, zero attention given to PvP or WvW since forever.  Problems in PvP or WvW are left to fester for years with zero attention given to them from developers.  Instead, they add stuff that no one wanted like a mount or a new 2v2 map instead of things people have been asking for for a very very long time.  Look at the server populations for both NA and EU, only 2 are full on NA and most are marked High or Medium.  This is in very stark contrast to even a year ago.  And queues on the maps?  At reset there are queues but even then they are much lower than what they used to be and a lot of the times the borderlands have no queue one hour into reset which used to be unheard of.  Outside of the prime times there is zero queue.
---
If you enjoy mindless farming of Open World content then this game isn't dead and probably never will be.  If you enjoy swiping your credit card every 2 weeks on new gemstore items then this came isn't dead.  If you enjoy raids, fractals, PvP or WvW then this game is very close to dead.
---
As somebody in the raid scene for the past few years, it’s 0% dying out :)

I run training raids every Tuesday and they are always filled within a minute of advertising them

Praise be unto Entropy, the one true god™!

Congrats OP, you just proved two things with your shitpost:
---
* This subreddit does actually upvote and even award with gold/silver any post even slightly praising the company or discrediting the current situation, no matter how low effort it is. White Knighting is a thing, even more so than doomsaying.
---
* People online believe anything a header says without actually researching any further. We live in a society where people just like things for their entertainment value and not for what they actually are.

As Of Montreal said in their song “Gronlandic Edit”, “I guess it would be nice to give my heart to a God. But which one, which one do I choose?” There's a certain level of comfort that comes from accepting a religion. Accepting a (potential) fairy tale ending to a life is much easier than accepting that it simply ends with no rhyme or reason.
---
You don't consider 7k hours as veteran-worthy? That's 2h45min per day since launch you know
---
But I *want to* mainly play raids. And I try to play as best as possible. Am I a toxic casual elitist now?
---
If a mmo veteran spends 3 hours a day hanging out at a starter zone mentoring only, the mmo has got underlying issues (severe lack of content that the veteran can have that much free time not pursuing these contents instead)
---
I applaud you for your effort. 7 years gw2er here as well and I'm excited for the upcoming live event and the anniversary birthday gift with the unique Victory Rock chair.
---
#stayhopeful
---
I guess they figure that EU night time play it will go unnoticed, its almost like they think when they die i wont notice them instantly spawning back at north camp on the HBL, amazing how they can cover the entire map in under 5 seconds.
---
I dont know whats worse though, the fact they are using it so clearly, or the fact they know they can use it, as nothing will happen.
---
It was a social experiment and people failed it.
---
The only thing we can mod is the interface.
---
Oh wow, Ive got to try this. One of those QoL hints which are still new to you even after several k hours!
---
Riddle me this: I played GW since 2006, never played WoW and I raid in gw2. 
---
What's your explaination for this?
---
Plot twist: all the players you've been mentoring in Queensdale are actually BL key farming bots XD . 
---
But in all seriousness, the game is still great for someone who is just starting out.  There is a lot of old content for a new player to experience.  So technically the game isn't dying per say.  
---
What is dying (or long dead depending on how you look at it) is the new content and the endgame.  What do I mean by this? Well for me the new content has been dead since LS3.  That is when the episodes started drifting into the set template format (map, currency, similar achievements each episode, etc.).  We would get a story that you could complete in a couple hours, then not much else.  The endgame is dying because they've essentially put pvp and wvw on maintenance modes.  They haven't seen any real fundamental changes or shakeups in awhile.  Dungeons are completely abandoned.  Raid release times have slipped.  Content as a whole has been dumbed down.  Open world is an afk auto attack snooze fest.  And then add fuel to the fire, the gemstore keeps constantly getting most of the attention (and don't for a second give me the "well they have to make money", i've spent so much money on this game it's insane).  The recent star outfit was a final straw for me, because the texture looks great and the celestial infusion is still fucked.  For a player that has been here awhile the shift in the game for me is def a major complaint.
---
Note: By no means is any of these complaints aimed at new players and encouraging them to not play.  I 110% think someone who has never played and is interested in the game should play it.  But I also think new players should be aware of what the state of the game is.
---
All those elements to attune to, yet you choose to be salty
---
That's really delusional, you consider a minuscule part of the community and you use it to try to prove your point. Being a veteran is all about expérience and thus playtime
---
Turn off chat, problem fixed. Theres 0 reason to have chat turned on in ranked, minimap is all the communication you need until p1.
---
This guy is hard rping in reddit. But to be fair, he has a unique view. He believes every toxic gw2 is from from WoW and as long as you don't raid 24/7 in gw2 you are a casual not a toxic elitist.
---
WvW population is declining fast, like others have said it depends on your server, im on a T1 EU server and its dead most days, at prime time we are lucky if we can Queue 1 map, mostly the commanders struggle to get a full squad, added to that Anet have now made invisible commander tags so you may struggle to find a tag full stop now, 
---
EotM was killed off by older hardcore WvW players complaining about the rewards in EotM and demanded Anet nerf it to all hell, and they did, the same players then complained that pugs where using the WvW maps, and belittled them and harassed them until they quit the WvW, fast forward a few years, them same hardcore players are now crying on the forums that its a dead format with no players, its a double edged sword.
---
You always were. People enjoy doing everything. They are multiple game modes. If you just play one you are a casual. While nothing wrong with that. It is wrong to be a toxic elitist that is jealous of people that do everything better and try to be a hard nut that shields his image behind a toxic elitist too look strong but forgetting that he is the lowest rank of casual as even the open world they hate the most probably play more than him.
---
Yes, imagine having to train doing CMs as a self-proclaimed hardcore guild. Weak excuse, just weak.
---
It's not really playtime but instead how early you started playing, like you might have played at launch but stopped playing after , sure you're a veteran but as long as someone else has more time play than you ( hours in game ) his opinion is more important than yours, because he played the fucking game, not you
---
Until there is no one left to milk. A lot of people are standing on the sideline watching Aug 30 event. Myself included. Up until recently I was still logging in weekly. Now I have stopped for nearly a month now, patiently, and with much hope, waiting for end of the month. I'll prolly log in for the anniversary though regardless.
---
It's actually hilarious how you put words into my mouth that I never said and assume, incorrectly of course, a lot about me. I obviously hit a nerve that stopped you thinking critically.
---
1. The majority of content added into the game IS trivial, there is no denying it, therefore i'm not trivialising it just stating a fact.
---
2. I actually like casual content and games, just a lot of GW2's casual content is boring for me for me as it is mindless, menial and tedious.
---
3. I never actually said I like hard challenging content.. As I said i'm pretty casual, just not hyper casual like most of GW2. I just like engaging gameplay which "hard challenging content" just happens to give, but not all engaging content is "hard".
---
Just to clear things up.
---
You just wanted to tell us you had ten stacks of ecto, didn't you?
---
Real life takes priority
---
Yeah fuck real life commitments and illnesses. You can’t be in a hardcore raid guild unless you bail on your mom dying of cancer in the hospice.
---
Problem is: competitive scenes are what most players make keep playing. The way that gw2 funktions these days is that new people join and leave in a short period of time until the next new player comes along. And that's not healthy nor what you would expect from a so called MMORPG.
---
I already did in my original comment. What’s the point of repeating myself?
---
cant argue with that.
---
Current mood in pvp : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6EHwNLc91Y
---
Sure, You said the spreadsheet was for GvG anyway.
---
I was responding to your "They aren't really raiding guilds because they suck" comment.
---
That being said (And I know it wasn't you) linking that document as a means to express how much demand their is for WvW changes is fucking stupid and I hope Arenanet never look at that shit to detemine if it's worth bothering with WvW.
---
You just fell for one of the biggest lie in the gaming industry. No, microtransactions are not being used because companies can only barely scrape by otherwise. They dont ensure you get top notch new content either.
---
Microtransactions are solely there to milk gamers because they hide how much you are nowadays spending on an mmo compared to sub model. They are being used because they make money for shareholders. Pure and simple. Nothing "fair" about it. Nothing "necessary".
---
Hell yeah! How many times did I cast and at the very last moment that asshole uses another skill haha
---
Oh yeah I still feel that pain as well.

How would you rate it

---
That was not always the case, no.  It was added once the F2P restrictions were implemented, and lower level players were barred from racial cities/Lion's Arch to minimize gold-selling spam.  To compensate for the Asura Gates being off-limits for a while, new players were given waypoints in all the starter zones, so friends who wanted to play as different races could still group up right away and play together.
---
Stop being so salty then. Always trigged at everything...
---
Well, you still can, if you're a paid player.  The restriction only hampers F2P accounts to dissuade gold-sellers.
---
Well there are other toxic players that are not from BfA sure I will give you that.
---
since when does experience equal game time? most people I met with over 30k ap were really bad/below average in any challanging content, both skillwise and basically experienced.
---
the captain is correct, someone who has 7k hrs in game time, but afk'ed like 4.5-5k hrs just talking with people in a city isn't experienced or a veteran at all.
---
So you would rather them charge for a sub ?
---
If that is true why you keep raiding? Something is off.
---
I agree that they wanted the whole experience to be endgame. My point was that they wanted challenge and competition to be a big part of that endgame through "challenging group content" like dungeons and an original focus on PvP, WvW. Didn't they say point specifically to WvW when people asked what there is to do at 80?
---
The game was about accessibility and "respecting your time", but still also offering challenges that were more skill dependent than grind dependent. Unfortunately, some people seem to think the game was always about being super casual and easy, but this was mostly down to poor balance of the original content.
---
well im not saying that game is dying :D,im just pointing out that its not as good as it was before,there is actualy plenty of new ppl game (failing metas and shit,T4 fractal pug = no clue about mechanics half of the time) and you can do dungs if you dont mind waiting,so game is doing still quite good.
---
You need to chiiiiilllll
---
Sure can, but only one
---
You misunderstood. That was an example of why a hardcore guild might not be able to do CMs for hours on end.
---
They raid because it's a casual setting every week even if they did everything on it. Because they can't do anything else.
---
I said on purpose..
---
30 relics a day is a drop in the bucket for what is needed to get all the titles. If you are not doing cms everyday and dont have all the titles you wont be getting enough encryptions to need the 30 extra keys every day. Also getting titles is (starts with the first one) is a large gold investment, so making sure you dont screw yourself over is a good thing.
---
&gt;I'm just answering the question.
---
With less than great advice about buying keys and selling all your encryptions.
---
You can go to Lions Arch at any level,  just hit B to bring up the WvW  window,  go to Edge of the Mists and take the portal there to LA.
---
Thanks!

Yea, I did read about this years ago, so admit my knowledge retention on that one ain't the best.

They will restore the legendary, but they will not restore it as an tradable item, if it has been sold or destroyed, since that unlocks the skin.
---
I won. You don't understand the concept of playing a game for fun.
---
He is correct tho, any person that wants challenging content will leave gw2. in the last 1-1.5year the quality of pugs decreased incredible hard from being casually 1-2shot w1-4 in a 150-250li group to hoping you get a boss kill in 5 tries with anything from 150-500li+. Or we just ignore the fact that even tho the dps numbers on dps classes is higher then it was back then, yet people manage to do worse dps, or the meta comp is now more safe and stronger for both heals and perma boons yet people die easier to basic mechanics/facetanking? So what actual raider would want to come to gw2 when you can go to any other MMO with 10 times better raids?
---
It's just a fact that the Hardcore scene in PvP, WvW and PvE is dead or near dead, if u want to ignore the fact nearly all big WvW guilds left, PvE guilds left (or are leaving after ERP) and PvP is just beyond a meme.
---
Quality
---
My point was rotate their patches so it isn't always the same group being inconvenienced over and over again.
---
and what is the name of this little Idiot who things to know me and spit BS about me, hm?
---
Any advice on getting started? Suggestions on a starter build?
---
I'm utterly bored with PvE atm and WvW is getting rather stale.  3.1k hrs in game so I know the basics, but have never set foot in any of the sPVP maps.
---
I'm pretty familiar with 8/9 professions (everyone but Ele), though none of the builds that are listed as 'meta' for PvP.
---
Eg. I've played Staff Daredevil, but never used sword/pistol on a thief ever.  700hrs of Hammer Herald in WvW but very little experience 1v1 sw/sw + staff.
---
Also not terribly good at 1v1 in WvW anyways, as I mostly work as a +1 in small squads or zergs.
---
If scaling is involved then Raid Boss would just wipe the zerg, because too few people in zerg will know the mechanics and rest would be headless chickens xD
---
That’s because most raiders worth their salt aren’t pugging raids, they have statics. 
---
I PUG every other night on stream and don’t see any difference in the quality of pugs lately anyway. Most bosses are between 1-3 shots. I also don’t ask for KP.  /shrug
---
People like to bitch on reddit because it’s an echo chamber, but things really aren’t that bad haha
---
I laughed harder at this than I should have.
---
tbh the majority of the community is complaining for years and yet gets what they want meanwhile the minority of the community only complaints once and we are being called crybabies. Also the "casuals" never had a solution to anything while the dedicated players have solutions how the game can be even better in comparison in the state it is now.
---
Raiders never said Raids are hard...they say that you need to know the mechanics of the boss and appropriate gear. It is the casuals that are toxic towards the raiders because they won't babysit them through Raids Wings...
---
I played quite a bit of WvW earlier and must say I avoided 1v1s like a plague because I was terrible at them (not having correct build was also a problem). Since stepping into pvp (as I got bored with pve/wvw too) I found myself being more reactive and altogether better during such duels. It came at a cost of time and effort of course, you just need to be aware that you won't be winning every match from the get go and ignore the occasional snarky comments (although these were very rare). 
---
As for the build I would say just pick the class you fill comfortable on in pve/wvw and pick a metabattle/godsofpvp build. It's highly possible you will need to learn to use another weapons than in pve/wvw, but it's the same for everyone. The build doesn't have to be meta, great ones will work too. I myself play boon soulbeast which is not considered meta by the site but still holds up quite good despite some nerfs. Also, you can decide from the get to if you prefer to help during team fights, duel, group support. At the beginning I would advise to stay with the group and help.
---
There's a big difference between 50 coppers and 400 golds. But yeah, you could argue with that that GW2's gemstore literally don't exist and its just very expansive gold items.
---
After season 2 when rytlock vanished into the mists, I really thought he would bring back Rurik's echo with him (I mean, that's what the Revenant could literally do). I feel like it was side-lined to make room for balthazar, but I wish they had gone into that more.
---
I'm still confused to this day about legendary armor. Isn't it tied to collections or do you still craft it after? Or are there other ways to obtain it? I've only ever dealt with weapons.
---
That must have been before wardrobe unlocks.
---
I got 2 somehow. As far as I could tell sometimes when unequipping the Alchemist tools (the ones that were removed) sometimes gave you the Glyph
---
Eles are squishy in nature and most important, they are a class that requires lots of practice on active defenses, positioning and etc.
---
It's my first and main class and my main advice is for him to practice how to avoid damage. Watch enemies moves and rotate around it always trying to get the best positioning.
---
Aside that, it's always useful to have: a stun break skill ( read in the skills description), stability skills, condi clears, reflect projectiles for some situations and other utilities to help you with your weakness.
---
Ex: I currently play a sword weaver and I run arcane shield for blocking and stun break, I also run arcane blast to blast my skills (for extra healing or might or other effects) and use fire greatsword elite to compensate for my small range (sword is close ranged and we can't switch mid range).
---
Others are situational:
---
If I need more damage, I will bring some extra damage utilities, if I need more stab or stun breaks, I usually grab armor of earth, more blocks I can bring most form, if I need another option for kiting, ice bow, if I need a minion to help me tank, I switch the elite, they are quite useful, and so on.
---
It's all about learning the situation and adapting to it and this works for any type of ele. Also, rotste your elements.
---
Done. Very nice survey in my opinion. My account name is Aluix.3946 :)
---
Thank you very much!   
---
Best of luck \\o/
---
Somewhere out there there could've been a "I only watch twitch because streamers are prohibited from uploading to YouTube for several days."
---
Raiders want one thing: more raids.  How is that harmful?
---
Non raiders who want to have an easier time get into raids want one thing: easy mode. How is that harmful?
---
 [My take on easy mode](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/chd1tf/how_did_we_get_here/eusx5rb/).
---
They had a long work day.
---
Sure, pm me your ign or discord, I'll add you. :3
---
I'll take that into consideration, thank you! Maybe i can mention this in the limitation part of my thesis
---
He never once said he was a noobie. He means while veterans leave he is returning. Just some guy trying to make a wholesome post and you low lifed it and publicized him as a fake noob. You're just as bad as modern day media.
---
Its not really the point of being good or bad. Imho its about having invested a lot of time into it or not. Sorry to say that, but I cant believe how u only can have 8k AP after 6 years. Even I dont care about AP much and are far over the 10k line. No offend, just wondering. Its just that my point is that I (and I think many others) use the word Veteran as something like "Beta Player", or in general for ppl who spend much time into it since years. In this case u can many times see this point by looking at the AP since u must have done dailies since a certain amount of time to get a certain amount of AP. Some lines cant get crossed anymore if u have not played this long. Also, AP gives u bonuses.
---
Thought the questions were pretty good for the topic.  Hope my data is useful.  Good luck with your thesis!
---
Katreyn.4218

Upvote the fuck out of this guy. He is a vet returning. There is no lie you fucks.
---
He never said he was a noob. He means he is a returning vet you fk. Stop making people look bad.
---
However, Khilbron did reanimate Rurik’s corpse and dragged him all the way to the Fire Islands where we defeated him. His physical body is long gone, it would be really cool to meet him as a spirit though!
---
100% agreed with this, but some peoples are still dellusional after all these years.
---
The game might not be dead, but can we say that it is alive ?
---
I am very glad to hear that, since it is always difficult to find fitting questionnaires for these topics. Thank you!
---
&gt; Guilds die out and new ones pop out all of the time.
---
So who replaced qT? Who replaced SC? Who replaced DnT?
---
With the current system in place, yeah you can. You can buy a WoW token and convert it into "Battle.net Balance" and buy Blizzard products with it. The problem with this, however, is that gold farming needs a healthy economy and I dont think WoW's economy is doing that well atm.
---
SC replaced qT. We’ll see who replaces SC.
---
DnT killed itself, not the game.
---
As a high elo veteran retired... boy...   
---
PvP is really well implement, it's just Arenanet absolutely abandoning it for no reason. They failed with ESL but they didn't learn from it, they just gave it away.   
---
Sad. Really sad.
---
I use Mixer these days instead of Twitch (just not a fan of ownership), but I'm sure I'm an odd one out here in the answers. I'm extremely anti-social and find larger stream chats to be totally cancerous, so I'll be an interesting statistic I'm sure. lol.
---
NazzyDragon.9127 -- hope more data helps. Good luck on your academic endeavors.
---
If it makes you feel better i have 22 stacks on an alt that looks like Yasuo from league, do with this knowledge what you will
---
As I said, those can be achieved in different ways. You can take mirage and finish the target your friend fails to kill or you can take holo/weaver and be frontline to stunlock the enemy (or keep them busy) so your friend can focus it easier. You can also take tempest/scrapper and keep your friend alive very long time. Lastly you could take thief so enemy cant expect a +1/cant escape very easily once they realize it's not just ranger they are fighting against.
---
Engi would probably be the most forgiving (tanky enough, but not necessarily the tankiest) build of all those, on either elite spec. Metabattle covers some decent builds for roaming.
---
I just want a class that makes a good use of the shield... I'm starting to regret my Flameseeker prophecy....
---
It is mostly because the raid scene is dead, though. In NA [meta], [iS], and [dP] all were planning on doing ERP at one point and all quit out of the ERP because the guilds disbanded/quit the game, not because we didn't have time for the tournament or anything. Like there literally just isn't hardcore raiding guilds in NA anymore, unless you consider like [Ren] or whatever hardcore, which would be hilarious.
---
Rurik died at the frost gate your right thats in Snowden or was not the North/Far Shiverpeaks. The Far Shiverpeaks are Eye of the North Areas. Even then you could argue he really died at the Ring of Fire Island Chain but thats up to you.
---
370
---
They’re not complaining. You guys are.
---
But why calculating all items? What's the point?
---
Conclusion from this research could be that gw2 store is much more developed? Or that average gw2 player is wealthier so buys more items in gw2 than wow? Or the blizzard have so much money that they don't need to bother with shop?
---
We're - you after 10k hours of playing.
---
That's easy. People around here like to help out and like how help is given to new players.
---
For survival, ranged like scepter or staff is much easier to survive when new
---
the arcane trait line has useful traits like arcane abatement, elemental attunement, and elemental contingency for boons/healing and attuenment recharge
---
fire trait line has useful traits burning on crit and blind when you burn
---
water has soothing mist and healing on dodge with flow like water trait
---
tempest trait line has harmonious conduit and unstable conduit with elemental bastion traits give auras/heal and stability on overload
---
weaver trait line has elemental refreshment and bolstered elements traits along with stone resonance and twist of fate to give barrier, stability, and more dodges
---
There's like 50 prompts...
---
Im just trying to figure out what happened? Used to be people that played games wanted to push the limit, see how far they could go, take on harder and harder enemies. Now its like gaming is all about logging in to see yourself on screen, flit around and dont really do anything. When did gamers become so ungamer like? Where are the gamers that would take hours to figure out a path or puzzle, where are the gamers that pushed to be better than their rivals, where are the gamers that delved into the lore and story of their game and followed it to the end. This new breed of games and gaming is some of the most trifling ever
---
Actually dealing with foefire and ghosts could be a great point plot. Maybe not now, maybe it requires its own story, but I'd love to see this happen. 
---
If ever gw3 comes out, and will show events from tyria again, we need world changing events. Joko is dead, awakened still live, sylvari are out there in numbers now, white mantle is most likely dis-mantled (heheheh). I want to see ascalon years after ghosts are gone.
---
Even for open world players the game is kind of dying, the last real jumping puzzle was pre PoF for example, and all living story maps are pretty much the same pointless nothingness with another environment skin put over it.
---
Gem store =/= content
---
I see it a lot in NA too. They try to hide it using teleports and stealth, but it's very easy to figure out what they are doing once you know what to look for.
---
horrible
---
I love gordon lmao can’t downvote you
---
No, it's relevant, since that is what prompted companies to add the warning, so they can claim in court they did everything possible to prevent injury, and thus be freed of potential liability.
---
If you buy a bottle of rat poison, it too will display the warning "Caution: Poison"....because if someone bought it, consumed it and got sick, they could sue in court that the manufacturer didn't reasonably warn the consumer the contents were poisonous...
---
This is why we have a world where the Kardashians have lots of money.

A lot of theos work looks like cantha

Depending on the question it might be an extreme case, but yeah, some people might be like that. Thank you a lot for participating!
---
Dat @55.
---
it was pretty highly upvoted and he is gilded.
---
You can’t it’s party time forever
---
Because 95% of peoples AP is dailies lol.
---
I imagine it can be pretty hard for new players to find the player amongst all the clones before they die :D Good to see you getting into the mode!
---
That's the confirmed no buy right there &gt;&lt;. Thanks though!
---
WvW is declining, but those who are screaming about the "sky is falling" are also not recognizing that we're in the end of summer.  A lot of GW2 players, like all MMOs, aren't playing because they instead are logging in to "Real Life".  
---
I'm not saying WvW doesn't have issues, but it isn't as bad as people say it is at this moment.  People will come back to it, and the game, for September.  Where it goes from there? We'll see.
---
To the OPs issues:  the mount is a pain because in order to get it, you need to be able to keep up with other players, at least for some of the components, namely flipping a tower and keep.  For that, my advice is just to play a high mobility class like LB Ranger + GS  + Owl or Daredevil + shortbow, at least until you can get to where a zerg is flipping either objective.  Everything else you can do solo, without requiring the mount.
---
Do the dailies for WvW potions to help complete the reward track.  Flipping camps, sentries, veteran creatures, etc can all be done on foot.  You'll get ganked more time than you'll enjoy, but according to the vocal minority, that is what WvW is for (or something).
---
EoTM is a ghost town, and probably only sees players looking for AP.  Even on reset nights, few servers see queues across all maps, so there is always a BL they can zone into.
---
There is no need to be so harsh. Not knowing about guild management is not equal to no knowledge at all.
---
OP's questions demonstrate thoughtfulness, care about other people, and desire to see things through. These should be encouraged, not ridiculed.
---
P.S. @OP: I think your post would receive better reception if it had better formatting and spelling.
---
Just done, was quite a detailed and nice survey. 
---
My account name is Leutrix.1295
---
I seriously can’t tell if this is a troll response or not.
---
On the off chance that it isn’t a troll response, what kind of games are you playing and/or who the hell are you playing with to believe all that?
---
Note that not only can zoom the map out, but there are multiple layers to many maps.  See the stacked horizontal lines in the bottom corner of the map?  Click on different of those lines to change the layer you’re looking at.
---
ok then make some.
---
No, but festivals, events, in-game obtainable armor skins, new maps, new raids, and new collections are very much content :)
---
if we’re just talking aesthetics, we just got 6 new armor sets on the last living story release. I’m guessing you unlocked all of them?
---
I think you misunderstood me. I meant that exploring stuff yourself is fun, not when the game just gives you every information every single second. Scrolling the map is not a rare feature of games, in fact it's something you can see playing every single game, so you have to be an absolute newbie to not know that, as OP seems to be. 
---
Also if someone new experiences some difficulties, it's awesome that the game itself forces such a person to search for help, that's what make community, and that's why people call it the friendliest community in games.
---
All they need to do is have the starter zone Scouts demonstrate this.  That should be enough to get new players up to speed.
---
Omg this is such a good idea, I’ll do that next time!
---
And the beginning of Kodan playable race, right?!
---
Thank you for this, I didn’t realize at first and couldn’t find my starting area so I had to go to Divinity’s Reach first
---
Anet said they were looking into the new ideas for Stronghold. I think if they updated the map to be a 10v10 it could work as a cool gvg map or something. You have 2 lanes, 5v5 on each, then you gather for tfs at the center for resources .. idk. 
---
We can only hope in the announcement they announce 2v2 queue or smth.
---
People said that about Old School Runescape, but now OSRS is more popular than the main game, *even if* you discount the bots. (Something pretty much every OSRS player is all too gleeful to remind RS3 players about at any given opportunity.)
---
Then again, Jagex has also been actively developing for OSRS since launch; they didn’t just plop down a backup from their archives, fix up some gamebreaking bugs, then say “here you go, enjoy, we’ll never add anything new though.”
---
So if they release Classic, patch it up, and keep adding new stuff (not necessarily a rehash of all the past updates, but add-ons unique to Classic, almost like a diverging timeline, like OSRS has done) then it might not be a flop. Though I also don’t have any reason to believe it’ll become more popular than “retail,” but it might be able to hold its own if ActiBlizz plays their cards right.
---
But Sylvan wasn't a word before Sylvari? Isn't that just the adjective, like Asuran?
---
Well that's fucking badass looking
---
This is an old thread, and no it isn't a sick post. It is a healthy post, I  was just asking a question. And this isn't insulting my thread doesn't answer my question.
---
They’ll still be a veteran in comparison to other new people, though.
---
I mean them people are going to leave anyway. 
---
You either let them burn out or force them out by turning off their gamemode for 2 weeks.
---
Well during the off season I am playing BDO, and trying out other games. There is at least some other people like me and maybe some of them will find another game that sticks and won't be back.
---
Balance patches in the off season would probably be enough for a lot of people to stick around and experiment with new builds. It always seemed a bizzarre change to me to do mid season.
---
Yeah. No one is razing your keep while you're sleeping. Just saying. Anet probably took a page or two from that fiasco.
---
Templates? But seriously though, I really miss GW1's minion necro.
---
I've seen only one deadeye flying and shooting people from the sky in all my 1600 games. Still, some hackers just use a small speedboost so you won't notice at all.  
---
Now speaking of bots... I've seen a lot and Anet doesn't seem to take actual care of this problem, there was a week when I had a match with a Mirage bot and everyone reported him, 2 days later I had that same bot in my team again. This kind of thing sucks because, how hard is to a GM take care of it?
---
LFR to Ascalon willing to pay.
---
Yea man...that's what I said some comments down the chain.
---
Got a ingame screen shot friend?
---
But that logic doesn't apply here.
---
Nothing is going to happen to your score while you sleep.
---
* Hard Mode.
---
* Zaishen Quests.
---
* Map Vanquishng (I'd like to have a version of that for large instances like Dungeons)
---
* Templates.
---
That is all.
---
If you need to be more precise, select what you want to interact with using your mouse, then press f.
---
You're reading into stuff that's not there mate, and are reaching pretty absurd conclusions. If I was satisfied with the game I'd be spend time in the game. I'm not, so I'm barely playing and when I am, content is near abandoned. 
---
Blame me for ANet's failure to deliver on their promises, sure. 
---
#6wingsperyear
---
oh man you and /u/PhoenixOfTheFire i ask you both what do you think reality is. do you know how an economy affects a company? do you realize how much real life and things completely outside of gw2 have directly affected the state of the game MORE than the internal decisions that come about as a result of reality? Like i said, if in 6 months Anet is still treating every game mode other than pve like utter and total shit, then i might agree with you that despite everything, anet doesnt care about those other modes. but we just got back to them working full steam ahead on gw2, which is literally not something the studio has done SINCE heart of thorns. have some patience before you start dragging everything down with your observations that go to about the edge of the maps you play in and then hard stop because you dont look at the real life reasons that things are the way they are. Do you really think a company from which not a single employee has complained about working in, would force their employees to do things they dont want to? do you really think they made raids and fractals because their families were being threatened and not for any other reason, like oh i dont know, because if they had the actual man power and green light from ncsoft, they would work on them more?
---
That’s so awesome! We need more Lionguard OCs.
---
Yeah. I would like to see the single F prompt replaced with a list of them with up to 8 entries. Putting at the top the most important priority ones. And putting as a 'sublist' those past 8 with the least priority and those that are the same (like picking one of many of the same bundle on the floor, or reviving a specific individual between stacked downed allies).  
---
Then, we could have 8 key bindings for the list, and we'd be be able to set the keys like this:
---
* F
---
* Ctrl+ F
---
* Alt + F
---
* Shift + F
---
* Ctrl + Alt + F
---
* Ctrl + Shift + F
---
* Alt + Shift + F
---
* Ctrl + Alt + Shift + F
---
Or click them in the list, if you are into that.
---
vanquishing would be the perfect new instanced 5 man content for gw2.
---
lmao my conclusion is that you absolutely arent satisfied, you troll. stop dragging your feelings along and ignoring the real world reasons that things happen. go play another game instead of spewing about how everything is worse in gw2 because you dont get content as quickly as you would like to. your ignorance is going to give me ulcers
---
It’s fine you talk about an incidence but putting an over encompassing title is rude and simply untrue. I submitted a ticket and pixie was more than helpful. Please fix your title you are undermining and generalizing ALL work.
---
There's a couple raid mechanics like that (Cairn's Shared Agony), but nothing that players can inflict on each other.
---
Hey Arenanet? You want to provide an answer to groups stacking as tightly as possible on top of one another? Here's your answer. Let us spread diseases once again!
---
Can just run Arcane shield and Earth shield and that should be plenty of survivability, at the cost of only two utility skills. Just use the arcane block first then followed by the earth shield for protection when the blocks expire for really solid defense, and fill cd times for those skills with dodges and heal skill
---
We can hope!
---
Again, you're reading into shit that's not there. And the 'Go play another game!' stuff is exactly part of why this situation started lmao.
---
hexes
---
There wasn't much endgame at launch as they launched about six months early. *Orr wasn't even released as a zone.* We were all just busy leveling so it wasn't as annoying.
---
Being able to do more than 1 pvp game mode.
---
2nd professions (would be too broken in gw2 tho)
---
Having a choice of a LOT more skills.
---
Hiding energy in pvp was always fun.
---
You're taking everything too personally and putting your own twist on it. How do you get all this from a single sentence comment? Ever heard of logical fallacies and putting words into someone's mouth? Might be worth reading up on.
---
After the last few years' of Anet's disinvestment in their own game, it is in some trouble, especially in a few game modes. It's not about to shut down but they do need to turn some things around to retain long-term players.  
---
(About 13000 hours over the last 7 years, it'd be more but I took a few sabbaticals over the years due to cancer. My current main game mode is WvW. I love the mount but we need more love.)
---
&gt;Bro, fucking path of exile gives ingame cosmetics to ppl each season for playing the game. The f2p arguement doesnt hold ground here, anet is just greedy.
---
So does GW2. Are the LW Map Achievement skins not the same thing? What about the Elegy, Requiem, Dragonsblood, Heroic Dragonsblood, Mist Shard, and Blossoming Mist Shard sets?
---
Pvp is a joke, back when season 1 launched you had to be above 2000 rating wouldn't even put you in top 250. Now all you need is shit tier plat, and bam you are already top 150 on the leader board.
---
Creates clones... Oh no
---
What about glider and mount skins? What about any actually good looking weapon sets? Every black lion set is 10 times better then the weapons pvp and wvw got this week.
---
Every outfit, skin and armor in the gemstore looks    x tomes more polished and cool than the stuff we get in game. And they get that like every other week.
---
The deck-building nature of skills.  For those that never played: you could choose all 8 skills - they weren't tied to weapon - and there was a huge suite to choose from.  You could also dual class and thus take skills from a second profession.  Builds were all about finding a set of skills with great synergy, and typically revolved around which Elite skill you chose (could only have one.)  Come Nightfall you could bring along NPCs that you could fully customize, so then it became a game of building a "deck" of the right classes with the right skills to get synergy across your whole party.
---
For example: paragons had a shout that reduced enemy damage from foes on fire, so you could bring an ele with an AoE burning elite.  But that paragon also has a shout that makes allies next hit crit, and that works on minions, so you bring a minon master.  And actually that AoE burning elite applies burning first but does crazy damage if they already are burning, so you take a second ele with that skill.  Oh and that crit shout has no limit on number of allies, so you might as well take a ritualist that summons and bunch of offensive spirits.  AND assassins get energy back when they crit so you could take one of those.  Oh and those minions die a lot so might as well make one of your healers a necro/rit since they get energy when something dies nearby.  Then you just need a monk and you're golden.
---
That's just ONE setup out of so many possibilities.  It was endless content and GW2 simply has nothing like it.
---
Being able to dye my weapons :(
---
It's not like they can do much about them. Support has no power to delete items from your account.
---
I see way more people say the game is not dying, people who circle jerk anet to defend a game they like. 
---
That games in a shit state mate, join us in reality.
---
Nothing is forever, everyone will die at some point, so will the game. There is no point in telling people to stop saying things, as well.
---
that just seems redundant. why not just right click on the thing you want to interact with if youre going to have to use your mouse at all? it defeats the purpose of the interact key.
---
Running to the LA bank and pressing F only to see that theres some stupid neutral NPCs walking around that get in the way that you talk to instead. rage
---
While we are at it, please for the love of 6 give us an option to disable “greet” . It’s really aggravating when you trying to access TP or Bank, you get random NPC screaming “I’m rich YOU know!” “May Kormir guide you!!!”instead.
---
 Also there shouldn’t be an F option for other player’s personal TP or bank npc to begin with. Some troll deliberately summon them to block AB meta chests. Other troll blocks like box of fun or bubble head are easy to avoid, but not for personal tps.
---
I'm imagining a 5 man instance of every zone specifically designed for vanquishing. But instead of just killing all the enemies like in GW1, I'm picturing something like; you need to succeed specific event chains and kill a set number of bosses throughout the zone.
---
Pvp population is super dead.
---
There was a time where pvp rating of 2100 wouldn't even put you in top 250. These days all you need is a pvp rating of about 1650 and you are already in top 250 of the players. 
---
1700 And you are already top 100.  
---
1723 And you are already in top 50.
---
It is bad.
---
Sry, but game dying...
---
Holy shit.
---
Taseful color palette.
---
Sensible armor while still having fantasy elements.
---
Dandy goddam Bluster?!
---
Goes without saying the artist is amazing, but I just I'm equally amazed at seeing some _restraint_ from a commissioner. A+
---
31g/hr is probably on the high end.
---
The main means of gold-making is the champs after the Meta-Event, each champ drops 3 coffers, and each coffer is about like half a g or more each. But you need keys
---
Here's some tips: 
---
**Pre-Meta** Pretty much what you want to do is tag as many events as possible for keys. If somebody announces a mender (they drop 3 keys and 3 chests), get there asap. 
---
Consume Mistborn Motes to get VM, and spend that VM on a Trophy crate, it's 250 VM + 1g per crate, and each crate will get you \~1.5g if you sell the mats.
---
I'll give you the point in Mount and Glider skins. The quality of BL weapons, outfits, and armor though are entirely subjective. I personally like most of the in game armor over the BL stuff, but that is my subjective opinion.
---
My main point though is that the perceived quality of BL vs in game sins is entirely subjective based on each players tastes, not something an objective argument can be made from
---
yeah it has to be somewhat static and not with active event chains
---
thats not fixing thats just a tldr of every teatime...
---
Resource starved.
---
not sure what should i be looking at

&gt; I mean does it matter though? They can choose to not play for the first 2 weeks of the new season if you want a break, You need 10 games to be placed anyway.
---
For ranking placement? Yes. For leaderboard placement? Not so much.
---
Meow. Just meow &lt;3

I'll agree on everything but Braham, he's literally the poster child of bad writing and only in the last episode did he begin to be redeemed.
---
Reddit is literally a place for discussing things lmao. This entire thread is made as a discussion. If I see some obvious flaws in logic, I'll respond to them.
---
You can read my comment history all you want, I don't just come here to talk shit. It's just important that the games flaws are brought to attention as well. The entire situation this subreddit is in is caused partially due to a ton of people here dismissing all criticism with 'go play another game'. It's why people are more and more negative, constructive criticism falls on deaf ears or gets you labelled as toxic elitist.
---
They got their wish though, the hardcore raiding community is quitting after the 24th and going to WoW classic or FFXIV, WvW is waiting for Crowfall and Camelot unchained and many PvP players are moving on to actual competitive games.
---
I see you have your opinion and I have mine. Reading my entire post history and getting extremely worked up over it is completely unrelated to the comment chain here though. You're literally reading into stuff that's not the comment you're responding to.
---
Wait they implied Menzies dies off screen?
---
I hate that I don't find that hard to believe.
---
Awesome
---
I suggested it a long time ago. When there's a downed ally and downed enemy and flame ram near you and we set keybinds to:
---
 
---
* F interact and pay respects
---
* G resurrect
---
* C finish
---
* J use siege weapon
---
there would be 3 pop-ups in the style we have at the moment. G starts the typical massage, C starts finishing, F would start an action according to priority res-&gt;finish-&gt;interact.
---
At least you can dye the glow of gemstore skins, unlile cough cough legendary armor cough cough
---
Personal tp/merch/bank shouldn't even spawn an NPC, just open the God damn window, what is even a point of those...
---
Why not just making seasons back to back? GW2 is not esports, never will be, off seasons make no sense. Why giving players any more reasons not to play the game?
---
Having heroes to do everything. Imagine doing raids with just heroes.
---
I think he's simply being told what to do and he plays along with management.
---
It used to be a gem, now it's just a store
---
expansions, heroes and mesmer
---
Not according to the wiki
---
Roy wearing them actually might ;p
---
When you are in the middle of an engagement that includes multiple allies and enemies in WvW or PvP there is often not enough time to play point and click with your mouse. 
---
  
---
The most annoying thing that happens is when there's a downed enemy on top of your downed ally, and you are trying to res your ally. You click on them, but instead select the enemy. You try to click again to select your ally, and the game thinks you double clicked your enemy, so you start finishing instead...
---
I miss the brain game... the “Build Wars” days that made Guild Wars so alive!

Dual classing, build templates

IIRC the 5 limit didn't exist at launch and was set because of wvw aoe usage being op. Now anet behaves as if it was always an intended limit for pve and it utterly makes sense, even says pushing something to 10 instead of 5 must be done carefully because of performance (but performance was apparently not an issue at all during development without a limit at all ... then again the limit requires doing quite a lot of chests and prioritization).
---
gw2 still have interrupts on paper but it's by far not as good a in gw1
---
hard mode
---
class specific idle animations
---
People who post on the gw2 forums are an even bigger minority than hardcore pvers. You shouldn't take anything on there seriously when they complain about everything, anet could give us everything we ever wanted and they would still find something to complain about there because its what they do. Actual vets who play the game weren't complaining about EotM rewards, and I doubt a couple posts by people who were complaining just to complain were the reason that the rewards in eotm are less than regular wvw.
---
As many others have said, I really miss heroes.  They tied in so well with the deck building mechanics of GW1 skills, and it was just nice to always run with a group.  Open world pve would be so much better as a solo player with heroes.
---
It would be nice if they would at least work on the support wells.  
---
Have them pulse around you while you move (similar to Gyros which are now "wells") and enhance their abilities. For example, have precog give an additional buff like barrier based on healing power.  
---
Support wells are easily one of the worst abilities since it requires you to stand there until the end until you get most of the boons (or return to it for the last pulse). It just doesn't work well in WvW or PvP at all...
---
&gt; Blackout was superior to stun.
---
And the fact that you couldn't re-stun something that was already stunned. GW2 gets rly annoying with cc-lock.
---
This is the kind of art I appreciate here. Nicely done.

you clearly didnt read the page i linked, 20% of the users will use sites for example as reddit/youtube /gw2effiency/gw2facebook/gw2forum, while only 5% of those will post and or comment
---
As I said, F2P games always end up a rip off for players who care about cosmetics.
---
I gladly pay subs.
---
The single F2P game where I felt the cash shop was fair and you still gained most cosmetics through the game was Guild Wars 1 and it's pretty clear this "sequel" is a pale shadow of its predecessor in design practices and has completely abandoned its principles.
---
BEST IDEA EVER
---
This is perfect. Anyone who uses those gaudy atrocious angel wings should be perma banned.
---
ah, yes but its not the only way. as in the same conversation the Commander tells Logan that with the crown he was able to put some ghosts to rest.
---
    Talk more option tango.png
---
    He also found what he thought were magical words.
---
        But all of that wasn't enough. And now he's gone through a portal to gods know where. If it weren't Rytlock, I'd be more worried.
---
        Talk end option tango.png
---
        It is Rytlock. He'll be back. I just hope he comes back in one piece.
---
    The charr are the true victims of that curse.
---
        There have been many victims of that curse. I'm frankly surprised Rytlock's ritual did anything at all.
---
        Talk more option tango.png
---
        And yet, it did. It affected some of the ghosts present. They're gone.
---
You saw this? With your own eyes? That's remarkable. Amazing! It means there's hope. With the right mix of components, we can free the spirits of Ascalon forever. The charr with then be freed as well.
---
Op is FARMING that negative karma holy
---
On topic: raids and fractals are dying, pvp is on its last breath, wvw is full dead. That’s not a healthy game, even if queensdale looks fine to you.
---
There are several nice looking armor sets-- well, the shoulders can be iffy, but that's what mixing and matching is for.
---
What is your WvW rank?
---
Hinting a living world season that has already ended. There's little to no lore updates on this festival.

Well, they just released a new patch right now that fixes a crash, so maybe try again?

The shots from your rifle travel 50% faster (e.g., 150 units per second, instead of 100 units per second when standing).

I'd say it's either one of your addons (if you use any) or a graphics driver issue.
---
Screw HA. Elitists took over that entire game mode and made it virtually inaccessible to anyone who didn't play since day one. It's the same crap we have now with Raids in GW2. People holding content hostage because they think they're somehow better than everyone else. HA was only being run by a small percentage of players until it became overrun by bots. Now everyone is just farming ranks.

What race and gender? I can give some suggestions
---
Was a teaser for LS4 episode 4, since the festival was just before that.
---
Probably already downloaded since you can't start the game without being on the latest version. If you press F11 ingame and look at the bottom left it should say Gw2: 98,656 as the build number
---
Human male!
---
Will do thank you!
---
Disease only spread to creatures of the same type, so GW2's race diversity would actually hinder its effectiveness in an interesting way.
---
TIL. Appreciate the info.

Here's

In my opinion: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline\_Blade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline_Blade)
---
playing for obtain skins.... i think it was the reason why i play soo much at gw1, and i think is a kind of think that we lost in gw2... look for example fractals , or mosto of the open world event... we just play to make money to buy gems to buy skins... it just soo antifun... i remember do FoWsc soo many times for the obsidian edge and even if i never dropped a perfect ones i dropped others cool skins... or the silverwing bow ffs frostmaw was really a good dungeons and it was great play different type of content (uw , fow , urgoz , kanaxay , doa , dungeons , specific boss) for a chanche to obtain something; of course you have the possibilities to just bought weapon/minis if you had enough ecto , but the fact that ppl played the content where there was a specific skins they like was at least for me a good way to give replayability to all type of content.. a thing that we lost with gw2... ppl to sivewastes or dragonfall just cos money ... and it's soo sad..

Damn, that was savage.

Each individual class and gender had a unique dance!

They banned players near the launch of the game for their own mistake in pricing items on a vendor.
---
Damn, best content ever put out in this sub this year.
---
* Hard Mode
---
* Guild vs Guild
---
* Vanquishing
---
* Zaishen daily quests
---
* Tons of synergy and builds
---
* Hex/condition mechanic
---
I will settle for 55jp monkey
---
Okay, let me put my whole argument another way, because some people seem to have lost it in the shuffled. Even if you're right, and I don't believe you are (because Orr was one of the places Anet claimed was their end game), with the Temple events and all, here's my issue in general with a lot of what I'm reading in this thread. I'll break it down into steps.
---
1. A new player comes in and posts that veterans are leaving as he's starting to play.
---
2. I'm a veteran who's not leaving in a guild filled with veterans who are not leaving. I know other veterans not in my guild who also aren't leaving.
---
3. This new guy, from reading reddit believes that the bulk of the veterans are leaving, which I don't believe. He believes the game might even be dying or in dire straits and if he doesn't other people from reading reddit certainly will.
---
4. I post suggesting that not all vets are leaving and some of us are satisfied. I believe this to be more than half of the vets, and probably a lot more than half, because I don't think most vets raid or focus on PvP or WvW.  Some do, obviously and even some of those aren't leaving. There's a guy in my guild who's like level 4000 in WvW who's perfectly fine with the format and still enjoying his time there. This isn't something I'm making up, he's a friend of mine. I talked to him about WvW and mentioned there were a lot of complaints. He said he doesn't listen to them, because he's having fun. He just doesn't care.  So I feel that a counterpoint is okay. That a percentage of people are dissatisfied and leaving but it's not more than is the percentage of people who aren't dissatisfied. That is casual PvPers and WvWers can still enjoy that game mode...and there are still a bunch of people like that.
---
I guess it just seems to me that some people are unhappy with the game and they want everyone to know the game is bad somehow, or dying and whatever they want to say.  I want to say I believe this argument is overstated and you can still have hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun with this game. I want to offer a counterpoint to the myriad voices raised loudly, convincing people like the OP that the game is dying or not worth starting.
---
Which if you people starting another game today will guarantee me that when you spend the same number of hours you've spent here in that new game, you won't sound the same over there?
---
This is, and has been my argument all along.
---
People who want harder content want to insult me, because I don't care that much about it or my level of challenge is different. I don't want to insult them because I understand they are hurting. They're not getting the support they feel they deserve.
---
But that doesn't mean I'm not entitled to a counter point.
---
If 20% of the playerbase are the type of player that are leaving because there's not enough hard content, it means 80% aren't. If 30% are leaving because they want harder content, then 70% aren't. 
---
Don't I still have a right to talk to those people? Talk about my end game? An end game that Anet themselves used in shows over and over for a year before they ever spoke about PvP at all? 
---
They didn't go to shows talking about dungeons. They went to shows and talked about dynamic events and a living breathing world, over and over again.  That's what this game has always been focused on. They didn't continually come out with new hard content. They made new events. They made living world...pretty much all along. 
---
Anet wanted to focus on a living breathing world and for years that's what most expansion supported. Some of us play that game, and that's okay too. Us saying that that game is okay is fine. 
---
You want to say this end game is real end game, and this is what was intended, but in reality, Anet has said otherwise. Why are you so sure you're right about this, when Anet went to shows talking about the three Orr zones as end game?
---
Secret cow level confirmed
---
There are 2 people working on both spvp and WvW so he is starved for resources.
---
It's a cow lost from Fields of Ruin back during season 3 after the Bloodstone explosion created rifts all over Tyria.

they could make "pick 3 instabs for bonus 3 encryptions" and "5 for bonus 6" "7 for bonus 10" etc
---
I agree and it messes up boss code/workings/animations/etc 
---
But it also buffs us and thats at least something good

Almost all of them already have "Karma", only social awkwardness and vindicators that doesn't have any possible good effect.

but a lot of the Good/Bad are shit balanced.

30% less health for 25% move speed is shit when people already have it from potion.

I'd prefer coffee, thanks.
---
The entire premise.
---
"what gw1 mechanics do you miss from gw2?"
---
Everybody knows that the only reasonable thing to do in front of a gate with a downed ally and enemy is to grab the ram and try to ram your ally.
---
That's why this is the default action.

Trying to test the pulse of WvW population after the post-mount exodus?
