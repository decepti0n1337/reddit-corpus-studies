yeah and gold farming bots in pvp and multiboxing is perfectly fine. give me a fucking break
---
---
---
it was a very very well thought out guide, but 100g/h DONT POST THAT SH!T ON REDDIT XD just keep it to yourself.
---
I'm confused by it all truth be told, i pop into Hoelbrak, looked around, popped a few pinata's and could really see anything else to do and left.
---
Please don't make me go back to The Grove :( I get lost every time!
---
After the rage inducing levels of tangled depths the grove is like navigating a step stool.
---
imagine doing dungeons in 2019
---
I was making a point about grinding yourself into hating something. The faster you try to get everything the worse it becomes. You dont have to rush to get everything done as fast as possible.
---
That's my biggest annoyance (or one of them at least) with the game design, this isn't an issue with just the festival but any event in lower level zones, and it only got worse with the addition of mounts/power creep. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A few days ago we had a daily event completer in queensdale, the character I was leveling could barely tag anything in the events because all the max level people will instantly kill anything even if they just auto attack. 
---
My suggestion when it comes to the current festival though: 
---
\- I'm a level 80 and I can barely tag anything in the holo stampede as well, I settled for just hitting one or two nodes that are close to WPs. 
---
\- You can do the regular arena with any character you want, it will upscale you to level 80 when inside of it. I would advise against the survival mode though, I think that one fits lv80 better. 
---
\- If you want to, you can unlock the raptor even without using a booster. Get a friend to do the story instance and teleport to them, you complete a heart in the story to "purchase" the raptor.  I've seen people sometimes offering this in the starter zones.
---
playing the tp and farming the players by selling raids etc.
---
Dungeon tours are still a thing? They used to be one of my favorite things to do ingame before Anet nerfed the rewards, whenever I try to form a group for a path it takes way too long to fill.
---
Sylvari = Mordremoth Memorial Day
---
We are all the Jungle Dragon‚Äôs children!
---
Rep vendors = resetting heart vendors  
---
Rep grinds = map currency grinds 
---
We have these functions covered already
---
It's Bartholomew Cubbins!
---
That‚Äôs because Mordremoth is inside all of us!  The Jungle Dragon loves you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
even if anet would care
---
they have now way of detecting someone reading in the game file and extracting stuff
---
all you do is done offline
---
*If Mordremorth could attack our high quality armor then we should go to the armory brought to you by the consortium*
---
So like karma but requires more grinding ... or basically vendors that sell stuff for a lot of karma
---
Yea i guess you are right, never thought of it like that.
---
None of the other farms require skill though. Or are fun.. Or engaging.
---
My guess is because people who don't play gw2 hear/see the word fashion more often than raids when refering to gw2.
---
I‚Äôm using it as an example to show the lack of ethics the council has, through how they don‚Äôt regulate the inquest. Look at high councillor flax. It says literally on the wiki that he‚Äôll do anything to promote the asura as superior to any other race. And when the councillor sabotaged the golems, she was trying to kill all the other councillors with them to establish her control over rata sum, and afterwards nobody cared and she was still allowed to be a councillor. Nobody in the council has any ethics. If the council gave a rats ass about ethics in rata sum, then the inquest would‚Äôve been shut down a long time ago.
---
People who say that play other MMOs where dungeons/raids are the main thing to do at max level, so they see that as endgame. The problem is trying to address people who say that is, in my experience, futile. Endgame is just something you can do at max level and GW2 has a ton of it. Its just not the same thing as other MMOs and its why people keep saying that.
---
Not a bad theory.
---
It lets you fly and is incredibly mobile. I would say this particular mount is an elite mount.
---
Wow, fuck man the asuran society seems messed up. Anything for science I suppose, I need to make an asuran
---
And is that still available if I delete the character?
---
Exactly.
---
Yes. The wardrobe is separate from characters.
---
But, as noted you still need transmutation charges to reskin gear. (easy to get)
---
Or buy em for 53g on the tp lol
---
Last I checked Farming is never supposed to be enjoyable? People like you already make sure of that every time one shows up, now we can't have unenjoyable farms either.
---
***Farm is fun and enjoyable, requires no skill***
---
Lake Doric Turret Farming, Istan
---
"all they do is press 1 to get money, get this out of here"
---
***Farm requires skill, is "unenjoyable" A.k.a Effort = Money*** ***^((like it should be supposedly, see above))***
---
Fractal 40, Fractal 61
---
"not fun, get rid of it, this is hideous to new players"

***Farm is silverwastes, which people have been doing for \*\*\*literal\*\*\* years***

---
AB multi loot is still a thing? I thought it got nerfed ages ago. I'm just returning to the game so a little rusty.
---
The sad moment when you realize that they do the same thing with class balance.
---
Tell them it is a bit late for that sort of cross promotion :p
---
Just curious, how much would it cost me to buy just the raid achievements? Do you know?
---
I like GW2 because the whole thing is basically endgame since levelling isn't nearly as much of a goddamn chore. It's like puberty for your character, a few days of PvP and World Comp too see if you like how a class plays.
---
In other MMOs the gameplay is 90% levelling
---
It doesn't have a traditional end game. People think PvE end game must be raids. You'll never convince them otherwise, because it's how they were raised in the genre. Telling them that there are other forms of end game, often falls on deaf ears. 
---
But if you were to try, you could describe collections, and the giant open world meta events like dragon stand, and compare it to an open world raid.
---
There was a big detailed post on this about a week ago
---
Are boon chronos still in high demand for Tier 4 fractals?  Or is it more common that people run a renegade and firebrand combo to provide alactrity and quickness?
---
They'll just bring up how we never had Mr.T and Chuck Norris in our trailers :(
---
I don't want 40 new currencies.
---
GW2 just have a different endgame than traditional MMOs.
---
Completely agree. They've had so many opportunities to bring them back with all the instanced areas we've gotten in Living World that get used for a single chapter then never touched again. 
---
Instead of abandoning dungeons for raids, they should have abandoned fractals for raids (it already has it's own lobby and independent story). All of the current raid areas would have been much better served as dungeons.
---
This is exactly what is going to happen. I spoke to a dev during the wait for a stampede event about the events scaling, and he said that any changes that they would make would happen for next years festival.
---
Dunno why you got downvoted. Every time you buy something you get a free transmutation charge for that item and honestly unless you change your look every 7 days you‚Äôll probably be fine
---
&gt; Caps aren't the issue, its the amount of loot gained before you hit it that's the problem. 
---
That's... What I'm saying... The reason why the cap is the issue, is because the cap is so low.
---
Thank you for basically saying "you're wrong about the issue, the issue is exactly what you said!"
---
&gt;which was the reward for finishing HOT.
---
I‚Äôm a bit confused here, does Griffion require anything from HoT in order to be unlocked?
---
yes they time gated this fractal only
---
Dragon Stand at Dragon's Domain, at the top of the tower! :)
---
Not HoT, PoF. You have to finish the PoF story. I had a brain fart. My advice to you...don't get old.
---
AH YES OF COURSE! Please tell me more about how fun and engaging it is to circle the Silverwastes and press 11111. This is still the only viable farm after what feels like 10 years, everything that came close to it was nerfed into the ground. In all honesty, I'd rather convert gems to gold than spent more than 1 minute on that disgusting map.
---
Oh why yes ofcourse I‚Äôll just *stop* aging, who needs a fountain of youth anyways
---
NO N
---
NO NO NO! w
---
NO NO
---
NO NO NO! WE SHOULD GO TO THE ARMORY!
---
1) don't be afraid to try out combinations of weapons and skills. There are no wrong choices at your level, and you unlock everything by level 80. Although, learn the difference between power and condition damage
---
2) hearts are often boring, and don't give enough exp to make them worth it. Do events and exploration to level up
---
3) find a guild for in game support and help, r/guildrecruitment is a great resource for that
---
4) read up on defiance bars, you'll need them later and the game isn't good at explaining them
---
5) never be afraid to ask for help!
---
Aquatic Ruins farming? Didn't even know it was such a thing. How soon until they do the same to 42 farm now??
---
Never share this stuff. No surprise here.
---
I appreciate that thank you!!! I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs not a full on toxic community. What is the difference between the damages
---
RIP just as I was about to try it too
---
I dont get it at all. There are 7 raid wings, hard cms like dhuum, and wvwvvw.
---
Okay, so I‚Äôm not 100% sure on what build I‚Äôm using and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really one because I just use what stuff I like. I was using a staff most of this time because I like the aoe attacks but I‚Äôm going to switch to a great sword. I normally use minions to attack and distract enemy‚Äôs but I‚Äôve switched some out for healing and damage
---
Yep! Got it! I feel like I don‚Äôt spend much time looking at my gear so I need to do that. Thank you!
---
I might buy HoT and try that! And a glider seems like a lot of fun!
---
That's quality graphic card.
---
Thx will check it out! ^^
---
Mallyx would be crazy on Scourge. All the condi transfers and resistance, yikes.
---
But I just realised I need HoT to be able to do that lol
---
Take a look at the value of wintersday gifts and trick or treat bags. Assume the coffers will stablize just above those. Possibly dipping below around week three.
---
The price will then spike again near the end of the event, as one group of people expect the faucet to end, then it will crash just after the event ends, as another group who saved all their coffers offloads them prematurely. It will then climb back up steadilly over the course of six months or so, every time it looks like it might be really going up for good, it will dip again as more people dump supply back on the market.
---
Predictable as it may be, these things are not usually profitable without careful and considered monitoring of the market for months at a time. Just sell now while they are worth something.
---
If that's the case, then record and report the player.
---
Uh btw i did this run now 191 times \\√º/
---
Thank you, that's just what I needed.
---
Because it's not a hard achievement. It's more tedious than difficult.
---
I started out with an engi. It's still my main and I've got it set up as a rough holosmith condi pistol build with heal turret, grenades, flamethrower, slick shoes, and prime light beam. I still barely feel like I know what I'm doing. I spam holosmith, use it for damage and then heat therapy and an overcharged prime light beam, then cycle through the pistols, grenades, and flamethrower. I'll go to the flamethrower first if I notice they already have lots of burning because more fire good I guess? I don't know how to use combos because there are so many to memorize, and I can barely see them let alone react fast enough to use them. I do ok but there are still times in the story where I get killed even with good armor and trinkets that boost my condi damage. Idk how to wrap my head around the deeper combat systems. I also have a revenant, thief, and mesmer but I most of the time im just spamming shit with them and hoping it works. Any advice?
---
well either way full minstrel is too much thanks to the fb traits
---
I think everyone is forgetting that the fractal farm was (supposedly) 100g/he, which is insane when most other things in the game only hit 15-20g/hr.
---
I don't think any farm should be 5x over everything else.
---
Yes, but i would not advise to run full minstrel if you don't want to pull aggro. And don't forget you have always +250 toughness due to [Imbued Hast](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Imbued_Haste).
---
&gt; Can bring minstrels in a raid or is there a mix of harrier+minstrels that will let not pull aggro? 
---
For some encounter boss aggro is not toughness dependent, but if the encounter you are playing is, you have to ask the intended tank how much toughness he/she got and adjust. 
---
General speaking low toughness is meta. There for harrier gear is better for raiding but for WvW i don't know.
---
Just make armor and weapons of one type and two sets of trinkets.
---
I personally play my healing firebrand with harrier + magi, to not over cap concentration in side fractals.
---
Had a proper reply typed out but we obv not understanding each other. So il just say it quick. U can believe what u like, but ik personally iv dropped asc from some of the worst mob bags in the game, like others can probably say too. If OP got it from the coffer, he got it from the coffer, u cant change that fact. So in short: il stick what to ik and u can take it or leave it - any pve loot bag can drop asc. There is no "limitations or restrictions".
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm kind of lost üòÇ I‚Äôve played gw2 a lot but I mainly did map completion and that was way before all the new dlc came out. I‚Äôm trying to do it again and I‚Äôm just lost on the rest of the stuff because I‚Äôve never worried about it üòÇ
---
Thank you! Doing it now
---
the posters got the most out of it, what drug are you on
---
Okay cool! Thank you for the tip! I‚Äôm not use to dealing with enemys that are stronger than me so I never really played with any of that stuff. It‚Äôs probably why I suck so much at actually playing the game now
---
maybe you‚Äôre joking maybe not, but personally for me silverwaste makes me want to rip my hair out. Mount up raptor go to an event skill1, run away or burst mobs down, raptor up, next event and eun the map in circles. I really hate it. Yeah I‚Äôm making money but farming gold is never and probably never will be fun, i farmed crests though. Maybe raid selling is fun? idk
---
Every time I decide to finish TD map completion and join an HP for simplicity's sale, I think "this map isn't actually that bad, I should explore here more often!" Then every time I come back by myself and get stuck trying to figure out which bloody level the missing POIs are on, I decide not to go back for another year.
---
I've joined a map after the meta was completed and was able to loot chests so you are incorrect.
---
Once you know the fights, it's not difficult to tank as a firebrand and it's even meta on a couple of bosses. That being said, I can't recommend you to try it. You should definitely listen to the other advice given and get a harrier set in order to avoid being the tank. Then you can run around and res people that get downed in random places without dragging the boss around with you.
---
A note that you absolutely need to keep in mind when you're raiding: When you're comparing toughness with the tank, you absolutely can't forget about the trait that gives you toughness when you have quickness.
---
TL;DR no.
---
They really should change that trait so it grants power instead of toughness when under quickness effects.
---
Proper dungeons require people to know alot more about GW2s combat system, how to take advantage of how NPCs are coded, secondary effects of skills on your class, trait swapping, proper movement from boss to boss.
---
GW2 Raids are require you to know the skills on your bar, and the mechanics that you deal with. Thats it. Imagine thinking raids are hard, even more so to someone who literally won a tournament about raids.
---
If you think I'm wrong I'd love for you to come on a tour, I'll count your mistakes. Mail me @Grimjack.8130 :)
---
That's why I don't like to post videos of anything cool on reddit anymore. Cya OG method of triple jump, cya superjump macro springer. Fuck sakes.

I mean with the Skyscale you can literally avoid anything, watch them put flying enemies to fuck with flying players into the next season / episodes.

If it's for your story you can do that one solo.

You there, you look useless.
---
Part of why people in WoW look down on gw2 endgame is because, even if fractals and raids look similar to WoW mechanics, there isn‚Äôt very much truly challenging content in this game. Fractals and raids are actually quite faceroll once you know the mechanics, which is different from WoW and FF games as I understand it.
---
Fashion wars/~~sometimes WvW~~. 
---
The only end game.   
---
In all honesty, we can call T4 fractals CMs, Raids etc all endgame, but they're doable to the point that you can run exotic gear (if agony wasn't required for fracs this would still be true), half ass it and still get away with completing it. That's the endgame. There's a big discrepancy between what a group of really skilled players can do, and what is required to complete anything in the game.   
---
Performing really really well only serves to clear the fractal/raid. That's it. 
---
Speed running them, doing them solo etc serves no game given purpose. Some people consider that their endgame, being able to solo, low man, speedrun things, however there is literally ZERO incentive to do these things other than personal satisfaction and bragging rights.   
---
When it comes to actually killing new things in the game, with no gear treadmill required, it's basically a skill treadmill, except a large portion of the players who are good at the game, get nothing from being that good other than the aforementioned, personal satisfaction.
---
Gear treadmills, in general, allow the entire player base to work towards some sort of progression that will allow them to be able to clear the "next hardest thing" even if they stay at the same skill level. GW2 however, does not have this gear upgrade, thus the only way to provide something "harder" to kill or defeat is by increasing difficulty of the encounter.
---
The problem with this (as much as I would enjoy that) is that it gets to the point where the casuals simply won't try it as "it's too hard" for them, hence dividing the playerbase. In the end Anet is still a business, you also don't want to be making content that only a small portion of your playerbase plays. If the person who wants to play this game wants an endgame, they must be derive their satisfaction for playing the game from either, fashion, or skill. The short lived satisfaction of attaining ascended and legendary armor eventually wanes for many, funnily enough, many people play for that and that again is kind of like a gear treadmill. 
---
Now, there is not really a set way of "improving" a player's performance. Grinding a bit to purchase higher level gear is a different story altogether, as it is usually more a timegate than a skillgate. Something which only takes time will likely include the majority of the playerbase allowing them eventually obtain that gear and upon completion be somewhat satisfied in completing the "latest hardest thing". On the other hand, building the entire playerbase's skill is something that is much more difficult.   
---
Anet's solution? Introduce new mechanics. Since Bloodstone Fen, Anet seem to have been introducing both raid and fractal mechanics in open world including set moves of monsters with the same damage indicators etc. This allows them to reuse mechanics and assets whilst also helping to bridge the gap between the casual and slightly more skilled players. Ok, that sounds good right? Yea it kinda does, what's the problem then? 
---
In open world mechanics are not punishing enough. People just get 50 people and zerg spam 111 everything down without a second thought of mechanics since they simply outheal it. Result: no one learns anything and spams 1 and a few skills maybe? That's it. At the same time, if you make something really punishing, hardly anyone completes open world activities for a bounty/meta event's mediocre, and lacklustre rewards. See the issue? Make something too hard and only a small percentage are skilled enough to actually complete and play it, make something too easy, there's nothing to do after braindead pressing auto attack.
---
Solution? Either, you bridge difficulty better, or introduce rewards for difficult content need to match with difficulty where sought after items require completion of difficult open world events. Alternatively, make gemstore skins, story based content where utility or bonus things are the focus. E.G Skyscale collection, people got it because it was cool, was it actually "difficult" to get? No, it just took a little bit of $, some time and grind, just like a gear treadmill. People also got requiem skins because they glow, that took a bit of time, a bit of money. How does money generally come to most people in the game? Farming. What does that generally require? Minimal skill, maximal time, again generally similar to many gear treadmills out there. Gemstore skins? Oh wait, gold again, gotta grind that gold, back to grinding similar to a gear treadmill except it isn't about the stats of your gear but how pretty (or obnoxious) you can look.   
---
At this stage, if Anet actually made something open world really difficult what would be the result? I think it's likely people will complain it's too hard and that they can't get what they want without spending a bit of time or effort after only pressing 1 to get everything. They probably won't even think about how something needs to be approached and label it as too difficult. That's what the GW2 playerbase is like and Anet either needs to cater to that, or if not, somehow change a large majority of the playerbase's mindset in order to survive as a business. Mind you, the GW2 demographic is a more casual playerbase and seems to consist of a lot more older folk, not everyone want's it so difficult, just something to pass a little time and enjoy playing with others, these players also don't have absurd amounts of time to grind or "become extremely skilled" at the game.   
---
One last thing to note, many many many many (I cannot stress this enough) players, play for the nostalgia of another game they loved either growing up or in another stage of life that they either do not play anymore or is dead etc. Many people try replicate the feel of that game in GW2. GW2 isn't the same game, but that's how it is.
---
Chrono makes more of its own boons than reaper, with illusions traited right and quickness/alacrity wells, you make your own quickness, alacrity, fury, and 25 might for the first 20 seconds or so of a fight, while reaper only makes a little bit of might and some quickness.
---
Arise, brothers!
---
I mean, I love GW2 but im not gonna lie to myself and say there's tons of stuff to do at max level. Its literally just doing the same events over and over until you have enough materials for something then moving on to the next event. Maybe there are other things that can hold your attention but no matter what it is its rooted in monotony that will not make your character stronger or your account better.
---
I hate to break it to you but Guild Wars 2 isn't Guild Wars 1 and many things that applied and were prevalent in the original game, thankfully, are not present here.
---
not just permafrost, ton of super expensive dyes dropped from 100g+ to around 20g
---
Ok so this is a "lost in translation" or "misinterpreted" thing.
---
End game does refer to fractals and raids, these contribute to the repeatable end game content loop. It's not key farming, it's not world bosses, it's not gathering routes and it's not collections. It specifically refers to the repeatable content found at the end of a player's progression.
---
For GW2 they are the fractal CM's +/- 1-3 T4 fractals, and weekly raid clears.
---
When somebody says there is not enough content, what they're saying is that the content loop is too small. It's around ~1-1.5hrs of fractals a day and about 5-6 hrs in raid clears a week. Anyone who plays for more than 3 hours a day (which isn't that much for hardcore players) will inevitably feel a lack of content.
---

Humans have enough already. They host the Jubilee and Wintersday. and technically Halloween is a human holiday even though it's hosted in Lion's Arch.
---
I love the idea of the Sylvari getting a spring blossom festival, but what kind of activities would there be? In Japan the festivals literally mean 'look at the flowers', and there's street food and lights. That would all fit in the Grove easily, but won't really keep players engaged. 
---
Although I wouldn't mind the different cities just getting decorated for a week at a time. No other big to-do, just some pretty decor and maybe some music, a few lines of npc dialogue wishing you a happy whatever-day-it-is, and then just quietly going away until the next year, like most holidays in the real world. It would help the world feel even more lived-in and organic.

---
[Mesmers used the good ol' "No u" spell on Warriors](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/581/strange.jpg)
---
I'll readily admit to being the druid (Deadeye main) that takes Healing Spring to VG (and pretty much every other boss) because this isn't exactly healing in any other MMO and you can just overheal all the damage. I've solo healed mid strat VG multiple times and never had an issue with my lovely healing spring. Also I'm too lazy to switch. Being a healer main for about 7 years before Guild Wars 2 makes you aware of just how boring and simple healing is in this game. 
---
However, if a group is going down to lack of heals, then the druid should absolutely switch skills.

---
That is still going to take a whole lot of patches...
---
I wonder how many internal timers Scourge has at that point
---
Yes, because it was done in less than 2 minutes.
---
People often use the term "endgame" to describe difficulty. For WoW, raid is endgame, and M+ is viewer content. While high-end raiding is truly hard, the raiding itself is still in my opinion, somewhat overrated. The amount of preparation is the hard part. With no exaggeration, to be ready for the 4 hours of raiding at night, I take either a 30min or 2 hours nap in the afternoon. Then I wake up and do chores for the 2 characters I play, which aren't even that many. I begin relaxing 30 minutes before raid time just to make sure I have good performance. During the day, there are Log reviews, watch my own VOD, think of ways to contribute more in raid, etc. All these plus character maintainence and splits are the hard part. These are something GW2 does not have, which are understandable to those "veteren" WoW players. 
---
People who say GW2 has no endgame are really trying to say, the game I play(ed) is harder than yours, and therefore I am better. To me, this is just very naive. Such people would say: "The spec I play is harder than yours, therefore I am a better player than you". "I play a disc priest and you play a holy paladin, so I am the better player". They love to draw comparison. In reality, if both specs are viable for certain encounter, the "easier" spec is always better because the attention saved can be spent on elsewhere. The "easier" spec is also better for progression when learning the encounter and setting up cds/timers. 
---
Content wise, GW2 is a much better game. WoW is a horrible game if only playing casually, and only raid is both fun and challenging, yet sometimes feel like a chore. Don't bother arguing with those "veteren WoW player" haha.
---
How do you address them? Politely.
---
As far as the actual question, ask them where specifically they got that notion and when was that source from. A lot of that misconception comes from the first month of vanilla when the speed clearers didn't have a raid to grind from day 1 at max level. The game is much more robust in content nowadays, but those types still hang on to that old thought. Challenging their perception might be easier if you can undermine the assumed validity of their stance.
---
As far as gear grind, as others have said, fractals are great for encouraging getting ascended gear as well as stat-increasing infusions that take a bit to accumulate. Legendary gear is another goal.

What about way above the canopy? Lots of open flat terrain there.

At a certain point leading people to their death repeatedly is just disrespectful of others‚Äôs time. Sorry this happened to you.

You can right click on a salvage kit and choose to salvage all blues / greens / rares / at once . You will be doing this constantly. 
---
You can click the little cog up top of your bags and "deposit materials". This sends all crafting materials directly to your materials bank without travelling to a bank. You will be doing this constantly.
---
It's like the nature. Some people who cleared mythic content early always say to those who killed the last mythic boss months later something like "Your kill is not the same as ours" or like "Your kill is irrelevant". While it is somewhat true because the boss gets nerfed to the ground and gear becomes optimized, they say that is because they want to emphasize that they are the better players. It is actually likely to be true, but there is no need to specifically call out for that. However, I completely understand them. It is more like justifying their effort spent on the game for achieving a seemingly equal result (both got Cutting Edge achievement).
---
I quit WoW just after BOD. I still enjoy raiding and would love to go back, but at the same time, I feel like the time and effort can be better spent elsewhere in life. The character maintainence is just too tedious and not fun. The Azerite catch up system (same as artifact knowledge) basically means the 20 hours I spent grinding island are the same as 2-3 hours of work a few weeks later, but I still have to do it because it is somewhat required for raiding. 
---
I would only go back to WoW if they require less grind to keep up characters and make gear distribution better to reduce splits. However, I don't see it happening in the foreseeable future.
---
Hey guys. I'm almost done with Ad Infinitum. I only need the 3 final fractals with the Challenge Motes activated. I posted in LFG in-game and no one joins. Is there somewhere else I can post to see if people would run those three fractals with me?
---
Actually sandbox games are cheaper , because you let the players essentially make their own content.

It doesn't coincide with the current drop in price since this birthday gift has been continuously distributed for the past 10 months. The drop related to gifts happened in August and brought the permafrost form 1-2k to \~500g.
---
The current drop is related to the BLC rotation.

Even if this was one of those commanders, they wouldn't admit it until they lead you to your first death....  While I don't condone what happened to you and your friend, it is just a game and this game is full of frustrating things that happen. You both could easily have left the group after you were both lead to your first death and joined another one at a different time.

It might be me, but I can't get the autologin to work.

Whenever I use "Set Loginfile" on an account A it starts fine.

But every other earlier created account then starts with the credentials of account A no matter what its account informations were set to previous.

*Why do we have to take orders from mice and talking cabbage?*
---
I've been watching this game for sometime and honestly.  
---
I don't know if to play it or not, first of all I'm mostly F2P player due to economic, 'political' and localization reasons. I can't purchase the expansions and I'm all about endgame content and find the whole prospect of not having the expantions jarring as well some of the... limits.

Agree. Most definitely those people who aren't skilled/geared enough to do T4...
---
This is pretty much like sc's in Guild Wars.
---
Take the Fissure of Woe for example.
---
With a normal balanced team comp you can do it in ~45-50min.
---
Now you do split all people in different roles and take rangers with shadow form and whirling for tanking and solo tasks. Add in the Vos derv, that just got over buffed the last balance patch years ago for spiking that can also split some parts.
---
And now you can do very casual runs in sub 10min.
---
The same goes for every other elite areas and all the dungeons.
---
"Correct."
---
It sounds like he's referring to the non annual ones in the first category. As far as I understand, those now won't be reset, and won't be replaced next year. Instead, the annual ones reset each year while progressing the big annual feats achievement, which grants 50ap every year for like.... 20 years..
---
Why is the shattered wings 25 but the non shattered significantly less rare and cool looking one 100....
---
The MMOs they use to hold GW2 up to are gear treadmill games. Imagine every 2 1/2 - 3 months, they release a new tier of gear with marginally better stats, marginally better infusions, and require an overall gear score for you to challenge X content. So you need to grind certain things over and over again for mats/currency to increase your gear score to challenge the "new endgame". Some people may enjoy it, I did for some time. But I just really can't play FF14 for longer than 2 months at a time without getting really burnt out on the gear treadmill. I even made the mistake and started enjoying myself in Division 2, lo and behold; gear treadmill. It's tiring.

Most people I known who complain about GW2 talks about "items in and game are the same stats with other player". I always tell them that that's the reason why GW2 has a lot of end games. Unlike other mmo, you grind gears to be strong, and stronger than other players so you chump them on PVP, which is not the case for GW2.
---
Yeah, that's one of the options, but it's still dumb since it can be easily disproved anyway.
---
Normally, fake leaks seek to bring attention and interest to certain topics that would be ignored otherwise. However, GW2 doesn't have that much talking about new potential content, so you shouldn't have that problem here. Better post it as what it is and have a healthy discussion instead of fraud accusations, imo.
---
That's exactly what heart vendors are
---
Mhmm.
---
Imagine being someone who did that for easy money and saved ridiculous amounts of time and effort in real life being glad that it was nerfed. I doubt the average person is that virtuous.
---
You can buy extra keys to open, and 30 nearly free ones a day. Plenty of players might buy boxes and open with cheap keys, at which point they earn a profit and you have someone to sell boxes too
---
Could check with your guild or wait till they are the daily fractals. Also depends on what time you're posting things are usually more active around reset.
---
I think that what people often mean by that is that GW2's delivery rate for end-game content is quite low and that the content is still extremely casual-friendly (which is good IMO, because that's the target audience of the game).
---
The confusion also comes from the fact that when people say "end game" they don't mean "things to farm once you finished leveling" but rather "High level challenging content with the scene and the competition that comes with it".
---
A raid that can be cleared day 1 in a few hours by a PUG group isn't "endgame" content, even though it is "at the end of the game".
---
&gt;How is making 26 Alts during the 3 years between expansions the "endgame"
---
In WoW, they release raids in intermediary updates between expansions, lately they even released a raid (of only 2 bosses) between two "chapters", it took 2 weeks for the first guild to clear it.
---
If we compare from BFA's first raid release (not counting dungeons):
---
September 4: WoW - Uldir - 8 bosses, lasted 15 days.
---
September 18: GW2 - Mythwright Gambit - 3 bosses, lasted a few hours.
---
January 23: WoW - Battle of Dazar Alor - 8 bosses, lasted 13 days.
---
April 17: WoW - Crucible of Storms - 2 bosses, lasted 16 days.
---
June 11: GW2 - Key of Adashim - 3 bosses, lasted a few hours.
---
near future:
---
WoW - Eternal Palace - 8 bosses
---
WoW - update 8.3 final raid
---
GW2 - ??
---
Yes! For only 10 jorbreakers :(
---
Every time people find a way to get by in a game with fucked economy those idiots nerf it. I miss GW1.
---
Imagine exploiting every single flow in a not perfect world, and them always blaming others for it.
---
Gather farm. It takes some learning and some effort , but it makes gold. I got bored of SW and started just gathering instead ( disclaimer: it is no less boring ). I make probably about the same as I did in SW. For 12 hours in SW I would make around 200-240 gold. For gathering , I make about 170-200 gold per 12 hour game play day BUT I don't gather that whole time. 
---
But as I said , it takes research and market knowledge.
---
Were people really expecting any different with 100 gold per hour?
---
Too bad they just hotfixed a cooldown in...
---
160g mini woop, or 10000 Zhaitaffy.... The prices this festival seem ridiculously inflated, almost as if to future proof it
---
I don't. Why bother wasting my time trying to convince people that are already convinced of something else ? If they don't like this game, so be it, they don't have to.
---
And if they want to bitch and be salty, it's even better, my block list has infinite space.
---
True if you only play the gear treadmill.
---
you just have blinders on as always.  
---
there are people out there which optimise or optimised dungeons in the past to such an extreme, that normal groups won't ever reach that level of skill.  
---
many parts aro soloed while the group is already doing something else, you need to know every single portal spot as mesmer for example...imagine that on 25 different dungeon paths.  
---
if you are that normal person which takes 6 hours for a dungeonfullclear, that sure, its not hard.  
---
cut the time down to 1h and its not the same level anymore.
---
?
---
15-20g/hr is only the bad brainless zerk farms in open world.
---
there are still a handfull who give at least 50-70h/hr.
---
i make like 10h/hr with afk farm alrdy lul
---
Vertical progression means they can cover the same old pointless grind with a fresh coat of paint every few months, so while mechanically you do the same, the content you do feels different. In GW2's case old content remains relevant for years, doing SW or tarir for 4 years is gonna get more old than doing any WoW dungeon/raid for 5 months before moving on to the newest dungeon/raid.
---
I know a little about 1-kit holosmith, condi kalla revenant, and a tiny, tiny bit about open world sword/X phantasm chrono.
---
My holosmith uses this: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Protection_Sword/Shield
---
with marauder gear so I can use it as holorifle in WvW if I want to screw around. It's very sturdy and the damage is ok enough for open world.
---
I don't know much about condi holosmith, but I suggest just sticking to power for now.
---
For that build in open world (don't take this to raids or fractals), you want to activate photon forge, use the 5-skill to knock everything down and generate some heat, then .. I think it's 4 that does a large sweep/damage over time (this damage is irrelevant you only care about the buffs it gives you) and a few autoswings to get your heat up above 50, then use your elixir U for quickness and a big damage boost. Hard Light arena should only be activated over 50 heat and gives you a lot of buffs, which work with your specialization skills to make you very tanky. It's for tough boss fights so you can stand in melee longer and get more damage in.
---
The rest of the skills are situational... you don't need your leap closer if you're already in melee range. Pistols are good single-target damage only. The mortar kit is for when you're in a group or absolutely must have ranged (some bounty targets can only be damaged from range at certain times, for example).
---
It's important to note that autoswings (especially with elixir U over 50 heat) are good damage, you don't want or need to be spamming everything all the time because your third autoattack swing hits hard enough to be a good use of combat time.
---
Also WoW is an overrated relic of the past.
---
Stop praising it so Blizzard will finally start making WoW2 already.
---
The Gear Treadmill is pointless and boring. The Loot system needs a complete overhaul not this titanforging BS.
---
Tab-Targeting Combat puts me to sleep, change to action combat with active blocking, dodging and aiming.
---
I'd love more realistic graphics like in the cinematics but that might just be me. I don't like the comic style.
---
How would I go about farming enough jorbreakers for the back wings? Seems like the taffy from the pinata caps after a point, so how else would I get enough?
---
Trick the endurance bar while in air on the griffon and to keep flapping the griffon wings (jump button) to keep gaining infinite height.
---
That's the one that comes to mind at least.
---
It goes both ways, it's why I play both games. I can only do SW or the same meta events or the same fractals so many times before it gets boring
---
I personally like the permanent ones they added around Tyria the best, especially Gendarren (easy but nice route) and Brisban (hard to get a first place on but lots of cool elements with jump boosts and tight turns)
---
no, i just speedrunned back in the dungeon days and sold raids alongside SC, vC and other known members.  
---
LMAO
---
H3H3 cosplay ?
---
I'm pretty sure some of those items are meant to be long term goals. Probably we'll see them return next year, some might be more expensive though, seeing how they price e.g. Halloween minis from previous years, which are also limited to get during Halloween event.
---
I want to wear these like paper masks, they‚Äôre so cute!
---
&gt; [btw, the dude you flamed did this, its worth to watch and educate yourself on the topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q038AkPwPUU)  
---
pugs take more then 20 mins for this path, even with skips. 
---
oh yes using toys and tonics to move faster requires so much fucking skill   
---
it takes them 20mins cuz they walk normally and 3mins if they use other things to move fast which may considered "exploiting" by anet standers
---
*A H A I , O U T L A N D E R*
---
ok mr elite raider have fun in your dungeons
---
It's not that he bitches or dislikes it. He's just pretty "meh" about it overall. But it bugs me because he hasn't even seen the endgame. My other friend thought the same thing after levelling to 80. I bought him both xpacs and now he plays it a decent amount.
---
most good farms can get over 50g/h, so i dont see your point.
---
Who are you to dictate what's fun and what not for people?
---
If he was trying to argue abut speed clearing, you would have a point. He isn't though.
---
From what I understand, it‚Äôs not that the older code is inherently bad, but that something like half the game is ‚Äúlegacy code‚Äù, made by developers that have since left, and no one can understand as well anymore. This is why balance and structure changes are so infrequent as well. Correct me of any of that was wrong anyone.
---
thats why it says unrestricted, you know.  
---
restricted = toys and mapbreaks are forbidden.  
---
thats why we have two categorys. you didn't know?  
---
its just like records in other games...bet you never watched any ppl doing speedrunning in games. guess what, exploits gotta be exploited to do something faster if its within the rules done by the community.
---
Lfg had a lot of 61 farms even before that post, anet probably knew
---
then where is the fucking skill u talking about   
---
there no skill in using toys and tonics u fucking moron
---
SHAME!
---
Interesting way to upgrade to HoT.
---
Why isn't wintersday in hoelbrek? Seems more fitting with the snow.
---
Question: In contrast to the speedrun antics, what do you think about doing dungeon tours with the steamroller approach. Like just destroying everything you see on the way. I take it doesnt take that longer anymore due to Elite Specs and people having a better gist of what buttons to press. How come people dont like to do that though? Is the extra loot uninteresting or is it just this rush about getting to the boss as fast as possible?
---
True! But that is kind of what I mean, I guess   
---
Developers have to choose between creating a solid and well designed experience or allowing the player base to manipulate the game with their own design choices. Not every player has the tools or training to create quality content (especially if the game has some bells and whistles like voice acting or great modern graphics/effect) so players in sandbox settings tend to trade a well written story/game for the freedom to do what they want in the realm.
---
1) Default amount of health is acceptable (and recommended) for all builds but tank ones (only useful in raid or PvP/WvW content).
---
This is my main cause of burnout. I haven't stopped playing the game but I certainly play it less. As someone who has never done raids I'm hoping that will get me back involved. Otherwise I'll try my hand at cheiv farming. I also need to catch up on the story because I'm like a season behind. Currently just been doing fractals so I can afford my last couple piece of asc gear.
---
Don't play it. It's shit tbh.
---
I got bored of WoW because I was fed up of levelling my heart of azeroth with turtle quests to please factions just so I could use my mounts flight in a bunch of zones I'd already finished the content in.
---
Smh
---
You can already "try out" mounts on either their respective naps, race courses for beetle, dragonfall for skyscale. Griffon if you just begin collection. So if you actually wanted to try it out its there.
---
The amount of times I trudged through any WoW content I could just because I wanted to justify the subscription that flew out of my wallet the day before I wanted to take a break.
---
Shame on you! A Septa doesnt wears gold!
---
The Djinn portals make it easy to get up there after it's set up.
---
Thanks for your answer. So as an open world/dungeon player I don't really need to worry about spec'ing vitality or toughness? And instead instead focus on damage and survival through heals and mechanics?
---
I'm hoping to find a Firebrand play style style I like.
---
YouTube. A lot of SC members do low man and speed clear dungeons.
---
Well, they can still *see* map chat, they just can't talk in it. The other issue is when the advertisements ask to PM, which F2P can't do outside of being mutual friends (yet another justified but equally annoying anti-spambot countermeasure).
---
Surviving in GW2 is often not connected to reducing the damage you take, but avoiding it in the first place. If you do not already, learn to be able to at least walk/run while you attack an enemy. One very simple, yet often effective to circle an enemy while hitting it, regardless of range. This is not effective with all foes, but helps with a lot of them. Once you can do that, practice to dodge attacks you can see coming. Most high-damage attacks are of that type.
---
Even if mobs do not have a CC bar (in which case most often you want to use CC to break it), using CC on mobs can help you survive, as it can give you a valuable break from their attacks. Learn to use them strategically.
---
Apart from that: going down intentionally and rallying is a valid technique, especially if you solo instances. Some down-skills are quite good and/or provide CC you might want to use.
---
I think I came across wrong. I meant that whilst in the same map, you could loan your griffon to your buddy. If you map change or decide to take it back, they're dismounted. They can't buy more griffons or loan them out whilst they're not online.
---
Fractals are a chore once you get to T4, raids are released roughly twice a year at best and when anet does drop one, it's easy af. Events are a joke simply because there is no skill involved. Also Dungeons? Are you serious? Have you even played one? They're buggy as hell and the mobs die so fast, anet could just as well remove them. You say, that other games make old content obsolete but what about old LS maps? Who revisits them for anything other than farming the map-specific currencies or maybe the story? I wouldn't describe running around and pressing F on a few nodes as fun. Festivals are okay but they hardly count as endgame content.
---
PvP isn't even PvE so I don't understand why you would include it but let's say it's endgame content for the sake of argument. I doubt you ever played PvP for more than completing the daily if you claim it's in a passable state. The amount of condis and boons is laughable. There are BOTS even in lower leagues. 
---
I can't say much about WvW but according to some, it's getting repetitive.
---
Endgame doesn't just mean content for max lvl characters but also hardcore content. GW2 is a game for casuals so it doesn't have endgame. Don't misunderstand me, if a game is for casuals, so be it, but the problem is that there are no big MMORPGs with good endgame afaik, though that's more an issue of the industry rather than GW2.
---
This post seems more like an attempt to gain karma and confirmation from the mostly casual people in this subreddit by feigning ignorance and looking down on the people you critisize. Or maybe you are ignorant, who knows.
---
the [condi quickbrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) is not too bad for openworld, dungeons and low level fractals because of the dps and support your offer.
---
If you want more than just working go for power instead of condition damage in open world. The rampup time is too big for the low healthpool of most mobs.
---
Literally the last piece of content that required some sort of trust, coordination and communication between players got gutted.
---
That would be awesome. I can see elementalist get elemental summons on each attunement key like the Tempest has his Overloads, then his utilities would be Commands/Orders to make them do cool stuff :) As to engi i can see why it is possible but so far i can't imagine how he would be, kinda like a turret engo but mobile AI maybe?
---
At certain points, specifically with alot of non-vet/elite mobs thats more than fine to do, even in a speed clear.
---
I think if you were clearing everything it'd just take too much time. You'll steam roll everything and fights will be short and easy, but theres just too many and it'll add up.
---
Well, like some1 expected something else after the reddit post. If you have a good way to farm gold in this game, better not share it on reddit if you want to keep farming.
---
I really hope this is groundwork for future ranger stuff and not just nonsense change as right now we barely  have any interactions with commands other than BM trait. I am all aboard the Bunny thumper hype train :P
---
&gt;gw2browser
---
got the right one know and it works! thank you
---
Wait what, 2 gods??
---
That's likely where it will live after dragon bash, but without a easy WP up there not that easy for most of my guild to see.
---
He‚Äôs saying if you buy all the treats and then skip all the jumping puzzles, etc then it‚Äôs that price. Reality is that stuff that you‚Äôre skipping is so easy it‚Äôs just not worth buying. Takes an hour or so max.
---
Quick question- Are the UI textures in gw2.dat? Mostly colors since I already removed the pesky textures with ICM.
---
This post was made to get some more ideas about, not only, what I can do at max level, but also what my friend can do.
---
If you're worried about the difficulty in the last core story mission, good luck in further content
---
You can buy Brilliant Djinn dubloons (sp?) from the TP at around 40g each, you only need 2 for a set to go the top.
---
If you have a hard time finding a party and/or clearing by yourself ping me. I should be free Saturday night.
---
Basically, of course the skyscale stuff have a variable price, being on the TP rather than the NPC Merchants. But in the Date of everything was done on Day 1 it was possible of doing them, everything comes down to arround that price! The real cost will be depending on the request/supply.
---
wow that's quality armour
---
Well, it's quite derogatory to say that. People do and talk about what they enjoy doing.
---
Someone who seeks raiding experience in MMO's and want to know more about Guild Wars 2 will rightly warned that there isn't what they are looking for in the game. 
---
(even though there is some kind of "endgame" in that sense but they will probably be disappointed because it's not the highlight of the game).
---
Likewise, if someone was to say "Guild wars 2 has no elves and orcs". They are not close minded. They are just saying what there isn't.
---
Mostly people rely on timely dodges, As guardian, you also have a lot of blocks. Since guardian's HP pool is quite small, you need to prevent incoming damage. Speaking of gear, you dont need to run some extremely tanky gear, like knight or soldier. If you wanna improve your survivability, better try marauder if you're power or dire/trailblazer, if you're condi. Overall, look at wvw damage builds. They can dish out decent amounts of damage and most of them have some durability, unlike pve damage builds which are just glass cannons.
---
Yes, I saw that, too, but generously attributed the "s" in classes as a typo ;-)
---
The thing that is what mostly make players struggle is that they never really take the time to learn how all skills, build, stats, runes and sigils can synergy with eachother. And also pay attention to what the mobs is really doing to you. Moving is one thing but sometimes you get lots of conditions on you, what is your way of cleansing that. Conditions do different things to you, some slow you down, some root you, some poison you and so on, what does that really mean. Well if you get rooted and the mob infront of you is about to do his mainattack but you can not move away how do you solve that before it happens? Stunbreaks, cleanse, blink, block interrupt is a few of the things that can help you out in such situation. 
---
Combofields can be life savers since depending on what combofield you have you can cleanse, get speed, blind and other things that either help you out or give you higher damage.
---
Dodges and blocks and such make sure to use those on the right hit from the mob. They usually have one or two skills that will get your in to trouble if not dealing with them whilst the rest is something you can move away from or just eat because it does not effect you.
---
Break bars are also something that you need to be very aware of. If not breaking the bar of the enemy will mostly result in either a slower kill or death because the mob will get access to another skill that hurts you more if not breaking it.
---
https://youtu.be/ZvC4GtQXKHA This video will tell you all about break bars. Having good cc with you is important so that you can break them in solo fights.
---
As for what to pick well guardian over all have good self sustain. In PvE i prefer playing Dragon hunter if i play solo. It have both damage but also a lot of selfsustain, cleanses and cc. Others like Firebrands so i guess it is about what works for you.
---
And last, if you soloplay say a story and you wipe. You have learned something when you wipe. Maybe he drown you in condis or stun you or what ever it is that you feel is not working. Have a look at your build and skills and swap out and in what you need. There is no reason to have a static build and skills. Swap to what you need for that fight. I often swap in and out with condicleanses if there is to much or add stab if the mob push me around and so on. Figure out what you are missing and swap your bar. Sometimes you might even have to swap weapons for that one fight.
---
So learn what your class can do for you. It will take a while but when you know, you then have a lot of tricks to use and it will be easier to survive when you know how too.
---
Having alacrity and quickness affects your rotation a lot also chrono is about using most of f5 to get that dps or wells multiple times ; just because it s easier for you to have dps on necro doesn t mean a thing. It could be that necro has better self boons or a better auto attcks or better vulnerability application idk anything about necro tbh. But if you do your dps testing if you manage to get to the golem just add every boon boons you don t normaly apply like stability or vigor wont be the sudden reason why your dps is inaccurate ; missing 20% cooldown reduction (25% faster recharge) 750 power and condition damage from 25 might and 420 precision from fury aswell as quickness matter a shit ton. Also add every condition to the golem and take the lowest hp golem if your new and the middle hp one of you want realistic dps values that exveed just the start burst of your rotation.
---
It's closeminded to assume that anything that isn't a raid isn't endgame. Regardless of your preference in game modes and mechanics, to dismiss anything that isn't a raid is asinine.
---
There's a difference between acknowledging differences and ignoring similarities.
---
Add the wing version and it gets way over the top. And next year when i ask for SAB mount skins, i will refer to this wings and chair to anyone saying no it will be too much.
---
Also i wonder why Inquest now? Is it a hint on what to expect for season 5?
---
Also add every profesion specific buff there are plenty of them that don t rly affect your dps but those warrior banners and stat aura buffs from ranger revenant and warrior def do and most of they are mostly realistic to have and compensate a little for the food you will not use or the infus :P
---
that doesn't change what he said, he talked about base toughness, which should be 1k for any non-tank.
---
This is naive.   
---
If 5 players exploited a bug, they would just get banned and/or stripped of gold.   
---
If 5000000000 players exploited a bug, the chances of any punitive action is zero.
---
I wish there was some form of slipper or sandal footwear.
---
If you add a group to the lfg-tool not waiting for others to do it then sure you will make it.
---
Apart from aggro, toughness is a wasted stay in raiding. Even most tank fights you would literally want just one toughness more than the other 9 people. Having a whole set of toughness gear means you just threw away a ton of stats. You can definitely still perform the role with toughness gear, it‚Äôs just a peeve when people go to the hardest PvE content without even trying to optimize for the role.
---
You release your talking to a hardcore raider... Right?
---
You really don't know what you're talking about.
---
Your attitude is really pathetic and immature.
---
Grow up a bit mate, it's pretty sad.
---
Hell no! That would piss me off tremendously and was the reason i left my latest MMO because of the grind it takes (and why i laugh at people who call out GW2 for having a grind, little do they know) the amount of time it takes from your just to be able to stay on top and aiming for the worlds first boss kill. Holy shit so much NO to this.
---
Adding to what has been said:
---
- Your F1 can be traited to blind enemies on activation and reset when you kill a foe if you use the Radiance trait line (pretty much all meta builds do). This is great in areas with basic and vet mobs that die quickly.
---
- They aren't meta, but staff and mace have healing skills included, hammer offers protection at the end of the auto-attack chain, sword 3 blocks ranged attacks, shield 4 gives aegis and 5 knocks back foes and absorbs projectiles.
---
- In terms of meta weapons, focus 5 will block 3 attacks in a 4-second period on a 35-second cooldown, greatsword 5 has a pull which will interrupt enemies, and scepter 3 is a brief immob which can keep an enemy away from you (and right in the middle of your AoE).
---
- It has already been said but Litany of Wrath really is an insanely OP healing skill given the bursty rotations of DH and FB.
---
Specific to Dragonhunter:
---
- When activated, your F2 skill Wings of Resolve is an 800 range leap that breaks immob, heals for almost 4k HP at level 80, and is also leap combo finisher.
---
- Your elite trap, Dragon's Maw, is great for pulling/interrupting enemies and grouping them together for your burst rotation, and Procession of Blades greatly increases said burst. You can instantly mow down large groups of enemies, it's great.
---
Specific to Firebrand:
---
- Mantra of Solace heal is a relative small heal in comparison to LoW's potential, but it also gives you aegis and recharges every 12 seconds.  If you're fighting an enemy with slow, telegraphed attacks, you can use this plus your F3, dodges, focus 5, and simply never get hit.
---
- Your elite, Mantra of Liberation, is a stun break that grants stability and retaliation.  Though I generally prefer DH to FB, I really miss having this OP stunbreak when playing DH.
---
- Your F2, Tome of Resolve, can be activated and will grant you multiple skills that will heal, cleanse conditions and cast regeneration.
---
- If you're still having troubles, Mantra of Lore is a utility mantra skill that also cleanses conditions and grants regen.
---
Even running a full DPS fractal/raid build for my Dragonhunter, I did a large chunk of HoT and pretty much all of PoF mapping/HPs while solo. I suppose ultimately it depends on your playstyle, but I have found it to be an enjoyable and highly survivable class.
---
Can't fault your logic so it must be bad.
---
http://gw2dungeons.net/ still exists but it really hasn't been updated in forever. Still has a bunch of skips and routes listed as well as some old records but it might be a good starting point at least.
---
Will have to watch that when I'm home. I've been looking for a video that breaks down everything in the game since my friend isn't very MMO savvy, even in his WoW bubble haha
---
Arah is soloable for story now.
---
People are not mentioning Celestial stats as a variant for herald. I had mostly celestial plus some berserker gear on mine and it was one of the best experiences in the game. The revenant gives you use for all the stats so the celestial varient is best imo.
---
Wow, thanks for this, I'm really in doubt between dragonhunter and firebrand, I loved the idea of killing large amounts of mobs with firebrand, but the strength of the dragonhunter makes me think, I wanted to have enough gold to test both haha
---
I cried the day the Hydras started running out of my AOE fields.
---
Three healers is wayyyyyy overkill lol. Where do you need that much healing? Most relevant mechanics are oneshot and you only need two for the rest
---
&gt; Proper dungeons
---
Proper. As in fast. As in speed clears
---
Oh so it is, thank you!
---
Wonderful idea, and splendid execution!
---
I'd personally change the necklace to a less conspicuous dye. The sparrows wouldn't wear jewellery, I think, but that's just me.
---
I love the laser pointer idea bahaha. Itd make an awesome contrast, seeing those killing machines happily chasing a red dot .
---
With the wand/torch. He's doing decent damage and have access to quickness to attack faster/proc justice faster to get more burn. Worst case scenario, you can even reset the tome with your elite skill.
---
\*hard cm .. there is only one hard cm. All other cms are pretty straightforward.
---
You agree with them and go play other game while you wait for next episode
---
No. Stop trying to make this game into Wow.
---
Ding.. ding..
---
r/mildlyinteresting
---
Yes, when you just imagine new meanings for words, you can fit everything into a bad argument.
---
There is a reason why we don't have gear progression like in WoW.
---
If you still want some gear progression, look at fractals.
---
NO
---
How does it feel to be stupid? Next time read my post before commenting.
---
I ignore them as they already strayed too far away from Dwayna's light to see the glory before them.
---
There is a lot of easy gold to be made from selling Zhaitaffy and boxes. Doing the dailies every day is like a quick 7-10g for less than 20 mins of work. The rewards suck IMO, so I like that I can get gold instead.
---
&gt;How does it feel to be stupid?
---
Wouldn't you be the expert?
---
That's sort of my point. The stories in raids are related to living story, but because they are 10 man content, most of the playerbase isn't going to experience it. That type of content is much better told through a dungeon (physical location in the world, story related to the main story). There's nothing preventing Anet from making dungeons just as hard as any other "hard" content, since dungeons were the original end game, challenging content.
---
Fractals are literally just random points in space with random backstories unrelated to anything in the main story. That is a much better setting for 10 man content which is inherently only going to be played by a fraction of the playerbase.
---
Please tell me what part of mindlessly bashing your skull into the same two metas ( Silverwaste, dragonfall ) Is fun , engaging, or anything more than a tax on your soul.   
---
I'm genuinely eager to see how you justify De-incentivizing farms across the board in the name of ' Fun and engaging ' Gameplay.   
---
Similarly, If I were to show the massive, Incredible map, with tons of areas, and then put red boxes around Silverwastes and Dragonfall, and say " Once you're done with levelling you'll probably spend most of your time here. At least, if you want a decent income "  They'd run as well.   
---
And don't hit me with that " Just do T4 Fracs / Raids " Because the amount of prejudice and toxicity there is a bit stupid. Sure, there's good people, but unlike in other sections of the game, there's a lot more digging to get there.   
---
I didn't mention WvW as an income source because it's not. It's a time tax for Gifts of Battle that pays out so below-the-bar that If you don't do it for amusement you're really wasting your time trying to make a profit off of it.
---
Choose a random one, buy/craft a shield with useful stats, transmog it.
---
ArenaNet's philosophy on gear progression have always been that your char from 5 years ago should be as competetive today as it was back then.
---
no thanks
---
They could. We don't want. They won't.
---
Next !
---
PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT (this is what guild wars has always been about since long ago in gw1)
---
Ofc its overkill but alot of mechanics that you just avoid as a dps that just damage you alot you can ignore with 3 healers. It's just easier that way if your DPS is fine. You can easily clear most encounters with like 120k DPS and if you have 4 decent DPS players you already have that covered. With Druids being able to buff the whole raid now I believe you only need 4 supporters (2 Chronos, 1 Warrior, 1 Druid correct?) so you have up to 6 DPS slots. Sure the fight could be over much faster with 2 more DPS guys but it goes over much smoother and with less wipes if you just take 1-2 healers more with you. (Especially considering that the Warrior does DPS competitive Damage (~25-30k I believe). 
---
Chronos and Druids can probably also do 30k damage combined if you build them that way but my guild usually lets them go all out on support/defense (aka Full Harrier/Giver/Minstrel). So yeah we have 2 full healers at least with 2 Chronos supporting them on the side and sometimes we take a 3rd just because we can.
---
Is it overkill on healing? Definitly but I'd rather clear all bosses in one-go in 2 hours than having the opportunity to clear them all in 1.5 hours if nothing goes wrong. (Haven't raided since W5 came out so this calculation is with only W1-W4 Bosses in mind)
---
Just my Opinion, I wouldn't do this in Pugs of course though.
---
2 clicks that I pretty much do every 15 minutes or half hour or so.
---
Its just a simple quality of life fix that isn't to much to ask in my opinion.
---
It becomes tedious and I am not demanding it, I am just asking if that is possible/desireable by anyone else.
---
Attacking in Diablo 3 is also "just 1 click" but you do it 3 times a second.
---
Not that I complain there but you can't simplify it down like that.
---
yup, you cant change the dyes of the jewelry, but i get your point, gold is not be their thing.
---
The recharges would have to be a tad longer to compensate there's no energy.
---
Couldn't have said it better tbh
---
Catch them and bring them back. Not like they can get away. 
---
"I can outrun a centaur"
---
I edited it after you wrote it but I didn't see it because I didn't refresh the page.
---
True but then at least let me hotkey it so I can do it with a click of a button.
---
Having to open the inventory, click the cog and hit deposit item gets tedious real fast.
---
Didnt think of the immidiate access to the bank in ESO. Good Point!
---
But you could eleviate that by the item popping up on the side with a different icon if it goes to the bank immidiatly.
---
But having it on a hotkey would already be a huge relief.
---
Ok bye :(
---
Definitely. But some people don't see it as endgame because it's not traditional, which makes me a sad boi
---
It doesn't matter how you accumulate the effect, by stacking agony resistance or getting these 'marks'.
---
When it comes to raids, difficulty should stay the same, things should only get easier through one's experience.
---
Unless they ever add some sort of 'story' mode. With the same mechanics as normal mode but more forgiving damage, except for the key sure-kill mechanics that would stay sure kills. And that gives limited rewards just once per character like story instances, not daily/weekly every time like dungeon story paths. And of course and no legendary crafting components or achievements would be doable in story mode, it'd be there just to see the story and have a taste of the mechanics, and train newbies.
---
At this point you‚Äôre literally just arguing over semantics.
---
Ppl who like your idea: you
---
Ppl who dont like it: everyone else
---
Srsly that is an ‚Äûidea‚Äú brought up by many others (you just utilize it in a slightly different way). It always was a bad idea and still is, no matter if you agree or not. Gw never wanted gear progression (in any way) and thats what many like about the game. If you look for a game with these kind of mechanics i recommand you stop playing gw and start with games like WoW.
---
rather not
---
Nice buddy, thank you I‚Äôll try meet you there!
---
&gt; If OP got it from the coffer, he got it from the coffer, u cant change that fact
---
You just missed the fact, that OP do *not* really know where he got the ring from. Like I said before, it was most likely a drop from a champion bag, which he got from the dragon coffer. 
---
&gt; So il just say it quick. U can believe what u like
---
No reason to start getting salty. All I wanted is to clear things up, because you spread wrong information. It's just not nice, if people have a hope for ascended stuff from bags that don't even drop them. 
---
&gt; il stick what to ik and u can take it or leave it - any pve loot bag can drop asc. There is no "limitations or restrictions".
---
Your character have to be lvl 80 to be able to drop ascended stuff from bags... just for example. There *are* limitations and restrictions and this is not hte only one. 
---
&gt; Note that it is impossible to acquire ascended equipment chests from open world content and containers with characters below level 80 (one exception to this is Daily Fractal chests). 
---
You shouldn't spread wrong hopes, only because you *think* that you got an ascended chest from... yeah, you never even mentioned from where. But I guess it was from one of the well known sources and you either don't remember well or didn't knew about that bag/chest.
---
You have some anger issues.  Dungeons, fractals and raids are exactly the same thing.
---
They are, yes.
---
Thing that makes you win is YOU and your SKILL, not gear. Gear makes you strong enough to have possibility to win the fight. You know... expensive and quality guitar doesn't make you a good guitarist. Your skill does.
---
I don't like this idea. I don't want a boss which is easier only because someone has a special thing and it will replace your skills. Something is easy because all players know what to do and they don't make any mistakes. It's a win for everyone and by everyone, not one player.
---
There is *plenty* to do if you're an achievement/collection chaser. Even for the stuff that isn't outright grindy (doing 1000 of *anything* really is too much for a single achievement...), there are entire lists of things do work on. Then there are the skill-based challenges with story achievements and Adventures.  ..which would be better to work on if we got retry triggers in Living World stories, and HoT Adventures weren't time-locked. But still, plenty to do.
---
&gt; How is making 26 Alts during the 3 years between expansions the "endgame"?  
---
It's not endgame, I just like it. :) I find it easier to play with new builds and put together new wardrobe looks ~~the REAL GW2 endgame~~ when I don't have to mush my inventory onto one character.
---
I wonder if next content will be focused on Inquest.
---
&gt; Also i wonder why Inquest now? Is it a hint on what to expect for season 5?
---
I don't think so. Gemshop stuff were never bound to future story releases.
---
I only learned what it is yesterday, I thought it was just a rez achievement or something
---
Mad respect to anyone who has it, I can't even find a group for 100 cm
---
Expansion and Living World story is way better, especially from LS3 on.  I also feel the Personal Story gets worse as you go along.  All the race-specific chapters are pretty good, and the Order chapters are generally solid as well, but after Claw Island and the formation of the Pact, it really becomes a slog.
---
Guardian also has highest base toughness with warrior and revenant tho, so its not as squishy as ele or thief.
---
Does it have 3 eyes though?
---
Anet hasn't budged from their 2006 raid design since they released it with HoT like five years ago or something. It is highly unlikely that they're going to get it up to date, less alone improve on it.
---
Well... guess I'm boned.Haven't done Stampede at all yet, so I won't be able to get all the AP for it before the festival ends. Womp womp.
---
With the credit card you can farm up to unlimited gold /h
---
what are they waiting for nerfing it ?
---
This obviously isn't the right game for you if this is what you want. How about an optional mastery line instead?
---
still waiting on the rhino bus, anet...
---
Have you tried the listed locations right before and after the current one ?
---
You should read the article again more carefully. She changes locations on Fridays. You have to refresh the wiki, it will update to her current location
---
Refreshed it several times bro ;) You should think more carefully.
---
Refresh the wiki. Not your internet browser
---
Sorry. The page was bugged. I fixed it now
---
For some reason the refresh button wasn‚Äôt working
---
nice thx
---
Rationally speaking, it is... acceptable. It certainly is showing its age and is, in some instances, leaning towards boring play. 
---
The writing is also rather boring and bordering on ridiculous in some cases. Like, the order conflict. I get it, I /get it/, the whole uniting the orders thing has to be a big deal. But do they really have to convey it via the order representatives bashing on each other because of their most basic approaches and philosophies? It was really cringy and the only redeeming feature was the fact that, mechanically, it mostly served to give you simple, clear-cut choices.
---
I am still disappointed about this to this day. It gets better later on, though. 
---
Reason aside, as a Sylvari main, I have a path through the PS that I actually really like and am fond of. It includes Trahearne very early on, features the magic mirror's vision of Orr, etc. It's in my opinion the best variant of the PS if you don't look at the entirety of its branches. 
---
And as far as most MMOs are concerned in how they tell their core story, it is still decent. Really. I am still glad the writing improved later on.
---
That's fair. Honestly what matters at the end of the day is getting the boss down, if it works for you guys then it's not my place to judge. Have a good weekend
---
Praise be the Joko
---
Please do not mention my lack of endgame, it makes me uncomfortable
---
I don't really see how farming outfits is somehow worse than farming outfits with better stats
---
If you are playing Heal FB I'd use Minstrels personally, but make sure the player is always tanking. FB makes a great natural tank and being able to face the group for mantras is great value.
---
Not tanking... well that's another story.
---
I guess if you don't have the extra cash, you could. If you want to get into flipping, you will want several different markets to balance out where you make or lose profit. There is always going to be a risk.
---
Personally, I'd stash it and wait for the price to go up, but I also have the flexability to do that.
---
Unless you need the short term loss recuperation (and if you do, you should be flipping cheaper items), never relist your stock. Every time you do that, the BLTC takes it's share in listing tax. You're better off just waiting.
---
SHAME!!!!
---
Don‚Äôt hate me. Some characters I just use an outfit
---
Pretty much.
---
I'm not sure why you're comparing to Dwayna to Largos, Balthazar to pre-norn etc as they all come from a completely different world where it's unlikely those existed.
---
Bigiftru.
---
Until now guild wars 2 was a prequel to another massive guild wars ?
---
Anyways when I saw caithe linkinf to Aurene for the 1st time, I felt like something major just happened. Then the order of the Crystal Bloom born. I really hope anet is taking that way.
---
Why do you think it came all this way?
---
Gear progression nah but I‚Äôd like some of the masteries to be a bit more grindy. It‚Äôs depressing that the PoF and LS masteries take like 10 mins of play time to max out
---
There used to be F2P friendly web sites, but they are outdated and no update.
---
-
---
GW2 creditors are mostly hostile to F2P players here. They don't understand why ANET even sell this F2P? They all sound like ANET stock holders.
---
You really need not explain why you want to do F2P. It is between you and Anet.
---
Contrary to most redditers say here, F2P does not stop you from having fun. Running around let you experience more of the beauty and fun of GW2.
---
You can have unlimited play(each eMail has 2 slots). Need more space? Buy 18 slots bag with game currency. Need more, store them to other play slot.
---
F2P can not sell anything or mail anything, but can buy stuff with limitation with in-game currency.
---
The maps are huge and lots of hidden places waiting to be explored.
---
Last, the accounts stay with you and can be upgraded to paid account anytime if you choose to do so. The real purpose of Anet's F2P. Anet wants you to enjoy the game whether you buy it or not, but wish you buy it in the long run.
---
one day I will pull of 19... 
---
...one day...
---
well she isn't there either
---
Kinda.
---
They should have opened more coffers if they wanted more jorbreakers. And if they want more coffers to drop they should buy more accounts!

Also /s
---
The wiki has a full guide.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Matrix_Cube_Key
---
Fb gets toughness from f3 and quickness as well. Occasionally you take aggro even on full minstrel.
---
You can solo river with it ;)
---
Expectations subverted.
---
The game wasn't harder, we were just bad.
---
the small green flame that marks it is very hard to see so my suggestion would be to goto the locations it says on the wiki and run around them til you see the interact prompt
---
Just found it doing this thank you
---
Are you playing on xbox?
---
Toasty!
---
good until claw island. the death of your mentor is shit. orr story is still 50/50.
---
by far not as bad as ppl make it seem to be.
---
What class, what are the options, what build? We're kind of missing all crucial information here.
---
Revenant
---
so that's where he was all of season 8 while we were expecting ta ya know, do something.
---
Still not as stupid as suggesting an increased to max level.
---
Grieving works better with Renegade/Asassin, but a Berserker hammer would still be better for power if you have to go ranged.  
---
Viper works better with Renegade/Demon or Dwarf/Demon as an alternate ranged set to mace/axe.
---
Celestial is not the best choice for a purely damage weapon.
---

No need to use pauldrons

 I'm at work so I don't know exactly what item it is or the specific price, but I always forget to ask this when I'm actually home so, here it go...
---
I have an Item that can be sold for something like 300 gold on the left panel of the market thingy... I think it's called "Sell instantly". But there are people on the right side selling up to 400 gold. However, there are the fees and stuff that I have to pay just to list it, right ? I'm afraid to list it and never sell it and lose like 40 gold just for the listing. I don't have a lot of gold and I'm saving it to buy 3 chapters of the Living World 3 that I don't have.
---
I appreciate any advice. Thanks.

They need to make that crow just tell stories forever.

Have you tried grieving?
---
What mod is this?
---
It‚Äôs a website, www.gw2bltc.com
---
What dyes dropped so steeply?
---
I'd check some trading post websites like gw2spidy, gw2tp and similar and see how often those items sell and how much their price changes.
---
If it's not often then just sell instantly otherwise it's better to list it.
---
Picked up darkness and grave yesterday for about 48g for both
---
This isn't the first time, pretty sure he's doing it on purpose
---
Internal timers is the shittiest way to balance something.
---
For what, support?  I just poured my all into power and condi.  Will be another month or so til I can craft support gear.  Honestly, that rotation is HOT GARBAGE.  If your ping sucks, you can't even do it properly.  I'm on fiber and it still sometimes sucks hot chocolate salty balls.  Whoever at Anet that originally thought up chrono as a support was high on the supply.
---
every single class has a condition, power and support build, so why should that be listed as extra?
---
Go celestial, you get an increase in all the stats as it's clearly visible on the screenshot.
---
I really liked my condi firebrand. To get around the squishiness you can run full carrion gear with Balthazar runes and sigil of smoldering. Upwards of 20k health and still max burn duration. You also have a bunch of sources of quickness which makes things so much easier.
---
Thank you for the idea. I would probably skip that boss if I need rifle. To me, rifle thief was a huge letdown and does not play how I thought it would. Doing everything but largos/demos sounds good though.
---
What I'm afraid is to set as 400 and someone just set theirs to 399 99 99, you know ? That happens A LOT with me (with items that are waaaaaaay cheaper) but this one, just to list it is something like 40 gold. That's why I don't know what to do.
---
GW2 endgame ‚Äì outside of your first Ascended geared character ‚Äì is nothing more than collection fashion items, achievement hunting and QoL acquisitions.
---
Compare this to the *traditional* MMO gear grinding ‚Äì with steady raid releases ‚Äì and any sane person would claim the obvious: "GW2 has no endgame.".
---
Change my mind.
---
Oh, then the second one all they. It's the best
---
Even if you sell instantly you'll lose around 40 gold. Iirc listing is 5% while selling is another 10%. When you instantly sell, both amounts are included at once.
---
Fun detected, fun nerfed :(
---
Those are metas.
---
This is awesome, nice run!
---
Oh god I missed this page. /facepalm.
---
That is actually what I wanted. Thanks very much! And yeah, you are right, build do matter to show the viability on every role, true.
---
Thank buddy
---
That guy right there...  Best story in all of Tyria.
---
I would love to have a in depth story about them and not just being  the bad inventive guys.
---
Bring back distort share it was broken and I love it
---
Yeah, but I do like to read and see all aspects, even if I do not plan to play that way today, is nice to see everything as a whole and know that certain things exist and are walking to that way. Thanks!
---
I already found what I wanted on a page I missed inside metabattle. :P
---
Would like to refer you to power reaper minionmaster, one of the best solo builds in the entire game. Minions are very good for solo play. 
---
Scourge is fantastic with bloodmagic. 
---
Otherwise, outside of solo play, spite/soul/reaper is the best for power, and curse/soul/scourge is best for condi. Blood/soul/scourge is heal/support, depending on gear.
---
1600g long term is still 1600g.
---
The only weakness I can think of for melee necro, is that the only engage/leap they have is only on reaper, shroud 2. Otherwise you have to follow your enemies around manually. Not too big of a deal but coming from pretty much any other class it can be something to get used to. Necro has insane cleaving capabilities though, so it rarely matters much.
---
Like someone else here said, it‚Äôll just become a complete clown fiesta where the skilled players get their marks really fast, and the less skilled players won‚Äôt have any. Then either the majority of raiders are locked out of the content or veterans with marks literally sell their presence in the raid. It would be like a bad pug group recruiting an insanely good chrono that can make the raid much easier, but instead of the chrono being good, they just have an item that makes it easier, no actual gameplay required.
---
Warhorn is no longer necessary for power, as wh5 was changed to leech recently. Wh would be brought for it's cc, otherwise the offhand is entirely up to the player now.
---
No problem. Have a good one.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I have always thought it was fairly weak. In fact, I haven't even finished it in spite of playing since early access.
---
My first MMO was SWTOR, and I came to GW2 somewhat grudgingly after some real life friends quit that game but moved on to GW2. Obviously I liked this game - here I still am seven years later. I just couldn't finish the story, though: it was so, so, so far beneath the standard that I had gotten used to in SWTOR that it was borderline unplayable to me. Reasons include:
---
* The voice acting felt wooden and cheesy. A lot of the actors involved with this game are good actors, too, so my assumption is that they were following direction. For example, I seem to recall Logan feeling over the top bombastic back in the early story, but not in his appearances in HoT and afterwards.  I don't think the actors did a bad job so much as I think ArenaNet, being perhaps a little new to VA story telling, didn't quite know how to use the voice actors.
---
* The "two characters swaying back and forth in front of a background" felt incredibly out of date to me even back in 2012 compared not only to the more "movie scene" style presentation of SWTOR, but really of all kinds of different (non MMO) games at the time.
---
* The writing felt extremely trite in too many places. For example, the mentor death thing just felt so predictable and pulled out of 1,000 other stories beforehand, and worst of all, it was one of those "pointless sacrifices" that don't even feel like they make sense in the story and exist purely for the sake of pathos. 
---
* In other places the writing felt to me like the kind of stuff you see 12 year olds making up when they play with each other as they try to the best their 12 year old selves can do to imitate the kinds of stories and plot devices they see in afternoon cartoons. I think the writing has gotten much, much, MUCH better since. The HoT story and beyond is almost unrecognizable to me compared to the base story as far as I played it.
---
* Mechanically, the story was really quite rough to get through. There were way too many parts which amounted to, "talk to these people and then spend 15 minutes killing slow mob spawns." The Claw Island scene is one of those where you feel like you're just fighting for an hour, but it's at least a little bit more forgivable because that was sort of the point of that scene. I remember another one where you help the Hylek and you're just fighting these waves of mobs for what seems like forever and it just all got so old so fast.
---
It's not nearly impossible, I've done it around 20 times.  You just have to be fast, and have something that does cleave damage.  And not run after every node, and then get pissed when everything dead, 30 seconds after it spawns.
---
&gt; Would like to refer you to power reaper minionmaster, one of the best solo builds in the entire game.
---
Boring and low damage. Minions on your bar are fine. Death Magic &amp; Blood Magic are garbage.
---
Thank you! :)
---
42 is really good, i think even better then 61 :)
---
if skills were added individually, i think more minions could work. however, with the way anet currently adds a whole group of a skill type at a time (elite specs), i feel like more minions ON NECRO would clutter things, but i'd definitely like to see other classes get them.
---
&gt;  Its literally just doing the same events over and over until you have enough materials for something then moving on to the next event. 
---
How is this different from raiding in WoW?
---
So pretty much they're Giant Norns
---
When I get off work tonight I'll send you an in game mail / message!
---
Also, if you are interested in getting into raids (and are in NA) feel free to hit me up.  Occasionally I run training groups for some of the "easier" bosses.  (easier is in quotes because everyone is different and some people find certain bosses easier or harder)
---
Its not weird its true. Just because most ppl dont have them doesnt mean they are hard.
---
Is this in Hoelbrak?
---
WhO hAs A bETtEr StOrY ThAN bRaN tHe BrOkEN?
---
I'm not the guy who was needing them. Although the good news is that you can buy them from Glenna if you've killed either Qadim at least once. But it's probably easier for people who don't raid to buy them for ~40g than find someone to buy them for 20g and some gaeting crystals.
---
I‚Äôm sure there are still speed clearing farms to be figured out for just advancing levels and skipping the longer fractals.  Would at least reduce the monotony.
---
*pouts in Icebrood Claymore*
---
Maybe go into the PVP lobby and let him try out classes at max level. It's not exactly a good show of max level content, but at least he can see how playing a max level character feels. Although I'm not sure if f2p accounts have to wait until they have at least one character of a certain level to get into the PVP lobby, or if that's just WvW and LA.
---
Thanks but as I said before, I can't buy the xpans due to Economic and Legal reasons (As having or making deals on dollars is ilegal in my country) so it won't be possible.
---
Doing everything would Take a Long Long Time ^^ that aside i would still buy gw1 (with all addons) and Play at least through the campaigns because they are realy good (even more If you have Friends to Play with ) and U learn a bit about the Backstory + gw1 factions is fucking great
---
Probably because that was only *one* Elder Dragon. People weren't suffering from world-ending-doom fatigue, and wouldn't start until... probably, Path of Fire or LWS4.
---
NO NO NO!
---
Staff and mace are completely and utterly worthless on a dps spec, while hammer is 10/10 if you just want to press 1 and afk.
---
If you miss stunbreak as DH just get the stunbreak trap or shout instead of the sword and/or the stunbreak trait that autocasts the trap. This is of course for open world, if you need a stunbreak for fractals you should just kick your firebrand and get a replacement that isnt afk instead (though if they are solo support you can and should replace sword for stand your ground for skorvy and WoR for artsi)
---
&gt;(gaining access to the other profession's skills for that weapon, and getting to choose ‚Äî or mix and match if we're being crazy ‚Äî which set to use for shared weapons).
---
The mix-and-match tech would also open the floodgates for classes that are running out of reasonable weapons to get new specializations for their existing ones and be able to choose which core and which new weapon skills they want
---
Nice flying skills.   Not really a route. But those narrow tunnels are always a pleasure to fly through on my griffon. 
---
Also mega points for using the northern feather wing. Best griffon skin in the game(feathers so op)
---
Oh. I run a griffon flying guild if you are interested in joining. Would love to fly around with ya if you are on NA.  Add me @ Chaos.3579
---
How much time?
---
Can you solo content?
---
Is it ‚ÄúHard‚Äù?
---
_____
---
Long time, Yes sort of, and Yes.. it‚Äôs quite a bit more challenging then gw2 pve but way way easier now with hero/henchmen. (Think of it like gw2 Logan, Carnack and those guys on steroids where you pick their armor and weapons and yes even the builds they use so it‚Äôs a lot more team synergy once you get things rolling)
---
Gw2 pve is designed to be... (*cough Easy) I mean to say ‚Äúable to be beaten by all classes with any builds‚Äù.. (basically just use F and a bunch of 1111 auto attack... very occasionally you dodge and that‚Äôs gw2 pve in a nut shell... maybe use some self heal)
---
Gw1 pve is far more build specific and punishes you for mistakes (so one build may work great in one place but suck balls in the next) and gw1 pve is not designed to be beaten by all classes on auto attack, lol (that‚Äôs part of why we all hated gw2 at first... no brain game and they abandon real PvP so I admit.. I was one of the early gw2 haters). Gw1 pve bad guys have very tight aggro so how you just walk by every single bad guy and pick and choose the fights on gw2... in gw1 you better watch your bubble (or be dead).
---
That‚Äôs also why the old game and the old days are affectionately referred to as the ‚Äúbuild wars‚Äù and why sooo many players who were 300% dedicated to gw1 felt so abandon by the direction of gw2 (At first).
---
Now gw2 is pretty good as a casual game but the pve has little to no replay-ability (where as gw1 pve is basically all replay ability.. and pushing to get better with each pass until you get the award/titles)
---
So yeah if you try it you are looking at something so different it‚Äôs only the lore that connects them... sadly that‚Äôs why so few gw1 Vets came and stayed in gw2 (and guys like me resisted for years and years because... no real PvP still to this day in gw2)
---
Lets wait and see how these changes truely effect WvW, of at all..
---
Firebrand would be much much better in long fights due to its resustainability. 
---
Berserker really wants to kill things before it's Berserk mode ends, because that's where all their potential is. When Berserk ends, you kinda just have to wait around in limbo until it's back up.
---
"i know where your house lives"
---
Where is this? You sure it's not a ranger pet?
---
funny that  i just got banned because of "suspicious activity" when all i did was stand around in lionsgate lol. Took 4 fucking days for them to unban my account
---
Weird that you're talking about making raids harder when you've complained about raids getting harder not too long ago.
---
You know what will happen if you make an encounter so tough it will take over a week for the top raiding groups to beat it? Only a small fraction of the small fraction of people who raid will ever see it. You want a raid given full development time and money so less than 10,000 people could have a hope to beat it in a game of millions. That's not fun or interesting, that's boring and unfair.
---
CM's exist to challenge people who want the challenge. But normal raid modes need to be accessible (and it could be argued that even normal mode isn't easily accessible).
---
Also you clearly don't know what the raiding community is like if you think the marks will be spread out in any meaningful fashion instead of hoarded to give to alts and raid sellers selling them for high prices. Even on the TP if they're that rare and that important, they'll be in the several hundreds of gold range thus out of reach for most players.
---
Plus it's extra clutter and you *will* have people forgetting it on a character and have to spend 5 minutes trying to find what character the mark is on, groups will wipe several times because someone forgot their mark, and people panicking because they can't find their mark and possibly deleted it or sold it to a merchant.
---
So to get ascended gear from spvp you need the currency to buy it.  Can you earn this currency from unranked pvp or does it have to be ranked?
---
Very cute!
---
All the games you have NPC Henchmen that you can recruit if you decide on going it alone They have set skills and AI is quite rudimentary. With "Nightfall", you gain access to more specialized henchmen, "Heroes" that you can swap the skills, upgrade and have a little more control over.
---
Guild Wars 2 also has a very different combat system than the first, with the regular specialized roles of Healer, Tank, and DPS.
---
Your skills are not bound to weapons, that simply have a basic sort of attack. Each profession has hundreds of skills and you have a secondary profession available as well for yourself and your Heroes.
---
With all that said, Guild Wars population is okay and if while you may consider Henchmen and Heroes as party members, its easier to consider them as part of a skill set. Their AI can be finicky sometimes and you can give orders , "Guard this", 'Attack that', or 'Heal Me'. Going through all 3 campaigns will be rewarding, but long and sometimes grindy.
---
Good Luck!
---
Like most people here, I'll recommend condi firebrand. But really, I would recommend power Berserker above that. If you like supports, which it seems like you do, condi firebrand can do great open world support with sending out quickness. There's a few good guides out there if you search "quickness firebrand".
---
Personally, I find power berserker more fun and banners also provide some support for an open world group but you can also go selfish DPS and see big numbers. Warrior is also more survivable due to its larger health pool (like others mentioned, Carrion on Firebrand can help it get tankier without losing much utility). I haven't done much with condi berserker, but I've never seen a build for it that makes much sense to me. Power berserker, AKA decapitate spam, is very fun.
---
1- base life is enough. 
---
If you want more the best way is to use marauder trinkets. Do not go marauder for armor and weapons unless you plan on WvWing with that set). You can also mix some Valkyrie there, depending on how much you like to minmax.
---
2- see 1. Berserker dh with marauder trinkets should not down no matter what unless you afk.
---
3- play meta dragonhunter, but replace sword utility with a stunbreaker. You can use either the trap or the shout; theres a trait that also casts this automatically (middle up) at the expense of 10% damage to your F1 tethered targets.
---
I also -sometimes- replace Dragon's maw with feel my wrath which is, in my oppinion, better for solo open world.
---
French and German. Oh boy.
---
Go into the options menu and check the box next to "AoE Loot on Interact" if you haven't already. Will help with not missing loot from slain enemies and saves time
---
That was... quick, language barrier aside, I never understood why it‚Äôs so hard to work together against the enemy servers... it‚Äôs a mutual goal.
---
Thank you so much!!! I will look at that when I get home
---
Spot on lol. Everytime I see a comment like "o this is so ugly how could anyone like it" I'm like are you that socially inept to have grown up not understanding that different people like different things?

61 with multiple accounts?

 Oh i wasn't offended, i just thought you were a dick. You couldn't cope with his views on raids because you're insecure.  But then again most incels usually are, hence why this game is all you have. üñï

&gt;are you that socially inept to have grown up not understanding that different people like different things?

Do the achievements in Dragonfall. There are 6 specific ones that drop one piece of exotic armor and you can select the Diviner's stats.
---
AFAIK that's the easiest/cheapest way to get Diviner's gear
---
Okay if we're talking about merely completing a raid vs a dungeon then that's a stupid comparison because there are variables to factor into account that make it literally impossible to do a raid in a solo situation regardless of how good you are at everything due to mechanics, kinda like how you can't solo Arah p1 because of the tar boss requiring multiple people to spawn it.
---
That isn't difficulty, it just requires other people to do things correctly which you have no control over. The fact of the matter is that the more people that are involved in an encounter, the more diluted your individual contribution becomes and often times that means you are less responsible for the outcome of success. If I want to do a 15 minute arah solo, I have way less room to fuck up my rotations and need to be playing very microefficiently in order to succeed but if I want to do a raidclear quickly, there is far less that I need to worry about other than just not fucking up any mechanics. If I do my rotation poorly and have 5k less DPS than usual because of a plethora of screwups, it will have a marginal effect on the overall time as long as the boss is cleared.
---
On an individual basis, raiding has little to no difficulty whatsoever *unless* there are mechanics involved. GW2 raids are very light on mechanics though, hence why they're puggable.
---
Never make a buy that is more than 10% of your liquid gold worth. Also don't make buys when a BLC just came out. Wait for prices to stabilize.  
---
1) Keep them for yourself.

2)  Leave them listed and hope for maybe a year
---
3) Cancel and relist when prices begin to go up again.

Stripped of gold? Maaaaybe. Banned? No. They followed the [Rules of Conduct](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/). The most pertinent rule is Rule 17, which reads as follows:
---
&gt; You will not exploit any bug in Guild Wars 2 and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits) either directly or through public posting, to any other user of Guild Wars 2.
---
The farming method wasn't a bug. I don't do fractals often, so I didn't fully understand how it worked, so please correct me if I'm wrong here; fractals were designed such that they are repeatable for rewards. This farming method took advantage of that in a clever way. This repeatable design was deliberate, which is confirmed by the nature of the nerf. It wasn't a bug‚Äîjust an oversight.
---
Similar idea too, since you can solo the first portion of aetherblade and have multiple openers.
---
It's funny you mention logical harmony because visuals are subjective. What appears to be logical harmony to you is in fact completely based on your lived experiences and preferences. At the end of the day it's just a matter of respect (which you clearly lack) for the opinions and perspectives of others.
---
*Inhale*
---
Remember that they are fans of the Book series... Before it became cool in GW1 there were references, especially in Elona, in regards of Dorne and the Sunspears
---
Yeah, it might have been nice to be able to unlock saddle at the same time as, say, finishing up the sick skyscale collection. You're finishing up the Dragonfall stuff and as you go out into the rest of the world, Gorrik let's you know that you might need hoards of garbage for some reason. 
---
I read ahead and knew what was up so I farmed LS4 pretty intensely for a week or so, but yeah, big grinds would be more palatable if they had more advance notice.
---
what seller are you referring to?
---
| Is it better to stack vitality, or toughness, or both?
---
just go full berserker, epsecialy pve, i see no point doing it otherwise.
---
kill mobs faster than they can kill you. with berserker you'll also learn how to position yourself and utilize your dodges. at least that's what i've been doing since start and it's great.
---
yikes
---
waaah stop liking things I don't like!
---
Just dodge
---
Are we allowed to clog up the support with screenshots of verbal abuse and racism? I am thinking about a new ticket every day from now on. I could also leave the game...that's an option as well.
---
Just raid for it honestly
---
It looks like a 3 for 3 swap, SF, BP and Mag replaced in no particular order HOD, SBI and AR.  I'm suprised at the new hosts, but even more suprised at who got replaced.
---
It's a dps increase if you're Mirage/Daredevil
---
You stick to trying and failing to get melee demios down. Hopefully that shiny will drop for you. Isn't that how it goes incel? üòÇüòÇ
---
1) 50/50? Like literally every point? Several thousand hours.
---
2) All the main story stuff you can solo no issue. Some of the Endgame areas will be tricky, though they *can* be done solo. Either to just ask on the /r/guildwars discord. (Warning, don't mention GW2)
---
3) The game isn't even in the same genre as GW2 so it's hard to compare. Mostly it's just playing a lot, though some of the requirements to clear end game areas can be tricky.
---
Yeah I agree with you there, I brought t2/Mai Trin up since that was the other farm I've seen.
---
There is no final reward, why they would want to work for such nonexistant goal?
---
Look I really wanted to call bullshit on your previous comment bc it was clear you were making stuff up but I didn't. This is actual bs tho and is completely unrelated lol. So I'm calling bullshit
---
Every henchman is better than a frenchman.
---
Gw2 indeed has end game content,HOWEVER it is miles different from literally any MMO out there. Endgame in most mmos is basically grinding harder content until you get that rare drop that u need for your build or generally upgrading your gear again after every expansion etc [etc.SO](https://etc.SO) its basically a grindfest for best in slot gear. Since 90% of MMO's work the same way it is pretty logical for a player to say that "GW2 has no endgame".  
---
It's the same as going to another mmo and wondering where is the dodge button.
---
And still did not open the damn servers. That is a joke imo.
---
Sorry I missed you, I am ‚ÄúGeneral Iko.5891‚Äù

You get the ascended shards from the [PvP league rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_League#Rewards) so yes you need to do ranked at some point.

Why would I ever equip something which will cut my own damage without giving a bonus?

If it was something as ridiculous as "reduce damage to x but gives bonus magic find against x" it would be interesting.
---
I‚Äôve heard about selling gift of mastery but where do you meet the people and is it even popular/busy
---
I'm kinda sad I can never enjoy the subs for that video :(.
---
Im not sure what would this change add to raids. Its already kind of like this as more organized groups clear the raid fast while the others take their time and/or wait for strats from the organized groups. 
---
IMO a radical change to improve gw2 raiding is not required. Simply increasing the frequency of the raid wing releases should be enough to keep people engaged. As for wings going forward, they could put more unique and challenging CMs and maybe give a reason for people to do CMs more than once.

I heard Elona was pretty hot though.

Sweet! I've been leveling a few characters trying to see what I like, this will be much more convenient, thanks!

Wrong. Gw2 has no early game. The 1 to 80 grind is just an early tutorial for your class. The endgame is the actual game
---
Bugs can be exploits, and exploits can be bugs. But one isn't necessarily the other. This wasn't a bug and the rule pertains to exploitable bugs only.

By that definition anybody who uses high DPS to skip boss phases or mechanics should be banned. That‚Äôs a ridiculously vague definition that could never possibly happen.

Hi! :D

I mostly use Northern Featherwing or the Istani Blad, cause sometimes Istani Bald feels smoother with the movemend. I always fly on non-animated skins. Animated skins cause lag + I can't see anything because of all the sparkeling stuff.

I own a griffon guild there too, together with some friends of mine.

I wish we could fly together, but I can‚Äòt even join NA as a guest.

F2P players can PM people who are currently on the same map as them. So if the advertiser just posts the ad and waypoints elsewhere, they're out of luck.
---
If you can, then yes please.
---
I'd say:
---
"GW2 has an 'endgame' but the community has collectively decided to give the hardcore community the middle finger. As a result, we get only one raid every 9 months, Fractal ("Dungeon") Hard Modes were abandoned since 2017, the Story Quests have a near-handicap level of difficulty with no difficulty settings to make it harder, and all the large-scale meta events either suffered from player powercreep or nerfed to the ground so hard they cannot be failed. Any attempts to ask for these things are massively downvoted or shouted down by players telling the hardcore community to go play another game."
---
We can't be a community that collectively shuns harder difficulty modes and raids, while simultaneously claiming GW2 has an endgame. We're in a terrible spot for that.
---
"But you can autoattack world bosses to get gold for fashion!" So you're playing GW2 because it's a skinner box rewards simulator, not because of its gameplay or deep combat system. That's not endgame!
---
This subreddit exists is a bubble with unrequited love for GW2. But what does r/Blizzard and r/MMORPG think of what I described above? Pretty sure in the real world, GW2 endgame is a joke.
---
The best defensive option you have is your dodge key.
---
Not to sound rude, but not taking damage is key, while outputting damage so things die fast enough to not overwhelm you. Some defensive options that can help are barrier and protection though

One of the most idiotic ideas ArenaNet has ever had. They have no clue about European culture.

You can test it with a trial account. Make a trial account on EU and invite it to your guild.

I have friends in my NA guild who moved to EU and the guild hall is identical for them - decorations, upgrades and all. Only difference is they will be in their own instance, so you can't see them.

hmm, maybe a few are flipped the wrong way in the post
---
Well that's pretty much the same here in France. Some minds aren't open at all when it's about learning a new language. And they will refuse to go beyond what is taught in schools (which should be sufficient to understand and talk a bit). If they actually take English classes seriously.
---
/wiki guild

says this :

&gt;  As of the September 2014 Feature Pack, guilds are global and shared regardless of the world you are on. All merits, influence, and vaults were merged and shared across worlds.

... also my accounts in NA can access the halls of my personal guilds that I upgraded in EU and see all upgrades and decorations.
---
Your concept makes absolutely no sense. What do you think DPS means? If you are DPS it is your job to do Damage, period. If you can‚Äôt dps, you need to bring group support, otherwise you will just waste a slot and become a huge burden to the rest of your team. Please have some decency, save your holy undying paladin build for open world RP.
---
&gt;Staff and mace are completely and utterly worthless on a dps spec, while hammer is 10/10 if you just want to press 1 and afk.

---
&gt;If you miss stunbreak as DH just get the stunbreak trap or shout instead of the sword and/or the stunbreak trait that autocasts the trap. This is of course for open world, if you need a stunbreak for fractals you should just kick your firebrand and get a replacement that isnt afk instead (though if they are solo support you can and should replace sword for stand your ground for skorvy and WoR for artsi)
---
I said those weapons weren't meta. I know the meta crowd will happily shit all over them. Personally, I am a firm believer of "kill it before it kills me". But if the person I was replying to isn't a hardcore player and wants to mess around with other weapons and see if they're fun and helpful while running around open world, IDGAF what they do and I gave them options.
---
I am aware of the myriad stunbreaks guardian has, thanks. On DH I have to remember to swap. On FB, the mantra with its multiple charges is pretty much always on my toolbar. It's a small convenience thing I miss when I go back to playing DH.

o! didn't know about that! thank you very much! :D
---
just for the record,  I did that out of curiosity :D

No such fractal DPS build exists.

If you want to be tanky and unkillable just play a minstrels support build that will at least provide boons and insane healing to your group. I imagine a minstrels Firebrand is what you are thinking of, it has the added benefit of being one of the currently meta boon support classes (but not with minstrels stats), as well as being basically a must have in WvW zerging.
---
Yes you would provide more for your group by trading off that minstrels to either harriers or diviners, however that would ignore your inexperience with T4.

Hey all, Just came back to check out the game and started the Skyscale achievements.  I'm attempting to gather currency from the season 4 maps, but have encountered an issue.
---
I was able to fully loot Jehai bluffs ore and chests, but when I moved on to Kourna the Caches became unclickable after about 10 or so of them.  I have TacO installed and am being led to caches in the world I can clearly see, but can't interact with.
---
I'm not seeing any info online, but is there some time of daily limit for material gathering in the S4 maps, or is this a known bug?
---
The fact that most players wont accept that this means the default language for wvw is now english is astonishing. sure it was nice having your own language on your team, but honestly after like 2-3 weeks youll get the vocabulary and this discussion is done for.
---
DCUO crossover now?
---
Especially when you can't even *see* them.
---
Btw I'm reading through all those responses to a simple build recommendation and seeing the amount of butthurt and can't help but wonder what would happen if one day both Berserker and Viper stats just disappeared from the game along with meta-builds sites. The whole community would explode and run around like chickens with their heads cut off. xD
---
Back in game, and added you to my friend's list. Hope to see you in game.
---
This is exactly what I've been wanting! Thanks so much :D

You should make a new one and try something new while you‚Äôre at it. That way you can expand from what you‚Äôre used to just for fun.

I've been playing since Dec 2013 and I'm not happy with the way the games been going. I'll be the first one to admit I hardly pay attention to the story . I know people enjoy the story but at this point i feel the time and energy put into it has been at the expense of other core game elements.  Competitive PvP has been a joke for some time and its only been recently that WvW has seen some new content. 
---
 Maps in HOT are like ghost towns because there aren't enough events that are worth time and profit. I've enjoyed the more simple layout of the PoF maps and I think their perfect for new events in the future to be added.  There have been a few new farming events in the new maps but Anet keeps nerfing them. The lack of decent simple mindless farming trains in this game is annoying.  Anytime one starts up Anet finds a way to nerf it or nerf already existing events.  They don't seem to understand these farms promote a sense of community  especially with most maps being dead. 
---
I used to do Fractals and enjoyed them but got burnt out. Fractals /Raids  need to be more accessible to new players and not so elitist.  Do we even have Dungeon's ? lol.  I'm sure I'm missing something but that's just how I feel.  I love GW2 and It's still one of my favorite games I just wish they would show some love to the rest of the game besides the story.
---
Yeah it was a blast and made traversing terrain really fun. Yea I think I tried it out on the DS titan tree too. I remember using it to get to the top of Arm of Abaddon JP in like 50 seconds. I uploaded a video of it sometime after it was fixed. Fun stuff indeed.
---
Well the ring, Coalescense can only be made with PoF.
---
In the time it takes you to find and participate in a VB map for the coat, though, you could have gotten a full set of the Mistforged *and* unlocked super easy recipes to make more of any weight you want. I had an entire set within a day of the release of Dragonfall, and I've since made two more for other alts without even putting a dent in my mistborn motes, and I don't even play the map that often -- I just run it a couple of times per week.
---
If you already have a ton of VB currency, by all means use them on some armor and try to find a meta map for the coat... but personally I'd rather use Dragonfall for Diviner's so I can use my VB currency for other hard-to-get stats instead.
---
Yes, but where are the other mordrem mobs is what I'm asking
---
It's certainly A Way, but it's nowhere close to the easiest way.
---
I hate that anet has players conditioned to think that utilizing legit game mechanics is abuse.  I do think anet needs to adjust in game mechanics with unintended results to get them in line with what they anticipated.  However, it‚Äôs not abuse or exploitation.
---
Not quite. The achievement progress was not supposed to stop with the cap. The lootcap itself is still a thing as far as I know. But you can finish your "do it 15 times" achievement in one go now.
