Pocket Raptors were perfectly designed to be the "welcome to the jungle, asshole" enemy. They were found all over the start of Verdant Brink so they were one of the first things you found, all they do is flank and surround you and then there is this *pause*. This strange beat panel in the fight where they all face you and just freeze, and a second later they all lunge at you in unison, doing enough damage to shred glass canon zerker characters in one pass.
---

---
This is not too hard to deal with once you learn it, but they only needed to kill you with that frightening pause once for you to understand "okay, this is some serious shit." They are 100% the intro to HoT maps, and it is for that reason people tend to joke about fearing them.

Agreed also use it for octovine!

It's an account-wide unlock, so you should be able to do anything to any character you want after unlocking and you'll be fine.

In case they forget their own name :p
---
&gt; Perhaps that is correct, I really don't know. But it doesn't invalidate the point I am making : if people don't like to do PvP and if people don't like that game mode then they won't do it. And trying to coerce them into it is pointless.
---
I agree with this which is why the fault is with Anet to develop it properly so that those who are interested in pvp come to play and stay. I don't play spvp any more, only WvW, because I find it stale and there's nothing to get me to play it. I find WvW stale but I still play because of my guild and only them.
---
&gt; It is pretty clear that the vast majority of people involved in GW2 are interested primarily in PvE content, mostly open world. And there is nothing wrong with that.
---
Thats probably correct but thats because Anet have driven most pvp players away.
---
Wait Tumblr is still a thing?
---
Ah okay. Especially bad with a power build, even less healing. Already made the mistake to take blood magic spec for sustain. Would be better off with spite and kill things faster,

It looks pretty good and unique, maybe needs a bit more contrast imo
---
And the angle is slightly weird but also kinda cool
---
I'm more impressed with the lack of hairstyle change the whole time tbh, I can't seem to go a week without tweaking at least one of my characters.
---
Are there trains for the hero points for pof specialisations? I know they exist for hot so I am wondering.
---
Oh, agree. ANet needs to stop doing this bit at a time balance crap and roll it out at once. 
---
Frankly, I think Mirage Ambush needs to be decoupled from Dodge. I think the F4 shatter should be replaced with the Ambush Trigger, so at least it takes 2 buttons for that combo. 
---
Not that I play it. As crippled as they made Chronomancer now, I still prefer it to Mirage. Don't like not actually MOVING on a dodge.
---
Depends on whether you have the bugged version that only goes away with re-log...or the standard version that only lasts 1 hour....if it's the bugged version it'll be fixed, eventually...if it's the feature version, no, you can't, live with it for an hour(real time and must stay logged into game, being on character select screen won't work...this part I made up, I don't know if character screen works or not, but I do know that it's only supposed to last for an hour).

Oof don’t mention the ebonhawk gate it triggers me! I’ve seen that gate and according to the historical guide to tyria it doesn’t seem like it would connect in to the sacnoth valley gw1 map too much, but maybe it will! Either way I think that gate will definitely lead somewhere later in the season and we’ll get more of the blood leagion homelands. Maybe it will be both! A new map south after an extension map to the south east that incorporates sacnoth? I’m not getting my hopes up too much but after what they’ve presented in the prologue and how they’ve talked about map expansion I really do think this won’t be the last of grothmar. It’s crazy enough that they’ve even put a gate on the map. Think about all the other LS episodes, they don’t usually do that. Even domain of kourna and jahai bluffs don’t have that despite them being connected. There is a zone portal but it looks like an after thought more than anything, not a true gate.
---
You can use points on either specialization, there's no restrictions. Pof don't have as many because the areas are much more solo friendly.
---
When the game was launched, many complained that there are too many trenchcoats for medium armor and anything outside of that is gemmed off.  
---
I think you did alright with the limited toolset but once you fashion war with light or heavy classes, its a world of difference.
---
So I figured out the issue, Riva Tuner was the cause for the game to crash
---
Litany of wrath is far superior to healing turret. 25% of damage dealt converted to health is close to invincible on a dps build. You dont do 90% of dps by doing that. more like 60. Engi suffers a lot from not using high impact skills. Dh has aoe blinds aswell. 
---
Holo suffers also from a lazy af dev who probably only plays spvp. Scrapper was half done and holo wasnt fully designed aswell. Sword is still the only weapon benefitting from heat and exceeds lack a second threshold. Exceed toolbelts are lazy insta damage skills mostly. Imagine if only sword on weaver would have dual attacks. Just give me scrapper hammer on holo, sword just sucks.

To be fair, it's often less about needing the same material in yet another recipe (which is still kind of a problem imo) and more about the stacks of trash mats that everyone has hundreds of, are completely worthless on the tp, and have no decent sinks.
---
This. This here is what ive been mentioning in game.
---
Every profession had a different body build with unique gear and design.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I know why they took the choice to make everyone the same...but in contrast it is a major missed detail of the game that allowed us to connect more directly with our character and role in game.
---
Eh, there are classes that dealt with them far better than others.   Some Mesmer builds worked with them, other didn't.  Ditto Eles and Thief.   
---
Anyone with a reliable persistent AOE was fine.
---
The underwater dragon is a swarm of piranhas. Same mechanic.
---
Does not change the reality that exists now. PvP is not a popular game mode and does not capture the interest of the majority of players. Coersion won't help. I don't see that changing.
---
Which brings us back to the core issue. You (And others) are unhappy with PvP in GW2. What do you do about that? You persevere with things as they are or you look for PvP content elsewhere and play GW2 for what it is.
---
They could sell 'skill skins' in the gemstore, making changes like Green fire for elementalist fire skills, asura-themed engineer turrets, or plant minions for necromancers. 
---
The whip could be a dagger skin, kind of like the whip sword, but without going rigid between attacks.
---
Nice, thanks

I really like Qadim1 kiting on rifle DE. You sit down and play your minigame while you don't give a damn about the rest of the group and in the end you're top dps.

Hi all, I'm a vet ESO player, but the game is going thru some rather annoying changes atm so im taking a long break from it and I have decided to buy GW2 since they bundles the 2 expansions so its a great deal.
---
I've done the basic tutorial as a f2p player once before a year or so ago, and im planning to start a new character to play, but I'm not really sure what class might suit me.
---
In ESO I played healer as my main role and magicka dps as my secondary role will all the classes. I know GW2 doesn't really have a trinity system, but some places I see that there are support/healer builds online so I was wondering if there are classes that can play more as supports/healers in this game and what those might be.
---
My main interest is PvE group play.
---
I have tried to look around but I'd prefer to get advise from active people rather than old posts I can find from googling
---
Really nice bold shapes. Got an online portfolio?
---
I still play power, condi, boon chrono and condi mirage in raids. Boon chrono isnt as fun anymore but its still a cornerstone of double chrono or hybrid comps.

&gt; You cant bring people to pvp when the game is bringing in people who play open world only.
---
That's simply not true. Plenty of people play both. I frequently see people in open world with PvP wings. I know people who started playing the last year who I only see in PvP.
---
There are definitely more people playing open world content compared to PvP (as is the case in every MMO ever, since the beginning of time OMG please stop arguing this isn't absolutely normal for an MMO) but there are still people coming into PvP all the time.
---
One thing that would have helped is if the sub didn't turn into a shitshow right when the game was most visible to people considering trying out the game. Wiping shit all over the walls and screaming at ArenaNet after the announcement stream was the absolutely worst thing they could do to bring in more raiders, WvWers and PvPers, yet that's what happened here.
---
You just described WvW then said but not WvW...
---
A skill like, create a clone every 3 seconds for the next 15 secs would be nice. It didnt add spike power but give fuel for shater build.
---
But in 3D!
---
Yeah but without the recover health part with a short window and an high coefficient. Otherwise the skills will be broken because you can easilly time your skill to accumulate heal for when you need it.
---
Anet said anyone who bought HoT within 60 days prior to August 30 will be eligible for a refund if they bought it from the official store or with gems. They also confirmed that these players would also receive HoT Veteran’s Packs and would be allowed to keep them. 
---
Full details are listed on their [support page](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035070613-FAQ-Heart-of-Thorns-Refund-Eligibility).

They remind me of the Raptors from GW1. You're never happy to see them but admire their savagery nevertheless.
---
The Aquatic Ruins I did yesterday was the Light Carry path for me, so I'm going to assume if you did it today, it would be Dolphin path. Doing it tomorrow will be Light Carry again as it switches them every day.
---
At least that's how it is supposed to be.
---
I really struggled with them on Mesmer until I unlocked Chrono. Didn't help that I was running full rampager's gear either, so my burst was shit. They still kill me more often than anything else in the jungle though. They just get aggroed by a random clone, and swarm me while I'm fighting something else.
---
* Do the 3 dailies, daily (if you can), but it doesn't have to be 3 from the same group. I usually do some mix of 1-2 easy WvW (big spender, monument, land claimer or caravan) and 1-2 PVE dailes to get the 3. Once you get the hang, it doesn't take a bunch of time, but the 2G is 700+ gold annually not counting anything else. 
---
My first year (year 1) I had a hard time finding money for anything because I wasn't consistently doing anything, so when Anet changed the dailies to give gold it helped a bunch. I had a second acct and was more focused on what I wanted to do then, so while I was focusing on getting the second acct more inline with the main, the passive gold across both helped for gearing, mats, etc.
---
I treat my accounts basically as equals, so pretty much all content I try I end up doing multiple times. I waited until Season 2 was on sale to purchase, but already had all my accts logging in for Season 3+. When 2 went on sale I got it with gems, but that's cause it was easy for me. YMMV and there's nothing wrong with converting the gold &gt; gems.
---
With the later accounts, I tried to make the first 9 profession fairly early on. In large part it was just because I knew in order to AP hunt on all of them, I'd have to have every class/race, but also because it kept the birthdays fairly close. I also picked up an extra 2 slots on each, 1 to park at the end of a JP after leveling them to around 25 (this was for the silver doubloons, which I knew I'd need 250 for The Juggernaut or fast gold), and 1 slot for my weekly key run. the Key runner isn't really necessary, but the lvl 10 story mission can be done in about 15 min weekly, and the BL statuette over time I've basically traded in for the home instance nodes. If you don't care about skins, over time you'll also get BL tickets that you can redeem for the skin and sell it on the TP. It's not a quick process, but over time it's more cash as well.
---
Ironically the more top 10-20 players stop playing the game  the more average players would enjoy the game.

The game doesn’t have enough population in high tier to play with them and they abuse the system by smurfing farming rating on low tier players... also killing the game

So does anyone know the song name/if it is uploaded anywhere of the drum beat music that plays during the Ooze pit (I think it is there - it is during one of the meta)? It's the same music that plays when players decapitate the Triple Trouble wurm and I have never found it online, so not sure if the music just by itself exists.
---
"a little"
---
does the khan-ur jumping puzzle give any special loot or is the chest at the end just generic? i've already gotten the achievement and i wanna know if its worth bothering
---
Not what I expected, pleasantly surprised.
---
I keep that gate, the Brisban wildlands gate, and the ebonhawk gate in mind when speculating, so I truly understand. My hope is that since this is new content it’s more planned than the random ideas they had at 2012. Hate to imagine leaving Icebrood Saga and they never even touch on why that gate is there
---
Pretty good concept, though many won't like it. ^^
---
You mentioned using Steam overlay. Personally I used to have similar problems in every single game because of it. Gw2 is really dual monitor friendly IMO since I don't have my mouse bound to the window, you might try that if you can.
---
99% sure Steam overlay itself is your problem, you could try changing your hotkeys in Steam for opening the overlay so the same key isnt used in gw2. I only play via the normal launcher, but hey I learned shift in the map does something.

This is the second tf2 reference i've seen on a non tf2 subreddit in the last 10 minutes
---
all the data on the wiki, anet focusing on casual pve (clearly means less people play any other mode, otherwise they would focus on it because it would make more money) the fact that i can use my brain to realise that most people are just not gonna bother with legendaries, which means they won't actively try and gain shards and will maybe passively gain a couple. none of the sources on the wiki give you a lot of shards. if you're playing wvw or pvp and using a reward track, you're still in the minority, especially after people have been leaving. i'm not mad at all, you are just using things that you don't understand. no one is holding my feet to "the fire". you really have no idea what you're talking about yet you continue to claim you do. i'm looking at the data and getting my conclusion straight from there without trying to twist and turn it so it suits my incorrect conclusion, which is what you're doing.
---
&gt;It's not a problem for me, so it's not a problem for you
---
If you like running pure ranger, try out soulbeast. It’s basically pure ranger but with an extra ability added on. You aren’t pinned into doing a certain style like Druid does. Soulbeast can use the same gear setup as regular ranger to great effect.
---
There's a reason that spaghetti code is a meme here, lol
---
Tnx for the great input!
---
The last tip i can agree on, but with how much gw2 gives you freedom, it can get confusing to a new player (even to those who are used to play other mmorpgs) and having a "content" guide to check from time to time is a nice thing to have as a reminder on what you can /should do at specific times (early game, mid game, at lvl 80, late game etc)
---
Regarding builds, yeah its a whole topic. Rather than specific builds ill explain as simple as possible on how to make your own build.
---
Build types, how to pick a weapon, how to pick specs, what stats should go with what kind of builds and where to get said stats.
---
Ill also touch on the lw and whats the best course to get then ( its to buy then with money during bundle discounts.).
---
Since getting all the gems via farming sw for gold takes about 90in game hours, you can work for about 14-25 hours on a real life job to get the money to gems instead.
---
My assumption is that this dude can’t do t4s and it’s only happening in t1 for him
---
My opinion is the only one that matters because I said so
---
I dig your color picks
---
On a side note: wtf everyone got the Ebon pauldrons except me?!
---
The only "special" loot is that you get some Chilis (plus the daily chest when it's a daily) afaik.
---
I wasted magic on the node from the vendor before I knew it could drop, AND it was 10g more than the nodes usually are. Are the buyers of the node being punished for any particular reason?
---
Fastest way to get these chilli's?
---
Wanna level as a necro? Grab dagger/warhorn, progress with well of blood on healing skill, well of suffering or corruption (handy against dredge) , well of power and spectral run. Start progressing blood magic specializations Line for faster running, blood siphon and wells cooldown. Then hit spite or curses (curses give you fury when you enter shroud) and soul reaping.
---
  
---
Basically nuke everything. Cast well of corruption, warhorn #5, enter shroud, hit shroud #4 and #5 (#5 will proceed even if you leave shroud) and finish with dagger anything that is still alive
---
&gt; I know GW2 doesn't really have a trinity system
---
To clarify on that point, for GW2 it's more that you don't have a rigid trinity: every class can fill almost any role if you build it for that purpose. Sure in some specific situations build A will be more interesting/better to do healer than build B but usually build B is still good enough or at least better than A in other situations. And also the 2 following facts
---
* Tanking only really exists in a controllable way in Raid encounters (not all but most)
---
* Healing is only really a thing in Raids and high-tier Fractals (Anet take on dungeons, given that we also have things called dungeons but they are not supported anymore and you're better of going in them with only DPS builds anyway)
---
Some builds end being just better than most in Healing and Tanking in some situations because they give some very nice buffs and usually allow for the most amount of role compression.
---
It needs investment by ANet full-stop. The community has tried everything to increase player pop in PvP, but at the end of the day... bad balance pushes people away. Lackluster rewards push people. Toxicity pushes people away. Bots and cheaters push people away. Any effort to increase the population will fail because of all these factors.
---
Haha, thank you so much! &lt;3
---
It's just one step for a Norn but 5 for an Asura.

Best way to play ranger: Delete character, make a mesmer instead.

Wanna know what a real pain was?
---
Getting this dude, when they introduced the roller Beetle.

You had to kill this one normal beetle and 15 minutes after it's death, the one you had to kill spawned.

However, the timer resettled, when you killed the normal beetle again

I created a spreadsheet with stuff I want and what to do for it. For example, there's always a legendary on it, when finished, I pick another one. A bunch of unfinished achievements/collections. Daily tasks, e.g., gather flax or iron, ascended crafting, dailies, timegated stuff. Some filler tasks like, do this or that meta for gemstones and other stuff, farming events for trade contracts, and so on. When I'm bored with what I'm currently doing, I open said text file and pick something else. Besides that it helps when you see what else you can do, it's somehow motivating when you can delete something from that list.
---
Second this beautiful silhouettes and subtle texture your style is exquisite link that folio fam
---
While I agree with the fact tempest is tankier ... the dmg output feels pretty meh in openworld imo
---
I had few months of struggle even killing a veteran hydra in POF or simply doing the story and its achievements.
---
But I've tried a Condi sword/focus build (weaver spec ofc) and it feels way more easier and smooth in openworld and soloplay. THe evades + the barrier (eart/fire) help a lot while still providing a huge amount of damage and burst (even tho it's condi)
---
Conclusion: I would suggest you to go weaver as fast as you can and start building a condi set (Fire-earth-weaver) it will fell way easier I promise.
---
For the stats I use grieving since i'm on balthazar runes + smoldering sigil. So I really don't need the expertise of viper since i'm stack in burning duration. But it's less easy to get this stat. Viper works too.

anyone try a rift stabiliser on it yet?

I disagree, this should remain rare and unique. The game doesn't have enough stuff like this.

I have wings because I played pvp 3 years ago. Ancient skins say nothing about current population. 
---
Maybe if Anet announced something related to those modes people wouldn't do that. Instead they told us the same thing from a year ago. When even devs are making fun of pvp, you already know that it's going to be a shitshow.
---
When your modes are full with bots, exploits, skill lags and Anet just makes a random feature that gives even more lags and ways to exploit instead of fixing those, of course you'll get a lot of angry people. Why would players invite others players to play the game if Anet cant get more than 2 devs to work on those modes and fix existing issues?
---
If Anet wanted to get new people to play those modes, they'd advertise gw2 as such, like they did at launch. Instead, the game turned into mobile game style walking simulator because people fap on getting rewards for doing nothing and they spend lots of money on lootboxes and cosmetics.
---
Da fuck,this is too good,i need more ಠ_ಠ
---
I remember when mesmers weren't in the game.
---
The real problem is that the rotation doesn't actually happen at reset as one might expect ... because if there is one thing ANet is great at doing is being consistently inconsistent.
---
i got that container after 15 min from reward tracks after consuming 80 potions right after patch
---
The rotation doesn't occur at reset. Since I am writing this 5 hours after your post it might have rotated by now since I am not sure about the exact time. The easiest time to check would be actually an hour or two before reset.
---
I guess what he meant is that your character looks very cold. All white and blue. Having something to stick out, could give a very eye appealing contrast. Let's say your character is Frosty McFrostface, corrupted by Jormag, but there's still a little bit left of his past in his mind. And that's why he keeps wearing the bright golden star of the sun spears on his chest. (or the purple garment and last memory of his former wife, which died to... blahblah, Or the toxic green dragon mask, symbol of your swamp clan, ECT.)
---
The thing is: perfectly styled and dyed through characters look boring. No eye catcher, nothing to think about, there's no depth to your character design.
---

You missed your point then because this post is about the Charr Hemlet, not the weapons. Which apparently you didnt even noticed.
---
According to the Guild Wars 2 Wiki, that's not correct.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarf](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarf) 
---
&gt;The fight between the dwarves and the Destroyers consumed the dwarven army sent to fight the Great Destroyer. Few returned to the surface to tell the tale of their victory—and those who did had been transformed into stone with altered mentality. During this time, the remaining Stone Summit rejoined what remained of Deldrimor, and the two communities lived together in peace once more.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;However, about fifty years after the Rite of the Great Dwarf was first performed, the last of the flesh and blood dwarves felt the call to undergo the Rite themselves. Now, no longer interested in maintaining their solidarity as a race, the last dwarves scattered across Tyria, finding battles to fight in the deep caverns or making new homes in far-flung hills, ever-watching the borders where caverns emerge into the surface world. The stone dwarves of the Brotherhood of the Dragon left Thunderhead Keep to their successors—the [Zephyrites](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrites) and the [Exalted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted)—to take care of the forges there in preparation for Glint's prophesized [legacy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Legacy) to be fulfilled for the salvation of Tyria.  
---
&gt;The few individuals who can rightfully claim to have met a dwarf in their lifetime are rare, and all speak of the strange, driven passion that consumes these few survivors. It remains unclear how many dwarves survive in the present day.

This. The aggro range on some stuff is just stupid. Especially the wurms. Sometimes you just want to find a quiet spot to check your map and plan your next move. NO SIR. YOU SHALL NOT. WHACK.
---
There's one story mission in a LWS4 map where when you exit the instance when you're done it puts you in a spot well within aggro range of a few mobs. Which is surprisingly annoying :)
---
&gt;There are no competitive titles which have unlimited bars AFAIK. 
---
GW1 doesn't have an unlimited skill bar either, so I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve with this statement.
---
&gt;The limited ability set allows better balancing (well should) and allows more strategic gameplay.
---
You've got it backwards. The limited ability set restricts mechanical depth and potential for play-counterplay, which is essential for titles which are not superficially comprehensible.
---
There's a large quantum between the zergs of WvW and 5 man spvp. A mode with 8 man teams would be fantastic.
---
Want to increase PvP participation? Remove the toxicity. People who either stop participating because things aren't going their way or decide to whisper insults to other players. This is why Blizzard has done this within their games, and to great success. Give people absolutely no chance to prove they are pricks. In WvW, finally stop people from allowing them to use the block feature to start trash talking to you. Hell, the toxicity even affects veteran players.
---
Also do a better join of allowing new players access to matches that doesn't have them going up against organized teams. Game modes that increase team size and make a team less dependent on any one individual player are also more new player friendly.
---
Overwatch has more than 1 game type in competitive along with several maps, and adding new maps all the time, not like GW2 at all. Overwatch actually should be a model for GW2 pvp.
---
Not interested in playing melee, I wanna shoot or nuke things.
---
Everyone with a skyskale just hovers in the air forever...
---
Until someone swoops by on a griffon lol.
---
Trenchcoats everywhere... This is the stuff that made me hate medium armor in gw2. You have so little choice in armor that don't have a trenchcoat..
---
you are welcome
---
Nice spacebar you have there
---
No, because it's a hurricane since it started on water, not on land. Sharkicane doesn't sound as good though.
---
A sharknado can still happen, provided you have a shark basin somewhere in Oklahoma.
---
what are  you talking about? there's clearly one in the pic
---
Yeah, but its like a paradox, they dont invest because its kinda dead, but if they dont do it it will never be healthy. They kinda missed the opportunity to build on to the hype and when it was really healthy, if they really wanna change something they have to invest into it to make it alive again. They can also monetize PvP way better, there were a lot of suggestions by PvP players how they could design gemstore stuff for PvP players.
---

---
Like the skyscale mount, probably something like that.   
---
Because in that vicinity there is a free skyscale mount to get.   
---
So imo 100% a collection or quest related.
---
nothing happens
---
I doubt it. This saga is supposed to be small, back when they were still calling it season 5, and announced it would be right after season 4, I think they said it would only be 4-5 episodes long. Which would put an expansion at about a year away from now.
---
Skimmer is great for breaking under maps, shame it can’t be used for every map tho :/
---
Did they have professional tournaments in GW1? They were aiming for GW2 as an esport title from before launch.
---
What about power chrono?
---
honestly i probably already deleted one of those without even noticing...
---
Nostalgia.
---
Rangers, Pre hot warriors and mesmers were terrible.
---
Necro was a niche pick for veteran teams.
---
Revenants werent even addd.
---
Thats 50% of the classes and builds sitting down in the bench.
---
Was it dropped from meta events in gothmar valley?
---
Gz btw!
---
GW2's interaction with esports is limited to a brief stint with ESL at a time when every Triple-A studio was attempting to use esports as a form of marketing, a fad that broadly fell flat, much like GW2's own attempted entry.
---
Which isn't surprising. GW2 is a casual game at it's core, with the mechanical depth of a puddle. Watchability is on par with the Mariana trench.
---
GW1 easily has far more of a emphasis on PvP, and did so at a time before it was the in-thing to do so.
---
It was perfection ! Needing defense was missing from the game.
---
They were specifically saying it'd be fewer releases but with "more." I'll believe it when I see it. But they basically want a chance to prove to the community that they can deliver an expansion in living world.
---
People still have a kiter at Cairn? Oh man...
---
I don't know how to bring them, but as I am rather new (first pvp season) I wół d like to see:
---
1. Use /team chat to be kind and productive - I played about 180 games, and always say hi. Only once!!! I got responded by all teammates. Its better to write "thief pls go far" than "thief is useless" 
---
2. Remember that its very likely you will play with the same players a few more matches (low player base), especially when playing late or early like I do. 
---
3. Not every match can be won, but it is not fair with your teammates to get discouraged and gone afk. 
---
4. I know that 1 pip for top stats is great, but 6 more for win without top stats is even better. 
---
5. Dont flame. 
---
6. If you see some noobie write what his role is as polite as you could. 
---
The list could be extended, but its what is dependent on you.
---
Whats the reasoning behind using core guard against Alphard? 
---
Just for shelter?
---
I like this route more. It allows me to actively spend time in Siren's Landing, getting pearls and doing events when it suits my schedule, and then park myself around there, go afk for (house)work, and pop in every 35 minutes.
---
It's more flexible this way for people who happen to spend time at / near their computers but without the time to spend actually actively playing. I agree it needed a fix, though.
---
I still don't get how people complained about that. It took literally 3 days to get 250 of each of the map currencies.
---
I do like that Auris Weirdbringer hangs out in the new map. I wonder if we finally get to see his backstory and advance the subplot.
---
Believe it or not, they do.
---
I had the same issue when I first got a new gfx card (1080ti) and solved it by underclocking it. I arbitrarily chose -100 MHz and that worked so I stuck with it. It works as long as I do a powercycle after updating gfx drivers.
---
But the problem has been back since around six months ago ...and just as I'm typing this I realize that it could coincide to when I started using mstsc to remote to my computer during the day - and now I wonder if the RDP session messes with the underclocking setting like a gfx driver update does? I shall try a powercycle between RDP and GW2 sessions to see if that solves my issue.
---
Damn typo, sylvari*
---
If you have a full pug group you'll never fail the timer for all 3 chests. You'll have to be running with all 10 wearing green soldier gear or something to fail, so don't worry about not getting the chest every day
---
I love using the basic Glorious PvP chest (and legs) on my thief. There's only one or two of the medium coat armors I can bare to look at, but I love the almost military/special ops look of it with the Magitek boots and either no shoulders showing or something small and simple, and the Falconer's Mask. Looks great on a deadeye with a rifle.
---
A small price to pay for the Fashion Gods
---
Aww thanks &lt;3 Im so bad at colouring though, but I try my best!
---
Hurricanes and tornadoes are inherently different storms. There is a word for water tornado though, it's waterspout.
---
yep, only 1/10 of what I had to pay for my scythe staff a few years ago
---
Every time the Scavenger's Chasm JP comes up, I always tell everyone:  
---
"We need to drop every pocket raptor and hydra into this chasm and glass the entire thing. There, 3 horrible things gone, nothing of value lost."
---
Should be something that works for every build.
---
Like pulsing 8 times and on each pulse you transfer conditions and steal boons from up to 5 enemies per pulse.
---
Deal 20% more damage and 20% of damage dealt heals you while inside the well.
---
Scarabs, sand lions, gryffons (why do these things get to just evade as long as they want to?)...
---
[Conditions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Condition) in GW2 are specific debuffs just like boons are specific buffs. Condition damage makes damaging conditions stronger. These include bleeding, burning, confusion, poisoned, and torment. So yes, these are the main DoT effects in the game. Every spec in the game has a viable condi DPS build right now though some are much better than others, especially on specific fights (mirage, firebrand, renegade for instance). Also it should be noted that fractals prefer power DPS over condi to burst through fights faster (bosses have low HP and don't let conditions ramp up).
---
Healer/support is not great in open world, you'll want a friend at least so it doesn't take you ages to kill anything. You're better off having a dps gear set or another character for open world. It can be done but again, it will take you a lot longer and be a lot harder than if you were on a DPS build.
---
[Healing Druid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/heal/) is meta on basically every raid boss but is no longer really taken in fractals (heal renegade or firebrand are preferred there).
---
Any use for bloodstone dust and friends nowadays? Or should I just feed them
---
For me season 5 was also the reason why I stopped casually playing pvp. The rewards back then were so good that I pushes myself to play way more pvp then I found enjoyable, and in turn burned me out from the gamemode.
---
 
---
Good rewards are good, but no gamemode should outshine the rest by a huge margin.
---
Hey, there are pug groups with 5 of 10 ppl failing on clicking the shrine teleport...
---
Thank you for your answer. With regards to the 'meta'. Do you have a hard time finding fractals as a druid? Does the community throw shady eyes at anything that's not meta currently?
---
lol true
---
Thank you for the info and the website, I'll definitely check it out!
---
Do you recommend to have another character for open world play rather than changing gear, spec, ... everytime?
---
Creating the new specs is one thing, but the balancing that comes afterwards is another. When you 36 specs to balance there's always going to be a ton of unforseen op skills or interactions with other specs that need smoothing over. No one knows if Anet currently has the capacity to deal with a balancing job that huge. With that in mind, I do prefer revamps and rebalancing of the current spec line-up on the short-term.
---
Or a necro with a hammer to cosplay desmina
---
interesting, thank you for the quick answer!
---
I miss my old Bunny  Thumper build.
---
Thanks! I think I now have a general idea of what direction to go once I reach max level. :)
---
Bricks still used in crafting vision crystals, a couple needed in the 425+ cooking collection, some things like Mawdrey take 2k dust, guild upgrades, bifrost collection (900), bunch of other crafted items, etc. So if you don't need it, ya just use a converter, it's pretty easy to get anyways.
---
I don't, the game just stutters or goes black
---
Food for through: [driftwood](https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2018/08/driftwood-cayo-jutias-cuba-02.jpg) is the tree equivalent of bleached bones.
---
Almost looks like the GW2 dragon logo but with plants
---
sadly alacrity doesn't do much for autoattacks
---
Fortunately most of the people are smart enough to not judge the games from reddit perspective. On reddit all games are dead, toxic, waste of time, and so on. 
---
I haven't seen a reddit mmo subforum with mostly positive opinions about the game.
---
I got stuck today with a big window saying You are over burdened, and it would not go away. No X or Close to click
---
all you have to do as reaper to the pocket raptors is scream "you are all weaklings" "suffer" and your soul is mine" then glide away laughing like a super villain :P
---
It's better than all the black and red I see...
---
Always wanted them as a Ranger pet. A swarm of them. 
---
Missed opportunity.
---
instagram in a nutshell lmao
---
I played pvp a lot in the past, but have slowly but steadily drifted away from it. It really needs some time investment and supervision from Anet.  It is far too easy for your time to simply be wasted by others who aren't playing in good-faith effort.  Queue time is probably unavoidable, but it is incredibly aggravating to wait out a queue and then find out that you're on a team with a bot.  Or someone who quits playing and afks after the first teamfight (not to mention usually flaming the rest of the game in teamchat).  Even if it is only 10 minutes from queue to the end of the match, it sure as hell isn't fun to have your recreation time wasted.  
---
Reports need to be actually investigated and a scaling dishonor system actually implemented and enforced.
---
Pocket raptors die to an aoe though? What's so scary?
---
There's a lot of grinding to do before you unlock it. You'll need to buy all of the episodes of Living World season 4, and get 250 map currencies from each, and there's a bunch of intermediate quest steps before/after that that are not _as_ grindy.
---
I find getting ascended gear through pvp way faster and cheapier than through pve grinding. If you lile pvp, i recommend it.
---
Cant talk too much about the wvw thing, hasnt played it yet since i got back at the game.
---
Welcome back haha
---
That... is certainly weird. I might suggest you ask the support as I dont see how in any way your case would be comparable to mine
---
Not really since I only did pylon as Scourge. If you upload a clip I can propably tell you what's wrong. I see many players taking unnecessary damage from the floor because they stand on the white tiles where the electricity runs through, some even go downstate before Qadim is free.
---
Is that a phone picture of a screen that has a phone picture of a screen on the screen?
---
Why doing such insane lengths is the bigger mystery here.
---
Mystic Forge needs an overhaul anyway imo. Be it just a known recipe page. Functionality doesn't need to change (random output), just save some clicks and prevent bugs like this.
---
When you have a potato laptop that doesn't load character/enemy models quick enough so it seems like you get jumped by nothing and half your HP is suddenly gone and you have no fucking clue if they're surrounding you or not.
---
Also when your fighting veteran vinetooth and doge into a pack of poker raptors. 
---
When you're trying to get a vista and fall and land in the middle of a pocket raptor pack. 
---
Tbh any time you're unprepared for them it's scary. Like, in the time it takes for my aoe to load I'll be down 3/4 of my HP because four of the little feckers decided to attack. Alone they don't do much but together they're awful. 
---
Ahh, sorry for rant "^^
---
yes, it is potentially interesting. however it's not worth a [second post](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d7two5/near_aurenes_grace_theres_a_random_snow_cloud/) by the same person in a rather short time frame just with an updated visual aid. i'm quite amused by the downvotes i seem to have earned with this, despite including the only non tinfoil hat theory about some completely speculative  and evidence-lacking future significance 👌
---
TL;dr
---
Sounds like they should lock professions when queuing and not allow players to switch to address your first point. 
---
And second, PvP in GW2 is dead and will never be revived. The sooner this fact is accepted the sooner Anet can stop dedicating resources to maintaining it.
---
Aaa I think i might go for that ; actually .
---
What about the gliders , are they hard to get ?
---
I remember when certain users were up in arms when holding down alt didn't show their own nameplates. Narcissistic much?
---
After the First HoT Mission you can start to unlock the glider, but it does not take long.
---
Awesome , so am gonna go for a raptor and a glider ; for now . 
---
Thank you so much for your great help !
---
Since I use AoE weapons I never knew the fear of them. That is until I decided to go level up my single-target character…
---
There are several recipes that done once can (sometimes) break repeated use (ie. several legendary components will do this) and/or break other recipes from working.  It's a bug in the client that has been this way since the beginning.  Some times closing the window, putting the items in in a different work or going to the character screen can reset it.  Exiting the client completely and returning has always fixed it for me.
---
Revamps will always remove playstyles that some players are enjoying, though.
---
If we take a look at scrapper, one of the least played in the game, there would be an outcry if it was totally burnt to the ground and recreated.
---
Until 20, to be precise.
---
Your latest looks like he's always stuck with the bobble head tonic. I quite enjoy the previous one actually.
---
Unfortunately, I'm not sure you're going to get many replies on this.  Legendary sigils are not designed well, extremely expensive for what they do, and niché, so few people have them or use them.  I wish I could help.
---
Might + fury works too, so I really love to bring power herald to the group.
---
Season 3 and 4 are more important than two, reward wise. Season 3 gives you a downed skill which is really nice in PvE, and lots of ways to gear your alts with easily farmed unbound magic. 
---
Season 4 gives you access to the beetle and skyscale mount, also ways to gear your character. 
---
When I say gear your character I mean ascended jewelry and back pieces that are relatively easy to farm.
---
Both Season 3 and 4 come with 6 zones as well, so new content.  
---
Season 2, the only reward reason I'd really buy it is the core Tyria mastery points you can get easily. 
---
Mind you if you're interested in story they're all worth it.
---
I think I suck at colouring. Looking back at my outfits everything is either black/white or brown (while brown still looks good on leather armor) but I wish I would be able to utilize more than 2 or 3 different colours.
---
In games like LoL skins do alter particle effects and colour of skills, but only to the point where it still looks recognisable.
---
Nice early things to do for gold.
---
Would you also recommend gathering specific currency from various zones for rewards, ascended items, skins, and gold asap as well ?
---
Or should i split up "daily things to collect" between time youre still leveling up, at lvl 80, core/hot/pof...season 3/4 zones? 
---
I know a lot of people, specially newbies will try to go trough the game in some chronological order, as ive seen a lot of posts here from newbies that get "lost" when they skip from core ,zhaitan story ,jump to pof for mounts, then go back, and then dip their toes in hot and gets eaten alive by pocket raptors
---
The playerbase is still big, or at least as big as any non-World of Warcraft MMORPG gets.  Some veteran/hardcore players are currently being whiny on the internet because there isn't yet another expansion announced, but that's just how things are.  Guild Wars 2 expansions get announced when they're imminent, and one isn't imminent right now, but in a year or two it'll be prepared and all that veteran community hate will flush away.  As a new player, you have seven years of content to catch up on, so the concerns of those veteran players who have done it all really don't apply to you in the slightest.
---
Guild Wars 1 is still running after fifteen years with a small but active playerbase fifteen years after its launch.  There should be no concerns about the game dying.
---
I see male sylvari, I upvote.
---
I didn’t know there were that many people out there with Legendary Sigils. They are so expensive for what they are. 
---
I wish there was an “Omega Sigil” instead where I could just get sigils and slot them all into that Sigil for selecting whichever Sigil I slotted into it.
---
PvP is a fundamentally flawed system. It’s built too much around having lightning fast reflexes and looking for the opportunity to hit your tiny opponent between their 16 invulns and blocks. Simply put, PvP just will never be enjoyable for people below high skill tiers, which creates an endless cycle of player attrition because queue times take longer and longer and less people even attempt to get better. 
---
PvP can’t get popular unless the entire system is gutted in the first place and redone with less emphasis on active defenses.
---
Sometimes when I get bored, I use it along with rifle 4 and prime light beam to see how far I can knock random objective open world mobs away from players without killing them.
---
I am a horrible person.
---
That would need a giant pocket to fit in O.o Or the player character is just hovering in the air above a regular sized pocket raptor, kept afloat by the raptor's emanating viciousness.
---
If you buy a tear of alba itll get you through T1 without any ascended gear. Up to 22 you will be fine without any AR as the damage is low enough to simply tank it.
---
When exactly in the beginning do you die? As long as you're shooting on DE, you generally should outheal damage. Are you taking a big chunk from not dodging the initial knockback?
---
The evil thing is, that sometimes there's only 1 little raptor standing there. You approach with a flyswatter, and suddenly a whole group of them pops up.
---
Stop blaming the "community", the players are not the issue, the game mode is.  Practically everyone but the devs have agreed since launch that conquest is a horrible game mode that provides zero variety of play and does not take full advantage of Gw2s combat system. And the devs have refused to admit their mistakes and replace it out of self-important pride.
---
Would like to log these branches tho , they look like kertch sapling 😋
---
I did join them every day, we started with 5-7 people each time and got the chest with enough time to spare. You just need a few competent people and the rest is carried. They're so horribly undertuned that I don't even know why they exist in their current state.
---
This is a wonderful idea. City of Heroes did similar things with their skills, I think? Or maybe it was Champions Online?
---
Season 2 also offers Mawdrey (both backpack and gobbler) and Carapace/Luminescent Armour as rewards, beyond the mastery points.  That's more armour skins than Season 3 has (but less than Season 4), and completing the collection for Luminescent Armour gives you an Ascended armour piece of your choice.
---
While overall that's not as reward-heavy as Seasons 3 and 4, it still shouldn't be discounted.
---
This game is geared really well towards returning and new players. You should be able to get by with exotic gear off the trading post in the meantime, while you build back up to ascended. The best way is to do daily  crafting for materials and do fractals at the same time. 
---
The expansions are really excellent and you will have lots of content to go through, but core specs are still usable almost everywhere. If you want of rush for elite specs, find an HP train during peak hours or use WvW currency to get them right away. (I think they’re called Notary of Heroics?)
---
WvW is still a thing, yes. I would suggest you find a guild/server that suits you.
---
Hey guys. Got a question about the 5 gold you get from doing dungeons.
---
Can someone explain that to me? Is it a daily thing and can it be repeated? How does it work exactly?
---
Or a quaggan.
---
Yes :) Check the achievement, when you complete a path it'll be marked as completed.   
---
When you finish 8 different paths, the achievement completes and can be repeated again. But i'll advised doing 8 different paths if it's the same day, or just wait for reset.  
---
If you do the same 8 paths again the same day you lose on ALOT of loot.
---
I did daily ranked pvp for a bit, and then it started to feel like a massive chore.
---
I should get back into it
---
I use them for discord, though the discord icon size is a bit too small to do them justice.
---
yeah the other key think with parking toons at the end of JP's is mentally knowing you might have a low level toon there for years for the mats. When I first did it, I was just parking some 80's that I wasn't actively working, but the rewards weren't what I wanted. When I parked a lvl 25 for silver doubloons and a lvl 50 for linen salvage then I felt better on the mat return. 
---
It's not a strategy for everyone, but if they're looking for passive mats it helps over time also.
---
Only black lion salvage kit. The other kits will destroy the infusion.
---
Hey, you're kind of a cunt, huh
---
A few Points to what you said in the video (probably out of order)
---
You definitely want to have Waterspirit in a Raidscenario, no matter if there's 1 Druid or 2, simply because Waterspirit is the only Healskill you have that affects 10 Targets. In Fractals/Dungeons you're better of with either Healing Spring or the Glyph, depending on wether or not you need the Condicleanse.
---
Something you need to keep in mind is that the Heal from your Healing Spring and your CA also only heals your Spirits if your Group is topped of, since Players will always have priority over Spirits (not sure about your Pet/Necro Pets/Mesmer Clones etc.)
---
I'm not sure how you get to 100% Boon Duration with Full Harrier Gear, assuming you use Monk Runes and no Sigil of Concentration, the Gear will only get you to 95% (actually only 79%, but you get 240 Concentration from Nature Magic, so that's whatever), which is another thing, you should've probably mentioned Runes/Sigils and Bufffood, since at least in Fractals better groups will expect you to have Food running.
---
As for Pets, personally I'm using Iboga and Electro Wyvern, Iboga is the Main Pet and I only switch to Wyvern for CC.
---
The only Instance I can think of where your Pet can die would be VG if you skip Greens, and that only happens when you don't pay attention, so I don't see the need to bring Jacaranda when you could rather take smth more CC heavy (as you said Rock Gazelle would be another alternative for that, the reason I don't use it is it's Charge).
---
And as a last Point a small nit pick, but the Gameplay you showed to showcase how Search and Rescue works, in the last Phase of 99 CM; if the downed Player just targets one of the many Krait that spawn and slowly go to the group, where they then get cleaved down, he will rezz and you can rather take another Utility Skill :P
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯
---
Let people enjoy things, if it gets upvoted, obviously there's a market for it. Take a breath, let it go and move on.
---
One can die over and over, even when one respawns to a waypoint or is revived.  
---
This death makes no sense at all since it can happen again after respawning in any way.
---
Standard enemy models covers that for PvP and WvW, so it's only a matter of extending it to skill effects.
---
Watch a play through on YouTube, it's mostly dialogue anyways.
---
Then use the cash you saved to buy a game with more content.
---
It's not meant to be a permanent change, but a way to get information on player performance under a slower pace.
---
It's not something that can be done with the current system, but if they create themed mini-seasons, then it could be done.
---
That's professional level stuff we got here.
---
I know some of you like to imagine me like [this](https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/ew_resize_1920x1080.jpg), but I'm not as fit.
---
I'm going to start using that philosophy in my day to day life.
---
thanks for that :)
---
Oh I wish I could change the title, that makes a lot more sense! I think the leaf just made me think of choya hair so that's what I saw.
---
When that happens, start with the item that bugged out, reopen the mystic forge portal, or reload the map. If none of that works, restart the game.
---
Absolutely. That was my initial impression of the map, along with numerous other areas in the game. For the most part, textures and colors (albeit over-saturated) can look pretty good in several maps but a lot of places simply look too flat and devoid of any dimension due to the absence of properly composed lighting, shadows, etc. even on ultra settings. This map is a prime example of that unfortunately lol
---
Haha next level FashionWars XD
---
Heck I loved this storyline, Arenanet is hit and miss sometimes but fuck they make interesting characters
---
I had a route for completing up to level 80 before the boosters. It was kind of roundabout. Start in hometown. Complete starter area 100% go through part of story. Reach level cap/difficulty. Next area in progression (e.g norn starter area to 2nd area.) Story to cap (usually bring you to LA by then.) Lornars Pass to 100%. by now you'll be in a good area to proceed to mt maelstrom. From here you should be around level 35-45 at least. And start to gain some real exp from events. 
---
Youll be even higher if youve been responsible and gathered/killed critters/participated in events etc. As you progressed. Then once level cap reached finish primary story and max yourself out finishing the orrian areas. I typically reached level 80 after exploring around 40-50% of the map with most ofbthe story completed. This is completely self sufficient and does not even need max exotic gear to do.
---
 A great way to start from nothing at all.
---
TL:Dr explore, story, event,explore,story, event till 80
---
Wow. I will try that :) this is insane how many options there is to make gold in gw2 but not all of them are really worth while. I mostly Daily run Rich Iron ores and platinum So i get like 4-6g with some additional nodes here and there. Its different than Wow where you actually get tons of Gold even from leveling
---
I had a list of ideas for the mystic forge in an old thread in the old version of the forums.
---
Let me did that up...
---
Some may have been done already, but the rest should still be relevant. 
---
* The mystic forge would ignore items in invisible bags. It currently doesn’t.
---
* The mystic forge would get a list of recipes learned as they are discovered. Now that we have account recipes, they would be saved account wide like recipes learned from consumables, making the mystic forge a 10th crafting discipline that doesn’t require a discipline slot, but has a list like the rest.
---
* Adding and removing items to the discovery slots should require just single clicks, not double. Same for discovery in all the other crafting panels.
---
* For simple recipes with fixed ingredients and no ‘variable’ parts, like legendary weapons, exotic weapon skins, siege upgrade and material promotions, mystic forging would work like a crafting discipline, unlocking a recipe that can be used to craft in bulk if you have the materials. You select the amount, press the craft or craft all buttons, and the station crafts it.
---
* For recipes with ingredients that are too varied to have a recipe per variation, (e.g: 4 weapons, 4 runes, amalgamated stones...) the unlocked recipes would be the most generic variation (e.g: Weapon gamble, armor gamble, rune gamble, sigil gamble, crest gamble, crest/gemstone/doubloon gamble, etc), and they would instead have a “Fill” button on the recipe list. The ‘crafting results’ panel would have a different “Repeat” button.
---
 * Pressing the “Fill” button would attempt to fill the recipe with items in your inventory, starting with the first matching item in the inventory. For example, if you had several fine, master and rare weapons in your inventory and the first one was a masterwork one, pressing the fill button for the ‘weapons gamble’ recipe would pick first that masterwork weapon and then look for other 4 masterwork weapons, if there are no 4 master weapons, it will pick the next weapon of a different rarity and try again, then the recipe would fail to pick anything if there’s no matches. So by having just the weapons you want to forge (e.g: Just rare greatswords), the Fill button would easily fill the recipe.
---
 * Pressing the Repeat on the crafting results panel would work a bit differently. It would search your inventory (but not bank and material storage) to try and refill the slots with valid items for a recipe that would have the highest chance of having the same result as the previous one.  For example:
---
      * If you threw 4 exotic greatswords in the mystic forge, the Repeat button will first try to put 4 exotic greatswords, then 4 rare greatswords, then any 4 exotic weapons, then any 4 rare weapons, then give a red warning message tellingyou that it failed to ‘Repeat’ recipe.
---
       * If you threw 4 rare runes, then hit Repeat, the slots would get filled with another 4 rare runes, then masterwork runes.
---
       * If you threw 3 crests and a pile of crystalline dust to get amalgamated gemstone, Repeat will try to do the same with more crests, then with just gemstones or just doubloons based on what it finds first in the inventory, then try to mix them up starting with those that appear first in the inventory.
---
* 'Discovery' would still be possible for all recipes already learned, to keep finding out secret recipes from becoming too easy.
---
Seems more of an offcentric thing to me.

Keep in mind that not all bags give level based gear only few of them do.

Most bags give level 80 stuff.

Thanks for the reply! I can't seem to get it to work though, what am I missing?

If you want to make the most don't bother with ether of those. I assume you don't own volatile magic glyphs, so farming nodes will net you with way less what ppl with these glyphs will receive. A guided dragon fall meta or a ~~sandswept~~ kourna farm will net you with way more money. The "problem" is that both of these farms are more difficult to achieve and not that well known. Silverwastes and AB are easy runs, so everyone can lead them. For the other options - with higher net gains - you need efficient commanders. Oh, and of cause, you will only receive those max gold numbers if you sell everything you get during the farm. That also includes farmed currencies.
---
Edit: Meant kourna not sandswept, sry.
---
Oh ok. At least i will get Iron ore and platinum. But i See that its not like other mmo where you can get filthy rich fast and Just buy all legendaries.
---
Holy hell, goosebumps first thing in the morning

This shouldn't exist...

They look super shiny norn bros.

Now I wanna see Snargle's reaction to Aurene's ascension. : P
---
Aww they love you. Its not about hp at all :)
---
Dude, thanks for doing these! Nice designs for phone backgrounds
---
Because why take the time to even mention it if you "don't care". I get that you are venting but don't try and pretend it's anything but that. I am also a 2012 player, my main toon's birthday is before the game's launch. I never stop enjoying the wonder people have for the game or seeing someone new talk about something they find cool. There's enough negativity and shitting on people on this subreddit already, you aren't contributing to the conversation by complaining.
---
Yes, but Central Tyria is still locked (believe it or not) until you unlock masteries via the first HOT or POF missions.
---
And it continually has an annoying pop-up in the lower left hand corner until you do so. I think that's pretty bad design if you were a new player trying to play the story in order. And Central Tyria shouldn't be tied to HOT or POF. Just my opinion.
---
Coming up next!
---
You get enugh gold for most things just by playing, and good advice is to spend it smartly like always order things from tp and list if you are selling. If you are buying gems with gold stock up on them when exchange rate is good and spend them when sales are up.
---
...or they can keep it as it is, except make it 2-way (10 person limit in PvE and 1 person limit in PvP), instead of the really shitty 1-way nonsense.
---
The cooldown is already absurdly high to actually make it be worth using anyway and there's no way to reduce the cooldown, because there's no trait(s) that affect these skills.
---
The 3s activation time on all of the preparations is also unnecessary, and just makes it feel bad while using them...if you decide to use them in the first place.
---
I have a White Canary (Legends of Tomorrow)cosplay named Captain Sara Lance, I'll update this comment with pics/info when I get a chance.
---
&gt; if I do go ahead and play the first mission of either so I can get rid of this message (and not have all this wasted XP), I can than quit the mission and restart it again when I actually get to that part of the story in my play-through right?
---
Yes. You can skip around pretty much as much as you want , and you can also re-play any episode or story chapter after the personal story.
---
Yeah it's pretty ridiculous. It was an obvious flaw the day HoT released and I think the only reasons it's been tolerated is because it didn't really effect the active player base when it was implemented (they'd all be ready to start HoT and avoid the whole issue). It "just" effects the slow constant stream of people playing for the first time, going on years now.
---
But yes, you can just play one of the missions out of order as a quick fix.
---
It's just a better game in general
---
There should be no big chunk of damage immediately after the initial shock wave. However, you might be taking damage from the electrically charged lines prior to Qadim being engaged. Try to avoid this by positioning to the side of the lines. If you mark as soon as possible, you can also get off 3 TRBs and then dodge the knockback into stealth and an Assassin Signet modified Death's Judgement. That should steady your health.
---
The other damage is likely to be the orb attack that follows marking of targets with a cone from Qadim. This can be healed through using the standard DPS rotation with Invigorating Precision. 
---
If you are still struggling, don't be afraid to run Marauder gear. Alongside the new DPS food (either the leach or -10% damage) you'll be pretty safe and still do more damage than a Scourge.
---
it has a small chance of giving [some charr-exclusive head skins.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Visage_of_the_Khan-Ur)
---
Nope. I needed the dark path for Sunrise's collection. Checked before reset. Checked after reset. Checked 3 hours after reset. All were dolphin path. Checked again around 8 hours after reset and it finally changed.

No, that's on opposite sides of the map. The gate you're thinking of is probably the gate to the [Cathedral of Flames](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Flames)

it's so cute!!
---
[Source of the meme](https://youtu.be/WUhOnX8qt3I?t=8) for those that haven't played much TF2 :)
---
have a few things to add.
---
1. as many have mentioned make all your toons.. don't have any empty char slots park them somewhere to get easy gold, plus getting more bday gifts is also nice.
---
2. this one not many people do, but i do it all the time its quite easy. Join guilds that have no rep requirements and allow all their members to start guild missions do the missions that are easy for you to complete solo for personal rewards, guild treks and guild races you can even do 1 target of a guild bounty if other players can help. 
---
doing this rewards you with guild commendations take this currency and check your guild hall guild trader daily after reset, buy wvw boxes these boxes reward random amounts of wvw exp, save the boxes till you get about 10 or then use them on days there is a daily for wvw lvler. it requires you to get 2 lvls in wvw, these boxes will get you that daily so you can start getting wvw reward track potions and start building towards gifts of battle if you ever make a legendary, the other bonus is the higher your wvw lvl the higher your pips while playing wvw will be which will help get reward tracks faster.
---
almost forgot, since you have joined a guild harvest guild hall daily and also get 1 of the buffs on all your toons.
---
hope thats helps some.

A thief without sentinel outfit ......is just not meta XD
---
It shouldn't, but if you're paranoid, there's no harm in waiting a few hours to a day.  The game will still be here tomorrow.
---
Telegraphing attacks is not a bad thing at all though. This boss was just designed terribly.
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
On a related note - what I actually came to ask funnily enough - do you happen to know if there's any benefit to buying PoF/HoT before I hit the end of the main game? - any extra quests/content to see along the way for instance?
---
I already have a legacy account as I bought the game a few years ago, only got to about level 40 though.
---
Mock not the divine image of smiling Colin Sohandsome, Conductor of the Hype Train.

Like when they released the first legendary back, and promised one release per year?
---
That looks like she is about to drop a massive [till-hammer](https://gfycat.com/clevervigilantatlanticbluetang).
---
no ballerina has a chest like that
---
It was designed for PvP -- like GW1 was. The competitive mode is separated explicitly from PvE, unlike in WoW where gear carries over between modes. The problem is that the energy they put into competitive formats simply diminished over time and their focus on open world increased. Maybe they just made more money in open world. Maybe important people left. Whatever the reason, PvP and WvW have been left to the wind.
---
Well apparently he did do some music for this release.
---
I no longer play gw2 actively but the last few times i casually dipped in ranked pvp people were super toxic and emotional. If i would want to bring more people into pvp i would make a point to be the opposite of toxic and help out beginners in pvp and create some sort of mentoring guild.
---
What?
---
Because DPS is king. It is literally *impossible* to clear many raid bosses if your DPS is lacking. The ceiling isnt high (around 50-80k dps sustained) when compared to raid comps but you running an open world build especially on support classes (druid, chrono, off healer etc) is detrimental to the group as the boons, up times, heals etc are required. You pulling 4k dps on a dps slot vs 15k can make or break a group as well, ex: make a no-updraft gorse into a required updraft which leads to less DPS overall which means you break slower to compensate which means you may not have the sustain to counteract his tantrum which leads to a 10 minute fiesta of trying and failing. You have to also remember there are *9 other players relying on you* which means you bring your best attempt and you play your heart out because *they are doing the same* not some half ass 3.7k toughness 2k dps build, you research and attempt the rotation to bring your best.
---
Eh, there's not much left that has no sink. All T2-T7 mats have a use. Most of the cores and such have a use too. Shame that so many PoF mats have next to no use, though.
---
lmao, downvoted for stating I like range in general.  I am gonna add that I think it's bad design that range has no place. Just because I like range in general in MMOs/RPGs doesn't mean it's dumb to check out if it has a place in GW2. Of course I'm not gonna play bad on purpose, even less so with friends, and it's condescending to suggest that's what I would naturally want. Nobody wants that.
---
So from this, I'll have to find a fun stacking/melee-heavy class if I want in on endgame group content. What would fit this (subjective, but open for suggestions), and have strong solo ability in open world?
---
Weapon?
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
It's because a lot of open world builds perform in like the 25th percentile.  People aren't saying that you should be doing 90-100th percentile DPS on a meta-build, but it would be nice if people were self-conscious enough about their performance to do 70-80th percentile -- or like 15-20k vs. like a 30-35k benchmark.  It's not really asking that much.
---
That makes sense - I'll have a look at the Revenant but from what I recall, I think I'd just want to use a base class anyways.
---
Thank you very much for your time!

I like seeing my title.

Your daily dose of retarded asura :D
---
This has nothing to do with SC or MB, ppl just expect you to do your best, cause other ppl are doing their best too or at least try.
---
This game has no real build diversity, the best options are usually pretty clear.
---
For example if you wanna play power necro, your obvious choice is to go reaper, power scourge works too to a degree but it's much worse. Going power scourge over power reaper is like picking a plastic knife over a steel one.
---
The whole mentality of raids is the same as any group activity. You wouldn't like it either if you'd play football with strangers and one of them would show up in slippers.
---
I used tempest healer
---
It heals constantly and gives boons when you apply auras
---
I enjoyed it in fractals, so i think it Should be also fun in wvw

---
 Nott sure about the healing, but if you commanding try chrono. I personally never tried it but I've known some fight commanders who still love it for commanding.
---
Correct, I realize how the tooltip works. the "burst" healing from spring on allies comes from Cultivated Synergy (which any healing skill will proc), beyond that it is cleansing/regenerating allies.  But because it applies the regen every pulse, if you stand in all pulses you still have 41 seconds of regeneration (with full conc gear) AFTER the spring expires (50 total if you count the spring time, which if it overlaps with a spirit they will get the full regen cause they don't run out of it, players will of course move as needed).  
---
In regards to quickdraw, usually I proc it when entering astral, or when I swap staff to 3-5-3 or 5-3-5 depending on the fight, so I don't proc quickdraw going back to warhorn, unless I sit in the "other weapon" stance for more than 9 seconds unecessarily.  
---
Warhorn 4 and 5 apply regen to 5 targets, so even just a 5man party + pet and spirits it doesn't have enough coverage for 100% uptime on everyone, spirits start dying if thats the only love I send their way.  With spring added to the mix, it can provide 40 seconds of regen to 5 target, (or if you have 10 standing in it, it will alternate who gets the healing so 10 people will end up with 20 seconds of regen roughly) and the skill is available again by then.
---
Water spirit proc in my full healing gear is 863 per 10 seconds, if you use the aqua surge activation it is 2205 to 5 targets within 360 radius (if talented) and a mere 2955 regeneration over 10 seconds to 10 targets in the same radius (NOT the same radius as its heal proc of 600).  All of this on top of the fact you can proc the self heal when you dont need it a majority of the time I just have had very poor results with it to date.
---
You know you can make him disappear, right?
---
These (I actually think 2, 3, and 4 are outdated issues, but still, it's an objective viewpoint I respect) are legitimate criticisms yeah.
---
The thing is, I think for a lot of people (like the original commenter) all these things are irrelevant. We ofc don't have actual metrics. But let's assume we're comparing two major reasons in leaving a competitive game mode. The first would be objective and fixable criticisms like the ones you listed. The other is more baseline, the player isn't enjoying themselves in a competitive situation, regardless of where this situation is. Whether it be lack of time, skill gap, lack of energy, the competitive environment, people being shitty, anything really. 
---
If we're talking a purely competitive game, like R6, then yeah I'd agree with you that they really need to get this objective shit nailed down hard. If they don't, people will start flocking away. In GW2, the veteran and hardcore playerbase are definitely still in that same boat. Players like (it seems) yourself get frustrated with this shit, and leave. 
---
However, the difference here is that GW2 is a giant casual MMORPG. The environment is completely at odds with the competitive mindset, including all the toxicity, botting, etc. A lot of people try to enter this competitive landscape and suddenly realize they hate it. But they're not hating the objective issues, and they don't leave because of balance problems. They leave because they're honestly not meant for a competitive environment. It's at odds with the rest of the game. 
---
It's toxic, people are afking, and people are botting (apparently). Common issues in any competitive game are suddenly being applied as to exclusive to GW2 PvP.  What's the problem with PvP? "Eh people are toxic. They called me names and blocked me." Bro, Garnett's been spitting fire since the 90's lol. I'm sorry, but GW2 didn't invent trash talk lmao. 
---
So now you got people (like the original commenter again) who just don't like competition in their free time (which is a 100% reasonable feeling to have) and they're applying criticism of the social reality of competition to the game. 
---
Tbh I'm not sure what the conclusion is, it's just the attitude and conflating of two different things, it pisses me off that they're lumping it all together.
---
Edit: Seriously, how can somebody in full seriousness say "The problem with something competitive is trash talk" like lmao did you not to to gym class when you were a kid.
---
Tempest would be difficult to command on, even with full minstrel you don't have a huge effective health pool and you are entirely reliant on group boons. I think you should stick it out with firebrand. That way you have all the cool downs right in front of you, have aoe heals and resistance that your party will have to walk through, plus a lot of blocks to keep you alive. It's absolute ass to play (been playing it since a few months post PoF) but it is without a doubt the most useful class to command on
---
Well with a name like Boris I can see pointing out facts wont work. Yes they didn't use questions in the announcement but they did for fridays guild chat, war eternal, all or nothing, I believe the cooking stream and the most recent raid stream.
---
Bug fixes are usually very leightweight. An image change probably isn't.
---
In case you didn't know, but there is only so much that can be done outside of scheduled patch times/days usually.

Sure! Send it to me, I find it relaxing to edit photos, especially after a stressful day at work.
---
I can't wait to find out which quaggan is their favourite.
---
[Scrapper Medic](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PegAo6lNw8YPMH2JeyTntaA-zVJYjRDfZkUBUdC47s43mF-w) is kind of ridiculously OP.
---
FYI: The most forgotten part of the build is Soothing Detonation. Every time you blast any field, you grant regen to 5 people near you. You only have 3 blast finishers, so identify them and remember them.
---
If you want to play Tempest, [Auramancer still works](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PGSAYlRwWYOsGWJe2SttdA-zVIYfUwXGBlAVXA+OL+NsB-w). You just need to remember that all of your utility skills are heals. Yeah, they do other things, but you need to think of them primarily as heals. Even the elite is a heal although the healing is delayed by 5 sec.
---
It's so ironically on brand for the way that Anet handle communication and engagement with their audience.
---
This. I made a thread here about that, having the concert implemented into seasonal events would be fun !
---
thanks! it's meant to look like the way she lands at the end of vault!
---
Why would we have questions about music or other trivial things? How about Anet responds to questions regarding the future of the game then we can go back to talking about trivial things like music and who’s everyone’s favorite quaggan is.
---
god damn. i wrote my own version of this moment but since the commander was a revenant (and thus could actually feel Kralk's emotions) was far more affected by the revelation. i still think you wrote this better.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Let me try to address these:
---
The water spirit does buff 10 targets, in my full healing gear it is 863 heal proc per target with a 10 second cd.  If we assume they proc it when they NEEDED a heal i believe it does surpass the spring!  But if they proc it and put it on cooldown while full healthy, it helps very LITTLE.  Also its activated heal/regen is a mere 360 range down from its auras 600 range, something to keep in mind.  And yes the glyph defniately has its uses!
---
"I'm not sure how you get to 100% boon duration..." I said 100% boon UPTIME, as in: having might, fury, regen, swiftness, etc up on the party all the time.  Thats all I meant by it :)
---
I did forget to mention runes, sigils, and food! You got me there.
---
There are a few fractals where I feel the pet dies a lot, the last boss of (I believe it is underground facility? the one with the ice elemental or dredge boss at the end) kills pets constantly, so I find myself swapping periodically to keep them alive.  But yes Electro is a definite alternative to interrupts I agree.
---
And to nitpick the nitpick, yes that player could've done what you said, but it was a pug so I have no idea what they might have done.  I used that footage because it was perfect for showing how the skill works to a new druid player, thats all, nothing more :)
---
This guide was meant to help someone go from "never played a druid before" to "could step into dungeons, fractals, and raids if they did their boss homework".  I did say during the vid it was for general use and there would be specific fights where you take certain skills over others for sure.
---
Amazing! I hope you do more!
---
Just a heads up, ANET is working on a WvW focused balance patch (dont have  link as I am also on mobile)
---
Some of the proposed changes will have an impact on current commanding builds... So depending on your gearing timeline and willingness to spend your liquid gold (maybe twice) it may be worth holding off on fully gearing your planned commander toon.
---
The way this game's mechanics work, if you're not in melee range of the boss, you're losing on &gt;50% of your damage, because you are missing out on party buffs.
---
So, regardless which weapon you're using, you're crippling yourself by not fighting from melee range.
---
These remind me of Destiny items ^^
---
Why do you ask for questions you don't want and won't answer ANet?
---
thank you!! i want to!
---
No. They're on the table^tm so soon^tm
---
Are the helmets account bound or tradeable?
---
Bought PoF from DLgamer without purchasing HoT and can confirm that I now have access to content in both expansions
---
yep :D i guess they forgot that one :D
---
Exactly, fashion wars. Was trying to say that the pvp skins are very much meh content, they cant stand up to the pve ones.
---
Not related to pocket raptors but that commander looks more like Disney's Gargoyles than a Sylvari.
---
Ah figured as much, I was watching all the NPCs return after the performance and initially thought the crowd Charr NPCs were shrunk before I realized I was the same and metal legion were just bigger. Thanks for the answer
---
Raids do this just fine.  You either get lucky enough to get the drop or spend 600 Gaeting/Magnetite + some gold to acquire the skin.  Here we exclusively rely on RNG and consistently getting a single rare for what's basically a daily gated thing feels pretty bad.
---
This is an unpopular opinion, but I appreciate these written guides over the wiki because I don't want everything spoiled for me the second I open the page. So thanks for making the effort to type it all out.
---
I doubt it even unlocks all three skins for use when it inevitably drops.
---
You answered. (shrug)
---
Dude I recognised your style from twitter a mile off, it's always a blast to see your art! Especially with dynamic poses like this!
---
You can work on making multiple legendary weapons by gathering materials over time.  This is just doing the four metas and praying the chest you get in the vault doesn't just give you a yellow.
---
Sorry for my wall of text on the phone is quite Hard to type (my main language on the phone is spanish so it tríes to correct everything).
---
I havent played that much WvW lately, but mostly heard about scrapper, not so much about antitoxin.
---
Im curious thought, hopefully you can tell me but do thief rifle stealth builds are as Well in WvW?, seen them in Spvp (enclosed small areas) might not even matter in WvW but i did read somewhere about the range of it.
---
oh sick, thanks dude! that's really nice to hear esp since I've been a lil art rusty lately!
---
So what, it's not content gating or anything. And in addition, it is sellable. So you can always get a guaranteed drop from TP, when they are listed.
---
 Thing is, if you chose a way of completionist, you accept the fact that expenses will be made.
---
I don't play mesmer so can't vouch for any of these builds but they will be at the very least a good starting point. 
---

Even if I did, it wouldn't matter as Anet will either cherry pick questions or make ones up to answer from either a generator or people around the office.

No.  Dungeon, raids, fractal, other LW chapters, WvW, PvP armor and weapons all can be earned over time by farming currency specific to the game mode.  Unique episode skins for other LW seasons have been earned either through collections or the meta achievements.  The last episode of season 4 had the armor acquirable through achievements and currency farming.
---
This prologue has a few items that are potentially an indefinite amount of time to acquire with the only way out is paying some other player who got lucky or who bought it super cheap and relisted for an extortionate amount of gp.  The chest they drop from, currently, isn't even worth opening as the keys are worth more than the single rare you're likely to get and few greens and blues you get from the smaller extra chests.  It's not even a gamble that's potentially worth it as you're giving up the keys which have a pretty good value attached to them for one shot at these skins per day.

I play staff/staff condi mirage for PVE, love it! Still going strong and can smash through core game enemies with ease, as well as take on the vast majority of expac enemies as well (just gotta be more thoughtful/careful)
---
What's the story? I actually feel like listening to a bit of drama.
---
Mirage is one of the best open world PvE specs. The more enemies to laser, the faster they die.
---
Here I am just bringing my baddie PvE hybrid mutt spec into WvW to go around and clear out veteran camps in a few seconds.

---
not necessarily bad/new/casual, when i am tagging with a zerg in open pve i use minions to compliment staff, i have my minions configured for cleansing/toughness/healing/life force regen. i just use staff aoe 1-4 for tagging and staff 5 and golem for cc
---
but i would never use minions or staff for anything hard/competitive
---
You can keep the same equipment (dual axes) and switch between chrono for fractals and mirage for PvE. They pretty much use the same stats. Check the Axe/x w infinite horizon build on the meta site /u/SARlAH linked
---
This image looks like it's been deep fried...
---
Definitely quaggan! This is so fantastic!
---
u/enaretos is just salty because he didnt win anything in cellos muscle shirt giveaway
---
Don't rush because I will guarantee you will be back here saying help me I rushed and I'm confused. Just take your time. I'm not saying your dumb but it seems to be a pattern new players come in they rush and they bitch on reddit saying they are confused.
---
Don't let your class force you to assume you have to tank. In fact, one of the best tanks in this game is the Mesmer and they wear cloth armor. And Necromancers are tanks all on their own!
---
This game, similar like ESO, let's almost every class do any role. Unlike ESO, it's not every class has every role but most do.
---
Some are just better suited to some roles than other. Like Guardians are better for support than a Thief. Mesmer is a better tank than an Elementalist. Etc.
---
Your weapon does determine if you should tank or not but greatswords are never, so far, considered a tank weapon. Unlike Final Fantasy where the two handed sword wielding Dark Knight is a tank.
---
As for tips? Well, enjoy the exploration and take your time. Don't rush to level 80. Play the game, learn the class, try everything out at least once. And DO EVERYTHING. Literally, if you see an event. Go for it. See gathering nodes? Go nuts! A map objective? Do that, too.
---
Just about everything you do gives you exp. You don't have to worry about builds until max level and even then you never have to worry about specing because you can always respec for free at any given time as long as you're not in combat. And by the time you reach max level, you will have enough points to unlock all of your basic skills and traits (which are like talents in WoW or in ESO's case, the passives in any given tree)
---
Elite Specs, which are kind of like secondary classes, are unlocked at level 80 and you have to have unlocked all of the core stuff, which you will anyways. Those are harder to unlock because they require a lot more points but expansion maps reward you with 10 points per hero challenge, unlike the core maps which only reward 1.
---
I'm assuming you have bought Path of Fire? If not, you won't need to worry about Elite Specs yet. And in that case, just enjoy the game for now. 
---
Also, gear is upgraded every 5 levels but you can easily do it every 10. But don't forget to do it. You can tell the difference in higher levels when mobs start to take longer and longer to kill if you do not keep your stuff updated.
---
Underwater combat has it's own set of weapons and helmet. And most skills work there but some don't, yet.
---
What underwater weapon is open to you varies with the class but there's only 3 of them. Spear, Trident and Harpoon Gun.
---
This is already getting long and I'm sure others will give you a lot more advice that I haven't!
---
You sound unhappy. That sucks.
---
"The High-Five Distance" 💀💀💀
---
I want to give my male norn reaper an ice theme too, but I don't really know what armour pieces I want to use
---
Oh damn! I'm cheap af but I'd commission you lol  
---
(can you link your sites?)
---
But the problem is you can't get started with the central tyria masteries before you do the prologue of either PoF or HoT.
---
I suffered from the same pop-up before, it would come up *every time* I gained even a little XP so I caved in and did the prologue of PoF to get the raptor mount, then went back to central tyria.
---
Everything's been said pretty much but I'll just say that I recommend doing the prologue of PoF cause it rewards you with the raptor mount which will help a ton everywhere
---
As a PvE player who has actively tried to get into both PvP and WvW multiple times, my experiences are consistently and wholey negative. Everything from the community vibe to the horrendously unfun gameplay, I am beholden to these modes only ever for rewards or achievements.
---
Well said, I just want to expand on some things
---
&gt;  In fact, one of the best tanks in this game is the Mesmer and they wear cloth armor.
---
Important to note, they are block/evade tanks, not facetanks.
---
&gt; This game, similar like ESO, let's almost every class do any role.
---
I just want to clarify here, this just means that every class has the ability to switch roles, not that every class is set up to run every role at a a time. So it means that you could choose to play a ranger and do dps, and with a few button presses you could completely change your role to healer. You're not going to be performing each role at the same time though
---
&gt; And DO EVERYTHING. Literally, if you see an event. Go for it. See gathering nodes? Go nuts! A map objective? Do that, too.
---
When we say everything, we mean it. All of the non-combat map related things: exploring points of interests, finding waypoints, looking at vistas, gathering materials, all of these give experience. Crafting gives experience, reviving people gives experience, and of course, doing heart quests and events give experience 
---
&gt; And by the time you reach max level, you will have enough points to unlock all of your basic skills and traits 
---
Entirely just by leveling. There are also unlockable hero points throughout the map too that you can collect to make things a little easier for you down the line.
---
But they'll hopefully go on tour one day, and those tours would probably be time limited.
---
Looks so good! Mind sharing the name of the pants and shoes?
---
You want to know why noone plays PVP?
---
Let me tell you a story!!!
---
So yesterday i finished my non repeteable reward tracks in WvW and i was like... Ok, time to try PVP!!!
---
(I have bear rank from core back when ranked wasnt a thing and never again touched it).
---
1st match was close but we lost (we ended with 480ish points).
---
2nd match we be playing and then teammate goes:
---
- Fight in point goddammut you frigging idiot!!!
---
- Me: (solo kiting 3 enemies off point) "i'm sorry it's my second PVP game i'm trying my best" (dies).
---
- teammate: YOU SHOULDNT BE PLAYING RANKED
---
- me: why not? Like i'm bronze and you are matched with me, so we are both trash tier and we can't drop lower, why are you so mad bro?
---
Anyway, we lost that one and of course i instaqueued and i got the same teammate who cries some more before starting and goes "oh report me if you want but i'm not playing with nubs" and leaves.
---
I reported and we went 4v5. Jokes on him because we put a hell of a fight and could have won with him (we got 460 before losing, the enemy team congratulated us!!!)
---
Next match was a complete stomp we won 500 vs 50 (i even checked for afk enemies but they were all playing).
---
Last match i played we lost with 350 points. I got my ass kicked pretty hard, and one of our teammates was very stressed (but NOT being an idiot). I asked what rank he was, he said plat3... I apologized and reassured i was trying my best but i could see the enemy outclassed me (and 2 others of my team). I didnt have much fun this one, i clearly don't belong in this rank.
---
Btw i got top kills and damage in every single game, and some other top stats too (except the last one where i only got top damage).
---
Problem with PVP in my oppinion is a % of the people that blame others for their lackluster skill. Maybe if Anet actually banned (or muted) toxic people you would have more people playing.
---
I only kept going because i came from overwatch and as a Genji main i already heard it all -and on voice-
---
PS: I'm not bronze i'm still unranked btw
---
Depends on the map. Jf I wanted to go for Aurora now, I'd be shit out of luck cause s3 is dead.
---
My main is a Mirage and I'm a fairly PVE content-centric player (I don't much care for WvW/PvP outside of collectibles / tracks)
---
Of all the classes I've played for PvE, Mirage has been by far one of the most technically fun classes to learn and master how to use. I would 10/10 recommend playing it if you're looking for something that is fairly involved. I can PM you my build later today (It is far from optimal, but a good baseline to work from)
---
"Your dumb" lol
---
WvW has struggled with rewards for long enough that this was a lovely surprise.
---
This release seems to have quite a lot of rewards, that's very nice to see
---
I'm not sure where you're saying its inconsistent. I said earlier that the reason was the attempted rmt. Dan said the main reason is the attempted rmt.  
---
The thing Dan said about banning Guild MM because of his name was just to point out to the people calling out the mall cop mentality is that the gw2exchange subreddit is Dan's. if he wants to remove someone, its his choice. Now has he ever banned anyone for not liking their name? No, he has not. Everyone on that list is on there due to suspicious activity when it comes to trading such as scams, possible scams, attempted rmt, etc or if their behavior has become disruptive where they were harassing other users.
---
Of course! a.e: You are a wizard, harry!
---
If rev ever gets GS, it will be for a mage-like spec dealing damage from distance, I can feel it
---
&gt; First; options. Explain to me how and why having the options to purchase the skins from a vendor for a currency dropped exclusively on the map and/or in the strike mission would devalue these?
---
They are intentionally exclusive by low rng chance. Vendor would literally devalue this item.
---
&gt; Second; Other LW maps had a clear-cut way to acquire the skins. These skins were either bought from a Task Vendor (A heart on the map.) for Karma+Map currency. If the skins weren't gotten in that way, they were gotten either via achievement rewards be it the overall meta reward or individual achievements or crafting. How would these devalue the skins if they were behind many achievements or a complex crafting recipe to make?
---
They are intentionally exclusive by low rng chance. Crafting/vendor would literally devalue this item.
---
&gt; There's not much in the way of skins acquired exclusively through RNG drops.
---
That's why it's literally not a problem when from time to time a little more exclusive than normal item is introduced.
---
&gt;  The keys are also worth way more than anything you would usually get in the vault as well which does not help.
---
It makes you play the content, because instead of buying keys you will play the metas.
---
&gt; Using this need vs want argument is just bullshit
---
Why?
---
I did also explain, in this lengthy stream, that he updated his Patreon page to match the community guidelines of Patreon and the Guild Wars 2 ToS.  
---
As of today, he's totally clean on all fronts and what baffles me is just how he made all that cash, when other players can't go nearly as fast. That's what I was showing there.
---
thank you! i really love this outfit, it feels adventurey but also has a lot of flowing impractical tassels that look cool when u flip

Could we get commissions in this style, this is so awesome.
---
...
---
Nice strawman, but they're not the same thing (and I have to think you know that, but here we are). What you're talking about is creating new armour sets for existing raids, what the person you replied to and what I'm talking about is making sure existing models fit on new races. To use your example, however:
---
When Blizzard released Worgen and Goblins in Cataclysm, both races could be warriors, that means all existing tier sets and armour pieces needed to be modified so that if it was worn on those races, it would fit them without massive clipping issues, which would have been the case if they hadn't bothered.
---
I like the idea of currency and vendor with gear. Pretty much the same as mine but you put it in the strikes which if we're rolling with "strikes are baby mote for raids" that it works great. Not even for a "better" gear because I think that many people has exotic/asecended gear but probably with not the right stats. So a vendor that would sell blank gear with all stats available. After playing the strike few times I do agree that it is very easy and not fitting for pre-raids stuff. But like many people said, ANet might have just do it like that to see how many people will finish it etc. The colossus is said to be back, -lore wise it will probably be a new one but whatever- I also saw that that_shaman's tweet with the model. So it looks like it will be harder [I mean right now, all you need to do is walk right into it]. The break bar should be there, yeah. Perhaps at 75% and 25% with a "longer" timer to do it just to let people get used to it. 100% it would be "remember to bring cc" before every battle in public runs but still. Hell even now people have problems with understanding that there is teleport they can use, every run there is at least 1 person on public that keeps doing JP and then lies dead while the rest fights the boss. I'm also kinda cool with tiers or simply a challenge mote but I do hope that ANet will not take away these cool, exclusive rewards from T1 then. Maybe just make higher % chance on higher tiers, but leave something to look forward to even on the easiest tier. Otherwise as you said, people will probably not do it for a long time if it's only blues and greens.
---
So to sum things up, I do agree that if strikes are meant to bring people closer to raides they need to be harder. But I do think that it should be done carefully, not sure if slowly because it all depends if there will be strike with each episode or not. If yes then the whole season/saga could be a nice experiment to see [I'll assume that ANet has numbers on how many people does the strike and how many were successful] how many people kept on doing and finishing the strikes as these were getting more challenging.
---
Race checkpoints in new map bugging, just like every other race.
---
maybe someday! unfortunately right now I barely have enough time to draw for me but I'd love to do commissions like this if I had more time!
---
Check youtube newbie guides, there are some pretty new ones that are nice.
---
Reddit also has guides.
---
Im still trying to get some more feedback for a "content" guide for newbies, but you can check my post (and the helpful comments) about it 
---

---
Why do you get so much endurance back after shattering? It's at around the 6 seconds mark.
---
Don't buy raids. You're better off spending the time and money gearing up a character for it.
---
&gt; As someone who has been a super casual player since initial release and only has like 13% map completion on one character, it seems daunting to get to 100%.
---
FWIW map completion can be done in [around 12 hours](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9xex1x/world_completion_in_12_hours_37_minutes_on/).
---
No. I’ve gone around. I played a little to Divinity’s Reach before I got overwhelmed with not understanding the questing mechanics. I missed the Lion’s Arch attack completely. Rejoined at the end of HoT and started it when PoF was coming out. Still haven’t gone much past the second area in there. I did all of the original patch of PoF and got the mounts.
---
I did all of living world season 2, a couple of season 3, and so far I’ve kept up on all of season 4 and just did the latest episode.
---
I spent a little time crafting. Early on I did a lot of battles and WvW before all of my friends quit. Been playing by myself since so I have no real ties to the game or help learning all of the stuff to do. 
---
Maybe that’s been the thing that makes it hard to really invest into? Playing solo gets kind of lonely.
---
On a different note, I'll be on holiday in Paris soon in few weeks. Any tips on good food, cafes or areas to stay in?
---
Official forums
---
yeah no thanks
---
have fun with the quaggan and aurene circlejerk. let me know when they plan on talking about things that matter
---
Well-spoken. I feel similarly about the [abysmally low drop chance](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/91924-Visage-of-the-Khan-Ur) of the Khan-Ur helmet, too. It's another minor slap in the face to endure. I get the need for prestige skins, but really..? They've already made an infusion, that's plenty for absurd rarity. 
---
I wouldn't even be upset if it dropped similarly to the Ebon Shoulders.
---
Sigil of stamina maybe? You get endurance after killing anything that isn't an ambient creature.
---
Probably the regain-endurance-after-killing-something Sigil, whatever its name.
---
I really don’t consider that time feasible for someone with no ascended gear, and not having 23 works completions of experience like that person has.
---
I also tried to play Chrono and realized I was horrible at it. I have one but I suspect I’d have to watch tons of videos on how to not suck and do it without all of the gear. Right now I play a Deadeye thief because it was my most used character (my guardian a close second).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/d5dxzp/best_open_world_pve_builds_suggestion_power/
---
You mean Night King.
---
Thanks! I have a lot to learn. I know there’s still stuff that pops up in game I can’t handle by myself but probably should be able to. Like single NPCs that give mastery points if you defeat them. I see people solo them but I can’t even come close.
---
When I was living alone I had the extra income to drop on the lvl 80 boosts so I think I have one of each just sitting there, and my thief is 80 with full unlock of deadeye and daredevil. I did craft the ascended staff at one point by buying mats from black lion auctions.
---
Compared to the RX 5700 XT, it can be called outdated. My phone is about the same age though :)
---
Cuz I'm using this build for raids and t4 fracs https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/
---
Originally did it for my reaper tho.
---
Though you may have had noble intentions with this stream, ultimately all it did was fuel the fire. People will look at this clip and other out-of-context statements and use them to "prove" that there is wrongdoing that merits him being expunged entirely from the game, reddit, and Patreon.
---
Is it really that fast? I’ve found a lot of masteries I can’t do solo if it involves killing something. Makes me kind of stuck in that regard. I do need to unlock the latest mount still and I don’t have mastered all of the mount features. I also don’t have the mushroom jumping maxed nor the gliding.
---
I understand that. I'm trying to set out what I interpret OP's thought processes to be in making this mysterious post.
---
Oh WvW counts towards it? That’s going to be rough.
---
Then join a training server in discord. You might not need the training, but you'll still be able to gather people around your skill level.
---
I’ve never wanted to down vote something so hard in my entire life. 
---
The post.   Not your comment.   I upvoted your comment.
---
GS is still a staple for quickbrand right? Unless something changed in the last patch.
---
My point being - if it can be done that fast, then it's not that insurmountable in principle. And with mounts and if you know your class well, it's already faster than it was for many.
---
The only question is whether you enjoy exploration (and simple gameplay) or not. If yes - it will be very enjoyable because environments are what ANet does best; if not - it will be tedious, but not difficult anyway.
---
I remember devs saying in one of AMAs, back when they were on reddit, that world map is such a convoluted spaghetti code everybody are scared of touching anything.
---
Yeah I find it has pretty good survivability, though I can only speak for PVE as I don't play PVP. There'll be upcoming changes, specifically for Chaotic Interruption, so it'll be interesting to see how that affects condi mirage n how to adapt to it.
---
I found axe/torch x/pistol fun too but felt a lot more squishy with that.
---
Gonna give chrono a go in the near future, it's been nerfed quite a lot the past year but should still have viable builds for open world :)
---
Oh, HoT map completion is different because most of the hero points require groups, but core Tyria is completely solo
---
Should specify qfb then, since you’re playing a support and not a dps (: but yea like others said, if you have some LI ( which I guess you have judging from you being at the last step of envoy armor 1) just join LFG for Xera. Unless you’re on NA, I heard NA is dead, not sure how true that meme is
---
It’s probably going to be easier than getting all ascended gear I assume. I do enjoy scenery so it might be fun once I really get started. Plus it would make getting involved in events easier when I have places to port to nearby everything.
---
Tip: Story mode counts as a path for this "achievement."
---
This achievement is terribly done. Shouldve been skins which can be bought with chilli. Idm the 3k gold skins with very stupidly low droprate. I mean its stupid af but cool, if its not in an achi idc... but this is just garbage
---
Oh excellent. HoT has been ignored because I’d spend like 30 minutes waiting for a group to help kill something. Seemed like a waste of time.
---
&gt; There'll be upcoming changes, specifically for Chaotic Interruption
---
Do you have a source for these potential upcoming changes? I might be out of the loop.
---
Edit: [Oh... I assume it's this?](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/83741/chaotic-interruption-temporarily-disabled-in-pvp)
---
&gt; We've been discussing changes to it, and this is not something that can be addressed well via a hotfix or as part of our short-term release. Changes are going to take some time before they are ready because they involve multiple traits and affect different game modes. Our current estimation is that the complete changes will be ready for the next balance update.
---
It did when I completed it. I've also been gone for quite some time and have only been back for about 2 weeks, so things may have changed since then.
---
EDIT: I have confirmed it is no longer part of it since March 2015. It was quite a while before that when I did it so I probably didn't pay attention or just forgot. You can rest easy now.
---
You can often find HP tours so they’re not that big of a problem. And crafting gen 2 legendaries requires HoT map completion (you can do PoF instead but it’s horrifically expensive and time gated)

It would have been better if there was at several chests around the statue that can drop the thing. Kind of like the chests in the Abaddon Shrine.
---
* 1 key: You get to enter the vault and open the small chests.
---
* 2 keys: You get to open 1 large chest.
---
* 3 keys: You get to open 3 large chests.
---
* 4 keys: You get to open 6 large chests.

* Donate gold to the statue for double tries.

Yup.

People are saying the last Windows 10 update seems to be the culprit, ive not found a solid fix yet however.
---
Really like the 3rd from the right! All are cool, though.
---
Am I having a stroke or are you having one?
---
I think people don't get what it is your complaining about and it is right it is annoying as hell and it should be treated differently and especially now when you get both expansions, it should be possible to play the first seasons and then go on with the expac stories without those constant reminders about mastery.
---
Is the Windows update affecting people differently because as I said my wife has no problems whatsoever?
---
I guess I’ll just wait for the next windows patch. Man why can’t Microsoft get their crap together?
---
Future episode releases? It is only the prologue
---
Water Spirit bad lmao. 10 man regen is insanely broken on something that requires actually healing to properly play.
---
The game is already technically getting visual upgrades with each new thing they add. But if you mean for core maps, I'd assume highly unlikely. The game overall has always been fairly pretty though.
---
&gt; Bro, Garnett's been spitting fire since the 90's lol. I'm sorry, but GW2 didn't invent trash talk lmao. 
---
"Bro", if anyone, including Garnett, said the things PvP players say *to his own teammates*, he would be off the team and out of the league so fast his head would spin.
---
You can tell people who have actually played team sports from the posers so fast. Posers say what you just said. People who have actually played team sports understand the difference between trash talking the other team to get them off their game and fucking spazzing out *on their own team* because they're too immature to accept a loss.
---
Yeah, Anet has this strange and nonsensical policy where they abandon content as soon as they release it in favor of new content.
---
ohhhh I might have misremembered that
---
I forgot that there's both the vault and the jp
---
I would like to have better fps first.
---
Nightmare fractals is on daily several times a week. Just check your tier 1 tab and join in one of those groups. 
---
If you are in NA then they usually do things after reset. But even then fractals pug groups are a bit of a wasteland in NA and you might have to add your group to get it going. I think NA have more static groups and why it is more empty. 
---
In EU there are pug groups up nearly always. Maybe not so much in the middle of the night but afternoons and evenings for sure.
---
I agree that it's a little odd. When they first spoke about Living World I thought they may go back and work all kinds of new stuff into their core maps as well as add new ones. That lasted for season 1 then they totally abandoned it. I'm guessing they didn't want to confuse new players with the ever changing landscapes, but who knows.
---
it's the magician legs ( buy in tp ) and aurora shoes ( buy for karma on all orr temples and arah )
---
yes, that thread, when she posted it and i linked it, it was locked
---
Can confirm, used to play perma-stealth mesmer in 2013. I would wait for a wall to briefly get knocked down, enter the keep, then sit in stealth for 10 minutes before whispering a zerg commander to come take my portal. It was absolutely unfair. Oftentimes people would suspect i was inside the keep, but there's not much counterplay to perma-stealth portals, so I'd succeed in taking the keep almost every time.
---
I'm sure we'll get all of the new faces/hairs etc that are race specific in a free update, like what they did with humans in PoF. 
---
It just won't happen in the prologue.

Sure, it's childish. It's also reality, and it's not going anywhere. It's the status quo. Not just GW2, it's just how people play. It shouldn't be part of the conversation when the topic is the community supporting the GW2 PvP scene. No community can "fix" that. What do we do with trolls? We ignore them. Complaining about it only makes it worse. Your feelings on trash talk are certainly valid, but it won't change its existence. If you'd rather play a different mode, good. But that shouldn't be a platform for change, it'll never work.

Oh, my bad. It seems I didn't read your comment right. 
---
Yeah, I think you have it nailed down. Personally, I don't see a reason to be quite so pessimistic as OP. I would expect at least one more generation of elite specs rolled out before the end. (Expac or no expac)
---
I don't really think it's necessary or even remotely important.

Some core maps, compared to some of the more recent maps, don't look as shiny but this game holds up really well for being released in 2012. Most MMOs don't overhaul their graphics much because they want to keep it accessible. Might get a bit of polish here and there with newer assets and art but that's about it. That's an advantage that games with more stylized visuals have over the more realist or semi-realistic styles.

I agree. Give it time, it will drop more often. Given that the strike mission can be done daily and is quicker and easier than any fractal or dungeon, it's a cool drop that makes me and my friends want to keep replaying the strike to get it some day. I'm patient, I don't need to have it in the first couple of days.

Surprise: graphics *are* content for many players.

Please no. It's not like the meta is going anywhere, can just go to the meta if you want it

So you came into this seeking a particular answer?  Why ask then?

And for the record Scrapper is an awful commanding class, it has terrible personal survivability to avoid pin focus.  Taking Elixir S (that midget-mode ability you mentioned) cuts significantly into your support ability so its a waste
---
Also you have the best kit in the world at peeling off stack to catch up people who are caught out of position to help them back to tag, not to mention having to constantly aim two cone skills at your allies for cleanse/healing (and do you have the micro skills to constantly turn camera while in front to do this? nobody really does)
---
Tempest is similar but almost even worse, due to overloads having the unfortunate ability of making you corrupt bait prime while you channel.  You also have no access to stealth, and severely limited support abilities while locked out of water attunement
---
There is a reason mesmer and guardian are the most popular and played commanding classes, because they are far and away the best at it and you are wasting everyone elses time playing other things.  Tempest and scrapper are perfectly good and viable as off-pin supports however

&gt;Claims are made that the quantity of items he gives away is greater than what is known to have been traded on the gw2efficiency subreddit. This leads to two possible conclusions. One is that he RMT'd to acquire the items, as in, he used his Patreon dollars to buy items from people. **The other is that his giveaways are fraudulent, as in, the winners are not random, and are actually his alts and friends/accomplices**
---
Oh shit!! 
---
It's  a good story. Thank you.

I've been running that shit daily and I've seen nothing but crappy yellows and a single exo that wasnt even level 80. I've got terrible video game luck and it's starting to show. ;\_;

Accidentally deleted my post instead of pressing edit :/

Sure thats my point. It's what people should do.

And then you get posts like these, where the topic is "Ways we as a community can increase PvP awareness and population" and the two responses in this comment thread was either "trash-talking" and other hallmarks of competitive online play, which is a pointless hill to die on; or stuff the devs should fix, not the community.
---
The only actually decent on topic idea I saw on this entire thread was the fact that there's no PvP equivalent of raid training discords. All this here, is just complaining. And complaining about trolls just makes the trolls worse, which if anything would cause more people to leave.

I'd go Gladines anyday if my Cholesterol wasn't so  Mount Maelstrom high!

Starting with subject 6 is not the norm since when? This seems a very bold claim to make.
---
 Every single pug group I've seen does it, every single not-pug group I've been in does it... usually one person goes and does the heat room while the other do subject 6. It may be (just checked: it is) the case that it's done differently in the extremely high end groups, but it must be said that these groups are not the norm and play at a level far beyond what most of us will ever reach, thus making their strats possible. Don't assume such strategies are the norm, because they are not.

Is there a way to do the shooting/firework events in Grothmar without having to use action camera? Toggled it off whenever it forces it on, but couldn't figure out how to then actually do the events. (Not a fan of action camera.)

Don’t you think 5 man premade teams in queueing would be slightly unfair?
