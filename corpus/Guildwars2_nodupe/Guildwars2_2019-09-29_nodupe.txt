Pretty sure I've seen some of those other skills in Torchlight and Archage.

---
---
Hey, at least someone is doing something with the PVP in GW2
---
You seem to confuse balance with nerfing something into the ground.
---
I'm calling fake!
---

---
A real kitty would have stopped to knock stuff off the cliffs and ledges.
---
Not really a class per se, but burning seems to be very powerful at the moment. Unless you have some strong condi cleanse, there isn't much to be done vs burning specifically.
---
I ran into some Dragonhunter witchcraft yesterday, where he would just stand in Foefire mid for solid 30 seconds and be invulnerable to anything my Scourge could throw at him. Without knowing how they work, should any class have invulnerability against condis for that long? He triggered marks but no damage, and I couldn't strip any boons because of the invuln.
---
And the double CC from Holo's seem a bit excessive but I guess it must be fun to play, right? Most classes equip a single stunbreak. If that one is spent in the first know knockdown, and the second lands, that's 5 seconds where the Holo (and anyone else) can mash buttons on you.
---
Other than that I only have small annoyances like a guardian/necro pull through half a map, or thief traps that kill you in 10 seconds from the condis. But those are I can live with, and I think I read that the new thief traps are getting tuned.
---
Can you tell me where you are getting the info that the scourge re-work is a direct result of WvW player feedback?  Because I can't even think of anyone who would suggest 10-target ranged AoE with one of the main damage sources in WvW is in any way a nerf.  I doubt it was fight guilds, because many are bored of the scourge meta as it is.  I doubt it was PPT guilds, because most don't use "meta" builds anyway and hate stuff like Scourge.  Genuinely curious as to who is giving this advice.
---
They would love to bring it back, but they can't figure it out a way to do it.
---
It was done not to be repeatable at all, and between old code and old tech messing with things, they would basically have to redo it from scratch, all except assets like audio and models, and that'll take time and resources they do not have yet.
---
Hello, I'm a student (last year of university) who knows some Node.JS, Firebase, so maybe if you add me to your private Github repository, I can help to port some code :D, Nice to see such a good movement keeps alive, good luck with your toddler!
---
Exactly, it's not like we owned the land, the Charr wished to pass so we let them, they tried to incase we crushed them and sent them back, I don't see why someone would call us a traitor. I mean there was Gunnar, but he simply demanded that they keep their war out of his hold and they did, out of fear or respect.
---
Damn, I’m a full stack developer but focus mostly on ASP.NET/C#/jquery so my experience falls completely outside the scope. Otherwise I’d be PMing you instead of commenting. 
---
Good luck, and ignore the haters. I’ve never had an issue with trolls or otherwise, and I tend to go overboard for my gifts. 
---
Thank you for all you’ve done!
---
I'm guessing that because this round of balance changes was aimed squarely at wvw, and the fact that a lot of players were complaining about scourge in wvw, most people made that assumption. Whether the devs said this verbatim, I'm not sure.
---
Thhats true, now I generally use heal brand cause its better but sometimes I get bored and play druid with no issues. But if Im being honest they usually end up being on the lower level of skill for pugs.
---
The prices began to free-fall in June. So let's look slightly before that to see what changed...
---
In late May, PoF metas gained Amalgamated Gemstones, and their price tanked in June as well. With double the sources of Amalgamated Gemstones in the game now, it seems there's a lot less desire for people to craft Amalgs in the Mystic Forge, leading to the drop in demand for Medallions.
---
That would be some impressive long-game manipulation xD  
---
But what I'm looking at is the opposite of the typical Pre-patch Cauliflower spike xD
---
obviously their problem was they stood next to the weaver, everybody aught to know, weavers do not do damage if you don't stand next to them. Although if you're melee oriented I guess you're kinda just in for a fun time.
---
I like how you run at that guy at the end like "YOU WANA GO TOO?"
---
I bought the runecrafters a bit ago and do exactly that. Around 1/50 or so greens don't have runes and they're very easy to visually pick out because they are trinkets. 
---
Even if you miss them it hardly matters, it's still only wasting 27c on a green here and there. 
---
Personally, I found the runecrafters quite nice to use. It certainly won't pay for itself any time soon like most convenience items. But I love seeing all those charms pop up now when salvaging. Especially the brilliance ones that currently sell for over a gold!
---
Fairly sure if it was an actual GM, right off the bat, there wouldn't be any talks in game about a ban. It would be discussed as a CS Ticket instead most probably.
---
Ignoring the 10 person resistance that warhorn warrior is going to give as well as 3 condi cleanse on call to arms.  Let's hope that doesn't become meta.  FBs still have tome #5 for 5 condi boon conversion and mantra.  Condi builds are going to be less effective against organized groups that run resistance since it'll be harder to strip with the boon removal nerf to necros.
---
Last guy: nope im out
---
Same.
---
Hey, I'm a dev here. Unfortunately, my main stack is AngularJS/VueJS, Node, MongoDB, Express, so I might be *just* outside your comfort zone. Either way, really awesome what you're doing.

No. If you delete all characters you will still have all your Masteries, Achievements, bank items, and storage items. Potential downsides:
---
* lose any bag slot Expansions. By default characters have the mandatory "Starter Backpack" and 4 slots.
---
* [Birthday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift). You characters will all be 0 years old. Birthday gifts are valuable for their Dye Reward Packs. E.g. on the 5th Birthday they get [Exuberant Dye Kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exuberant_Dye_Kit)
---
You can type /age to find out their ages. Delete the super yong ones and turn the old ones into storage mules. Btw Character Slots the most cost effective Gemstore Purchase for storage.
---
Thank you for the kind words :) since you &amp; Alechsnder have mentioned it, I've also bolded lifesteal.

If you really cared for max profit, you would extract runes from every green, then salvage them with cooper and handle the extracted runes separately with Crude Salvage Kit

Thank you for putting this together

I like the format perfect!

Every game-as-service like MMOs has a simple answer to the question of "Why don't they ____?"
---
**Sombreros sell better**
---
The second the people holding the purse stings thought they could make more money selling a re-vamped Season 1 than they could make with a fresh new saga you'll see it back in the game in some form. My prediction is that you *might* see a very scaled down version towards the end of the game's development life as one last big cash lure for the remaining core of dedicated players before the game is handed off to a tiny team of dedicated devs.
---
Or maybe that tiny team of dedicated devs will be the ones to reintroduce it.
---
Or NCSoft kills it like they did *City of Heroes*. Hard to say.
---
Doing literally anything except roleplaying will get you at *least* a few gold by the time the food buff runs out. You could eat this stuff during a core zone world boss train and still break even at minimum.

Not to hate on community organized events, but I was really hoping this was an official Anet post :/

I've yet to see a "new" player in the strike plus i always say "map/minimap" for that exact reason anyway AND say it's the shrine icon like dragonfall and siren's landing.

---
Concert is easily my fav event :)
---
Out of Topic : I kinda hope there is a bonus mini stage/event after 3rd song ended, like after we kill the boss we get 1 item "Big Fans", similar to item "Access Card", only 1 in inventory.
---
When we use that item, our weapon skills change to "Throw flower" (Similar animation like Toiler Paper). Or add bonus event circle like "Jump in the most pit" (Infront of Metal Legion) but with "Cover for injured dancers" mechanic, our utilities slots change to "Throw flower". We need to throw it to Metal Legion spot to complete the bonus event after 3rd song ended.
---
Other idea may be like "Sign my T-Shirt" or "Meet with the fans" Event when Metal Legion moving after 3rd song ended :)

This is what kills FPS the most and its why I get annoyed at posts like this. Yeah the game isn't optimized but you have the ultimate FPS killer on max. Lower it and you'll see your FPS skyrocket.
---
Explain why?
---
I'm pretty new-ish to this game and are currently leveling an Engineer that I plan to make a Scrapper... Is it worth it? PVE wise?

I find it ridiculous that this mechanic was introduced in the first place. We already have waypoints and contested waypoints which work just fine. Why does this need to exist?

Alright, cool! It did seem very hit or miss. Sometimes someone would say a name in chat, not base or anything, and by the time I'd looked up boss names on the achievements, it was dead. :D I'll see about getting into some fractals. That sounds the easiest, after those JPs.

Indeed, assuming it would begin on October 1st we would have.

There is however a grand total of no indication whatsoever that it would begin on October 1st. And it have NEVER started that early so no idea why it would this time.
---
The new Fresh Air Tempest on Tuesday will be better than lootstick ever was. 100% Overload Air uptime for tagging, and much more mobility than guardian, so you get to be at the very head of the zerg at all times.
---
I know, I know, you have to press 3 buttons instead of 1. But it also has much lower APM than lootstick did.
---
One reason is that you will have players with different settings in the same game, trading the same items and comparing the same achievements. Regardless whether you treat them differently or the same, it's bound to give grief on some side.

I'm in love with my or weaver, and I think I've found some good ways to incorporate a new setup that feels more comfortable. I definitely need a new mouse, my biggest problem is finding one with multiple buttons that fits big hands.

Wow, thank you so much! That's quite the commitment you got :D And yeah, it stings a little bit, but the positive feedback we've gotten (especially in this thread) exceeds the negative by far!

Wouldn't surprise me. Jormag was too far away (unlike Primordus) to receive fair amount of Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's energies so while he wouldn't be able to gift his Icebrood with those, or reanimate groups of dead beings, he must have enough to reanimate one.

I did! Ever since I’ve been away I’ve had 2 year 6 birthdays and my main hit it’s 7 birthday recently and now that I got my rig set up I was all excited to log on until my excitement went away. I just asked them if they can either remove the authentication associated with my dead phone number or change it at my request of either a email or my German phone number. They helped me removed a authentication on a oldddd phone number years ago so I don’t see it being a problem this time.

Gemstore is a web page, it costs very little to translate several pages.

There is a similar thing for vulkan: [d9vk](https://git.froggi.es/joshua/d9vk/-/jobs/). But since it is a more generic solution that translates all the directX 9 calls to the vulkan API it probably has not as good performance.
---
At this price point, go for the 580. They perform very similiarly but the 580 will benefit on games that have heavier textures. For GW2 the performance will be practically the same, it's a CPU limited game.
---
Technology isnt even spread equally within races.
---
In Elona you have human Holosmiths with lightsabers and humans who chill by stone huts and still use bow and arrows

---
Which GPU are you using currently?
---
&gt;I want minimum 30 fps while in WvW zerg fights/boss fights with high-highest settings.Is it possible?
---
No but your GPU doesn't matter much in that case, you'd be heavily CPU bound with any half decent GPU.
---
&gt;Which gpu works better for GW2 with these specs?
---
They both perform around the same in other games, so I don't expect them to differ much here.
---
Out of these two I'd take the RX580 8GB, it's usually significantly cheaper and AMD's driver is much easier to deal with (especially if you want to use Linux).    
---
I'd look at other factors too though like games other than GW2 you plan on playing, your monitor and its resolution.
---
What did they change in Kessex Hills?

Is there a risk of getting banned for using this?

If russian players really wanted to use profanity the'll do it in translit anyway. But hardly see anything like that in GW2. It's not Dota and CS, my friend.

---
- Why dont charr build air ships instead of still going for tanks?
---
Have you played Heart of Thorns? That's why. Airships are easy to pop.
---
- Why dont humans use computers?
---
Asurans aren't giving that technology away, and their council is very protective of their technology. Those computers likely also have some requisite infrastructure that human cities don't have.
---
- Why isnt everyone using long distance talkie walkies ?
---
The biggest reason is Taimi just invented them, and the Asuran council being overprotective. They already have waypoints, so it has always been easy to communicate. Societies in Tyria are also pretty small and self-enclosed, so there's not that much of a demand, plus there's already portals.
---
We do see instances of hologram communicators and golems being used to communicate as well. Dragon minions all show that there are magical alternatives as well.
---
- How come non mesmers dont use holograms for battle?
---
There are:Holosmith.
---
There are several instances of asurans using hardlgiht hologram emitters to battle. It's just that the technology is really on the cutting edge and requires a great deal of specialization and resources that might be better used directly, so asking why everyone else doesn't use it is like asking why we aren't all using quantum computers.
---
In the end, though, it's mostly because this is not a steampunk or cyberpunk fantasy world, but it is fantasy.

Check your GPU usage while in-game, if it's &lt;90%, a GPU upgrade won't affect FPS in that situation.
---
I got to lvl 22 so far but I can't find the damn Skyhammer map anywhere. I don't even know how to get to PvP. From what I understand there are some blue crystals but damn, I feel like I am missing something.
---
Yep. Plenty of stuff to do.
---
Today example: Why aren't Japanese toilets used as a standard everywhere in the world where it could be used? (That was my best example).
---
Globally, even when the technology is known and mastered (which is not always the case), there is kind of an inertia to use old and less efficient technology instead of an objectively better alternative. That doesn't seem incoherent to be the case in Tyria too.
---
Ha, at first glance looks like beach with hotel in the background
---
You get to pick some really expensive dyes from the anniversary dye packs, don't delete and it will save you thousands of gold just on dyes alone.
---
I disagree in this particular example, but not necessarily in general. For scourge in particular, I think removing this mechanic is just going to leave the class a broken mess in pve and pvp. That's not good game design at all, and as I demonstrated a few posts up, it's clearly possible to nerf it in a meaningful way in wvw without touching the mechanics of the spec. 
---
In some cases though, there are certainly examples where a particular design is just so overloaded and just does **way too much**. I think you find more obvious examples of this in games like LoL and MTG. There are champions in league that have had to have mechanics straight up removed from their kit because they do too much all at once. Champs like pyke are a great example. In mtg, there's a similar problem, if you compare the average standard playable cards rules text to cards from even like 2 years ago, the amount of text on these cards has skyrocketed. It's really weird to see. I'm not sure it's problematic in their case, as it also just increases game complexity, but power creep has been on the rise for sure.
---
That's why GW2 can't compete with competitive games; where having balance done by random players would genuinely be considered a joke.
---
&gt;A good resource, of course. The wiki is very good at what it does. Could some areas be better? Anything and everything is open to improvement in some way but if I don't have an issue with how things are being delivered on the pages I'm looking at, then I don't see a reason to personally edit it.
---
If you don't go beyond text information, you'll never find those problems, yes. The things I'm talking about deal with organization, templates, and the way the information is presented and prioritized.
---
These: [old](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Ascended_trinket&amp;oldid=1237498) - [new](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Ascended_trinket&amp;oldid=1387465) - [current](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Ascended_trinket&amp;oldid=1888754) are the kind of changes I'm talking about.
---
The "new" version had clamor to be reverted to the "old" version, and it would have been if it weren't for [ArenaNet publicly appreciating the changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4wvut3/big_shoutout_to_whoever_updated_the_ascended/). The lack of rules and guidelines means every single editor has a vision of what the wiki should be (player resource vs game documentation being the biggest clash) so many pages which are trash remain as trash forever, because no one can agree on how to improve them.
---
The cycle of the GW2 wiki goes as follows: page is trash, someone fixes it, someone doesn't like the fix, edits get reverted, page is back to trash. Most of those debating don't even edit anymore, they're there just to push opinions, which means they will never provide an alternate fix of their own. Mods aren't any better, since they contradict each other often as well, pushing different rules or ambiguous rules which led to conflict after conflict.
---
Here's another example, few years old: [public](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Armor_set&amp;oldid=1893168) - [private](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=User:Lon-ami/List_of_armor_sets&amp;oldid=1616523). That's one of the wiki's common "no one gives a shit to update them" pages, specially not the ones who clamored against the newer version.
---
You want to see drama, go to the wiki, search recent edits on talk pages, and enjoy your misery. You can check the public discord too, that's where the real trash talking happens most of the time, and the main reason why I left the wiki altogether a few months ago after the 100th pointless debate. I don't care enough to browse 7 years of edit history for my complete profile, even less for other editors who left years ago for similar reasons.
---
&gt; The ego problem comes from those not willing to help because they wanna do things their own way, and then pulling information straight from the wiki, forums and sub-reddit, rearranging it to suit them and then expecting to get money from it, either from donations or ad revenue. In other words, profiting off of other people's work by changing it just enough to make it your own.
---
That's a pretty shitty accusation. When Dulfy was still active, her guides were up long before the wiki had any updates. The wiki uses a lot of images from her guides too.
---
Early access for the partner program is a thing as well. Many of the weapon skin screenshots the wiki has come from the partner client. In the end, information is free, if people like an external resource more than the wiki, the wiki is to blame, not the external resource. You're doing something really wrong when a single individual is able to output better tools than a whole community working together.

Western half of the lake and everything north of it. Used to be just a lake and green hills. During season 1, the tower was build, and at the end of the episodes, it was destroyed.

I'm currently on my second G600 because, like you, I have become entirely attached to the third click button (I use mine for weapon swap and mount skills). I've also had the same clicking issues after a few years, sadly. I got my replacement on eBay, but as time goes on the prices for them seem to be gradually increasing. Unfortunately I haven't found any other mouse on the market with the third click and the thumb buttons as well.

Can someone tell me what config options are the most interesting when I have cpu/gpu resources _to spare_?  
---
GPU: ~40%  
---
CPU: ~60%  
---
RAM: 4GB left  
---
GPU Memory: 2.5/11.9  
---
=&gt; FPS: ~40

Hi there. It is available on the amazon UK, however, price with the shipping to my country will cost me 2x more than it cost me 5 years ago...

I'd rather not have random Cyrillic and I'm in the EU servers.

You heard it here first.
---
You can create another account and create a ticket to send them your details I had the same thing happen to me and they responded very quickly
---
Ah yeah, that sucks. They are awfully expensive for some reason, guess its such a niche. 
---
Alternatively you could try taking the mouse apart and cleaning the buttons with contact cleaner, sometimes gets a bit more life from them.
---
You're not alone. I miss the simpler days as well.
---
I wonder why they didn't go steampunk from the very beginning anyway, the art direction wouldn't be all over the place if they had planned ahead just a bit.
---
Have not seen it mentioned, but if your mouse allows try this:
---
weapon skills: qerfc
---
utilities: ~1234
---
attunement swap: mouse
---
I found that this setup works with pretty much every class. You don't need to reach for F1-F5. Every essential button is directly next to WASD. But you really need to get used to this setup + decide where you're going to put interact, weapon swap, etc...
---
I wish gw2 devs would play gw2.
---
I had to have them deactivate a authentication back in early 2016 when I moved and got a new phone number...and I believe it was the same case as it is now. I mean i gave them my PoF key and everything lol
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In Elona you have human Holosmiths with lightsabers and Photon Forge running around
---
There's literally only ONE holosmith int he whole game.
---
Amnoon should have had holo-neon signposts imo. Big wasted opportunity.
---
With only 5 thumb buttons and no 3rd mouse button? 
---
That's a loss of 88% of my buttons and I use all these buttons, especially for GW2.
---
I don't see how the G502 should be better in any way.
---
First year after the release there was not much of endgame in GW2 except for WvW, PvP and Dungeons and world bosses. This have changed dramatically with the expansions and seasons to a point were you now how more things to do both instanced and open world then no other mmo out there have. This works better on GW2 since they never add any new levels so we never really grow out of anything because of gear and level stay the same. We get statchanges and elite specs and mastery system instead.
---
So yes it is worth comming back. Get the expansions and season and you will have content for hundreds if not thousands of hours depending on how deep you want to get in to the game.
---
Right now its 0% effective against groups with perfect coordination. 60% against groups with perfect coordination would be a very generous number post patch maybe but to say that pre patch is just ridiculous tbh.
---
That's great! Thank you! There are so many people wanting to help out, so I'll probably open up the repo so those interested can do PRs. I'll let you know when that happens!
---
Nice! Thank you so much. ReactN is really cool. Even though it's a tiny library with few downloads/week, it seems great. I've been working with it for a few months now at work and we're just a month away from going live with a project. I will PM you with details and a Discord invite!
---
Thank you so much for saying that! Means a lot :)
---
Not everyone cares about collecting all dyes.
---
No it does not fill the same role as a weaver nor does it play the same.
---
Absolutely sad and pathetic that arenanet can implement this themselves. Bravo to you.
---
GW3 Amnoon will be Las Vegas.
---
So with the shader pop ins and portrait, do I just have to keep playing to let all the shader load in? If so, will the pop ins happen again if I relog into the game?

---
&gt;The new one not the one you can do only one time but the one after goes back to zero every day and this one was also reported about for a while.
---
Serious question: Does this actually happen? I saw people posting about it, but it doesn't happen for me or any of my guildmates. So i'm confused.
---
So much wasted money... And only 6 members, the insanity.

Wish guild halls were useful, but that boat sailed years ago.

Looking at the state of other competitive game modes  maybe that was the reason Anet killed it.
---
Yeah, figured OP would want an actual explanation over people just complaining though lol
---
And it's not the first time, we've seen this "issue" pop up again and again since pretty much release.
---
quite sad if true
---
Dear lord. Maybe try the action cam?
---
The more annoying issue is the new track going back to nill after resets. A lot of wasted progress for people that don't do a full track in a day.
---
Nice
---
I have the most potato of all computers. It's a laptop. Would this work on a 2016 MacBook Pro? It's on OS Sierra atm, lots of game glitches like maps not loading in, camera freezing, a general fps of 12 (PoF) to 20 (anywhere else) :&lt; 
---
Also don't judge guys, I'm a broke student and this is the only computer I got (a gift from parents, but I'm working on saving up for a better one because this sucks).
---
Appreciate the hard work!
---
Last update didn't work with ArcDPS's latest update, but i found a work around by installing the non-standard debug edition (no idea why it worked, but it did).
---
It appears none of the standard/non-standard options are working with ArcDPS in this update.
---
My game won't start (after I hit play on Launcher, nothing happens) if both dll's are installed. If I change ArcDPS to d3d9.dll.bak, the game loads fine. Any idea why this may be?
---
What does BiS mean?
---
Nice outfit, cattle
---
You can do this with any tonic in any form/race. All that these things do is either for show or makes it easier for you. Everyone has the same hitboxes no matter what.
---
I for one use the giant Nuhoch tonic and kite to be obnoxious if there are a lot of jumpers around and to confuse people on how I do JPs so easy. Pssssssst FPS mode makes JPs a joke.
---
Can anyone let me know how this has worked for them in α bottle-necked system? I have α 980 Ti which should have some resources to spare but I doubt my i5-6500 does.
---
no more legendaries, more sources for amalgamated gems. it's that easy. same reason MCs are dropping quite significantly. there is no further attractive use case expected for these items before a speculated S5 trinket, so people have little rreason to hold on to them.
---
Best in Slot
---
&gt; City of Heroes
---
Never forget.
---
On the other hand, GW1 has been in maintenance mode for over seven years and no-one pulled the plug yet. Reason for some hope.
---
With the rest of your post I also agree. Money talks, and for as long as Anet is focused on growth and continued support und development of the game, we're unlikely to see a S1 revamp. Not impossible, just unlikely.
---
Dervish/Paragon?
---
Yeah thats what I thought as well.
---
Ooh never heard that before. I thought Berserker Infusion Stat, or Best Infusion Stat, but very confused because the letter I is not capitalized. Thanks
---
Are you doing the first one or the repeatable one that you unlock after finishing the first one?
---
Don’t worry about the hater, friendo; you’re not the only one who adores this stuff. Travel in GW2 was already so nice with the WP system, but gliders and mounts have made it incredibly fun to scoot around wherever I please in whatever way feels most enticing atm. It definitely helps keep travel feeling fresh, interesting, and just straight up enjoyable. 10/10 would unlock mounts again
---
Anet tends to nerf core classes if there is something in core traits what makes an elite spec OP, sacrificing the core.
---
salvaging still gives luck. sounds more like you have some stacks out of view in your inventory that your essences go into, and/or you're only salvaging whites.
---
F you. for getting me so excited we'll get something new for halloween. really got my hopes up. then i found out its some shitty community driven event. really. can't you at least make add ( COMMUNITY EVENT) at the top of the page?
---
It hasn't been approved by arenanet, so you could theoretically be banned for using it.
---
Focus is more defense based, you've got projectile reflection, projectile destruction, earth armour, fire aura....I'd personally choose that over dagger OH.
---
They should have moved the activities to actual PvP.   Letting players set custom arenas with activity maps, and having a proper activity queue.  
---
Talk with an activity NPC, you can get an explanation about the activity, and are given the choice between the NPC opening the PvP panel for you, or sending you to the PvP lobby.  
---
Then you'd have a choice between going to custom arenas that have picked an activity as the current map, or go to the main queue, click a new "Activity" toggle button there to put the queue panel in Activity mode, and queue the same way one queues for rated matches. 
---
The queue would work like the ranked/unranked queue. Queue, pick the map when teams are formed, and give PvP participation in the activities.  
---
For example, the queue could attempt to collect up to 20 players. If players pick a team game like Basket Brawl or Keg Brawl, then the 20 players are split in two matches of 5v5. If they pick Southsun survival, Crab Toss or Sanctum Spring, they are put in the same map.  
---
If not enough players are found, the choices for maps would change based on how many players were selected.  
---
And there could be checkboxes like the Stronghold/Conquest checkboxes in PvP queue, letting you choose between solo activities, team vs activities, and both. 
---
Activities available only during festivals could be made available all year long with this method, and get their own achievement categories if they don't have them yet.  
---
Also, while queued Activity matches would not give league progress and pips, they could still give some PvP reward track participation and PvP rank points. 
---
There could even be mini-seasons and tournaments with activities.
---
Did you check any [price comparison services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_comparison_service)?
---
You'd get the same fps if you had a 2080 ti in there.
---
Agreed.
---
You'd get around the same fps if you had a 2080 ti in there.
---
That's so dope.
---
No, i already checked. If i break any item from green to orange wont give luck to me, but if i break ectos will pop some
---
There are definitely some points of the mastery system I’m not a fan of (the uselessness of all HoT and LS3 masteries aside from gliding). 
---
But the mount systems in this game along with their masteries are fucking phenomenal. Love how the mounts work here, best of any MMO no doubt
---
No, the mac client is OpenGL. DirectX is Windows only
---
Clinging on that one dye slot you will never need or use over one slot is unreasonable.
---
Ironic, given the Mexicans were here first.
---
You hit VRAM limit, change some config values or ingame settings.
---
Yes, it should.
---
The only reason to ectogamble is to get the kit. Once you have the kit, the only use for the kit is to sell things.
---
Anything else, and you might as well just destroy all your wealth.
---
I haven't tried Logitech G602 myself but it seems to be a sort of hybrid of the G600 and G502? So maybe try that one in a store if you can. Not as many buttons as G600 but more than G502.
---
Then you fall under the first category!
---
Check that you have only single dll for everything, no extra dlls named like old\_d3d9\_chainload.dll
---
ArcDPS loads every dll, making game crash in there is duplications/unintended ones.
---
And OFC, follow troubleshoot guides on readme.
---
Again, Furry is just as much an option as the other one.
---
Genocide is forgivable when you win. Unforgivable if you lose. See - The history of the world.
---
hey! fuck you too! :D in the bu!!
---
Yes, solo effort.
---
I break down 100s of blues/greens a night and have had no issue getting luck.
---
Hm pretty sure I've removed all the old ones. The only other DLL outside of the ones installed today via the update + arcdps/build templates is something called CoherentUI64.dll. I'm not sure what that one is for, though.
---
I'll check the readme. Thanks
---
o7
---
^ Prioriy purchases right there.
---
Save it until u need something. Maybe you can use it for getting the gold for griffon or skyscale. Or maybe for an character slot or bank space, yes. But if you dont know yet, just save it.
---
I have tried only yellws and orange. Might be that the issue? Still i remember they granted. These items are beign obtained as map rewards or rare doble clicking rare savage materials stack
---
Did so for me 4 days in row and guildies and friends saying the same thing and stopped using it because it is a waste of rewardtrack since you never get to the end. Well unless you play enough one day to do a full reward track which i did one of the days and why i did not realise it first. Then i checked every day after that and it was zero the day after.
---
Wow nice! Would be really interested in seeing if the perf benefits translate to wine
---
This is what i think people mix up. The first one works fine which is the one were you get the emote. It is a one time track and when you finish it you get the normal endless map reward track as you do for the other maps that is repeatable. This is the one that resets.
---
Oh God please no, I'm still busy with runes and sigils and goddamn that raid-locked ring that I'll have to get at SOME point. I can't deal with another pile of legendary equipment right now.....
---
Thanks so much for your continued efforts. 
---
&gt; There is a custom shader that removes bloom [https://pastebin.com/UtvHPBmY](https://pastebin.com/UtvHPBmY) put that file into d912pxy/shaders/hlsl/custom with .hlsl extension, and then remove d912pxy/pck/latest.pck 
---
What am I supposed to name the file?
---
Guessing you don't take part in Christmas.  
---
It's just a means to fun for some :)
---
I'm rich by no means, I think I have 80 gold.
---
I don't know, i can't get 70-90 fps while in fractal boss fights even on all lowest. I just wanna play at least on shader and shadows on max.
---
eGPU fix is amazing. Thanks so much for the hard work!
---
hi i am happy for new content and i think its a nice vid. You where asking for feedback so ill give you some: you dont use your weaponset to its full potential and you tend to play with the same strategy vs diffrent classes. Often you do skill nr 5 on your target then dodge backwards not hitting your target and using 5 on target again (you should dodge into your enemy not away) and you spam that a lot regardless if you need it or not. You never use skill nr 4 and 3 even though they are really important. You can cancel the backwards roll animation of skill 3 by jumping wich makes it very valuable for you and it doesnt have a huge aftercast like skill nr 5 does.
---
I did the troubleshooting steps that you had listed, including deleting d912pxy folder and deleting the bin64 folder (and reinstalling drivers etc.) and the problem persists. I've created a bug report on your GitHub with a full description. For now, I'll revert to debug mode on 1.7.1 as that seems to work.
---
Also note that this issue occurs on my laptop (that my wife plays on) as well as our PC.
---
Probably the same reason not all humans posses technology and why there are still tribes in many parts of the real world.
---
I spam '1' a lot and still have placed it on the side panel of my Razer Naga. I don't see why you would want to place it somewhere else.
---
&gt; For the most part, Asurans didn't permit other races to study at their colleges 
---
Except that they do. It's not a hard set rule to prohibit anyone. They just don't think anyone is smart enough to do so. But the moment someone actually is they do allow it.
---
Scarlet Briar, the antagonist of Season 1 studied in an Asura college and had an Asura mentor.
---
&gt; They are more widespread than any of the other playable races 
---
They were. They're not anymore. They only have one nation which is Kryta and they only live around there. Go beyond Queensdale and all you find are small settlements and most of them are Lionguard outposts.  Only other area where humans populate is just outside of Lion's Arch and Lion's Arch is not a human city anymore. 
---
Sylvari inhabit all of the Tarnished Coast along with Asura. Norn all of the Southern Shiverpeaks. And Charr have all of old Ascalon and past the northern Great Wall all the way into the Blood Legion Homelands and, assumed, towards the east to what should be the Ash Legion Homelands.
---
Infinite usage tools (mining, lumbering and foraging (in that order)) and copper fed salvage kit are my go to.
---
I would agree if the horizontal progression actually made an impact. Masteries are pointless because inevitably everybody will have them, and since we only get one per episode then there’s not even choice involved with what you prioritize. Elite specs are great but apparently the devs can’t even commit to giving us a set every TWO YEARS. Imagine if league of legends only released a champion every two years. The cost of the lack of a vertical progression system is that we ultimately just spend a lot more time waiting for new content to be spoonfed to us.
---
thank you very much ^^ I will try to improve my gameplay, didnt knew the skill 3 animation cancel for example, going to try it :D
---
I hope you will be happy with me getting better the next time I upload :p
---
ty!
---
Have you played both? You sit at range, deny areas, and bomb chokes.
---
Readding Zepherite Cliffs was a really good move, so I strongly disagree with you on that.
---
Last night, I spent several hours just flying the griffon around. Started out by doing that griffon adventure south of the skimmer ranch 'cause I happened to be there and then... just kept flying!
---
Heart of Thorns comes with Path of Fire, so there is no way to just buy one.
---
&gt; Deals 325 damage and heals 325 health on Critical Hit, 2 second cooldown. Damage and healing are unaffected by attributes, and cannot Critical Hit.  
---
Yep, increase dps and healing by 162.5/sec, totally relevant numbers!
---
Very few people train raids. Yes theres an entire guild dedicated to it on each server those runs fill up quick. Those in LFG are either A. A newbie "Pugging" raids with a slim chance if none of killing or B. An actual experienced group looking for a few more. It's even worse trying to get into CMs in fractals as it's a crap shoot and even then no one knows the tricks ( the siaxx kite, phases, shield, red orb negating) for newbie groups and the chance of clearing is yet again going to be abysmal, especially without kiting and orb negating. Theres a lot of value to a guild, especially one that is in line with what you like to do and has the players and resources to help you.
---
Im in for it, they really need to adjust a few numbers and overhaul a few achievements.
---
Hmm I'll give this a try, but generally it seems that the drawbacks for these workarounds will be an issue in any time sensitive combat scenarios.
---
The price of PoF didn't change, they just bundled in HoT for free. You won't be overpaying if you buy it.
---
You’re buying path of fire and HoT is free, so £25 isn’t the value of both expansions - it’s the value of path of fire
---
i wish i didnt get that useless currency
---
Am I the only one who totally like Bitterfrost Frontier map and its events? 
---
The rest of LWS3 feels shit compare to this map, at least for me
---
Dear,  **ArenaNet**
---
We love Guild Wars 2. Everything  is all right.. but we want  a little more -  Cyrillic..
---
I played back in 2016 and bought HoT, I only want to buy the second expansion now :)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Essence_of_Luck#Acquisition
---
I wish I knew more about it. I stayed there only for achievements and left. no reason to go back.
---
The Raid community in gw2 just has become extremely elitist and toxic. A ton of Squads require Li not possible for anyone who doesn't raid since months, making it near impossible to get in, without a commander saying "Ping Li or kick, you have 20 sec". 
---
(I have ~700 LI and ~200 Ld but I stopped raiding months ago because it annoying to deal with the players who play it.)
---
I am using the first version of g502 for years and don't really think I can change it for another model. So good.
---
Let me rephrase: readding is good but the real bad move is removing content in the first place. We waited 6 years to get the rumble back when we should have have got it at each Halloween iteration.
---
Some Logitech models have 3 years warranty and it is valid if you contact global support. They ask for invoice/pop and often send you a replacement free of charge. Please check purchase date of yours. They also offer you a selection from newer models if it is over service life.
---
It's easily my favourite LS3 map.
---
Siren's is okay. Close second if you ask me, relatively solid material farm and decent backpack items. Good for backpack farm if you don't have multiple characters and excessive time for bitterfrost character-cycle berry farm. Lake doric isn't that bad too, with jade and leather farm.
---
Other three are pretty bad though.
---
AND only ONCE a week, as opposed to twice as the rest. I hoard achieves, but gave up on Keg Brawl exactly for this reason and nothing else.
---
Remember when ANet was trying to push it as esports?
---
You put way too much effort to prove me wrong than what would happen in the game.
---
That's awesome! Your work will be appreciated definitely
---
That something I can agree on.
---
But sadly I have no hope for something significantly new being added to any Festival, when you take a look at said Labyrinthine Cliffs, they only added a couple of weapon skins to it this year, so I woudln't be surprised if that's what happens with Halloween as well.
---
May be true. When I raided, I didn't pug, but just joined my guild group.
---
I just didn't find the mechanics that interesting, and the way combat/roles are structured in GW2 weren't conducive to good raiding imo, and add that onto a lackluster reward structure, I was just uninterested.
---
As an avid lover of Kegbrawl I gotta agree with you 100% that it needs works. It can be pretty glitchy but underneath that is a very fun team game with a lot of wasted potential.
---
Then you may should try the G600. :P
---
Keys 1-0, F1-5, special action key, inventory, TP, lfg, F11 (options), autorun, Hero panel, map, guild panel, TS mute/unmute, I have literally everything on my mouse except for WASD and Jump and it's sooo comfortable. Even when I buy something in TP I mostly use my mouse to type in the numbers.
---
Maybe the first habituation isn't a thing for everybody, but if you are into it, you don't want anything else. 
---
Since it's hard (expensive) to get the G600 in EU, I'm looking for an alternative for a long time, but sadly I haven't found another mouse with 12 thumb buttons + shift-mouse button.
---
Or you could just kill the critters :p They're not that tough, a decent burst damage power build will basically delete them from the world with very little delay.
---
While I generally agree with the assessment regarding masteries and exploration, I find that Anet sometimes overdoes it. I am still missing about 20 Mastery points from HoT, because they are hidden behind collections and minigames called adventures. I can assure you, the easy ones I already did, the rest is highly annoying to me. 
---
Highly annoying l. In a game meant to be played for fun.
---
The idea is solid, the implementation in more than a few instances is IMO plain bad. 
---
I know collections are supposed to keep me engaged with the game, but they send me to places I've been already, fighting enemies I've visited already, filling hearts and doing events I've already done. Look, I'm already playing the game, and I won't stop anytime soon. But these 20 missing mastery points are not going to be fun. They are a chore to me. They do not keep me engaged.
---
And the adventures? Usually you do them alone. In an MMO. Does this seem right to you? Regardless of whether I fail the scrap rifle test for the 100th time, that doesn't matter. What matters is that this is time I spend alone. 
---
I am not sure how other players think about it. I can't imagine people thinking this kind of thing is a good design idea. I just fear for the day a competitor comes along, whose design is more solid, where the question "is this fun for the players?" is always the first one asked.
---
Certainly it would be used. Looks great so far!
---
The logo at the top that reads "all for fans" reminds me of that official GW2 merch store that doesn't have a good rep, IIRC. Maybe just replace all the text with "GW2FANS" ?
---
I really like the proper fullpage picture gallery where you can switch to next image.
---
The scrolling background image is distracting. Also, it ends too soon and the dotted pattern is... unfitting.
---
Underlining unclickable text like that is a bad idea. Those who remember the older internet would confuse those for links.
---
I like that the UI is clean, but maybe too clean? Could use some icons/colour for visual cues. Structuring and formatting is useful, but could be more, IMO.
---
I like it, it looks very clean! I’ll be checking out this site in the future for sure.
---
Spread this info through out map chat and other parts where the community might read about it so you get support. Dulfy didn't do it alone, she got info from most of the player base so she could created the guides fastly and effectively. I'm sure a lot of people will help you if you advertise yourself.
---
My opinion is Siren's Landing &gt;  Ember bay &gt; Draconis Mons &gt; Bitterfrost Frontier &gt; Bloodstone Fen &gt; Lake Doric.  
---
Bitterfrost for me has two problemas: The big areas that have no reason to be visited outside story, and the spam of freeze (not chill). Other than that, yeah it is a pretty enjoyable map.  
---
Every map on S3 has something pretty .....ugh pretty bad. Siren's Landing has less of that, pretty solid. Ember bay has some cool things like the skritt stashes, but jade constructs and chalice of tears on the other hand. Draconis Mons has, as negative, the bosses and the fact it is a nightmare to walk around without mounts. Oh and the PTSD from the backpack. Bloodstone fen can barely be called a map, it is so smoll. Lake Doric has .....everything wrong. But mostly the annoying centaurs, the annoying white mantle, and the hearts that take forever to complete.
---
don't try to be a Dulfy, just be yourself
---
rly nice work
---
There is never enough sites like, this. I hope You will succeed. Crossing my fingers and waiting for more good content! I suggest you to make some screens, copies and in year or few You will have oportunity to look back and remind those hard begginings :)

I don't have much hope either but who knows? They added SAB back in 2016 and the Bazaar in 2018, so maybe they'll update one of the festivals next year.  
---
Too bad for them they started a small storyline with Halloween, now people want a follow-up, which means extending the content.

Hello,

thank you very much for points. I am still beginner in creating websites. I will try to focus on it. Thanks.

Copperfed salvage o matic, storage expansion, character slot expansion, in that order.  
---
- Copperfed salvage-o-matic is the number 1 QoL item in the game. 
---
 
---
-Storage expanders may not seem super useful at the moment but once you start crafting your own armor and weapons be so happy to have it. Your ascended gear is going to have recipes that require over 1 stack of materials, it's a godsend down the road.  
---
- If you buy bank tabs you're just going to throw more useless shit in your bank, trust me. An extra character slot gives you more slots to store a bunch of random stuff when you throw in a bunch of 15-20 slot bags on it than a bank tab, and it's an extra character slot so you can play the story for a different race, try out a new class, etc.

I've had success with condition builds (most recently with my Soulbeast). I just dump a lot of condition skills on the area, then start harvesting. By the time I'm done, all the enemies are just about dead, allowing me to mount up again.
---
The bouncing chests do have a maximum of 20 but after that maximum the contents go into your inventory, not get deleted. If your inventory is full, i believe they continue to stack up endlessly in an invisible queue and will be dropped into your inventory when possible.
---
Because the contents begin to go into your inventory automatically after a point, the experience associated with some of them that you're concerned that you lost was already awarded to you.
---
You can also use some to craft food if you do raids/fractals as this episode introduces an strict equivalent to the non-ascended best power food with [Plate of Spicy Moa Wings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Plate_of_Spicy_Moa_Wings). It's nor really a bug direct spending but always useful for some people and worst case can always make you some money from chilis.
---
My purchases along the years were, in order:
---
\- Bank tabs (4 of them);
---
\- Infinite salvage kits (copper-fed and silver-fed);
---
\- Infinite gathering tools;
---
\- Shared inventory slots.
---
So, basically, what everyone else is saying.
---
Bank space seems to be the first shortage people run into in this game, so I'd also start there. Gathering tools are quality-of-life improvements - you can manage without, it's just better with. Shared inventory slots are added convenience that you did not have before, and they are super easy to get addicted to (you can always think of something else that every character could find a use for), but at the same time are less of a requirement than the two before.
---
Shared slots synergize nicely with, e.g., the infinite salvage kits - all characters now have access to them, even bag-opener characters if you have one (which you should). I think it's a winning combo for your gems.
---
I don't care much for fashion wars so the only time I bothered with skins was Strider's (medium) armor, and the shadow assassin + belinda's greatsword combo (full ninja look) - only these in 7 years of this game.
---
Bag slots never appealed to me mainly because they only benefit one single character. I prefer items that have account-wide benefits. Season 3 has a collection that will give you a 34 slot bag and, as others have pointed out, buying a new character slots technically opens up more slots-per-gem than anything else. Added benefit: those characters will now get birthday presents, that often have valuable boosters and other items. You can also park those characters in specific locations (end of JPs, or next to chests) to loot daily and make money off of it.
---
Finally, the PoF prep pack is a good deal, though it costs more than 1000 gems. But worth looking into.
---
EDIT: I ALWAYS wait for a promo for whatever I'm wanting. If you're not in a hurry, I recommend you do the same. Eventually, everything was discounted.
---
Fairly sure it's less than 20 most likely 10 as all of my T4's dont stack, I usually end up with a few in my inventory when T4's are done.
---
Anyone else running into the issue with this latest build taking forever to build caches and load textures and whatnot?
---
Took me about 8 minutes to load in textures for aerodome. Here's what it looked like around 6 minutes still: [image](https://i.imgur.com/Ihd9K2q.png)
---
Specs are:
---
* Intel i5 4460 @ 3.20
---
* 16.0 GB DDR3 @ 666
---
* GeForce GTX 970
---
* Samsung SSD  860 EVO 1TB
---
The previous builds didn't take more than a couple of minutes tops so I'm just curious if this is happening to others
---
Keep up the good work! The UI sure is secondary to contents of a guide, but it does improve the experience. And the guide's already clear enough and perfectly usable as is, so there's that :D
---
The veteran trolls with their bullshit freeze/launch attack. Even if you interrupt their channel, it will still activate when it would have.
---
https://flic.kr/p/PWQ6mF - From Myanmar, so we'll have to wait for Cantha to see this.
---
Yeah i originally wrote 8 and was convinced that it was 8, but i checked the wiki afterwards and it says 20. It's possible that the wiki is wrong.
---
The thing with T4s is that you "zone" between each fractal. So it resets the stacked chests on your screen beyond the 5th. Which is what happens if you have 20 chests -&gt; zone -&gt; 5 chests left to open, but only 3 "visible" at a time.
---
and that's precisely why in game design fun content must go in pair with good rewards or it's barren
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I really appreciate it. Thank you. I am still at very beginning so every point is important for me.
---
But everything you've said is relevant to a Chinese mobile ripoff! Let me tell you, you are God's gift to the universe! Everything you've said will herald us into the new era of technology and isn't stating facts out of place in any way!
---
Definitely will. Thank you!
---
Thank you for your kind words :).
---
Selling the macbook should cover about half the cost of a decent pc
---
Nice website\^ I'd suggest adding more games to the site if you can, only content you'd have after this season ends are mount skins. Good luck!
---
Not quite the same when they start assaulting the races of tyria for food, just the magic artifacts they've collected.
---
Zhaitan kill count is quite apparent when you see the races of tyria show up as risen everywhere, not just the orrians.
---
&gt;Whenever I feel like playing a more mmoRPG-y MMO, I switch to WoW or DAoC private servers. Especially the original DAoC leveling system is something I enjoy a lot. Good, old-fashioned grinding, slow attacks, downtime, actual, real buffs and debuffs, not that barely balanceable, PvP-bas

I know your pain, i finished my masteries 2 weeks ago and it was a long journey. But unless you were there when the masteries appeared you miss a lot of them.

If you are really serious about your winterberries, consortium harvesting sickly with Glyph of Reaping. You'll get posts calling you the bane of Charranity for not killing mobs in no time!

Is dulfy no longer active?
---
What happened to dulfy
---
She also covered SWTOR, ESO, Fallout 76, BDO and Destiny 2, so I don't think that she decided to not keep doing it for GW2. 
---
She just suddenly disappeared after April 30th 2019.
---
The frost griffons aren’t shown because they always swoop down when you think you’re finally safe.
---
If only vertical progression part was less grindy...
---
those who directly work together do use all tech, but its been a relatively short while since that started happening. need a bigger time jump to justify everything being basically integrated into everyone's culture and tech
---
Yes, I've done this many many times, but it doesn't change the fact that it will take ages to fill up a squad.
---
Also, the difference between a 200 Li and 800 Li plauer isn't that major to justify an 'entry barrier' that high. 
---
On another note, can you not use Caps in a forum? Makes a discussion more civilised.
---
Please tell me how any gnu licensed software spies on me.
---
You are doing God's work! Great work!
---
I'm sooo happy, it was exactly what I want! &lt;3
---
The undefined error is usually because the email is already registered (whether for gw2 or gw1). You mentioned in a previous reply that you used the auto generated password, but didn't clarify about the email, so just want to point that out specifically. If you use gmail you can use existingemail+newthing@gmail.com and all mail will go to existingemail@gmail.com but it's considered a unique email for gw2's purposes. Or just get a new email address period. 
---
If you've tried a new email address then the next thing I would do is open a support ticket (can do this anonymously) at https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
---
&gt;Please tell me how any gnu licensed software spies on me.
---
Because you only use these now everywhere right ?
---
Bloodstone fen ftw m8 sorry
---
It is for the same reason that Iron Man did not make armor for everyone in Avengers. Everyone has to look unique including their technology, even though it would be convenient.
---
Yeah, I like to test out new builds while grabbing some berries since it's a good spread of mobs that aren't terribly difficult unless you get a train pulled onto you.
---
That should be normal, as previous builds was with some shader cache included.
---
I'll begin with your Primal Spirit Jackal Skin preview. Nowhere did you walk the mount onto Dirt/Grass/Snow/Water or other that kicks up partial effects of Dust, Leaf, or other; these types of terrain will register mounts leaving foot prints and 2000 gem skins using special foot effects. Also nowhere did you use the mount with Ability 1 (the Jackal teleport function) and Engage Skill. Every mount is different like Griffon is with so many abilitys, try to go through every function of the mount with a 2k Skin. For flavor people do enjoy previews of the dye channels (I know you did that). But it shouldn't matter to you how many other people made a video on the skin, if you're going to do in-game previews do everything you can.
---
Now about the Distant Lands Mount Select Licence, I wouldn't force you into buying the whole damn thing!- So what you did with simple click able pictures with names is pretty great, I'd only say keep working on your visual improvement to the web page, text, icons, images. Also I think if you need more help on the back end of finding information quickly and working effectively you should talk to the people who work on the GuildWars2 Wiki, I think they would have more knowledge (than someone like me) about how to make a search bar work better.
---
For your Achievement Guides, you need to work on a Index and Contents within that set of Achievements for Living World and other, where the links within the Contents will auto scroll the page down to the Guide for X collection or achievement. That's one of the small functions Dulfy has. What you do that's new to me is adding the image of Story/NPC Chat Dialogue, keep doing that! **^(Thumbs up)** It really helps with specific context.
---
Honestly you don't have to tread on a long History of Wiki and Dulfy Guides, I would only recommend treading back to War Eternal and doing a Skyscale Guide, which will challenge you and be a huge help for compacting a lot of visuals and information. Using Reddit or the Wiki feels like a jumbled mess, exactly like the achievement is to do lol. It would be really nice to point someone to a single page that has everything about how to get Skyscale, it would also help a experienced player like me help someone else with the difficult parts of the collection. Or a Squad doing a Skyscale run. I feel like I'm begging but that would be really nice to have.
---
The last thing I'll recommend is try not to be a one-man-band, this kind of task you want to do is difficult to do alone. I've had many of my guild members think that Dulfy is selfish for not crediting players that helped her. I personally think that's stupid. Anyway, it's up to you too credit and source your information if that is important for you to do.
---
\----- I hope this helped you and Good Luck! - Tearthy Flame. &lt;3
---
That can't be the problem. I have tries using an email address which I created a month ago specifically for netflix and I am getting the same error :(
---
Never participated in secret toymaker but I always enjoyed these threads around wintersday!
---
Never mind, it somehow fixed itself just a moment ago. Thank you for the help !
---
EDIT : Turns out I had a copy of the game that I  purchased 5 years ago, the error meant that the e-mail must have already been in use
---
&gt; the uselessness of all HoT and LS3 masteries aside from gliding
---
Hopefully now that HoT is included they will add more of these to future maps.  Dragonfall showed how much old masteries can contribute to a new map without being required.
---
You don't need to, most people have shit gear already
---
They all just wanted to get early lunch.
---
Looks good, I'll keep an eye out for your website. Don't forget to post a link to the site when a major game update hits!
---
The mastery system is something for a veteran player to look forward to completing in the long term. Right now there is a lot of ways of getting mastery points in Hot, way more than when the expansion actually released. 
---
So I can agree when you say there is stuff is plain, but at the same time, there is always people that are going to like some parts and will not like others. What is fun for the player is a highly subjective matter. I didn't mind doing the stuff for the masteries for example. I did it all and I'm actually looking at spare points. For me, it was pretty much something to look for and made me replay the maps and plan ahead because of that.
---
The bouncy chests have 2 buffers.  20 when in a map, and 4 when loading into another map.  When these buffers are exceeded, the chests are autolooted into your character's inventory.
---
Edit: Easiest way to test this, get 4 bouncy chests, take a character to Caledon Forest that hasn't map completed, and do all the hearts (without opening any of them).  The last 3 hearts will autoloot the gold &amp; karma once you finish the heart.  When you change maps most of the rest will autoloot on map change (or if you go to character select and come out of it)
---
I was not aware I was the only Mad Queen :o
---
Don't forget that the maps for LS3 have more very easy HoT mastery points than are needed for the masteries that LS3 needs itself.  I skipped many of the adventures and still maxed them and then some just by doing those, which are almost all "find the point and attune to it".
---
They want a bit more tham "breakfast". That while "mindless forces of nature just seeking to consume and balance magic" is how the first few chapters of thr PS depicts them but honestly once Chapter 7 hits and we get into Orr that gets debunked.
---
The Elder Dragons are each shown to be intelligent with their own individual goals, which all require consuming a ton of magic. And all goals end up being "killing/enslaving the races to achieve" type goals.
---
And with S4's finale, we're showcased that consuming different types of magic, such as the ley lines eithout filters, results in slow insanity even for Elder Dragons.
---
Weaver has far more aoe damage and cleave than DH, to compare the two is laughable at best. DH isn't denying anything from anyone and like you say weaver brings much more hard and soft cc while all dh has is stab and some vuln. So yeah they don't really fill the same role at all i'm glad you agree.
---
It is 20 in map, 4 when loading into other maps.
---
If you update and atleast be on top of it. I will start recommending it to new players and players who ask some basic guides, :) will recommend your site to new players... And don't be dulfy, if you enjoy doing it. Do it :)
---
Festivals last 3 weeks. It won't begin October 1st, never has, never will.
---
October 15th to November 5th is when Halloween event will run based on past years.
---
Only the first one iirc.
---
shadows are literaly most taxing shit you can turn on :D
---
Logitech G604. Just released. Looks to be a very good mouse. I will replace my G700 with it.
---
Took 0 effort on my part, just went by memory lol
---
Wair, Dulfy site isnt around anymore?
---
I'm specializing as Reaper on my Necro - I have the first skills ([screenshot](https://p153.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/yAu4XZNv/Image+2019-09-29+at+2.40.47+PM.png)), but still cannot use greatswords. Do I have to max this spec out before I can actually use them even though the first skill ("Greatsword Proficiency") was obtained?
---
Ouch, on that shade change on necro, unless they give a way for necro to remove a shade or make the shade 0 cool down but remove the first shade and replace it with your new casted shade (4th shade) if not. The shade just stays there. You lose your main kit specially how easy it is to dodge the shade, even on PVE monsters easily avoid it. So basically you're a sitting duck once you fck up your shade. And idk why they are buffing that trait that all the bots use. The one where you get tankier and farm with your minions. No idea why the nerf on necro is this hard when their dps isn't even on top 3 or 5. Mostly necro is a utility. The only buff I found on necro is the 3 target into 5 target, but that's only for WVW when you zerg fight since shade placement is abit easy on zerg fight. But other than that. Necro got a full on nerf hard.
---
yes. it's that simple.  
---
that has nothing to do with the original problem.
---
I think there is change of setting.
---
In the beginning they are like you said, intelligent villains to be put down. Then Anet brought up the "natural balance" setting but I don't see it work too well.
---
I said it brings more aoe damage and cleave than DH which it does, its not even comparable. This isn't even mentioning how reliant burn DH is on the enemy not having any cleanse which even before antitoxin runes this was the case. All its ever been is a gimmick and once whoever you're fighting figures it out you're useless and might as well be on something else. You of all people shouldn't be calling others terrible, if skill was relevant to the conversation at all then you wouldn't have any legs to stand on.
---
the original subject was never about how long it took to fill up a squad.  
---
the original subject was about accessibility.  
---
open your own lfg = easy accessibility.
---
The Elder Dragons are made to be villains, it was dumb to set the "you can't kill or the world will explode, need replacement".
---
Actually to greenlight it they just have to make a forum post saying "yeah it's okay, we'll never ban for it. Cheers!"
---
Ouch! Do you have any videos to compare it to or...? No way to know if you play well or if your opinion is worthless. 
---
        
---
It's alright to suck at playing something, you'll get better over time =D keep practicing champ!
---
The balance thing had been around from the beginning. The only thing added was that their deaths harm Tyria which was foreshadowed back in S2, and that they're tormented by conflicting magic within them while Aurene (currently) isn't.
---
&gt; ban posts and accounts, like myself **for nothing**.
---
Not sure about that one.
---
That or the trolls that just run up to the bushes while you’re clearing the area of enemies and/or in downed state.
---
Have a great trip to Cyrodiil o/
---
That is not the tunnel vision I am talking about. There are way too many who are only considering the one trait line or sometimes even just the impact of a single trait without bothering to consider the impact of how it combines with other aspects of a class.
---
&gt; It almost always feels like the players care a lot more about balance than the balance team does
---
If by "care a lot more about balance" you mean "care a lot about their favorite class being the best without regards for anything else". There are people who care about balance but there is more of the latter.
---
Another problem with someone who is only familiar with one class is failure to account for the other side of a fight. You can end up with a skill that is good but still be bad for the game.
---
Nice, bookmarked. Looking forward to your future guides!
---
Living World story is not bundled.
---
Will do once I figure out how to add it. Thank you.
---
as far as I know, LWS is free only if you log in when the episode is launched. If you didn't, you must buy it with gems, so go with DLGame imo. 
---
sorry for the bad english.
---
Nobody knows details. No official announcement just some rumors about personal stuffs.
---
I actually did go to Cyrodil. What's wrong with Cyrodil? It's a nice game. Nothing wrong with a little game swapping now and then! 
---
I mean, yeah OP is an asshole but that doesn't mean playing ESO is bad! Now I'm sad.
---
She has stopped posting April 30th.
---
No problem. I thank for checking.
---
So how does it feel to make a new Reddit account just to act like a 12 year old?
---
My guess is he wants to be able to use gw2hook so he can remove the fog.
---
Thank you I hope i will not disappoint you.
---
But.....what about speed
---
Thank you for support!
---
The DLGamer version is exactly the same as the Standard version on the GW2 shop.
---
The Ultimate version with the discounted gems is the only thing exclusive to the GW2 shop.
---
This is about you not me but if I was a bad player i'm pretty sure no guild would have taken me in least of all KEK. Its also entirely irrelevant to the conversation like I said you wouldn't have any legs to stand on if was. Just take the out i'm giving you and get back to trying to convince me that dh is actually somehow comparable to weavers aoe and cleave unless you can't.
---
for real, in their forums i was completely respectful, giving tips on how to improve on wvw and pvp, or to fix that stupid warclaw, never insulted nobody, but lately a few new comers started to ask questions so i sat down and told them what i saw, as someone who played for 5 years already, no insults, or blaming devs or nothing like that, just told them, pvp and wvw are neglected, pve content is very dull and short for the amount of time you have to wait for it, and balance is not in a good spot, if you look for pvp go to another place... bum banned.
---
3 dead on close,war looks at ele with 1000 hp and runs away. seems like pvp i know.
---
There’s a difference between having ads and having poorly made background processes tho...  Ads are fine, we’re all cool with people gettin paid.  Background processes just make your site run poorly.
---
Please, be better than dulfy. She ran a good website sure, but she wasn't a good healer (I used to raid with her In SWTOR)

I will have to disappoint you. I am a clicker...

This game's vertical progression is nothing compared to the more mainstream MMOs.
---
dragonfall
---
If you wanna do get good results with farming you should join farming discords, both EU and NA has one
---
is there a link to the NA one?
---
I dunno... this is ofc personal but i managed 2k hours in gw2 (which is still really a lot imo) until i got really bored. Meanwhile i'm approaching 4k hours on ff14 without once getting bored due to the gear goalpost moving forward all the time.
---
However i do admit its nice feeling when you come back to gw2 after a year and your hard earned ascended stuff is still just as powerful as they were when you left.
---
It's a mixture. There's both group content (weekly raids, daily fractals (fractals kinda replaced dungeons, which are deprecated nowadays)) and open world stuff (world bosses, meta event chains, farms). Of course it partially depends on your end game goals which is more attractive, but both are definitely worth it in some way.
---
Haha, Thanks! Based on the feedback, I believe we have enough devs for this :D
---
Impossible with an Engineer of course but.
---
I have it maxed out and generally get 30-120fps depending on where I am. 17770k and GTX 1070. What DX912pxy did for me was give me stable fps even in WvW.
---
What's wrong with the comments?
---
I assume the popularity on the map drastically decreased, comparing fps with same settings when 10people are near you or when 50+ can give up to double the fps.
---
That's the point!
---
Then idk dude. If this is enough dissuade you, maybe MMOs just aren't for you. 
---
Do you know of any popular MMOs with less vertical progression than this one? I can't.
---
Its something ive never understood,why not just reskin the stuff they have. Like maybe not magumma jungle adrenal mushrooms but some reskin that matches the area and fits but uses the same mastery and mechanic. Similar to how in LS3 bitterfrost frontier where there are still thermal tubes (with an ice aesthetic) and bouncing mushrooms (also with a frozen north aesthetic) if they could just keep plopping those around it would still make sense and be immersive to have those masteries in new maps. Rather than jungle mushrooms its some desert mushroom or something for example.
---
One thing they should do is have WvW seasons like for PvP once the alliance systems out.
---
I just noticed my camera stutter even more when I turn it around, it's like my game is begging for help...
---
Yeah, I save them from terroists invading their streets and throwing bombs to civilians from the roofs
---
Awesome! That makes me so happy to hear. Keep at it! Studying web development is one of the best decision I ever made!
---
Dulfy had like 4-5 MMOs she was updating.
---
153% isn't that high, so you don't need insane amounts of luck to increase your luck. Reaching cap (300) isn't that easy if you don't specifically farm for it, or play quite much, but the difference between, say, 250 and 300 isn't so high, so maybe stop somewhere and then just passively increase it by playing normally. 
---
Best farm is salvaging ectos, I'd say. Their price is varying quite a bit, so (if you want to take that route) buy them when they're cheaper. Another good way is Lunar New Year, although this festival will only return next year. The LNY envelopes contain tons of luck. If you got a bunch of side accounts, you can even farm money by buying the envelopes that are limited to 16 a day per account. You can buy them and send them to your main account, open them there and you get tons of luck + money (especially if you're really boosting your magic find while opening. You can easily get to 600+ with boosters and stuff).
---
&gt; And actually bring my personal skill into play by combining these things in efficient and exciting ways others may not even have thought of.
---
Like what?
---
i like it alot more then the wiki version where its just an array of the achivments
---
the screens and explanation about what to do help alot , for example the "heads up" achivment , wiki has same info as ingame , nothing more , but you have a screen where to be and when it will happen
---
thats also the reason why dulfy was popular even with the wiki beeing there, videos and screens help alot
---
edit: also maybe try to add the option to comment with your disqus/facebook/wahtever account
---
I don't get get Anet doesn't just bundle PoF with Season passes for S2/S3/S4. 
---
I suspect that it's because they can be purchased for free with gold from the gemstore but I still think they should offer a "complete" edition.
---

You can only get 300% Magic Find from Luck. Press H. Go to Achivements. In the lower right hand corner is a list of your XP% Karma% and Magic Find%. If you are at 300% Magic Find from Luck, then there is no need to comsume Luck.
---
Want more Luck? The activities from the holiday Lunar New Year's in late Jan. to early Feb. give ton of Luck. Do not want to wait for that? Use a salvage kit on a Glob of Ectoplasm. You just buy them from the Trading Post or use a salvage kit on any weapon or armor of Rare (yellow) quality that is level 68 to 80 (max). Any META (big mapwide event) on Heart of Thorns, Living Story Season 4 maps, or Bounties in Path of Fire gives several Rare quality gear.
---
Didn't read all, but I went into edge of the mist like 1 month ago, and there were a lot of players, most of them diamond rank etc..., pretty sure it's still a good farm for ranks so still played.  
---
And even tho I could say wait for alliances, they could drop the best patch ever for WvW, not enough people would come back and I still think it is a waste of time. We"ll see
---
Good luck with this adventure, also be prepared for server costs and a big time investment :).
---
Thank you :)
---
Is that what you call clean victory?
---
I would love to see some written crafting guides. Videos are nice, but I don't always have the luxury of being able to sit and watch/listen to a video. Written means I can just glance over and see it quickly.
---
Looks great so far though. Looking forward to seeing what you do with it.
---
Gold is cool too

To be honest, Gw2 wasn't really build to support a Hardcore scene. And the entry requirements for a new player are not reachable. It doesn't help that the Raid community is Toxic and mostly unwilling to actually try to get more new players.
---
Also I still think Raid selling shouldn't be a thing. It's like an annoying Ad when you are just looking for a Squad to join. The Prices are ridiculously high, and by no means justified. 
---
Tbh, I'm glad most players who call themselves 'hardcore' leave the game, because they contribute nothing and are only complaining like spoiled kids.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; *extension* of our power [...] near *and* far [...] from *both* ourselves *and* our shades
---
while she doesn't say it straight up it is still *very* heavily implied.
---
What do you farm dragonite for? I have way too much of it.
---
OMG very nice work bro, salved and recomended. o/
---
I did mention that, yes. What's your point exactly? Those games will die eventually as well.
---
Emergency patch notes: changed ‘and’ to ‘or’.
---
Im adding this site to favorites , hopefully will see more of ur work . Tx for effort !
---
Personaly id go trough all the story of at least PoF and Lws4, itll really make your experience in Icebrood story better. When it comes to mounts, as long as you got the standart 3, youll be fine. But you should def get all the mounts eventualy. Overall tho, if you dont care for story, youre fine, im just story fanatic and love it too much lol.
---
Part of me wishes that this was all just done through the GW2 wiki. The GW1 wiki was incredibly thorough about everything, and the GW2 wiki tends to be lackluster in comparison.  
---
In reality, though, the time it takes to make guides like this does warrant a separate website so that the content creator can get some form of compensation (be it through ad revenue or patreon).
---
&gt; However i do admit its nice feeling when you come back to gw2 after a year and your hard earned ascended stuff is still just as powerful as they were when you left.
---
Eh GW2 had those FF14 similarities at one point. I quit the game before because I had every class in full Exotics and then they released Ascended and it felt bad to lose what I thought would forever be BIS gear.
---
I would rather this energy be focused on the wiki too, but in reality the time these guides and stuff take to make warrants some measly form of compensation/recognition--you don't get any ad revenue from adding to the wiki.
---
1. They only dodge rolled once after the Warrior entered the shot
---
2. They have the trait [Evasive Arcana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evasive_Arcana) which caused that flame burst when they dodged. They were likely trying to hit the Warrior with that flame burst. 
---
3. Actually watch the video next time.
---
Full zerker daredevil clears winterberry runs faster than any of my other toons so I'd reccomend that if you have the option. Few vaults and bounding dodge does the trick
---
&gt; Tbh, I'm glad most players who call themselves 'hardcore' leave the game, **because they contribute nothing and are only complaining like spoiled kids.**
---
Good luck finding a single up to date guide on anything at all once everyone who played more than 10 hours a month has quit the game. I'm sure that's also going to positively contribute to revenue reports and make it easier for new people to get into the game, somehow.
---
The problem there is that bandwagoning will just get worse unless alliances are locked from transferring each time they are reset. If transfers are allowed, you'll just see the BG version of an alliance pop up in the new system as well.
---
As other person commented I think is because there's barely people on X map, good example would be yesterday on Domain of Kourna, I got 4 warns of very few players in less than 15 mins. To be honest it was nice because of the buff, but it kinda made me sad that Kourna has now barely players, and like that probably many more maps from LWS4 and maybe some more like LWS3 (might be just me that I run into a bad hour)
---
Yes, there are a few people who actually do something constructive. But most of these 'hardcore' players do more harm then good.
---
Also, I'm talking specifically about Raid players, but you interpreted it on the whole playerbase.
---
Existing guides don't disappear because people leave. Dulfy's guides are still all up, even though she currently isn't able to play. Other people will step in when those people leave, it's normal.
---
Map design it is close to a design concept that cannot be protected. Even in the west.  The skill art indeed is more clear cut and definitely has a case. But too much effort for just a skill icon.
---
Not according to this source you linked: https://www.ascii-code.com/
---
ő =/= ô or õ
---
Neither is Amnoon but it still has a bank, merchant, and TP (plus everything else mention inside the Lily of the Elon)
---
Blood Legion aren't keen on trading with other races, I imagine.
---
24 episodes and 30 story instances i'd consider that a few. At the moment we have \~5 story instances per episode. Season 4 has 6 episodes and around 30 story instances, which is a lot more in comparison.
---
The biggest problem is places like Lion's Arch that was destroyed, Anet would have to remake those kind of stories in instances aswell this time around. Making it a lot more work then just flipping a switch to turn it back on.
---
Yes people would give dulfy alot of the info they needed to update that site, and she very rarely would give the people credit for it, anyone visiting that site back in the day would think they did it all themselves, when that just wasnt the case, im sure OP will get more than enough people helping out, they should consider a guild with like minded people who can help OP update there site when new content comes out.
---
Thief should be medium tier, and mesmer should be lowest tier.
---
That's the only change that can be justified.
---
Love them free magica and Karna. But that was ages before reapers drain all the magic from the spiders.
---
I wouldn't count Lily of the Elon. And I don't think you could compare Amnoon to the Blood Keep. Amnoon is an actual city and serves as a central hub to players in Path of Fire. No other outpost, city or town has any services beyond the basic ones that even the Blood Keep has, in Path of Fire.
---
And not to mention, it's the Blood KEEP. It's not really a city. It's a barracks and boot camp for Blood Legion Charr. 
---
From a more technical point of view, the Blood Keep is just an outpost in another long list of living world towns in living world maps. While they're meant for longevity and replayability, (depends on what you also consider replayable), no content on those maps is meant to diminish the importance of the 5 main cities in Tyria.
---
Not even Amnoon replaces a fully stocked city. Amnoon may have a TP, which is also thematically appropriate due to Amnoon being a trade hub in Elona, it doesn't have all of the enmities that LA or the Grove has.
---
more like to lazy to sift thru teapots vods to find it.
---
It's not the same as Amnoon, Ebonhawke or even Skrittsburg.
---
Blood are militaristic, isolationists, and distrustful.  
---
Unlike Iron legion, they did not set offices for tribunes of the other legions.   The only reason Bangar invited the other legions was to poach their impressionable and easily manipulable young.  
---
They would not have crafting stations open to the public, since they are mostly military. So they won't want to encourage their young to become 'creative'. They can have specialized warbands to be trained for making weapons.
---
They would not want BL services, since they are related to Evon, who is Ash, and ash are spies, and they do not trust ash.   
---
They won't want their troops to waste time trying to 'look pretty'. So no aesthetician.  
---
And no need for merchants when everyone is in the ranks. They all get provisions assigned.  Tourists can set their shops outside the keep and try their look in the wilderness.
---
That's not exordium.
---
Oof
---
Yeah but thief has massive kiting potential and mobility. Mesmer is just a glorified mirror. The moment you notice their patterns, well they fucked. 
---
So to compensate. Thief has low health and Mesmer has medium.
---
Guys I am literally earning nothing. I just do it as hobby and I am enjoying it. So for now i dont have to think if that game will die and my profit with it :).
---
Oh, so you do not have any videos to show that your opinion is relevant? That's a pity =D
---
Plenty of videos on my channel of burn dh outperforming weavers. If that's not enough for you, tough luck. There is a video guide on how to build and play burn dh though, chances are you were doing it wrong man
---
That it is sweet. Thank you.
---
Hahahaawwwwww I'm sad now.
---
Can be problem i am not scared of Bats. They are cute sky puppies.
---
Thank you I have already invested a lot.
---
Thank you for your support!
---
Thank you for feedback :).
---
He can leave and rejoin with another rank (that you create)
---
Also ANet won't do anything if you ask them.
---
I use schema for my web. Unfortunately I am kind of lost in wiki editing.
---
You are welcome :).
---
I will think about it and most probably I will add it too. Thank you for your feedback.
---
Thank you for your nice words.
---
Thank you i really want to continue. I have already payed for webhosting :D
---
If we get a story content update before the end of the year I'll eat my gym socks. I REALLY don't see this happening, unless Arenanet somehow kicked themselves into gear.
---
Ah okay Thankyou so much for explaining!!
---
These people don't have the ability to add stuff to the gemstore.
---
Yeah I totally get what you mean about not wanting to wander if your travel is already taking ages - and I agree with you on that (I'm currently playing classic wow, and even a slight detour in order to gather a herb comes with some pain hahaha).
---
At the same time though, I don't think I've ever been so immersed as I have in classic wow. Travelling is a pain in the ass, but it means that I actually run past everything in the world, I hear all the sounds, I feel fear from high level mobs, gathering for a dungeon feels like you're actually preparing for something big.
---
Each to their own though! And I'm jealous that the system GW2 went with suits you better - GW2 is the most beautiful MMO I've played, I just don't find it very engaging anymore.
---
I suppose that ascended gear and agony resistance are a form of vertical progression, but not having more than one set of ascended is more a choice and still not that grindy.  Buckling down for a legendary weapon is only a couple weeks, a set of ascended shouldn't take more than a week to craft to be honest... and the stats can be easily changed.
---
Thankyou for explaining kind sir!!
---
Not heavily enough to clash with the new design, because Scourges can still produce their effects *both* from themselves *and* their shades.  
---
That 'and' may not be an inclusive or, but it doesn't have to be, because 'and' alone doesn't necessarily imply simultaneity.
---
I think they said on the presentation of the icebrood saga they will use the old masteries in the new maps.
---
Pretty weak point and kind of irrelevant.
---
Dulfy can't know if she's going to like any of those mystery games or even have *time* for them. Are you suggesting she should stick with a money source that has unknown expiration date, completely independent of anything she does, in hopes of another game replacing it instead of focusing a more stable job that probably has better hours and provides her more free time and lord knows what other benefits?
---
I've played this game 3k hours over it's first few years of life and was even part of shaping the early dungeon grinding meta. There was never a single mention of higher tier gear being intended to be in the game, if they stated that multiple years down the road it's as good as false.
---
Kinda sad that you resorted to personal attacks so fast:
---
&gt; you really like being anal
---
&gt; spew total bull shit
---
 especially considering you claim I "misinterpret" things when you misinterpreted my comment to begin with, starting to talk about "needing" ascended gear when I never said you did.
---
&gt; Exotic is still, for the majority of the game, BiS.
---
This is objectively false. BiS is full Ascended/Legendary gear starting at max level. The only moment Exotic is BiS is between the first level you can equip exotics and max level which is certainly not the "majority of the game"
---
Lots of objectives, with 3 commanders goin in circle it's free rank farm.
---
Eh, not really to me honestly. She's really under no obligation to say anything. Maybe she just doesn't want to till she's certain about various things? Might also just be due to personal life events that she just really doesn't want to share.
---
this but fire sigil over speed since unhindered gives enough swiftness and you get incidental sources from nearby players..could also be further improved with having 2 shortbows and swapping them on cooldown
---
flamethrower engi is fine for tagging but nowhere close to thief or mesmer..yea greatsword mirage is very good at it too! same stuff as thief with stamina sigil dodge and autoattack spam
---
[Tempest is far better for beginners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esD3qMYRWf8&amp;list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv&amp;index=4&amp;t=1077s)  Weaver requires a much more complex, robust and fluid understanding of elemental attunements, kiting/strafing and active defense (all the things you can do to make enemies lives difficult).
---
What name do we praise now? Praise Yara?
---
I dunno, when I imagined "Horizontal" progression, I imagined like having to gear up and progress into different game types independently. Like, if you had the Agony system from fractals then you needed some different kind of Agony for Raids and then strike missions.
---
With how it goes, GW2 feels more like it has Vertical progression with all the mounts we get because they completely change how you play the game forever with little to no sense of achievement in reaching that progress or process is trivialized.
---
I would be all for "skill based" progression, but the game modes that reward that, WVW, PVP, Raids, and Fractals, don't get nearly as much support compared to living story.
---
I fully agree your situation was handled poorly. 
---
That said, I've never seen any racist jokes from any of the bcrats or admins. I'm unsure where this accusation is coming from. Same with the power abuse allegations.
---
Be a thief then?
---
I’m very interested in Revenant, but don’t really hear that it’s good in PvP. Is there any viable spec for it? I was thinking in Guardian too, since I like classes that can do everything. I like to be support too. What are your thoughts between these two? I only hear good things about Guardian and 1 good about Revenant and 9 bad. Any feedback is much appreciated!
---
PvP game loop for weavers is boring and predictable. There are strong meta bunker builds for weaver in sPvP atm.
---
That's because not every spec is meant to be played with every stat. Mirage is not meant to be a power spec just like Scourge isn't either.
---
alts
---
No quite the other way around. In WvW it is worse then ever and lately it is even spilling over to PvE.
---
Beeeeeee Utiful!  Thanks so much...count on me, I'll be there!  &lt;3
---
But that is my point, Power Mirage is under powered. You shouldn't have to re roll because a class underperforms. It should be brought up on par.
---
Lets not mix up mounts with the mastery system.
---
The mastery system as a whole is a joke. Its no progression what so ever. Was cool at Hot because you had a lot to choose from, they started out giving crappy efects that grew overtime and you could notice the progression, not only because it actually required some effort but you could not unlock everything at once so getting that one extra bit of progress felt meaningful.
---
But the community complained and now you get masteries for free. They're still nice in functionality, but in acquisition they're shallow and really crappy. 30m of grind every 4 months .. only the Roller Beatle and Skyscale felt good but it was because of the collections and not necessarily the masteries themselves, as those were pretty easy to acquire as well.
---
When in PoF it took you less than an hour to unlock the upgraded movements in all the mounts (increased leap for raptor, increase hovering for skimmer, etc), you knew they had given up on actually forcing the player to go through some grind .. thats not progression .. its understandable they cannot release a big number of masteries every episode, but they had a chance at PoF to make it better but they did not.
---
Not only that, you get so many masteries from the xpac, that throughout LS4 I did not have to unlock any of the masteries of the map, as I always had 15+ mastery points leftover from previous content.
---
Its a mess and I hope they look it up for LS5 ..
---
This looks great! Excited to see you progress. If I could ever help feel free to ask!
---
Example?
---
awesome!  thanks!
---
I don't know what are you doing with your ele. I'm a main Tempest and it's really hard to kill me, I barely die and I often solo multiple elites or champions for fun, always in glass cannon gear.  
---
Learning to use proper water blast combos is critical on ele, though.
---
I'm quite new and don't understand why everyone keeps saying copper fed salvageomatic. What does it offer except for the convenience of not having to buy salvage kits from vendors?
---
You're an idiot if you think that way. But, sure.
---
You seem to lack basic understanding of what "identity" means. It's not about bringing one specific thing up to par with a different class. It's about each spec being a specific roll. 
---
You don't go into a raid with a shield expecting to pull off high DPS numbers. You use a shield to tank. 
---
By your logic, let's buff scepter to be on par with power DPS because FUCK everyone else, I want to play my own shitty build rather than something remotely even viable.
---
Wow personally attacks instead of debate.  
---
Great job. Can't wait for GW2 to die.
---
Try to delete the gw2 bin64 folder, it "should" redownload and reinstall it, if not just use -repair command line argument. That folder is mostly for the web-engine that it's used for the TP (Coherent).
---
again, chronomancer &amp; mirage are not classes. they are elite specs, shit you can switch out on the fly.
---
Show me power mirage dps at the golem.
---
Sorry there, buttercup, if you're too sensitive. I can't help you there.
---
Nice of you to just straight up attack the game for your own shortcomings. Don't want it to be personal, don't be stupid in the first place.
---
Be objective and actually come up with a good argument other than some shit pulled straight out of the trash.
---
&gt; Wow personally attacks instead of debate.
---
&gt; Great job. Can't wait for GW2 to die.
---
If you really wanted to debate, you could actually debate rather than just say shit like "can't wait for GW2 to die". You're such a child.
---
You can't make all classes do the same thing. By that logic you want power druid to be as strong as condi soulbeast.
---
I feel like hp is fine as is, what i would like to see is the expansion of the barrier system, give it to more classes, rework the scourge to give it something else. 
---
Have classes with a lower base recoeve a multiplier based on the amount of barrier recieved (so say ele gets 1.15x). Potentially have the multiplier be based on the total hp pool, so if you are playing a squishy spec it ramps up but goes down as you become more of a tank (down to say .85 for full tank)
---
The fact remains that "Power mirage" is a known build and exists within the game. (although more so historic for PvP)
---
It not being viable is a problem. Saying "just go chrono" which feels and plays differently is not the answer.
---
I think you misunderstand what I said?  
---
You: Your team doesn't deserve low DPS.  
---
Me: A-net should buff it so it isn't low DPS.  
---
You: Show me.  
---
Me:????????? wat?
---
[Power herald](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Shiro) is still a strong build with a lot of damage and utility. [Trama Dex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-EIJdUWlS_U1ImsNizVPA) actually has some recent videos of his Herald gameplay (many games with a herald on the other team too). I will say that it's a much higher skill option than a lot of other builds so if you're looking for something easy to play you may want to pick something else but it can perform really well in sPvP. If you are looking for a support build though, that's much more of a firebrand thing and you could go [mantra bunker](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Mantra_Bunker)
---
Power Mirage is something that already exists within the game in PvP and Open world. It was very popular season 9ish in PvP.   
---
Asking for it to have a viable option in raids and fracs isn't a stretch.
---
As a main Guardian as well, I can relate to all those problems. specially as a DH main, people think just because of the blocks, we have high sustain but what they don't see (or rather read) Aegis only blocks next incoming attack and that for current meta means absolutely nothing due multihitting skills (warr GS2, thief dagger storm, ranger LB2, mesmer GS1 or Staff 2...) even the less when now there are traits/skills that makes attacks unblockable (which for my F3 is horrible)
---
Imo, I would rather say, buff by 2k lower pool and maybe 1k mid pool so hp classes to be like:
---
Low pool: 13,6k
---
Mid pool: 16,4k
---
High pool: 19,2k
---
Condi Mirage excels because the traits, utility skills, and weapon skills that Mirage adds to the class mostly focus on condi. It's clearly designed as a condi spec. But additionally, yes you're right, the fact that clones are designed to deal no power damage but still apply conditions is a feature of the Mesmer class at its core and Mirage leverages that to great effect.
---
I like to imagine that in lore, the Chrono elite spec mentor would give up trying to keep up with his class changes and respec to Mirage.
---
Ele can still be super tanky and at least on the golem it's still top dps… so... no?
---
Yeah, all those [damage](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) nerfs really destroyed Ele dps.
---
Ele has consistently always been at the top. If anything they need even more nerfs to bring them in line with other DPS specs. If ele gained more HP they would need quite a big dps nerf to compensate for the HP gain.
---
you can say the same for the build "healer soulbeast". people always say "just go druid" but clearly anet meant for healer soulbeast to be a thing, why would they introduce supportive type pets otherwise? healer soulbeast not being viable is a problem
---
because he said so.
---
1. condi reaper also existed. It used to be much stronger than power reaper in spite of reaper always being designed as a power spec.
---
2. There are a lot of spec-stat combos that are great in PvP and trash in PvP. Both game modes are very different. Spellbreaker is almost entirely useless in raids and yet is very strong PvP (and WvW) . Asking for a spec to be strong in one because it is or was in the other is absurd.
---
&gt; such as the ley lines eithout filters
---
I always thought that ley lines were the least contaminated if not the purest form of magic. Kralkatorrik became insane because he ate other ED magic (which started eons ago).
---
&gt; expansion of the barrier system
---
Not just barrier, keep expanding buffs in general. It opens up more playstyles and less restrictions. There is a reason why support Chrono was the most dominant support in the game *for years*.
---
so does hammer warrior.
---
Its meta in pvp 🙄
---
Look into power chrono. Some specs are built to have a bit of bias in efficiency in certain areas.
---
