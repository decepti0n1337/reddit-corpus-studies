Doesn't matter. If you can't treat all customers equal it's better to not have such promotions.

---
I won't argue about LW amount of content because it's not the subject in this topic  
---
But 2-4 hours (good) free content every 3 month or more is not that much even if that's something i have tolerated until the recent disapointement and fail from anet decisions.
---
Because ep 2 will be on the same map based on what they talked about. Why would 1 map have 2 masteries?
---
&gt; and that game included a special menu where you could view their health bars
---

---
Yeah, that was also added 6 years after release. 4 years after Eye of the North was released.
---
&gt; we would like to see how the WvW meta adjusts before making additional changes.
---
I could meme on this statement with Soon™ or never but its just really sad when I expect them to never come back to this issue.
---
Guild wars isn't about vertical progression,to link things all together t but I do think they need to improve horizontal progression. The mastery system was a good a idea but failed to delivery for me, so perhaps http://strawpoll.me/3905472 improved mastery system with some of GW1s skill/build progression and maybe another system
---
&gt; I won't talk about the amount of content
---
&gt; 2 - 4 hours is not much
---
Think you started it :)
---
This is not the trailer
---
Yeah because i was enought polite to give my quick explanation and answers to you about the comment of" content drought " you have made :)
---
And then I said "If you don't like it, just leave" and here we are
---
No new legendary weapon? Daaaamn
---
yep
---
And it's because i really like this game for 7 years that i want it to improve again after this disapointed year :)
---
Well there still ain't no content drought
---
Yall got me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I tried them all, they're all taken.
---
I'd love this
---
You have to remember that Europe is even with the EU a dangerous labyrinth of different gambling/raffle laws. Personally I would not want to spend time checking 30 different sets of rulings just to make a raffle in Europe! What could've been done is a promotion, but even then there are afaik not really that many chains that come to mind that have subsidiaries in many European countries (not counting the super big ones)
---
They had other games regular templates, their previous games form of templates and even Arc Templates which could have been used as reference points for implementing something that would appeal to players.
---
Instead they went their own route as they usually do and implemented a convoluted system that is heavily monetized. The casual side of gamers didn’t care for templates and most likely would only buy a slot or two extra for a few characters if at all because the “extra” base templates are more than enough for them. The more hardcore players don’t benefit from the templates because they are far too limited in use and quantity and locked by a paywall PER CHARACTER. 
---
This leaves a small group satisfied with the templates, another group upset because the templates don’t truly function in a way that’s useful, and then a third group that’s indifferent either way and may or may not use them.
---
So the templates overall kind of miss the mark. 
---
They then decided to preview the templates and they had a month of concerns from players in the form of feedback. All of it wasn’t even acknowledged and templates released in the same exact state presented.
---
Problem is the templates literally started to break the game for a good chunk of players and cause other annoyances for another set of players.
---
Now the feedback really ramped up with a lot of it being voiced out of desperation and frustration. 
---
Anet did exactly as expected and shoved all template related threads into a single one - as some sort of damage control. They then said they are reading and listening and are discussing internally now that they have feedback... even though there was a month worth of feedback prior to that.
---
It’s now likely Anet is waiting to release episode 1 hoping that people will shut up and move on. It’s possible they may offer some slightly on “sale” bundles for template related stuff to appease the players. 
---
And in the end the issues and concerns of the players go to the wind and once again the game steps deeper into hyper-monetization.
---
We also died after taking the oath :)
---
It's a multinational, multimillion company. And they can't afford SHIPPING?
---
Yeah, no.
---
Alternating raid release/fractal release with each episode release btw
---
Likely because it's just a shot in an existing map, like some of the other shots in the trailer
---
I would say the cosmetics just aren't that great on FFXIV store? That's why I'd say they're very optional. You can get better looking items in/game for the most part. Most of them are also very cheap, like less than $3-5. 
---
I think the cosmetics are a bit different in GW2. Most of them look much better than the in game items, and they are generally a bit more expensive. For instance it's kind of a meme that legendary armor in GW2 just gets changed to be a cosmetic skin, while in FFXIV generally the hardest to get items look better than items you can buy.
---
Whoa! That's exactly what my 3 abyss black dicks look like when they are awake and roaming the fields!
---
It was at HoT release though. It was mesmer exclusive and was displayed in the lower icon bar next to empower allies, spotter and all that stuff.
---
I'm not in this picture and I don't like anything.
---
They're easier and cheaper. Not necessarily faster. Thats what I said. Unless you plan doing T4 fracs tomorrow, you don't really need full ascended armor and you're better off playing pvp/raids and grind it out. Crafting is too cost ineffective
---
What is the deal with Jormag and air? First the trailer presents air as the epitome of life in Tyria. Then Jormag eats Owl, an air spirit. Then Raven, another air spirit, decides to take Jormag on. What is really going on here?
---
I've been spending a bit of time thinking about what the Priory "Spirit Realms" are really all about. Could it be possible that the spirits are in a free-for-all to decide who gets control of a particular element? Kind of like the events of the latest raid:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The\_Key\_of\_Ahdashim](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Key_of_Ahdashim).
---
I don't know. Has anyone got any thoughts on this to share?
---
Fractals and Raids are the new Dungeons of Gw2.
---
When you activate the shrine it gives you swiftness for 10 seconds.
---
Do you not consider time to be a resource?  I'm genuinely trying to understand your point of view.  Easier to max out weekly shards for raids?  You need a full 150 shards for one piece, 400 shards for the chest.  Pvp is also terrifying for most players, let alone having them max out 2-6 reward tracks for a single piece.  If you just craft it you can play however you want to acquire the gold.  You need 500 crafting anyway for the pvp armor.
---
one of the things i've learned with anet is to never set your expectations too low, they will continue to surprise you.
---
And clicking the arrow inside the speech bubble in the bottom left also provides the same functionality
---
Spirit shards are worth more than a gold each.  If you think they're worthless, you have no idea what you're doing.
---
Seems like all codes have been redeemed. Oh well
---

---
*Everything* in running a business requires data.
---
LW2 sucks as a product because is really too small and adds no new maps to the F2P experience. It should be free.  
---
LW3/4 are great because of lot of new maps.
---
Pretty obvious that with dedicated pvp/wvw devs and pvp/wvw specific patches they don't give a flying fuck about PvE balance. There hasn't been a single "In PvE only" dedicated patch, ever.
---
y r u still on this subreddit if u havent played this game in the last 4yrs &gt;.&gt;
---
Did you deactivate tailor for something else before? If you have you have to reactivate it.
---
Honestly, I feel like it's a mess.
---
1. The claws are obscuring the lettering and the slashes.
---
2. The slashes make reading the words harder to read.
---
3. The slashes are making the background bleed?
---
4. I don't understand why the body is melting.
---
5. I think it's supposed to be a Warclaw?  Or a Charr?
---
6. There are some blue angles all over the large fangs near the base.  Not sure what that's about.
---
7. There are two spots of the mane, on the left and right, that look to be colored blue instead of gold.
---
8. The horns look awful.  
---
9. Not a fan of the gradients.  There are a for or five colors in this palette, with various shades and gradients on top of that.  It is doing too much for my tastes.
---
10. Some claws aren't attached to the hands and they just float over the logo.   
---
11. There are too many lines in the face.  I think it was done to give some detail or texture to the face but it just overly complicates the feature.  Maybe remove some of the green/yellow highlights on the face?  Maybe take some of the contour lines out of the face?  I feel like his face is a topographical map of some town.
---
Good start I s'pose.  I couldn't do it -- that's for sure.  But it just don't like it.
---
10man squads still fail them. Also cleartime is another issue. Maybe some players dont want to or cant spend hours in a raid so killing bosses fast allows them to clear more stuff.
---
Thanks!

I don't think hindering the class balance process because the super casuals can't/won't use WASD+Spacebar properly is a good idea. There's enough non-gameplay busywork for that in the game already
---
I very much doubt this change was for design reasons.

Agreed, but keep in mind that kills the ability for any new player to get that for quite a long time.

you can main guardian on literally every single raid boss..wtf are you on about? not only that, but in most cases it's the optimal pick too

That reminds me of the party mission from Nightfall. Towards the end I would grab one of the food or drink trays for silly photo ops during the wrap-up conversations.

I'm in it and don't like this picture.

There will be!  It's going to be locked behind abhorent RNG BS and daily gating, though.  You can buy it for the low, low price of 6-8000 gp on the BLC though!
---
You see it as punishment,  but I don't understand why. I see it as a way to guarantee things will not become junk because of farmers with too much time on their hands.
---
fourty-thousand achievement points is an incredible achievement, I agree. But who are you to dismiss someone's first world completion as "irrelevant" and "easy to achieve"? Are you tracking their playtime? Have you dictated that they are only allowed to work on map completion and only map completion while they play? Does your claim to a several hour world completion hold up to a new player?  
---
And people just want to show appreciation for something they have come to love. Art, in-game screens, whatever it may be. Expression for the love of the game doesn't always have to be in the form of 40k AP, complete and full legendary armor/weapons, full raid clears, etc.  Get that high horse shit outta here. The only reason this subreddit is in a state about "Shitting on the other" is because people like you are eager to alienate and dismiss the other as worthless. 
---
It's obvious your mind is set on the matter, so I'm not going to continue to argue. But hopefully this at least fuels the potential broader think-tank hidden in your mind than the anger-fueled train of thought you have going on now. 
---
TL:DR People go about things in different paces.  Be an adult and understand that people don't need to be the best of the best in order to express their appreciation for something they enjoy.
---
My only take on it being added to controlled territory is to remove gliding in owned territory while in combat. If we would get reduced fall damage in our controlled areas AND gliding in them, then one should be for 'in combat' and one for 'out of combat', this way both see use in a way that feels practical to the situation
---
&gt;cater to redditors
---
lmao. templates are complete garbage because of this. fuck redditors and fuck **you** in particular.
---
A claim about a several hour completition holds up to anyone who has zerk warrior/dh/slb and basic mounts. 
---
But, yeah, let's leave it be, you are set on your ideas as well. 
---
However, adults are not children. You should praise children for stuff because they don't have mental capabilities to derive pleasure from knowing they did well or improved (and no, a kid being happy about something doesn't mean it's happy about it, rather it's happy because it expects praise from their parents), but adults should be able to live off of their internal gratification, if you're searching for approval there's been something wrong with your development before the age of 20
---
Wait you can sell those?? I only just discovered a few days ago that mystic coins aren't Account bound. I made a cool 270 off of the stack I had in the bank.

This game is shit. Can't wait til they release "ascended shadow abyss" 2x darker!!!!
---
Remember when games were fun? And here we're sat talking about a corporation's bottom line. I'm not saying you're wrong to do so, but man does the soullessness of it all become apparent when you break things down.
---
son i grinded lineage 2 on 1x rates by the time you sucked your mother tits. but you are right,ive never seen any MMO dev which was able to just remove skills at mass or completly destroyed some class.
---
ok
---
Yup we haven't used gliding, bouncing mushrooms, mounts, any of them at all, since the map they were introduced on. That's totally how masteries work.
---
yes i do.
---
It's a bit more of a grind for me, mostly because I can only charge up one crystal a day, so i'm looking at a good 20 more days or so. But no, you're right, the grind is MUCH less than other mmo's. 
---
I think what it comes down to is "how much do you mind the labor" that makes an mmo grindy or not grindy. Wandering around forest zones that aren't too heavily populated and proceeding to murder every tree? Fun! Doing that in Orr or in places that have a heavy population of things that aggro? Grind. Getting a collection of seeds to unlock other seeds, just by doing what you were planning to do in the first place? A cool little bonus and incentive! Trying to get a friggin bird to drop a friggin piece of poultry just ONCE? Grind. Doing fractals with friends? A tasty bite-sized adventure! Doing fractals because you need to get to t4 and complete your ascended gear and you have only 10 agony resistance and you're pugging it? A certified torment in hell, also a grind. Doing any of the holiday jump puzzles? ....nope, no, that's always a grind for me. Start making your jp's charr-sized, arenanet

The Gobbler does provide this buff, but the inconvenience factor is real.   You can't pick your buff, you can only use the gobbler once every 5 seconds, and most of the uses from my experience are transformations.  Once you do get a karma boost, it is only for 15(?) minutes.   
---
So if you about to do the orphan run with a buddy and he has a booster and you a gobbler, he'll be done with his run and logged off his orphan runner to preserve his buff by the time you get an a hour long karma buff.  
---
Also keep in mind that this buff can come from communal bonfires that are still used during wintersday, but slowly becoming less common.
---
Dear Anet: I will throw five bucks at you if I can change my login screen. Not even new ones, existing ones I can swap out. Or just. change the login screen, at this point I hope for an expansion just so that it's not all yellow-tinted lighting and sand. It's the most useless feature but please.
---
fuck these stupid giveaways.. half of the entries don't work.. and regardless of how many fucking times I put in the message on twitter it still tells me that I didn't do it.
---
The performance is really bad now. It was never great, but these terrible lags and also 10fps on a machine with i9 9900k@5GHz, 32 gigs of RAM and Radeon VII, that is really bad. It used to be much better. The only thing that helps me get around 30fps is to lower character limit to minnimum, but then i dont see the enemy so what is the point. The bas performance is related to both character rendering and it is also server side performance issues which cause insane skill lags to the point where two groups just run in circles an no one can do anything. I sadly lost hope and nowadays I just log for daily reward and achievemnts and log off
---
Honestly if I didn't like the game as much as I do is quit it and never come back. I hate the lag so much. And it's so consistent for me. Every time after updates. It'll just be bad for days. It's gotten to the point where I don't do WvW, world boss events, and I dread updates. It's disappointing cause it frustrates me so much I often stop playing for a few days. Even stopped me for 2 months and I'm already wanting to stop again.
---
&gt; Why didn't you change Toss Elixir R? We did not originally plan to modify Toss Elixir R as we considered it fairly strong due to its 5 target cap and 170% total revive amount. With that said, we took another look at it and decided to make a few changes since there we felt that it being stopped by projectile destruction/reflection was too punishing for its recharge.
---
&gt; • Toss Elixir R: This skill no longer removes 1 condition when thrown. Increased projectile speed by 25%. The projectile thrown by this skill is now unblockable. Fixed an issue where the land and water versions of this skill moved at different speeds.
---
  
---
Hey, cool, a skill that wasn't touched for 3 and 5 years. And it's almost exactly the same for 7 years now.
---
I wonder, how is strength of a skill evaluated? Do they just look at the numbers? 
---
Apparently Signet of Mercy, instant AoE 5-target ress wasn't strong enough and needed a buff, and this is strong already? How come nobody uses it then?
---
Also, Elixir R will be now better and more reliable than Functionless Gyro, an elite spec mechanic. Engi is becoming funnier and funnier.
---
It's kind of amazing that Function gyro will be objectively worse than Elixir R.
---
But f-gyro sure will!
---
Its the circus most pride possession!
---
I’m stocking up on VM, lads!
---
Imagine actually being this pedantic
---
At the same time, you would be preventing weekend players to play and invest as much as they liked.
---
Lets say, for the sake of simplicity, devs put a new content that would take in average 14 hours to complete but they want the content to last atleast a week. They put time gates so every day one can do 2ish hours of this content.
---
The hardcore player who is able to play every day will finish the content at about a week. However, someone who plays only on weekend, because they may be too busy during the week, will finish this content in almost a month. Even though the weekend player is able to devote an entire Sunday to the content, as he doesn't have a job that day, he can only do 2ish hours of content that day.
---
So the same time gate can pad the content for much longer for players who may not be able to login everyday than hardcore players who login everyday. I see this as a punishment.
---
Keeps a certain sector of the fanbase playing for sure, but it would be great if they could backtrack on certain decisions based on feedback. Like charging for template slots
---
The "wait how the meta changes" is such a non-answer and you know they're just gonna keep it and never even listen to the feedback. What does meta even have to do with niche builds for fall damage reduction?
---
I guess it is the same kind of Bug like the Deco from Newyear is still in this own Instance from Episode 2
---
Wonder if Rare weapons work..
---
Login templates soon 😂
---
Oooooor.........Anet could just leave it the fuck alone and let people play the damn game they want instead of pruning and over-polishing everything away that their ZuckerBot9000 deemed not essential for human fun time, now with 17% more vitamin C. Fun time is to be had on working days during 19:52 and 20:12.
---
you're forced to use templates...those who didn't want it don't have a feature toggle.  we lost the auto swap in different game modes, if you've got a rev your utility is still completely fucked...  
---
With only 30 dollars you can now buy all the games...I'm at 7x that amount for the game (excluding gem cards). so that argument doesn't work for veteran players..new players usually don't care about that stuff yet because they haven't played the game enough to reach the limitations.  
---
&gt; 90% of the content in this sub is all about whining even before the template is released, 
---
and guess what...almost all of them had a valid point
---
yeah thats BS. you remember ppl complaining about anet not giving reasons why they balance skills/traits the way they do? well they changed it and now give good infos about that with each and every balance patch. and thats the way for how long now? 2, 3 years?
---
or heads up messages on their forums? they never did that in the beginning and now they do.
---
communication actually got better all the time over the years.
---
Fix: turn wells into shouts or quadruple their size and have them pulse their boons from the start.
---
There will be norn t4 outfit coming to the gemstore very soon
---
Or it's legacy code bullshit that they can't touch without having to build the game from the ground up. You never know. GW2 is seven years old, build on voodoo and held together by hacks and duct tape.
---
No, no, no. Anet bad. You're just a toxic whiteknight shill fanboy that makes it impossible for real fans to get Anet to become better by sucking them off all the time.
---
On a more serious note, we know that Anet CAN communicate. They did it a lot at the beginning, until MO took over, and still do it every now and then, like right now with their community changes in regards of WvW/PvP, or the examples you named. We also get a talkative dev every now and then to allow the ever-so-slightest insight.
---
But then again we get stuff like their glorified blog post in a cinema.
---
I wonder what about their policies prevents them from entering a continuous exchange with their playerbase.
---
guardian already has good ressing tools, they don't need another aoe ress
---
Ah, yes. The lava cannons that shoot you across the map. Those are great.
---
This is the bit where someone reveals that the spirit has been deliberately left by development for lore purposes.
---
Ben P has been amazing with communication, and Cal Cohen has been fantastic on the forum. His ideas for balance also actually seem to be stemming from the community and the meta, rather then whatever the heck they were doing before.
---
PvP being the least toxic gamemode now, what a time to be alive.
---
ADHD and dyslexia can co-exist. Although one disorder doesn’t cause the other, people who have one often have both.
---
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with ADHD also have a learning disorder such as dyslexia.
---
In fact, their symptoms at times can be similar, making it hard to figure out what’s causing the behavior you’re seeing.
---
Honestly, nobody ever picks a trait because it offers fall dmg reduction. If you are getting pushed off a cliff it's usually death anyway (air keep, hills, above fire keep, SunnyWoodenView tower), there's very few places that fall dmg trait would safe you if pushed down with full health. And even if you pick it, it's still a lottery anyway, nobody ever thought *Yes, I can make that fall coz I have the fall damage reduction!*, it's always *Shit can I make it?*

NC soft is not active in Europe, so, they have little to nothing partners in Europe

Holy shit is this so hard so understand this is a simple oversight from arenanet from the times when alacrity was not a boon? They simply did not update the text box that op shows after making jt a boon.
---
&gt; Can I ask a mes to do the raid for me because I don't have the patience or skill to raid?
---
Yes, you can! It's called raid selling
---
Well, do they have any people capable of delivering changes/balance to those game modes? Last time I checked they didn't have a proper balance team and all changes were based on whinings of silver players. Which didn't even help silver players because balance team didnt undestand what made certain builds powerful.
---
I feel like we're currently at a point of no return - unless they do proper focus group interviews and surveys, something is getting fucked up again.
---
Signet of mercy reuzes one player
---
yes he did, but that similarity was the joke ._.
---
bruh...
---
## bruh 😜😡😤🤙😜
---
And after you cast it you are under the cobdition of near death experience.
---
That just breeds other problems thou. Last time I checked most vocal PvP players weren't in plat, they were silver players who didn't understand the game fully. Listening to players is amazing but if companies like riot implemented changes based on opinions of low-ranks complaining about higher skill-ceiling builds, there would be a mess. Which is what we have had for years in terms of balance and build diversity.
---
Remember months of condi dmg nerfs because ~75% players were running 1 or no cleanse sources? This is sadly what balancing based on forums and player input gets us.
---
I agree with your first point, it'd be nice to put into a mastery line. I think that would be the best way to do it, since honestly there's not much interesting gameplay that you can do with reduced fall damage.
---
Disagree with it being alongside the gliding debuff part. That would seem a bit awkward to me and having to check whether if you had a certain buff (or debuff) on to estimate your fall damage would feel a bit clunky imo.
---
They communicate but they don't understand PvP or WvW. Then they make a decisions based on complaints of PvE players and abandon those gamemodes for months. Every time they promised big changes, build diversity decreased and so did skill ceiling.
---
He meant PvP players.
---
Dammit! Sorry :(
---
Nah that's really just this subreddit. The forums actually have a lot of good players on them with recognizable names.
---
They do. But they aren't the majority there either, especially when PvE players start giving their input to the Devs :/
---
Yes, we have no way of finding out though and gw2 has some pretty dedicated white knights so you can never tell which is which. They argue with a passion that money can't buy.
---
Cal Cohen is friends with the rank 1 on the NA leaderboard. That rank 1 player is a self-admitted silver 3 player. He also admitted someone reached out to him to see if he wanted to buy the #1 spot for 5,000g.
---
Suddenly he moves from silver 3 to rank 1...cause that’s totally normal. So is having a 90% + win ratio, something even top streamers don’t even have.
---
This is the state of PvP and the game. Sorry but Anet has no integrity. And even worse they sanction cheating
---
If you think that's bad take a look at the destiny 2 shader system.
---
That's the issue.  If you can't get on for the day to do whatever is time gated (which may or may not take some time to do), you can't catch up again the next day, i.e. you'll always be "down" the days you miss.
---
Which one and what are they doing wrong?
---
The whole lot covered in watermarks, sortive detracts from the design.
---
I always find going overboard with watermarks to be ashame, I understand it, but it is ashame.
---
I would remove the melotong blob body after the M. And just have him look like he's holding the name head on.
---
That, or give him back legs and a tail.
---
And his left claw, looks a little missed placed.
---
Other than that  I like it, it would make a cool badge/Guild logo.
---
Anet nerfed boon chrono propably "because it's too strong" but then allowes the entirety of firebrand to exist.

I just hope it won't be another Vabbi-like area, where we must be fast to hop from a safe bubble to another without having time to slowly explore, and relax, and I doubt Skimmer will save us in this map like it did in Vabbi.
---
Grinding toons to level 80 running in the zerg on the Edge of the Mists
---
If you mean elite specs? They are unlocked with 250 hero points each so yes you will still need to unlock them.
---
Yeah it is frustrating bu kind at necessary. If you could that with just a typical password reset any compromised e-mail and there are a lot of those around would lead to a hacked account and lose everything. 
---
&gt; instead of waiting for support who will probably just send me a password reset email without this information anyways.
---
Didn't just complain that they asked you to provide more information than that in the previous sentence?
---
No. Any change is better than no change. Stagnation is the death of an always online game.
---
Only in Dredgehaunt. All but bear give a boon for 5 minutes.
---
Bear starts an event if it isn't on cooldown, and completing it gives a tiny +%Power buff. 
---
The shrines in other maps do nothing.
---
As /u/pathogems said, you need 250 Hero Points to unlock them.
---
But it's important to note that the Hero Challenges in the expansion maps grant 10 points, while the ones in core Tyria grant 1. Meaning you only need to do 25 challenges if they are done in the expansion exclusive maps.
---
If you have done world completion of the main world, then you'll have a bunch of saved points to use as well.
---
I'm stuck waiting for support to reply to my email. They will most likely end up looking at the account, matching the name and D.O.B and then sending me a reset password link. Turning what should take minutes into a process that now takes hours.
---
That sounds like an abusive relationship.
---
"If I stick with him maybe he won't beat me any more."
---
Look at the post history, particularly the submitted comments.
---
Best mmo ever.
---
It's pure PR. 
---
Look at this from another angle, when the changes go live: 
---
Are the changes any different from proposed by Anet?
---
Are community's voice included?
---
No?
---
I won't be surprised.
---
You can use them to promote less valuable crafting materials to more valuable crafting materials:
---

---
Current most profitable use is turning bronze ingots into iron ingots (1.5g profit per shard), although the specific best recipe varies from moment to moment based on market conditions.
---
Boonbeast, which uses axes/sword/warhorn is the best roaming/dueling build for ranger so lets nerf longbow AA damage because longbow ranger couldnt keep up with holo/mesmer/thief before anyways. Wait what?
---
Isn't only about these two. I wanna see any thief spec reaching renegade numbers on dhuum. And again as above. I merely said you don't have the potential using only one class to reach the numbers that are possible. Give me those 40k on  a deadeye at MO currently please that a base guard is able to reach.
---
If you had characters on that 7 years old account, it would be worth it to wait for the password reset for the birthday gifts.
---
Maybe an officer went crazy and kicked people. 🤷
---
i wouldn't say its bad,  last week we had a holo who was top dps on most bosses.
---
the problem with holo is that it's hard. why would you play holo when you can play DH or DD.
---
Hey! Sorry was off a day.
---
\-Not sure I'm good at dodging. If you mean dodging many times I don't like it
---
\-I prefer more to  survivability 
---
\-I have both HoT/Pof
---
No, it's not. Every decently balanced game has balanced high-end first. Without balance competitive environments will never be fun, not even for casual players. You think low-end builds being exceptionally strong is fun for casuals? It means they run those builds, without variety, or get punished out by scrubs and anyone better alike. 
---
You should take lower levels and their fun into account - but it should NEVER be a priority over fixing high end balance. And anet has repeatedly screwed their balance by listening to, in all honesty, people so low down the ladder the concept of balance doesn't even impact them. In all honesty, GW2 isn't close enough to a balanced state to consider low end. It should be ignored entirely. 
---
Every presently competitive game is balanced around high-end. And all games succesful at doing this have a much larger casual audience than GW2. If a game has a solid scene of players, it advertises itself and it's worthwhile investing into. It has diversity and competition throughout the ladder. 
---
In GW2 - the more new players get invested the more they realise it's a honeytrap; because bad players expect anet's design to overcome their L2P issues.
---
Same goes for "don't nerf, just buff". It's retarded and it fucks casual players more than anyone else in the long run. But they don't realise because they're too pepega to realise how balance influences their game.
---
Long ago (few months after launch) I built the first zerker necro build and wanted to test it. I was roaming with my friend and we stopped to talk for a little while. After that, I noticed behind us 2 thieves put a Shadow Refuge. I told my friend "watch this". I calculated in my big mind when they will approximately reach me and put wells under me and then shroud 4. They appeared downed under my foot. My friend "WTF" -ed his mind out as he didn't know about the theives at all. 
---
This is the first encounter for that build, while everyone was laughing at necros.
---
My main is Warrior so I decided to make a second char + I started this game a few month ago:) So crfat isn't rdy yet yes:)
---
If I learned anything from 15 years of wow devs (lookin at you, ghostcrawler) its that they'll often say stuff like "We hear you, we are listening" then go completely against the common opinion of what is OP.
---
&gt; Kaufland or Lidl
---
Lidl please, never heard of the other, but pretty much any European country I visited has Lidl :D

---
People still take downstate jade winds on rev even though there is a strictly better option, theres definitely someone who looked at a fall damage trait and took it just incase they have to throw themselves off a cliff.
---
Go to the leather farm in lake Doric.
---
still only tolerating the balls because we *still* don't have a toggle or aura-less alternative. but hey, it's only been 2.5 years so far.
---
I'm not aware of one, although I'm sure it could potentially be crawled out of the wiki.
---
You can take a look at the whole Sanctuary Runes and Abrasive Grit conundrum. When that rune was updated, every singe Scourge was running that rune to stack insane amounts of boons and other horrific things. The community loved the interaction with the Rune but they generally wanted the Rune to be toned down. Thought in the end, it was the Scourge trait that got hit for the change.
---
Likewise if you look at the hot-fixes CMC made almost a few days after the first feedback forum post, you can see changes for Staff Thief and Condi Thief. These two builds were dominant in sPvP due to the amount of spam (Of poison and dodges respectively) and players from **all** ranks made an outcry for it.
---
And with these next set of changes reflect those complaints on the forums. These aren't just regular pub-players you see in unranked just posting; Grimjack, Baristen and others are all voicing their complaints and opinions. You may be right about the PR aspect, but CMC is definitely forcing his way onto the balance of the game.
---
https://gw2lunchbox.com/MaterialUpgrades.html
---
That site will tell you whether transmuting materials is a net gain or loss
---
Given the complexity of the issue and the priorities (bug fixing), collecting the edback, discuss changes, plan changes, develop them, and so on. No, it's not a lot. I work as a developer and sometimes even the smallest change needs to go through a long process between departments and goes back and forth to come up with a valid plan, this process can take ages, months, even years in some cases.
---
Expecting changes or even communication in the first weeks is very unrealistic
---
Nah the forums are mostly filled with monkeys. The majority of the good players give feedback on a discord.
---
When glyphs released, we could pick one free glyph. I picked leatherworker one, and put it into my endless axe. That way I get quite a lot of leather when chopping trees. My material storage now has 500gold worth of leather and I didn't farmed any on purpose.
---
There is alternative of this (if you don't want to get glyph that is quite expensive on TP), that is buying limited-use tools with same effect for karma (for example: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leatherworker%27s_Logging_Axe ).
---
This is best for regular play as you usually gather nodes that you intercept during travels. Having maxed home instance (or friend that will let you in his one), guild hall....those harvesting daily are good value. Playing WvW and gathering loot bags from fights and getting those synthetizers as well. You can park some toons on some JPs, for example Siren's Landing, those do give some materials to recycle into wood, cloth, leather and ores. Those are all "longterm" farms that you can play just normally and you will have full material storage over time.
---
If you want some quick focused farm, then Lake Doric for sure, or T4 maps and buy leather shipments.
---
Except this is a videogame, and nobody is being bullied or cheated by the game devs. To take something like videogame development personally is truly unhealthy.
---
throwing a tantrum on reddit wont help you either
---
I don't know if you're on crack or something but there are no ways of handling this. Anet doesn't listen, it never has and it never will
---
You are messing terminology.
---
Masteries are not related to classes, you can't get them before getting expansion although you will get mastery points from mastery related achievements you already did, so you won't lose anything. Mastery exp on the other hand is not accumulating for you. 
---
And about professions, I believe you mean elite specializations. Consider them to be just another specialisation line. You develop it with Hero Points and you can keep getting them in core areas so you can get them ahead and greatly speed up unlocking elite as soon as you buy expansion.
---
A long time ago after Dhuumfire on Necro was first introduced, I solo defended a tower on alpine BL from an entire 20-person Zerg. They didn’t all rush in at once but trickled in as apparently they were semi distracted elsewhere after they took down the gate. I killed them 3-4 at a time, fearing some off the walls to their death and outright annihilating the others. At the end the commander entered with 4 other players, the largest group yet, and it truly felt like a boss battle out of a game like Dark Souls or something as I deftly LoS’d and dodged at 2k HP, barely hanging on. By the end, I stomped the commander and had killed the rest, and truly felt like a god amongst mere mortals.
---
And that’s basically my fondest and most dear memory of WvW. I’ve never been able to truly leave the game mode after experiencing something like that.
---
"They're ignoring all the feedback"
---
\--he says, unironically, in a thread about a follow-up post where a dev directly addresses the feedback in the thread. Holy shit.
---
professions and masteries ARE NOT related, so i'm not sure what you're asking about
---
pretty sure buying the trophy ones, selling them and then buying the leather from the tp is much cheaper
---
Wait, you browse reddit without ublock?
---
That mount is cancer as someone new to wvw. You have no chance to do anything whatsoever now. Before you could at least try to sneak little objectives to keep your participation up, but now? Die instantly in zergs, die instantly trying to reach your little camp by a guy going 300km/h on their Mount.
---
Wvw is a walking simulator. Fuck that mode.

I still don't understand how falling dmg has become a thing ? It works already and we dont care about this right ?

Not here cause I like it if that's what you're thinking
---
You didnt answer my question is what Im thinking.
---
u should look for holosmith then, scrapper is more supportish
---
Yes, every decently balanced game will have a very balanced high-end, which isn't obtained by catering to a minority of self-proclaimed high-end players, as they naturally fall into the builds that have the potential to deliver the higher numerical values. Most healing, most damage, most CC upkeep on enemies, etc.
---
You hardly ever see players reporting builds they know are a balance outlier instead using them. At most you'd see the occasional player that will go "Well, let's be honest, this has to go" but they will still use it until it's fixed.  
---
Of course, when the interaction is between players, you will see the very opposite. They will recognize the actual problematic elements when talking to each other, and even ban them from player-made competitions. 
---
Often to keep high-end balanced or to prepare the game for further future changes, developers often have to go against what vocal groups of high-end players want. Of course not all communities are exactly the same, but it generally applies to all. 
---
When it comes to PvP balance, you have to go full House M.D. : listen to players, but do not take anything any of them say at face value. Have your own metrics, and get good at processing what players are actually communicating by comparing feedback and real data.  
---
And not just metrics and feedback. There's other factors that help when checked, like watching player-made competitions to see whether they are adding rules like forbidding a skill, a trait, or a profession from being more than once in a match, or even an entire elite spec or profession altogether. 
---
They also have to record which builds get reported the most for cheating even when the player isn't cheating, as that tells you what builds feel too powerful or too unfun to fight against, or have visuals that are too obscure and are not properly showing what's happening to players facing them.  
---
A player getting an occasional report from cheating is flattering, a player getting 1 or 2 every match is a pattern.
---
And none of that means that entry levels can be ignored as long as high-end is fine.
---
Even if high-end is balance, if entry levels are not fun, the game mode will die due to player depletion. Keeping entry level fun is a must.
---
scrapper is good utility heal for the team but he has his place in biggwr groups in that role, not sure about solr pve possibilities but probably.you can find sth to have fun with
---
We already have those repair kits, but it would be better if they don't occupy space.
---
My point isn't doing low end balance, it's doing balance at all levels. That cannot be done by ignoring low level feedback. 
---
When balance is properly done across all game mode and competitive tiers, that always results in a bit of catering to entry level for the sake of keeping the game fun for them, because high-end players by definition can adapt to anything, but entry level players can't as they are still learning.  
---
But that 'catering' doesn't necessarily means dumbing down the game or making things simplistic. More often than not involves addressing obscure mechanics, unintuitive gimmicks and adjusting the pace when things get too hectic.
---
That's the next step. I just farmed enough hero points for one and I picked Scrapper, so once I get into Pot I'm gonna farm points for Holosmith
---
Yeah, I'm gonna try Holo once I get enough points. I was expecting that kind of change like I felt when switching from mesmer to mirage or from necro to reaper.
---
What exactly is that lost game-wide function and depth?
---
All uses of fall damage reduction that comes to mind are a small limited list:
---
* Help in JPs
---
* Certain skips in dungeons. 
---
* A few gimmicks in raids. 
---
* Surviving being thrown off a cliff in WvW.
---
* Very few locations in PvP maps, mostly shortcuts.
---
What else is there?
---
Double xp weekend probably around a year ago. Our zerg sat inside a t3 langor and instead of flipping it we just camped on the portal inside. I made over 25 wvw levels just casting lava fonts and meteor showers on the door. I got 2 kegs (5 wvw levels each) from all the bodies. Best 45 mins of my wvw experience.
---
I don't think something can be called 'a challenge' when the most challenging part of it is managing to tag anything before it gets killed with DPS bursts.
---
No ,you get both be starting the expansions.
---
They are account unlocks, so you'd need one character at level 80 to unlock them.
---
I mean. Get all of tem and swap between em when needed., for Wvw I think staff/hammer is meta tho.
---
No game company does that but ok
---
But it's also correct
---
I would, but when I say I want to master two setups, I mean MASTER. I mean I need to play a long time before I get good (at any game, specially this one). I also mean I'll be looking up video tutorials on the weapon setup, spend lots of gold on the coolest skins for those weapons I end up using, etc.
---
So just doing all of them is possible... but not really feasible on my time or wallet. xD
---
My fondest is commanding the hell out of Sorrow's Furnace in order to get ahead on the 1st WvW Tournament. And after I was burnt out, just going out to Lion's Arch to try to convince people to go support us for at least 30 minutes, that that could make a difference.  
---
All in all, Sorrow's was third place against all odds at the time.

Do meta weapons change? In two years is staff hammer still gonna be best for rev WVW?
---
how do you know he doesn't play? he seems to have the gist of it down.
---
Thank you a lot I really appreciate it. I might start learning the rotation, I have some experience with my mirage.

Tbh I really miss EotM trains. It was relaxing and I loved that I could join it whenever I had the time. Regular WvW has its moments, but we don't have good fights 24/7 and it kinda sucks to come in at an odd hour and earn little more than some pips.
---
maybe do some research first?
---
Then I guess I’m insane since I’ll still say to keep the messages up and make our opinions known. After all the alternative is to say and do nothing about the situation, which isn’t going to fix anything.
---
Unfortunately in this game swapping weapons is common practice. As weapons are situational.
---
QOL! QOL! QOL!
---
A long time ago, a few friends and I were defending Redlake with a pug. It became obvious we weren't going to fight off the opposing zerg so the pug said "hey come build this it'll be funny." So we built a ram at the top of the first set of stairs and drained the supplies. The zerg broke the wall, ran in, and then all got knocked back exactly once by the ram at the top of the stairs by the pug. It didn't do anything to help but he was right, it was really funny.
---
for big zerg fights yes, but if u want to roam or do small scale hammer is pretty much useless cuz it has very slow skills that are easy to avoid
---
I'd imagine staff is good for wvw due to the block, aoe condi cleanse and the skill 5 evade/ interrupt. It isn't really a dps weapon though. Be useful in zergs
---
(Disclaimer- I don't play my rev in wvw)
---
Woah I can imagine! What a badass story, it's moments like those you wish you could relive.
---
Wooden potatoes has an open world scrapper build on his channel.
---
Isn't the whole game optional?
---
I remember roaming without mounts.. fun times
---
"As one does" haha, yeah the Obsidian Sanctum was chaos for awhile. Always a cool moment when teaming up with another server like that. I suck at 1v1 or small engagements like that so I personally feel that struggle to run as fast as my coward legs could take me haha.
---
Like "I just cleaned this place up!"
---
When the game first launched, people were still trying to angle for Server pride in WvW, defending Stonemist castle and going to LA to recruit people to join the cause was a great time.
---
I’ll still keep on regardless. Others may have given up but I’ll keep on until either the game dies or the changes fly.
---
I think we all have unintentionally thrown ourselves of a cliff in WvW, it's part of the experience! I know the feeling of being made into a hunt by some thief roamer, horrific, glad you could put some down.
---
Talk about feeling like a badass after doing something like that! I don't think you will ever find anything to top that.
---
Well an actual start would be to give a reasonable eta. Not just every 6 months them regurgitating #soon for millionth time
---
Haha, free loot is free. I like that it worked for so long, they really did not seem to learn :P.
---
Threeway battles in SM are always chaotic fun! Too bad with the crashes \^\^
---
Mind doing that with a https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hylek_Blue_Hue_Potion ?  Curious how it would look.
---
I initially joined WvW on my necro and didn't do anything because I couldn't find my way out of spawn on the borderlands. 
---
My fondest memory of WvW is when I somehow accidentially pulled someone into a tree near SE camp with a Dragonhunter pull
---
Close up would be when HoT released and we lost Fire Keep because nobody knew where the Lord's Room was.
---
That is actually really honorable. I have felt in recent years that has been missing, many people are quite unfriendly to newcomers instead of lending an open hand. It is especially needed now with all the elite specs that has complicated the WvW meta a lot more compared to its vanilla days. Kudos!

Oof, yeah. When the enemy zerg is between you and your team, and you're just trying to find sneaky ways around so you dont have to run 10+ minutes back again
---
I play as a condi-tank Scourge with Trailblazer gear, Mirage runes and Truffle-Meat stew, when I don't have ascended food on, with Tuning Icicles.
---
Melee types don't last long around me and Deadeye are the bane of my existance.
---
Hahaha yup, yup. The beta was amazing cause nobody had a clue what they were doing haha. Thanks for sharing the pictures as well
---
Let me answer that with another question: of how many ways to use fall damage reduction can the minds and creativity of one million players come up with?
---
I personally could add a few more to your list, but that most likely still wouldn't cover it.
---
So how about we do it the other way around. Instead of looking for reasons to allow a mechanic to exist, we look for a reason to remove it? Then we don't have to pretend that were able to fathom all that is lost.
---
Edit: Not that it'd be needed, your short list is more than enough, but hey.
---
I used to play a ton of wvw. But sadly, haven't touched it for several years now. Was surprised some time ago when somebody recognised me as a sorrows furnace commander. I was like: oh wow.
---
As a alaren i use sword sword in fractal. I keep hammer as secondary weapon just for the style even if staff would be better. Sadly shield is useless
---
Secret tech: have your alac ren camp Mallyx, it trivializes the fight. One skill pulls enemies, one skill removes conditions from allies and grants then resistance, and another skill removes boons on enemies. This allows the party to focus entirely on the floor indicator mechanics, making the fight easy.
---
The main NA hardcore raiding guild, holds a few world records considering how new they are.
---
The feedback which majority is "don't remove it". 
---
"Holy shit." Indeed.
---
The focus on such changes is bad news for PvP. There was hope with a new guy dedicated to competive balancing it gets better. But it wont when trait design is in the hand of the same people who are responsible for the poor state of competitive class balance.
---
I hope we get a new login screen but it’s not the end of the world if we don’t get one.
---
I don't get why people playing Guild wars use the term "duelist" or "1vs1" anymore, when pvp has become all about assasisns who jump and burst each others in 2 to 3 secs before the enemy has even the chance to counter attack. This kind of combat has nothing to do with "dueling".

---
You should carry every type of weapon and armor that each build uses for whatever game mode you want to play. That’s why having equipment loadouts is good.
---
The downvotes are just part of this sub don’t take it to heart.
---
Not a fan of the balance changes. These changes make the races require a complete change in tactics, gameplay, build, etc. Way too much of that. I can't be switching from playing one style then forced into something completely different. Sure, stay with the same build finding yourself weaker than you were before.
---
They keep screwing up, rebalancing, it's a vicious cycle. All because of minority forum heavy complainers. 
---
The content is great but I'm not sure if I want to continue having to learn a whole damn specialty every balance change. They're never going to get this right.
---
Farming what material you need isn't the best route.  Farming gold is.  Farm gold from the most profitable places like LS4 meta train and then buy the leather you need.
---
Depending on your region and time available to play won't matter too much because people usually spend a few hours doing them.  Just check the LFG tabs in-game.
---
I'll give you the best answer then. Just max out your masteries.
---
it doesn't matter what we do, anet will do what anet will do. people wage forum wars to get a release of the frustration that gets built up when you have to deal with anet, i think everyone knows deep down that it doesn't really matter, it's a coin toss whether they will fuck up the game more or less with each update.
---
While this doesn't directly answer your question, you can still earn Spirit Shards randomly by killing enemies or opening champion loot bags.  Being unable to gain them from 'levelling up' in one region of the game isn't going to cost you all that much, especially because converting Spirit Shards to gold is a rather painful, time-consuming process that is usually less efficient than going out in the game and earning gold by playing it.  So while it might be annoying, not gaining Spirit Shards from levelling up in Path of Fire isn't going to severely cripple you by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Spawn more overlords
---
We require more vespene gas.
---
Good Luck, we are still waiting on a fix for legendary armor
---
So you think it’s normal for a silver 3 player to have a 94% win ratio? Do you even play pvp? Half the games teammates afk after the first mid fight, or when they try to 1v1 far and lose, some even just never leave the base, or some log out before match starts... 
---
The current matchmaking is too volatile to have win ratios like that. Even the good top streamers can’t maintain those ratios because there is only so much you can do.
---
I don’t know what more proof you need than the dude posting on forums stating he’s a silver 3 player at best and people have approached them asking them if they wanted to buy the top slot. Only for him to be in the top slot next season. As well as the screenshots and footage people had of the players begging to throw so they didn’t lose rating, even offering gold mid match. But Anet takes those posts down...
---
They already do this in pve. If you are suspected of botting/cheating in any form. They have devs observe to make sure. Then if they aren’t sure, they try to engage in a conversation to see if you are there. If that doesn’t work they will literally move your character and see how you react.
---
Just have them spectate matches he’s in off and on (record the games he’s in) and have security look over to see plus things look legitimate or not.
---
For raid-related Crystalline Heart achievements, if you clear the boss but don’t get the achievement, do you have to wait another week to try again?
---
EDIT: I’m specifically asking about Cairn. I killed him this week already but got hit by Spatial Manipulation. Was wondering if I could try again or if I have to wait for weekly reset.
---
Unless I didn't pay decent enough attention to the link you provided me, I was thinking more in the lines of exotic gear that is an alternative to Bladed gear, since most of the core gear can be obtained on the Trading Post, whereas the HoT and PoF stats are much more difficult to obtain.
---
Nope, you can repeat it as much as you want.
---
Carrying noobs in t4 with my heal scrapper is like a walk in the park.
---
Someone who is level 80 and has the expansions can carry you through the instance to get the raptor but gliding is unlocked through the mastery system so you will need to have at least one level 80 character for that. If you’re on NA, I can help you get the mount!
---
They will stop responding or providing any information soon enough, don't worry.  They do this every 6 months to a year once a threshold has been reached and then they'll disappear once again.
---
ah ok , its been so long...i don't even remember how to find it.
---
No it was before desert map.
---
And I have no memory of cats.
---
They do, often. I killed it a few days ago for a guild member, did exactly as you said minus the bounty train, had 20 people in less than 10 minutes.
---
How is this even remotely a priority issue is beyond me.
---
Same although it would be cool if I could swap it back to the Heart of Thorns theme login screen, that music is awesome.
---
Try waiting 2 weeks to approved by Apple if you don’t have a second Apple product or a month from Microsoft
---
&gt;So you think it’s normal for a silver 3 player to have a 94% win ratio?
---
I already explained how they do it. They duo queue in off hours and ask their friends (which, after so many people have left the game, includes almost the entirety of the top tier competitive scene) not to queue at the same time. If there's someone who they can't ask to do that, they queue dodge them. They duo queue as a weird class to force their enemies into an unfavorable comp and then swap to whatever is going to make their games easier. It's not something people are going to want to stream for multiple reason: the games are boring because of the time zone, the breaks between games are inconsistent because of queue dodging, and it's just overall not fun.
---
&gt;I don’t know what more proof you need
---
I've said exactly what proof I need. Take those screenshots and videos and post them on reddit instead of the forums. The forums are cancer, and the subreddit hates PvP. They upvote any PvP related drama to the top of the subreddit to emphasize how toxic the community is. Historically, it's also the only way to actually get action taken against cheaters in PvP, much to my frustration. ArenaNet only responds to PvP cheating when it hits the top of the subreddit.
---
&gt;Just have them spectate matches he’s in off and on
---
Ben does actually investigate the accounts of the players who place top 10 for a few different things. As I mentioned previously, he makes sure the account isn't being accessed by multiple people, so you can be sure it's the actual player on the account. In that scenario, you're probably not going to see them making offers for people to throw through ingame chat (and that's why I suspect your screenshots/videos are from a long time prior.
---
&gt;Do you even play pvp?
---
I don't play the game anymore, as I quit after being banned in the null hash fiasco back in last April. However, I did play frequently with and against these players, as I used to play the game competitively. You may or may not recognize the name Olrun. I experienced plenty of cheating, such as DDoS attempts (mostly from the EU players), teammates being paid to decline queues (I'm looking at you Miaz), partners spectating the match while in Discord with Naru's team and giving them our splits (Marvin confirmed snake), and lots of other scumbaggery. There are things that can be handled by ArenaNet, though, and things that can't be. Stuff that happens outside of the game client isn't something that's their responsibility. Even back in Pro League, all they could do about DDoS attempts was to e-mail us information about how to protect ourselves. What they do currently is either allowed (even if it's shady) or handled outside of the game client (where it isn't something ArenaNet can realistically deal with).
---
I understand your frustration, but you're being unreasonable.
---
Adblock my dude
---
You have to account for the fact that the goal is t6 leather and not all tiers of leather.
---
After selling the trophies you can buy 77 t6 leather. 
---
If you get the leather shipment then you would still need to sell the t1-5 leathers. According to the drop rate from the wiki you'll get around 8 t6 leather from a ship on average so the other leathers would need to provide enough gold for at least 69 t6 leather.
---
Truth
---
I recently got the griffon and in my case, I was able to start getting spirit shards once I was done with all the griffon masteries. I guess the beetle and skyscale are the two mounts that don't influence the XP bar for POF since they were only released in LW4. 
---
If you have the 250 gold to buy the merchant items for the collection, I definitely recommend getting the griffon. It's pretty quick and definitely worth it. If you're having issues with content that requires more players, just shout in guild/map chat or post on lfg during prime time, I didn't have issues finding people who were willing to help.
---
Hidden is not same as locked. 
---
Locked *will* interfere which is the problem with how they handled beetle. The skyscale had the same problem which was fixed by hiding it but they didn't apply the same fix to the beetle.
---
On the other hand you still get shards from random drops so doing any content which has you killing a lot of stuff that drops loot will work.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
No.... just no.... Monentization is like a plague that needs to be stopped or else it will just continue until one day it will even piss you off.  By then, most dedicated players have already moved on :(
---
while they surely could handle the shipping I think it would be more of a hassle for the one receiving it.
---
For example, I had a device bought in the US and shipped to Germany, I paid import taxes to even get it. Then it broke and I send it back to get a new one and had to pay import taxes again on the new devices. Now, this was only like 100 bucks for the price of the device (19 bucks import taxes) now imagine having to pay the taxes on 500+ bucks, I doubt ArenaNet will send you the money as compensation. I would have to pay ~100 bucks as import taxes for that monitor.
---
Or, just imagine the price getting damaged overseas or held by customs... all of those things could be something they don't want to go through.
---
I can only vaguely remember it, but that would also be a really nice feature as well!
---
Yeah. Except they don't want to. So every time something gets drastically "fixed" in one mode, it fucks up the others. But devs keep refusing to do more drastic split. Before the argument was "it'd be too confusing".
---
https://imgur.com/a/6CYfYMV
---
Sorry for the quick crop. Anything incomplete?
---
No, he checks to make sure they aren't cheating, account sharing being the primary method used for a while. It's not Ben's job to police who Malediktus plays with or punish him for breaking rules that don't exist. A lot of these problems exist because the community is already so small. It isn't something you can really fix at this point. There isn't enough competition to prevent this from happening.
---
Yeah, the Roller Beetle and the Crystal Champion tacks. Both from season 4. It's not the griffon that's your problem.
---
Alright, I mean, 50% of people are telling me locked stuff doesn't stop it and 50% tell me the other thing. The game has been out over half a decade, why isn't there more clear info on these sorts of things?
---
Roxx quiver please....
---
It was in one of the closed betas. When people actually played the mode how it was "intended" aka  building siege equipment, no zergs, kind of tactical war gameplay. And it only worked because EVERYONE was shitty. Now WvW is what it is because people can't help but metagame.
---
It's really not.
---
The "communication" they're giving is just, "here's the next dumb balance patch idea." Followed by, "we hear your feedback, and here's why we're not changing a damn thing, fuck you."
---
That's not "incredibly refreshing." It's incredibly frustrating.
---
Well there is LaunchBuddy but that won't change the actual login screen, just let you have a pre-log in screen you can fully customise, kind of like a better version of the beta login screen.
---
Entering in there with my noob pve ranger or mesmer build and still win 100% of 1v1 and most 1v2 and 1v3.
---
Doing the puzzles, especially the 1st time I managed to complete obsi sanctum. Later, doing this puzzle in peace while all eb keeps were my color
---
My first memory is going to OS about a week of release, with a friend. Back then you had to access OS through a well within the main keep. Many times we slipped through the enemy that had recently captured the keep, and a third enemy that was holed up there with siege equipment. It was a trying task climbing the arena room with the room's invisibility, which hindered your movements, and a barrage of arrows raining from above, but the thrill of actually making it through and breaking the siege was probably the best moment I've had in WVW.
---
Buy keys if you get to a T6 map, open chest during sandstorms.  Tag as many events as you can during sandstorms, if you have time during the rest of the hour, get the map tier as high as possible by completing events.
---
Never miss going there when there's a daily event completer achievement for Dry Top as there will be more people and the tier will be higher.  
---
Also, get enough people to convince ANet to add a "Group" system to the LFG (basically like the [Communities](https://www.diablowiki.net/Community) in Diablo III) so people can join large groups for people to get together and organize runs like TT, Tequatl, Dry Top, Hot and PoF metas and the like without having to waste a guild slot for such specific things.
---
There's also weekly vendors in festivals who often sell bags of currency.
---
The fall damage trait on warriors and elementalists particularly can be really fun, and I really hope they don't arbitrarily remove it just because they think it's extra.
---
Yep.  Still play other games with two of them!
---
First memory of gw1 , coming home from Iraq 2006 and starting to play. I spent all weekend playing(when not in PT). All those extra days off after deployment were spent leveling a Bond Mesmer/Mink healer and my Splintbarrage ranger/Necro. 
---
Fondest,  I made a PVP warrior-Ele; Hammer + Wind(knockdown) skills = Thor Build, it didn’t do much Dmg, but man it was fun to interrupt other players so much.
---
First memories:

I died a lot trying to solo roam on necro

This fight music from Eye of the North was there during the beta weekends as far as I remember, but it's been removed because it was too long for the regular mob fights. 
---
Though, we got bounties, world bosses and strike missions with bosses that are longer to kill. This music would fit perfectly well for a boss fight in the Far Shiverpeaks :)
---
GW1 music was just amazing all the way through and i actually find it weird of how much i enjoyed this music yet if you ever told me to listen to classical music or some for of adventure themed composition
---
 piece i'd have never given it a second thought.
---
Old news and likely has something to do with their cancelled projects.
---
The skyscale is hidden. Now at least, it wasn't on release but they changed that much. I'm surprised they didn't for the other ones.
---
Tangled Depths is such a clusterfuck not even Anet knows all the pathways out of there.
---
I have no idea why you would never get the roller beetle. Not a hard achievement and it's a fun to use.
---
If you don't have that episode, I highly recommend getting it JUST for that little ball of chitin.
---
Don't worry, shadow abyss is a nice dye but you nee to mix it, example gold colors add a Versace touch to many elegant or military looks, silver/crystals effects colors, give a sense of classy behind ragged or sultry etc... neon can go from the 60's beetlemania to Revo looks. of course looks of character count towards, but even with all the complains on the basics of fashion "the little black dress" is a winner because the jewelry popped on it, just remember to accessorize aka make details in different colors.
---
Remember, wear the clothes and don't let the clothes wear you.
---
Guild Warcraft
---
Yes ! 
---
I was happy to hear some of Nightfall's tracks coming back into PoF, and with Bound by Blood they even added an old music you could hear in Sorrows' Furnace and during the Halloween event in GW1.
---
I hope some of GW:EN's old musics make their way into the LS !
---
I literally never said thats the only place they take feedback from?
---
The moment you FULLY UNLOCK griffon/beetle/skyscale, only then does its mastery line become active and trainable. Until then you will receive XP towards spirit shards, as long as you're in the correct region and have maxed out all visible masteries.
---
Yeah, I think that'd be a good compromise
---
Good I mean this is old news but I've said since the layoffs if they are going to go into other games hire completely new teams. GW2 is their main money maker so it should be their main focus don't siphon of devs from GW2 to new projects because GW2 will suffer even Arenanet "whiteknight fanboys" like me can see this.
---
My best memories were on SFR as well.  our guild was recruited form NA to do nightcapping [MooN].  Learned a lot about the game mode and always had a blast.
---

First memory is that when the game came out in zerg battles half the players would crash.

Quality shitpost

Arcdps lets you remove quest/event/daily spam from the top right, at least.

Gemstore?
---
Scrapper have amazing CC with hammer 5, beltskill shread guro, soft CC condition, combo finish potebtial, etc...
---
For a casual group that would run fractal T4 with Reaper, Scourge, etc... this build could be really strong and versatile. Sure for T4 fast clear you are far from a DH but it's still viable and perform well.
---
And that response is not responding to what I'm saying, because what I'm saying is that you can't balance for higher tiers *alone*.
---
Of your you have to balance for higher tiers. But you have to balance for **all** tiers. Yet there's people who keep dismissing the feedback of lower tier players as irrelevant, when everyone in their right mind knows no feedback is irrelevant.
---
Oh my god I love this battle theme so much. I want them to bring it back!!!
---
Nah, it'll be "Gazed Abyss", part of the Gazed dye set, and will be paired with the new whitest white, "Gazed Back".
---
Probably just the person who put these up was layed off and now nobody in the studio even remembers these listings exist.

Leather farm in Lake Doric aiming straight for leather. It is not the most profitible nor the most fun, but it will give you a lot of leather.

 Wow! It is incredibly refreshing! That after 7 years, those who had to continuously hold an invisible thread talked to us ... Thank you! I am incredibly refreshed! Straight water is already dripping from me!
---
Wishful thinking. They already siphoned devs once and they might do it again. 
---
And just like JP said on twitter, they'll try to make it look like they're fully devoted to gw2 like the last time so we won't notice.

---
Comma missing.
---
How many times has this actually been posted in the last month?
---
No, I despise ArenaNet (it was a six month ban btw, not perma). They constantly fuck things up, but their corporate culture leads them to treat all negative feedback as toxic, so they don't learn from it. They make the same mistakes over and over again while refusing to acknowledge any blame. I heard many times how sorry people were about them falsely banning me, especially because I was a partner at the time, but that falls on deaf ears after you look at their history. They repeatedly fucked up ban waves, but still told people "no appeals" or "we are confident in our decision" without actually double checking until a reddit thread explained what the fuck they did wrong.
---
But that doesn't mean I'm going to hold them to unrealistic expectations. The burden of proof isn't on the players, and I never said it was. I said that what you claimed (asking people in game to throw) wasn't happening because the truth would have come out (as it has several times in the past). What I am saying is that you're asking them to ban players for something they have no proof of. If there is clear, actionable evidence of wrongdoing in game, ArenaNet should act. Expecting them to police everything *outside* of the game is unreasonable. I blamed them for letting Katsumi/Toker/Noscoc trio queue. I didn't blame them when the EU teams DDoSed. I blamed them for letting players sell leaderboard spots by account sharing. I don't blame them for not policing who is allowed to play with who and when.
---
But since I already had a PVP, PVE and WVW build then this change was a paid feature only.
---
[Season 4 episode 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Long_Live_the_Lich) is required to unlock the [roller beetle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Roller_Beetle). All of [season 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_4) is needed to unlock [skyscale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale). [Path of Fire](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire) is required for any season 4 content. Season 3 has no mounts (as it was before PoF). 
---
As for skins there are some in the black lion chests as a random unlock and you can get keys for doing story or map completion. You can also convert gold to gems and just buy the skins from the store.

WoodenPotatoes, often referred to as WP, is the biggest GW2 YouTuber. He covers all new patches and runs several different series on builds, playthroughs, or whatever he is into for the time. He also has a second channel for stream vods and PvP content every now and then. Atm, it is mostly his GW2 Master vods from twitch where is he trying to 100% the game basically.
---
WorldofEnders, often referred to as Boots, has some fun series too, though he is not as regular. Mostly him trying some fun "bad" builds. He also collabs with WP.
---
My favorite twitch streamer, besides WP, is MightyTeapot. He is not a purely GW2 streamer anymore, but he still plays/talks about the game often. Also has a podcast called TeaTime most Sundays and on his YouTube channel. He is more into raiding/hardcore/endgame stuff, but he doesn't go quite so hard on GW2 anymore. Still a fun stream to chill out in imo.
---
Several others out there, but these are my go-to favorites. YouTube generally hasn't been very big for GW2, but there are a number of streamers you can find on twitch.
---
**First memory**  
---
Seeing a massive 3 way, possibly triple map Q, near Blue keep in EBG. I was on Dragonbrand at the time ( the server I was born on, but am not on anymore ) and I think we were against like, Stormbluff Isle and Isle Of Janthir? I forget the servers but I know we were almost at bottom tier. I had been in WvW a couple times beforehand but, I don't remember anything before that moment. I just remember after seeing all that chaos, I was instantly in love. It's been about 6 years since then and a solid 80% of my time has been spent entirely in WvW.  
---
**Fondest memory**  
---
It would be _memories,_ really. I know a lot of people loathe EOTM, but I had a lot of good times commanding there. I made it a personal goal to teach people how to WvW properly to see if I could draw some people in to the real thing. I'd usually tag up when Outnumbered was active so I could explain my decisions to my group and lay out plans. Because the skill floor was so low in EOTM I was never worried about fighting groups much bigger than my own. All it took was some patience and maneuvering and groups two - three times our size were cake.  
---
**Two of my fondest memories commanding there would be;** Whittling down a guild ( [SW] Siege Warriors ) that was also with a zerg almost double our size. We pulled them beneath the map where the 3 Sentry's are and forced them down the narrow ramps. I was chat commanding to my group when to bomb, stab, heal, etc. and eventually about 15 of us overcame a solid 30. That final push was amazing.  
---
The other one was when I only had 5 people on me and we were sneaking around poking this blob of 40ish. We had an Engineer and Mesmer with us and I was getting them to pull people so we could yank them off cliffs or bomb small clusters then Stealth and escape. I saw an opportunity to put up a fight when they were all stacked up at Blue keep and told my brave 5 to believe in themselves. I had 1 person go inside on the Burning Oil while the rest of us spread out and tried to distracted chasers. We had to dip in and out of the keep a bunch of times, occasionally using cannon as well, but just the 5 of us ( only using Oil and Cannon for siege ) wiped at least 40.
---
Same here.
---
For achievement specific stuff, Dulfy covered most everything up to now. Atm, Dulfy has stepped away and I believe someone else has begun trying to fill in, but idk who. Believe they posted stuff for Halloween on Reddit, and they plan on doing all new content?
---
Mine is from a long time ago, our world was slamming in the front gates of a stronghold with what felt like the whole enemy server firing down upon them. Me and like 3 or 4 of my friends went to the rear and took out  the back doors with no one protecting it, and messaging our server that the back is open and saw everyone funnel in and cap the place
---
Took forever but we were cracking up thinking we were so slick.
---
Yeah, posting balance patch notes early is not communication, and that's essentially what they're doing. Communication is a two-sided process. Screaming the changes with their hands over their ears isn't communication, it's an announcement. And I couldn't care less about early patch notes announcements, they might as well not waste their time with it. Just do it and ignore us later. Don't pretend to value our input and then ignore us, that's so much worse.

To be honest, if you can remember and provide a bunch of the account confirming info to them in the initial recovery request (product key associated with the account, date purchased, billing address, etc.) then it can take as little as 12 hours to recover.  If you don't remember any of that or can't look any of it up then it may take a few back and forth emails.
