 Cite those sources then. I highly doubted they wanted the only real press coverage that got traction to be negative
---
---
---
It's enough for any real artist to review and think why that comment was made. I'm not here to be an art teacher, i still gave more useful feedback than anybody else in this thread. You're trying way too hard to white knight this.
---
It's good, but nothing in the game outside of WvW requires that level of cleanse.
---
It's *always* those who are loud, of course. You can't speak for people who don't say anything at all, but that never was the point.
---
There doesn't even have to be a separate tab for daily stuff.
---

---
It could just check if the heart was done and update the entries in a tab shared with other sales. 
---
There's already plenty of daily vendors that reset wihout any heart being done. PSNA, fractal keys, lucky envelope vendor, guild vendor, dragonfall, etc.
---
Pretty much. There are more productive things to do than continue arguing with him, have a good night dude.
---
So you belive that a new player are able to solo this. Yeah sure, no. 
---
I mean if you gonna argue this at least argue from a point that is possible for all and not from your pov. 
---
So again how will it hurt the game to be able to choose what you want to grind? PoF, HoT or Tyria? I find it amusing when people on reddit asking for something that do not hurt the game or the player but addit to something that you can choose from and yet people get all worked up about it and need to tell that no there should be no choices because... why not...
---
Lmao youre patting yourself on the back for doing the easiest thing there is and that is to critique. Congrats youre a douche.
---
&gt; have a good night dude.
---
Likewise!
---
Yeah, but this is exactly one of the reasons why the game is in its bad shape. People were yelling for new content and new maps. And that's why they made new maps every new story part - which eats up manhours like crazy. And then they were abandoned. It's not always right to listen to those who are loud.
---
True. Pretty sure like many, Apple dude and Apatia was the reason I seriously wanted to smack Zhaitan.
---
&gt;Heal renegade is not used much in fractals, or just doesnt work as good healwise as the heal brand so you can already take it off for that.
---
Firebrand does way more DPS than renegade as a damage/support set up be it condi or power.  Condition has a high burst with burning and f1 tome while power Firebrand is basically DH with extra utility.
---
&gt;As far as raids goes, if you have 2 healers in your raid group l, 
---
obviously 1 is a druid, the other varies, but for bosses with alot of CC like gors, kc, samarog heal renegade works really well. As far as using it on every boss, that would be ok but not the best way to go.
---
Raids don't require druid.  Both power and condition  Soulbeast can bring a spirit for minimal DPS loss, tempest can stack 10man might and fury.  Spotter isn't all that important.
---
Ren has good healing output but probably the worst application, on kalla most healing comes from lifesteal and ofc tablet with ventari which is a pain in the ass when people move around. You have good cc from staff and kalla but you will be greatly limited by energy so using cc means less heal. In raids font bother using f2 if you arent running charging mists. It will drain your energy fast.
---
In general i would only take ren heal or diviner for 10man alacrity, otherwise there are better options.
---
Wish they would stop this nonsense and just add quests with dialogue. You don't have to voice everything. They've added a few actual quests here and there and they were always well received.
---
No, no. Half answer not allowed. I didnt say "less fun". I said, the most boring content in the game.
---
bruh when you dont have dps that are tryhards sure spotter isnt important. if u are a tryhard dps u would just have all the heal classes to begin with, and if your group is full of multiclass then sure you dont need to bring a druid, otherwise you will want 1 instead of the other choices. As someone who actually has both healbrand and healrene im not speaking out of my ass when i say that the problem with heal rene in fractals is the fact that it is hard to balance your energy in between buffing, healing and CCing the boss, which is made really easy when using diviner rene instead, you can choose a healbrand or go tryhard with no heal and instead have a power fb instead, discretize &lt;3.
---
PvP is the most boring content in the game for me.  So there's that.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;I don't see logical arguments for why the stream announcement was bad
---
Because after the layoffs, and the revelations that the studios focus was very much not on GW2 in the period preceeding it, people are very concerned about the future of the game, and all they revealed is that we are getting more of the same content that served mostly as "holdover" content between major releases/expacs. Had they said that we'd be getting major expac features like elite specs throughout the season, thrown a bone to players who aren't focused on LS, or even merely stated that a expac will come post ls5, then I think the reaction would have been more positive. But right now, the only thing that appears to be coming anytime soon is more living story. Even WvW alliances - noticed that they said they'd be ready to TALK about alliances in the coming months....aka its probably minimum 6 months away and it was announced 15ish months ago.
---
Someone said that it was mentioned in the gw2 Making Of book
---
https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/lore/Angels-and-Demons#post6584332
---
Thief sure is an overpowered class in WvW. Better nerf it.
---
No statements. Thats typical of Assnet to not communicate.
---
This game is sorta weird to get into coming from other MMOs, in that most of what happens in this MMO is just a bit different. No tanks or healers in most dungeons and instanced content, right up until you get to raids is one example. Two expansions that neither raised the level cap nor introduced a new tier of gear. If you're coming from other MMOs you sort of have to forget what you've learned from them to enjoy this game...which doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. It's just a different experience. It's less linear in a lot of ways that most MMOs for example (not so much ESO I think, but most others). Particularly the leveling experience.
---
If you're on a US server, I can give you a bit of a guided tour if you like I enjoy showing new players the game.
---
*quietly feeds yet another tybalt to the undead for that sweet sweet black lion key*
---
I slightly remember that many of the "say something" abilities like Mantras and attunement swapping had the dialog removed/re-added/removed again.
---
I remember a Sylvari mesmer i had would say "agony, torment, pain!" for a Mantra and then suddenly she never said it.
---
I assume he was just one of the many Mordrem we slaughtered.
---
Are you sure you didn't apply an unlimited mining skin to a normal tool?  I have never heard of an unlimited tool disappearing from use.
---
why does it being made of bark make it not a skeleton?  also yes.
---
this sucks, why remove it instead of letting only players who want to hear it, hear it?
---
 
---
# ArenaNet, please don't add repeatable Golden Hearts EVER
---
&gt;should I get into this now, 
---
Sure, we don't bite! The game is still getting updates, and there's a lot for you to do, especially just starting out.
---
&gt; what is the overall community like
---
Generally friendly, occasionally salty. A lot of the game tries to encourage civility by doing things like giving experience for reviving people, making resource nodes accessible to everyone rather than just the first one there, and giving rewards to every who participates in dynamic events as long as the event finishes. That being said, some people here on this subreddit are frustrated, for good reason, but not for any reason that you have to worry about right now 
---
&gt;what do I need to know (lore-wise) before playing
---
5 main races, living somewhat in peace, united against the elder dragons. The game takes place about 200-250 years after the original, so if you want any more backstory I'd suggest looking at the lore of the original game. 
---
&gt; and what are some beginner tips?
---
Learn to dodge, combat is active and standing still is a good way to die
---
You cannot mess up your build permanently, by the time you get to max level you have every core skill and trait unlocked, and you can swap them out at anytime
---
Everything you can think of doing will probably get you exp. Quests (hearts and events), exploration, gathering resources, reviving people, crafting, etc.
---
Your first 5 skills are tied to your weapon type, but how each profession uses those weapons varies. A mesmer uses a greatsword as a ranged weapon for example by shooting lasers and illusions out of it, while a warrior uses a greatsword as...well, a greatsword. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what you like.
---
Actually I might've misunderstood your question, my bad.
---
Your tools shouldn't have disappeared when the update hit, at least I don't think it did, not for me. Granted it happened a long time ago so I could be wrong.
---
It's best to contact support, I'm sure you still have it somewhere in one form or another. I don't see how it could've magically disappeared, and if it did then that's a fuckup by anet.
---
why are you booing him, he's right.
---
there is no way to get obsidian shards just by spending gold. all methods require spending some kind of non-gold currency or participating in a reward track / some kind of event like silverwastes.
---
Either a bug or people found it annoying. Female Humans had idles animations removed for ages because of a bug, not sure if they fixed it.
---
He was suggesting you applied the mining tool skin to a normal gathering tool. You need to check your characters to make sure the infinite tool is not elsewhere. It's very unlikely you could have deleted the infinite tool without knowing. Use gw2efficency's search if you have an API key on there.
---
Saga 1: Charrude bandstorm
---
that’s a hot take
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attunement#Notes
---
All races have them.
---
pretty useless tho
---
it used to be possible but they reworked the guilds a few years back and now solo guilds are locked out from most of the content/features
---
Genuine question. Why don't you play a singleplayer game if you don't want to interact with others? Personally, I find they are much better designed and more compelling than GW2 for a singleplayer experience.
---
...should've kept mine unbound...
---
You can actually hit it right from that little hill before it I haven’t tested the boundary mi h yet but it’s pretty generous
---
Range reduction on Holoforge 5 finally happening. And a good change to IoL isntead of just taking on the CD. It's actually giving me hope about the balance because because those are very good changes that the community proposed.
---
U know u can rep a guild without socializing
---
amount of players needed to get everything? (not talking about raids)
---
I'm glad they canceled the removal of aegis on fb f3 5. It was a nice backup  aoe block for fractal cms, really don't see a reson for losing it, especially since I doubt that in wvw aegis means much.
---
And don't forget proper METAMORPHOSING krait. I was so upset when I found out that krait in this game only have one form.
---
people are saying in the comments that apparently this was removed.

I get that you don't want to praise the art because of your personal opinions towards it, but I really don't think the criticism was phrased well. I'm not surprised people are disagreeing with OP no matter what they say (even if it has warrant), because their first impression of them was "The perspective is awful here"
---
Also, your last sentiment goes both ways. Praising them definitely puts in their mind that they don't need to improve, but it also encourages them to keep doing it. Giving *constructive criticism* is a good thing, but if you come across as rude and arrogant, the criticism will either not be taken seriously or discourage a would-be great artist.
---
Let's incentivize 10 man groups!  Like 10-15 man squads get a higher mf bonus against players while a 50 man squad gets like -25%.  Maybe something else than mf.
---
Instead of big ass zeros maps can run 2 or 3 teams and increase combat all over.... more server stability.
---
That’s the thing though. At best everyone is neutral to the repeating hearts. They ONLY serve to create player frustration, there’s absolutrly zero percentage of people who like them.
---
Have you considered said groups have had the best results with heal FB and that's why they stick with it or are you really so pathetic as to denigrate people you would never even consider playing with over composition choice in a fucking video game
---
Additionally, my point in my original comment, and the several ones I made in response to your (/u/kbskbs) comment.
---
Up to once every 20 seconds, equipping a kit will grant 20 seconds of swiftness, letting you get 20 seconds of swiftness per 20 second cooldown. While you will likely lose a few milliseconds here and there, i have personally found this to be sufficient.
---
dont remember sierran looking like a dog...
---
Instanced sounds good. My issue with bounties was mainly the awful open world scaling that made them very frustrating/unfun with poor rewards. Also, I'm not fan of randomly generated mechanics to "add" gameplay diversity.
---
All that tells you is that everyone got way more Kiel buttons because way more people were representing her while killing aetherblades.
---
Also, that Evon is a TP manipulator.
---
He likely bought them all himself to make himself look more important.
---
No. This is a joke post, there's only 1 for sale on the TP so i'm assuming someone just bought them all out and listed 1 for 10k. A better representation of the post is the buy offer which is currently at like 55 gold.
---
Did you do the personal story? The Claw Island siege?
---
&gt;As someone who actually has both healbrand and healrene im not speaking out of my ass when i say that the problem with heal rene in fractals is the fact that it is hard to balance your energy in between buffing, healing and CCing the boss,
---
&gt; im not speaking out of my ass 
---
&gt;the problem with heal rene in fractals is the fact that it is hard to balance your energy in between buffing, healing and CCing the boss
---
Huh, how is it in any way difficult?  The rotation is easy to work around and you've plenty of time and energy to CC, buff, and heal.  The problem is the short range on the tablet and having allies just run out of range of the heal along with getting everyone in the F4, which is still easier than Chronomancer wells.
---
&gt;bruh when you dont have dps that are tryhards sure spotter isnt important. if u are a tryhard dps u would just have all the heal classes to begin with, and if your group is full of multiclass then sure you dont need to bring a druid, otherwise you will want 1 instead of the other choices.
---
At level 80, spotter is 4.76% crit chance, which is easy to get with a couple switches of gear to keep the 100POW/70FER food, or just take the 100PRE/70FER food instead.  There isn't much of a difference depending on how the group is organized for class buffs.  Good players just swap what food or gear they're using and optimize around potential group DPS instead of getting a few extra decimals on their own personal DPS.  A 2k increase across 5 people is s till better than a 3k increase across 3  people
---
You can't access the vendor until you complete it that day... Granted mostly it's used as a method to gate daily currency.... But I'd prefer those were dropped from other sources like events. ( Just make sure there is more event activity so that players have something to do )
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks!
---
Because they nerfed event drops and mining rate. It wasn't bad before they balanced it again. They *could* do to scale a few of the larger group events down more so it was easier to do with fewer players but that's doable
---
As you can see from my other comments im pretty fond of engineer. Throw me a whisper in game if you have more questions about it! In game name is aooogah
---
nice try on getting rich :&lt;
---
Can you even use portal-effects in the intro mission? Would that stall the PS because you can never return?
---
Like on a public forum?
---
Wow that's an amazing amount of not reading. I've been part of groups that do no heals, ren heals, fb heals, or even druid heals and I don't give a shit because people who have real issues to care about don't fume about what random people run as long as the bases are covered. We *know* some of those are suboptimal and because we're not obese no-lifing incels like you, we don't give a shit. We like having fast runs when we're in the mood for it but sometimes we we just want to get through it as smoothly as possibly. A concept that you are incapable of understanding, evidently. 
---
Astute observation with the emotion, I forgot we were supposed to be emotionless robots. When I see people punching down it makes me angry, dipshit. Rhetoric like yours is why gamers will always be a meme. Gamers rise up.
---
Yes, you can clearly see that way more players want to *sell* their Ellen badges -&gt; get rid of them. On the other hand there is only one player who wants to sell his Evon button. Clearly Evon &gt; Kiel.
---
I've been playing since release and I never once EVER saw anybody say this. if you want to insist this was some big push from the playerbase you'll have to provide some evidence.
---
Don't forget the hearts that are dependent on an event starting to spawn the mobs you need to complete it. I fucking hate running around waiting for some event to start just so I can even begin to do the heart, and then if there are a bunch of people the mobs get killed too fast to get much progress so you have to wait around some more. There has to be reasonable ways to do hearts even if the event isn't active.
---
"I am Forgal, son of Kern. My father was the last Dolyak Shaman! I am a Warmaster of the Vigil! You will never make me kneel!" It was an honor fighting alongside you sir!
---
But people would first need to *obtain* them and that takes effort.
---
anet trying to inflate play time but they don't understand that if you make it too grindy then people just won't play it at all.
---
Nah, I actually like them quite a bit.
---
Sure it's not the most exciting moment to moment gameplay, but it's a reliable way to farm towards a goal whenever I want. I don't have to wait for an event timer, I don't need to gather people from the LFG, I just log in and get some stuff done and I'm out. Not only that, it gives me something to do when I'm waiting around for events. It can get tedious at times but so does dynamic events once you repeat them a couple times. 
---
My only change would be to some of the PoF hearts that actually take fcking ages to complete.
---
Happened upon this when leaving Tarir post-meta and just saw a Veteran Vinetooth and a Champion Arrowhead beating eachother up, but somehow the Vinetooth was winning?
---
Was a pretty fun time to have some other watchers really confused at the whole ordeal, love how the small stupid things that happen in this game can join a few people together sometimes.
---
Anyone have any similar occurences of some fun small run-ins in the game?
---
there *is* a sink for them, they are called legendaries. more often than not people do not have an abundance of them so it's a good thing that there are not too many sinks outside of legendaries for obsidian shards.
---
A real KO would probably be two Saga updates being pure story.
---
Just as with its condition counterpart vulnerability, most offensive builds are able to supply their own might
---
The lines also gets changed for weaver as noted on the wiki page
---
The cost Magic-Warped Bundle is actually either 50s+1250 UM (if bought in Ember Bay) or 1g+500 UM (in other zones), so with the former you'll get a "profit" (i.e. convert UM to gold). The rate is much worse for UM than for VM, though.
---
Not removed since I just heard my human ele say the one for fire
---
"Eat my shorts!"
---
But none of those things have a daily unlock mechanic. They're just available again once the server reaches the next day.
---
It is a very different Technology and code. 
---
Especially since I believe it is also character bound and not account. (The daily limit)
---
Best would be to just give those map currency after completed the heart.
---
And if they really want the karma sink and can't combine the code for daily purchase and hearth. Just make a new vendor per map that sells all things those vendor sell per tab aside map currency. The tab unlocks on first completion
---
One thing I did in WvW.
---
Attack an oakheart. Pull it to a sentry/mobs, and wait for it to use Aoe.
---
Dodge the Aoe. Stealth or just run away.
---
I can imagine Canach making some bets.
---
Probably, but it's a matter of perspective.
---
You can use so many other things for storage...
---
* bank tabs
---
* bank characters
---
* bag slots
---
* shared inventory slots
---
I like to sweep in when two or more NPCs are about to kill each other and finish all of them. They do all the work, I get free stuff. 
---
Vinetooth take greatly reduced damage from anything but players, and will attack anything but other mordrem, and for some reason, mushrooms.  
---
Also weird, some mushrooms get 'enraged' like mordrem when mordrem die near them, and mordrem get enraged when you kill some of them near mordrem.   
---
Yet they are not mordrem.   
---
Along with the use of "blight" for many things related to Mordremoth, this always made me suspect that the "plant" magic of Mordremoth had been corrupted into "blight" fungus magic. Mordremoth's magic would not be the green nature magic you see in ranger skills, but the purple blight seen in his vines.  
---
Other dragons would also have their magic corrupted or imbalanced in some way, like: 
---
* Zhaitan: Death -&gt; Undeath
---
* Mordremoth: Plant -&gt; Blight
---
* Kralkatorrik: Crystal -&gt; Brand
---
And so on.
---
Does the veteran get the champion bag?
---
Can you kill the veteran to get the champion bag then?
---
If a veteran kills a hero point champion does he unlock new abilities?
---
How about having enemies level up like in Guild Wars 1 when killing players/mobs? xD
---
&gt;I just want the items for the legendary armor collection tbh. 
---
Most do. That's why ANet needs to do something to either make raids more accessible to casuals, or Envoy armor more accessible outside of raids. Buying raid runs from other players should never be the solution, that is a symptom of a broken system.
---
I don't mean to sound condescending, but are you playing in a toaster?
---
Like, my rig isn't even that good (i5 6500, GTX 1060, all stock) and even I don't have the problem you're facing. 
---
Maybe fiddle with the settings?
---
Lieutenant Kholer vs the Cave Troll
---
possibly some dungeons, i don't think any of the proper world bosses can be soloed and i'm not sure about fractals.
---
I mean **you** tried to convince **me** that I'm wrong, so **you** are the accuser. ;D
---
And you last sentence don't even make any sense, also I don't really care if you block me or not. It only confirms that you don't have any arguments or even evidences, but want to be "right" at the end of this conversation. So you tried to end it literally with the words "I'm right, you are not, because I say so". Too bad, it didn't work. ;)
---
&gt; It is a nice backup aoe block for fractal cms
---
You do know all these changes are for WvW only, right?
---
holy shit 10k gold really?
---
This has already been posted.
---
You can complete guild missions at a decent pace if you have most of them unlocked. About 2-3 can be done (the easy treks) sometimes 5 ish if your lucky that week. Though at the start it'll take more since you only have 3 missions unlocked i think and you'll go at a pace of 1-2 a week. If you time races well with other guilds you can leech of other guilds progress and players and that can net you 3/3 or 6-7 done a week once everything is unlocked (best to hop on r/guildrecruitment and scan through guild mission times there and leech :3). Though to max a guild the last time i checked you need about 12k gold to buy all the mats that are required. Probably more if your too lazy to farm for the account-bound items that are required and just buy them from people as well. It's a heavy investment but if your bored it's worth a shot.
---
A pretty easy way to get a few a day basically free are to scoop up the volatile magic in Jahai Bluffs and Thunderhead Peaks (there is a daily cap, don't know off the top of my head what it is).
---
Training discords. At the very least you'll be able to gather people who're somewhere near your skill level.
---
EU: discord.gg/nZg52r3
---
NA: https://discord.gg/2X9Mpfw
---
does that only affect your current weapons or the second set too?
---
Shadows being on at all is a big bottleneck with so much geometry going on there. But the biggest impact on your FPS would be character model limit and character model quality. 
---
If you have those two on low, shadows off, and nothing needless on like supersampling etc, and still having noticeable performance issues then its either your hardware bottlenecking, or some driver setting on your compy you're not aware of or some issue with your OS that would take some digging etc.
---
It has a coordination based pre-event and kind of sucks unless you can center strat DPS from 100-50%.  There's also the awful gliding phase that kills inexperienced players directly afterwards.  It's a headache to manage with inconsistent pugs.  The bloodstone shards have to die so that Xera isn't unmanageable a.k.a Xera &amp; Add company buffed to hell; might, fury, quickness, *retaliation*; and lots of pugs tend to greed for DPS at the expense of crucial mechanics like this.  It's a fight with a lot of moving parts that require everyone to know the mechanics, be active/aware and able to communicate well.
---
Isn't Tequatl kind of a bone dragon?
---
&gt; Below you'll find a set of changes we're looking at which is WvW-centric 
---
It's legit a pvp patch.
---
Let's not try to guess the exact architecture of their code, alright? This is somewhere between very easy and very difficult to do. Somewhere between 1 and 13 story points. I'll need a spike to go check how that code is laid out.
---
Yeah, who says this? The UI in this game is one of the better ones I've seen.
---
Yikes. Going back on aegis nerf of fb makes the balance patch pointless. Meta wont change. Scourges still gonna be needed to remove aegis so classes can do damage which means nothing changes. Super pumped to continue playing this boring meta :)
---
You're really showing that big brain of yours with immediately resorting to ad hominem.
---
&gt; especially if it's for a comment made by me,
---
I have no clue who you are and who you are has no bearing on the logic of your statement.
---
Your claim is:
---
&gt; They said an expansion is not ruled out, which means nothing. And the fact that they're doing LS5 instead of an expansion supports that claim.
---
The problem is that, as I pointed out before, they were always clear that LS5 comes out after LS4. This happened over a year ago. Now, (as in this last week) they have said that an expansion is not ruled out, which does not contradict anything they have said or done. LS5 coming out now after LS4 has no bearing on whether the thing after LS5 is LS6 or an expansion. Since ANet hasn't made a statement on what comes after LS5, there's no way to know for sure.
---
Xera is a fight where absolutely everyone in the raid has to know every single mechanic and execute them to a high degree of precision in order to succeed. Additionally, it involves a jumping/gliding puzzle, and since most people in this game never actually learn platforming because of goddamn mesmer portals at every single JP, it's a nightmare of people falling and dying constantly.
---
Too late
---
Oh, my!  
---
That's **ABSOLUTELY** how he looks in game!
---
NO WAY the Champion Arrowhead is losing?! this is rigged XD
---
You sound pretty confident, how much are you willing to bet on it?
---
Youre correct in that healrene puts out less might. This is easily corrected by the BS bringing FGJ, which has a ridiculous duration in fractals. This comes at the cost of the BS bringing might signet, which ultimately isnt that big of a DPS loss compared to the DPS gain of bringing a condi quick vs alaren.
---
Youre also correct in that it ultimately doesnt matter as both options are great and the difference is maybe 5 minutes in fractals.
---
They aren't removed, they just aren't spoken every single time you swap. It's a chance of your character saying it, and a very small chance for nearby players to hear your character say it.
---
It's also possible you have player banter (or w/e it's called) muted in the sound options.
---
It’s because Tybalt is one of the best characters in the game. The chemistry between the main character and him are great, it really feels like they are friends. The VA is great. His development is great. He’s just a great character. 
---
And then he dies. It’s a tragic heroic death. And almost instantly, he is just replaced with Trahearne. Who is the opposite of all that. It just feels like tybalt was replaced.
---
I also recommend sandbox leveling. Don't spend gold on gear until level 80; instead, peek at the renown heart vendors, who in the core game are all selling gear for karma. Also personal story rewards of course.
---
Someone might have a better answer, but searching for the image on google doesn't show any results prior to August 30. So this was likely given out by ANet to members of the press during the PAX event.
---
Kind of unrelated, but I miss using the tome of wrath on my guardian back at launch and hearing "You will know my wrath" said over and over again when you attacked with it.
---
I'm guessing this was an image gave by anet to the people making the articles but not used by the company in the promotion.
---
They are sons of svanir and icebrood. And some, I assume are good people.
---
I don't think anet ever skill split a skill in a way it lost a boon in wvw/pvp while remaining in pve or opposite. Its mostly the values that are being changed (duration of boon, amount of stacks, cd etc.). Im not sure what is their reasoning, maybe its just impossible or they don't wanna confuse players but yeah if they removed it in wvw it would be removed in pve as well and no matter how OP firebrand might be, a support tome without even one shaerable aegis would be next mistake in trying to nerf/balance a class. Guard has a lot of powerful support traits and utilities that should be looked at first before making all the tomes be: enter off cd, spam aa, drop and forget. If nerf then nerf the class and not take the tools away, thx.
---
So a fucking necro, one of the most survivable classes in the game with low dps tells himself "*bigthonk* hmmmmm f4 too easy, raid CM sounds perfect for me" good job dude. You played yourself. Do you have arc dps? Do you play t4 fractals with a healer+chrobo/firebrand+renegade? Because you very probably have been carried all your life.
---
You forgot and uses Executioner's Toy Axe in story instances!
---
Exactly this. I am definitely one of the players in the "middle ground" market, and this game has been starved for us since launch. The *closest* it has ever gotten to pleasing my demographic, was with HoT and the Metas. Also, queen's gambit was pretty good, speaking personally.
---
Thanks , couldn't have said it better myself :P
---
Also, it'd add more diversity to the gameworld if they were present.
---
$5.50 every day since 2016. :V (roughly, just assuming 4 years and not going by specific dates).
---
That's why I keyfarm only and I don't buy anything non-permanent from the gem store. @_@ The real world money-&gt;gems conversation is designed to hide how much you're actually spending.
---
you like pugging raids? I did that for a while, got a VG kill out of it. Fuckin hated the pug aspect of it, but enjoyed the fights a lot. I prefer figuring out the raids myself, but that really does require a group of friends or very patient people. But, what's more important, is that Raid training guilds exist for people. For anyone that actually care enough, the options exist. I, personally, haven't cared enough in a while. Not a slight against the game, just other interests, etc.
---
It's a good one, though. So many.. er.. memories..
---
So with this change.. it just gets confusing for me..
---
&gt; Sand Cascade: Reduce the base barrier granted by this skill by 33% in WvW &amp; PvP, increase the healing power contribution by 20%, as the healing coefficient is already pretty strong.
---
They reduce the base barrier but increase the amount given from healing power. I looked at the wiki for healing power and it's..  
---
`Total healing = source-specific base healing + Healing Power * source-specific scaling factor`
---
So by going off Sand Cascade.. the new one would be 1626 barrier + healing power * source-specific scaling factor (whatever this last one means).  I guess cele scourge meta might make a return?
---
below the surface
---
Part of my routine is soloing all HoT hero points for rares. I prefer to solo to keep my edge up and its doable with most classes with an appropriate build. You could try that.
---
&gt; **Under Water events** 
---
Hm?
---
&gt; **Under Water content in the game?** 
---
What?
---
I've just browsed all the Anet (current and former) artiststation profiles I know, and the only new GW2 art I see is from [Zhengyi Wang](https://www.artstation.com/rangerwang), who's become more and more filling the role Kekai Kotaki had (making awesome, detailed, loading screens and designing the big bads).
---
So it seems to be new GW2 art. But it also wouldn't be the first time some news articles use non-GW2 art that was made by known GW2 artists (the number of times I've seen media post [this freelance work by Kekai](http://www.kekaiart.com/uploads/5/4/7/6/5476798/6882495_orig.jpg) as Primordus artwork is very numerous indeed).
---
Pretty sure there are a few in Bloodtide as well.
---
What I'm saying is that one should never, ever, try to estimate the complexity of changing code they have never seen.
---
I happened upon this one day, and I have garbage DPS, so I planned to just wait for them to get each other low before swooping in to finish them off.
---
Bow howdy, I was there hovering for a good 20 minutes and they were still scrapping at like 50% health.
---
Hearts are very long to complete most of the time, and my biggest concern is that they take a spot of a cool event that could have been there but instead there is a stupid heart.
---
are you a sylvari?
---
Too bad, thanks
---
Thx for the reminder, was waiting for this sale :)
---
damn, I've been waiting for ages for that sale to come up, and missed it.
---
&gt; The team plans to correct this in the September 17 release. We will update if this changes. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
---
Ah zerg [Eles.You](https://Eles.You) sneez in real life and your ele gets pneumonia in game and dies few seconds later.
---
Uhm.... the fuck ?
---
Just that the loot became utter trash the last year's... In the last 2 weeks I opened 20+ BLC and got 3 ticket scraps in total and one rare skin (my only rare drop). most of the stuff is just useless trash like the locksmith bag with keys that you farm in less than 5min
---
Prot may be a bit much given how durable warrior is already but regen wouldn't be bad.
---
Then maybe change the banner trait so that each banner does a solid aoe pulse heal every couple of seconds. (Say 100 with +10-20% of healing power every 2-3 seconds per banner depending on scaling)
---
Then not only would it be better for WvW but heal war would possibly be a thing in other game modes.
---
Let me see the special tab to decide if I wanna unlock it, as well
---
If only they would go all the way with FB and make the tomes full on ranged kits but make it lose weapon swap.
---
Scroll up a lil but you can see I was corrected.
---
Eh honestly the heal on aegis trait should take the place of selfless daring with selfless daring going away.
---
Then replace the purity of body trait with something else. (say empowering might or a trait for concentration.)
---
Bam healing reduced with more choice allowed for major traits &amp; you wont have to waste dodges to heal anymore.
---
Just make one currency for entire saga (not that specific material bs), and if i don't like the map then, i can just skip it and farm the fun ones
---
If they would put the banner trait in there as a second tier major and have it lower CD's and cause each banner to pulse an AOE heal every couple seconds then it could be nice.
---
Say 100+ 10-20% of healing power every few seconds per banner.
---
Between that and shouts off heal support warrior could become a thing in multiple game modes.
---
Fastest I ever did was right on the river midway beside the fortress
---
More like Abaddon't.
---
You likely have something ticked in options. My sylvari weaver won't shut up.
---
Did you notice the part when he talked about competing entertainment as well? 
---
It’s not just a job etc, it’s that you can spend an hour waiting for raid group, or you can spend that hour watching a stream/playing some other game/doing a quick match etc
---
Which entirely removes the purpose of boon thief if you have to rely on boon extenders.
---
At that point you are already using a composition that is weaker to support the weak healing output of a thief. That makes very little sense over running stronger boon output thief variants and a proper solo healer.
---
&gt;If it was in my hands, I would even change how critical hits are calculated from a random value with precision to positioning, skills and traits.
---
Easy fix for crits would be something like 50% Critchance = Guarantees a Crit every 2 seconds ( 30 Crits Per minute )
---
You can probably find a lot of things in gw2 solo done already just type in the boss name on youtube to see if it's been done or not for example these:
---
100cm bosses
---
[Arkk solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuw3Nv5yfn0) 
---
[Skorvald solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77M_KqRznjA) 
---
[Astariiv solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ucLP4ceRsc) 
---
Raids
---
[Cairn solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E3pZ0y4dYE) 
---
[Vale Guardian solo (lmao)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8oxjD6Mke4) 
---
Gl hf.
---
Eh, whatever works for you. I like it that the window has more functionality because you can see which maps have a queue, but then again, I'm almost never in a position to play the second it opens up.
---
The skins in the BLC are random. But there is one exception, if the skins are event related, like the crimson in the lunar event or the winters something in wintersday.
---
The tempest skins i could see in the four winds event but we already had that event. So it will be random.
---
doing hearts is 99% of the time some bs kill this kill that or just collect some random garbage from the ground and give it to the npc, thats not repeatable content
---
Nah gonna disagree with you there. There's absolutely no problem with content existing that challenges players, and there's *definitely* no problem for that challenging content offering unique and meaningful rewards. Raid selling's an "inevitable conclusion" imo. I feel it goes against the spirit of raiding but the only way to fight it would be to require you to be alive to get rewards which would be a huge blow to low level raid groups. Plus, for the sellers the challenge of low-man is a much needed "repeatable, rewarding hard mode".
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
So.... An item that's only obtainable through a 1k gem purchase got disabled? Sounds like it's refund time (/s kind of)
---
[Icebrood "Saga", huh?](https://www.google.com/search?q=banner+saga&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTuT5bDY9g6_k0LMb-x5vQ_oPj38w:1567843436735&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIoPD4n77kAhUO2qwKHW96DBAQ_AUIEygC&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=754)
---
The sustain is usually controlled so you can't overheal if you don't use your heals. Higher healthpool just makes you waste more time on heals.
---
Last time I checked pvp meta, builds were using demolisher (+T) instead of marauder (+V) because they have high sustain and can easier keep themselves above 50%. The only marauder ones were squishy builds with no sustain (mostly thief and ele).
---
Anet's stuck balls-deep in their Saga. I doubt they're going to change that for you.
---
for underwater content I like to fill up the sink, then stick my head in it until I stop breathing
---
Mesmers are strong all-rounders. They're not top-of-the-line any more, but there is very little they're not better-than-average at. I've even run my chrono as a healer. 
---
In raids, chronos are almost always in short supply either as support or DPS. Mirage is upper-tier condi DPS for some bosses. 
---
In fractals, chrono+druid is the B-team for support, and they can hold their own as DPS and portal skips are still just about a thing. 
---
Open world power mirage is the ultimate farming tool because they can shoot multiple beams that travel miles and hit pretty much every enemy you can see. I've taken out champs solo with my chrono because, while they've lost their invulnerability they still have spammable blocks and a strong evade as well as very high CC. 
---
PvP has options for broken ganking one-shot power builds (their traits having far-too-good synergy is one of the reasons they've been nerfed so hard) and "make everyone hate me" condi mirage builds with a lot of mobility and a lot of defence as well as some decent bunker builds.
---
Mesmers are no longer on a tier of their own, but they're still fairly powerful as they have a lot of defensive options *and* respectable DPS. Unleash your phantasms then get into melee and fight dirty, or get out your staff and become a telespamming condi machine with ten million boons.
---
Kessexhills for blood witch is a good one
---
This place was used for the ["Blood and Madness"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blood_and_Madness) release back in 2013. The tomb you see there is where [Bloody Prince Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloody_Prince_Thorn) was sealed in.
---
I kind of agree with you, but... I'd like to say season 5 doesn't need renown hearts *at all,* much less repeatable ones. We're all attentive players at this point and we know how dynamic events work, we shouldn't need some grindy contrivance to hold us in place for five damn minutes so an event has a chance to proc nearby.
---
I'd *like* to say that, but I don't know if the devs are up to building a map that can do that *without* this crutch. Unless they do HoT-style meta events (but hopefully not for every map).
---
Also, this is definitely too late for the prologue, and probably episode 1, too.
---
How about in game poncho 1k gold, or have Evon Gnashblade wearing one ?
---
&gt;GW2's lootboxes though aren't any kind of level as the real manipulative practices out there in the world.
---
Anet greatest achievement : convincing most of their playerbase that Black Lion Chests are not _really_ lootboxes.
---
And dont come with this bullshit of gold-&gt;gem conversion. Warframe also allows you to get plat (the gem equivalent) by playing the game, and the playerbase still gave them enough shit so that they removed lootboxes.
---
At least you're living up to the aussie dream of throwing all your money away on gambling!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On a serious note, hope this is a wake up call, and you'll cut back. And if it isn't, I hope you get the help you need!
---
I would place a much stronger focus on the game and player concerns. A lot of players are concerned about the games balancing. Some players are interested in raids. Some players are very interested in the strike teams.
---
It would have been a good idea to give players a sneak peek at the content instead of word of mouth. Personally I like the idea of strike teams. I hated the GW2 raids because they destroyed what the game represented and the games balancing. Strike teams seem like a good way to handle this if they were more dependent on individual player skill than your builds. But alas, i know little else than 'its a thing'
---
same i listed one at 420g69s69c thanks to whoever bought them btw had some listed quite high lol
---
But they did. Looooooong time ago.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2018-02-06#Necromancer
---
How dare you make fun of his outfit! \*angry rubi noises\*
---
Problem is that lootboxes won’t disappear in a day and OP is struggling ***right now*** so an instant solution is better than no solution.
---
Maybe when the release actually arrives and there will be new pictures around that will be ready to be used.
---
WvW centric doesn't mean it can't have non WvW changes. Like warrior changes, which will affect all game modes, but have biggest impact in WvW.
---
Again with the countdown, noone is so hyped about LW content sadly. ;(
---
this is really bad with different attack speeds tbh
---
Ah, I don’t really do pvp all that much. I do some on my mes as I find it’s a lot easier to tank hits but I’m sure some really good ele players absolutely wreak havoc on people
---
😂😂😂
---
i like :3
---
can you make a sylvari eating char? \^,.,\^
---
Imagine to have normal quests instead of it though...
---
Check out Jim Sterling on youtube. I think you'll like him :)
---
Actually the free keys from story completion etc made me never buy a single one, because these chests always contained a cheap dye and one of these kits of disappointment. 
---
Basically waste of resources. Never got anything useful from them.
---
Just backing up this comment. Your health and well-being, both mentally and physically, are your priority. 
---
Professional support exists for these situations to help guide you.
---
Very well done ! Skyscale is great. I Really the way it's looking at us. 
---
The staff color effect is interesting too. But am I the only one to think that the right side of the drawing seems empty ?
---
I prefer farming at work. One hour is more than enough to get 400 gems.
---
he/she didn't say anything like 'BLC chest are not lootboxes' or gold to gem conversion.. who are you talking to?
---
Game mode can very realistically do much better if those player will not come back. Not saying that's for sure the case, but excessive ratio of veterans to new players can very well contribute to stale meta, circlejerking, frustration and toxicity towards "fuken neeewbz".
---
Also, it's better late than never, and bashing changes because someone somewhere is no longer interested in the game mode is just plain dumb.
---
There's no reason to be ashamed, just take it as a lesson learned and don't spend any more. If you feel you can't reliably do that, it would be best to seek professional advice, as others have said.
---
This is so triggerring its genius.
---
SIMPLY for the pleasure of watching everyone in the mistlock sanctuary and in DR banking area rocking back and forth on their spring rides on launch day
---
Nay. 
---
Trahearne spent 25 years studying Orr and Zhaitan. Leadership was thrust upon him because he was *the* expert on the matter. 
---
The PC is the Forrest Gump of violence. They are clueless outside of that role. Yet the game has always made it clear that the Commander's sword had "#1 Kicker of Asses" engraved along the side.
---
Thus I remain correct in my assessment that the players claiming Trahearne stole the spotlight remain incorrect.
---
HoT was the more brutal of the two expansions we got for sure.
---
No one cares.
---
Yeah lootboxes suck, esp on a b2p game.
---
Many dungeons, nearly all champions in the open world. A number of low tier fractals.
---
gw2 loots boxes is not to blame mate, its yourself.
---
5$ domino boxes and noodles is a huge waste, you should go to the grocery and buy yourself some healthy greens and meat and cook yourself a nice meal. $40 dollars can give you 8 dominos slice, $40 in grocery can last you a week or 2 depending on what you bought and what you made
---
Not having to refill the hearts and still be able to buy thinks like map currencies would be such a dream. Especially for that damn heart in Kourna with Rytlock as the vendor. It takes almost an hour to fill that damn thing!
---
They should put a countdown.
---
Bro, you need to eat more vegetables. Vitamins are pretty cool.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Anet is really good with the monetization strategies. Expansions are Buy2Play, so the gem shop can't be that bad as in a Free2Play games right? Is it though? Isn't it more like an entrance fee for in game purchases that rivals Free2Play games without the bad taste of F2P?
---
But there's no Pay2Win! Yeah because p2w is an outdated and failed model in the western market. Even Archage gets a new version here without p2w now because the p2w model drove players away (cosmetics stay in the shop though!) and people are excited for it.
---
But we can convert gold to gems, that's nice! Well, you don't convert you buy gems from other players that bought them with real money. Anet loses nothing here. It just gives gold a real life value in terms of how much time you need to grind it. So, if I can real life grind (work) faster for the same amount why not spend real money, right? How often do you read this on this sub? And I hate that. Weren't games supposed to be escapism from real life shit? And now you rather work overtime hours instead of playing because it's more time efficient?
---
But it's only cosmetics! No, it's top tier cosmetics in a game that revolves around cosmetic rewards at the endgame. Direct competition to in-game rewards in a ridiculous abundance. New stuff to buy every two weeks like clockwork.
---
Also, friendly reminder that you are a whale when you spend at least 100 bucks on in-game purchases, a mega-whale when you spend 1000 bucks. There's nothing wrong with being a whale when you have the disposable income, which OP didn't really have I think. But be aware of it please. Be critical with yourself and the game monetization and not a blind sheep.
---
golden hearts are hardly in the "too grindy" territory.
---
&gt; Yeah, but you aren't singled out, berated and called trash before being kicked while you have the top dps and failed a mechanic on accident.
---
As someone who commanded pug raids - I don't care so much about your DPS if you're consistently failing one or several mechanics. If it's an accident it's normally fine; any group that kicks after one fail isn't worth staying in anyway.
---
ANet seems to make Stronghold because of the concerns of people about lol or dota,  but They catched it totally wrong resulting of a game mode with no fun.
---
drinking it? is it cold?
---
Either legendaries or fulgurites. 
---
I really recommend going with Fulgurites if you dont have savings and make Jeweled Damask Patch to sell. To craft it you need Bolt of Damask, Elonian Leather and 25 Fulgurites, which are themselves crafted from Obsi and HoT mats you should have in abundance like Airship Oil. AFAIK its always profitable to sell the Jeweled Damask Patches, even if you buy the Bolt of Damask and Elonian Leather from TP.
---
That and the weeb music... Oof
---
Dunno, made my achievements not so long ago and the Q were pretty fast (3-5min max), maybe luck on my side tho.
---
Ahh there it is...poor ol' me, a makeshift reaper build going into the jungle with his pack of minions. Exploration was extremely slow, like 1st day I might have traversed only 1/3 of Verdant Brink. Dunno if I will experience that ever again xD
---
The fastest way used to be chest farming in SW. Dunno now. The berries way mentioned above seems like a good idea. Just need a lot of toons and time. The chests there also has a small chance of dropping berries.
---
I did play one match yesterday with only Conquest checked, it takes time like 5 minutes. 
---
I've played Stronghold once, didn't played it again
---
Rank 16 dont matter a shit, real rank(bronze,silver, gold... and the numeric mmr rank) is showed during seasons, for your bot problem i bet you are in silver or a new generation of poorly implemented bots have asaulted bronze div
---
They have a random chance to proc. Otherwise it would be very annoying, specially with Tempest also having lines for overloads, and Weavers changing attunement even more frequently
---
Well, you can also just make an internal counter, adding 1 per 1% critchance on hit. When it is &gt;= 100 it will subtract 100 and make the next hit a crit. Guess that does something like what the other guy would appreciate.
---
So cute :3
---
I got so angry as a zerker power necro, I went full soldier's...
---
I’m frugal so I can’t help but keep track of how much I spent. I am at ~125 over the 6 years I’ve played on off. I never bought a black lion key. Just the useful QoL on sale and some skins.
---
no no no please dont make the game worse by saying something without thinking first. Lots of people have really wrong ideas here in this thread.  
---
Hearts are way better then wow quests, go watch Angry joe review again to remind youself why. Lets not get back to  2010 mmo design. I know WoW classic is in spotlight again but please think. Hearts are a step forward in a quest department.  
---
So to people who think they ahould remove hearts and add quests, just no.   
---
To people who dont like that hearts are repeatable... WTF? You are not forced do to them. If I would say that I dont like that raids or fractals are repeatable as I only do them once what would you feel about it? What you should ask here is that heart vendor would be able to sell items all the time after first time you do the heart. Please let people who enjoy repeatable content in open world enjoy repeatable hearts.  
---
What you hearts haters really want is to make sure hearts wont take too long, and wont only have boring options in them. Anet need to make sure they have different and interesting options to complete them, and that they take resonable time to do.  
---
Hearts are good mmo design. You visit a place while exploring, you can help locals do to something, rather then boring kill 10 rats quest. You have freedom to choose what to do. Its immersive, its repeatable, its rewarding (map currency, karma).
---
  
---
Also Anet know when to add them and when to not add them. In map that are action and even focused like dragonfall they would be horrible. This is why there are no hearts there, its a meta event map. And in exploration type map like Thunderhead keep they fit just fine.  
---
Guys dont forget about bigger picture. You get angry at some hearts while farming for skyscale? Thats not a reason to say hearts are bad design. I believe they are one of the biggest improvment in mmo questing formula anet designed.
---
annoying for who? they could leave it in and just add a mute button for other players
---
Yeah, I do now. I love me vegetables.  👍
---
can you figure out what it is? I looked and didn't find anything.
---
just continue your PoF story where you left off. you will unlock most mounts on your way.
---
popular meta atm is the dragonfall meta on the last living world map.
---
ye but they keep showing up. also I got the dll yet the exe still tells me it's missing. now it's another one, tried to register that dll but that doesn't work either. 
---
Api-ms-win-crt-private-l1-1-0.dll
---
&gt; GW2's lootboxes though aren't any kind of level as the real manipulative practices out there in the world.
---
But loot boxes are the great evil and source of all the bad things in gaming. At least at the moment until gamers here on reddit find the next idiot thing to incessantly bitch and whine about.
---
I guess the positive side of it, it is/was my only vice. I don't smoke a pack a day or live off the goon bag, so you could say I was making a saving?
---
sounds like a good anime to watch XD
---
Love it
---
Look at HoT.  No hearts at all, just constant events going on all the time that give you either map currency or a key to unlock the chests that spawn after events to farm map currency.  You can also simply run around murdering everything aimlessly and amass currncy.  
---
Dragon Stand too, exactly the same thing but with map currency nodes all over the place on top of the events.  
---
The other point driving both of those, but definitely HoT far more so than DF, is that all the events going on constantly makes the map feel more alive, even if nobody's doing them.  One of LS3, PoF and LS4's biggest issues with their maps is that there is a whole lot stuff that's just standing around passively waiting to be interacted with as opposed to stuff calling out to you and creating visible movement.
---
Thanks for paying for our servers.
---
I just checked, everything is correct, yet switching for an entire minute and my character doesn't say anything. there is no chance, it was 100% removed.
---
Personally, I like the hearts. Gives you something to do in maps you’ve already completed and keeps the map somewhat populated.
---
&gt; I just checked sounds, everything is correct, yet switching for an entire minute and my character doesn't say anything. there is no chance, it was 100% removed.
---
But loot boxes are the ultimate evil that practically force players to get addicted. /s
---
ranked or unranked? theres little reason to play unranked. for ranked games queue times go from 2-3 minutes at peak time to 6-7 during more dead times.
---
&gt; I just checked sounds, everything is correct, yet switching for an entire minute and my character doesn't say anything. there is no chance of them saying anything, it was 100% removed (at least on my sylvari)
---
Aggresive monetization, abusive mechanics, shifting priorities from healthy and rewarding gameplay towards "get money to get shiny loot, or spend fuckton of a time grinding".
---
He cannot have a rating, minimum rank for ranked play is 20.
---
Ok, I wasn't sure if they had completed the run. I'm happy for them.
---
You'll never get me to raid. I don't even do Savage/extreme content on ffxiv. I tried on gw2 and it's just unfun... Some people play games to enjoy ourselves, NOT challenge myself. I have enough of challenges in real life.
---
The time commitment and organization needed is just plain unfun to me. Experienced raiders might only take a few hrs to do their weekly clears but it takes commitment to get there. Everything about raiding is just not fun to people like me. 
---
Gw2 will just have to cater to all sorts of audiences. FFXIV does a fine job putting out amazing stories and normal mode PvE for casuals while giving challenging (from what I've heard) Savage/extreme content for the better players. Though, I have to admit the amount of Savage/extreme content does not seem enough to keep raiding players subscribed indefinitely, the devs did say the game is designed for players to take a break in between updates.
---
Yea, forgot that.
---
&gt;Sorry, sometimes you need to complete a specific form of content to earn a specific reward. 
---
Maybe, but that's neither here nor there. We're talking about Envoy armor, which is in no way specific to "raids." 
---
&gt;There's plenty of other armor sets, story episodes, and beautiful environments that take absolutely zero skill or coordination to acquire.
---
True, but none of those things are fungible.
---
Auric and DS are still a Thing. 
---
The PoF metas are now way more populated - in General I more often than not find a Group running the meta of a map, even when there's Nothing on the LFG
---
I guess you could check the wiki to see if there is a pattern or regularity of them going in?
---
Well if an alcoholic admits they have a problem and they want to do something about it ppl will discourage them to go to bars because of the risk of falling into old habbits again
---
Putting it that way, I am doing a lot better than people who buy a pack of smokes a day. And I agree, the fact that I couldn't see my money being spent, made it a whole lot more easier to spend it.
---
It's hard not to beat myself up considering that money could have gone into surgery to make my quality of life better.
---
NA just has way more statics and people want to lfg raid less than in EU
---
Basically the plot of HoT
---
I checked sound option and was switching for like a minute or two. my character said nothing. so either you're lying or there is a problem with Sylvari.
---
I will never get annoyed hearing an Asura yelling "FIRE/WIND!!" - that's last avatar stuff XD
---
&gt; Yes, the source of all evil!   
---
Noone said that.  
---
&gt; Players are practically forced to buy them.   
---
Companies are hiring psychologists to make them work exactly like that - make you feel like you're forced to buy them, if not outright addict you to them.  
---
&gt; It's not like they can just not buy them.  
---
Companies do it because those few who can and will spend thousands of dollars on them make it worth it. Everyone suffers - everyday players because quality content gets shifted to gemstore, and the addicted because of their addiction and lost money (plus they literally CAN'T "just not buy them", you oaf).   
---
&gt; This is definitely the most important issue our generation is facing  
---
No one said that.  
---
&gt; deserves all the attention  
---
It doesn't and it does not get all the attention. I can be happy because of a few reasons at the same time, and in similar vein, I can be annoyed at few issues at the same time.  
---
&gt; deserves...idiotic hatred it currently gets  
---
You got this one right :)
---
Yeah, it's hard to find help living rural, but I am looking into at the moment. Cheers!
---
I guess it wasn't enough considering how bad WvW gets.
---
Set a vpn up to belgium location, they dont show up there ;)
---
Actually I like the hearts but only when there is masteries to train. It's a great source of exp for casual but fun investment (you can kill mobs, or go search carrots, or anything else...). So when I need experience for masteries I really like it, it makes me go back to the basic leveling content and for a pretty hardcore gamer like me it's perfect. The issue is that when masteries are done I never go back to doing them... Please anet I want an expansion like HoT again. It took me so much time to finish masteries playing casually, I loved it.
---
If that's true, why is there no big ass event like erp organized there? And why were there hardly any people from NA in erp? Silently chilling in own statics does not show a vital community
---
No Mushroom Queen hero point from TD or getting rekt by a belly flopping fatty frog in Tarir?  Didn't see too many rolling devil swarms or Mordrem Sniper (bow users) Mark-and-nukes either.  
---
So many ways to get absolutely demolished in that damn jungle...
---
Reposting is cool! New readers can see all the old cool posts. For example I've never seen this video before. "You can always search this video from the old posts". Eh? How new readers know what to search? Exposure!
---
Good luck! It can be hard making the first steps. But you'll feel much better once you're over that hurdle, and hopefully you get the help you need in a pace that isn't overwhelming you.
---
For some reason, gw2crafts keeps shutting down. Are there any alternatives for cheap crafting guides?
---
How do you know?!
---
That ain't Jormag 'cause I don't see any missing teeth!
---
Those were, indeed, GREAT times!
---
technically its a f2p game with b2p expansions but i agree with you
---
Damn you must be fun at parties.
---
You can get these in WoW as toys from dark moon fair, they are quite fun.  Would be neat for GW2 to get some equivalent to the fair actually.
---
One time purchases are very different from gambling purchases. And let's not pretend literally everything in the Black Lion Chests are available as one time purchases. There are exclusives. They've "alleviated" the exclusive pressure by making it so that you're guaranteed something for gambling a lot, so that gambling is less of a risk. Which just makes it worse for the kind of people who are prone to gambling. This way they have a way to justify it, because they have guaranteed return on investment, even though the investment exceeds the return by far. And half the fun for these people, myself included, is that there's a chance you get something you want in just a few keys, there's a thrill to it. And you tell yourself stupid statistical lies after your first round of 25 keys fail to give you the item you wanted, worth 2000 gems that you've now paid 2100 for, that you're pretty much certainly getting it in just a few more keys. And then when you do get it you try to downplay how many keys you've gotten, at least in my case, to not let everyone know how much you wasted. And they call you lucky, and you think you are lucky, and you keep doing it.
---
Brooding in Ice.
---
Seeing the comparison with the bar, the current solution is also not to ban all bars, but rather to help alcoholics to recover, as some people do enjoy alcohol in "healthy" quantities.
---
Shows kind of work the same way except one takes away your money and the other takes away your time. I don't see anyone complaining about Netflix.
---
I'm all for regulating lootboxes for kids but if you're a grown up man you shouldn't blame your own issues on lootboxes.
---
Very nice! I put this on my big screen and leave it on so I can watch this all day long.
---
&gt;  guild missions -&gt; guild puzzles, PvP and WvW. That's it.
---
that's.. everything except the vault?
---
all the upgrades need favor, and to get favor you need to do missions, only one of which is soloable.
---
did you just do Obsidian Sanctum a dozen times a day for a few months?
---
female... mm does it actually matter? O_o
---
Just like the Heart of Thorns Emblem Clothing Outfit. I bought the POF expansion day after announcement and it was not visible in the store. They fixed the bug now so it's ok.
---
didn't help, tho putting the Api-ms-win-crt-private-l1-1-0.dll inside the gw2 folder now just gives me an empty error XD
---
Matters because I only have a female Sylvari Elementalist that I can check haha
---
Or move to Belgium
---
Sometimes it pisses me off to be denied content because cool skins are in those chests.
---
But then I see this... and Im' glad to live here.
---
When you have addiction, some stages are very hard.. If you know its only a matter of disabling the VPN for the rush of gambling, the mind can force you in weird ways. (I am not experienced at all to comment or advice. Just what I read)
---
Those lines are from core/base Elementalist. But just in case, as an Elementalist instead of Tempest. And as bonus, Tempest shouts at the end:
---

---
oh im not sure exactly, i bought them at random
---
No. Client is the same for every player.
---
Won't happen. If anet has the slightest reason to think that some players would get something immediately upon release because they already have a pile of a currency/material with no good sink, you can be 100% sure they'll prefer either shove it along with existing sinks of an currency/material that you already have trouble getting enough to unlock everything, or more probably will create yet another currency or material. Trying to rebalance (or even just use) something rather than making currency system even more of a mess, is not on the table.
---
In addition to other reasons, when a patch goes live, you have to leave WvW, download the patch, and then try to re-join the match. At best, this interrupts your gameplay, forces you to re-gather your squad of players, and to march back to whatever location you were assaulting or defending. At worst, you're now stuck outside of WvW because the queue is full.
---
I don't play much WvW myself and I always found it a bit silly when WvWers complained about this for legitimately important hotfixes that obviously need to be prioritized over the mist war but for small fixes like this that aren't much more than minor inconveniences? I think those can wait.
---
I'm glad that the worst seems to be behind you. Taking stock of just how negative things were during such periods can be really carthartic and helpful for realising how much better things are.
---
Don't blame yourself for it. In your case, I wouldn't even blame the game, or the fast food companies. In my case I don't blame the cruxes I relied upon either because in their absence it would have been something else and it could have been far more destructive than money badly spent.
---
Mental health issues are so easily downplayed and ridiculed in our society and the main blame should be on wider societal problems and provision of reasonable health care.
---
I am really glad to hear that you seem to be doing better and I hope that continues. Keep on the medication, CBT or anything else you are doing!
---
Another serious question, wtf happen to the Dredge? Weren't they the ones who dug so much that they were about to weaken the planets crust and sink all of the overworld?  Sorrow's Embrace portrayed that the dredge were quite the danger since they found old dwarven mines and equipment.
---
We already have a library in the ls4ep4 personal instance, they just need to allow other books in it.
---
keybinds are account-wide and stored on the server. without more context what you are describing seems rather unlikely.
---
How about you actually read them instead of storing them in places...
---
Are you sure they chose their own forms? I thought the Pale Tree formed them from the only templates she had at hand, which were human skeletons, because she's a blighting tree planted in a human cemetery. The whole race is plant-y reiterations of Ronan and his family.
---
Please do. The world would have no nothing of value.
---
&gt; Only conquest, and even when that happens, sometimes it feels like I'm getting matched with bots (they run into a wall repeatedly or something). 
---
You are playing with bots :)
---
A lot of those are personal opinions to be honest. One material storage upgrade was enough for me, but I have friends who have more of those. I dont see value in unbreakable gathering tools since I dont gather that often and I dont mind buying the ones from merchant.
---
The only thing I find mandatory is copper fed because salvaging is something you do very often no matter what you play. 
---
Earning gold can be easy in game, but the easiest and fastest way to get gold is with money, especially if you want all convenience items ASAP.
---
It all depends what YOU need at the end of the day.
---
I don’t disagree with that.  I only disagree with people using that as a license to be rude.
---
I did not say you are relying on boon extender. Boon extenders merely create margins for errors.
---
Boon thief alone does in fact have a minor weakness in that it cannot fully do EVERY might stack as well since Detonate will only get you to 20 stacks consistently; with trickery you can only get 4 other people with Thrill of the Crime to maximum might. However as far as the other important boon of Quickness being applied, with 100% boon duration, with Acrobatics and Deadly Arts' Improvisation, you can maintain quickness and the might with 0 margin for error.
---
Wait, will it be the whole season or just one chapter?
---
Used to do this a lot in Guild Wars 1. 
---
Made Hard Mode vanquishing easier 🤓🐲🐉
---
All 3 scholar professions have their strengths... 
---
For open world or any form of PvP necro is really top tier,  even in high end pve while not the highest dps in single target, both reaper or scourge are more than viable, even meta. Charr or sylvari necros are also really high contenders in fashion wars IMO. This would be my first recommendation for you.
---
Elementalist is really high power dps, both single target or air festival, or also support class.. and just got a condi bursty spec not long ago. Elems have low hp and heavily rely on skills and dodges to keep themselves up, also be prepared to master thrillion skills and builds. As I'm not a big fan of PvP, not really sure about their PvP performance these days though, they used to play bunker or auranancer, but maybe not the most straight forward class in that area. I love asura for fashion, but any race fits Elem theme good enough.
---
I think mesmer is really a special profession, people love it or hate it. It excels at every aspect of the game, definitely has a build and a trick for every occasion. Really fun to play, my main profession many years, but maybe I wouldn't recommend as the first scholar.
---
u really are genuine scum
---
&gt; I don't see anyone complaining about Netflix.
---
Netflix is a subscription service, why would people complain about netflix?
---
BLC keys rely entirely on people like OP who can't stop themselves. That's why they exist.
---
Back to the golem with you~
---
Its the internet, no one has to be nice to you.
---
You really should seek professional. Ppl here would offer advice but most often than not, they are not giving the right advice for you. 
---
Gambling is a real issue for alot of ppl. It is not a thing to be light headed about! 
---
I wish you well and goodluck!
---
I hope so too, I atm store them on a char I don't use.

couldn't find this on youtube, can you record this and link me?

In regular fractals maybe. In CM modes, you do want a stronger healer than chrono.
---
10 gold on champ Arrowhead winning!
---
No, it works fine now.
---
What if they did read them and just want to keep them because they are a completionist/collector?
---
Anet has a history of retrospectively added things That affect past items that has encouraged this behavior of holding on to something “just in case”.  From a player perspective, the books are an obvious thing to hold on to.
---
Anet, pls.
---
Not if it is, you know, *fun to do*.  This is why video games exist, not because we needed busywork and timesinks.
---
Rewards don't turn busywork into fun.  They replace the reward of "having fun" with different, easily created and manipulated rewards and "excitement" moments.  They're fabricated to drive players because designing for fun requires devs to do harder, smarter work.
---
People have been forgetting that fun was supposed to be the reward for playing and instead argue from the standpoint that fun means receiving rewards.
---
Home instance library would be really nice
---
Hello guys.
---
I just cleaned my disks an have around 60Gb free space on C drive (which is SSD) I would like to put GW2 in there, removing it from disk D. Should i just cut paste it to program files or is there a specific change installation folder process?
---
You're pretty much victim blaming.
---
Such compassion and the comments gets upvoted, such a great community.
---
I dont think so. I didn't like pof and ever since then the game has just gotten worse.
---
Well, I keep them because I like to read about the lore from in game sources, like those books. I still read them from time to time.
---
Why are you telling us this
---
99cm first boss is a great solo challenge
---
If your that dedicated to remove loot boxes from your account. VPN to Belgium
---
Gambling is an addiction, casinos aren't to blame, the gamblers have a problem.
---
Just to see if anyone else has had this issue and what happened? Because this is generally a helpful community? Why do you feel the need to ask that question?
---
They're too grindy for their reward, or lack thereof.
---
Its anets fault that they put gambling in the game with a proper ratings. Its Anets fault that they surround the gambling with predatory mechanics which aim to entice gambling addicts to buy their loot boxes.
---
I used to drop 10-20 bucks on keys in TF2 way back when. I never let it get past 200-300 bucks. I will be super glad when the loot box ideology is removed from gaming and devs actually get back into making content into their game that is not required to be bought.
---
Fair enough.
---
Although raids are not as strict as you suggest "X DPS with precisely Y build" and people are always welcome to make their own groups with whatever builds they want, so this isn't really a valid point/criticism. Raids are a good fit, because they are what they intended dungeons to be at launch "Challenging group content for organised groups of players". You are misunderstanding "we don't want class roles", they meant hard locked roles with a "hard trinity" in order to beat the content, which is not the case for GW2 as you can in fact beat raids with many different builds and don't require dedicated anything, e.g. everyone could run hybrid self healing builds. This is a "soft trinity" Anet have mentioned with "Damage, Support, Control" and each class can do a bit of each or specialise. The game was never intended to be a super casual story/open world game, at least from early development up to HoT, the combat/skill system was made for competitive PvP AFAIK. I do agree 10 man does deviate from original design, but gw1 had larger party content so it kinda makes sense.
---
Also, as a GW1 player, I'm surprised you're not interested in instanced, organised challenging content that requires specific roles and coordination.
---
I would play a traditional MMO, unfortunately none are as good as GW2 in many aspects. GW2 has the best combat/skill system imo, has fun classes, great competitive potential with PvP/WvW, really good/fun encounters, good ideas with horizontal progression (unlocking new skills, masteries, builds etc.), no gear progression and invalidation of old content (my biggest issue with other games), and a company history of challenging and skillful content that also respects your time. I also find the story ok for an MMO, the world/environments are great, world bosses/Metas are fantastic.
---
I'm just disappointing this game with great potential has been hijacked from it's original designs, to mostly appeal to a very specific part of the playerbase.
---
I haven't had any issues. Have you talked to your bank?
---
Just copy-paste and eventually do a game repair if necessary.
---
Its fixxed!
---
Thanks GW2 For being so quick!!!
---
Got a new one in my mail! :D
---
Yeah, where is people getting this idea from? No one ever asked for repeatable hearts before they were first introduced on Ember Bay.
---
They shouldn't have removed the classic quest system from the game.
---
Imagine repeatable quests with triggers for dynamic events, different outcomes depending on performance and player decisions, etc. Nowadays it's just waiting for events to spawn, with barely any player interaction.
---
In depends tool, you can see tree of DLLs used by gw2-64.exe. Dll that have red entry in its tree leafs - faulty. 
---
p.s. Gw2.exe or Gw2-64.exe? -_-
---
But then how will they get people to buy more bank tabs?
---
&gt;Repeatable content keeps players playing.
---
"Repeatability" isn't just playing things again, it's things having value at being replayed.
---
Pointless replayability with no purpose whatsoever doesn't help, and I'd wager it can actually make things worse.
---
That would make a fantastic chair! :D
---
What's the bug anyway?
---
Guild wars 1 hard mode got me started on doing this and I haven't stopped since in every mmo I play lol. Perfect time to go make food while still progressing in a story quest
---
nope. I thought that at first, but I have to go into my gw2 settings and set them all again :(
---
&gt; Canthan hackers to manipulate the election. 
---
I thought they were norn hackers? Or asura bots?
---
But u can play how you want... u are just incentivizing not zerging
---
Norn with horns - sick!
---
Firebrand and renegade are often used as support/hybrids in fractals as well as raids. Druid is pretty mandatory healer in raids because of 10 man buffs and heals.
---
Make sure to have at least one full dps build for open world because playing a support or full healer there is very counterproductive while you're solo. Check snowcrows (raids), discretize (fractals) and metabattle (general) websites for builds and tips on classes and encounters.
---
&gt; And somehow managed to make it all Scarlett’s fault. 
---
Imagine getting Abaddon and have Scarlet be behind it as well.
---
We dodged a bullet.

I think you took offense to an option being provided by M1LLSTA... sure if they turn on the VPN, they could just turn it off to get a lootbox... but that being said, if ANET hasn't done anything about it at this point, do you think they'll budge for "just one more person"?
---
You're not going to get much in the way of legislation to do anything... the only way you're going to force a company to remove lootboxes and offer skins/mounts/etc as direct purchases is for us to either stop buying in real cash or stop playing the game entirely.  The first one is going to be easier to accomplish, however probably unrealistic as well to get that many to join in.  I for one don't buy anything that doesn't tell me what I'm getting... however many, MANY others do.
---
ah the good ol' days
---
GW2 turned me off microtransactions. Now I just can't enjoy games with them.
---
Not really, i dont live in a weird fantasyland where i expect random strangers to be nice and respect my feelings
---
Since it doesn't seem to be effecting anyone else, you may want to try submitting a ticket to support. You could also leave us with a ton more information in your OP so that maybe someone can help you out easier. (OS, keyboard model, any third party installations, steps you have taken to correct the issue, etc)
---
As I mentioned, you would be able to send ArenaNet certification that you are financially okay to spend more than the $100.00 limit and then your account would be unrestricted. However, should your name come up on a problem gambling list or some kind of financial hardship the restriction would stay in place.
---
I just store them on a bank character
---
1 less aegis won't change the meta
---
Form previous posts, it seem Anet lock the ability to purchase via the store for security and contacting support would unlock it for you.
---
Changing 5 to 3 won't change anything. Running 20-30 scourges will keep being the thing to do and you won't notice any difference whatsoever.
---
Have you worked through the side stories and the Requiem/Elegy and Stellar/Astral collections? There is some good story content hidden away in there.
---
It’s just really odd because I literally had just bought gems on my wife’s account and had absolutely no issues.
---
This is a staff I designed for a Sylvari Incrementalist with heavy grounding in the Norn culture. I've never designed/drawn weaponry before so I had a good time!

Thanks! :}
---
Ah, was wondering if people had the same issue for a while now. My keybinds also reset (no usage of addons as of now). It seemed that they were resetted when another mount was going to be added to the game. So I had it with roller beetle, warclaw and skyscale. Just before they were added (2 weeks or so). Otherwise, no issues. I use crtl+ the least used keys on an mmo-mouse. (I should set up that mmo mouse once for those I guess, haven't toggled with it's own software).
---
Sure, why not? 
---

---
Another option would to be checking with your bank/PayPal/etc to see if they can block your payment methods with specific vendors. I had to do this on a card after my young kid tried making orders on one of my cards in An online game and the bank was pretty cool with it. There would certainly be workarounds for you but the additional steps could help as studies have shown the more steps involved in a process the better the chance for willpower to kick in. ie for a new expansion you pick up a one time use Visa Giftcard in the amount you need to buy the game. Essentially forces you to go to the store every time so you “feel” the monetary exchange more keenly.
---
I think 75% of my deaths in the game are from HoT content, but I think it helped me learn Ele better. 
---
My second playthrough on Necro seemed much more chill in comparison.
---
Good tip! I guess I'll stop deleting them in frustration now.
---
What, exactly, would "themed like raids" be? Mistforged Triumphant doesn't "look like WvW" after all. Raids don't have a unified aesthetic. Wing 1 through 3 are the Forsaken Thicket, but Wing 4 is a deep prison, Wing 5 is the GW1 Underworld, Wing 6 is inside the Mystic Forge (some of the most beautiful settings in the game, by the way), and Wing 7 is inside a Djinn city.
---
I have seen Pocket Raptors down entire Vinetooths... Vineteeth... Tooth or Teeth? Anyways, the Vinetooth might kill a raptor or two, but in the end those little shits always overwhelm the beasts. Once I saw the entire pack being wiped out except one, and it still killed he Vinetooth with 49% health remaining.
---
Most likely,
---
Using different cards on one account or one card on more than one account could also may raise a flag too.  
---
From experience, my guess most accounts are locked by default, and you only need to contact support once for them to activate it, and again support are very helpful and understanding.
---
I havent, I guess I'll try to do that while I wait for the next season, thanks
---
Thank you for the help as well. I’m just hoping they are able to honor the sale price on LS4 as well. I had only missed two episodes so with the sale it was only going to be 256 gems.
---
Come now, lets not bully people. We're better than that.
---
&lt;3
---
I still have the Gift From Scarlet, in the mail of my original character; I want to open it so bad, but know it will forever be lost if I do. But yes, I have a decent portion of one of my bank tabs full of this stuff and another dedicated to all the Black Lion items I refuse to delete, despite likely never needing to use them.
---
holy shit that's so bad ass...
---
that's a melee class of some kind right? not a mesmer or whatever mage
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I just never realised how bad it was until today when I lined up all these documents in front of me.
---
It's not your fault, and you did great there. I can not imagine how hard that must have been and how it felt.
---
Was going through some shitty years myself and damn, closing your eyes and not wanting to look at the problem... that is so hard to overcome.
---
15000 skirmish tickets, because I don't know what else to do with them.
---
It's been a while since I last played, last played in 2014 seriously. Sure we had black Lion chests then too (lot ls of free keys to be found through Play though back turn), but I never remember anything super interesting that caught my attention.
---
Most of it just seemed to be some cosmetics, potions and exp buffs. Oh and some free teleports. Have they added a lot to make it worth getting the keys now beyond just supporting the game?
---
Back when I did play I think I spent around 1k in a year, maybe more. But that was between buying copies for friends and getting dyes, bank slots, bag slots and some other stuff like the gatherable stuff that looked cool.
---
They always change it as the new content arrives.
---
But then it all gets ruined when Seiran returns in Mordremoth's mindscape and if you're playing a a sylvari they'll go ahead and call her 'sister', ugh. Killed my damn head canon.
---
Most likely they would, again from experience the support are very helpful, just make sure you provide them with all information required and let them know about what you were trying to get and I’m sure they will help. On a side note , the sale is always in rotation, it will be back soon on sale again for sure.
---
Wish you all the best and hope you get it as it’s load of fun.
---
Once legislation changes and these things are finally classified as gambling (eg. UK gambling commission would like to have the law adjusted so it would fall under gambling, only reason it isn't right now is because the reward isn't money) it would be a 21+ rating in quite a few EU countries. And that rating, unlike the "self ratings" by the industry (PEGI, ESRB, etc) won't be an advisory one...
---
Just like letting minors gamble in casinos is a pretty hefty crime so would be selling games with gambling mechanics to minors. No wonder they're fighting it as hard as they do.
---
On that note, I would like to add that having the BLC in game, and the response of Anet when studies of the negative effects of lootboxes started to make the rounds does say a lot about the company and their ethical compass. 
---
Especially since they promised a "solution" to the problem over a year ago, but since most countries have been rather slow to either adjust, or enforce their gambling laws Anet has just let things linger so they can exploit people like the OP for the longest time possible while just adding a "Not available in your country" notification for Belgium.
---
Do I get a HoT outfit as well if I have the dlc already or is it just for new buyers or is it even an outfit you have to buy extra?
---
Sylvaris are Lannisters. Confirmed.
---
Nobody knows yet. The next story content chunk is in ten days, so it's possible we'll find out then.
---
There's a difference between respect and not being an ass.  I'm not sure what's hard to understand about that.  I don't expect random people I've never met to not be an ass to me.  That doesn't mean that they have to be an ass to me.  That's my point.  It's not entitlement to respect.  Not sure if there's a simpler way to explain it.
---
I did. Everything changed once I started playing other professions more often for the story rewards, making me notice how bad elementalist actually was.
---
Too much effort and not enough reward, specially when other professions perform even better by just bashing your head against the keyboard. Elite specializations were the nail in the coffin for a lot of ele mains.
---
Looks great 1k gems.
---
Definitely no offense taken. My point is that the "solution" of a vpn to belgium is a bandaid at best. And depending where you live, you might as well not play at all (oceania players for example).
---
I strongly disagree about your second statement. "just dont buy lootboxes" and "just boycott the game" achieve nothing unless an overwhelming majority of the playerbase takes action for more than 2 days. Outrage is temporary and there is a majority of players that dont come to this sub or see an issue with lootboxes. Anet can very easily weather this and go back to business as usual. Better even : they can label any criticism as personal attacks. Anet may have made my two favorite games but they are not above shady practices.
---
Legislation, while painfully slow and sometimes badly implemented, is likely to curb the problem of gambling in video games.
---
I had issues with a previous game when I was a teen, i didnt work, I didnt understand what money meant. It stood with me until my young adult years even when i worked... until I realized I had developed a problem. I just stopped because I wouldnt get anything good from the damn boxes. When I played gw2 it was the same, I tried opening a few boxes, not worth it. Then they "fixed" them by adding things I wanted, but they were so rare, I didnt bother. Then they "fixed" them again, now by adding BLC exclusives!!! That really fucked me, because now I have the urge to spend money on keys to get something I want only obtainable through BLC. I really wish they added it to both at least. Put it on the gem store and make it an uncommon drop. I am not longer interested in buying for a chance at an item, I want to buy what I want. I dont go to the grocery store and slap a button hoping to get eggs, so I will no longer buy loot boxes. Today, I have to make a stand. This year, I spent more on keys because of these exclusives. I just have to deal with not getting them, no matter how cool.
---
Loved Forgal during the quests where you're looking for allies.
---
Forgal - *So, as the mighty Vigil, who shall we seek as allies for the war?*
---
Player - *The Skritt!*
---
Forgal - *\*facepalm\**
---
Escort has also been solod ( https://youtu.be/sJBREZc8nQ8 )
---
This is genious idea! Chairs that looks like attraction for children :D
---
I prefered the HoT maps too but too many people complained about "on rails" events so i doubt they will try that again, it's got to be casual friendly where people can play on their on schedule (apparently).
---
warframe hotfixes all the time.
---
It's the HoT warrior elite spec.
---
It's funny how Arenanet makes itself seem like they care so much about the consumer yet heavily rely on these predatory sales tactics feeding on our human side and nature.
---
'Lore crafting ' as crafting profession to go with it? 🤔
---
Looks like Anet is trying to fix Impact Savant to work with condi scrappers now. 
---
[I posted a thread asking for this a month ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cet18c/the_rework_destroyed_scrapper_build_diversity_but/) Although I'm sure I'm not the only one who made the suggestion. It is really nice to see Anet take that feedback onboard and actually try to make the change.
---
Thanks Anet!
---
you have a few hours before you are forced to log out though.
---
It’s also one of the worse and it’s probably one the things that has gotten the least updates. The only one I know about is when they closed the gap between off hand and main hand weapons, besides the addition of new mount and novelty buttons
---
They do, for the PoF ones. I deleted them all and I can buy them back for 1 gold.
---
No.
---
I feel like a filthy peasant
---
this whole mess could be easily solved if you showed a log of the encounter where you were "booted" out and pm'd afterwards...i am no expert but i am sure some ppl would either see your point (as in: it was not "right" to kick you) or can tell you what went wrong?
---
Dude if you cant handle people being a dick to you when it happens, just turn the computer off. Otherwise continue on with your life. Its that simple
---
A magic stick no less!
---
Scrapper will still be perfectly viable with the proposed changes, it just won't be as offensively good as it is right now. The changes aren't enough to change the meta you're right but nerfing anti toxin and by proxy current scrapper as well as stab on guards and corrupts and sustain on necro are good changes that push the balance of the game mode in the right direction. Lets just hope they don't do a 180 on these changes and instead continue to make meaningful adjustments.
---
2k gems come on Anet sponsor me
---
Let me add a /s
---
;)
---
Guild Wars 2 is a predatory game. Everything about this game is designed to get people to spend just a little more. Do yourself a favor and quit, otherwise you are just the whale that ArenaNET is laughing about milking dry.
---
The whole point is that she's growing.
---
Wait did I miss the memo and there's something useful to do with karma now?
---
true but too late to fix it
---
The equivalent here is like going to all the bartenders and saying "hey no matter how much I want to buy beer, don't let me".
---
Or, you know, there could be a "collection" for readable items...
---
Hey bud , its all your fault you cant control your impulse and say no.
---
Would make the most sense to be a scribe thing imo
---
What were you hoping to get, that would've made them worth the money?
---
The best way would be to buy them and store them until they're not available for quite some time. Which brings the prices up. Though I don't do it, because it takes too long imo. I just go with gw2 efficiency buy weapons for tickets where it's most efficient.
---
Oh bizarre :( Good luck figuring it out!
---
If you are looking for challenging/rewarding solo content in an MMO, GW2 sort of fails at it. There is some challenging solo-able content, but not as much as one would hope. Not to mention that pretty much none of them have a halfway decent reward for doing so. GW1 was way better with allowing for solo-able content, I used to solo run lots of different dungeons on hard mode and selling the other spots to others. It wasn't just fun and challenging, but there was a good ingame reward tied to anyone who had the patience to learn how to do it.  
---
I don't know if there is anything left of the vibrant solo running communities on GW1. GW2 has had some good solo content on occasion but it typically gets nerfed really fast.
---
They need to polish them if they want mini seasons and non-conquest seasons to be a thing.
---
I dont think it was trahearne as a character that was the issue, I think it was the AI during the personal story that made him an issue. He was slow and constantly talked about battles but he was useless during them. So people felt like he was taking credit for stuff he didn't do.
---
Fingers crossed for Death Magic.
---
I gave up on this tbh.
---
They could start by *allowing* us to buy more...
---
They did right direction the first few months after PoF. Keep in mind FB and scourge were still broken at that point. And frankly, SYG and scepter 3 are both still better than at this point. And shade is still busted.
---
They finally figured out the direction and but still move at a pace so slow alliances will come out before we get a new WvW meta.
---
Mesmers are great for group support, and has some nice bursts. Good in pvp
---
Eles are squishy ,but are great in open world, various combo fields, heals, loads of aoes for mass tagging mobs during events, meteor shower, tho nerfed a bit, still feels amazing to cast. Not so good in pvp, but has its bursty place. Also a nice fractal healer.
---
Necros are easy mode. One can go full dire tank/ condi dmg, with a minion army and solo everything. Reapers can stack quickness and might and slash everything, scourges can do good condi dmg as well as be a good support/healer, even in raids.
---
They are tough in pvp.
---
Regarding your looks, there are some nice armor pieces for males as well. What i usually do is stand naked infront of the bank wardrobe, try out all pants, all body pieces... save the favorite ones and try to mix and match them till i found a perfect armor set.
---
My ele for example has kodan boots, carapace pants, whispers body, kodan gloves.
---
Dyed dark cyan, gold, deep red, it looks like a battle mage with, a scarf over his back rather than a wizard wearing robes.
---
Shoulders are hidden, sometimes less is more.
---
Personally, i enjoy ele for a challenge, and versatility. Meteor shower just never feels old, and tagging all the mobs means more loot.
---
Necro is fun when i go full tank/condi minion mancer and i solo hard champions.
---
As for mesmers, i could never get into them.
---
Depends on what you consider useful, but ever since season 3 there has regularly been stuff added to buy for karma: skins, tonics, combat tonics, minis, gagets, map currency.
---
id assume malice if they hadnt made so many qol changes when it comes to storage, including the huge change of making all item drops unidentified.
---
I think the easiest way is to type "/wiki " then shift click the item. I recommend at least throwing stuff in you inventory then checking the "sell items" tab in the trading post to see if anything is worth selling.
---
That's a minimum of 2 hours a day. I used to be that active.
---
Now I no longer do the meta farms nor fractals or raids.
---
I'm fine with it if the content is fun. I think the way in which hearts are completed is something they could dramatically improved. Picking up an item and returning it to an NPC or passively grinding mobs until the bar fills is boring as hell.
---
If hearts are going to be designed as daily activities, make them more engaging, it'd also be nice if they are better at telling the story of the world.
---
i opened like maybe 50 bl chest in 7 years.  
---
there is actually nothing of value inside.  
---
you win nothing and you lose everything.  
---
so no dont buy keys but get the freebies.
---
https://youtu.be/7S-DGTBZU14 Watch this video. You're not alone and there's nothing wrong with you. Something is wrong with Anet and AAA game industry. In fact send this video to Anet management explaining your situation as well. In fact let's all send them this. Show them that we know what they're doing.
---
I’d say restart! I was in the same boat and I tried starting where I left off, which was around where you left off. I just couldn’t get back into it for some reason. I didn’t feel immersed or anything. Made a new character, leveling from 1-80 and I’m fully back into the game.
---
Oh look it's that ranger main that's upset they get kicked from WvW groups; yet can't actually play unless carried by a group. 
---
I agree, 10% WvW vets in the gamemode is too much. It's clearly them preventing you from making your own groups when half the maps in the game aren't played at all. Removing them will suddenly change the meta.
---
Most likely a literal budget version to indicate that she is something new and they didn't had time/interest in giving her an actual new model.
---
Knowing Anet, this may be a one time use for the marketing only - and won't see light of the day again :(
---
After you put some clothes on
---
They should also tease the new elite better through the characters to build the hype or make a whole storyline event to unlock the elite (for PvE). 
---
Marjorie reaper and Braham dragonhunter didn't showcase anything.
---
Mine is watching NPCs try to get within melee range only to run past each other repeatedly
---
As an emote, yes.
---
As an idle, no thank you.
---
yes things are stronger now compared to launch pof but there's no point bashing anet about it at this point tbh that moment has long passed, just be glad that they're making the right changes for now and continue to make criticism and suggest good changes that they may consider. Nerfing scrapper is still pretty huge and significant as far as the meta goes tbh and i'm glad that they did it the right way by addressing antitoxin runes instead of pulling a chrono on us and nerfing everything but the problem until the class is so unfun to play that no one wants to play it. feelschronoman
---
so the necessary stuff for noobcarrying. 
---
Okay now i understand why pugs prefer it even if it is the suboptimal comp.
---
I found a way down the surface at the northeast to 20th blood cohort on hero's canton, then i crossed swimming towards the academy, reaching a rock near Nolani Haunted and made my way up to the very corner of the map (northwest) with my skyscale, and noclipping the floor there with the "Bond of faith" skill, then just gliding down to that place. It took me some time to reach it, but it's worth it for the selfies haha
---
Do incrementalists count really high?
---
If you're spending that kind of money and not feeding yourself, lootboxes aren't the problem, you are....
---
Must have skipped it somewhere. Whoops.
---
This is the reason why I stopped playing GW2 literally, I no more have space on my chars to loot items.
---
I'm sorry that a lot of people here lack basic empathy just because they don't face a similar problem. "Just don't" or "It's your own fault" are clearly the words of people who know nothing.
---
Impulse control as a symptom of depression or other mental illness can be devastating especially with how often it causes financial issues. And it's so much easier to fall for when it's entirely intangibles, because there is no "just use cash to see how much you're spending" option online. Then add in the gambling, which is meant to trick people into spending more, and that's just...so rough.
---
I think the best option would honestly be to stop playing gw2. But I understand that might not actually be a good solution, because a game like gw2 might actually be giving you stability or a routine. And unfortunately just about any replacement game would be even worse than what anet does.
---
Hopefully they can disable something for you, but if not, do you have friends that play? Support systems are so helpful for stuff like this and it would help to have some people in game you can talk to instead. I know there's some really supportive guilds out there.
---
Most WvW complaints are due to patches during reset when queues used to get up to 1hr to get in map. Releasing the patch 1 hr earlier before  reset or later after the queues subside and people can get some play time in would be polite.
---
It's easy to see why random gem store fix 30 minutes after reset and everyone in guilds prepared for reset have to queue again and the 50 people in the group are stuck in queue for the night instead of playing the game is complained about. 
---
Nowadays this is less severe as queues are shorter
---
I usually don't like art on this sub but this is by far the best GW2 art I've ever seen. You should work for Anet tbh.
---
Using LaunchBuddy should solve this.
---
Banking alts are all the rage
---
It depends on how many episodes you've already unlocked.
---
At this point they should probably water down the mechanics and rework it into a conquest map. But there's that whole champion or whatever reward system that is keeping the mode anchored in the game.
---
It depends on what episodes you already have unlocked. The season packs only include episodes you haven't unlocked. The less episodes are included the lower the price and the bigger the discount. 
---
For example, at my alt account I had every LS3 episode unlocked except for episode 1. That's why the LS3 pack included only episode 1 for me, cost 104 gems and showed me 98% discount.
---
you probably have different amounts of the episodes unlocked already
---
It's because one of you has an episode unlocked already, so it doesn't charge you for that episode, which changes the math.
---
I would love to see changes for scourge that discourage mashing all your shade skills all at once for a spike. Something that would make that an anti-synergy. Basically make scourge slower sustained or ramping area denial instead of sudden condi explosion.
---
Stay strong brother 😕
---
I've solo'd the Thaumanova Reactor fractal at fractal level 64 when I was couldn't find a group and was really bored. It wasn't that difficult, it just required patience, which I think is the most important part of wanting to solo any content.
---
The merch dude should be the new rival for Evon Gnashblade

Maybe he is a giant shark and has spare teeth.

Nope, dead game.

Why...I swear this community has fucking Stockholm’s syndrome with Anet’s braindead decisions.
---
&gt;Will the repair function wipe settings on my account?

no
---
Honestly, I'm glad I saw your comment. The circlejerk is strong in here.
---
It's like complaining that McDonald's made you fat. Should we ban all unhealthy foods?
---
What about shopping addiction? Are the shops at fault? Should we put a spending cap on everyone?
---
What about alcoholics? Should we vilify beer and cider companies? Should we bring back prohibition?
---
Seems like people are happy to jump on a bandwagon when they like the rhetoric but ignore the actual issues.
---
Man it's so much more than just the books IMO. I have so many of those level up thomes and dozens of little unique items/consumables that I will likely never use. Then there's my halfway done mawdrey that takes up like 4 slots. I wish I could clean up my inventory more.
---
Would you guys bet on who wins?
---
I mean for this kind of thing I'd buy a character slot instead. These are items you really don't need access to regularly and on different characters. But I guess some of it is soulbound potentially.
---
How many years of practice did it take you to learn this shading technique?
---
There is an expantion coming assuming 1 thing and 1 thing only- that gw2 has anets full focus behind it. Does it? Idk
---
good for us that law makers have no idea about the games they pass laws on, or ecto gambling and unidentified loot bags would have been removed long ago.
---
I've been gone for a while and don't quite get the new runes/sigils system.  If I'm looking for drops of runes and sigils, where do those come from now if I can't get them by salvaging equipment?
---
Unfortunately its kind of a staple in MMOs. That being said, hopefully the EU initiative to outlaw lootboxes in video games is gonna spread worldwide. They were a problem when Valve introduced them to the west, they still are a problem now, we just need to make sure that they all get removed.
---
This looks it was drawn with your feet, like i get everyone is pretending this is nice but lets not be delusional now everyone.
---
You are asking like 10 days before the content is released.
---
... You do realize it's all been designed and implemented and created already right? =P
---
Your expression of art is what inspires me to wake up every morning
---
But what is the explanation for thief Ambushes? Did they just trash an elite spec?
---
Crafting them directly, salavaging gear with the tune or sigil with a black lion salvage kit, or using an upgrade extraction kit
---
Yeah gw2 doesnt really require you to interact with anyone. Go nuts
---
how can I use all my 11 keys on my mmo mouse in gw2?
---
what would you rate it
---
There is a similar skin in game i think, but not sure what is it called.
---
Is it really the reason why they removed it? o.o How tf is it sexual?
---
new Dragonrise map inc s5 heard it here first
---
das heisst man kann die zusätzlichen tasten an der maus nicht benutzen?

You're still spending time to switch those skills/weapons, and besides, if you were to do so you could just use smoke bomb to begin with for the smoke field (but since scrapper elites are terrible, you can just go with the gyro instead). Either way, finishers aren't instant, so some time will still be wasted. Regarding the "if someone is revealed" part, no, it's not the same for other skills, because other skills usually don't require to hug the caster for a prolonged amount of time, and neither they ask to use blast finishers - usually offensive skills - to prolong that stealth, well knowing that doing so can nullify said stealth, just because the stealth provided by the skill itself is so short that it would be useless otherwise (and in actual combat situations, doing so is akin to waste the skill). In that regard, mass invisibility is far better - it hits 10 targets in a large range, and all the stealth is given at the same time, so the targets are free to move instantly (especially if traited, as that super speed is applied instantly...unlike scrappers, where you need to wait for the gyro to end for that). It's just that mesmers also end up having other useful elites to use, unlike scrappers, so they won't bother with it.

So the old way *only* works if you use a BL kit now?  Wow, that's... a lot.  Thanks for the answer.
---
One of the hearts in thunderhead keep, nearby it is a fighting pit u place bets on npc's to fight. You can give your npc boons and heal them to cheat.
---
Silverwastes is still my single favorite meta map. And I think the way maps like Auric Basin handle the meta (people can participate from all over the map, but you can also ignore the meta and just farm if you really want to with almost no disruption) are even better than full-map metas like Dragonfall and Dragonstand.
---
That said, I'll take Dragonfall and Dragonstand a hundred times over, compared to most other metas.
---
Kinda on the same boat, trying to get ppl onto base raiding and then onto cms isnt a bad goal and if you can incentovise it then sure but i personally think that oppening up the content (as in raid instances) to as many ppl is much kroe improtant.
---
I persojally dont think gw2 needs more than  dificulties, like ff14 a base easier nm and a repeatable harder cm mode should be enough. It should serve to give less skilled and short on time players something they can enjoy while also having a diff dificulty which pleases the more skilled part of the playerbase.
---
That isnt to say i dont want strike missions, i always wanted extra replaybility from lw and the idea of having lw story bosses as 10 man encounters is just too good to pass. It could maybe server as the trials content in ff14.
---
This post is shitting on someone else's previous artpost
---
I dunno. It's what i heard at that time. Can't fact check it now, anymore.
---
Strange, I always thought the reason was that it broke immersion when they switched to in-engine cutscences for story telling...
---
This post is all over the place. Yes, lootboxes or otherwise gambling with real money is a slippery slope. But temporary passes to PURELY CONVENIENCE areas do not fall under this category, nor do single-purchase expansions and living world episodes. 
---
Let's not act like everything that can be purchased multiple times or contains random loot drops counts as gambling, okay?
---
Yeah, the Volcanus. Mainly said that it was an ele because it's not such a common sword skin anymore.
---
I play a sylvari elementalist and I hear them.
---
Greatsword is usually a meta weapon on every profession that can wield it, elite spec on not.
---
Mesmer is probably the only profession where GS isn't just really op.
---
If you enjoy completetion then I guess it’s ok to come back. But pvp wise. Pvp is in an extreme low. As far as pve. Raids you will come to 2 new wings. W6/w7. If you left when you finished w6. Then w7 is a def let down.
---
danke dir :)))
---
You seem to be forgetting that I mentioned the account where I have too many stacks of obsidian shards is an alt, and the same seems to go for the OP on this thread.  The amount of effort required to make legendaries means that legendaries are not a real sink and people are "more often than not" going to be using their alts in such a manner.
---
When played accounts have unused stacks of some material built up, that is never a good thing.  It indicates a problem with the economy.  The game throws obsidian shards at you, but doesn't also load you down with the materials to make fulgurite or legendaries; doesn't offer you diverse options to consume them.  A similar thing happened with essences of luck once people maxed their account-wide magic find until finally Anet added a sink for that.
---
I used quote on quote because they weren't my words
---
There's an unsettling amount of truth in the claims of people saying "McDonalds made me fat."
---
It's high - carb, low fiber/protein food, which is specifically targeted towards making you want more instead of being filling. Food companies, and corn farming corporations especially, lobbied heavily to produce research that painted fat as the reason for obesity, ignoring the observable addictive properties of sugars and painting obesity as a personal failure instead of the inevitable result of corporations profiting off of involuntary and unconscious human behavior.
---
"Most people can control themselves" is faulty - firstly, they aren't the people being talked about in the obesity discussion in the first place, and secondly, if it were true then do you really think over 71% of US adults would be overweight or obese? [Because that's the reality.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm)
---
What's more useful here? Telling 71% of US adults that they can't control themselves, or maybe, just maybe, taking another look at how sugar is regulated, even if it means banning some of the menu items of a poor, helpless fast-food company that just *happens* to benefit heavily from those without self-control, and *surely* has never had any hand in attempts to erode that self-control in the pursuit of profit and growth?
---
thanks man you really saved my ass :)
---
I had the [same idea](https://imgur.com/echlDQb) about a year ago.
---
I have huge beef with them replacing Chemical Field with Detection Pulse.
---
From a design perspective, making that decision in all game modes basically deletes a tool belt skill for the Scrapper in PvE, where there's no reason to have stealth detection.
---
I would much rather they reworked this trait which nobody uses: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Expert_Examination
---
So that it provides a detection pulse when procced with an ICD. Or to have that trait add a detection pulse to function gyro.
---
Thanks!. Does seasons go to sell often? or just once per year on anniversary sale?
---
What are these books used for??
---
Thanks for the answer. Well I am into the story, as I enjoy the game Lore. Does seasons goes into sale often? or the curent sale happens once per anniversary sale?
---
I've been playing ffxiv a lot lately, and the depth of the emote system is insane. I don't understand why anet doesn't do something similar.
---
Dude if it were any more obvious it would have to personally send Peter Griffin to your house to explain the joke. It's honestly a you problem.
---
Thank you

Just found this video on facebook. Enjoy. :)
---
As an adult, you should never let anyone else control your money/access your accounts/decide how much you want to spend/etc.

---
Thanks for the feedback! I've updated the layout.
---
The Silverwastes ends up being pretty good about this IMO.  There are events that move from place to place, some that just happen on location constantly, and failing events can result in the loss of an area for events to take place in... All fueling the meta.  You can sit on exactly 1 fort and eventually produce the meta in SW, or you can join a group doing RIBA and go stir crazy but cause that meta to run often.  DF tries to capture some of this but the camps themselves never need defending, taking away any feeling of urgency for losing progress, and the areas are so vast and often annoying to get around that it just feels different IMO.  
---
For me personally, SW issue is that it's old and I've run so much of it over the years that it's at the point I can't stand to look at it anymore &gt;&lt;
---
These changes are kinda mote (outside of antitoxin) nerfing the meta classes wont change anything. The simple fact is no other classes even compare to scourge, rev, and fb. Nerfing these classes just making them less enjoyable. Other specs need to be buffed to have a chance in the meta
---
TLDR: Well yes, but actually no
---
Groceries cost *way* more than 40 bucks a week if you're living on decent food at three meals a day.
---
yep in-game screen.  Other times I posted screen without fog but this time it seemed nicer to have some mist in the air.
---
Swiss tournaments are pretty close, along with other things happening between seasons. (ex, 2v2)
---
Fuck loot boxes? Lol you could make the same argument about alchohol or Elmer's glue, maybe we should ban those too because you cant control yourself? Oh wait we tried that with alchohol, and it resulted in organized crime, more people drinking, and it became more dangerous as people sought it out in seedy location and the alchohol became dangerous as there were no purity standards or regulations on it of any kind. 
---
Heres the flip side, black lion keys have been out since the game started and I've only spent 0 dollars on them since they came out... so wtf?  Why is my experience not anymore valid then yours?
---
&gt;aside from WoW it's basically unprecedented for a game to last that long.

FFXIV, FFXI, Everquest, Runescape.

Riot Games focused entirely on LoL and it was a gigantic success, ArenaNet sees the game faltering and stupidly thought removing even more resources from it to make other stuff was a good idea.
---
When i said i was curious, i meant i was curious for an actual reason, not excuses like "they have to do other stuff!!"
---
Potentially adding mini seasons. 2v2 or 3v3. In between seasons to last 2-3 weeks. No idea when this will be implemented though. I'd expect a long wait. It'd be hype if they said it'd begin at the end of this season, but they didn't, so it's not.
---
I thought it was Marjory's sister's death where there was Jory having a meltdown in front of her sister's dangling body while Human Female Meta there was off to the side bored out of her mind. xD
---
Literally make an NPC bookshelf
---
this is the only change I don't really like. Imo they should have never gotten rid of the elite tool belt skills and just gave us another button or something. Was this even used in pve though? like I honestly can't think of anywhere outside of situations in pvp/wvw where you would want to use the poison field.
---
Ah, my mistake, I thought that doing the quest gave full access to a garden plot.  And I could've sworn that harvesting another garden only marked asc herbs as growing crops, but damn, that sucks even worse than I thought.  :/
---
Next time you see a group stacking to blast stealth use mass invis and let me know how it goes.
---
Then add /weirdflex
---
You're right that Chemical Field is not very useful, but it could be tuned.
---
They've also said they're looking for a way to make condition damage also work with Impact Savant, so there's a reason to keep it if it pans out.
---
Expert Examination is just... nobody uses it at all in any game mode. Moving Detection Pulse as a proc on that trait (or making it add Detection Pulse to Function Gyro) just seems way smarter than removing a tool belt skill for PvE.
---
When would it not be too soon? Make a countdown for that!
---
Do you play WvW? Blasting sneak gyros is meta. All serious guilds use it. Blasting steath has been a wvw staple forever.
---
Agreed. I'd prefer it as an emote because it looked fucking weird on my heavy armored classes back then.
---
That, and GW2 could really use some more emotes.
---
5/7
---
Thief already has dagger, so I don’t even know which elite spec ambushes would be tied to anyway.
---
Can you replace the background image with an array of Funko Pops when the counter reaches 0?
---
scrapper has forced all dps classes to run power damage only for a while now, removing it won't stop people from using firebrands and scourges as they still need more nerfs and people who are tired of that still won't enjoy the game but hitting scrappers condi clear is still really significant and a pretty huge change and you'll see a lot more variety in builds people use on fb, scourge and potentially other things since conditions will be relevant again if/when these changes go through.

To elaborate a bit more in English (sorry):
---
You might not necessarily want to set your keybindings to the new mouse buttons specifically but rather remap them. Instead of setting Weapon Skill 1 to Mouse Button 10 you could simply remap your Mouse Button 10 to press whatever bind you have it set to (default: "1"). This way if you're ever playing without that mouse or with a new mouse you won't have to change everything again.
---
Radial Mount Menu is this: https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial
---
You can set a key binding to open up a menu which will then activate another key binding based on mouse movement. For example:
---
* Raptor is set to "*"
---
* Radial Mount Menu is set to F8
---
* Mouse Button 4 is remapped to press F8
---
* &gt;*Mouse Button 4 opens Radial Mount Menu*
---
* &gt;*Move mouse upwards to select Raptor*
---
* &gt;*Radial Mount Menu enters "*\**" for you*
---
* &gt;*You mount your Raptor*

People were getting around the “ascended cooking mats can only be gathered by the instance owner” by using the reaping glyph.
---
could be one of those two! it was long ago, but definitely involved season 2 cutscene
---
50 man groups would just split into squads of ten each and stack on one commander.
---
The analogy falls apart when you consider that neither Anet nor any other gaming company lobbied to create a food landscape where people are receiving misinformation about something that is literally required to survive. So it's really more like "should we ban sports because some people can't help gambling on them?"
---
And because I'm a pedantic argumentative person (on reddit at least), I have to mention that McDonald's food is not as bad as you're painting it. A Big Mac has a good blend of macronutrients at an incredibly cheap cost. It **is** filling, and for many people it's a good deal in terms of protein and calories for their dollar, assuming you don't have the time or facilities to cook for yourself.
---
The big problems from fast food are a) sides and drinks, and b) micronutrients. The sides and drinks (mostly sodas and lemonade) are where they pack the sugar. They're completely avoidable, but incredibly addictive. And the micronutrients in fast food are basically non-existent, so if you eat only fast food you're not going to be healthy. 
---
Sugar is a problem in **all** food in the US, not just fast food. Shopping and cooking for yourself won't protect you from it. What I'm saying is if you're using sugar to vilify McDonald's specifically, you're kinda missing the forest for the trees.
---
The anatomy on the eyes is a bit off but damn thats great.
---
Totally agree.  That's why you would have some proximity factor to it.
---
Lotta downvotes but it's at least an innovative thought to reduce lag and spread out the fights.  If people like zerging they can still zerg just less magic find.
---
The meta game is inherently stale and stupid. It's just about coverage and very few people care about "winning" and people lack the server pride/loyalty that more had years ago.
---
/butok (=/shrug)
---
there are a fair number of groups that raid in OCE/asian timezones. ERP is in the middle of the night for us, and I only know of 1 OCE player who took part in the tournament
---
that being said NA is indeed less active in general compared to EU, and has fewer high end guilds (though they do exist, but are probably dwindling in playerbass for obvious reasons)
---
Okay. That's major enough to warrant a disabling

---
These.
---
They are way too flashy to have been for simple skill balance.
---
Can't find the post but I remember reading in 2012 that Anet promised to add more emotes "soon". To this day if you type things like /guitar there is no error message, because an emote is supposed to be added there aaaaany moment.
---
Maybe one day..
---
Tybalt, recap

Yes, commander.

aka another content they spent development resources on and never made it accessible/replayable
---
Is this an anet presentation?
---
Yeah. 
---
Imagine if you could go to the wardrobe, click any of the icons of BL-exclusive stuff you are missing, and buy it directly.   
---
To keep the trading post relevant, since it can only contain a limited number of items, the price for direct wardrobe purchase could be higher than from the gemstore.   
---
So we'd have: 
---
* Base price: When on sale in the gemstore. 
---
* Discounts: When on sale in the gemstore. Usually between -20% and -50% discount. 
---
* Uncatalogued price: Always available from the wardrobe all year round. Something like +10 to +20% of base price.
---
Kind of like games in the Steam store.
---
Mystic Clovers were always this way and will never change, if you want them "fast" use the guide for 10 if you want them slow but have a better chance use the guide for 1
---
This sub is toxic as hell, without being funny.
---
This is why u buy them using fractal. Or claim legendary crafting in login rewards
---
What a bullshit reason to remove an animation. 
---
Timmy is on a diet somewhere, so all cookies have been banned in the entire world.
---
If what you say is true anet fucked up worse than .. sorry.. i can't think of a similarly gigantic fuckup.
---
Other races have idle animations as well. Then they should've just changed everyone to grey stick figured
---
&gt;but this is just beyond unreasonable.
---
I dont see the issue. There's plenty of ways to get clovers.
---
Normally, yes. I don't think this applies for WvW.
---
The reason for that is simple. You can't play together with other players that are on different versions of the game. In PvE, that's no problem. You just keep playing and eventually there'll be fewer players as the ones on the newer version of the game will not be able to join your instance. In PvP, it's not much of a problem either. You just finish the match you're in and then you patch the game between matches.
---
But in WvW, everyone shares the same map. Unlike in PvE, there aren't multiple megaserver instances of Red Borderlands. There's one Red Borderlands map for three whole servers. When a patch hits, that map closes for the old version of the game and re-opens for the new version of the game.
---
Actually you can type in emotes for some other languages and they will play... Question being if your keyboard allows them to be entered in the correct language lol    
---
e.g. /si == /yes
---
Or our own home in the home instance with additional storage. :)
---
Amateur
---
I always found the human female idle awkward and annoying to look at. The idle gave the impression the character was bored, or trying to be cute and sexy (hands on waist, bombed breast, etc). I prefer less noisy and more neutral idles.
---
&gt; The fact that loot boxes aren't, by legal definitions, considered gambling baffles me.
---
It really shouldn't.
---
removed by user.
---
Amazing! Thank you ♥
---
Legendaries are supposed to be extremely difficult, super expensive, grindy, require to play all gamemodes hundreds of hours and take very long time (even an year) to craft, so everything is working as intended.
---
People keep saying this, but theres a cap on how many we can buy so they don’t even let you buy more, I doubt its all a grand plan to make you do the thing thats not even possible
---
just some salty dude peed of he cant buy a key most likely, and trying to say everything is a lootbox and its not fair.
---
kinda didnt read it all
---
New mini seasons and non-conquest off seasons.
---
As a passionate housing enthousiast who totally should play the Sim's or Animal Crossing instead of Guild Wars and has spend way too much money on the Home Instance, I agree 100%.
---
I also remember when you could get the Champion Troll fighting the Champ Lieutenant Ghost in Ascalon Catacombs explicable.
---
If you play WvW, look into the non-repeatable reward tracks as a good non-RNG source of clovers.
---
&gt;It's definitely guardian
---
That's a funny way of saying Warrior and Hundred Blades.
---
you are definitely in the minority, most people do not have nearly enough obsidian shards to do anything with. most people don't even have an alternate account, so creating a sink for a scarce material is still a bad idea.
---
&gt; ...grinding dead content...
---
...amusing...from someone crafting their very 1st legendary.
---
Take it from me, someone with 56 legendaries...you should quit now if this is enough to tire you out.
---
It's the ANet forums, it's filled to the brim with ass-kissing white knights that would likely eat the shit from the office toilets if a dev told them to.

---
Saying that it's "satirical" doesn't magically stop making it sound real mean spirited on your end
---
Legendary weapons cost thousands of gold for good reasons.... lol. We’ve all complained about clovers, but if you were to actually just go make them you would realize it’s not actually that hard or draining at all. It just costs a lot of gold. We’ve all been there. 
---
Tip: Gamble for 1 clover at a time, not 10.
---
And now even the Gem Store is bugged.  
---
What the hell is going on?
---
yeah then use your daily login chest or buy them with fractal relics
---
Even Core Necro is awesome in Open World.
---
Login server has problems, gem store has problems, people have reported problems and bugs constantly recently \[and the one response from ANet, to people that PAID for these things, is "wait a few weeks for the fix"\]
---
What the heck is going on all of a sudden?
---
You don't get to choose the contextual meaning of what other people say.
---
power reaper
---
He means Necromancer, Reaper's the HoT spec.
---
He is a human being, treat him with respect and dignity and try not to offend him!
---
If you want to play ranged with berserker stats, P/P Deadeye is crazy powerful in Open World.
---
The sky will forever impress me in this game
---
It's amazing how people keep mixing those things up and keep repeating how "we've seen it in GW1 already".
---
Yeah but expecting an entire idle system overhaul for one problematic case (female human) is a bit unrealistic, hence why an emote would be a middle ground.
---
They haven't always been this way. Originally there was no way to get them from PvP and WvWv reward tracks or from doing fractals or monthly login chests.
---
same here, let's hope it will get fixed soon
---
It's almost all one-time buys though, nothing to spend the huge influx of karma we get on. Plus, spending it on map currency is gated, it's more like "you get a pittance of map currency for repeating hearts" than "trade karma for map currency"
---
LWS4 was an Expansion - size living word season. Trust me. The  maps are big, lots of Metas going on around and many new useful stuff you would be great full of having.  The roller Beatle itdta fine mount to have. But never as useful as the griffon or the Skyscale. The bet. Of all is that you can farm the items and stuff from the skyscale while doing the más so at the end of the story you'll be se steps ahead for the Skyscale. The currency of each map gives you some new trinkets (for witch doctor stats for example) and some craftable 32-slots bags worth getting.
---
I'd say definitely yes!
---
.. Oh and the story is awesome. The best ivseen in a LWS SO FAR.
---
"Thank you so much."
---
Ah yes, the classic strategy of "trolling".
---
My favorite part is all of it.
---
Can't be, because Pale Tree created Sylvari long before death of Zhaitan and rest of the dragons absorbing his released magic which would allow them to use dead bodies to use dead bodies to mass replicate minions. A much more dark reason could be that Ronan is still alive, inside the tree, being used as a template to create new Sylvari.
---
ty so much &lt;3
---
Deet has two dads.
---
Go bother the Dark Crystal subreddit for a while.
---
This comment just made you my new best friend.
---
I'm moving in next week to live on your couch.
---
I play scourge condi or power reaper depending on the enemies. 
---
Condi scourge is great for solo stuff throwing out high damage and having a lot of survivability. 
---
Reaper does decent enough dmg to remove mobs in your way and has okay survivability, it's not as strong as other classes DPS wise but open-world it doesn't matter.
---
&gt; If Anet spent more time on replying to concerns regarding actual CONTENT and less time on showcasing cringeworthy political views, the game would be in a much better state.
---
Replying to specific issues on the forums doesnt update the game servers by magic. Or any other way.
---
Trash mechanics.
---
&gt;it's always frustrating to be blindsided.
---
Or you know, you can uh, I don't know, do your own research first before taking on a daunting task. It's not like the game wiki exists right?
---
Same thing happening to me. The only alternative I can think of are gem cards (from Gamestop).
---
No, they're just don't know how to use that thing that sits on top of their shoulders.
---
My favourite is the /tomestone emote you get from linking to the FFXIV Companion App. Nothing better than looking at memes on your Tomestone when your raid group is dying in E4S.
---
I did, before i quitted the game (for the second time) since i was fed up with their engineer so-called balancing and that nonsensical rework of the function gyro (basically just an excuse to remove the elite toolbelt). And that sneak gyro blast was and is used for a single purpose: scrappers, that are used only as healers/condi cleaners in zergs, had few choices for their elite skills. And with the removal of the elite toolbelt, the only useful skill for such a build was the sneak gyro. And i said in the other posts, most of the stealth is wasted by stealthing further with the smoke field...just because the stealth given by the skill itself isn't good at all. It is useful if used with several other skills, you say? Well, so much for being an elite skill then. If i needed a smoke field, i could have used a smoke bomb to begin with. That comes with a whole kit and a far lesser cooldown.
---
It's not that skill that's strong. It's the alternatives that are terrible. An healer/condi cleaner that had to stay often on medkit has no use for elixir X (transformation), supply crate (the only useful thing was the toolbelt, the turrets are horrible) or mortar (the only useful skill for a condicleaner/healer is the elixir shell, and it isn't enough to warrant its use). As far as elites go, it's terrible. It's used only because it's a smoke field, else people wouldn't bother. And whatever cooldown they'll give, it won't ever be fine, cause it's a stealth skill and in this game stealth is broken by design. I've said it many times in the forum before: they should just have scrapped that skill and made something else.
---
Guardians, rangers and mesmers all have very solid, but very different greatsword options. I think warriors do too. On mesmers, they're a ranged weapon, though, because mesmer. 
---
The blue flamey greatsword is a guardian sword in all but name and it's fun to play with.
---
It's already there as a dumb fkajding box that people use to troll after killing Oct ovine and spawn it inside chests so people won't notice they're using it instead of the chest and wonder why you're not getting loot 
---
Im salty already xD
---
Next, you're gonna argue that buying vegetables is gambling.
---
Home instance maps need an overhaul. The maps are so dated, and boring. The human instance is the only okay one. The Sylvari instance is so small, the Charr instance is ugly and weird, Norn instance is weird, I would rather something like Cragstead. Asuran instance is uhhh... So yeah, it would be really nice to see some updates on the entire cities as well.
---
I've completed every map with every profession with both Berserker and Viper gear.
---
The only real difference that is worth noting is that Sourge and Reaper necromancers with minion builds can easily solo way more enemies.  
---
So many that you take less time listing the ones they can't solo like a walk in the park, which is basically world bosses with timers that require other players to trigger effects like Tequalt and Mordremoth's Mouth, the queen mushroom hero challenge in tangled depths, and a few PoF bounties when they get annoying random powers that make them more durable or heal themselves.
---
&gt; To be fair, they are mentioned ingame as vanished/extinct.
---
It was probably all those gargoyle skulls Nicholas was asking for on certain weeks.
---
Living in an MMO is fucking life now adays?  Damn.
---
must be some life if its saturday or sunday and youre complaining online about a mmo
---
Ooh damn dude you got me on that one!  Should have read and taken notes on every step with every crafting material on the wiki.  Good shit dude!
---
Gelfling approves

---
That's not it. They're just holding off until the s5 release because they don't want to add anymore changes ahead of that one in their pipeline.
---
It is almost like this happens every single time something is announced or released. There are a shitton of screaming for a couple of days and then everything just goes back to normal, until the next outrage.
---
We know an expansions aren't coming, that's something.
---
I want me a full Codex, not just for all the book, but also for other pieces of lore. Like:
---
* Books
---
* Bestiary
---
 * First kill unlocks the model and name for preview.
---
 * After enough kills you also see their stats and skills.
---
 * After more kills you also get their drop table. 
---
* NPC profiles.
---
 * For story-related NPCs, unlocked when completing a story step with the NPC in it. 
---
* Soundtrack player (which could also play custom tracks)
---
* Loading screen art.
---
* Location descriptions (the ones that were meant to appear in loading screens)
---
people have moved away from chrono with the clone and shatter changes most use base mesmer or mirage now. If you think the only value in scrapper is healing and condi clear well..I don't think you really know much about scrapper, i'm sorry.
---
Nah dude, we're done here because I threw you a DM and you're not willing to talk unless you're the center of attention.  If you want to call me pussy then don't back down when I call you out lmao
---
Is he a Habsburg?
---
&gt; Why aren't more people talking about this? Why is it back to the art threads on the front page?
---
Because there's the stickied thread but hardly anyone's gonna bother because there's less exposure as opposed to making a new post
---
Also, mods have clarified that they'll more strict in terms of new posts about this.
---
What makes it worse is that warbler actually looks like the Beaded Caller, the hylek warhorn.
---
I mean my playtime has significantly lessened. Could be it feels "back to normal" because people have finally given up.
---
Sure if he was actually a victim of anything. No one forced him into anything. He had full agency over his actions.
---
&gt; I can't in good conscience vote for the face of the Black Lion Trading Company. I'd sooner vote for the Consortium
---
Honestly they're both pretty horrible but I think that according to the lore the Consortium wins the "Caring less about ethics at the time of making money" award.
---
it's what i like to call "drama fatigue". those people actually concerned/angry exhaust themselves until they themselves get tired of voicing their criticism and explaining the same thing over and over again to white knights and those too lazy to look at the previous 30 elaborate threads. anet just has to wait. sure, all the criticism will resurface at the next opportunity, but the pure wild (justified) shitstorm where everyone backs each other up has blown over by then, diminishing the effect of any follow-up.
---
and it's a damn shame for the health of the game, because anet, naturally, uses this to their advantage.
---
I mean it's ironic that you call this a bait and yet you *want* me to talk you. What do you really need? A pat on the shoulder and "good job, you sure showed us by portraying yourself as an entitled brat who'd rather have things spoonfed to them as opposed to trying at all."?
---
I'm not sure why you expect that from me.
---
**REAL** key runners use a level 60 scroll,  exotic [leveling armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leveling_equipment#Armor_2), bloodbound weapons and go all the way to The Batte of Claw Island.

Watch this please. Convenience items are where these companies get most of their money. Convenience also usually means a company creating a problem to then sell you the fix. It's not gambling, but still shitty.
---
A 37 reaper, you say?
---
I became a gate on WvW several times lol
---
In Tera there is an event sometimes, where random bosses fight each other in an arena and you get set money on them :D
---
Well at least wvvwvw complaining deale with the video game.
---
Nope. Just got "Glorious air!" and "Supportive earth!" from my Sylvari tempest. If you play weaver it gets changed to a different set noted on the attunement page. That was around 3 rounds of swapping through all 4 elements so that is around a 16% chance of triggering.
---
... and going for another round, got another "Ferocious fire!"
---
... and a few more rounds gets "I am river and ocean!"
---
... and "Earth and stone conform to my will!"
---
so I can safely say it works for sylvari .... at least female sylvari 
---
also tempest or core and not weaver
---
“Fuck loot boxes and the mentality it’s harmless”
---
... you chose to spend all that, dude. And besides that, even if you regret it now, there’s no denying you gained in game from it. They’ve built it now so it’s not a total waste
---
THIS 👍
---
So quit.
---
It's not hard.
---
Try it...but you're addicted...so, I'm sure it's hard for someone like you with a "life".
---
I'm sorry, is this sarcasm or are you actually this naive?
---
This is the first fanart that I have upvoted
---
No one tell him he also has to do world completion....
---
Amazing community. Amazing fanart. This deserves recognition by the devs.
---
&gt; new expansion 
---
Not an expansion. They are not calling it a living world season either. It's a "saga". Whatever that really means we'll have to wait and see. 
---
As for new PvP content it's all future plans:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features
---
* Automated Swiss tournaments.
---
* On-demand tournaments. 
---
* Special tournaments
---
* Mini-seasons with other modes like 2v2 deathmatch between Conquest seasons.
---
* A new armor set on top of the new weapon set we already got.
---
* And of course the occasional new map, reward tracks and balance updates should keep coming slowly over time. Including a large custom arena for large scale matches.
---
Several of those can be tossed/sold since you can either buy it back for the same price as the sell price or get it back for free by interacting with the appropriate object.
---
Fort aspenwood and jade carry where great but so much pve for pvp purist, also the mechanic of RA(winers stay loser team disbanded, reward increases after every round) for unranked and offseasons would be great
---
I love Frostgorge Sound.
---
i see you put as much effort into this drawing as anet did into that outfit
---
Warrior is designed to not have access to protection because of their already high vitality and armor.
---
That's why Spellbreaker having protection on Full Counter is so crazy strong.
---
I think you underestimate how many people actually left Guildwars 2 for WoW classic (and others). There were several people that raided on a daily basis, training runs and full clears on alts, that no longer play. Sure they might come back, but for now the feeling of "I tried for 4 years to get Anet to give me something and I'm done trying" is pretty fresh. The people that were talking about leaving after the ERP and the disasterous announcement weren't all joking. 
---
It's back to square one, because the people that weren't satisfied with square one are either currently, or in some cases permanently, no longer bothering with a company that seems to not care about them.
---
Whirling Wrath can be used while moving around, hits 5 enemies, and it's a whirling finisher.
---
Try to take 1 step durin a Hundred blades, and there goes all the damage.
---
Warrior with berserker stats. Axe/axe and greatsword. AoE crit everything. It's so incredibly easy and satisfying.
---
What's the point in making Chapter 2 of Tome of Courage apply Retaliation when Spellbreaker already has a utility that does the exact same thing?
---
That's just duplicating an ability existing skill.
---
Is it too late?
---
Reaper and Holosmith
---
It's a clear no if you're looking at the stuff they "revealed" during the show.
---
The question you posit is a philosophical one.
---
What is a soul? Are souls even real? What are the limits of conscience? 
---
Can bots, AFKs, cheaters be counted as people even though they are nothing but souless empty husks?
---
You're right, that was an exaggeration.
---
Idk why, but its kinda refreshing to see something drawn „different“
---
Would fit right in with The Dark Crystal cast.
---
I’m still leveling my rogue so I haven’t gotten to try daredevil yet, but so far I’m loving the thief mobility built into the class. S/D or D/D is so fun just dancing around the enemy while hitting them, S/D dual wield ability especially is my favorite. I feel like a fencing ace just spinning around like some kind of sinister ballerina
---
Huh...you don't say:
---
&gt; Sorry that I have a life.
---
Jaw dropping reference.
---
We'll probably see her again, but probably not with the same relevance... That's what I loved about Aurene, we interacted with her through a lot of time, and you always got to realise that aurene was next to you, that she was important, after all she's like a daughter...
---
That is just a digital claw crane machine ...

As for the other parts ... yes pay attention to your spending. It's not just loot boxes. Life offers many ways to waste piles of money. It doesn't matter if it is RNG or not, you can still end up spending a lot. Seems like you are just stating the obvious. Not sure if this will help those who need it.
---
Mourning for WvW is my daily
---
It's not. If you need specific lower level materials, it's better to go through the unidentified gear at level 80 and use that gold to buy the lower level materials.
---
You literally have no idea what scrapper does do you? Is your only understanding of it that it clears condi's with antitoxin? The gyro has been used widely for stealth since they gave it the field because its incredibly easy and effective to stealth even large groups with it more so than mass invis. Do I really need to explain how huge its superspeed uptime has been not to mention its incredibly high healing and group damage reduction? Not really sure why you even bothered to bring up the forums when they've been a ghost town in general for years, not really sure what you were trying to prove with that one. Scrapper will still be incredibly strong without antitoxin and the gyro is not weak or terrible in any sense when its literally the best and most effective way to stack stealth at the moment.
---
repocin...some of us give the books away, yes.
---
RIP his ping, especially since he's in Australia.
---
Legendaries are long term goals, so are mystic clovers. However, you can use gold to speed it up. 
---
I don't see where the "beyond unreasonable" problem is.
---
DH Guardian. Best burst Aoe in the game for quickly clearing packs and a block that refreshes every time you mount up, makes it the best gathering class.
---
Enlighten the world with your teachings ~ good night
---
Sure, but in GW2 you can't even do that, just delete them.
---
alright then, keep your secrets
---
Don't forget the unbound magic chest things. It's actually rng too, but you *make* gold by using them instead of spending gold.
---
Hey, nothing wrong with being a crossdresser IRL. They do what makes them comfortable, I think that's cool.
---
I just think changing the game to accommodate someone for arbitrary reasons is stupid. It's the same level of ridiculousness as when the devs changed the Compact menu option just because AuroraPeachy cried on stream.
---
&gt;What, exactly, would "themed like raids" be?
---
Well, the HoT raids had a clear White Mantle theme, as well as subthemes like Bloodstone, GW1 Prophecies, etc. Envoy armor doesn't seem to carry any of those themes. The PoF raids wouldn't really be relevant since the Envoy stuff is all HoT.
---
The point is, 1. If raids had never existed, they still would have made Legendary armor at some point between 2015 and 2019, just due to the natural progression of the game. 2. Without raids, this armor would have been introduced via some other method, most likely similar to existing Legendary Trinket quests. 3. Since Envoy armor seems to have no thematic connection to the raid content itself, there's no reason to believe that this Legendary Armor would not keep the Envoy design, with or without raids.
---
Ohshit I did forget about those
---
Anet please, we need the Lynx face emblem!
---
Looks sick! :-D
---
&gt; If you gamble 10 and loose, that’s 0/10... but if you gamble it by 1’s then your chances go by 1/10, 2/10, 3/10 and so on. 
---
It's the same way with winning. If you gamble only 1 and win, you get 10 clovers with the large recipe, but only 1 with the small one and have 76 gambles left. 
---
However, I think the feeling is a big part here. If you craft the large recipe 4 times and "only" get one (-&gt;10) clover and three times nothing, it might feel like bad luck. But if you craft the small recipe 40 times, also get 10 clovers in the end but get them every now and then, you alway have a win inbetween instead of 1 win and then only looses.
---
It's not a parody! This is the same high quality art that this sub normally has.
---
i like version 1 more
---
Like core Tyria xp as well?
---
Oh, I accept that in the eyes of this community I am incorrect, and you're right, it may even be objectively true.  I don't deny this one bit.  I'm only responding because people feel the needs to hurdle around statements like "get a fucking job."  I'd ask you the same; why are you responding?  It's a waste of your time and you're wrong to be doing so; accepting this is part of growing up.
---
What do you mean by surprise mechanics?
---
Power quickness firebrand was absolutely fun, a bit on the squishy side though so you have some challenge with tougher enemies, or when you are fighting a horde.
---
Best community ever! I love to show off my skins to my friends. Aurene is so cute.
---
WvW is for gift of battle right? Don't worry it will be over soon.
---
I'm sorry, i think you didn't understand, so let me repeat it and give you a bit more info and hopefully you'll get what i mean.
---
RAPID FIRE SLASHING WITH A GREATSWORD AND IT IS CALLED HUNDREDS BLADES.
---
I hope the awesomeness of this skill has been reminded to you.
---
Doesn’t effect gem store sales. Zzzzzzzzz
---
Never has the behavior of these fanboys been described so well.
---
Well the job thing ties back to the fact that the game has a currency exchange mechanic, which allows for real money to be traded in for gold. If your time is so valuable, you should really consider it. 
---
Also, you called me a “white knight” for having the mental capacity to use the internet, a vast network of information, to figure out what I need to craft a legendary. 
---
If you don’t like being told you’re bitching about something, consider your thought process, and if it makes ANY logical sense at all. Thats pretty much all it comes down to.
---
No, I just think these posts are over represented, similar to your opinion about wvwvw posts.
---
Please make sure you credit the artist and/or ask before you add something to their art :)

A true masterpiece
---
As i said, it is used for healing and condi clean - it's the only meta role build engineer has got (but mostly due to condi clean - the sustained healing of scrappers is nice, but depending on the situation the burst heal other classes can provide is better). Guess you couldn't bother to read my past posts properly. Funny you mention the super speed uptime though - since super speed doesn't even stack. And most of it is given via traits as far as scrapper goes. So you end with overlapping superspeeds (because you sure aren't waiting to use gyros only for their delayed superspeeds) or wasting the ones given by blast finishers. So much for good designs, eh. And lastly you mention group damage reduction - oh, you mean the bulwark gyro, i guess? Again with the demented designs. The barrier is pitiful for WvW, and the damage reflection is a terrible idea to start with. A good way for a scrapper to die, and not even for its fault. Sure, tell me how great it is to die because your allies stepped in some aoes. The defense field is good, but the bulwark itself is just a terrible joke. And again, it's meaningless to say that it is "the best and most effective way to stack stealth". It's a smoke field on an elite, used just because there is no decent elite for an healer/condi cleaner. You could just put out smoke bomb and switch the kit as far as smoke fields go. Or use any other smoke field, for that matter.
---
But i cannot expect to have a decent discussion with someone that just has no idea what he's talking about. Keep defending things you don't even know, i'm out.
---
Obsidian Sanctum will tick down your WvW participation; which is enough to make it a bad option for some players.
---
That said, a guild hall covers a lot of what OS can do, other than the trading post.
---
It's even worse than lootboxes, it's a battle pass to get a lootbox.
---
Man, I just saw the final stretch goals for money and pledges and now I'm sad there are only three days left in the campaign. I'd love that coloring book (fight me), and I'd buy the shit out of that third variant cover with Astralaria.
---
Please support this if you're interested and haven't done so yet. It looks amazing so far.
---
They haven't even bothered to give us a pep talk about everything that happened, it was just another complete silence. One would think they would try to damp all the shitfire that was happening, since it was even hitting the news, but...nothing happened, there was 0 acknowledgement. 
---
It is what it is, since they are bundling HoT with PoF now, being a new player has never been this good, you can play everything in gw2, for about 70 dollers, which is fucking amazing for a new player, there is enough content to last for 2 years. Which seems is how they plan on keeping the boat floating, new players to refresh all the old ones leaving
---
Didn't ya know? You paid actual money for the game and the drops are RNG, therefore the entire game is just one big slot machine.
---
How about a complimentary Glyph of Reaping for the wait since it was Anet that broke and intends to leave this sitting until the 17th?
---
You don't even need to look at other modern games. Just look at GW1. Their [emote list](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Emote) dwarfs the one in GW2, and on top of that, each emote would vary based on which profession you played.
---
I like both versions equally.
---
&gt; ...absolutely no one is asking for an overhaul to the entire system. 
---
Except the user I replied to suggesting an idle personality system akin to FF14? But sure, go on and do a petty dig at me.
---
&gt; They're asking for the damn animation to be fixed and added in after years of having said they would do it.
---
Get your fact straights. There’s nothing to be fixed because there is nothing broken. Anet never said they would look into it.
---
The removal of a few animations in the idle was a **deliberate choice** made by Anet because they deemed a few of them were immersion breaking during real time cutscenes (mostly during LS2). You’d think that if Anet truly intended to bring these back, they would have done so in the last four years of people “like you” (see, I can point fingers too) being constantly vocal about this particular case.
---
The alternative that was often suggested was either a personality system for different idles for a wide variety of taste to simply reverting the changes. But four years later, I think it would be time for people to get a clue.
---
It's "quote unquote" , for fucks sake
---
Again, quote unquote. Don't use terms if you can't even spell them.
---
No, it's "quote unquote"
---
Hmm... well agree to disagree. But that's just me being kind of bias I guess. Maybe they could look at nerfing both?
---
And since there's nothing to be kept alive, nobody's talking about it.
---
Both what?
---
I hate those desert material coffers so much. Seriously, 4 clicks just to get through each coffer is cancer relative to every other bag/chest/selection thing in the game. These coffers are the one thing in the game that I just delete in mass rather than opening.
---
Waypoints are like my lifeblood, man. I explore GW2 maps more than I explore most games because I know I can easily zip around if I get stuck, lost, or farther from my eventual destination than originally intended. They make necessary travel feel easy breezy, which leaves more time for me to wander around and poke at interesting things. Honestly, the more involved travel becomes, the less inclined I am to enjoy it or partake in it during my downtime. For me personally, it's less about whether or not WPs make the game easier and more about the freedom they provide.
---
I'd love to see more rewarding gathering and world bosses though. For the former, it would be so nice to see little gathering areas with multiple nodes, instead of having them be solo. Groupings of nodes feels more rewarding when you finally find what you're looking for. Instead of a single plant or ore, it's a mini cluster that feels like hidden treasure. :D
---
Maybe some more variety in boss fights? Better rewards? Interesting events leading up to the fight? It does feel quite repetitive after awhile, but I love the big group aspect of the fights and it'd be great to see this content get some TLC.
---
Ahahaha, get a load of this guy
---
Can't be chrono on level 2
---
If you don't believe me try to fights vs competent revs like some of those on wsr
---
Oh sorry I had edited the above comment, I was talking about how Incensed Response makes up the majority of a Herald's might upkeep and that reducing that to PvP levels would help bring down the damage do to not having perma 25 stacks.
---
You realize that there is a Q&amp;A on the OFFICIAL forums about wvw balances right now?
---
I swear reddit is for the people who would get banned posting the bullshit they do here on the actual forums.
---
Even without that trait, might would be permanently at 15 and you'll always be capped at the start of the fight with empowers and tempests.
---
Sure it's part of the problem, but it's not the main offender.
---
Honestly, the main thing I'm thinking in other MMOs is "I wish this game had waypoints like GW2." I would absolutely hate this and probably quit.
---
Wait...isn't this whole respawn zone thing basically like in WoW? i haven't played a lot of WoW, but I seem to remember a system like this when I died...actually isn't the zone travel thing from WoW too?
---
This all around seems like a horrible idea. Travelling by foot in this game is horrendously slow as it is, forcing people to run across the entire map to get back to their current objective seems like a very easy way to make people uninterested in continuing on with the game, there are already areas on core maps where you have to travel ages from the nearest WP to get to certain events, removing WPs altogether would just make this so much worse.  
---
Also, your reasoning for the world boss train terrible, some people do actually enjoy world boss trains, and this would just ruin it for them as well as for anyone looking to fight WBs for the first time. Making players run all the way across the map again after dying does not automatically make the experience an "adventure", what ot makes it is tedious. By technical definition, I suppose this suggestion is an "adventure", but definitely not an enjoyable or fun one, I highly doubt many people would like to experience it more than once.  
---
We already have map exclusive harvestables in the form of LW currencies, and people tend to abhor having to farm those, so the map exclusive resources idea will not be popular overall, and personally, I don't want to have to deal with a map I hate just because it has that one useful crafting ingredient. Why would the tools/glyphs that give you random resources need to be removed in this scenario? You're basically forcing people to adhere to a horrendous reward system if you did that on top of restricting resources.  
---
All in all, this sounds a lot like you're suggesting GW2 be turned into WoW. I entirely disagree that any of these suggestions would make the current core game more enjoyable in any way, if anything, I'd say that all of these changes would take away a lot of what makes GW2 what it is, and why people enjoy it, it's a lot more forgiving and casual with the current system, and that's why a lot of people who play GW2 prefer it to something like WoW.
---
I like how there weren’t hearts in HoT. I don’t know why the regressed to them come PoF but I’m disappointed
---
&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN HOW THEIR CULTURAL ARMOR LOOKS?
---
You can opt out of cultural armors or sexy attires and choose to not wear them.
---
You cannot opt out of idle animations.
---
Ok, well I believe you. I'm sure it's not a 1 off thing either, but I was sort of hoping you had the screenshots or what have you.
---
I mean fair warning personal experience I've not actually gotten hit by a CoR that high so frankly the numbers seem a little blown up to me but I have no reason NOT to believe you so I do.
---
If you have a life why don't you just buy the legendary?
---
I will never understand why everything has to be a dickmeasuring contest with you people. I'm very well aware that we have had people leave in the past. Doesn't change the fact that it's happening now as well.
---
Also, I would argue, there is a pretty big difference between people leaving because the game got changed in a more or less substantial way and people leaving because they have to literally wait for 10 months for content.
---
But hey, you are correct that Guildwars 2 has a massive casual audience and a small scene of people that care to learn the combat system past "press 1 and loot". Guess we don't have to care about that small scene, despite it being literally responsible for the most exposure this game has gotten in the past 7 years from content creators ;)
---
Seems like a lot of people expected a quick reply and swift action from ANet in regards to the PAX announcement even though anything concrete would take a while to do. We've already seen posts on the forums in regards to prospective balance changes, and everything else is hype work for Icebrood. That's pretty much all that cna be expected
---
Still better than male medium tops
---

---
i'd love to leave that central column. with the end of S4 anet had the perfect setup to leave dragons and the mostly known areas behind for a while. alas...
---
you shoud try draw a picture of your agony.
---
It is if you don't have time and you want it immediately. But having legy doesn't give you anything special so if you don't like the grind and don't want to spend the money, there's really no reason to even craft it.
---
What's the point of having legy if you're not even playing that often and not playing content that could use its functions?
---
Could definitely pull himself off *to* a female charr
---
That's my point? Cor isn't the only issue that's a 29k vault and it's the same shit without telegraphed aoe and also while evading everything
---
Coming from a subscriber to askthedonald you lack credibility in this area.
---
warclaw release was the last time i ever bought gems. i have no more hope left for this game mode. never buying gems again. just cant support this bs company.
---
Number 2 feels more connected to the world.
---
people have tried that for years and it still hasn't worked so this is what they get. no need to white knight for anet, they brought this upon themselves.
---
I thought you meant other rev skills lol. But I agree, GS zerker and staff DD can be very obnoxious considering their telegraphs and defenses. Luckily reaper isn't much played.
---
That's so incredibly stupid, wow.
---
The spellbreaker shoulders clip with just abouy every shield but they still look good. Just leave it wtf is this baby shit dude
---
i'm not sure the game will have enough players left by the time they are ready to get started on an expansion
---
I agree with this sentiment. However I think the tall tree forest in the Bitterfrost map made it extremely more favorable to me. In all of the game it is my favorite aesthetically pleasing map
---
Thanks for the live preview ;)
---
is that Old Reddit? Mine's all looking different
---
I didnt realize looking at multiple points of view erased my EMT license. Also, people who try to invalidate someone else by looking into their subs are pretty sad. Get better.
---
Exactly.  When the leftists devs allow feelings to make their decisions instead of logic, or what others want, then I have a big issue with them and their entire ideology.   If you pay attention to what is happening in the political spectrum, which oddly now also includes gaming and the alphabet community, we are starting to see things shifting back towards the right.  Give a couple of more years and I think these types of alphabet community devs will go the way of the dodo bird as normalcy comes back (follow the money trail which is what the game companies that hired these dildo devs will do).  Twitter outrage mobs are already losing their grip and power so give it time.
---
I just notice, the portal to the Bane, it just one huge slide down.
---
Well, the point was, those original people who left when HoT came out, probably wouldn't have minded waiting longer for content, because they were relatively happy with what parts of the game were there.  Sure everyone wants more content, but the core game was larger with more to do for players like me. 
---
The problem is the hard core community is now the communty that's angrier. I see the same mantras quite frequently...2 hours of content every four months.  It's a blatant exaageration by people who don't actually play or make use of that content. If you don't think there are people playing the Dragonfall meta, I don't know what to tell you.  And spread out all over the world doing stuff.  It's like someone makes a comment about how many people left. Tell me. Honest. How many people left?  Give me a number? Is the percentage higher or lower now than then.
---
The problem is that people who are disatisfied now believe the game will end when they leave. And the people who left before, and it wasn't just when HoT launched, there were other times too, those people also believed the game would end. It's one thing to say well, I'm dissatisfied I'm leaving. It's another to imply the game is over because I'm leaving. People keep talking about the number of people. So? What's the number? Tell me, I'm curious. 
---
There have been multiple times when large groups of people left this game. The game is still here. And now it's 7 years old and it's still here.   
---
Those leaving never thing there's a strong group of people who are satisfied or enjoying the game. And yeah, I see that as an issue. Why do you think your disenfrachised side can say what you want, and no one has a right to rebut you?
---
tbh i'd gladly pay for new idle/stance animations. the way the male sylvari and human stand is so weird
---
I literally don't care about grammar right not, im busy with guild missions at this very moment.
---
A decent compromise. +1.
---
They did it purposefully to punish everyone who catered to the human female meta...just to spite you.
---
&gt;There's nothing in GW2 that replaces the role classic quests filled.
---
I kinda feel like the Side Stories do. Burden of Choice and Knight of the Thorn at least.
---
Got to farm those upvotes, eh?
---
&gt;i prefer something that i can play with berserker stats.
---
that's literally every class in the game, and every class is good for open-world PvE
---
Imo meteor shower shouldn't show its target circle, it should have smaller "fill in" circles to telegraph each meteor fall.
---
Then they can stop handing it heavy-handed nerfs since the problem is that you failed to dodge the telegraphed attack, not that you were nailed by 2 consecutive crits you had little to no warning of.
---
Also has the potential to make it more effective area denial since you can't know right away exactly where the safe boundary is.
---
&gt; Why aren't more people talking about this?
---
because nothing has changed.. we still get to play the game.
---
Why mourning? WvW dailies are fast and easy.
---
So literally aura infusions, but as a dye and only one time use.
---
There would be a lot to chose from I dont even know where to look haha
---
ding ding ding we have a winner
---
Alright, that explains it. Thanks!
---
You must be new..
---
It looks like they go on sale about twice a year. The wiki has the gem store history for the [Season 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history), [Season 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history), and [Season 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_4_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history) complete packs.
---
Snowy maps are the least aesthetically pleasing imo. Snow, trees, rocks, repeat. Utterly bleak. Same as in GW1. Personal opinion, but I've always disliked the Shiverpeaks. I'm looking forward to the charr homelands, but the faster we can get in and out of Jormag's bland territory, the better.
---
lmao, enjoy. Also, happy that you took the time and watched some videos. It's a weird part of youtube.
---
Wasn’t it obvious that you don’t?
---
