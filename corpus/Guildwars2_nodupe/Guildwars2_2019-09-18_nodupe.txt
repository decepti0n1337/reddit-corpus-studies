Yea I know the difficulty of the squad mode and also puged it - just though others might not have had the public mode error.
---
---
---
How do you even know those skins exist?
---
I think our banner here says how well 'taming' jormag will go.
---
Hey, thanks for the mention! :D
---

---
Three weapon names were replaced at some point shortly before/after release:
---
* Harpoon -&gt; Spear
---
* Shortbow -&gt; Short bow
---
* Speargun -&gt; Harpoon gun
---
You can see these three live in old videos. Even earlier, before the betas, neither underwater weapons nor shortbows existed. Originally, the longbow was called just bow, and polearms were an actual weapon. Later on, polearms were replaced by shortbows, and many polearm skins were salvaged into harpoons/spears.
---
I had a great moment after the kid's event with a random guy, when the second event (big brother) happened.
---
He was like "Wait, did we just beat up that guy's sister?"
---
Me: "I dunno, I wasn't paying attention. But, uh, I guess we're gonna beat him up? Now?"
---
im a huge collector of funkopops. if you are just being a toxic white knight that you are. please do not include me in your toxicity
---
You can see them in the "Metal Legion Shirt" achievement and also this https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5jnhf/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_september/
---
By Opening the Vault of Khan Ur. For that you have to gather the 4 legion keys by completing the 4 metas. You can open the Vault once a day and you will get a container which has a rare chance of giving you one of these items.
---
The vault and strike mission.
---
That's a [leviathan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leviathan).
---
Metal legion better be there in the final confrontation with Jormag
---
Where in the link?
---
That's not a new texture. It's also seen in some places with priory and whispers.
---
* Braziers in the JP sometimes don't work.
---
* If you crash/DC/etc when inside Braham's cell, the door closes and you're forced to TP out.
---
* Sometimes the 4 tree combination for THAT PoI just won't give a damn and won't work, you have to end up doing it again.
---
* Killing the first enemy during the starting quest \[the one Rytlock's son has to fight\] sometimes prevents the mission from continuing, forcing a restart.
---
* Doing the public version of the Strike sometimes gives an error or crashes.
---
I'm still SHOOK by that metal legion concert.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hands down the best gw2 experience I've had EVER
---
The NPC dialogue is absolutely top notch.
---
Then it's not relevant to the saga, I guess.
---
I'm SHOOK
---
No legendary weapon, no raid, no fractal.
---
Omg Emotes and hairstyles. True end game !
---
Depends on you. Ive put alot of time in both, GW2 is more fun to me because of gliding/jumping and the combat. FF has fun stuff like job switching, chocobos and moogles. Try it out
---
I don't think anyone questioned the quality of the Living World releases during the controversies. Yes, replayability is a problem, as is the nature of the experience; which is far above average, considering who they cater to with it.
---
The problem is the game desperately needs "expansion features" such as elite specializations, and there are no signals of those happening any soon.
---
No dishonor but lost ranking.
---
Thanks :)
---
Great, thank you!
---
where do u see male subligar in gw2??
---
Agree, hope Jormag remains as a secondary thing and we get to focus on mortal characters for a change.
---
Anet, don't do this, don't give me hope that we'll see the Leviathans after they appeared only in the manifesto.
---
All my characters are the same race, problem solved :)
---
Olé
---
Hands down the best part of this Prologue.
---
NORNS ARE THE BEST AND I’M SO PUMPED HECK YEEEEAAHHHHHHH
---
I wouldn't have minded hearts as long as they could be completed easily by just doing the events on schedule.
---
my pleasure ;)
---
That's what I'm saying. I don't like it "whooshy". I prefer control to speed.
---
Yap just finished a game where everybody crashed 5+ times.
---
I hope this is a teaser for a new Side Stories to come, and not some sort of closure :I.
---
Always one mouth breather here to try and shit in the well. Go back under your bridge, trundle.
---
uh oh HE GON' GETCHA!
---
Knew it. Either we're getting ready for GW3, or maybe it will be used for story. Or both.
---
I'm crashing hard as well. Guess it's time for me to find a new game to play while they take a month to figure out the problem.
---
But there's already Power Daredevil. 1111111111.
---
I mean, being lesser than a story dungeon is kinda sad though. Lesser than a t1 fractal.
---
People are almost always pleased with the episode releases. The real complaining starts a couple of weeks in, no matter how good the release is. (Personally, I really enjoy this release, but then I also really enjoy the story in general.)
---
Yeah it's a bit distracting to me. There are dozens of charr who sound like Braham now, it's been going on since PoF (maybe even before). I wish they brought back some of the original charr voice actors from the core zones, or at least diversify a bit.
---
It's just a client crash(in wvw players keep crashing, but server keeps running), so it has nothing todo with server resources.
---
can't you just let people complain about it? why do you feel the need to censor peoples opinions?
---
3rd time crashed on EBG while in combat
---
Yet when you set up GW2 to play itself, they ban you for botting!
---
WTF, ANet. Pick one!
---
Still love that WP beat the core story without using heal skills, dodges or weapons. Just... what a joke.
---
I'm happy that I'm not under constant attack every 2 steps and that we're not being forced to do hearts.
---
This is pretty typical, and one reason why I keep saying their project management is so poor. They clearly don't document design errors that should be avoided by all teams.
---
I'm expecting a 30 second record speed kill.
---
Looking forward to the videos.
---
Yup
---
That's 11 mystic coins too much.
---
Exactly what i was thinking when i saw this, "didn they mention this when PoF launched and they talked about the griffon"
---
Had that happen to me when I played warrior in fractals. Didn't always get the timing right but it's been possible.
---
250 stacks of each? Now now, that's a bit excessive.
---
Twas just a tongue and cheek question ^/s related to the state of PvP/WvW.
---
You can actually get 1, 2 or 6 it seems.
---
Does it even scale from 5-10?
---
Would be okay if it was easy, but taught different mechanics...but you can just stand and beat on it...
---
Sorry, responding on a phone. I meant that you *can't* train masteries without mastery points.
---
On Clorr Island? Or wandering around as a Risen somewhere at the bottom of the ocean?
---
Looks like they remembered the [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder) exists and put the torch mechanic in. So we have to complete the JP like in the 'Old Days'.
---
I’m such a GW2 noob so I have no idea what any of this episode business is about... but is it something that’ll remain in the game forever or is it a limited time?
---
[Confirmed.](https://youtu.be/ktmuATaBheo?t=14)
---
Although this one is a bit less exciting.
---
So what happens if you come along later, and miss the first times when it was weaker?
---
Like I mean, if you are a new player that encounters this when its mega hard, whats the point?
---
It is..not the same thing mainly due to how big the difference is in time. Spirit took close to 3s to use the ability and it is a secondary source (in pvp, you can interrupt the spirit's cast for example.)
---
This requires you to get down between a much much shorter time (banner cast -&gt; banner hits ground) and it cannot be interrupted in any other form once the banner is cast.
---
is this the work of an enemy stand?
---
I have to agree, it also explains why he said we mentioned 97 when we never did. Because he heard us mention 97 right at this point in time. This is most definitely the origin of his mist adventures, and we ironically caused it. Stable Time Loop anybody?
---
"We will fix it later, just trust us" isn't a great stance to go with as anet :p
---
ff14 doesnt have bunny boys
---
bruh, anet is in Seattle Washington, US, its not 2 am there.
---
They changed the ears that they took off the shrine guardian outfit. Now it has a big ass headpiece
---
Well, have you contacted support and asked? It's maybe unlikely, but they might be willing to regive them to you if you prove you're destroying them.
---
It's not just pvp, wvw as well.
---
it's a major landmark from GW1:EotN. I'm happy how it's still a monument; just one of peace n quiet instead of future threats.
---
thats what we are aiming for to hope ppl start a leaderboard for it
---
I'm running on Linux, too, but it does sound like it's server side
---
except those tree physics...now sure who goes around oiling up those branches, but we need to stop them &gt;.&gt;
---
just had 2 crashes, got a desertion even though I was there for the end, lost rating and wont be playing until this is fixed.
---
Or try to do Southsun Survival
---
I mean, this isn't Eve. I don't expect people in this community to shout "Harden The Fuck Up" or "Get Fucked" when I realize there was not information made apparent. I'm not denouncing the game, mind you you. Just lamenting over the fact that I have missed out on resources I didn't know I was otherwise entitled to because I was unaware of how an in-game feature worked. If there was some take away here, I'd ask for more information be presented in-game.
---
Well...
---
Maybe I’m alone in this, but I wish the PoI was available without going through all this trouble. It’s one thing to lock achievements and lore and whatnot behind some bizarre puzzle, but something as trivial as map completion? Especially when gaining access to the PoI is fairly obscure.
---
That they are braindead
---
"Who's Rox?"
---
i mean i agree but they have already done this in the past with thunderhead peaks :/
---
&gt; still salty, all we got was “everything is on the table” and funko pops.
---
Yes. You are a huuuuuge fan of funkopops.
---
I got mine but the sequences and the tree location changed.
---
Did you bother to go to the cathedral of flames/doomlore shrine? It’s literally the same without a fence and NPCs....
---
Ah, I see. I though they were open world things. But if they are in an instance, that could work like you said.
---
It IS wack. Tried to get a refund recently, hours after the purchase, basically told they can't because they can't reverse the unlock. 
---
I'm pretty sure this is both illegal and unethical by all standard business practices and laws - There's just a bullshit distinction between digital and non-digital currently.
---
Yeah, unfortunately.
---
They should have an item that summons Metal Legion once enough people interact with it.  I wanna do Tequatl with them.
---
I got all the feels. Well done, anet. &lt;3
---
I've crashed several times in pvp - matches and in the lobby. Says something about addons or something
---
I'm getting non-stop crashing when I try to log in as well. I've given up for tonight and will have to check back in the next few days to see if they've fixed it.
---
Crashing like craaaazy. Instance wont let me in either. I was gonna report it.. but I crashed.
---
The absurd thing is they keep claiming people who continue to happily play GW2 will be surprised pikachu face when they all leave for FF14 or WoW Classic but I doubt even ArenaNet would miss them the way they try to make everyone else miserable like them.
---
It's not an episode - its only a prologue.
---
&gt; Now it's already irrelevant.
---
LOL. No it's not. Most people haven't played the content yet.
---
Same, I love ash legion. It’s about time!
---
"If Mordremoth can attack the Mother Tree in the Grove, it can attack anywhere" - Emmy award winning Sam Riegel
---
Tried to play the freaking story instance twice now.. got kicked out on character select and not finishing the story. Fun stuff.
---
Considering the data that Mike Z dropped in that interview I mentioned, many casual players do about 10% DPS of raiders. So, we have to imagine how tough this boss if you're doing 2-3k DPS with a bad team comp and learning the mechanics. 
---
It's hard to compare it directly to T1 fractals. It's really apples to oranges.
---
I generally agree, but I think there’s a distinction to be made. If I can see a blank PoI on the map, I personally feel I should be able to access it then and there with not much fuss.
---
However, there’s a vista in the cavern of the Khan-Ur or whatever. You can’t see the vista on the map until you’ve actually unlocked the door with the four keys. In that case, you know there is a vista in that area, but the mystery is now about how to access the “fogged” area of the map.
---
That’s how I see it, anyway.
---
&gt; This map is nice but isn’t repeatable
---
It's very likely we will be returning to the map later in the saga.
---
Doesn't mean next episode can't spend time in Grothmar. They can have story steps in both the Shiverpeaks and the Blood Legion Citadel.
---
the bangs look really weird..
---
Use dx12 plugin it gives bug fps increase. I can finally run gw2 on high in pve.
---
The point is that it's really easy to the point where you barely have to move at all or even do a rotation.
---
Take a waypoint, or buy the portal scroll while you're in the zone.
---
I can't seem to way point or travel into an instance without crashing post most recent patch.
---
Only if you don't log in
---
Warbeast armor has a few nods to him, too, as does the tier uh 3 human? Seraph armor.
---
Oh, that explains why it was a breeze to move from event to event, explore the map, take in the scenery, etc. Seriously, more maps should have areas like this. Sure there are mobs, but they are only there when events are triggered, and it's perfect. Not all maps should have mobs laying around just for the sake of it...
---
So far, the map is great, some of the events are interesting, but yeah, the replayability might be limited and the strike missions seems utterly useless.
---
There's 2 events that happens on day-cycle, the Concert and the Effigy event, the Concert always happens at Sundown in-game, while the Effigy always happens at Midnight in-game
---
there are more than 4 trees with carvings around the place (found at least 6), you just need to find the right symbols for the day
---
Crash log shows that the game is having problems loading textures. In addition to this, it can’t find animations for certain skills, resulting in these strange crashes. Unfortunately, the log doesn’t show time stamps so I can’t tell if all the missing textures and animations are happening at once or building up over time and then causing a crash.
---
Dishonor and lost rating.  This happens in PvE areas as well, but I assumed it was just buggy events.  Looks like Anet has borked servers.
---
It changes daily
---
Hey, I've made a quick map with the location of the various markers, you can find it here:  
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/NhsNbLk.png](https://i.imgur.com/NhsNbLk.png)
---
I disagree. Plenty of other games have positive subreddits. The GW2 one is particularly negative.
---
Most materials and other junk I put on a bank toon(s) with 18 or 20 slot bags.
---
they look like clip-ons lol
---
I think it's the cutscene starting. I had my game go not responding for it as well but it didn't take as long to go responding again and give me the scene.
---
I had something similar happen in sandswept when you would talk to aurene there and get a cutscene. That time it took over 20 minutes to work, but I was on a laptop back then.
---
It’s happening in PvE as well. I read through the crash log and this is what I found:
---
I’m guessing that people are crashing more in competitive game modes due to the skill animation not being found, and since so many skills are being used consistently, it’s probably freaking the game out.
---
I am as well. This scares me because in the past when linux users have seen these types of crashes it takes anywhere from a day to a year to fix.
---
(I missed just about all of living story 1 because of it)
---
The concern was never for story-related content or new maps, ANet has excelled with that for years. There's more to the game than story.
---
I think this might be an old asset. I think I remember Demmi looking at it in an Order of Whispers Instance in base game. I think it just shows Orrian architecture and aquatic risen.
---
yeah,  Isaw the post about how they are carved in a Malice desk
---
I went and watched a movie and came back and sadly it was still stuck there D:
---
id totally bug weapon idles. something like greatsword over the shoulder (especially on charr and nord)
---
not p2w unless you compete in fashion. you have thousands of hours to play
---
Oh, thanks :D
---
Insane crashing...cant enter pvp lobby without crashing and cent remove my characters from it.
---
Couldn't watch it for that frickin annoying music.    Why not just blare a car horn, it's cheaper and just as effective?
---
Final round of supply drop stuff landed and I pulled all of the good stuff with 5 keys and a golden one.
---
Today is a good day, although this has made me dust off my ranger. Looks like BearBow's back on the menu.
---
whoa
---
Yes, but I'm not entirely certain it's exclusive to Linux. It only started happening after the most recent hotfix.
---
All those *voice acted* side conversations! They're all over the place. I can only imagine how much recorded dialogue they put into this prologue. It really adds to the feel of the map, I love it. ( And that metal concert, god damn. )
---
Not to mention how pretty it is, it's like Ascalon but with newer assets and a much more vibrant landscape.
---
I mean you character questions him and he's like "I guess I'm flame imperator then"
---
Hahahahaha, niiiice detail!
---
this is one of the few jokes posted on this channel that I legitimately liked and laughed at
---
From the very start I bound the dive/rise buttons to my mouse. Just remind them somewhere that's easy to access fast, and after that it's just some getting used to, and practice. I bound them to my Logitech G502's two buttons that are right on the side of the LMB.
---
I was so disappointed Marjory lost her voice character, also her voice is deeper and it sounds fake.
---
Where is Auris on the map?
---
Some redditors go mad about "fake leaks", but there was one mentioning a new mount like a mammoth. Maybe?
---
Yeah I need to know, too, lol
---
I can't disagree more.  Played with my crew for an hour today and finished the padding aka busy work of helping with the festival.
---
Spoiler the festival activities are hearts with the icons removed and long waits where you have to wait for every NPC for miles to walk up it feels like.  Helping pass out beer and cook are heart activities if I've ever seen.
---
We're gonna finish it up tomorrow but to hype up all this in a physical show to then start off with us having to do hearts broke me.  I can only assume it was padding and there's not hours of original content after this and fully expect to find that tomorrow.
---
If a new map that has you waiting around to do dynamic events that are on a timer now is all you could ask for I'm glad you're enjoying it but while I waited for the next event it only crushed me more.
---
Crashing constantly loading into game and trying to do Southsun survival. Don't get more than 3 minutes of gametime before the error reporter pops up.
---
amount of skins added ingame vs added to the gemstone is not even close to be even. one patch with a couple new skins doesnt outweight months without while they add 20 gemstore skins in that time
---
This hairstyle has existed in the game since, like, LS2. The norn with the bioluminescent armor by the entrance to Silverwastes has it. There's also an NPC in the Mistlock Sanctuary that has it, Mistwalker Ilia.
---
^This, it's not just our superior kernel having problems.
---
Most of it doenst bother me, as i know they are on a budget and trying to do it all with what they got. However, the Braham voice on Charr needs to stop: Makes it seem as though they have accidently got the races and their voices mixed up.
---
Taking into account how hard ANet can milk mounts, you can expect them to just add a cold-resistant mount.
---
There's no way they'll add actual locations where you can't mount up.
---
[The Shiverpeak mounts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shiverpeaks_Mount_Pack) are not impressed.
---
Crashed multiple times in LA and Southsun Survival daily so far
---
Every time I do the derby on the new map my client crashes. Also crashes in WvW.
---
Over twelve-million-lines of code in this game. You can be as ignorantly belligerent as you want. It will never change the fact that some issues are deeper and take more time than others.
---
The Elegy pants for light are pretty good, I actually prefer them to the Requiem ones and they aren't too hard to get.
---
Just attended the concert a few minutes ago and it's fucking amazing!
---
No P2W, just skins etc. The only thing you're "forced" to buy, not istantly... you can begin as f2p, is the Path of Fire xpac, which now includes also Heart of Thorns. There're also the Living story packages, which you can obtain for free in the timespan that the update is "new", but if you miss them, you have to buy them with gems. If you start now you will begin unlocking the first episode of the Living story 5 that just got released today, but LS2,3 and 4 will have to be bought. You're also not forced to buy them with cash. If you buy PoF you will unlock the possibility to trade gold to gems, so you will be able to buy them with in game gold.  
---
LS1 isn't currently replayable due to the structure of the season, but you can watch some recap videos if you're interested into the story.  
---
Story wise you will have to play stuff in this order Main campaign-&gt;LS1-&gt;LS2-&gt;HoT-&gt;LS3-&gt;PoF-&gt;LS4-&gt;LS5.
---
Population is fine, PvE content now gets updated, in theory, every month. Alternating a PvE story/content release with a recurring events like halloween, wintersday etc.  
---
PvP and WvW are pretty good, but they're feeling some "attention drought". Devs recently said that they're working on stuff for both modes, but the team/budget for them must be fairly thin, as they take quite a bit to release new stuff for said modes...that said they're both playable etc.
---
Checked fractals he isnt there, checked thaumanova 97 he aint there, checked old location he still in old form there, checked in the new map he is still gone and missing.
---
\#SaveAnomalies
---
Thats ANET for you....consistently inconsistent
---
not p2w,pvp is nice but hard to get into it as a new player,most best of best players left the game but a lot of casuals still here queue time 1-5min max, content and pve  is kinda nice personal story,fractals raid map completion
---
Same.  All Linux/WINE?  With d9vk?
---
I am enjoying the absolute SHIT out of this map. The convos, the music, the CONCERT- Braham being an absolute doof over the comm??
---
Fan-freakin-tastic. Thank you Anet! Turned a stressful day into a good one.
---
I uploaded a video to the OP if you want to take an actual look at it
---
Funny how the times have changed in the years since I was a regular. This used to be THE example of a good gaming sub.
---
He doesn't seem to recognize the device though if that were the case. 'Never seen anything like it before', 'Well, I don't know what a rift stabilizer is' are his answers about this at the Gillscale pond (presumably him in the future). Also doesn't explain why he changed his outfit all of a sudden (shouldn't he just be wearing his normal clothes at Gillscale pond as well?). Not to mention, we get Class II Rift Stabilizer from HIM when he fixes it for us in FoR. Unless it's some oversight from anet. Now I wonder what would happen if you bring Class I (1) Stabilizer or even Mysterious Device to him in Grothmar Valley. Perhaps worth investigating if he reacts differently to it.
---
I choked on water when I heard this the first time
---
2 could be Awakening. 3 should be Ashes Of History.
---
Does anyone know how to acquire the frying pan skin as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5jnhf/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_september/) At all? Or is it not yet obtainable?
---
I was ready to cringe at mention of them being a couple yet again, but there was not even a hint this episode, i'm really happy if we are going to see them as characters again, specially marjory as Noir detective
---
If you are on a character without Rift II Stabilizer he just walks around his workshop, doesn't react to you and goes on his own business.
---
If you are on a character with Rift II Stabilizer but don't talk with him, he just walks around.
---
After you talk to him and wait long enough (maybe 97 seconds? Didn't measure) at the broken portal with the Rift Stabilizer II equipped, stuff arounds starts expoding and all of a sudden Auris is POOF...gone.
---
Steve Blum is my favorite voice actor and his voice is in a LOT of games. Mostly as random henchmen, you hear him quite a bit in the Arkham games when fighting goons, but in Guild Wars 2 he plays Rytlock, as well as random soldiers and henchmen. He also has literally about 1000 more voice acting credits.
---
are you finding mounts effecting the crashing in wvw?
---
You are reading too much into it, he was always obsessed with bugs/arthropods.
---
The real reason they didn't use it is because the developers knew that people who fear spiders would not like the spider mount, that's it. But they ended up using the spider concept as boss for Fractal. They can still use the Spider mount concept someday.
---
Gonna get hate for this, but I'm inexplicably offended by these overly shiny, unique model skins casually added to gemstore like all others. So much wasted potential of making it an actual ingame reward and getting all the good publicity. Imagine your non-GW2 friends asking how you got it and you tell them about some challenge mote or lengthy meta achievement. Something to get them interested in the game maybe even. I doubt anyone new would wanna start playing just because we have 100+ gemstore mounts and none earnable through actual gameplay.
---
Ah sorry my bad. I probably shouldn't post today. Just back from the hospital and still too much medication in my system.
---
As far as patch notes, I don't think Anet is trying to use them to sell the game or expansion. They've based this game on exploration and not being spoonfed. People who play this often want to discover stuff on their own. Some people may want a list of everything available.  I don't.
---
Where is he by the stadium?
---
Yeah, you are correct. I meant, more like the idea behind how it works is the same. Like, if timed correctly both abilities will bring you back from a downed state.
---
Hahaha. Holy crap!!
---
Pretty sure that was just a reference back to S4 when we killed the spiders in Sun's Refuge and then he came in excited about a spider species that was thought to be extinct... That we just wiped out. So his datapad thing having drawings of what remained of them makes sense.
---
But it is always possible they could revisit the spider mount... Though we know the Saga Masteries are Spirits of the Wild so I wouldn't expect a new mount.
---

---
Crashed consistently including TWICE in PvP and 3x in that hot new prologue.
---
I'll come back in next week assuming someone calls the exterminator in to eradicate the bugs!
---
Parts of it look really nice, but I wish the entire map didn't perform like hot garbage.
---
Sylvari getting high on Miracle Gro...
---
I have crashed about 5 times in a row either running through Lions Arch, or while in or loading into the Southsun Survival activity. At this point I have elected to give up for the night and hope a patch comes out in the next day or two that fixes this.
---
I *think* The order is Bar Farm Ooze Concert, but at the very least those are the 4

Shoulders of the Ebon Vanguard Choice Chest only unlock the chosen one. You chose "heavy", and only heavy will unlock =(

I tried the solutions and they didn't work for me. Guess I need to try reinstalling the game.

I definitely passed by an NPC who just idly used ‘Bastard’ too like
---
I’m so glad the Charr are Rude.
---
Seems that the trees with which to interact change on a daily basis.
---
Thanks for your art, Dagos\~
---
Can’t play the game for more than 10 minutes. Constantly crashing on every map I go to.
---
Yeh nah I’m not going to the forums lol
---
is there a guide on how to unlock all mastery points while completing the living story??? Are most of them just unlocked completing the main story or is there a bunch of side stuff that you have to do?
---
You laugh, but you know not the sort of horrors you would unleash upon the RP world to officially have a confirmed charr x human relationship in canon.
---
Trash Assnet.
---
The strike mission was the only really exciting part about it. finding out that this 5-10 man encounter is so trivial that it can be soloed, or breezed through with a few teammates, put a dampener on that excitement real quick.
---
I opened a few instances shortly after release, the majority of people asked "that's it?" afterwards.
---
Well, prologue after all, let's see if they can deliver something with EP1.
---
You know what, I completely forgot about the spider infestation in Sun's Refuge. You're probably right, in that case.
---
I legit just want them to wander the area, holding random secret concerts at boss events so we'll have kick-ass music playing while we fight.
---
Hell yeah, I'm finally being catered to
---
Great.  
---

---
Thank you!
---
*laughs in healing gliph guardian*
---
They sell the helmets from the grenth and balthazaar outfits seperately too.
---
In the same place here with pve, in new content and old. Tried repairing files after a few times and that didn't help. Seems to be a common issue rn.
---
Well there's new 10-man repeatable content. It's very easy for the moment but the difficulty will increase with the next releases.
---
Idk, in my opinion the current teams are absolutely superb at making snowy areas. I mean just take a look at Bitterfrost Frontier or Thunderhead Peaks.
---
No since you can have the almost exact same sword as reward if you have enough points in the hall of monuments from gw1.
---
Well, I did strike mission and could not see ground in some parts.
---
Yep, looks like this is my problem. So it's a Windows bug that WINE is faithfully replicating... joy...
---
Just wanted to drop by and say a personal thanks. Your work is super appreciated!
---
I mean usually but why would i create worse food then considering carne khan chili is also 100 concentration, 70 expertise and 1% to all exp gained
---
I find the GW2 maps have more replayability / repeatable content than dungeons in their competitors like FFXIV and wow
---
I just crashed simply teleporting to the Black Citadel. Nothing to do with PvP or WvW.
---
The demand says 22 g. Plus this post (if viewed enough) will cause the price to plummet
---
They're all crashing for you?
---
Smodur was done by Liam O'Brien as it always has. Sam is doing half of the male VA and Liam is doing other half. :D Or it felt to be like that before PoF, now it's more of Sam and new VA with less Liam.
---
Me as well! In a ranked pvp match, crashed 5 times in that 1 match. And it happened to at least 1 other (a teammate) in that match as well. This has never happened to me before this recent update.
---
On a separate occasion today, my wife also experienced the same crashes in WvW when she was fighting enemies.
---
&gt; Converting the t5 mats to t6, buying legendary components, crafting it all together, doing clovers etc is a further 2 hours
---
If anyone is going to do that they might as well just do the conversion step and sell t6s ...
---
In a different post, others have also commented that they experienced crashes in story instances and simply teleporting into Black Citadel as well.
---
Ahh, if only I had more spare PvP/WvW potions.
---
The prologue was actually pretty good.  This post is unfair.
---
That's what I'm trying to get at. There are better ways to spend your time/shards. There is some demand nuances to go along with this but there are plenty of better ways to use spirit shards listed on gw2efficiency...
---
that reminds me, there are the two weapons that reflects the game UI XD
---
Yes, there are about 10 posts related to the crashes on this sub right now.
---
Your flair is oddly appropriate
---
No and no.
---
Plus the Fiery Dragon Sword exists.
---
Just to make sure but are you testing with sound on?
---
believe you me, i am trying.
---
On the stance as a spectater. In the middle and lower seats.
---
I'd rate it 4 man level 20 story ifrit.
---
&gt; I notice all our activities are competitive player vs player activities, OP. Wonder if there's a connection.
---
After 2nd update I crashed many times in PvE as well.
---
Am I the only one bothered that in way too many places I hear Brahm as charr VO? Soo many resued actors breaks immersion a bit.
---
It just crashed again.
---
it appears to be completely gone so support ticket it is
---
[removed]
---
I have played the story from my sylvari and human, can someone confirm if the dialogues are different for charr commanders?
---
oh no I'm saying thats why I dont delete the character.
---
Thanks for the information. Tbh this makes me not want to play the game anymore. Everything I try doing someone else does it better. Meh. It just makes me realize what a loser I am. Uninstalled.
---
heads up: d912pxy and arcdps are wigging the hell out with this recent hotfix
---
&gt; We ended up waiting 15  minutes to do the concert which was okay, the background music in Ffxiv  would blow it away, but it was enjoyable enough as an event.   
---
Nice try mate, now stop baiting
---
This place gives me Chrono Cross vibes.
---
&gt;Exploration is really hampered by the amount of invisible walls as well. 
---
 
---
Which probably means that they aren't done with the map yet and new areas will probably be added in later episodes.
---
Eh... yes. I think everybody ingame see this message and everybody not ingame will see the update when he starts the game...
---
they always wig out on patch day; don't they?
---
Oh thank God for this crash fix.
---
I'll tell you this: don't plan on getting buddy buddy with Flame Legion.
---
They have been for all intents and purposes an enemy faction. I see no reason why suddenly they are our allies.
---
A video/picture would be much appreciated.
---
I haven't sold a map completion but have done a bunch of conversions. All mats are provided, you are just spending your time and shards. For people that have low Magic Find, they are provided ecto to salvage to keep the luck and send back the dust. If you aren't going to be using your shards or have a glut of them, it is pretty easy gold to make.
---
I think many viewers watching the video can feel something veiled but your post clearly explains it with numbers. You can see throughout the comments and woodenpotatoes’ own uncertain tone when they try to convince him by repetitively saying “Right? Right?” and cleverly dodging real questions with unsubstantial fluff. The whole conversation had a “the wolf of Wall Street” vibe to it. 
---
As you have shown, it is better to just play the game normally rather than doing the most mind numbing activities controlled by these market manipulators. They heavily emphasize how little power they have and how these activities’ goal is to benefit everyone. How benevolent of them.
---
I managed to get it running, updated my lutris runtime, updated dxvk, whipped out my cache and just let the game keep crashing over and over again (I used a character in Hoelbrak for this, crystal oasis wouldn't work). and the game worked after about 4/5 tries, and its running fine again.
---
That soon? Right-click, sell for a hefty price.
---
Lol I wanted to delete my other characters and create nothing but chars so i mosh with by bro's. This was a great, light-hearted event.
---
Ok redditor for 7 minutes
---
I am not but... That seems like a pretty steep price to add an audio effect.
---
P2w incoming kapp :)
---
We can accept our fate or defy it. But we can NOT deny it.
---
Imagine being too busy to write "bye I'm out"
---
i've checked all the map for 2 things .. 1. Auris, 2. Rifts,
---
Yet i havent found none of those 2.
---
He must either be timegated for sure or else in another world, ive looked everywhere, fractals, LA, old place, new place, u name it. Also checked all port locations even the inactive ones didnt find anything new but the same old .
---
It's the same as other LS4 maps in this regard.
---
i did talk to auris back in the fields afterwards and there is nothing new to that, it is still the old verison of him saying the same ninety-seven thing .
---
This was a pretty great patch. The story was pretty good, this is probably one of the best looking maps Anet has put in the game yet, and the introduction of more emotes makes me hopeful Anet can provide more customization content. I feel like down the pipe strike missions can be pretty good, even the fact that have an auto join public queue system excites me to see what they'll do with it in the future.
---
I did, but the dialogue of FoR Auris did not change (still the same one after getting Rift 2 Stabilizer).
---
What is interesting is that Rift 2 Stabilizer is still in your inventory (not destroyed) and can still be used after talking to GV Auris, so perhaps it is still possible to do smth with it.
---
It is like they focused on fun instead of trying to prove something.
---
I love the open map that is not an annoying maze.  I greatly appreciate the reduced the volume of mobs using crowd control.
---
Bonus points if you're Ash Legion, since you're probably thinking "Oh Jory, there's definitely a hidden base here you don't know about..." I love how the Commander acts like it's nothing special when they find the base, but is surprised Marjory did. It's like..."Wait a minute...I'm Ash, so finding this was nothing. But how did YOU find it?"
---
Strikes are 5man as well.
---
me thinks well have something thats cold oriented since you cant mount in the shiverpeaks part
---
I actually do! It's my solo guild's hall.
---
That makes no sense, who cares what you look like....
---
Thank you!!
---
Is the prologue or anything in it time gated IRL ala Season 1?
---
Didn't Anet themselves call it a mini release? Augh. Can someone confirm?
---
That reward structure is a big part of the reason I've mostly stopped playing.
---
Or he thinks of Rox as a sister.
---
every game? our whole reallife consists of that
---
Yeah it's fun! Been trying it out for a while, both games have their strong/weak points. 
---
Story:
---
FF14 is all about the main story quest, the writing is really, really, REALLY good. But it feels more like watching an anime (which is not always voiced) instead of actually playing a game, compared with post Zhaitan personal story. If that makes sense.
---
QOL:
---
GW2 is truly the king of QOL. Sure, we could use build templates, but our bank/material/TP/dye/wardrobe system is way too under appreciated. That said, FF14 has a better crafting/gathering system, and is more "farm the material itself" than "farm the gold to buy the material". If only we could have the best of both worlds :(
---
Movement/Mounts:
---
This is probably personal preference but GW2 nailed the "joy of movement" with mounts. FF14 mounts are all just different skins, but they have double seated mounts and you get skins through basic game play (to be fair, there's a sub). Overall, player movement is smoother in GW2. FF14 tries to put in some "jumping challenges" here and there but... nope. Not even close.
---
Open world PVE:
---
Dynamic events over FATE/fetch quests, all day every day. And I miss all the ambient NPC chatter in the background when I'm in Eorzea. How will I ever know that Mordremoth can attack anywhere if everything is so darn quiet?!
---
Instanced PVE:
---
This is where FF14 shines. I don't really do dungeons/fractals/raids in GW2, but they are mandatory for clearing the MSQ in FF14, and the game makes it really accessible for casual players. I don't understand the mentality of "easy story raid mode is bad for the game", it's quite the opposite.
---
Alt friendliness:
---
I'm conflicted on this one. FF14 is designed so that you can easily have all classes on the same character, with race/gender change via cash shop. GW2 is designed so that you can easily have different characters and share stuff across the same account. If you like to have different looking characters, then GW2 is more altaholic friendly. If you only care about playing different roles, then FF14 is friendlier in that aspect.
---
Gear grind:
---
I went in FF14 expecting the notorious "MMO gear grind", but the game actually throws level appropriate gear at you. It was surprisingly not a big deal at all. Level cap only rises every few years, that also feels reasonable to me. They have the holy trinity so stats/rotations are all streamlined though, if you like making crazy builds there isn't much freedom there (e.g., every max leveled BiS warrior will be more or less the same).
---
Or you spend a while in PvP/WvW, since the reward track gives it as well.
---
Ouch
---
I’ll pass, Arenanet’s shitty announcement event and subsequent failure to address fan concerns soured any hope I ever had in this game.
---
Oh, it's just 100?  Derp, for some reason I thought it was 250 or 500, must've been mixing it up with another achievement.
---
Well people (like me) wanna know if its even worth logging in for. Because we can't use this subreddit for feedback because fanboys are overhyping and haters are underhyping. So we read the patch notes and see nothing aside real money stuff ofcourse i'll be dissapointed and won't bother logging in for that. Regardless if the "prologue" is any good because I know I would be done with it after a day or two.
---
K
---
i will be so pissed....
---
/r/guildwarsgonewild
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I agree. It’s beautiful and a cool exploration map. It will all depend though when they release the next actual map. This is not a repeatable farm map, so if they expect Halloween farming to hold all players over until November, I think even die hard fans like me are going to start looking elsewhere for something to do.
---
It was so unexpectedly satisfying to finally have my Ash Legion background matter. Iron and Blood have been the only ones that mattered anywhere for so long.
---
True, but there's been like 5 metas since PoF.
---
I'm hoping it comes up more often. I'd also like some of our other choices to come up a bit...even if it's just a letter from our Warband and our father (if he's alive).
---
To all of you who say that buttcapes are an "engine problem" and not a "design problem" (I've seen many claim this for ages), Looks like it wasn't an "engine problem".
---
This is just from the chat code or bag preview
---
Can I ask: how do you know how long you can fly before you need to pull up to take more speed? I always end up landing when I try stuff like this...
---
Whoa, it's almost like different people have different opinions. They also might want an introduction to raids to be successful instead of soloable and all mechanics ignorable so you really learn nothing from it.
---
Yo my boss makes more money than I do and she gets to sit in either her office all day long, and I do boring repetitive tasks sometimes but I wouldn't say she's ***scamming*** me.
---
@purple\_hurricane
---
it always been possible to do something with it, opening rifts and using it as a teleport device at it actually is, why should it be broken or destroyed when it is a useful tool to get at the end of a jp and many other locations.
---
This is how it starts.
---
It was ~850mb for me too. Language doesn't matter, the game downloads all of them regardless.
---
We already borrowed it
---
I'm just saying, maybe if you contact support and tell them "I want to change the race on this character and I'll delete them and remake them but I haven't because of these account bound bag slots... if I destroy the character would you be able to give me the slots new again for my new character?" They might say no, but they might do it.
---
More actually.  2 in Palawadan, 2 in Sandswept alone.  It's not that cut and dried.
---
I see the comment 2 hours of content every 4 months. I see it over and over again.  That 2 hours of content usually lasts me at least weeks if not longer. There is more than 1 side to this story. That's all I'm saying.
---
I have commented on the basic process of conversions for their operation. I must note that the "handler" that works with my guild gives a legendary with a certain amount of conversions. Though I am not certain this is a widespread policy, I am reasonably sure it is commonplace.
---
It's called repeatable content.
---
Calling it a scam is a bit off the mark. Yes they gain more than I will, but I know that going in. My boss gains more from my labour every day than he's paying me for doing it, otherwise I wouldn't be getting paid for it. 
---
As it stands, if you aren't already a trade baron with tens of thousands of gold at your disposal, you'd never be able to tap into the kind of profit that these guys will make from your shards/gift. So it's hardly like they're robbing players of their own opportunity to make massive profit from their shards, cause 99.97% of the population simply don't have the capital to do that in the first place, you know? 
---
It's a fair exchange from where I'm standing. Yes they profit, I'm fine with that. I profit too, significantly less for damn sure, there's no contesting that, but I still profit somewhat.
---
If you've played the story it actually tells you that the flame legion we see is actually just a section of it that wants to unite once more and make amends to the other legions. At least, that is the impression I got when the commander is conversing with lead the Flame Legion representative.
---
Here's a simple solution, be "they". You already know how *they* do it, so why would you be a spirit shard farmer? Just BUY the spirit shards from other people and flip the legendaries like they do. They even discuss in the discord how farming world comp isn't recommended, but rather the idea is to supplement your typical farms and what you are already doing to make money/playing the game. "Did you already DO map completion and you don't plan to make a second legendary? You can sell it instead." looking to find a use for your spirit shards? Either hold on to them and use them to discount a legendary or you can sell them. Don't want to do all that clicking? Buy the spirit shards off other people just like the do. This isn't a mystery.
---
ah true. worth a shot. good suggestion.
---
Same crashing issue, probably related to any implementation of PvP. The Demolition Derby on the new map and Southsun Survival were what triggered the crashing for me, on OS X (not updated to 10.15 yet)
---
My guildies and I gave up after several crashes. Had this hit an hour ago, we may have logged back in.
---
If they write fanfiction  about it then it is canon.
---
my twin had so much fun doing this meta, she recorded this while doing it at the same time and also split them if anyone wants them:
---
[Fear the Metal Legion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaTGSqCWEV0)
---
[Bound by Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlQlCOv0S-g)
---
[Ballad of Soulkeeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlWxNusM81Y)
---
I apologize if the quality isn't that HQ to some here, she did the best she could and enjoy the music GW2 had put up for the new map!
---
&gt; And they don’t even have to play the game… 
---
They have to spend hours and hours making deals with people, spreadsheeting it all, keeping up with messaging and on and on and on.  They're not doing "nothing" they're doing a desk job while you go out and do the manual labor.
---
I don't understand why people are so butthurt about this. They have been transparent about the details and have clearly stated they make more than the people selling their shards to them anf if you want a quick buck you can do that or if you want long term profit do like them. They have explained pretty clearly how the economy works with the gold cap and using legendaries or other valuable items as trading chips... Posts like these in my opinion are made by either people who disagree with everthing but their way or sleazy people that want to keep their "edge" over other less informed players.
---
Not only this. No new season currency and mostly old assets suggest icebrood saga will be extended copy paste of previous content.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Yeah, that was my selfie screenshot.
---
I think the scarcity of VM on the new map might have to do with the fact that accounts without PoF can also play the prologue, which wasnt the case for LW4 episodes.
---
mobz in dragonfall gona kill you in 3 sec.
---
I am really madly in love with the design they chose for Aurene’s branding. The opal-like effect is *so* cool. I really hope we get weapons skins inspired by these crystals.
---
Goddam freaking 1%. Always at it even in games.
---
I was impressed woth the writing. I was so interested, i cant wait till the next release to see what happens next. I was truly impressed.
---
Yeah, but when the food with the second heaviest requirements only uses 5 beans, the disparity is pretty funny.  Most of the stuff that uses kidney beans only uses 1 bean, outrider stew and bowl of sweet and spicy beans are the only ones that don't, and they use 3 and 5 kidney beans respectively.
---
You noticed it too? Our voice sounds...lackluster this time around.
---
Its cool first few times, will become boring pretty fast. Change my mind.
---
I knew it was coming out. I didn't know when. The only reason I knew was someone on a Discord I'm in mentioned it. That prompted me to log in.
---
The music tho
---
(#s “a pact crate on the cart behind her occasionally opens with something peeking out”)
---
I don't get it, something to do with the new story?
---
Agree on the essence part. For very new player it is a cheap way to get high to higher mf values quite quickly. If for myself have not even factored that in because I am at cap for years now. But I know ppl who are actively spending gold to get near 300%.
---
yeah, not so much a scam as "basic capitalism".  Employer pays for your labor, sells the product and makes a margin of profit... no more of a "scam" than your average day job.
---
sounds like an MLM
---
Dunno, sounds like cheap wannabe metal most games diw when trying to be metal. Blind Guardian quest with concert as a reward in Sacred 2 I liked more
---
Not only games... what takes a dark dark turn.
---
Hope someone does a video of the fastest solos or duos.
---
Where's the Mandragors? :(
---
They made FOTM for people who were calling for vertical progression at launch, hence the whole Agony resistance that gets progressively higher at higher levels and for which you had to gear up in full ascended AND farm and slot ever higher levels of agony resistance per character. Are you going to argue Gw2 vertical progression was the bulk of the game too?  
---
Raids were not introduced until the first expansion, 3 years after release and their addition was a controversial. A lot of people saw it as anet betraying the original design. I am not making this is up this happened, it was so bad woodenpotatoes even made a video about it called "Guild wars 2 didnt bait &amp; switch you with raids"
---
Look Gw2 is an MMO like any MMO it has to cater to different players, some love the open world some love dungeons and raids. No ofcourse it would be wrong to claim "Gw2 was always an open world story filled casual game" but it is true that Gw2 was always mainly about the open world story content. When going through hard times and we do know they're going through a hard time, it is likely your periphery going to suffer. And btw its not like Anet just hate people who are into instanced hard content the reason why its not the main focus is likely because it has a lower number of players then open world, anet arent stupid they're not going to shoot themselves in the foot by focusing the bulk of their effort on the content least played. 
---
And btw the last raid was released June 11 2019 thats  less then 3 months ago so even if you choose to totally ignore the bulk of the game how is it a content drought?
---
in direct comparsion to dragonfall,this map is pure trash,sorry. no concent,no armor sets,basicly 5 mobs on map,every event on timer,map is too big and feels empty asf. not even gona metion trash events like *throw me right ingredients/drink. im a fcking COMMANDER which killed  50 dragons and one god,not servant.
---
Not THE Sohothin, but A Sohothin. 
---
Same happens with other lore-themed weapons like the Shining Blade and the  Claw of the Khan-Ur. Even if we crafted them with the same exact method that made the original, we would still not have the original, just something quite close.
---
And do not forget we get them from the Mystic Forge.  
---
I would not be surprised if Zommoros was using that cauldron of his to scavenge Tyrias from alternate realities in which we didn't stop [the end of the world](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/a5/Harbinger_of_Woe_texture_1.jpg), and getting the weapons from those, essentially bringing us the exact same weapon, but from another dimension.
---
[Stupid Spoiler Tag on phones](#s "A pact crate on the cart behind her")
---
I was thinking the same thing. What Charr has OP been around? He'll I hated Charr until I met Tybalt. Then I just went to hating most of them.
---
Don't think you understood the point of this post mate.
---
Same thing with the metal legion concert. There's a huge stream of NPCs running home afterward.
---
Not to say that the cut the traders make is reasonable for the effort (I don't know how much work goes into it), the profit they make is derived from the value they add by organising the system, giving people a market to sell things they have too much of and want to offload without going through all the trouble themselves, circumventing TP taxes, etc. 
---
As in, they have done something a bit more than sit and afk to generate this money, some effort was involved (although again, how much I don't know). This is more a case of "if you don't want to go to the trouble of doing all of this yourself, you can just go through us instead and we'll provide another way to make money". And plus, if it was really that easy then you should see soon enough people doing it themselves at a better conversion rate.
---
I've done this, or at least something like it, before a while back. I guess I got lucky because I was provided with the t6 mats and any non-soulbound items I would need for the various gifts. As a long time player I had the more time consuming components just sitting around gathering dust (gift of battle/exploration and clovers). I got to keep the mystic coins they had sent me for making the clovers, so that was pretty nice and added to the gold I would be making from the deal anyway.
---
But yeah, in the end I probably didn't make near the same amount as the person I did this for. But I wanted some quick gold to fund armor swaps and my cosmetics addiction. I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't have stuff sitting around already or to anyone without a lot of free time.
---
Not the best but it’s fun and something different
---
&gt; They also might want an introduction to raids to be successful instead of soloable and all mechanics ignorable so you really learn nothing from it.
---
There are players who aren't even able to do story alone. It's not wrong to start at the level this first strike mission is.
---
I recall them being extremely specific on PoF being required for the prologue, but not as much for the rest of the saga. Who knows.
---
I actually met one of those guys on an istan farm before it was nerfed.
---
He gave us a very similar speech on discord.
---
Hes a nice dude. Really knows his shit.
---
Plenty of people function fairly in a capitalist system.  No-one has a problem with someone making money, but when you are massively underpaying someone by tricking them into thinking they are making money, then it becomes a problem.
---
It's like an 18 year old buying $100 value Pokemon cards off of his 10 year old brother's friends for only a couple of dollars.
---
This makes me wonder if people are here to play a game or run a company.. good for them honestly but I wouldn’t give a crap since Im here to enjoy a game, not look at numbers all day and sit in mistlock 24/7.
---
Id say something long and drawn out but honestly, just same. It was so hectic and fun and kept me interested the entire time. Incredible job, devs!
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
---
Thank you! This is a scandal!
---
I have a strong feeling that expansion will follow Icebrood Saga. Since we know how the story will go now, it feels like a prelude to awaken and fight Jormag.
---
I mean I was. I'm probably gonna get beat down for this but I've always hated the mockery of the militaristic fanatics the charr have been getting for a while now, rock concerts? Stupid ass punk hairstyles? God damn motorcycle references? Yeesh.
---
Thank you so much, Bangar's wife &lt;3
---
Mate the strikes are meant to be an introduction to raiding. They explicitly said so. They need a slight tune-up if they're going to teach people how a raid works. If they gradually add on difficulty with every patch then yeah it works as a slow ramping intro, but if *all* the strikes are easy then this isn't an introduction, it's completely different content. People don't want harder strikes because 'fuck the casuls lamao', they want them to be a little tougher so that they achieve their stated goal of being a stepping stone into raids, and bring more casual players into the raid scene.
---
Same!
---
Indeed but in skill based games you just need to train and outwit your opponents. Even with no talent, and only dedication you can be competitive in the top 15-20% players. Talking about games like Dota, Starcraft, CS GO, Age of Empires. You need to train and no scam or shady business is going to instantly make you a better player.
---
Here you need thousands of connections and huge opportunities to achieve even a decent level of wealth. You can't even farm for it like in other mmorpgs because the farm is nerfed into oblivion, compared to WoW where many players get enough gold to buy subscriptions with it. This is what is disgustingly offputting, even for me. There is no way for a player that, let's say is between casual and hardcore to get huge amounts of gold by actually playing the game....... you need to flip, you need to be a broker, you need GW2 to be a second job...
---
I got to admit. This is the only thing I hate most about this game. Ofc they don't allow gold farming in order to control the economy and make gems to gold viable... 
---
Nowdays I have a high paying job so I just dump some gems if I really need the gold, otherwise just enjoying the game.
---
Tl;Dr: Games capped by skill offer no shortcuts and no tricks to getting better, while GW2 even when compared to other mmorpgs, gives players no decent way of farming gold by playing the game's own content, forcing them to resort to gimmicks and advanced economics, which kill the fun. The actual content is fun, enjoyable with a solid story and best graphics within the genre, but not rewarded in any way.
---
yeah, like... obviously they are making a profit...
---
if you are from planet earth, why would you need that explained to you?
---
do these people think that when they go into work they are being scammed? (i mean they are but that's not a common political opinion)
---
The content delivery is different to the living story episodes and maybe it will enable them to extend the 'saga' beyond 6 episodes. The ice brood saga will have less maps which will hopefully enable them to focus in on the actual content within the maps better. Time will tell.
---
What is a charr's lifespan?
---
Yeah, but now they use it to a supporting character (not just the ambient one) to tease my Commander right to her face &gt;.&lt;
---
Releases are more than just the map, I'm talking about the story.
---
they very clearly explained in the video how they go about making their high profits from these trades. it's not like the video was telling you the only way to make gold is to sell your shards at a price they set and refusing to tell you what they do with it.
---
no idea why you bothered to make this post. it's not any more of a scam than basic capitalism. you can consider it unethical, but the fact is for someone who does not have enough capital to do what they do and who has a lot of these mats and currency lying around, (i.e who the video is aimed to and the vast majority of players,) then this is/was the best way to build up enough gold to start doing something like what they are doing. which they explain to you how to do.
---
why don't you use this rage at capitalism into the real world with something useful like volunteering at/donating to a soup-kitchen or something. there are people being hurt by more unscrupulous things economically and thats with real money!
---
&gt; CM Fractals are much better as introduction.
---
It's definitely not. CM fracs requires reasonable builds and group and knowledge of the bosses. It's literally the very end of 98 training steps. 
---
This strike mission is like Fractal lvl 1-10, but for raids. It's not about "doing everythign perfect" and definitely not about using the "optimal or almost just as viable" strat.
---
As a first step it's perfect to learn the mechanics **because** it's so forgiving. You can learn it without needing a full group with 2 healers every time and restarting after one mechanic/person fails.
---
I am not a member of that guild but what questions exactly did you think they dodged or would have a more specific answer to?
---
It's a nice change of pace. But I do hope we will go back to maps filled with danger.
---
it's the only world to be used in this situation, it's easy to come to the conclusion if you don't have a bias against the results of that conclusion due to other interests. my personal experiences are only with one avenue of gaining shards as it is the easiest way to get them. i was using my time in a non disingenuous way, you started this argument because it went against your personal interests, not because you actually think i'm wrong. more data would be nice but it is unnecessary, you are just being unreasonable.
---
I guess the point here in this case is that they sell it to you like it's a guide to making great riches, but in reality it's extremely tedious work, and you can basically make equivalent gold in better ways. The people making the big money here just want to lure people into their production chain.
---
The same goes to /u/Sylvia-Path. Isn't he/she entitled to their opinion that comments like this are annoying?
---
Everyone should do that tbh. Charr4lyfe. Iron legion best legion changemymind
---
Is it me or did they riff off of early Slayer?
---
Commander turning the charr into bookworms. One cub at a time.
---
Thats the crazy part to me. Sure the story was short, but the quality is unprecedented! Its obvious a lot of work went into this PROLOGUE!!
---
a full group with 2 healers? are pug raids really THAT bad?
---
Sorry, dropped an /s, thought it was too obvious.
---
I'm interested as well.
---
Well you dont have to deal with them as there are plenty of ways to make money aside from this
---
mmm &lt;3 i like this new saga.
---
Anet cant do storylines which are more than the basic disney plot, and the community is fine with that. Sadly, most of the players dont care fore intelligent writing. At least the presentation was good, bangar feels like a real creature (voicework, animations)
---
Some of them are, slightly.
---
Those players will never raid anyway. As an introduction to raids this is absolutely horrible.
---
Most of the data mined skins are usually not available immediately, but a few weeks after the patch.
---
Me as well. I had a few which stopped after I disabled arcdps.
---
Please see my answer above. OP can share their opinion all they want, but they should do it respectfully. There is a difference between saying that they have a problem with it and shitting on people for liking it.
---
Also, what's with Reddit's obsession with censorship? Me telling OP to shut up (which I did not) is not censorship, they can still share whatever they want, I won't be able to stop them. A mod deleting their comment and banning them for their negative opinion would be censorship.
---
Map complete can drop it.
---
Yup. It's neither punishing for individuals to fail mechanics, nor for the group. Thus, why would anyone actually do the mechanics?
---
And what does a new player do, when he want to do Fractal 99 and 100 CMs? He starts with T1 fracs. 
---
Raids only have T4 bosses. If you want to get into raids it's like starting at T4 Fractals. But *now* we got a "T1 raid boss" where people can start from the very start; and we get more difficult ones with future releases. So in the end we have a "stair" called strike missions that leads into raids. 
---
But this stair have to start with the first step, not with the 5th or 10th.
---
But... Are people actually doing this?
---
If it would be a training instance for mechanics, then it should be developed as one. Start in phase 1 with with some mechanics, adding more and more to it at certain boss health%. And as soon as phase 2 starts, make all of the mechanics punishing the player for not paying attention. Maybe even build in a score system like "Get hit by 5 mechanics will knock you in downstate no matter if you vuln or actually have health left after the hit".
---
This would train people to play mechanics. Right now, it just doubles down with the community raid meta of "We are pushing through mechanics anyways, so don't bother and just stay near the party for splash heals and buff sharing". That's not really training someone, that's showing them that mechanics will not matter. Not in this strike mission, and not later.
---
Yeah I would love to see that, I was just commenting on that in another thread today. I don't know why it bugs me, but it would feel satisfying to have this series of named volumes and not just some name, some arbitrarily numbered. Hell, Anet did go back and retroactively name the Guild Wars 1 base game to "Prophecies" to match up with the naming scheme of the rest of the campaigns. Speaking of which maybe the Zaitan campaign deserves a name better than personal story.
---
For season 2 my mind got stuck on the joke name Edge of Thorns and refuses to think up more. So have fun with that.
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
how was the story shorter exactly? took 6hrs for wooden potatoes to complete it in his stream.
---
Yeah, they need to implement difficulty and reward scaling (even copy pasta fotm system FFS) in strikes, it's a joke as it is now.
---
I've also seen some Blood Legion charr with helmets similar to the one in the middle, but rounder.
---
&gt; But... Are people actually doing this?
---
Sure, because most player just play the new content. some for the loot, most because it's new. 
---
People also do T1/2 fracs for loot, even though it's easy and less loot than T4.
---
its just LFR raids from WoW. no one is going to take it seriously or even want to do them after a month.
---
That's not what ANet says though. That's what you make from it.
---
Cute twink!
---
Oh I am itching to trim my armor with Charr fur and wear their horns in my helmet, they think we're clawless and furless Kodan.... Time to show them why the Charr lands never went beyond the shiverpeaks.
---
I do look at the "best way to learn" aspect. More than you think. But let me ask you directly. What do you think, this encounter will teach someone interested into raids?
---
Aside from "dodge mechanics". And I question even this exercise to be honest because there is no need to doge it.
---
Let's pick the encounter apart, shall we? What it teaches you because of it's mechanics:
---
* Always stay at the Boss. Doesn't matter what happens around you. If you go too far away, you will get damage.
---
* Constantly walk around. If you don't do it, you might get hit by AoE's or freez in place.
---
* Only use your dodge roll to dodge room wide AoE's. If you dodge other stuff, you will not have enough stamina to dodge the... "big" ones.
---
And that's it. Aside from the fact that you can simply decide if you want to do this or not because, again, it's not killing you if you don't do it, this is all the encounter teaches you. Dodging and staying stacked on the boss. Sooo... again... A basic Fractal boss.
---
&gt; No they dont. Escort, trio and MO are at most t2 difficulty. Then you have pre events which are basically t1.
---
If you really think so, you have a really distorted picture of T1, 2 and Fractals or always gotten caried through raids.
---
&gt; You sound like you haven't done any raiding.
---
I did, I'm working on my 4th legy armor on my main and the 1st on my alt account currently. 
---
But *you* sound like you haven't done T1-3 fracs for years, since you think they are as difficult as escort, trio an MO.
---
I was actually thinking it would slowly transition to blue along the way
---
What rebranding? Saga is in the title, this season is north centered and the heroic/legendari nordic tales are called sagas
---
You mean someone who is not familiar with the game ? or someone who knows the game but is on a break?
---
because lets see, someone who never played the game would skip the reveal that was advertise in most news sites, skip the teasers or the magazine, skip the trailer and just check out the patch notes. 
---
Someone who played the game before, knows the game, knows what to expect, again I dont see why they would skip all forms of reveal and just go for the patch notes, cant see why they wouldnt just log in and try it for themselves really!
---
But why are we arguing on this point its obviously disingenous like did we ever see anyone argue that FFXIV or WOW should save themselves a few millions by just ditching the trailers and focus on patch notes? No because no one gets hyped over patch notes, unless you're a die hard player who wants to know everything that changes in a game you likely dont even look at the patch notes!
---
"Man has always puzzled over his origin. His genesis. Created by God? Or a product of evolution? If we could see yesterday and tomorrow at the same time, the origin and the end,the entire universe in a single moment, we might finally find answers to the biggest questions of all. What is man? Where does he come from? What drives him? What is his purpose?"
---
I will be forever grateful that my legacy amounts to an ever increasing shitpost
---
I think it's because of Aurene's death everyone has gotten more adult, and Jory and Kas reflect that - they have grown up from teenagers to young adults.That's how I interpreted it.
---
This strike mission is not t1 raid, it's more like t-5
---
And where do those gems come from? Oh wait, they come from whales, feeding their gold addiction through buying gems to get gold. Driving prices of gems down, so more people come and convert gold to gems to drive prices back up, so more whales see the good price and spend more $$$$ on gems to gold.
---
(Not directed at you.) Why, Anet? Ponder this question... why are you taking anything from WoW? How about this, you guys level a character in World of Warcraft, and try not to gouge your eyes out. That's about the only challenge there. Who honestly looks at that kind of difficulty design and comes away saying it's a good idea? Oh, you didn't do that? Instead, you said WoW makes money, we want money; don't think about it-- just do it. Then you suspended the guy on your team who voiced the opinion I am now. YOU DON'T TAKE LESSONS FROM WOW. ON DIFFICULTY DESIGN. EVER.
---
why cant they make good trailers at arena net ? even every little fan trailer on yt does his job better. and then the music choice ......
---
Actually it's pretty much exactly what Anet says. Releasing strike missions and make them harder with the time to help people getting into raids step by step.
---
Born and raised in New Mexico. We are few, but we feel the joke in our bones. It's a reference you can smell, like New Mexico smells in August.
---
Some items no longer drop in the game (like those rare weapons). People buy all the supply of a no longer dropping item and list a single one for 10k gold because it inflates their account value on gwefficiency.com. 
---
When the only TP price for an item is for 10k gold and you have 50 others in inventory it adds 500k to your account value. 
---
They are not worth that much and no one buys them unless by mistake or just to throw money away.
---
&gt; do these people think that when they go into work they are being  scammed? (i mean they are but that's not a common political opinion) 
---
The difference here is that GW2 is a game, and GW2 characters don't need nourishment and a safe place to sleep every night.
---
I watched the announcement. It was nothing definitive or concrete.
---
Not to burst your bubble but I guess this is just a callback to the spider mount they initially intended but scrapped bc it was triggering arachnophobic people.
---
They showed concepts and stuff in one of their live streams: [http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gw2-early-mount-concepts-4.jpg](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gw2-early-mount-concepts-4.jpg)
---
And only half of the dialogue is Brahms voice actor putting on a deeper tone!
---
People wasting their life trying to grow their "wealth" instead of living it. Nothing wrong with wanting money, money provides you with comfort and security. But there are people who just want money for moneys sake. 
---
Same shit, but it matters less in game.
---
Assuming you have the gold yourself, is there any reason why you were ever do this over making and selling the Legendary yourself?
---
I like how people think it's all about the gold, and the gold is the only thing this barons make off of u, when in reality they make real life money off of ur hard work. Who do you think supplies all those illegal by games rules sites. They brag that their banks are filled with legendary weapons, but do u really think it's that profitable just to keep them, maybe u could use one or two to play with the market, but have u considered that those weapons never actually enters the TP in the first place. You all think that to these barons it's all about to get a bigger wealth in game, but what's the point when u're already on top and have everything u could have in game, so u can't even spend any of that gold. I think they have surpassed the game, and are actually make a real life profit from fools who think they can make some easy gold in game.
---
Even story dungeon difficulty would have been nice.
---
Some of the best things in this patch are things that are *not* in the patch.
---
I don't think Taimi has a single line of dialogue.
---
Holy hell it's so refreshing going through a patch with Asura meddling in everything. Gorrik's here, and there's a couple Asura scattered throughout the zone, but for once they're more of a footnote and it's probably why the world feels so much more interesting.
---
making gold without gems is so easy idk why people gotta hustle.
---
Charr master race !
---
It's more that they just don't understand how much money they could be making and how simple it would be to take those extra steps.
---
And cartels don't technically scam people out of their money all the time??? lol
---
Yeah okay shill, you sure do feel optimistic.
---
Even if the RMT myth is strong, the truth is that all these super expensive trash items are no longer available ingame. That's why there are so few items offered. It also proofs that the RMT myth is just a myth, because it's very unlikely that a RMT buyer has one of these items.
---
Guys you have to understand that tp are not the only people that you have to do this with. You can do it with your own friends, and doing so can dodge the tp taxes. 
---
Besides, if you feel like you arent gonna use the 12k spirit shards youre sitting on, you can sell them. 
---
I dont think they “dodged the questions” theres just a lot of technicality going on. Generally, i dont think WP’s questions were specific enough. We know the generality of the questions he asked and what they meant but it wasn’t enough. 
---
They want people to do this with eachother. Not just them
---
&gt; it's not any more of a scam than basic capitalism.
---
its an instance, so maybe they give the choice to chose which difficulty to play at the entrance. normal, evolved, etc.
---
would be the easiest solution, dont you think?
---
Or just cull any players not in a squad or party from your vision in that room while you have that story step active.
---
We know they have that technology.
---
Why not limit the gemstore notes as well to: new gemstore update, go check it out?
---
&gt; Yes, we tp barons are scammers and we manipulate entire economy, so we make crazy amounts and steal your gold, making all item prices insaneny high in the process. 
---
That's about the sum of it, yeah.
---
&gt;If its so easy, you does 99.99% of game population doesnt do it?
---
Nobody claimed that it was easy, just that it was a skillset that should not make players considerably more wealthy than adventurers in an action/adventure RPG game. If this was designed and promoted as a "Wolf of Wall Street" game then I don't think anyone would have any problem with it.
---
Find a group you can reliably do fractals with, or try to pug with at least one or two people you can know and trust, even just one person you know is good can make a big difference when otherwise pugging fractals.
---
Thanks, I just made it in time and it was a blast.
---
That will teleport you into the past to meet the ancestors of charr.
---
Hi back to running around in circles pressing F :^ ]
---
Well, it is still in line with what real charr would do. It is the "veteran" problem. War ended, what now? They don't know how to live peacefully. So they create new war.
---
Bangar is old, he would be gone soon anyways.
---
It's because they were playing an action/adventure game rather than a market simulator, and were punished for doing so.
---
So who at Anet is responsible for that incredible idea?
---
There isn't anything disingenuous about my statement and I think you've made a less convincing argument by implying so.
---
Patch notes are not marketing. Nothing is being hidden as these features have been announced and discussed. That would be the whole renting out a theatre (a mistake imo), numerous interviews, social media post and the mock up magazine (which was great) - the features of this patch have been well advertised.
---
This is simply very typical of how Anet does things. If you actually look at the patch notes that you linked, neither of them provide additional information on what you'll find in the map, how the story will develop, the meta events present, the collections present and other niceties such as upgradeable armor.
---
However, many of them were advertised elsewhere - just look at the armor in War Eternal. This was not mentioned in the patch notes but it absolutely was highlighted in trailers and on social media.
---
When I read patch notes for WoW, I see a lot of scene setting about the areas being introduced or the raids that are being added. We get the same thing, just communicated in a different way. Instead of it written in patch notes things are released through over channels.
---
Anet have operated like this for as long as I can remember. Which means to meme about this, and argue otherwise, is disingenuous as patch note lengths are being correlated with amount and quality of content (which has never been the case - look at Long Live the Lich for example). Alternatively, it shows a complete lack of critical thinking as people haven't gone and compared *story* patch notes between releases. If they had, they'd have seen that there isn't much difference from usual.
---
may i ask how you can get 2 gifts of battle in 6 hours? according to Wiki:  "The overall minimal time to complete a reward track is 4h 20m"
---
I don't know if anything modern would fit the theme of the game.
---
Concert event grants Iron legion key, you can get this one once per day to open the Khan-Ur vault (you need key for all 4 legions, thus also from 3 other main events) for achiev and chance to loot new exotic weapons or infusion.
---
I actually think its more than Caudecus. Caudecus wanted to rule Kryta. Bangar wants to rip up the treaty essentially declaring war on humans and maybe the rest of the races who stand against him. How he is going to do this. Get a dragon on his side. They said this will be a darker story some predictions I have, Bubble, Steve, Underwater tentacle monster attacks from the Unending ocean maybe not destroying places but killing a buttload of people while we in the North deal with Bangar who will likely become the right hand charr for Jormag as he attacks more and more of Tyria and I think that Queen Jennahs life is very much at stake.
---
That's not accounting for reward track boosts gained from each of the tier chests (Wood, Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc). You might not know, but when your tier up the reward chest, you get a decent Reward Track boost.
---
&gt;;3c
---
Doesnt change the fact that they are buying the shards and gift of mastery off people their reasons do seem sketchy and i wouldnt trust the benevolence of a rich person.
---
My pleasure o7
---
We are talking about the mystic recipe which costs 10 gold. So in that context 40g matters. And OP left out this piece in his calculation.
---
And secondly, the amount is small doesn't make it any more fairer aspect of the trade. I can say, since established traders are benevolent and rich, why don't they foot the bill.. Only 40g in 50k gold personal bank?
---
Hardstyle is electro.
---
&gt; Personally, if I die or the group wipes, I'll always self-critique my own play first before I even think about saying something to anyone else.
---
Same thing here. When you wipe, assume you caused it. You are always the common factor in the groups you wipe with, so might as well go with that simple common factor. (For this reason I generally also pug for way lower KP than I actually have (400~, but I pug at 200kp max), because I know I mistakes and I'm anxious about getting kicked for making them.)
---
There's bad experiences, but they're also not as common as we'd like to think... if people get irritated they'll usually just leave instead of forcing a kick.
---
They could just make it open world &gt; HoT/PoF &gt; LWS 1/2/3/4/5/6...  
---
Keep world bosses and squad as it is now.
---
I honestly think 42s is a fair price. A lot of the top tier conversions of gw2eff are very expensive weapons that only a few people are going to buy each month. Even t5-&gt;t6 conversions will only award you 60s or so if you list everything on the TP and make buy orders.
---
So you're telling me, that if I work **for** someone, I won't be earning as much as them.... Thanks.
---
Of course you're not going to make the same money as them by doing their dirty work. Does a janitor earn as much as the CEO? No, they don't. Same here.
---
I predict it will be in the map we go to in episode 1 and 2. I don't think its hall of monuments related unless we go there in the story. We are going to the Far Shiverpeaks anyone who thought we'd skip over the Eye Of the North clearly weren't thinking.
---
The amount of gold you make by selling gift of exploration is the same amount you will make farming any map in less than 6 hours, imagine working 8 hours a day in a shop for 10 times less in comparison to the guy washing the windows a few times a day, it's a scam and underpaying people for their work is just sleazy.
---
It was pretty awesome!
---
The songs too! 
---
Yesterday evening I said to myself that I had to see what this concert was all about, this after the ooze event.
---
The concert did not disappoint. I was hyped &lt;3
---
I really wish the casual crowd would stop thinking everything is for them.. Oh wait, thats actually the case
---
Increasing gold drops lead to inflation of currency lmao, would literally change nothing. You now have 1000g instead of 100g except that what you want to buy costs 30g rather than 3g. Supply and demand of materials changes prices in a meaningful way for consumers.
---
Thank you to this individual who actually took the time to recalculate all this and shed enlightenment.
---
I did not properly verify that, but it seems to line up with the 2 hour day and night cycle and starting at midnight/evenly number hours of real time. Splitting 2 real hours into 24 Tyrian hours gives you 5 real minutes per Tyrian hour.
---
So:
---
* Tyrian AM -&gt; even hour
---
* Tyrian PM -&gt; odd hour
---
* Tyrian hours times 5 -&gt; minutes
---
Yeah cuz you've never seen a mount in silverwastes /s
---
Glad to see more linux users! I have a feeling there's a good number of us.
---
im worried that this map will not last a week.
---
&gt;something we haven't heard of him doing any research on before.
---
what? hes a bug geek, he gushed about the -now dead- spiders at suns refuges
---
Sweet. thanks :D
---
You gotta cheer when Bangar says he wants to hear the crowd in his speech.
---
I'm pretty sure when they talked about big money they talked about the making deals part, and the spirit shard conversion is about the resources people already have, they say the big money is in deals, and specifically not in tp deals because there is only so much traffic and a tax
---
I only watched the first hour tho, but i doubt someone would unironically recommend farming for world completion as a viable gold making method
---
Given that it doesn't share the usual text appearance for a skin, it's probably just a prop weapon, probably for one of the hearts on the new map. I wouldn't get your hopes up, sorry.
---
...is ludicrous, I know.
---
God, that luminescent grind.
---
Your right in GW1 that was 250 years before GW2. 250 years there were plenty of countries in the real world that weren't discovered did it stay that way up until now no. Things can change over 250 years it doesn't stay static. I'm sorry if it seems I'm dismissing your post but I'm not shocked that some Ascalonians likely from the Eye of the North or Longeyes Ledge went out and discover some new places.
---
In my honest opinion. People are trying to skew it to sound like a scam or just don't like the idea just because they aren't make 100% of the profit. They're already basically making 1,300g for map completion. Someone making 125g on top of that is basically nothing. If they want that 125g for themselves on top of 1,300g. Thats a bit greedy. It's like asking a company to sell their products for 0% profit just so the customer gets more out of it.
---
However I don't think this post was a direct hate/smear campaign. Just a bit of misinformation.
---
Are thieves supposed to be at 20k health?
---
Maybe you should go for singleplayer game then. This is made on purpose so you have to trade with others. It is made on purpose that you get value from the playing even many hours in. In your mind, you would give out the unique rewards and then what? Tell people to log off?
---
In this case they *might* be providing the full "market" value because they dodge the 15% TP fees. IRL this would be called tax evasion and you can go to jail for that, but as far as I'm aware P2P trading is not actually banned in GW2.
---
Why would people learn something if there's zero incentive? If there's no punishment, they'll just keep facetanking everything because it works and it requires zero effort.
---
Hey..
---
Is there any viable Guardian Sword+Shield (or Sword+Focus) build? Looking for something versatile that can do fractals, open world.. just something I'd love to play with :)
---
My current Firebrand Axe+Torch has good DPS but personally I don't like it.. idk why..
---
Thanks
---
I agree I think Bangar knows exactly what he’s doing. He’s taken the fringe element of the Charr society march then to Jormag so like you said to create a new war a new or enemy.
---
Oh, Isee. Because it happened to me that I run around, and suddenly being attached by 10 monsters :-)
---
Guess it was just a crowded place.
---
cuz the game is fucking perfect a?
---
Well maybe you should think about your build for a bit.
---
it wouldnt be easier with less
---
If they want to show casuals how a raid works, how it looks like, for that reason it is ok. The only problem that they dont have to show this. It doesnt need to be shown. Because everyone knows it. Every casual knows how a raid looks like. Its a 10 man instance where you aim to kill a "mini world boss" that has lot of hp and hard mechanic.  I guess they just wanted to show this, because if they wanted to players actually feel like that they are in a raid, an easy, entry level raid, it failed very badly. Its way too easy, you dont even have to dodge, you dont even have to do anything else to kill it other than press 1. It doesnt teach you anything. Most world bosses has harder mechanics that you actually need to pay attention.
---
From any aspects this strike mission is just useless. It doesnt do anything.
---
I don't think I get the power of the bow, exactly. It was used to break Serpent's Tooth, so now norns think it's time to get even on Jormag, but does it has any special powers apart from the ability to actually scratch him?
---
Yet you wont stop shitting on people that arent mindlessly smashing their head into their keyboard while drooling all over it.
---
If hardcore players were nicer / teaching more/ more welcoming / reeeeee raids too elitist!! Its their own fault QQ.
---
When push comes to shove we see time and time again most of these players have zero interest in content that is remotely possible to fail. Instead we remove any content that can punish bad gameplay.
---
By forcing ALL content to be exceptionally easy you merely alienate a significant fraction of anets fans / gw2 players, leading to less income and longevity. Almost like wild star...
---
That's the thing with this strike mission. It doesn't matter if your screw things up or not.
---
And then they made content that's essentially impossible to fail.
---
I actually wonder why they don't use voice distortion in a greater degree. Voices are already altered but there is so much more that could be done
---
Well the enemy is still same - non charrs. &gt;!But there is a need to level the weaponry by getting own dragon.!&lt;
---
Rewards Tier Chests bring the time bellow 4 hours. WvW rank is also a factor for Pip acquisition increasing reward rates. Hence the ~ (Approximate) 3 hours. Any discrepancies upwards of 1 hours will only account for a 1/40 (2.5%) Gold/hr loss. Basically negligible. 
---
If ignoring Reward Tier Chests and using 4:20hr for casual farmers, that still fits well within my 37 to 40 hour leeway as stated in the beginning. &gt; "Making it closer to ~1,309g for 37 hours of work. Lets round it to 40 hours since not everyone is 100% efficient."
---
It might. Since you would be able to kill the enemies faster.
---
You are thief. What about investing a bit into stealth?
---
Yes, I agree. But as I said in my entry post. We were a duo and one of is was on a DH trap build. Since the boss doesn't trigger traps, he only had his weapon skills. And if you can kill an training encounter with builds that are not even working within it's design, it's not a really good training experience. It's actually more damaging because what it tells people is "It doesn't matter if you are useless, as long as there is someone else who can at least do something."
---
You can kill them faster with less health, thiefs aren't that bad to play as glass cannons with their evades and burst damage. What stats is your exotics, soldier (Power, Vitality, Toughness) stats?
---
I thought it was amusing that the first time I'd ever had a use for the item in a new JP I wasn't allowed to.. Clever plan from ANet, but also sad that I've found little use for it since it released.
---
&gt;In this case they might be providing the full "market" value because they dodge the 15% TP fees.
---
IF this is the case, then it could be fair. IF these traders are providing you with 100% of the market value of the sword, and the cut they get is the 15% TP fees they avoid, then that would be a fair value transaction. 
---
I just *highly* doubt that this is the case. 
---
But really in that case, maybe ANet should be providing a better deal to players on high value transactions, like taking a less than 15% cut when it comes to very high value transactions or something. This "exploit" should not be exclusively available to the well-connected.
---
Then it's the same for all legions. My charr is ash legion and had the same letter.
---
Exactly, the real threat is Jormag. Bangar just kind of feels like a forced plot device to bring racial divide into the story yet again.
---
Anet was always up front with the fact that the game economy and trading post are a central part of the game. If players dont want to bother to engage in it, thats fine. But then they have no grounds to complain that others that do will reap the rewards.
---
Take my damn upvote haha
---
In my batch of randoms two didn't make it through the jump puzzle and one got stuck in textures and died. So difficulty is definitely there.
---
I saw someone from anet in another post telling us to stay tuned
---
English is not my main language, what is so fun about this "Nice axe" comment?
---
100% accurate, but that's what the casuals want. Itll effectively make raids the new dungeons with more (rarely replayed unless stupidly rewarding) content for them to 1111.
---
Whenever I log into the game my frames lag horribly and i get like a frame every 5 seconds or so. Tried on multiple maps. Last night was fine after the patch dropped, had no problem whatsoever.
---
there is no smarter pull, they have aggro radius within the whole camp

Season 2: "Snaring Briar" (Scarlet history recap + vines strangling people)
---
Season 3: "From the Ashes" (we don't *literally* burn down the jungle but close enough, most foes are resurgent or literally resurrected, also *fire*)
---
Season 4: "Crystal Legacy" (duh)
---
Yeah, but that has no source other than "there are ruins there", which is what you're asking about. It's speculation, in other words.
---
Why do we need another easier option, as raid entry? The devs themselves said that Fractals are considered to be the raid entry level? There is no real difference between 5 man and 10 man content except for the fact that there are more people around. And that your skills that technically effect 10 friends, work now for their full potential.
---
So... basically... Is this now an excuse for Arena Net to drop Fractals as entry point, because we are now having Strikes? If that's the plan, then prepare for the fact that we will never see the release of any new fractal or CM again.
---
You can have entry points to raiding, that is not holding your hand like this strike mission... This one is basically a mini raid. Only one boss in an instance. Not 3 with in between events and trashmobs. Only one encounter you can try over and over again without much buildup work. They could have make it a bit easier than normal raid bosses but still challenging. This would have been a better training experience just because people don't sign up for 3 different encounters when joining a raiding team.
---
Well, better than waiting 4-6 hours for the patch to be applied and then being stuck in a queue to even login to the game.
---
Didn't they state multiple time in the video that yes they are making profit out of you doing that ? I quite clearly recall then saying it multiple time. Then 2 hours of video is quite long, I understand that you can't remember everything. 
---
And if people just giving services and doing nothing making money annoys you, I can't wait till you start a revolution in your country. Because you know, that's capitalism for you.
---
Maybe then just relax. You don't need to have goals 24/7. go around the maps. Help newbies. Join random lfgs without consideration how much you loot from it. Or even just sit somewhere and talk with others. 
---
There is always some value, it does not need to be ingame currency though...
---
Humans never reached that far north. I mean, the Flame Legion found the titans at Hrangmer in 800 AE - Hrangmer is where the Citadel of Flame was built, in NE Fireheart Rise. And the charr began pushing back after that.
---
It's much more simple than earning all the accountbound portions of the weapon crafting, especially once you've done it a few times. I'm not saying that this sort of transaction would not be worth *any* profitability, but it wouldn't be worth a *significant* portion of the profits. 
---
It might be faster than a person listing it themselves, but if you spend the time to collect the other items, then what's a little time on the TP? And they might be able to list it for a better price than the average player could, but is the difference between that price and the price the average player would get large enough to eat up the entire cut the trader gets?
---
I'm Kodan and I feel offended.
---
I did the PoF-Story as a Berserker Thief, solo. Granted, I am mostly a WvW-Roamer, which is maybe the best training you can have on a class, but still, here are some tips how to steamroll PoF.
---
\- Put on Berserker/Marauder gear and slot Invigorating Precision. You should never have to use your heal skill, ever.
---
\- Have a stunbrak slotted as Oh-Fuck-Button. Always.
---
\- Have Assassin's Signet slotted. Always. 
---
\- Play Daredevil/Staff and dodge through almost everything while doing ridiculous amounts of damage and healing yourself via Invigorating Precision
---
Exactly. Mechanics that are not enforced are skipped. Training people to ignore those mechanics won't help then get better.
---
&gt; That won't work, if you already have the trade network you can move around bulk goods almost as easily. Legendaries probably compound the highest number of intermediate steps in which they can dodge additional fees but no fees will always be more profitable than any high value transaction deal.
---
Sure, but if ANet could *reduce* the gap, it would still be of benefit to those players who don't have access to the exploit.
---
Nah.
---
And yet apparently thousands of players have been able to do it over the years. 
---
I have to be fair not done if since shortly after PoF was released, but I have no memory of pulling the whole camp when doing it on my mesmer.
---
I think the idea is/was to gradually add more difficulty to these Strike Missions.  
---
Like, in this instance you got familiar with basic mechanics that also occur in raids, without instantly getting dropped on your forehead if you missed it.
---
If they slowly but steadily amp up the pace and unforgiving nature of Bosses, I could definitely see this work to get randoms together, building friendships and working up towards trying raids together with people they've come to enjoy playing with.
---
That said, I was similarly negatively surprised at how easy it was.  
---
Genuinely the hardest part about the Strike Mission now, was the Jumping Puzzle at the start because the terrain wouldn't render for me lol.
---
But yeah, I do see the potential in the design here.
---
The mini raid from wintersday was more interesting than this strike mission.
---
Think of it as being just an open world event but with just 10 people (or less).  Like most group events, they can be soloed.  
---
This is just an instanced open world group event.
---
And this is why I like it because you're not going to see people getting toxic with each over builds and whatever else like most things.
---
Rememer that little mini-Christmas raid thing they had?  I did it the first day (before everyone learned it well enough to start complaining) playing a build I knew could carry most.  And I didn't go back especially after hearing friends who hated it days later and confirming they never wanted to do raids because of their experience with the other players.
---
Because this strike mission is so basic, it's hard for people to get toxic (though of course you still will have it with people complaining because it took 3 minutes to beat).  While it remains mostly toxic free like fractals on lower levels, I'll do it more unlike most group content done with PUGs.
---
Do I want it hard?  Much more, but only if it really, truly scales.  I would prefer the actual content to be much harder than raids but for it to truly scale from solo to 2 people to 5 people to 10 people and everywhere in between.  And it should be an option.  Give us the public and squad option still (love that), but also give the option of choosing difficulty scale from 1 to 10.  Once you choose, you get grouped up with others who chose the same number.
---
And keep rewards about the same, maybe just a touch more on level 10 versus level 1.  This just allows flexibility and choice is good.  Want boss fight harder than current raid? Choose squad, pick difficulty 10, bring desired number of people and go at it.
---
Just want some simple, mindless fun, choose public, level 1.  Those are two end extremes.  You can have everything in between.  Despite what many people think, choice is good and this allows people to have the difficulty they want and the number of people they want (including solo option).
---
leveled
---
I don’t play this game.
---
im not talking about the instance that comes after it
---
This one has also nice mechanics and a phase change at 50% health. Thing is, that the second phase takes away mechanics from the first phase and adds one new thing that is supposed to wipe you. But it actually doesn't wipe the group because everything else that follows up does not enough damage to really kill you. You can quiet comfortable use downed skill 4 to get up or rezz multiple people while also ignoring all the mechanics that are going on.
---
Keep in mind they have assumed this and aggressively demanded all content be catered to them. "Hard" maps like orr and hot had to be nerfed, specs had to be designed with casuals in mind, wvw, pvp and raids made more appealing for the casual audience. Anything that doesnt revolve around them is a waste of resources, toxic and hated on.
---
Yet none of the attempts to get casuals into the other content actually worked long term. It gets openworld players to try it out for a week, then nope out again, while alienating any other players. Frankly most of the attempts to make harder content more accessible for casuals failed miserably.
---
PoF is more difficult than regular content, that includes the Story as well. There isn't just a faceroll situation anymore and you have to learn how to identify the attacks, dodge them or use whatever skills/buffs/items/whatever you have at your disposal to not get hit by them.
---
Thieves are great in evading and dealing a lot of damage and also having blind fields to not get hit in the first place. Different Professions are not as forgiving running the same build in every situation. If you get killed by some situation then change up your positioning, lure enemies into a single position and burst them down. You have the possibility to change your build whenever you are out of combat so use this.
---
Having a large health pool doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to avoid that damage in the first place and it also means it will take damage out of your build and you will take longer to kill enemies and that also means they have more time to hit you.
---
Play with the AI of the enemies. Break Line of sight to let them run to you, plant traps and bomb them.
---
Is this pre searings area?
---
We don't want or need "introduction to raids." We want easy mode versions of the existing raids.
---
Yup! [This one should have the 8 symbols.](https://imgur.com/a/B3FNwM2) Thanks!
---
How did they finish the story required to unlock the strike mission without already knowing that? Does relogging or getting kicked from the group not work in the strike mission?
---
Wow! This also best explains the stairs *inside* Khan ur gauntlet which is supposed to be treasury of a sort
---
billy is a lumberman and he has a bunch of wood, while melinda owns a furniture shop
---
johnny the entrepreneur comes in, buys the wood for cheap and finds a carpenter to craft some furniture..then the same johnny sells the final product to melinda
---
the raw materials aren't his, the labor isn't his and neither is his shop..yet he makes a nice profit!
---
is this one of the pitfalls of capitalism? no, it's called having a fucking business
---
That’s exactly where. One of them says something along the lines of you can tell a lot about someone by the weapons they carry, to which his colleague says “Nice axe”.
---
I mean it's an okay release, we can't wait anything more. I like the story, I like the ambience, like the feeling of the map. But seriously, nobody noticed how shitty the textures are compared to LS4 or PoF ones? It's screaming GW2 Vanilla. While the map is cool, Dragonfall for example is classes above this in terms of visuals.
---
Again this is already accounted for even at max rank + commander + outnumbered + 1 st place + wood previous week etc you can't get enough pips to get enough reward track points to get down to 3 hours. It is straight up impossible.
---
Thanks I was gonna do this myself because OP is completely biased and obviously click baiting people with the "scam" thingy. I'm not on anyone's side, I've never done this and I just love theorycrafting, but OP isn't objective at all, thanks for providing the other face.
---
Because the game revolves around providing safespace for players who struggle. Doesnt matter if they struggle with mechanics, buttons, basic reasoning, common sense or being social in any way. In gw2 saying "hello" to someone can be challenging.
---
As the game caters to the lowest denominator, the playerbase shifts in that direction as well. Anyone who finds the concept of actually selecting traits trivial is likely to get bored of gw2. Players who play for 5 years but still have lvl 25 greens equipped enjoy actually succeeding for once. Natural selection at its finest.
---
I agree with the scaling part. If there would be a content "level" attached to it that you can basically go in training mode for basics, normal mode for the basics with actual damage and master mode for the real "training raid" experience, that would be totally fine. But we don't have it. Only thing we have is an really easy encounter that is supposed to become a training raid later down the line.
---
Having 10 man content without the "toxic" behavior of the community will never really exist. Just wait one or two days and people will become toxic in this strike as well about minor things. And again, it was planned as raid entry level content. Being able to do it solo, duo or with a 5 man group defeats a bit the point of it, don't you think?
---
Arena Net actively advertised strike missions as training raids. Content for people who are afraid of joining raids, to get better for the real thing. But it's not. It's nowhere near to being a training experience for raids. It's, as you said, a normal open world event thrown into a instance.
---
The character models are really showing there ago. Plus she looks awful. Her original model is much better
---
I see a lot of comments about "casuals" and the need to keep the encounter simple. I really disagree with this idea. My experience meeting and talking to a lot of people over the years in GW2 is that a lot of "casuals" are not bad at games and therefore casuals. Instead a lot of them are long time MMO players, parents with kids sometimes, people with demanding jobs, who just don't have the time to dedicate to raiding anymore.  
---
People not joining raids is more about time, than it is about ability.  The encounter did not have to be this simple.  It's insultingly simple.
---
I also found this encounter very disappointing.  I like the idea, and the structure, but it was literally a tank and spank fight. All mechanics could be ignored.  At the very least, they could have given us a boss like Warden Amala in Istan.
---
arc hasnt been updated, remove it and it should be good.
---
That's just stupid. Why? If I have all the mats, crafting would take me literal seconds.
---
Not for you or the majority of the player base. I'm just explaining why the sub has been so pessimistic recently and why OP has no reason not to be optimistic. YOU are the player ANet is catering to.
---
Not even. With 6 people, it was absolutely trivial. Stood still mostly, tank and spank.
---
Did once. Was fun. Can't imagine doing in repeatedly and having fun.
---
This is a MMO. I've played plenty in my life, and all of them require you to deal with the market at some point. It's a fundamental part of the system.
---
Go in with Daggerstorm to damage as much mobs as possible from the get go or use daggerstorm as an ‚oh shit i need to reposition myself to not die and in the meanwhile damage as much as I can around me‘ - if you have aggro of all of them anyway. Might help :)
---
Oh right. It will Daze anyway and will Stun only if hit from the back. Confusing, on most games Daze/Stun is the same thing :-)
---
Because i enjoy it. Simply as that. I dont enjoy pvp, i dont enjoy pve, i dont enjoy raiding, i dont enjoy LS, i dont enjoy grinding and farming, I enjoy trading and speculating. And yes - i trade on real markets as well, and i trade in gw2 when i want to relax.
---
Ha, cool! I never even heard about about-face. Will check how it works.
---
Tried without ARC as well, problems persisted. Forgot to mention in the post, I tried all the combos with the 2 addons.
---
Thank you for this comment. Everything I wanted to day but I'm on phone and getting ready for work. Up you go!
---
Oh, side works? will have to try it, cool!
---
The most upsetting thing is, that the "jumping puzzle" you need to complete in order to get to this boss, is harder than the boss itself. And it requires more movement than the boss...
---
Yes.
---
Dealing with the market, fine. Having the market be magnitudes *more* profitable than playing any other aspect of the game, not fine. If they want a market in which a player who spends ten hours actively and effectively working at the markets can make as much profit as someone spending ten hours farming mobs, then fine, that's fair. But if a player can spend only a few minutes working on the market, here or there, and make *more* money than a player spending ten hours farming mobs, then the game's economy is unbalanced in favor of the markets.
---
Not to.mention they lack some aspects of raiding too. Breakbars for example.
---
Orr Rytlock starting to call us boss during HoT.
---
&gt; what armor should I buy and where? On TP there is crafted Assassins coat (I can craft it myself) or Zhed's. Is there any better Exotic option to obtain? For karma or any other tokens so I know what to grind to get it?
---
Wherever you can get it cheapest, although be aware that karma merchant armour can't be salvaged so getting runes back out of it can be expensive. 
---
Metabattle has a lot of build guides and usually provides a cheap option for gear as well as the top-tier stuff and is usually worth a look at. Crafting usually works out cheaper than buying, but not by an enormous amount. 
---
&gt;  is it reasonable to grind for crafting Legendary or should I skip it untill much later?
---
A legendary is basically a personal achievement thing, although it dies offer convenience in stat swapping. Gen 1 legendaries are much cheaper than Gen 2 and a part of it is unlocked by achievements, which I think works as a really good content guide for new level 80s. Legendaries *are* expensive, but don't let the price put you off as it's entirely achievable if you chip away at it. A huge amount of the cost is circumvented by the LS4 map currencies allowing you to get cheap trophies, so don't take the cost as gospel. Tldr: up to you. Focus on ascended first, though.
---
&gt; Third question Bloodstone dust? Delete/craft/else? So far I craft it into bricks but I am low on shards.
---
It's used in some legendaries, so check. You end up with so much of it, though, that condensing it down into bricks won't do you any harm. There are also item converters (Princess, Herta etc) that help break down bag crap into more useful bag crap. 
---
&gt; Fourth question: what after exotic gear? Is it worth to upgrade? Or should I aim at it right now?
---
You will need ascended gear to progress in fractals, which are scaling dungeons that get harder as you go up. Start off with exotics and replace it bit by bit as you go. You don't need full exotics until you get pretty far into fractals, so focus on exotic right not. 
---
Ascended gear is about 5% more powerful but more importantly allows you to slot for agony resistance, which is allows you to progress in fractals without instantly dying.
---
Look for named armor pieces with berserker stats, they can be cheaper!
---
Ah I see you found my book.
---
In a video where they stressed making something out of all of the currencies and materials you have available to you, how was your takeaway that you should continue insta selling everything after only one crafting step?
---
Not a baron.  
---
  
---
&gt;and they don’t even have to play the game…  
---
wrong. this is them playing the game. it's not an incorrect way of playing just because it's not the way YOU play it.  
---
this is not a scam. the video may be slightly obfuscating, but in no way at all a scam.
---
getting skins and achievements is what he spoke of, and thats content. period.
---
Those two words are going to stick with me for the rest of this plot, I just know it.
---
Those two better hook up.
---
I don't speak for MM or Xushin but as a close friend to MM and a member of his guilds, I'd like to clear some things up.
---
We aren't trying to scam anyone and I think that's a very strong word to just throw around. 
---
 What is offered is simply an option for people.  We aren't telling people to go do this so we can profit off them.  After talking to several players, there were a lot with excess materials they simply didn't know what to do with.  Spirit shards, T5 mats, and gifts of exploration.  Paying someone ~500g for the exploration was just a way for them to make some gold instead of it sitting in their bank or inventory.  One guy in a PvE guild I ran had 19 of them.  He just liked doing map completion when he was bored so I told MM about him.  As for mat promotions, there is a profit to be made for both sides.  The converter makes gold by having a set price given to them so RNG doesn't screw them over.  The person paying them then ends up making gold by taking the T6 materials and creating gifts without the need to really play the game and obtain spirit shards.
---
I realize how this all looks.  The rich get richer by really not doing much.  However this is not a scam.  Its not required by anyone, its simply an option.  Its always 100% up to the player/seller if they think they are making a good deal.  If both sides are happy with the outcome then there is no problem.
---
I'll be glad to answer any questions!
---
Ok show your math. How are you making up 6,240 reward track points (The difference between 4hrs and 20 mins and 3 hrs)? Thats 250 instant reward track progress'. Which is over 35 diamond chests because they give 7 each @25 instant reward track point progress. Each diamond chest is 55 pips. So you need 1,925 pips in 36 tick or 3 hours.  This means you need to average 53 pips a tick to get close to 3 hours. The math really doesn't work to get even close to 3 hours. 4 hours? sure.
---
welcome to gw2. It's actually a game for people who are too dumb to play games.
---
What confused me the most, is that it doesnt even have a breakbar
---
have you ever used the TP? it's a player-driven economy.  
---
what these guys do is literally, yes, literally, what the TP market should support.  
---
yes, they can spawn loot and gold out of thin air. this creates inflation. it's an economy.  
---
in real life, money (most often) doesn't just disappear in the way it does in GW2.  
---
in real life, money circulates.  
---
in gw2, money gets magically added and magically removed. (vendors, gold sinks etc)  
---
it has a very stable and capitalistic economy.  
---
it works.
---
It seemed incredibly scummy just listening to it.
---
Surprised WP gave them basically what amounted to free promotion for their scheme.
---
The jp is easy as well, you can skip half of it
---
Thank you for long answer! For now I bought full Zhed's set and I'm planning to fill it wiht rune of Strength. Should be enough for completing story. 
---
This game had a lot of content when I started playing (7 years ago) and now it has it few times more. Amount of currencies itslef made me dizzy.. Everywhere are some merchants that use different type of currency, different requirement etc. I am slowly getting grasp of it but still I have some mind blow when I obtain some item which after checking wiki it turns out to be component in crafting something but to craft it I need to craft something else and so on (like I've got Mysterious Seed).
---
For now I'll focus on story mode and crafting/forging some items to sell on market to earn some gold. I plan to buy character slot and create 49lvl character so I can open bags on it to maximize profits.
---
&gt; Simple: capitalistic economies are efficient at distributing limited resources.
---
Except they don't. Global food production is already high enough in numbers to feed the entire world's population, but economic inequalty makes it harder to distribute and leads to massive food waste.
---
This problem is remarkably high in Third-world countries most of them in their current state due to capitalist economies: Be it colonialism in the 19th/20th centuries and it's consecuences or the exploitation of resources by multinational corporations.
---
If the collected player data was the reason why this strike mission was developed as it is now, then I am inclined to agree. I just hope that this has nothing to do with any analytical task someone did on the communities gameplay data. Because if so, I am really concerned now that some people just randomly drop dead because they were not reminded to breath.
---
Wouldn't say it's bad tbh, I just don't care about dragon in general.. didn't care day 1 and it's not getting any more interesting after 7 years of tackling the exact same semi-mindless threat.
---
And this should tell you everything you need to know about the encounter.
---
Current build of Arc has issues that really break when chainloading. Wait for an update. Otherwise, if d912pxy standalone is still causing issues, try a clean install of the latest version, and if that fails, share log.txt and crash.txt.
---
The thing about legendaries required a crapton of T6 and gold is because you get T6 mats and gold from virtually everything whereas you only get dungeon tokens from some of the worst PvE content in the game.
---
The only reason I've made the legendaries that I have is because I was about to make them by playing however I wanted, converting all the generic rewards into gold and then buying the specific mats I need. Your way I would have been forced to grind Sorrow's Embrace a hundred more times which was what made me quit the game back on launch.
---
naah, it's more like retextured assets from kralk
---
The fact that ppl view achievements as content makes me sad
---
That's with the implication that I'm running map explorations rather than farming maps. 
---
It's not exactly taxing to get each one of my characters to 100% map eventually, and I've got no more Gen 1 legendaries that I care about making so every Gift of Exploration from that will be sitting in my bank unused. 
---
May as well turn them into money at no cost to myself.
---
I've just made myself a coffee. Nice, free, office coffee. Let's have a look how I was able to do it.
---
First, there is someone in a warm country owning a bunch of land (capital) who hires worker to take care of coffee plants and harvest them. Their capital and management of people gives them money as well as they pay workers, so workers have money.
---
Then a driver stops by to collect the coffee beans and transport them to Italy, where my coffee was roasted. He's getting by his employer as the company was able to stuck a deal with coffee grower guy to transport the beans for a fee.
---
Now the coffee beans arrived in Italy, got roasted and packaged and another driver is picking them up and delivering them to London, where my company could buy them. Fee for driver, fee for the shop.
---
There are also smart and skilled people who built the coffee machine in a company with facilities for building coffee machines. The machine was also sold and delivered for a fee.
---
There is also a farmer with land and cows and employees taking care of the cows, getting milk, transporting it and selling it for a fee.
---
So there is a lot of fees for a bunch of people in the chain to enable me to make a coffee just before a lunch. Would I be able to make it on my own? Sure. All I need is a lot of time and knowledge about all the mentioned things. From agriculture, through transport of different substances to electronics and mechanics of coffee machines.
---
Is anybody doing that? No. Because is make no sense in the time/value calculation. You'd need to spend weeks or months to learn about all the things and your coffee would probably would be way worse than the one I'm drinking now.
---
Also the coffee isn't really free. Company I work for is getting more value, or better said - has ability to make more value, for my work than the cost of my salary with the cost of coffee on top of it. They are happy to pay for it.
---
So in terms of the post - all of those people are getting scammed, me as well as other people are making money of other people work (time).
---
# tldr
---
They explained how economy in the game work. It's the same as RL economy. Money can be made by either money or time. If you don't have money your only asset is time.
---
Also - selling your time is not a scam. Every person in the cain is making profit of time of other people or partnered companies. If they haven't made any profit what would be the point of doing things?
---
Just telling you how it is.
---
Go for it! Actualli thus is exactly what the vid suggests you to do.
---
I turned it on you because are, indeed, a dishonest person and you have proven to be unworthy of being treated fairly by reasonable people. So yes, I am condescending and whatever else you accused me of, but again, I reserve that for people like you who are beyond redemption. I admit and acknowledge my own behavior, you're the one who hasn't admitted yours. 
---
Do everyone on this subreddit a favor and stop posting for a few months.

There was a similar post a few weeks ago. Some really good proposals in there

I'm So happy there wasnt any hearts, makes the ebb and flow of the maps so much better, doesnt cut into exploring or events, you dont feel like you have to stop just to fill the hearts. This map is amazing imho
---
Why wouldn't you source the Map Completion Speed Runners?
---
Either she has a different desk in other people's clients or I'm just completely blind.

[This is what her desk looks like for me.](https://i.imgur.com/p8BmPJo.png) There isn't even any room for symbols to be carved in...
---
what would make me happy is people stopping being disingenuous, you dont like living world and dont feel the need to login is entirely fine. I am not out to make the whole world fall in love with gw2, everyone is free to enjoy which ever game they enjoy the most. My issue is with people seemlingly out on a quest to tarnish the game in a way possible like acting the reason for not wanting to login is having no idea what to expect because of bad patch-notes.
---
Cool see you in 2 years then

K-Pop concert with Aurene as singer.
---
thanks for answer! 
---
Do you have any tips about merchants? I happened to buy two Ascended trinkets with stats I wanted for laurels and I wonder where could I find other interesting offers e.g for Karma or some map currency so I would know where to grind
---
I would say some similar, the value lesson was not selling to them your spirit shards. But use them, do your own weapons ;)
---
97 seconds is right!
---
&gt; There are still major differences between Fractals and Raids.
---
Are any of those differences present in this strike?
---
He said he's using 26 hours on the equation so aside from possibly being a mark against his general credibility, your point is irrelevant
---
Been away since heart of thorns (never finished but close to end. Come back. Ooh mounts are cool.. oh theres like... hours and hours of story to do.. oh theers minigames... and fractals... and why is my map completion only 52 percen..... ooooooh that's a much bigger map.
---
It really needs a dungeon finder for old content though. I would love to do the old raids and alternate dungeon paths but you can't get a group easily like most MMOs.
---
Hype! Gimme leviathans!!
---
I know that, and i'm fine with them trying to create war, but the narrative at the end of the episode has me believing that he's gonna go 'an hero' with absolutely no hope of redemption.
---
It's funny, I never really got the idea that Bangar was old from looking at him, I mean Smodur looks far more rugged than him lol
---
or a GF ^.0
---
The Living Story 3 maps are very good for ascended stuff, and several LS4 maps are also very generous. 
---
At the end of Heart of Thorns, there is a short story quest which unlocks an ascended weapon for you. Fractals also drop ascended gear from time to time and you'll end up salvaging more rings than you ever use.
---
Asura
---
This is reality in *any* MMO. WoW, Runescape, Gw2 diablo etc. if theres a market there will be magnitudes more profit in the market vs grinding.
---
Beetle race is best race.
---
He also got braham bow, the one thing that can hurt him and potentially other elder dragons. 
---
Either way think like this, he is the elder dragon of persuasion, vlast died and failed because he didn't have a champion, we are aurene champion which is why she is so strong, bangar could become jormag champion to lead him to victory. Not as someone who is a mindless converted but someone who accepted his power, and he have enough charisma to convert a lot more norn and charr to his cause.
---
I see we're still digging deeper. Amusing.
---
I agree with you that it is way too easy. But the thing that currently bothers me is now that everyone screams we need a proper introduction to raids. That this isn't close enough so people who currently feel "afraid" should be fcking terrified of trying raids.
---
While in reality raids are really not that hard, for some cms you need 10 people with full focus as 1 mistake can be a whipe. But regular mode is super forgiving. 
---
There are plenty of builds that with any rotation you do even auto attack you get 20k +. Which honestly is enough for most bosses, in others there will be people who carry you.
---
Eventually you will get good enough at the mechanism that you can try to combine it with benchmark dps rotation.
---
There are so many guilds who would love to train you. Don't let people who scream we need a introduction scare you from trying raids today.
---
[That's the top of said cabinet.](https://i.imgur.com/Ia8p3hm.png) No Symbols here for me either.

Doesn't have to be. Shouldn't be. Developers should make every effort to prevent it.
---
Yep, 2-4 days every three months. I did play GW2 (and before GW1) a tons back then which is why I still have enough gold to do mounts and armor collection and stuff without grinding. But I would get bored if it's all I played nowaday.
---
It's fine there is tons of others games to play. Didn't even began iceborne and have yet to finish Divinity OS2.
---
I went through the portal with it in my inventory, nothing.
---
At Diamond Level, you earn ~3.2 Reward Points per Pip (330 Pips for 1,050 Instant Reward). Accounting for Maximum Pips (Most Efficient Farmer) you get ~460.4 reward track points per tick. Sitting you a tad over 3:30hrs. Which fits the approximation of 3 hours. But as I said. Even if you aren't efficient on time. It accounts for less than a 2g/hr loss.

Sacred was the game of my childhood, you can imagine the hype when I saw my fav band featured in 2.   
---
The concert was great and the quest for the instruments too
---
I don't like having easy or story modes for existing raids. That's a flawed concept on it's own because you either need to design the content for raider and scale it down, or you design it for non-raider and scale it up. Both will result into not really satisfying encounters.
---
The big issue for most people who are not willing to raid is, that you always have three bosses in each instance. If you sign up for a raid it's not only for one encounter you can try over and over again. You sign up for a series of encounters. And some people just don't have enough time for this. It also becomes toxic when a raiding party wipes constantly at boss 1 from 3. Something that would much less happen if there is only 1 boss to fight.
---
I think the right way to do raiding in GW2 from now on is, abandoning the "every raid needs to have 3 boss encounter" concept. Design single boss raids that are still no pushover and in return, release them more frequently. I really believe that Arena Net could release raids with one single encounter at least with every LW episode. Maybe even faster during current events. They don't need to be easier by default because this is something the gameplay design will handle anyways. Depending on mechanics, some people will find raid A easier than raid B. With splitting raids from 3 boss encounters to one, while also releasing them faster, chances are high that everyone who is interested into raiding will find their perfect entry point sooner or later.
---
But just making them easier for the sake of having easy content in the game? Not really a good idea...
---
While the whole process of selling off the shards is definitely fishy, I did learn a lot from the video, especially the idea of always turning your mats into something else before thinking about TPing them away. It's gotten me to look into daily timegated crafting and other refinements which has definitely changed my view on extremely common mats such as Mithril, Elder wood, and even bloodstone/Dragonite/Empyreal
---
&gt; It might be faster than a person listing it themselves, but if you spend the time to collect the other items, then what's a little time on the TP? And they might be able to list it for a better price than the average player could, but is the difference between that price and the price the average player would get large enough to eat up the entire cut the trader gets?
---
I personally completely agree that a bit time spent on the trading post will be worth their while but thats just because I know my way around and they may not.
---
The traders will probably pay at least 10% less for all the mats and will most likely also be able to sell it for 10% more because they are fine with holding it for a couple of weeks, if neccessary.
---
OP also quite underestimates the amount of work that goes into the deal on the traders side. I had someone else craft a legendary once for me (right before pof), just to experience how a deal for outsourcing legendary weapon crafting works in detail to be able to give advice as a moderator of the exchange.
---
It probably takes around 2-3 hours you have to put into it, procuring all the tradeable mats, finding a forger, mailing stuff and explaining stuff. 
---
And 40-60g per hour isnt really that high a ratio for trading to be honest. I have better ratios on regular flipping/investing without the hassle of going around the TP, dealing with buyers/sellers personally and the risk of being scammed.
---
Some people have fun doing map completions, wvw and dungeons on different alts and are very efficient at it and some have fun and are efficient at trading, so obviously personal milage varies in both departments.
---
If someone thinks they dont get enough gold for their account bound currencies, they can ask fora higher price or do it themselves.
---
But the truth is that there are enough players that are happy to sell their account bound mats at the current rates.
---
I am really not sure why these guys are getting scrutinized for doing what they do. They are up front with the process, the recipes arent their own but public knowledge and we all engage in a single market via the TP, so prices are the same for everybody at any point in time.
---
They're not owed a receptive audience for their opinion.
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I personally completely agree that a bit time spent on the trading post will be worth their while but thats just because I know my way around and they may not.
---
Maybe, but then we're back to "these trader guys are profiting off of other players stupidity, rather than being honest with them." If it's a bad deal, then it's a bad deal. It's not a better deal just because they don't *understand* that it's a bad deal.
---
&gt;It probably takes around 2-3 hours you have to put into it, procuring all the tradeable mats, finding a forger, mailing stuff and explaining stuff. 
---
Is that per item, or can they juggle multiple deals over that timeframe? It really shouldn't be taking that long per item, they should have a production flow going if they're doing this as seriously as they indicate. 
---
&gt;And 40-60g per hour isnt really that high a ratio for trading to be honest. I have better ratios on regular flipping/investing without the hassle of going around the TP, dealing with buyers/sellers personally and the risk of being scammed.
---
It's pretty good for anything that *doesn't* involve the markets. This should be recognized as a red flag to you.
---
&gt;If someone thinks they dont get enough gold for their account bound currencies, they can ask fora higher price or do it themselves.
---
This is the issue, most players do not know the value of their account bound currencies, because they specialize in **playing the game,** not in researching the markets. So since they are acting with incomplete knowledge, they are easily taken advantage of by those who do focus on buying and selling things rather than **playing the game.** 
---
This is a bad thing. 
---
I should not have to point this out.
---
&gt;I am really not sure why these guys are getting scrutinized for doing what they do. They are up front with the process, the recipes arent their own but public knowledge and we all engage in a single market via the TP, so prices are the same for everybody at any point in time.
---
Because the process that these guys use is far more profitable than any gameplay activity the game currently offers. I don't entirely fault people for abusing a broken system, but I do fault the broken system for existing. 
---
If one class in PvP can deal 10 times the DPS as any other class, with no penalties, then I don't exactly blame any players who run that class, but I do expect ANet to fix it at some point. If achieving those numbers require a very specific and non-obvious build combo, and no other combo provides the same impact, then I might resent a handful of min-maxers who figured it out and didn't tell anyone, but just quietly kept dominating every match they played.
---
/u/Monstrum27 is responsible for the Horny Legion.
---
Still sounded pretty flirty.
---
Well, if you care about having linked story, then getting some parts sooner than others is helpful, but as you say you play through HoT and PoF simultaneously, that's probably not big issue xD
---
Season 3 for HoT, Season 4 for Pof both have positions that they build upon the systems in expansion, you are supposed to have all, or at least most of masteries done when you start them. So if you don't have expansions alone done, you can postpone the seasons for a bit.
---
Yet, Season maps do have quite easily obtainable ascended equipment, mainly rings, amulets, accessories, so if you want to get those asap (for example you try to climb up into higher fractal tiers already), then it is good idea to not postpone it too much. While fractlas and such can grant you same equipment there, it is usually good idea to save fractal tokens for infinite potions, and use map currencies to get it instead.
---
When you say you are half way through both expansion stories you have likely spoilered yourself for season 3 already. So "worth" in terms of story is probably only season 4. Its also the best season to earn some gold. Season 2 is not really worth it imo except for achievements. Season 3 can be worth for getting ascended trinkets quite easily. If you are mir dedicated towards ascended stuff i would try fractals and raids as well.
---
It absolutely would be because with berserker stats you can take invigorating precision and faceroll. At 20k hp this means you have stats wasted on hp whereas every single stat on berserker will help you do more damage and therefore increase your healing from invigorating precision.
---
Good on him. But that doesn't prove that Xushin doesn't map complete in 9 hours.
---
Then go ahead and make your own MMO. this is sadly a fact of the markets. You have incredibly impatient people who will sell an item instantly, they dont care that they lost 20g they got 35g, This will *always* lead to a market that can be exploited, if you have 500k items congrats, now you have 500k items to flip. You can completely tank your economy like Runescape where people have billions of gold and rare items are worth quite a few billion because gold rains down or you can limit it with sinks, making 300,000 a shit load. Taking out the manipulation and profit will mean no market, period.
---
Thanks!!
---
I don't know how to answer this other than: yeah, me too. I would have loved to see a change...
---
?? My comment saying that we would get has much story content was downvoted to oblivion before the patch.
---
People weren't expecting shit even story wise. Which may be why everyone is so please with this part of the patch.
---
thanks
---
I specifically meant *within* the capitalist market and society itself. Which capitalist countries ran *themselves* into the ground as opposed to getting screwed over by someone else who got lucky or was better at capitalism?
---
Mind you "free market economy" probably describes what I mean better than "capitalism", definitely not thinking of modern loans and stock brokering. Alternatives would include Soviet-style "planned economy" and most forms of aristocracy/hereditary oligarchy where a small number of entities consciously dictate the production and distribution.
---
If u aggro so much it is your fault. Chose different spot
---
I don't think your example is correct, even if it's a huge simplification. The value of skilled labor translates into a higher quality product sold at a higher price, the basic difference is that there is no propetary class benefiting from it by taking a higher margin, because it's the workers who own the means of production.

Sounds like a you problem then.

I can bet with Arena_Net that they had around 10-20k online players on LS5 prologue release day.

This also woefully fails to take into account what the Employer brings to the table, the risks they undertake.

It's basically impossible to have money and trading as we know it in the game without some version of this existing with it.
---
TEKKIT U MADMAN TY AGAIN !
---
Playing everyday, didnt watch trailer. 
---
ERP3 had 17k viewers, are there 17k raiders? i doubt it. Viership does not correlate directly to the actual playerbase of any game. Some games have high viewership with a lower amount of players like sc2 and some have a high population with a lower viewership like gw2
---
It is not exactly a scam, but it is arguably exploitative, for sure. Basically, consider that if spirit shards (time) is so valuable, you should be paid more for them.
---
&gt; it's a major landmark from GW1:EotN.
---
I'm quite looking forward to someone doing the comparison album/video.
---
They put infusion into the Vault that you can unlock once per day if you did 4 major events...so ye, I guess people will repeating it :^)
---
High population of gw2 is a myth
---
&gt; Then go ahead and make your own MMO. 
---
That's a pretty big jump from "This is a good game, but could be doing some things a bit better."
---
&gt;You have incredibly impatient people who will sell an item instantly, they dont care that they lost 20g they got 35g, This will always lead to a market that can be exploited, if you have 500k items congrats, now you have 500k items to flip. 
---
I don't know. One way to fix that would be to limit the amount of flipping you'd be capable of doing to an amount reasonable for an average player. Perhaps clamp down on active sell orders and buy orders, funneling people into "buy it now" pricing if they move over a certain volume in a given amount of time. 
---
I'm sure there are ways that could be done better, but it would take a "good guy flipper" to figure out how best to ruin his own day. 
---
&gt;Taking out the manipulation and profit will mean no market, period.
---
So long as people can put up items they farmed, but do not need, and other players can find items that they need, but did not farm, it'll work out.
---
Could also just be people who don't care about PvE. Just saying.
---
Did you count? :D
---
Awesome, thanks for the confirmation!
---
Me too.
---
Seems that others came ahead of me and gave you the answer xD I did not even think about the time when humans stole charr lands. As to the Vanguard, when they first arrived in those terrirtories they were bases more on hit and run tactics and sneaky camps( back when Lagmar's unit was ambushed and stuff). Since gw1 was not such a dynamic world implementation wise, its hard to see in game that ascalonians did indeed established themselves there during several periods of time ( altough that ended during Adelberns reign, so they might have not been there for that many years).
---
Nor log in to their mail account because many like me do not mix my personal mail account with a game account. So i rarely log in to my mail except for the times when i have too so the mail do not go inactive.
---
I feel like if you're the kind of player who can say "I have multiple builds for my character," then you're probably already beyond the average player of the game. So the strike mission probably isn't meant for you. It's meant for the people who never really bothered venturing into the group content and who need a step above zerging WBs to get them thinking about raids. 
---
My hope is that they release more strike missions with each release that incrementally add mechanics and difficulty. I would hate for them to just jump to something that actually requires 10 people to defeat, because that will alienate a lot of the player base right now and will pretty much defeat the purpose of them.
---
There are only about 4 JPs that can't be skipped
---
 In the video they clearly state it's up to the commanders to form these communities on their own. If you think the end goal is to farm account bound mats to sell them on exchange is the end game, you missed the point. They laid out pretty clearly what they do, touched on how to break into the market, and even said the reason red was able to rack up 20k in 2 months is because his raid guild was behind him selling and crafting together.  Yeah the guys at the bottom aren't making out nearly as much as the guys at the top, but it's still a lot more money than the majority of players in this game are making. Most people just let Shards and karma stack if they can turn that into a bit of money, and help put some more high end items into the market it's a win win. 
---
I've never made much money in guild wars 2, but back in guild wars 1 I had a similar system set up and made a tremendous amount of money. It just seemed much less "black market" because we had a direct trade option.   I made up a simple buy / sell price list I kept constantly updated, and gave it out to about 40 friends / guild members.  They knew at any given time what I would pay for an item, and would come straight to me to sell their materials instead of going to kamadan themselves saving a tremendous amount of time for a ~7%  convenience cost.  If any of them or their friends needed materials I could sell to them at lower than market rate to keep the materials moving. That average 3-5% profit made a tremendous amount of gold when I was moving multiple stacks of ectos, Z keys, shards, arms, and other sought after items a day. The guys I had farming "for me" weren't poor, no they weren't making anywhere near the money I was, but they were still happy to have a reliable method of offloading their materials without standing around all day. To keep them coming back I'd give them  bonuses, kept an eye out, and even bought specific items they were looking for, usually at no cost to them.  If they wanted to get "in on the action" I was pretty transparent about my methods, because like these guys, the more "barons" I had connections with the easier the things I needed were to come by. Even then I was still a "small fry" compared to some others I encountered, who had me more baffled with their wealth than I am with the idea of someone having ~1.5 million gold in GW2.
---
The reason I was never able to reproduce it in Gw2 was I never had a substitute for direct trading (completely oblivious to using the guild bank as a method), and the 15% TP tax absolutely obliterates any profits that there are to be made trading for the layman. 
---
TLDR: pay closer attention, farming isn't the end goal, I was making about 500k a day in GW1 using similar methods.
---
&gt;Tying all income to playtime would mean people who can farm hours a day would have control over other players. 
---
I don't see how. They might have more *stuff* than the average player, but if they worked harder at the game then there's no reason they shouldn't. Players who don't work as long would have less stuff, but no less than they currently have. The only people who would have less would be the market barons, and yeah, that's a feature.
---
I play gw2 and I like new episode. It's really well-done. New map is great and I am glad they abaddoned raids because strike mission is much better.
---
The one guy just said he would give people (he trusted) T5 mats through guild bank and have them promoted to T6 mats and pay for that. Not all of this other stuff.
---
I like that a lot!
---
I have HoT and PoF only for now. LS3 and 4 are on my "plan to buy" list. Somehow I have LS2 but I don't recall buying it

looks reeally nice. It has the same bug as the stingray though where the water effect is always placed at a fixed position relative to the player. The water splashes are created above the surface instead of the water level. (Probably a nightmare to fix)
---
I loved the dialogue between an esteemed asura historian talking about the war for Ascalon, and the charr "corrects" him that it should be called the Ascalonian insurrection or something
---
My one nit-pick would be that it feels like half the map is voiced by Braham.
---
So, arcdps and d912pxy aren't working together, I get insane load times and am unable to do anything in-game except use task manager to force close game. d912pxy works by itself, arcdps works by itself (although it spams error log with an error I can't recall off the top of my head), using none of the two works fine, but combined I get like maybe 1 frame per 10-20s (not exaggerating). With what little movement I had I tested in mistlock, aerodrome, and in bloodstone fen, same thing everywhere. Anyone know what's up?
---
&gt;I hope that puts this all into perspective for everyone. I won’t argue that its a great way to spend your existing resources, and if you want to make a quick buck trading out your currencies, go for it. Just know someone else is on the other end, profiting while doing nothing, and that doesn't sit right with me.
---
But that's real life. There are people who own a business, and people who work for that business owner.  In literally every single instance the owner of that business is making money off the work of their employees. Sure, the business owner works, and the employee makes a living as well. 
---
But the business owner also absorbs all the risks, same as the people you described.  Once the materials are sold, that player has to sell the Legendary.  If they don't, or can't get it at the price they needed, they break even or lose money
---
Nothing of what you described is a 'sham' or nefarious in any way - it is simply reality.  If a person doesn't like being "an employee", then step up and decide to be an owner instead.
---
Have you tried the new strike mission? And if so, did you enjoy the difficulty level?
---
maybe you commented that on a thread that wasn't talking about the quality of the story and people downvoted you because your comment wasn't relevant to the discussion
---
"Aftermath" kinda sounds like you missed the main event. Not sure what the context for S3 is supposed to be, the leyline overload?
---
Well, the East side of the wardowns was where Kralk was taking his nap after all, of course it's changed :D.
---
I immediately recognized some bits, like the old bridge over the water in the south-west corner, the valley in the middle of the forest, the ooze pit ruins. The norn lodge that used to be the passage into the shiverpeaks. Hell, even that area where you find the ebon vanguard ambushed and captured was there. All these things I caught on pretty quickly even without seeing the GW1 area for literally years.
---
Doomlore I was wondering if it was in the right spot, it seems like it might be right, but that it might be shifted over a little? It's hard to tell but then I remembered it was north of Kralk, and the landscape (an upward slope) fit.
---
This is totally wrong, views dont mean active playerbase. While i do not have the actual numbers, yours is just a ridiculous assumption. 
---
And looking at your previous posts who all got deleted by automod for false/misleading or marked trolling, i wonder how long it would take with this one.

I feel he does it in such a condescending way that it sounds like mockery

 I joined their discord almost maybe 7 months ago- and was given the good ole song and dance referenced in Wooden Potatoes video. I mainly play WvW, and as many people here know- it's not exactly profitable! So to maintain my standing within that game mode- I make and sell legendarys. Having done this since core, I wasn't interested in the process offered as what I do is far more profitable on my own. 
---
What I did learn that evening however - and this came from one of the participants his video- Is they used to do this same process in WvW. 
---
WvW players have a good amount of spirit shards- what they lack is gold. So this community has been having these players make them legendarys, and in exchange they were given gold, and transfers to heavily stacked servers- Causing the massive population imbalance that we still today. 
---
These are the same people - not different people- the same people-  they are now just choosing to target PvE players,  probley because the WvW community is almost non existent - and this is my personal opinion-
---
 I believe this process had a hand in the collapse of the WvW community, and one of the main reasons why Anet decided to work on an alliance system - this way they will be able to control the population. 
---
If people choose to sell off their map completions or spirts shards- that's up to their discretion. However I'm not a fan, and it's far more profitable to just utilize these items on your own.
---
You just described every job in a capitalist economy. You will never get the full value of your labour working for a company. 
---
Here just like in a regular capitalist system, the people with power and money will abuse the labour of others to turn a profit themselves.
---
Thanks for the recap! This is stuff I really can't remember after \~6 years.
---
How many of them are other mmo players which makes memes of gw2?
---
Can someone please link where exactly Anet said that strike missions will increase in difficulty as Icebrood Saga progresses
---
Season 2: The Mordrem Saga
---
Season 3: The Mursaat Saga
---
Season 4: The Branded Awakened Saga
---
okay on a more serious note:
---
S2: Wastes and revelations
---
S3: Consumers of Magic
---
S4: Death and Rebirth
---
Got it!  Replied.
---
A new character select screen with QoL options would *definitely* suggest that whole "expansion level content in Living World" thing.  
---
Y'know, properly aligning characters to the viewable space, faster search options, sort functions.
---
That is like saying that everyone walking by a Picture are also associated with that picture.
---
You don't need anything else than a bunny with high jump (although it's easier with bond of faith and/or skyscale).
---
They have GMs on here too, right? 
---
What would you do assuming you won't get an answer for let's say two more weeks? You are not allowed to open another ticket, so what exactly are the options you have?
---
I think they transposed the 2 hour Tyrian day onto a 24 hour schedule.
---
If they are cutting costs to such an extend that this kind of work isnt worth it anymore, the game has a problem.
---
It's only a fair exchange if you believe a capitalist system is inherently fair.
---
From where I'm standing, the fact that your boss gets to abuse your labour is an inherently unfair system. Same with this. It's not a scam. It's just unethical, because capitalism is unethical. Seize the means of production comrades!
---
we mean the ingame mail. they send the link with that system this time
---
There will likely be a new portal tome released with episode 1 when the saga properly starts. This is a prologue not an actual episode even though it feels like one.
---
&gt; their reasons do seem sketchy
---
not really, their reason is to make money. they just do it by paying the absolute minimum, and this video looks to me like an attempted advertisement (not by WP) to drive down the prices on their supply by creating more suppliers
---
A lot of SH pugs use 2 healers AND scourge.
---
The tome came with the second episode in LS4 as well, so we will probably see one with the "official" episode 1 of LS5 ;)
---
For them they have gotten the t5’s cheaper than current listing prices, either through trades, market dips etc. Since they are using the materials, they don’t sell the T6, which makes it worthwhile. Again, if spirit shards were valued correctly by them (which they aren’t) this wouldn’t be viable for them.
---
deny?
---
Wish I could say the same for the male Charr voice.  A few months back I decided to take my WvW Rev, who had finished personal story only, and start up PoF story for fun, and boy was that change a shock to the system.
---
Well I wouldn't go to something outside the actual service that can help.   
---
Especially when it's in the thread rules.
---
Confused as to your comment here.   Are you saying there isn't a long wait to start events?   If it's a bug then I hope they fix it.
---
That's the /r/wallstreetbets attitude!
---
I am huge fan of Guild Wars 2 but it doesn't mean that I will lie to myself (like you do) about it's popularity.
---
I don't think so. See the the "trivia" section [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_3_Portal_Tome).
---
The time it takes to get map completion/dungeon currency is insanely exaggerated in this post. With TACO and mounts you can get world completion done in 10 hours EASY.
---
Dungeon currency is limited by whether you have a group to do daily clears or not. But 68 hours is grossly exaggerated.
---
And if it isnt popular, what does that mtter?
---
I'm pretty sure the Season 4 portal tome was released before episode 2, because I bought it in Istan before then
---
Yes please!
---
I think it would be a nice touch to help get people on board with the idea that this is indeed just as good as an expansion, but spread out and in more digestible pieces.
---
Good game is still good so it's population don't matter that much until we have fun.
---
But we got one with ls 4.1
---
This is exactly what I thought the moment they talked about mat conversions.
---
They are manipulating the masses to make more money.
---
Since the Masteries are still purple and the story still in the "purple highlighted" subsection under PoF perhaps not yet :( But I agree Im tired of Balthazar staring at my email.
---
Then you just turned the game into a boring grindfest. And that's where bots will shine. 
---
Even if that was not the case, trying to go full meritocratic is likely to make new players turn away. Everyone is a casual player when beginning. And then they wouldn't be as rewarded as hardcore players with lots of time to farm and polish their skills, and would tend to be shunned away from group content (since they can't keep up with gear treadmill or specific knowledge).
---
Plenty new in locations we visit no. How they look 250 years later, yes. But basically every area of the world we go to has been visited in some way back in GW1. We rarely visit something never before seen in GW1.
---
Surely if it's done via trades, current market prices are used as a guide so they won't be getting them 'cheaper', just for items rather than gold? Would they be able to obtain enough T5 materials to burn through all of their spirit shards?
---
Would you consider taking their offer of 60g for 140 of my spirit shards seems reasonable, rather than doing conversions myself? I guess it obviously depends on how long it takes to do the conversions, but it seems for the average player spirit shards ARE worthless.

I'll make it: the GW2 Reddit community is overly salty and just needs to keep digging for something to bitch about.
---
Say what you will about the Charr, but soldiers know how to "huddle for warmth." }]:3
---
It's not a scam. You still have to sell the legendary. It's a ripoff but no one's forcing you.
---
This only works if the item meets certain conditions (like high enough buy price etc.), because the calculations of efficiency were changed to make manipulations more difficult.
---
I'm an active player of GW2 and I didn't watch the trailer. It got released on the same day as the LS itself. Thus obviously I went on to play the new story and don't spoil me with the trailer!
---
&gt;sort functions

Lord yes. I'd much prefer either to leave all my characters in a set order or be able to drag and drop them in the order I choose, rather than log them in and hope they go next in line.
---
I think Tengu are pretty cool
---
Ya'll are too funny
---
Yep. 
---
This community has become way too salty and has to stretch for more things to bitch about.
---
They go on sale periodically and I'd say they're the best things on the gem store. Definitely worth through HoT and PoF though

---
He's probably going to become recongised. For now he's acting imperator, but I guess there are some tribunes, who don't recongise his authority. The three other legions are propping him up and his rivals lack manpower. Efram took female charr into active service in part because the other legions pressured this, but also because it bolsters his numbers. Not to mention a charr, male or female, is a very powerful creature of Tyria.
---
I don't envy him for his title. Leading a country out of a defeat, having to endure your rivals constantly trying to undermine you, having to normalise relations with your former enemies, he has his work cut out for him.
---
All good
---
Rytlok Trombone becomes god of Tyria.
---
Yes it is good.
---
I tried that as well, I saw a post suggesting the same thing! Unfortunately, when I joined their party, it made THEIR 'queue for unranked' button stop working. As soon as I left the party, they were able to queue again.
---
no, that's globalism. capitalism works on medium scales.
---
some asshole store owner demanding outrageous prices? in a medium market, you can vote with your wallet and go to a competitor.  
---
once globalism enters the picture, the seller doesn't care anymore about one lost sale because for every person who leaves there's more suckers lined up.

Oooh. I do use Chrome too. So that perfect. Yeah the new setup for Reddit is really bad to look at and move around.

Thanks. :)

My Springer couldn’t fully charge its jump. After the patch it was fine, though

Switch to a zerker/assassin mix daredevil. Take the heal on crit trait. Dodge staff2 AA chain Dodge staff2 AA chain. You're literally unkillable. If you're still killable use the mintberry ice cream food for MORE HEAL ON CRIT. Maybe ditch scholar runes and switch to a defensive rune like vaparism(more heals) or daredevil(More crits). Everything is suddenly dead. 🤔
---
it's really odd to put that information there when there is no actual in-game clock.

LOLWUT When did i insult you????

Crispin Freeman had a TinierMe promotional account. RIP TinierMe.

Here comes what could be a mis-researched question, but are all male and female \[race\] voices the same, regardless of profession?

I.e. is my male Asura Engineer voiced by the same dude that a male Asura Warrior or Thief would be?

Its part of Path of Fire though.

One of the events starts every 30 min in the same order so all you need to remember is to check the event areas at x:10 and x:40 or keep an eye on chat where an npc will announce the upcoming event.
---
Same. Waited a while for this and I didn't even finish the map before getting bored. At least I got the new bow and mount skin in just 5 keys.
---
&gt; just overheal it
---
What's there to overheal? You can't even get downed if you go in there solo as full glass ele.
---
I don’t think it’s that. Quite a bit of efforts seems to have gone into the content of the prologue.
---
This is intended it seems.
---
Youngling will go back to The Light Side  and then consecutively will become new emperor.
---
Eirsson? More like Eir's son, amirite fellas?
---
I'm really starting to like him
---
Classic log out and log back in scenario. Worked for me at least. Sad if you log into another map instance and can’t get the loot anymore.
---
There is a new downstate skill that makes pew?
---
I really need a mini of that dude!
---
I mean after they changed tact with PoF by not giving gold challenges mastery points it seems like a step back forcing non-WvW/PvPers into a gamemode they don't or can't play to get an Emote. Usually the arguement is the other way around; forcing WvW/PvPers to play PvE content (which they also have to do to unlock the track in the first place).
---
Personally I hate JPs and timed ones... I 'despise' them. And it is kind of insulting to the meta-AP,  reducing my reason to stay, when I can just use 80 potions to skip the content. I've ended up with 1 weapon, 3 of the four banners (and able to buy the 4th by roaming to the right event) and the shirt already in less than a day. But my enthusiasm is drained and one friend who's a little cheesed off because they absolutely hate timed JPs more than I do. Neither of us have the reactions needed to complete them in the artificial 'pressure-cooker' environment of timed encounters.
---
Story always has a green marker on the floor at the end, where you can just press F to get out. That's how you can not ever learn how to use the instance leave button.
---
&gt; Clayton: They're an extreme time commitment. Sometimes it's really hard to even get a bunch of friends together, right? Different time zones, like all different types of stuff like that so we're introducing a public mode with this which will allow you to group up to people in the map looking for the same boss that you're trying to take out. So we're really excited about that and, let's see, with prologue we're actually introducing the first one which is this Icebrood construct. Yeah, it's right behind me. **Super scary, but what's interesting about this guy is he's going to evolve from the prologue to episode one.** So not only in his model, but also in his game mechanics as well and then in episode one, back to Lovecraftian horror that you were speaking to Jason, we're going to introduce this thing called a "boneskinner" and this thing is terrifying. It's going to haunt you. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
I think that is the bit that people are talking about.
---
Maybe it's a time crunch thing.  Crew had to all get together between work shifts so it was more of a let's get this done thing.  Was there a way to tell when exactly events were starting?  I know the event schedule boards would point you to where but I couldn't find exact timers and everything took 10-15 minutes at least to start :(
---
Sad part for me is I remember when we all started GW2 and loved doing what you did but then things got hectic and we are simply trying to keep up while still having fun and playing the game - not waiting to play an event while we wait for work.  Honestly rather of had hearts instead of timers so we could of run in completed them and been on our way.  Thank you for your experience though!
---
I agree and I hate the PoF character selection screen and music it's so low energy compared to HoT
---
Completely disagree, in dungeons you at least have to play the game (excluding Main Scenario) while in Dragonfall my main Gameplay is moving around the map and pressing 1. Different opinions are fine tho :D
---
he wants to bring jormag under his control, jormag laughs at him and corrupts his whole army---&gt; frost legion.
---
&gt;my main Gameplay is moving around the map and pressing 1.
---
That's a personal choice.
---
In dungeons, I could get by doing an ice-mage rotation in FFXIV and pull abysmal DPS, but I don't. Same in Dragonfall, I pull 10-25k DPS depending on how long things live, because doing rotations is more fun than pressing 1.
---
I'm sorry, does anyone this translate to real money?
---
The humans are Orc of GW2 They were send to Tyria, Balthazar said "Ya guys best let beat crap out of Charr". They did, they pushed Charr back.
---
Charr did wrong, but humans started it.
---
PS) If this isn't allowed, I apologize. I just REALLY wanted these songs to blast in my car. If and when they become available I am definitely purchasing them.
---
I'm planning to get some unbreakable tools soon, and wanted to get a few nice glyphs as well. For logging and mining, I'm considering two of the VM, UM and Sprocket glyphs. 
---
Which ones would be better? I'm still needing to buy some ascended trinkets so either VM or UM would be nice. But then, Sprockets could be sold for some side profit as well (either as raw mats or after crafting).
---
&gt; But seriously, nobody noticed how shitty the textures are compared to LS4 or PoF ones? It's screaming GW2 Vanilla.
---
That bothers me too but I have hopes for the first real EP. If nothing changed by then it's obvious that they're on a small budget.
---
&gt; Perhaps clamp down on active sell orders and buy orders, funneling people into "buy it now" pricing if they move over a certain volume in a given amount of time.  
---
The problem with this is its detrimental to the core game. People who have never flipped at all can drop 10-50k mithril ore, silk scrap etc. on the market, if they want to fuel an expensive purchase that is, so do you limit some markets? All of them? How about the people who put 15+ hours on average every day, will that impact them? What about hardcore farmers? Then you'll have crafting to balance as you have caps on the market, people will start flipping and driving up markets that either have a large volume or a tiny volume but a tiny supply. The fact is if you have any sort of player owned market there will be people who exploit it, in an MMO you are going to have hundreds of thousands of items, each one *will* be profitable and each one *will* be exploited. If you want a healthy economy that doesnt absolutely punish new players you'll want the ebb and flow as its overall good.  
---
&gt; So long as people can put up items they farmed, but do not need, and other players can find items that they need, but did not farm, it'll work out.  
---
That's exactly what happens now in most MMOs yet you will always have that volatile market because yet again, people are impatient.
---
Really? Well I need another gift of exploration. Do you have a link to the TACO markers I can give it a try this week/weekend.
---
Down with the capitalist pig 1%! Up with the blue and green farmers!
---
In addition to what Megiddo said, it sounds like "Nice ass", so it functions as a double entendre.
---
It's absolutely amazing.
---
jfc, I had to turn down my volume 70% just to be able to do it. No idea how you can ramp that up
---
Glad you all like it. The french VO, on the other hand, has seen a steep decline in this episode imo. Mistranslations galore, lines which finish too quickly (so the animated character still speaks for a few seconds while the voice has finished)...
---
They are usually not bad at this, but in this episode it really looks like it was rushed.
---
but that wouldn't fit the made-up narrative :(
---
Upvoting for touhou
---
I feel like this is getting old.
---
&gt; I think this is a less stressful way to learn general mechanics of raids 
---
What mechanics would those be? I don't see anything here that is raid specific at all. I guess the boss has two phases, although they're not terribly different. That's all I can think of, and even that exists in personal story stuff and fractals.
---
My experience also tells me that people will simply not actually learn stuff if they don't need to in order to succeed. Heck this is even true for actual raiders, like an awful lot of raiders won't learn how to do another role or the broader structure of the fight, as long as they can keep doing what they've already learned and succeed. Fractals are another example of this. Players have all through tier 1 and 2 to "learn" fractals, but when you start joining tier 3 fractals where you actually need to know the fights somewhat, everything is a total mess. Tier 3, where the mechanics can wipe you, is where people actually learn fractals.
---
&gt; It's true that you won't beat a raid boss in the first go just by doing this one, or probably any of them, but I don't think that's the point. 
---
I would go so far as to say it's the actual point of raids themselves that you won't beat it on the first attempt. So I don't think anyone really had this view.
---
&gt; I think the point is to show casual players that raids don't have to be scary things,
---
I honestly think if someone thinks raids are scary, then tries this and it's okay, and then tries actual raiding they will go back to being scared lol. At least a decent amount of the time. This instance asks absolutely nothing of you and even the easiest of raids ask something, like say a functional (not necessarily meta) build. This really seems like false advertising. I dunno though, maybe that's the intention. You lure them in so they at least try it with this stuff and then when they experience the real thing, maybe they like it even though it's super different to this.
---
&gt; That way if they jump into a PUG group they still may wipe, but at least they aren't struggling to understand what their role in the party should be, etc. I don't think you do that just by scattering various mechanics in other modes where players don't really have to work together as a team.
---
I don't see this strike at least doing anything of the sort like that. You don't need support or healers or tanks. You don't need people with builds focused on CC or DPS. You don't have specific roles that people need to fulfill in the fight like kiting or killing adds. I think that to some extent, tequatl teaches that sort of thing better than this does! In fairness, an awful lot of people ignore that stuff on tequatl, but I think that reinforces my earlier point.
---
Snargle Goldclaw's books will leave a controversial fan following and create the foundation of a hot new genre of Tyrian literature. Generations of scholars will spend hours analysing the intricate wordplay of this revolutionary author and the deeper meaning of his writing.
---
If you have a connection like Xushin and MM from WvW, you can make as many deals a day that you want. I've done a few with MM he told me he does about 10 a day. 125g profit off of 10 people, is a good chunk of change. 
---
This basically only works if you have a lot of people you trust. 
---
This is capitalism 101 and they are vague as fuck when they talk about it. They just know how to hype people into making money.
---
Yeah, Icebrood saga is our only chance to get some Shiverpeaks - inspired main theme (maybe a mixture of Charr and Norn) and a new menu screen. I really hope they are considering it. I am so tired of looking at the dreary PoF menu and the music is pretty but doesn't get me pumped much.
---
It took them a few days to respond to a ticket I had regarding a payment that didn’t go through correctly. Don’t worry; it takes a bit of time.
---
Yeah.  Requests may have been that low but when I listed mine there wasn't a single one of any type available for purchase, so I listed them at 40g and they sold within minutes.  This was before anyone knew what was behind the doors.
---
This book is *so* illegal!
---
Oh bummer. It’s so silly to have a Balthazar launcher and an Elonian character screen when we’re in the middle of the Shiverpeaks dealing with Jormag and Charrs....
---
Its pretty bad. Worst story telling of the big 4.
---
Just wait for Episode 1 where we get a norn viking metal concert.
---
Alot of rich people are very transparent with how they make money. Souls for example (one of gw2 exchange admin) will tell you openly what he does.
---
Some other people like sam and zanar posted videos about methods of tp flipping.
---
And most of the rich people do raid sells. Okimi (, one of the 3 people in the video) is the raid leader of [Ren], a raid selling guild.
---
I spent alot of time with the monocle club (even tho im dirt poor) and they're really nice people.
---
I feel like a lot of people here didn't watch the video. They make it pretty damn clear that the guy at the end of the process makes the most profit per hour invested. They even detail the process of why your shards are worth money and different ways you can (and should) monetize them yourself. The scheme in this video is not how the profits add up or the content, it is market manipulation.
---
That being said... They are clearly trying to flood the market with shards so that they can lower their value all while increasing the amount of available deals. Also potential massive profits from T5 mats being bought up post video. They might have huge stores of T5/T6 mats that they bought in a dip, this video comes out, prices inflate, they sell. Textbook market manipulation.
---
There's a skill that lets you pew pew while dead?
---
Yeah exactly so they're certainly also 5man lmao
---
That's Snargle Gutslurper. Different warband. Blood Legion. Does anyone know this Goldclaw's Legion? Sounds like Flame Legion.
---
To be fair, that is a genuine issue.
---
Say you die early and are getting bored. There's literally no way to quit until the group wipes or kills the boss.
---
You completely missed the main point.  Instead of selling on the TP you should look to make a deal directly with another player.  Avoiding the 15% TP tax allows both players to get what they want without any loss.  If I trade a t6 mat for equal value of anything else then neither player has lost anything.  If I sell a t6 mat on the TP in order to buy something else from the TP then both players have lost gold.  Of course they're promoting their way of doing it in order to get more people to trade with which will lead to a more stable economy, this is not a bad thing for anyone.  
---
They also point towards having a higher account bonus for experience and using an experience enrichment as more profitable then gold or karma or magic find.  This is arguable, but if the end goal is being throttled by experience gain then it makes sense.  I suggest having multiple and using the one you need the most.
---
It is aside from the slight bug of the T-Shirt consumable being weighted.
---
It doesn't make sense yet. This prologue is clearly about the setup of the next arc, the arc hasn't started yet. Kickoff happened, but we haven't arrived yet (this is so much better than the LS3 cutscene at the end of Sirens Landing)
---
Not really, I lag hard in Zerks so doing a rota is cancer + most mobs die super fast in Zerks so yeah, and btw I don't mean litterally pressing 1 all the time. In dungeons you have more impact and mechanics to look out for, same with fractals btw in gw2
---
They don’t mention it in the video but rather in discord during one of the leaders ‘lectures’ that he won’t ever write a guide for, but they are the main reason why mystic coins are so damn expensive. They have turned them into a currency for infusions, which is why they spiked, making legendaries that much harder to get for the average player
---
It is! Playing thief too. I was stuck in exactly same part but tried again, again, again, again, again and 10x again until success.
---
Also many boss fights in stories (including living world) usually go like this: My character dies so many times it has 100% broken armor at the end, but I don't care, spawn point is near, and boss does not reset, so I just keep running back.
---
it's always funny to see early prices for these kinds of things.
---
Can you do this on alts who have not done the story, assuming you completed the story on your main?  Curious as to how easy mapping on alts will be.
---
:O 
---
This is gold!!!
---
&gt; The problem with this is that it might take 4-5 episodes to get a boss that has actually some raid-like value. 
---
I completely disagree that this is a problem. Any introduction to raids needs to hold the hands of the players they're designed for, and you simply cannot do that all at once. I don't think you have a good grasp for the gameplay capabilities of the players strike missions are designed for.
---
As I see it, currently it's only there to get these people in and used to doing strike missions, but there are some **basic** takeaways. It's up to 10-man content, on a daily reset, there's a timer that does set a baseline dps to receive max rewards, and nothing more - and that's OKAY. ANet has set an easy to approach baseline, they have incentivized these players to play strike missions with rewards and achievements, and from here they will continue to add \*simple\* and \*approachable\* mechanics as the [encounter evolves over time](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement), and additional encounters are added.
---
The existing tutorialization in GW2 has **failed** these players, so you need to start from nothing. You need to learn addition before you can learn multiplication.
---
Stonks!
---
And because it was drunk Braham, it was never really immersion breaking to me. I had almost the exact same thing happen to me in RL with a friend during a FFDP concert. Plus the barfing into the phone and security that called later to pick him up.
---
Okay, then just do that.
---
They are in EOTN, so maybe the destroyers appear again...
---
Final file of the update downloaded slowly and that single file took nearly 3 minutes to finish. It also seemed to be much bigger than any other files downloaded.
---
After update, the client crashed, a few mins after logging in. Logged back 5 minutes later, played over 2 hours, explored the new map, completed the story and did many achis. Game didn't crash anymore. No lag, no server crashes, no problems.
---
Quaggan is best race
---
that event was wild XD 
---
emotes, wild jumping to fill the hype bar, acting as bouncers, and getting flung into the air by an unexpected boss fight. so metal. XD
---
It isn't a first time playthrough issue because my second account did this stuff before ever touching the story beyond just getting there.  Also not as easily found as min/maxing graphic settings... lowering settings actually only made the marks more visible for me.
---
That mosh pit IS murderous.....
---
Players were jumping up and down while killing crazed fans and sparks.

I’m just referencing the pig mentality of running around like chickens.

I'm already using tekkit's taco route lol

I'm reminded of WoW's early raid finder system. When the expansion Mists of Pandaria first launched, the raid finder bosses were way to easy. The mechanics barely punished the group for failing and most of the bosses could be more or less merged by all but 2-3 people doing the mechanics. As gear inproved, these bosses got even easier. But then I noticed a strange occurrence. Suddenly groups were failing or almost failing bosses. What I deduced as the cause was a shift in people composition. At first, you had dedicated end gamers who intrinsically understood raid mechanics as simple as "don't stand in fire". These people phased out as any potential for progress dwindled in the RF. They were replaced by imbeciles, trolls and just people that did not understand raid mechanics at a fundamental level. Now, I'm not saying that this is a good thing, quite the opposite. That shit was cancer! But it could explain your early success. You just *know* how to deal with raid mechanics and thus you intrinsically master beginner level content instantly.
---
Hopefully they patch it so players WON'T stack on the boss. Thats one of the reasons why I hated rajds in the first place
---
It's because it is getting old.
---
d12pxy is fine for me but not arc
---
I remember when liadri was first introduced. Damn that was fun, cheesable, but if played straight damn fun.
---
You also happen to know where he is when the msg contains a foreign voice and they talking about fighting each other? People in game said he at the rank'n'fight pub west or the map... But i can't seem to find him there. Its the last one i need
---
The only mistake the charr made is not bringing the Olmakhan back into the fold and absorbing them into the legions.
---
Oh look a troll on a month old account and limited history
---
Momentum, Kraul. Once Blood is so powerful that all others fall in line, the niceties can be dropped. But for the moment, there's no risk of dragonbrand in the east, no one there has anything comparable to Blood and their resources can be used to make the charr war machine so powerful that not even an elder dragon can stop it. Who needs Elder dragons, when you get Iron to build you flying copter carriers?
---
Tldr: if you do this, just craft a legendary weapon to sell it by yourself?
---
When sending a ticket to support you get a auto sent ticket to you. This is were you talk to them. Never make a new one, update this ticket if a week already gone by and ask why it taking so long for them to respond.
---
apart from the build comments from others, there is something really powerful on thief. its called "blind".  
---
imagine pulling 5 enemies into some corner and putting down a blindfield with pistol 5 or the utilitie one and then just stay there without getting any damage, working even on those pesky elite mobs.  
---
suddenly 20k hp look like a waste and those sweet zerker stats would let you cleave down those 5 mobs in less then 5 seconds.  
---
for anything else if you still really need it with that many dodges and even the signet heal skill, there is one last option called invigorating precision for those sweet heals.
---

---
So the one area they actually *outdid* raids is the buggy and cancerous entry system. Great.
---
I was disappointed it was just a warhorn and not a scepter, but this is so much more amazing than I thought!

I also got mandragor vibes running through the hills searching for the chili peppers.

Season 2: The Call of the Jungle  
---
Season 3: This one's hard as Balthazar really is the main thread of the story. The Lies and Truth about Magic maybe?  
---
Season 4: The tale of a Lich and a Dragon
---
Same.  "Path of Fire: The Icebrood Saga" just doesn't sit well with me. And I did want a new themed character select screen. Oh well.
---
Oh! Is that the Doomlore Ruins event? I haven't done that one yet, but was looking forward to a Hablion-like reunion. :)
---
Eh... To be fair. This is pretty much what a lot of raids have devolved into
---
A K-Pop concert in Shing Jea with a bunch of Canthan elites just doing "Crazy Rich Asians" things would pretty much personify what SJM became in GW1.
---
giving away our secrets.
---
Yeahhhh, the amount of AP you get for most achievements now is ridiculous; 1-3 AP for decently long stuff. S1 and S2 gave a TON of AP comparatively.
---
Happy upvoting for Touhou! OP is a man of taste
---
The map has volatile magic and is available without you "Owning" the icebrood saga. This is the same as the silverwastes, silverwastes are core tyria, not HoT. This map is PoF, not TIS (The Icebrood Saga)?
---
Season 5: The Icecream Saga
---
&gt; Sure you make a bit of money, quite a lot actually, 
---
awesome, good to know.
---
I really need to check that out.
---
Considering how autocracies act even today its sadly not yet historical...

Love the Touhou reference! XD

[GW2 taco startup guide](http://www.gw2taco.com/2015/12/quick-start-guide.html) and you might want [Tekkir's custom markers.](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) It'll take a bit of getting used to, but once you have it up and running you'll be so much more efficient at finding stuff.
---
Before it would take me a ton of alt tabbing to complete a collection, but with this I can just setup the TACO markers and see exactly where I need to go (even through mountains and textures)
---
Id rather strikes be something else than "raids for casuals" thank you. They have potential. Something I felt raids lost when stacking became the norm for most raids.
---
It is. We defeated two whole new enemies already, joko and kralk, but noooo we have to be reminded of Balth. Isn't the game all about the dragons? 
---
Doesn't help that it was this launcher and char select screen that took out the HoT ones, which I loved.
---
I guess the question becomes: what else are you doing with your resources? Sure, you can eek out better margins doing this over that and such, but are you. They may have had ulterior goals when participating in WP's video, but the truth is that offered public information in a more direct format that would result in individual players making money that they otherwise wouldn't be making. Now, if you want to interject at this point to also inform the masses about how they could be doing something else to make more money, then go for it. I think you are doing a great thing by doing so. But remember that everything is a manipulation, and someone is always trying to exploit you. Perhaps there are people trying to freeze the flow of spirit shards to increase their value and increase their margins. They don't even have to lie to push this point; simply telling people they are being exploited will cause them to clam up and stop using their resource, making yours more valuable. I'm not saying this is the case, but you have to understand that their is no such thing as a truly benignant offering in these cases. And someone's gotta come out on top.
---
Not to mention those (like myself) whi havent had time to play tru the whole thing yet. I garuntee theres at least 10-20k more users on gw2 efficiency in the same boat
---
The camera changes during the story when it first happened was so awkward. I was sitting in a chair because I could there and all I could see was the back of the chair. So I got out of the chair and tried to focus on the stage and it didn't work well. Once I got the camera focused on the speaker it was fine though.
---
Which mats? Just curious cause Ive got a bunch of times I want to convert
---
What? I thought they spiked because they're so limited in how they're obtained in game. It's basically just daily logins and some rng gem sources.
---
Tbh these guys sound like they're role-playing some kind of rich man stock market guru fantasy sometimes with the things they said, they definitely conduct themselves as people who "own" the market.
---
Probably related to this, retrieving the chili currency from mat storage completed the daily for chili gathering 'Daily Grothmar Pepper Picker'
---
That's not the whole reason why they spiked. A major source of Mystic coins was removed and the supply in-flow dropped significantly. Even if they didnt manipulate the price that supply change would have had a huge impact on the price. Assuming you log in every day, every account gets 260 MCs per year. Considering how low they are found outside of that limit they are essentially daily gated. People pay thru the nose to avoid daily gates.
---
It may be not visually practical but given the theme of this new saga, I'd love to see our characters gather around firecamps in the (snowy) background.

Heeeeh not just context. Should I remind you how  PoF and season 4 areas had mobs that could see you from miles and snipe you with 1500 range? This is what, I think, gave those maps a feeling of being overpopulated. I love to jump in areas densely populated but being sniped is not fun.

It takes longer to crash on Wine 3.0 or older but still happens. It was working fine before patch though, so must not be a Wine problem.

So they try to prevent a technological singularity by genocide?
---
Public Strike missions don't even automatically form a squad... we had to do it ourselves even though the game detected and asked all present if we were ready to go.
---
No? Its not a new expansion
---
Did you play Sacred 1 (Gold) though?
---
Getting downvoted for an opinion, how reddit.
---
I agree with you, It was really nice how Taimi was absent, _for a reason_, (it is mentioned she's working on her treatise). 
---
Gorrik is there, but his role isn't manic macguffin provider... He's there out of interest for Charr culture, then gets roped into the story instead of forcibly inserting himself (cough _Taimi_)
---
The new meta events are just heart quests on a timer.
---
Haven't had time to try strike missions until now, but i like what i'm reading so far
---
Where is the big siege devourer boss?
---
There is the Genghis Repeating bow. Which is a bow with an arrow guide that loads like a Winchester Rifle
---
This sounds like innuendo
---
New map vendor
---
Nope, thats exactly what it is sadly. Plus them being used as payment currency for buying raid wings. People who sell raids and raid achievs charge you anything from 300 mystic coins to 1300 for full achievements its INSANE.
---
If there's anything current events have taught me, it's not too underestimate how stupid people can be, especially when they're blinded by ideals and misled by people they should be able to trust.
---
I really liked exploring the beautiful scenery, however the invisible walls kept pissing me off.
---
Everyone seems to be forgetting about migraine challenge mote in HoT end story which was real hard at the time. Frustrating yes but you had to step up, coming from the open world.
---
That, for me, would be a reasonable introduction to strike missions in terms of level.
---
Hey, bro, maybe you should turn off your selective blindness for thirty seconds and re-read the comment:
---
&gt;Basically, I'm pretty sure this isn't the most complex strike mission were going to see. I think this is literally just to get people's feet wet
---
&gt;(assuming there are going to be more and that they start ramping up in difficulty)
---
Stop cherry-picking what to respond to so you can be salty. The entire point of the commend you responded to was that this *wasn't going to be* the standard for every strike mission, but was an introduction to strike missions with the *expectation* that future strikes will steadily increase in difficulty in different stages until they are equivocal to a minor raid boss, having built up confidence along the way.
---
It's posts like yours, in fact, that remind me of why I don't raid in this game, because people like you exist and you ***so badly*** look down on other players that you will find any excuse to diminish their attempts at trying to improve by shouting it down at the top of your lungs. "IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH" it's the first one, you absolute dolt, and the post you chose to shriek in response to *hinged on this fact*.
---
Exactly. Looks really nice. I hope that we will get that one later on too. Would be a waste.
---
I'm guessing it's a money thing. Critical Role cast probably views GW2 as just a job in a long line of jobs. Whereas something like World of Warcraft pays for sponsorships on critical role, so they end up doing work and callouts for them.
---
Not true. In wow and then what sells is gear and skins from instances content. The seller still has to go in and get the item. Not just do literally nothing.
---
If you could sell ascended or legendary gear the market would change for the better.
---
If you hate stacking on the boss you hate Guildwars 2.
---
There are maybe a handful of fights in the entire game where stacking on the boss isn't objectively superior to ranging them down. And those handful usually have mechanics that specifically prevent it, like Jormag before you phase him, or the bounties that sometimes force you to stay at range. 
---
The problem isn't that Anet is bad at designing fights, the problem is that the entire system hardcore incentivises you to stack in one place, because of the way buffs are distributed, the way mob aggro works and, most importantly, the fact that a fuckload of your damage comes from AoE's. If you have AoE's, like Ele magma fountain, or Air overload, or Warrior Thousand Blades (which really is just an AoE in a cone in front of you), then you want the boss to stay in that AoE. So if you have a boss that moves to the person he aggros and he changes aggro, then of course you need to stack on top of it. This is why every dungeon or fractal fight (where aggro is a lot more "random") you pretty much are required to stack on the boss, or you gonna lose half your damage.
---
Ironically raids allow for a lot more variety here. The fact that boss aggro usually is a lot more clear in raids allows for the tank to stay in one place and the rest of the group to stay at range in another spot. This absolutely works perfectly, as can be seen with strats like the "Deimos range" strat. This strat wouldn't work in most dungeons, because a lot of encounters switch aggro seemingly at random.  
---
There are multiple reasons why most group still opt to melee stack, instead of range dps, despite it being possible for almost every encounter. First of all healers usually have to heal the entire group, because of a fuckload of passive damage. Since a lot of healing is done by AoE, stacking in a spot with the tank makes the Druid's job easier, because he doesn't have to heal 2 locations at once, but can sinply focus on one. Also, since buffing is also location dependant, if your group buffer is melee, which most of the time they are, your range dps is, again, incentivised to stack with the group to get the buffs they need. Chrono wells, as well as Druid *Grace of the land* are the big "offenders" here.
---
Bottom line: You will never get rid of "stack on boss", because it is built into the mechanics of the game. If the players in your group are good enough, there isn't a single mechanic that can make "going range" worth the loss in dps. You can make them move, sure, but you'll *always* want to stay on the boss.
---
Total noob here. How does one sell batch 2 legendary like astralaria or something. I know that the older ones (twilight, sunrise, etc) can be sold outright.
---
Lol this reminds me of people not wanting to command in Raid LFGs even tho there is literally no risk
---
I didn't like being forced to fill an event bar up to further my story.  But apart from that I thought it was fab.
---
So in the link posted here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh487baFzsbJARil-evNdrG3KOmoncEfurElBm0CzdE/edit#gid=1982020967) the best farm is a general node farm with something called volatile.  Can someone explain what this farm is to me?
---
I'm guessing it's these tools https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Volatile_Magic_Gathering_Tools 
---
but the wiki says they are currently unattainable. (Gem Store (unavailable) 	)
---
Which nodes are we supposed to farm?  Just run around cursed shore and other high level zones?
---
Are you playing ONLY to sell the GoE? If yes you are kinda dumb, I believe most people have at least one GoE dead inside their banks and you could just sell them without having anything prior, assuming you are PLAYING the game you should have some obsidians and spirit shards. But yeah, of course, they get gold out of it, if not they wouldn't buy it. 
---
**And they clearly said that YOU should make legendaries and sell them, and that is common sense that you can craft and sell legendaries for profit.** Why don't everybody does it for themselves? Because they don't have the gold needed to do it, be it the precursor or MC you will need gold to build your first legendary. 
---
This is not a scam, they get more gold than you because they are putting more gold in it than you. "Oh but I'm putting my time in it" so are they getting the gold and the materials for crafting the legendary. People play the game in different ways. Nobody is been tricked here. I also think this post a witch hunt? You could just inform everything without calling them scammers.
---
Ah. Nvm then!
---
Hey! Welcome to the game! Despite what this post may sound like it’s not doom and gloom! The game is great fun!
---
Unfortunately you can’t sell the gen 2 legendaries. They can only be crafted and are account bound on aquire
---
Same. These guys aren't special, they just treat this like a second job that doesn't pay. And like I always say, there is no better gold farm than farming your job and converting gems to gold. 2500 gold? What is that, 1-2 hours of overtime? Pfft
---
Guess then I should get the UM and/or VM, since they'll help with those ascended trinkets (which gold can't really buy)
---
You can do it, I only play wvw for 1 to 2 hours daily and 3-4 days a week since 5 year or so. Just one time fast forward story event on update nights or the following week to keep myself busy. I'm about to hit 29k just buy casually following the story and playing wvw. I used to play pvp and reached dragon and got some map achievements on here and there back then though. I can't be bothered by raid, collections, long farms and time consuming story achievements at all. One day...
---
I think you can type /wiki in chat box with a space and then shift click item in your hero panel to bring up the wiki page.

Although I appreciate that as it hir us yesterday the page might be incomplete,  but helps you for future thingies

I don't get it
---
I think its because it goes

Expansion (Named)

Living Story (Not Named)

Living Story (Named)
---
To me it seems like they are trying to pass off the new Living Story as an Expansion, or at least the list makes it look like that.
---
I'm not a huge fan.
---
I mean, I don't hate it, but it just seems a little over the top and really kinda contradictory. 
---
She's supposed to be restoring Tyria and undoing the Brand, but so far it just looks like she's replacing Kralk brand with her own kaleidoscope rainbow sparkles.
---
If that's all that's gonna happen, I'd think that a better solution would be to use whatever magic went into the "shatter the Brand Crystal" special action in the Thunderhead Peaks map, dredge heart.
---
Logical accuracy aside, it just looks kinda "early 90s preteen girl's trapper keeper" to me.
---
Certainly nothing so bad that it ruins the experience, but I'd have preferred either light blue crystal to match what she did to Caithe...or a different impact completely.
---
Same. I was really surprised by it. I’d take Metal Legion over deathmetal any day of the week.
---
I'm bummed it's way too easy, but I'm still pumped that we get an INSTANCED REPEATABLE THING for our story content. Keep them coming and make them more difficult and I'll be happy. Mini-dungeons that we won't call dungeons because we can't use that word anymore.
---
Exactly. The only thing this map is missing is a TP/bank.
---
I haven't watched the trailer either and I'm pretty sure a very small amount of the active playerbase actually did.
---
Personally I'd probably take good death metal, especially of the melodic type, over this. Still, I think this is very good. =)
---
The idea behind the node farm is going about the ls4 zones (sand swept isles, domain of istan etc) and farming the map specific resource nodes. You can consume items for volatile magic which you then trade out for cache’s at the map vender in domain of istan 
---
Use this site to work out which cache to buy:
---
http://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html
---
Wasnt this how the djinn in sandswept isles was released and then they changed it so no more point blank stacking? Not sure if thats correct
---
I could be totally wrong but that's all I could come up with. Maybe OP just dislikes the colours used who knows.
---
Well I fucked up, thought you had to do the unique ones that give you the keys to the Khan-Ur chest.
---

Small indie company
---
co-signed. Sick of seeing that war god now
---
Why would they care if new supply enters the "market"?
---
They control the market, first of all, as they're the only demand for this type of service.  Secondly, higher supply leads to lower costs which, in turn, leads to higher margins for the traders.  If that's an actual answer they gave, that's pretty odd.  Sure, it "fucks up" the farmers in their guild but, if the long-term farmers were smart (and this method as lucrative as posted), they'd graduate to trader anyway.  Higher supply in a luxury market whose value isn't predicated upon its scarcity is almost never a bad thing.
---
To be fair, I only listened up to ~35 minutes, had to bow out after I nearly choked to death laughing at the McDonald's analogy.  McDonald's is a real estate company as much as I'm a literal 7ft tall man-lion with horns.  The speaker has little idea of the relationship between franchiser and franchisee if that's what they think.
---
Thank you for this information. I felt very put off by it. Like it screamed: "Scammer"!! Good someone did more of a deeper dive into it.
---
Thank you for this
---
And then there's me. Unable to play after a medical procedure, at least for a few days, telling my surgeon his timing is terrible. Man, I hate not hanging with the guild on patch day.
---
Disclaimer, I haven’t watched the vid, so idk how they’re presenting it
---
But that being said, selling gifts of exploration has already been a thing. You mentioned gw2exchange, which is where I first learned about doing jt. Someone sends you all the non-account blind materials, you craft the legendary and send it back to them, they give you ~500g
---
As a gold farming method as I’m guessing they’re describing, it’s not efficient. If you instead however have tons of extra gifts, it becomes an extremely fast way to make gold for both you and the other guy. A lot of people just do map completion for fun. Make a new character, level then up by mapping, finish mapping, so some fashion wars, etc, which as you can imagine doesn’t net a lot of gold. But if you’ve done 3 map completions you have 6 gifts of exploration, and it could take you maybe 1-2 years of playing the game with some moderate gold farming to use all those up. Or, if you also have spirit shards to spare, you liquidate 2 of your gifts and now have 1000g to spend and craft your own legendary
---
Oh alright, cool! I’m somewhat f2p (only spent money to get a total makeover kit) but I plan on getting the expansions once I’m done with the map completion, whenever that may be. Thanks for the info!
---
I thought this was a perfect solution.
---
Or gold sellers
---
I did all story achievements and maps achievements, pretty much almost all PvE achievements and most collections (except black lion ones or legendary ones). The trick I use is to just do one or two each month, that way you I am not worrying much. You can save a night of WvsW for a collection.
---
Yes please.
---
At many points in this explanation as to why this is a "scam" the OP is making assumptions that are faulty at best.  
---
For instance, "they" are not telling you to sell "them" your spirit shards, in fact, you can make a quick experiment and see for yourself why that is just not what they're trying to do, but actually practically impossible to accomplish.  
---
If you go and try to sell your 5000+ spirit shards (just a number), you'll see that there's a limited demand for conversions, and that the way conversions work mandates that both persons share a guild and have some degree of trust because the buyer will be handing out mats, and not just that, conversion recipes are RNG based, so they are also trusting you to give them what you get over a certain amount of stacks of material they provide. If you followed me here you'll notice that is very hard for them to make a considerable portion of the playerbase "sell them their spirit shards".  
---
Of course we have to be skeptical, but they have stated where they gain with this, they don't want you selling them your spirit shards (there is more than enough people willing to do so already), they want you to USE your spirit shards instead of hoarding them not knowing how to convert them into gold.  
---
So consider this, why is the OP asking people to dismiss the obvious (crafting your own stuff is better than dumping raw mats on the TP), and ecourages them to do the opposite? Is the OP a good samaritan trying to convince people (with faulty information) that WP and this TP barons are scammers trying to take advantage of them? or is OP interested in people selling their raw mats, because maybe he is a big buyer that profits from that?  
---
I'm not accusing them of course, but I raise the question because you want to be skeptical, you need to be very critical about what is said, and OP's post doesn't hold water after that.
---
You have no fuckin idea about this game do you?
---
Coins did not spike due to that, they are used as currency because they spiked. Before that it was ecto used a lot as currency, did that keep the ecto prices spiked? Nope because they actually have easier ways to acquire. There goes your logic.
---
Gotta get those upvotes i guess. You are tricking people far more than any "tp baron" talk so far by spreading misinformation in a way that victimizes people which they love so they'll eat it up without questioning.
---
Gz.
---
Yes. But it is a system that unfairly rewards the already rich. The people who are able to take risks are more likely to be able to gain profit. For most workers taking that risk and failing would mean death and starvation. Therefore it is only worth it if you have enough capital already to not risk that.
---
That is why seizing the means of production is necessary. Instead of relying on entrepreneurs to take "risks" collective ownership of the ability to produce goods would allow for a far greater amount equality, as everyone benefits equally from that production. The privatization of the means of production leads to the owners making profit, not by their labour but due to the fact that they "own" them. 
---
Capitalism also only values people for their ability to labour. If you cannot do labour, you are worthless. Which i believe is inherently immoral aswell.
---
I think the wiki day and night timer has been updated if that helps
---
D: that's rough. Hope you feel better soon and have a smooth recovery!
---
If I never see any Rytlock/Crecia fanart I will be disappointed.
---
Not a scam, but statements like "(This price is SET, and will NEVER change in order to keep the market stable)" don't indicate it's fair, either.  This lets them make a tidy profit off the "set" price, and the "stability" just means they don't have to crunch numbers to identify what the fair market price actually is.
---
You say they're crunching numbers with their time, but there's a lot of shortcuts that indicate they're just selling past work over and over.
---
Everywhere, you dipshit

Ye I guess everyone has different preferences ;)

Not really. GW2 just doesn't have the good ones.
---
Charr are filterless and blunt. And since most of these are Blood, they don't really have any higher aspirations of the other legions to come in the way of their baser instincts. Also, lot of them were pumped up about the event.
---
This is not really an event item but rather a hidden item from the many inpatient inviduals who probably never will know the truth, i will leave this reply saying that what we obtained years ago is still obtainable today even if deleted.

Would be pretty nice if you could just choose it as they unlock, so fe. you could choose to use the HoT character screen if you preferred it.

Well, I was more on about your statement saying it is in "your other post" and the following "are you to lazy to scroll" which (imo) aimed at the long an detailed patch notes we were talking about and implies that we want long patch notes but are to lazy to scroll a damn Reddit thread.
---
But that is more or less bullshit, because patch notes are sorted , ordered and structured. Everything that a Reddit thread isn't.
---
 That's more or less what I wanted to point out.

&gt;It was doom and gloom people who expected Anet manned flight to Mars and then were disappointed
---
Are we STILL blaming the playerbase when ANet DID hype this up for months?
---
You see that's where you're wrong, it was Anet themselves who were hyping up the announcement. Making it much bigger then it actually was.
---
This is how real life works :(
---
Great idea! Esp since it’s a new story

"Mistaken identity"? I'm kinda hoping for a "Goldclaw is Gutslurper's pen name" comic for the same reason.

Gotta love games and stuff where its basically Steve Blum talking to Steve Blum

And just because I am not interested in a particular piece of the **game** does not mean it's content either.

Exactly but this "math" this poster did is SO off i can complete one in less then 2 days and i wouldnt be mindless farming either

next to that it was explained by others that as soon as you are gaining a small capital you will be able to lessen you time aswell

---
Axe = ass / sexy bits
---
That was my favorite exchange this release. It took me a second to get it, but then I burst out loud laughing.
---
Because of how the buffs work in this game, stacking will ALWAYS be what you're forced to do.
---
Unless they do it like WoW or FFXIV, where they're party wide as long as you're in the fight, stacking everyone will always be a thing.
---
so u saying that a shortcut to the end of the dry top JP isnt relevant ? that the fact we got this device but havent been able to figure out its exact purpose other than what we can use it for, sorry but i disagree on that, i find many of them quite relevant aswell as becoming anomaly quite relevant as it can trigger some npc's into other conversations . I get ya that it could be cheesed some to many of them with glider / mounts but then again i know that there is atleast 2 locations that cant which this device or other methods can aquire u access .
---
i believe and agree that the string id's found on the next versions of icons for the stabilizer can / might be legit but until released i wont put my fully beliefs intol it.
---
Brood Legion...
---
Now I await the Ass Legion to make an appearance.
---
What? "Many aren't really content, something you're actively playing"
---
Going after achievements, especially long collections, IS actively playing the game, working towards a goal. How is that NOT content?
---
Aha! Gotcha.
---
If the boss punished you for stacking? Like an AoE walloping that outlast what invulnerability a group of players generates
---
a leaderboard doesnt have to include every single person next to that i doubt it will include toxicity this is just for fun for those who can
---
Seems like a stretch other than the "after dark" bit.
---
There's so much dialogue in various places, even the charr cubs portray hostility.
---
One conversation I witnessed involved the charr cub distrustful of a sylvari trying to reassure them aurene isn't dangerous only to be cut short as a "liar!".
---
These little details are nice to find.
---
Rytlock dies. Steelchair takes up his flaming dragon sword. We kill Jormag on a very slippery and sharp iceberg.
---
This guy gets it
---
I think the whole thing with Balthazar and then what Kormir said took a heavy toll on her, as it should have.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/
---
Just in case you want it.
---
Better to make it Magdaer, would make more sense considering Rytlock already has Sohothin.
---
I agree what Anet talked about excited me so much and the prologue has got me giddy for the other the actual episodes. The problem people had with the presentation was how it was done.
---
This image stems from GW1 IIRC, I’m pretty sure this is a meme by the devs for the folks who recognize it.
---
This is basics of capitalism applied. I see no problems here sense their taking the risk of investment (getting scammed, having the capitol to begin with) and they have to go through the process of finding those people.
---
&gt; Nothing in raids incentivises going range. 
---
But like, no one ever said anything about range. Melee doesn't have to mean stacking on a boss...
---
It's not that hard to train yourself to be ambidextrous
---
Honestly i would prefer if i could switch the character screen between the available ones. Cause the OG screen is still my favorite
---
The "casual-friend raid introduction", in every other game, are the dungeons. Even NOW some people struggle with the dungeons because they require thoughts.
---
Instead of doing this stupid strike that feels easier than just fighting a Champion-level enemy, they should've focused on bringing back dungeons and use THEM as the stepping stone to raids.
---
But of course, if they did this, they wouldn't create a piss-easy enemy that the super-casuals can't beat over and over for those stupid shoulders that drop.
---
You probably know this, but you can click both left and right mouse buttons to walk forward. And if you get an MMO mouse, you can pretty much entirely play right your right hand.
---
Not really, no. Even if that was true, so what? Why not?  They are playing it safe since 2012. Recycling regions of the world already seen before. Even this saga will do the whole region already seen before 250 years ago in the lore.  
---
I would be happier if they took a risk and decided to take us somewhere where we never were in the entire franchise.
---
Found something close:
---
Shrine Guardian Outfit
---
Someone else responded with the same info. 
---
I didn't know the second step existed. I think I've been tossing him the stuff and interrupting the dialog where he adds that step by triggering the dialing telling me I fucked it up.
---
While I understand your point, there are inherent benefits to privatized production vs. public production. Particularly, because the company would be more competitive in a private environment and aim to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, increase quality/desirability of the product, and increase production to increase their profits. More production in an economy results in an increase in the standard of living for the individual as well as increased profits for businesses because of the availability of goods and the general cost going down due to increased supply.
---
 In the public production system, people are only responsible to pull their own weight but don't get rewarded (generally) from finding those increases to efficiencies, thus production doesn't increase as much and the overall system loses value to it's inefficiencies.  The standard of living stays lower and quality of life suffers due to it. 
---
Also, why is rewarding someone who takes a risk even tho they have money already a problem? Is there something wrong with profiting from a risk just because your life/livelyhood isn't on the line? Plus by doing that risk they enable other people to create value out of their time at little to no risk which is inherently good for the average worker. 
---
Also you're somewhat wrong about capitalism only valuing labor, not that I'm disagreeing with your overall point because I also agree that human beings have inherent value. We just talked about how Capitalism values risk, and by association Time is also a resource that can be leveraged to earn a profit. So for example a person that can't work but has 100k in the bank is worth about 4k/yr in the economy due to investment return rates at the moment (this also happens to be the principles for retired folks). Also "Labor" in terms of what someone can offer can be in a ton of different forms to the point that I don't think it's possible that someone has literally nothing they could leverage for value. Even something as small as your opinion on products in the market has a value or even a vlogger on YouTube can make some money from their experiences that they were already going to do anyways. The real trick is identifying how to make use of what you have to get value out of what you have to offer.
---
I didn't try them yet but I think the challenge bosses from dragon bash would be a good example. As they got harder, my group of 2 used to fracs and 3 less experienced started to struggle which taught the less experienced to be more careful. That's a good beginning imo and they can maybe add another level after this.
---
There are some new rewards that don't come from the map vendor, e.g. mini prismatic ooze.. if its not from the map vendor, it's probably a drop from the flame legion meta ;)
---
I feel like Ascalon proper in GW2 is just as lush as this map. They both have the Pre-searing aesthetic if you ignore the areas ravaged by the ghosts/flame legion/elder dragons.
---
Same for me.  He just instantly said "way to earn that promotion" or whatever.  Some of the dialogue started kind of stepping on itself as the game caught up, but the instance proceeded normally otherwise.
---
Meanwhile in DR RP
---
For God's sake, change the purple color of the Icebrood Saga of Story Journal panel. Make it ice blue
---
The purple color simply does not fit with Icebrood
---
Basically it's a subset of Flame Legion that wants to surrender/truce because they're tired of fighting and dying. I'm sure there's an extra sub-faction of Flame that doesn't agree, it was the same with the Ebonhawke Treaty and the Renegades.
---
I believe it's a skin for all weights that you get from a chest that allows you to choose which one you'd like.
---
Specifically Flame "Imperator" (even the in-game title has the quotes).
---
I have an mmo mouse, but it's a right handed one. Unfortuantely it'll be a couple of days before I can use it for keyboard/mouse stuff. It's fine though. I've caught up on a lot of Netflix.
---
I had a blast yesterday at the concert, huge smile on my face the whole time. I vaguely remember the in-game rock band in WoW, but Metal Legion blows them out of the water with both their music and having so much stuff to do during the concert itself!
---
Pretty sure that the personal story is almost never mentioned for ANYONE ever again.
---
Just to clarify what op said, this is about the commander kicking players out of the squad during the strike mission boss fight and therefore players getting forced out of the instance. This is not possible in raids.
---
It's pretty bad game design in my opinion...there should be some sort of in game clock / information available about when these events occur that doesn't require learning some sort of time conversion or searching through the wiki to locate information.  Similar to World boss timers (where although the gem store item helps - this should be available to everyone / not some hidden confusing information.)
---
How I wish to be as naive as you
---
Everyone knows a pyramid scheme (Multi-level marketing). Well, there you go. I fell for this back when i was 12, never again.
---
I would assume it's tied to the skin.
---
⑨, surely?
---
They asked for it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS1LmpiJFaM
---
Yep, yet GW2 players will just spout the "they were only retaking their 'homeland' Ascalon!!!!1111!1"
---
Read up on lore if you believe Ascalon is their homeland.
---
People stack on the boss because boons are applies in small aoe and melee dps is usually much stronger than pewpew. There's nothing to patch it's how the game works with its buff system. And this aint just about raids, any instanced content with a group works the same.
---
Pretty sure people will abandon the map as soon as Halloween hits. Maze farm may not be fun, but it's more profitable than concert meta.
---
Sword and Focus is a meta build for Guardian currently.  While Greatsword is the preferred primary weapon, Sword/Focus is the most damaging swap you can have for it, if you don't mind foregoing a ranged weapon set.  Since you want Sword to be your primary weapon, you can have Scepter/Shield as your swap to give you a ranged option.  Or even switch it up and go Sword/Shield and Scepter/Focus if you'd rather, though Focus is definitely the more damaging off-hand so if you do that you should be prepared to swap weapons relatively often to use the Focus skills.
---
Bear in mind that Sword is a Power-based weapon.  Your current Axe/Torch setup implies that you're a Condition Damage build, so you'll need to get new Berserker gear to make the best use of Sword and Scepter.  Or alternately, Diviner's gear will help you play Quickbrand in Fractals.
---
thank you..
---
It's not even close to raids, but while it incredibly easy, and i stood in one place the entire fight without healing once, I did like that I didn't have to post an lfg, and the public version should be added to all content.
---
its actually celestial in the picture, and yes you can since the material is for the logo and the shirt is the same
---
I watched someone get it yesterday
---
So true.
---
Banger did mention that l am a blood legion in the start of the prologue, I thought it was a nice hint to my character choice.
---
Could not get a part time job at min wage and maximize your gold that way l?
---
&gt; The thing is, if you don't learn it hard way, you're not learning anything in gw2.

*cough* fractals *cough*

"Skritt communicate mainly using a series of swift, near ultrasonic chirrups and chitters. While this sounds like a buzz to human ears, the skritt have exceptional hearing and so can communicate a great deal of information in a short period of time."
---
When they speak New Krytan to other races, they are actually speaking very slowly compared to how they communicate with other Skritt.
---
There is enough time in between each word that the can "query" nearby Skritt for more precise/advanced vocabulary.  Each Skritt might only know a handful of advanced words, but 20 Skritt together would have a pool of hundreds to pull from.
---
I don't really care if they don't do it, although it would be nice. However, I do admit that the impression that gives would matter way more than the change itself.
---
I think the idea of this boss is not to encourage people to meet any damage requirements...
---
when i solo'D the boss ydays is found out that around 16k is the damage you need to kill it within the enrage- what means if you go in with 10 ppl everyone just needs to do 1.6k dps
---
even tho the boss actually rewards you for being faster which is a nice thing to encourage people to get better dps wise...
---
But what i really think this boss is about is to tell people how to position and stack up for buffs and stuff... you get harder punished if you are ranged than if you are stacked underneat... also the boss kinda wants to show you to get an awareness for what is going on outside of your rotational loop... to jump a shockwave or to go to the button in 2.d phase to jump the big wave... 
---
they probably didn't want to make it any punsihing to not discouraeg people to do it ...
---
My personal opinion... it is nice to solo since you actually need to play decent to meet the damage requirement, but for 10 man they should have made it a bit harder:
---
like a knockback if the wave hits you... a bit more than just chill by the random aoes... a downstate even with prot and stuff if you miss the big wave in phase 2.
---
Then again this is the first version of this boss and from what i understood there will be some upgrade to it... so lets see what they give us
---
Eh.. no.
---
Definitely follow this advice. I've played Thief as my main over the past 6 years on GW2 and this is exactly what I would have recommended and how I got through PoF in the first few days it came out. I'd also recommend some precision/heal on crit food for extra sustain as well, like this:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scoop_of_Mintberry_Swirl_Ice_Cream
---
&gt; Yeah and nothing is concrete proof of encounters becoming more difficult
---
Dude, you should learn to read...
---
based on their revenue I say about 100k but whats active?  someone login for 10 sec in 3 months? its impossible to figure that out.
---
Bad bad T1 fracs!
---
Yea, Avo smoothies were a bit confusing that way. Plus Moa Wings are cheaper on the Map currency angle too. 2 peppers is less than one node, while 1 coconut milk is more than one node (on average).
---
Bring some arguments and you get your discussion. 
---
"It's shit" is no argument.
---
The landscape itself isn't very complex but the map is full of little details that make it feel alive, which I really appreciate.
---
Just some art of my Sylvari Warrior Berserker in some cold environments...Tried to mimic the GW2 style, but it's quite hard 8D

Characters can be threatening without having any physical powers. Him not being a good fighter is irrelevant to how much of a political threat he plays.
---
Thanks for the response. Would love to hear the details of what exactly was happening if you have time/you’re allowed to disclose it. 
---
Also, will there be compensation for the people that lost rank points and PvP matches due to this bug?
---
Honey, when I do you just fly away. You ain't worth it.
---
I don't care much about fanarts usually but I really dig this style.
---
Excellent execution, congrats!
---
I think the new map is insanely beautiful.... It's in my top favorites, actually.   Not every new map needs to be a multilayer maze. The core Tyria maps are my fav though, so....
---
It is very similar to the same area from GW1, which was pretty flat - especially by modern GW2 standards.
---
Yeah definitely there are more flowers. They also added some new trees and reused some
---
old models from Queensdale/Kessex (which always looked more like Pre than Plains of Ashford).
---
If you check out Blazeridge Steppes or Diessa Plateau, you'll notice some areas with the
---
similar aesthetic of greens and red iris flowers (not to the same extent of course).
---
Most likely past, as he didn't seem to recognize our character even if we've done the Rift events. He said something along the lines of "who are you and why are you bugging me?" to which we reply "Well you've always called me Cub, but..." And then he cuts us off with "Well then Cub, I'm busy, so leave me alone."
---
And yes, my character became "Cub" regardless of the fact that I'm playing as a Sylvari.
---
Before my static imploded two weeks ago we ran with whatever people wanted to bring. Start your own if you want that.
---
Hard disagree. I feel like the variety of themes and terrain crammed into a small space is almost a little much, but I love it that way.
---
He didn't have any ascended gear and didn't want to part with it
---
It looks like it did in GW1, which is kind of the point.
---
People consider anything a spoiler nowadays huh
---
&gt; Honey, when I do you just fly away.
---
So basically nothing but hot air, huh? ;)
---
They teach bad habits, just like open world does. I see it happen a ton when training nee people. Since people don't get punished, they have no need to actually deal with mechanics and don't know what most do.
---
My charr is Ash Legion and there are some small, brief little nods to it. Would be nice if we got a little pullback to some old characters.
---
Why put a spoiler tag if your title is a spoiler in itself?
---
High five on the 28k club. I just hit that last night after finishing the new jumping puzzle. I don't raid or pvp either, but did get some of season 1. I don't actively chase AP that often so that's probably why were about equal. Ir would be nice to finish off the Radiant armour, but that's going to take a while, so I'll live with finishing the Zenith skins for now.
---
Been playing for over 6.5 years and I’ve got less than 1 gold
---
have sex, virgin
---
44gold, accepting donations
---
Even when ANet explicitly promises difficulty they fail to deliver. Why should a between the line maybe promise of more difficulty in the literal easiest instanced content in the game be trusted?
---
Thanks for the art aswell from a big fan ;3
---
omg 😭
---
You also bring up very valid points. They did state all of this information in the video.
---
True. In a way, Elder dragons are more destructive than nuclear weapons, considering their corruption. Then there's the issue that killing them unbalances the world and may ruin it. You need to put a leash or harness onto them. And that's where I think Bangar will fail. He has no lead shielding, so to speak.
---
713 at hand, and around 700 in material storage, nothing crazy
---
Go farm Dragonfall, it's the best
---
Hi, I'm a new player and have a few questions.
---
1) I've read that Bags of loot give you level specific gear, is it worth to hoard them and open at lvl 80? I don't really have any shortage of items, the game showers you with loot quite generously as is.
---
2) Tome of Knowledge says it gives either a level or a spirit shard. Are spirit shards valuable? Or is it better to boost an alt with tomes.
---
still nice
---
In story instance at least you can totally pew pew from the side as longbow range is greater than all attacks and snowballs trajectory :)
---
"Only 800 gems!"
---
Should add a caveat for recent purchases.
---
I have 110g, which is on the higher end for me, usually once I get this high I start spending on chunks of legendaries I've yet to finish, or convert to gems.
---
Bad at saving.
---
Well, maybe. But not in this particular dialouge.
---
decent amount
---
Coward!
---
I would gladly accept this as canon.
---
What?
---
Well, ANet did say they would have more of a focus on expanding existing maps vs a new map every episode. So adding hearts is one way to do that.
---
If they did that, even the fights can be designed better, but after 7 years, it's clear they'll never do it and they actively want people to stack \[which is a visual nightmare to the shiny monstrosities that we can equip now\].
---
t1 is 1 to 3 people(even t4 isn't all that bad with 4) so if you bring 6 people then it makes sense it would be trivial
---
It is the same here. Just for every single item the vendor offers seperately. If you speak to him right after entering the map, he will offer next to nothing.
---
Embrace the Noise!
---
you're looking at it.
---
The dialogue is slightly different, and it also recognizes which Legion you are part of. Additionally, there's a hidden 0 AP achievement for speaking with your Legion's Imperator during the story.
---
Today I helped a player who already played for 1 year and was playing through season 4. 
---
Said player didn't know his armor stats and never looked at them.
---
He also didn't know what traits are and how to use them for your build.
---
With the response: "I don't like building."
---
There are different types of difficulty in gw2 so that everybody can enjoy the game.
---
I still haven't touched raids yet for that reason.
---
I like the hearts
---
there are 8 symbols
---
I wouldn't mind if we went back to the original launcher theme and character screen.
---
I've sold about 8 gift of masteries so far for 500g a pop. But in my case, I've had 10 gift of explorations and gift of battles sitting on my bank for years, clogging my bank slots. I did not get them to sell, I just did it cause it was fun exploring back then. I have about 20 million Karma accumulated over time, and it keeps going up. When the spirit shard was introduced, I instantly got around 11k spirit shard, I have about 16k now even after selling 8 gift of masteries. I have so much dungeon tokens from doing the dungeons way back when they were the only source of gold. I knew that I would make more if I were to craft the legendaries myself, but I've been using my T6s for my own legendaries, so far I've made Eternity, The Predator, Astralaria, Nevermore, Aurora, Ad Infi, Exordium, Vision, Shining Blade, and a full set of Legendary Armor. I'm working on Coalescence and Pharus atm. Still deciding if I want Incinerator or not, I can make it right now if I want to, but still deciding. 
---
For some people like myself, with stockpile of stuff, selling GoM makes sense. It's the fastest way to boost your gold. Selling legendaries has their downside as well, mostly the time it takes to sell them. 
---
While I agree with you that people shouldn't get out of their way just to get GoM to sell.
---
166g 32s 41c
---
This is more than I normally have. Gearing alts is expensive.
---
no. There is an actual product that is being sold for profit to consumers outside the chain. its just a standard tiered production method.
---
Most of the people I trained in T1 had more trouble relearning stuff than getting straight into hard content. But you're the one ignoring everything. It seems ANet wants to do stuff the dumb way anyway, so no point in even having this discussion. People are going to get used to this and complain any difficulty above this is too hard anyway, the game has been dumbed down so many times already.
---
815
---
Yeah that purple highlight should also change if they want to indicate this being a new story (and when we're on it, can we make season 2 green since its way more relevant for hot than it is for core)
---
It was a mistake on my side. I checked all emails, but haven't received any, so I refiled it and it all looks good now.
---
104. No idea how since I’m constantly out of g lmao.
---
are people grinding gifts of mastery just to sell them?  I always assumed people just slowly collected the stuff to make one by playing the game normally, then realized they can sell the account-bound stuff for some extra gold.  
---
like putting an ad on your car; you're not driving around because the ad gets you money, you're driving to your day job and the ad is just a little extra.
---
Most easy raid bosses don’t have wipe mechanics if you are in the wrong spot mechanics anyway. Like VG, gorseval, soulless horror, MO etc. you can be wherever you want as long as you aren’t the tank.
---
Hell yeah a Scotsman playing a Charr. Makes a difference to a Scotsman playing Dwarves. (Although he played Dwalin in the Hobbit movies).
---
I think there is an error here as the 15% from the tp tax is not profit
---
Profit is what is made after liabilities are paid, or whatever is over the break even point.
---
So that 125g is not actually 125g, it should be the cost of (player + supplies) - CoS gold = profit
---
And basically the player is making something like 28g an hour, i'll say abouts (?), i'm not including sometime like dungeon, and WC which doesn't make you much gold
---
And that's why my main has Frostfang in his inventory. Just in case. 
---
Shame he's not a Norn. I should pass Frostfang over to my Norn Warrior.
---
OP probably listens to bs music like Drake and Post Malone, cause even though the lyrics are a bit cringy, a real metalhead should be able to appreciate the effort regardless ;P \m/
---
A party member posted it after finishing the strike mission boss a few minutes ago. Have bought it already so I can't confirm it myself but it seems to be the case.
---
The second point, at least, runs into a problem: It's not at all obvious that the value of legendary weapons isn't predicated on their scarcity. At least for high-impact price changes, high-demand legendaries (I looked at bolt, incinerator, and twilight) seem to track their inputs in price. Paradigm example would be the spike in ectoplasm prices in Summer 2016. This corresponded to a price spike in the aforementioned legendaries (though not so much in low-demand legendaries such as colossus). If we take these folks at their word that a large portion of their assets are in relatively liquid legendaries (purely an "if" statement, I take no stand on whether we should), then the effect of a *massive* influx of t6 supply (presumably their goal if they're going on WP's channel) might hurt their net wealth more than it helps,  especially since it would lower market demand for legendaries at the same time by making them easier to craft.
---
That's not to say that they don't stand to gain here, but any gain will be more complicated than "lower costs equals higher profits." There's at least a plausible story to be told that's not strictly predatory along the lines of: Currently most players have incredibly low liquidity, and substantially increasing the typical player's liquidity will both cause individual players to, on net, enter luxury markets on the demand side, and cause increased interest in the game overall since desirable goals will seem more attainable, which benefits everyone (and also increases demand for luxury goods).
---
Yeah I know the whole point was like they will pay you for spirit shards but I was just curious about doing my own conversions. Interestingly the most profitable ones seem to be converting greenwood planks and small scales. Thanks for the info.
---
Shouldn't you be submitting this to the wine/wine-nine teams as Linux isn't an officially supported OS by Arenanet. Or did I miss an announcement by Arenanet?
---
Around 8k
---
No, I mean you're missing the point if you're selling mats.
---
You want us to be screenshot? There are roofs and stables and u can even pull the from outside the walls. and we are all telling u the same thing. You are just trolling or are simply not good enough. Chose yourself.
---
&gt;Thing is, that the second phase takes away mechanics from the first phase and adds one new thing that is supposed to wipe you.
---
That's why the snowman raid from wintersday is better at teaching raids.  Sure it's easy, but the mechanics build on eachother throughout the encounter.  This is why, in my view, this strike mission fails to do its job at teaching anything.
---
I've never found these conversion to be particularly good.  
---
if it gives 1+g/SS, it always takes like 2-5 minutes per SS = 12-30g/hour (including time to place buy orders, throw stuff in forge, and sell items)  
---
if it uses 50 SS in a couple minutes, it always gives like 12s / SS  
---
there's nothing that gives high g / SS quickly
---
and which T5 -&gt; T6? none of them are even profitable enough to make the list right now.  T2 -&gt; T3 is highest at 61s/SS.
---
Quick side-note about legendaries, even if you aren't planning on making one right now, there are time-expensive things you can be saving up as you go along. Both generations require Clovers, which you can get for free from your monthly login loyalty chest. The Gift of Battle can be tedious, but checking your daily quest for "WvW Big spender" and buying a cheap skin to get the potion can help. Mystic coins take a while but you get one extra per day by killing the ley-line anomaly 20 minutes after daily reset.
---
Gen 1's need quite a bit of daily crafting cooldowns like mithrillium, while gen 2's need a truly sickening amount of mithril and elder wood logs.
---
Special notes about gen2 parts:
---
Mystic Curios can be made by any weapon-crafting profession. They're not account-bound and very efficiently store a lot of bulk crafting materials like mithril, blood, venom sacks, etc. You'll need a bunch and they can be sold off on the TP later if you change your mind, I recommend investing in the recipe before you start selling off stacks of mithril for pocket change.
---
It's cheaper to make 400 Offhand shards (shards of friendship) and convert those to 290 2-hand shards than it is to craft the 290 2H shards to begin with.
---
You'll need lots of Amalgamated Gemstones, so do those metas and stockpile regular crafting materials while you're at it.
---
It's cheaper to buy clovers from the fractal vendor (2 per day) than it is to gamble for them.
---
They had far less achievements, so the points were more concentrated. Except S1 though, S1 was bonkers with AP.
---
Now answer me this.
---
Why?
---
Keyword being arguably, since it’s not even close in my opinion.
---
Completely agree. GW2 dialogue has been really well cone of the games that I play. STO, my other MMO, is hilariously bad and audio timing outside of cutscenes but they also use a dialogue system where you have to hit next to load the next audio so someone will get interrupted but until you hit next they just sit there lol. But hey it's a almost 10 year old game on an even older engine and launched with no voice over at all so the state it's in now is pretty good considering.
---
To each their own. Not everyone is going to like the same stuff all the time, life would be boring if they did.
---
I enjoyed it because its something new and different, as time goes on I'm sure people will move on to other things as they always do.
---
Credit where credit is due, that event is fucking amazing.
---
Thanks for the overview, I had no idea any of this was going on. It sounds like a lot of his contributions were volunteer work, what a shame we've lost him. I think I'll stop by the event. :}
---
I see the outline and the ideas.  They look sound.  What do you do to get "started" as a casual player who might put an hour or 2 in a day.  I'm half way through making Dusk.  I want to get through some of the other legendary's, but grinding iron ore and farming nodes gets boring.  I would rather convert what I have and make money so I don't have to worry about money.  Is basically making your first legendary required, or do you need to basically go through your bullet points above to get started?  Once you have those things who do you talk too or where do you go?  Maybe I'm coming into this late?
---
What would you consider better?
---
Most metal music representation in games is cringey. This metal band in gw2 is far from worst Ive seen, still not the best.
---
&gt;  thieves guild
---
that sounds like you have greatly increased chance of aggroing everything by having one of them end up in the rage of one of the mobs' aggro radius since you have no control over them
---
one thing about this mission is that as soon as I got through the gates it reminded me of a GW1 mission so I just played through it like a GW1 mission instead
---
Is there a source for that or are you just assuming stuff?
---
Me too... was an insta buy from the vendor for me and than a guy got the node in the strike mission a few minutes after. At least it teached me to look up the tp first from now on.
---
Because this is a repeated response, I made an edit to the first post.
---
Seriously. I'm not really a big fan of it but it's not grating it's just more... Taxing? The first time is really novel, but doing it 11 more times for the keys alone is already making it less interesting.
---
... And the 500 crazed fans for Professional Bouncer is ridiculous imo.
---
It's an option but also totally unnecessary.
---
I mean the whole thing is bullshit but its so funny I'm not going to argue with it.
---
Sticking to similar ones here:
---
In terms of combat and instanced content: WoW
---
In terms of graphics and engine: GW2
---
In terms of story: Subjective. Though I did like the presentation and focus of SWTOR, not discussing writing.
---
In terms of open world content: GW2
---
In terms of PvP: WoW
---
In terms of endgame content besides raiding: GW2
---
It's a bit too bright
---
no, GWEN. Almost literally where you find Gwen (technically Dalada Uplands)
---
That... that  needs to be a mini, dammit! :D
---
Nice, worst design ever made. Lets spend 10 more gold and magic to get it fast from the merchant.
---
there is an achievement for it
---
God damn it, furries!
---
Probably like the sun?
---
There's healing support builds that make good use of mace/shield and staff, but they're painful to kill anything solo with. Also staff is a healing weapon so your damage coefficients are awful... but the heals are nice. It's perfectly viable to play support in open world meta-events, just be aware you're going to slow to a crawl if you do anything on your own with that setup.
---
I'm already in a guild that runs whatever is available. *I* have this, the problem is that this sort of mentaility is hurting the raid community as a whole and by extension me, because the less people raid, because of a wrong perception about the content, the less ressources are spent on it.
---
There'd be a lot more people willing to try out the content if they could play their "tank Ele", or their "heal warrior". These builds aren't optimal, but they can easily work in raids and the perception that they can't is turning away people.
---
Can you do anything with it in that situation? If not having a 60g drop turn into trash is pretty awful design. :/
---
Could be like a charr version of the gay hanky code.
---
I play a lot of both games, and I can say with some certainty that PoE has a lot more flipping going on than you indicate (in particular in the currency markets). The other thing worth noting is that the relative health of the PoE market has very little to do with market freedom. The ability for the market to be both free and healthy arises from the fact that crafting nearly-best-in-slot gear is an enormous currency sink. So rather than a 15% tax on everything, you have something closer to a 90% average tax on luxury items.
---
I think you can get it from daily Strike as well? Not sure though but yeah daily meta chest in vault, map completion and possibly daily JP.
---
Aaaand now the re-installation is stalling while downloading
---
But it’s true lol. The game is only alive bc people buy this stuff :)
---
I might be Iron Legion, but I'm pretty sure I want to just marry Malice. She's so darn wonderful.
---
Also, as Iron Legion, I'm so glad we got specific moments with Smodur? Man, this whole thing has been so good.
---
I am pretty sure this box is same from Ember Bay.
---
Fair enough. I wasn’t personally affected by rank loss, but as someone who used to regularly play during season, I know how frustrating it would be to lose rank like that. Hopefully support can actually take care of these people. I remember once when I had left over an hour of reward chests from farming Istan pile up by not clicking on them immediately, and they suddenly all disappeared. Support essentially told me that it was tough luck and that they couldn’t compensate me with anything at all. I’ve been playing this game for over 6.5 years and followed ever since it was announced, and I had never had reward chests disappear. Was very disappointed in their response. 
---
On a more positive note: I really appreciate you having a conversation with someone like me (and thus the community at large). Seeing more detailed descriptions of what goes on behind the scenes is helpful. Although it sounds like this particular bug was hard (might have even been impossible by the sound of it) to catch in testing, things like LFG pictures showing “under construction” place holders and having countless typos throughout story content is not a good look for the game. I know a lot of players, particularly veterans, aren’t exactly ecstatic about the game’s current state and things like that, small as they may seem, add up. Hell, I even applied for a job as a writer at ANET for GW2 simply because I love the game so much and would really like to contribute to cleaning up grammar and spelling along with future writing in general. Unfortunately, I think my lack of a degree in that field and limited experience (just now coming up on two years as an independent contractor working as a senior editor and writer for a small media company) meant I wasn’t a good fit for the team.
---
I don't mean to be "that guy," but honestly, it irks me how easily flip-floppy and dramatic the people of this reddit are. I'm happy people are enjoying the release, but for the praise to come so suddenly after overreacting to a stream just seems shallow.
---
You probably aren't used to abusing full counter or some have enough crit chance.
---
Spellbreaker is extremely crit-oriented, but it definitely far far better than Berserker since it's the tanky spec with cleanse and resistance and Berserker is the high-risk high-reward squishy spec with only damage. Berserker needs support in order to function properly.
---
Core Warrior is probably better than both of them when it comes to solo play. Either Core or Spellbreaker are the way to go for solo.
---
&gt; Chronos aren't *needed*, Druids aren't *needed*. They are optimal, sure, but *optimal isn't needed* 
---
I get it, you're a big boi who doesn't need no meta. 
---
Some of us actally practice their characters, rotations, tanking, stuff, before they join the party. Then join a group, after gathering the needed KP. Then realize half their group is made of braindead people who got carried through 250 Escorts and never learned how to play.
---
Chronos and druids aren't needed in pugs because you have to have them for the kill to work, they are just the safest way to give the 2 dps players that actually know their stuff enough buffs, protection and shit to carry the 4 other clueless randos through the encounter.
---
This is now my favorite moment in all of DC history.
---
&gt;Braham Eirsson: Ooh! Now that's a challenge for a couple charr.
---
Rytlock Brimstone: Maybe even a bit too much.
---
Crecia Stoneglow: You're right. But we can't upend the ceremony. We need—
---
Crecia Stoneglow: The harpoons. We'll tie the creature down and let Ryland finish the job.
---
Rytlock Brimstone: On it.
---
Crecia Stoneglow: *Assist only, Rytlock.*

You should follow directions better.
---
Interesting theory...and if that's indeed what they're doing, I think it's a wise move.

&gt;[&amp;AgFbAAAA] 	Prologue: Bound by Blood
---
whoa spoilers
---
Guild halls are instances without a dedicated owner ... so it is intended that the glyph is not working. Who knows why they have decided that this is the best approach of a solution ... most likely because it is the easiest workaround.
---
&gt; and Post Malone, cause even though the lyrics are a bit cringy, a real metalhead should be able to appreciate the effort regar
---
My eyes are bleeding.   
---
Maybe he prefers a content where he can actually fight over a content that resembles heart quests tasks ''water the plants''. I share his opinion as well and I listen anything from 40's music to Iron Maiden, 2pac and Rolling Stones. How a person feels about an event doesn't say jack shit about the type of music he listens to.
---
They said Episode 1 will have a wildly different tone than the prologue. So I'd expect the innuendos to turn into violence and horror pretty quickly.
---
Mostly it was at least 100 but after looking at my material storage and also selling minis/weapon skins I will never use, I sit at around 400~
---
Everyone makes mistakes.
---
Instead me, of course. When it *seems* I made a mistake, it's a glitch in The Matrix.
---
&gt; Make legendaries cost 10k dungeon tokens
---
&gt;or it is so absurdly out of reach I would need to do soul-crushing farms for ages
---
lol
---
Honestly the meta events feel just like heart quests.
---
Oh, so that person selling a get rich scheme wasn't legit. Oh my! But it's really nice to break it all down. Many players do not know about the value of various activities and farms. The worst off are those that know a bit and don't know a bit, because these are more prone to fall to prey to schemes like this.
---
All and all, the only big thing in the video is forming internal trade with friends you trust to bypass TP fees, though many of us probably do this even without thinking-- we certainly didn't to watch 2 hours about that when you probably could have spent the time to watch a guide on actually playing better. In the end, when playing a game like this, nothing is more valuable than your time. We don't get younger unfortunately-- don't sacrifice it for some virtual coin.
---
Also I guess don't buy legendaries on the TP, now that we know where it's coming from.
---
They have low amounts because there are so many of them and they all have many tiers.
---
Tooth of Jormag? The precursor is Tooth of Frostfang. There is the sword Jormag's Breath but based on what we know of the lore that sort of action would make more sense for Kralkatorrik
---
Well, not in regards to the game. It is the same with guild banks why they will not be restored if your account gets hacked. Even if you are the only player in the guild.
---
While the writing is solid and the lore building is amazing. I can't help it but to feel this is like the White Mantle 2.0.
---
Don't get me wrong, this prologue was amazingly handled and I'm a lot more engaged compared to the time White Mantle attacked. The sudden change in tone of the story, and how the ambient dialogue becoming more and more hostile (even towards a blood legion charr commander) was actually unsettling.
---
Still, I really feel like I'm just seeing the same story reskinned over and over, albeit a lot more polished this time. A traditional, White-Old-Male^(TM) xenophobic leader, planted a rebel faction that was secretly a dud set up by the said leader, had spies throughout all highly influential sub-factions, spread inflammatory propaganda...  I really wish I could forget about Living World Season 3 so I can at least feel somehow surprised by the turn of the story. It really is a lot more refined and the characters are more complex and likable, yet the premise is just too damn similar. 
---
That's just one thing I really can't get over GW2. Sons of Svanir, White Mantle, and about 3/4 of the minor villainous factions in the game are built from the same mold; religious and zealous nutjobs that are sexist/racist/xenophobic. I'm not saying this trope makes for poor villain but it has been done to a point where I can't bring myself to take them seriously anymore. "Here we go again."
---
Ash legion does it from behind ;)
---
About 2400 gold. Got quite a bit wrapped up in investments, TP listings etc. Going to go blow a good chunk of that into finishing Nevermore.
---
Awesome
---
But PoF and HoT are the same purchase now. 
---
The only people who own an expansion and don't have PoF are people who bought HoT 3 years ago and haven't bought PoF.
---
Surely if they're the same purchase, it isn't necessarily PoF themed anymore and they can move away from the current desert theme and give us something new?
---
Almost every event has one.
---
I very much prefer having 10 achievements with 1 AP each than 1 with 10. It gets you to see more of the content.
---
hes so sexy
---
Sam is a treasure but yeah he's getting pretty recognizable.
---
They need to let him do his Nott voice for a change.
---
Thanks m8
---
Do you go berserk in the sack?
---
While I can see that point, Hanakocz makes the big aspect of it. GW1 mapped out almost 100% of the Tyria landscape. Most while there are new areas, some of it would entail going through land we've already visited, or leaving gaps in the map. Revisiting locations is a bad thing if nothing changes at all, but if there are changes, what's the issue?
---
Another aspect is, story telling. It makes sense to visit the blood legion homelands/far shiverpeaks again due to story aspects. Just suddenly wandering off to the Island of Janthir may be a tougher sell. Why would we go to brand new far regions when we still have very real, local (to the world map area at least) threats? Jormag has been sitting in the far shiverpeaks, why is it a bad thing that we are going back there to deal with Jormag?
---
Agreed
---
&gt; making legendaries that much harder to get for the average player
---
That is a misconception because even if they are buying up large amounts of mystic coins, they dont affect the rate every account is able to earn their own mystic coins to build a legendary.
---
Sure, if you are looking at buying extra mystic coins from other players, the price to forge your own legendary will rise with the price of mystic coins. But you are still able to buy those mystic coins at the same price as those guys at any given time.
---
And there are way more players that dont have any personal demand for mystic coins because they dont want to make legendary gear than there are players that are actively working towards legendary gear. So the majority of regular players profits form higher MC prices because they sell them instead of buying them.
---
Also, if you check the price graphs for mystic coins and legendary weapons over the last year you will see that mystic coins have been pretty stable in the 8 months before mid may at 1.25g and then rose pretty quickly in value up to around 1.5g, which is their current value as well. However, legendary weapons saw a small price spike in the 2 months before may (about 10%) and then lost 10% value again while MYstic Coins went up 20%.
---
So there isnt really any evidence that the higher MC prices also raised the value of getting legendary weapons like you claim.
---
And the price spike was most likely triggered by the release of Vision during war eternal and not because some people started using it as exchange currency (which was common practice at the exchange anyways long before that).
---
I've had the same problem and disabling d912pxy helped.
---
Except it is supposedly tuned for 10, and suggested that it is an intro to raids.
---
And same problem. Most people **didn't** learn and do homework if they could avoid it back when I was in school, and we didn't even have Google. Just because something is beneficial, or rational, very often isn't enough of a reason for people to make actual effort.
---
Some time ago I had a similar problem, I couldn't figure what caused it, i tried to remove add ons, turn off chrome to let gw2 use more ram since the whole pc lagged. At the end I realized it wasn't any of those but rather lack of space on my ssd (place where i had both windows and the game). After a long time of cleaning it up to get as much space as possible without making any major changes and getting it back to 35 out of 120gb the game started running smooth, the stutters stopped, textures loaded almost instantly, so if nothing from other comments will work, you can give that a try, assuming ofc you have disk space problems. Might be other issues like a dying disk but that worked for me to fix it so maybe it will help you or someone else.
---
I forgot how far I got, but was always among the top 3 in my guild. I don't think I use a single thing ive gotten from the points themselves, maybe the hellfire pieces once in a while.
---
When I realized that, the AP grind kind of lost its purpose for me, especially with how time intensive it gets, and for rewards I wont use (maybe would have used some more when the game was fresh...)
---
Out of personal interest, what's the best subscription MMO to you?
---
Do you have d912pxy installed? Had the same issue and removed it. Now everything works fine. Need to wait for an updated version.
---
Not nough.
---
[MORE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg/330px-Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg).
---
This helped yeah. Hopefully [megai2](/u/megai2) can update the mod.
---
Have you tried to up the character model limit? It shouldn't change anything in regards to the environment but I have seen strange things with these (invisible enemies as long as they are not targeted on low settings for example). I am playing on highest settings and while there is popping here and there it is far less noticable for me.
---
And with [Bill comes Ted](https://youtu.be/izrzkS5xxuc).
---
Agreed, about difficulty. But it’s not... it’s far easier. Seems at the level of the easiest of bounties.
---
Well burn me, it's a stingray.
---
The point of my comment wasn't that he had an army, though I can see why you'd think that, it was that his army and our army pull from the same pool. We can't cross swords with him because he's not attacking us directly, he's fighting with rhetoric and fearmongering.
---
By the Joko way, I assume you mean declaring himself and his people separate and against the Commander? If so, then no, him doing that isn't threatening. More threatening (and what I though he'd do) is to spread rumors and dissent about how we can't be trusted, how Rytlock is nothing more than an insubordinate Tribune (perhaps he'll be declared Gladium soon, the rumors say), how Aurene is an unaimed weapon (similar to the opposition group in Jahai, but this time with actual political power), things like that. Discredit us to the point we go into the next fight we inevitably have with no Charr allies, and many Charr enemies.

All this chatter, and no one mentioned the real reason.  A long time ago, anet used to give really detailed patch notes.  But a lot of people said they wanted to discover things organically, and anet, being lazy, said "less work for us!"  and now we get shitty pve patch notes.
---
I think I’m at about 55ish? I usually stay in that range, I’m very much a casual player

This is something that will happen in every game with any form of trading.

Couldn't have. No one on reddit made a thread about the Table's exit announcement yet.

I have other media that you can easily find in the links above.
---
Dammit. I want that guardian video! To hell with spam! ;)
---
They did that, check the vendor that sells flags and decorations
---
Yea, but that not taking in the mat cost.
---
According to the wiki bolts "mat cost" would equal around 1030g 25s 58c, which after that is cover plus the 500g to the player cost your talking about ~1530g, so if the buy price is 2499, they take home about ~1000g that is assuming this is not sold on the tp, in that case they are avoiding the tp tax and 125g is not spent, and we would add the 125g into bolt, meaning bolt's true cost is 1155g and not the 1030g, really is aboit avoiding the tp tax which is something is do everyday in rl
---
If you check the logs when you crash, it's a texture loading and null reward track issue. There are 2 null reward tracks and the textures are loading as "wrong size" or cannot be found.
---
New recipe, Hatched green chili cheeseburgers.

No, it’s the same OP who posted the link. He went to. Bunch of gaming threads and asked what their favorite mmo was and made a video out of it. There were not that many replies by the looks of it, only one guy commented GW2. He also reposted this vid to all the other game subs he mentions.
---
Probably you're gonna need two hands
---
I can't answer that, as I did not play any subscription MMOs. I did free 14 day trial of EVE in like 2007 and I enjoyed it, but that's about it.
---
It depends on the achievements.
---
For instance, find 30 tokens on this map. That's nice, that's a goal. But I wouldn't really consider that "content", as there is no gameplay. Same with many exploration achievements. They are nice to have, but hardly content per se.
---
Whereas a legendary weapon sends you doing events, dungeons, fractals, crafting ...
---
Just as a heads up, crafting is more for personal gain than making any money. You can use [GW2crafts](http://gw2crafts.net) to help optimize leveling crafting but mainly you're unlocking ascended crafting for yourself for later and crafting gear you're missing (but usually it's cheaper to just buy parts on the TP, check [gw2Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator).
---
Little more than 1500 at the moment.
---
Bangar by the sheer presentation of him and voice acting became one of my top 5 gw2 characters within this one episode, he did such an amazing job voicing him
---
Yeah, that's very odd. I think perhaps they found that new players were selling their bags to vendors and replaced it with an account-bound one.
---
Its from the Vault and map completion, and it hasnt beed added to the whitelist yet, so it hasnt dropped yet.

I am friendly with the people involved in the making of this video and the hate for it is so absurd. The entire point of the spirit shard conversions and selling Gifts of Mastery is to make some gold for relatively quick and easy profit. You can then use that profit to do whatever you want; buy shinies for yourself, OR, use that money to make even more money. With effort, any player can become the bigger fish. 
---
People are so offended and feel as though they’re being “exploited.” For what? Someone else might be making more gold but you’re still making good gold, too.

There's not a single second in which there isn't an event up, and many refresh pretty fast, in about 5-15 minutes.
---
You know, I think it would be neat if we got a 'center' map for a few others over the season. Next ep we head southwest, connect directly to this one. Expand that in Ep 2. Ep 3 adds a tiny area in the north of the prologue map, which connects to a new map for Ep 3 and 4. Same thing for 5 and 6 in another direction, and by the end we've gotten the new maps, and the original map has about 30-40% more than it did at launch.
---
Oh, I remember watching this a while back. Also it's called bloodbound, what a coincidence.
---
If you mean a portal scroll, it's available from the Rally Provisioner merchant near the Blood Keep waypoint. You have to complete the story chapter 'A Race to Arms' to unlock it.
---
It has been 3-4 months, but they are trying to reduce the wait by having 3 teams instead 2 working on them.
---
*Trying* being the operative word.
---
Last 2 episodes have been 4.5 months.
---
* ep5 -&gt; 08-01-19 (15 week since previous)
---
* ep6 -&gt; 14-05-19 (18 week)
---
* Prologue -&gt; 17-09-19 (18 week)
---
because it is the first strike mission it NEEDED to be unfailable, and free. So EVERYONE who will try it will kill it, and because of this they will try the other ones, even if they will be harder. So if you think about it the first one needed to be like that if people who are afraid of raids will get interested in this content.
---
Ah ok, thanks for the clarification. Had the map + Drakkar combined in my head's release schedule.
---
I think you are misunderstanding something here:
---
Voice of Metal is the name of the new Warhorn Skin and it also doesnt alter the voice of the character in any way, the warhorn just has different sound effects than regular warhorns. 
---
Wether you are wearing a helmet or not has absolutely no impact on your characters voice or the sound of your warhorn when you blast it.
---
Fitting but highly unfair for those that do not own or will not invest in making a precursor or legendary weapon.
---
Ye, depending which Legion you choose at the beginning has unique dialogue, especially with your Imperator. Smodur is also badass.
---
There's one so far to the west that the server may not register the hit, so you don't get the autotracking for the bullet and all bullets stray from it.
---
thank you
---
LET US CHOOSE IT OR SELL DIFFERENT ONES ON GEMSTORE TAKE MY MONEY
---
They always had 3 teams on living world. They still do but they also have a 4th team working on something unannounced.
---
ngl, ffxiv updates for 3months is triple gw2 patches.
---
Next update we get continue of story,  Nier alliance raid, ultimate trial or raid (forgot which) and some extra stuff. Meanwhile gw2 is just some story and that's basically it and 1raid every 3 big patches and 1 fractal every 3 big patches.
---
Really hard to compare release schedules when one game releases way more.
---
I doubt the Charr following Bangar will remain "fully" Charr for a long time. The trailer for S5 did show us Icebrood Charr.  
---
What I expect though is the classical "I have been corrupted by the Big Evil but I have retained part of my conscience because of my importance to the plot and some hero character and I will have some change of heart at the last moment and asked to be killed and freed from my servitude" from either Bangar or Ryland. Bonus point if Rytlock kills them and is looking away at the end of the finishing blow, and then moves on without showing any emotions beside a feeling of waste.
---
Not enough
---
I'm waiting to pass judgement on this until there are more strike missions in the game. Let's not assume that all strike missions will be created equal, there may well be an escalation/progression of strike missions slowly becoming more difficult and adding more elements over time. I don't think the intention is to go immediately from the first strike mission introduced in the game to being raid ready.
---
68g and still working on getting my griffon mount. I'll need another 132g yet for that.
---
Or maybe the Table is on the TABLE....
---
We have little "cogs" for our option button, 100% modern, so you don't really have a leg to stand on regarding theme of the game.
---
Modern design doesn't mean modern packaging. It can still use parchment/painterly aesthetic. That doesn't mean the ease of navigation and intuitiveness of features needs to be archaic.

---
I try not to drop below 3k. Sitting at 3.5k right now. But I don’t play regularly atm so it won’t change anytime soon.
---
There are actually 2 versions of it, the one from the vendor for 250 chilis and 2k VM is account bound but there also is a tradeable version which you can buy on the tp.
---
Its unclear yet where the unbound versions comes from but my guess would be a very rare drop from the chests you find across the map or from event metas.

You are doing the tedious bit, and they make a huge profit and do very little.

You were right the first time, but wrong in your interpretation.

Modern rework doesn't mean changing the aesthetic. It's about ease of function, like getting to drag-and-drop your music files on Android versus having to open up iTunes for Apple.
---
mhm, im not gonna be as happy on how this looks with sylvari scaling am i
---
Do strike mission bosses scale? Or were they designed to be geared for 10-man teams? 
---
I’d love to try them with 3-4 of my brothers and dad, but don’t want to wait for a 10 man party.
---
I got notification of reaching 10 giant kills after beating the Ice Construct; so this makes sense now seeing what the scale actually is

Each skritt remembers a different set of words and different complex parts of vocabulary.

Yes I love the flowers in Grothmar. I've mused on a post about my favorite location in Central Tyria being Brisband Wilds sort of.
---
GW2 has beautiful and wonderful locations like the Grove and various Druid holdouts. However all the plants there are specifically crafted assets. They are not the random beauty of the fields.
---
However post PoF you can use the Springer to get on the tops of various rocks/plateaus of Brisband that are cut offs/clipping of the map since they were never designed to be looked at. They are just basic low quality textures, but you can tell they are to represent fields of wild flowers. We finally got that in Grothmar but Brisband will always be special to me b/c of that.

I couldn't agree more. Fluffpaw and Ripshadow are almost IDENTICAL!

Haha!
---
Okay, let's end this discussion with another point, a simple one. 
---
I did the strike missions a few times now. 10 man groups and I saw people going down and even dying. This makes the whole "it's to easy" discussion obsolete.

I did djinn a few times farming difluorite for skyscale a month ago, everyone was just stacking him and, although my computer lags a lot during metas  so it's hard to know for sure, I don't really remember my health going down at all.

&gt; Voice of Metal
---
&gt; Bound Hatched Chili Pepper Home Instance Node
---
Just a general question about your datamining process: 
---
Those two items have two different versions each, one account bound and one not.
---
* Voice of Metal account bound [&amp;AgFgZwEA] GW2ID 92000 from the map vendor
---
* Voice of Metal unbound [&amp;AgE7ZwEA] GW2ID 91963 presumably from rare event or chest drops
---
The same goes for the hatched chili HI node, I spare you the details as you probably know them anyways.
---
Is there a specific reason why you only listed one version or was it just an oversight?
---

Staff guardian, always has and always will be lol
---
I think they meant the ENTIRE episode, aka the entire prologue but Im not very sure either in the way this was phrased.
---
Awesome, thank you! I had stopped trying.
---
It's got a nice autumnal main theme which is appropriate for the season (at least in the northern hemisphere), lovely colours going on. Also a lot of variety in zones, with the ghost area, the aurene crystal area, the ooze pit and keep areas, the forest area. I don't know, I like this map a lot, even though it's missing verticality and griffon territories.
---
The first name ;_;
---
you can find squads on LFG farming. My fav map for farming is Dragonfall, easily make 100g in 3-4 hours but you will go crazy without a flying mount on that map. So I guess Silverwastes or Domain of Istan is a way to make quick gold
---
The charrs say the elemental is summoned and "someone" must be working with the enemy. If that's the case, we can meet that someone on another episode where he/she summons another ice elemental. A full grown one.
---
cheers mate, this was the one I had missed
---
okay, i'm going to try to clarify a bit on what i'm saying, as i'm on my pc
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bolt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bolt)
---
according to the link above bolt is at:
---
BN 2350g 00s 00c 9/18/19 16:14 EST
---
SP 1839g 07s 04c 9/18/19 16:14 EST
---
now those are the tp prices, but the real question is how much is Bolt actually:
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Base\_ingredients\_query](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/Base_ingredients_query)
---
okay this is the base ingredients for Bolt is 
---
1023g 04s 62c 9/18/19 16:14 EST
---
as the "Sell Now Price" or SP/Sell Price are not even close you would most-likely do the BN price as it is the higher profit value. 
---
so the cost is actually:
---
   2350g 00s 00c
---
\-  1023g 07s 04c
---
\------------------------
---
  1326g 92s 96c
---
\-  500g 00s 00c player's cut
---
  826g 92s 96c
---
so 826g 92s 96c is the current profit on Bolt, using as an example and using the TP -info- as a base.
---
now if want to add it the 15% Trade Tax:
---
x                 0.15 
---
\-----------------------
---
352g 50s 00c should be the tax 
---
and as that it is taking away from the profit you would have to subtract the tax from the profit
---
   826g 92s 96c
---
\- 352g 50s 00c
---
\----------------------
---
  474g 42s 96c
---
so the Actual Profit is 474g 42s 96c assuming it is sold on the tp
---
The way your charr... char... charr.. idk looks at the other one. Haha.
---
Apparently it's a rare drop from the chest that you need to do the 4 metas to open
---
No.
---
cycling events are retarded,it has insanely slow rotation for some and kasmeer event is basicly always running. it shoud been fun festival,not do 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-1,if you are unlucky as me,you gona see SAME events over and over and you have to WAIT thru 4 events to get to that you want to do/play.
---
I'm not entirely computer literate, could you please tell me how you went about doing this?
---
Not complaining this shits hilarious. And is pretty damn close to what military and military like organizations are like in real life.
---
The only thing missing is what happens when soldiers get bored. Either something gets broke, someone gets hurt, shit gets stupid. Or all above.
---
Ive heard stories of racing missile loaders. Playing horse with throwing knives and bouncing a knife off someone's helmet. Tank racing. Dodge ball with rocks or empty magazines. Annnnnnnnnnnd... Apparently a water slide without the water....
---
Contact support - it should have been applied automatically.
---
Agree with you. It seems like they like to keep their GoE in their banks without doing anything to them indefinitely. 
---
I had 10 GoE at one point, and it was sitting on my bank for at least 3 years. After crafting my Eternity and Predator I wasn't interested in any gen1 leggies, so the GoE sat at my bank. I've thought about making legendaries and sell them, but I'm fully aware that I am very impatient, and selling them would take a while. Plus I was also working on other legendaries, so I can't really spare the other mats (MC and T6 mostly). So I decided to sell 8 GoE. Gave me a nice 4k gold boost and some precursor skins, that otherwise I won't bother getting.
---
Selling GoM IMHO is for people like myself, the Broke veteran with multiple alts that did map completion because it was "fun" back then, and has a lot of GoE and GoB.
---
&gt; nd sure, there are people who want to learn mechanics. They are doing it already. In raids.
---
And for more than enough people raids are too hard to learn there or too frustrating.
---
I just got dropped a node at the ash meta at the shrine. And have already unlocked the vendor one. They do not act as separate nodes. I was not able to unlock a second node in my home instance. 
---
But yeah .. I was quite confused as well when it dropped.
---
What? I can't hear you over the concert.
---
Ah, yes, those to!
---
Rather long comment, 2nd part is in the subcomment.
---
Strikes are content that is meant for people that don't raid yet to teach them more about mechanics and how raids work more in general. Now I agree that the current state of the strike is not yet a stepping stone for raids, but honestly it is not as bad as people make it sound in my opinion. I am probably among the better raiders still playing the game, so I will do my best to look at this from a non raiders perspective.
---
The boss has around 11.5 million HP, which would mean that you need \~16k group DPS to finish the boss in time, which from a raiders point of view is absolutely nothing. The thing is this content is meant for people that don't raid, those people run in random gear or gear that provides them survivability, they run random traits, skills and they use random weapons. On top of that the composition is also random. Because of this there are most likely no boons and buffs for the group cause people don't use such skills/traits in their open world builds. This will cripple their DPS by alot. Of course they will still easily make the DPS check but if you have a full group of such players you will be at maybe 30-40k DPS, which i guess makes the amount of HP / enrage timer okayish. With such DPS there is also enough time to see all the mechanics in the last phase. 
---
Then there are the actual mechanics. To make this a stepping stone into raids you should look at what raid mechanics are used in multiple raid encounters. Think about things like green circles, breakbars, special action droppable AoE, or shockwaves. Now Anet chose to go for shockwave mechanic to be implemented in the first iteration, and it is probably the easiest one to start with to learn. Now there are also other mechanics like the balls that roll around in a pattern which could be linked to shark mechanics on qadim2 or other damaging things that move in a pattern (storm cloud Matt, death tornado's on sabir etc.). In the last phase you have the orbs that you have to avoid, could be linked to xera for example. Then the last mechanic that is there is the ice blast slam or what ever I should call it. To survive this you gotta be on a specific point, stand on the thing to be able to jump over it. You could see this a little bit as a green circle safe zone type of mechanic, even tho you still gotta jump over the blast. So as you can see all the 4 main mechanics are relate-able to mechanics in actual raids. The problem here is more that there are too few mechanics and they are too slow paced, and the fact that half the mechanics are replaced by other ones after 50% doesn't help either. So on this part I do think it is lacking a little bit, but next iteration might fix this.
---
This is the first strike, and I personally wouldn't expect to see all of the most important raid mechanics in the first strike. Now I do think there should've been something with a breakbar in this fight, because it is used in pretty much every raid encounter and also because I do think there is room for it in this fight. The way I would implement it is probably like twin largos, massive barrier untill the bar is broken, with a 1-2k break bar, which would average then to 100 - 200 CC dmg per player. 
---
Something I do like about the mechanics is that in the first phase you are safe from the balls in melee range and in the last phase you are most safe close behind the boss. I think this incentive is good to let people try to stack up as much as they can as that is what is being done in raids. Now there is one problem to why you don't see this happen in the actual fights.
---
And that is the damage that you take from the attacks is not enough. I think that the aura damage is fine, you can out sustain that with 0 healing power on most classes which should be the case cause there are no guarrenteed healers. But if you barely take damage from the hits there is no incentive to stand on the spots where you will get hit the least and thus people will be scattered all over the place.
---
There is something I don't really specifically see people saying anything about and that is the enrage timer. I have had people in my group that did the strike a few times and just figured out that there was a enrage timer. I think this has to be made more obvious in a way as you see it in literally every raid encounter, regardless of the fact that the enrage timers in raids are irrelevant. And well lets be honest 16k group dps will always be met in a 10 man group, none will actually see the enrage timer run out. A way of fixing this could be making 5 additional soft enrage timers that will make the boss enrage if a timer runs out. So every 2 minutes the boss would enrage, dealing more damage. This would teach about soft enrage timers and also add more pressure to the fight so people have more incentive to stack behind the boss. These timers could also be tied to the additional chests that you will get when you kill the boss.
---
Visually I think mechanics are sometimes hard to see. The white snowy terrain makes the shockwaves sometimes hard to see and the white circle on the things you have to stand on top off are also fairly hard to see. Also the light blue orbs are sometimes a bit hard to spot so on that aspect I think the strike can improve.
---
Thieves should be getting the raid stolen skills instead of the random open world stolen skills. I guess make the stolen skill random so people can see the different onces on the strike boss.
---
Also for the love of god, remove the small chests in the jumping puzzle and make them appear once the boss is killed. None wants to wait 5 minutes until everyone got their chests before you can start killing the boss.
---
Overall I can see the potential of strikes, even tho it still has to undergo some improvements. For me the best thing about strikes is that it has the potential to be a stepping stone into raids while at the same time it being good solo content.
---
Lol whining again in a gaming sub? Who would have thought? Objectives in games are supposed to require time or effort. You all got this shit for free. Work on getting a better job if you demand to go back to farming gold or whatever. GW2 is the cheapest mmo for its quality that exists
---
Having data becomes necessary when constructing an argument that cannot be proven without it. You may fool yourself that you have no bias yet you have a personal interest in being right without the data. That is truly disingenuous.
---
So like a reward track? Do you see every tier before you purchase it? Sounds like they'd need to make it a full-on fremium subscription to even come close to BLCs at which point the anti-subscription crowd will probably trash them for it.
---
Getting 2 fps when I try to load a character. Changing settings did not help at all either. Windows 10.
---
~80g right now. Just recently finished Vision + Coalescence.
---
I usually safe up ~2k, build a legy, have a couple 100 left that i then spend on more trivial things like nice skins I'd like to unlock before I start saving up again for the next legy.
---
Because some people think like you, a vaste majority of player will never try raiding.
---
Get yourself a girl who can do both
---
Had this drop in today on my first trying the Strike Mission. Linked it in chat and started at the skin previews. Was about to select the medium one for my thrift when someone in chat replied that it's selling for 300g on the tp and I couldn't hit that cancel button fast enough. The skin looks cool and all, but no way I'm turning down that much gold. xD
---
I've looked in all those places and he's never there.
---
Yup! Just like a reward track and you could right click and preview what rewards they’d be at each interval, no surprises.
---
And yeah, that is true, with how much stuff they have in the BLCs it would be a bit much. Or the price for the pass would be outrageous unless they cut back on having 2 sets of skins and did a single set of weapon skins, maybe an armor set and mount skin.
---
The contents would definitely have to be juggled around a bit. But the main goal is getting the RNG out of paid cosmetics, knowing what you’re getting.
---
Hey dumb ass, op doesn't have the ability to create his own keyboard using $30 worth of raw materials. We all have the ability grind gold tho.
---
Also they repeatedly say in the interview. To paraphrase: "You can do this yourselves. Talk with your friends, do trades. Bypass the 10-15% BL tax." It takes work and not a lot of people want to do the work, such as the basic mathematics that is OP's post.
---
Also there's the productivity triangle. "Fast, Good, Cheap" you can only pick 2.
---
How have I changed anything negatively for players who *don't* work the markets? Most of the players in the game just *play the game,* they would continue to do so unaffected.
---
&gt; You just described every job in a capitalist economy. You will never get the full value of your labour working for a company. 
---
You also don't get to kill any monsters with swords, what's your point?
---
Probably got red from Primordus mixed in.
---
Prob intentional.
---
I played first time without a guide, then wanted to try a 2nd time by myself for the achievement and found out how easily missable they were, confronting me to the fact that I would have to endure a third time the first episode steps.
---
I don’t mind achievements in general but these (and probably more) are really not respectful of my time nor accessible unless you want to sit through the same stuff over and over again.
---
I just joined a squad specifically going for it on LFG, had 50 people spread over the 3 lanes and got it easily.
---
&gt; Unless you don't play with shaders on "high"
---
Just don't use high shaders during that skyscale orb collect adventure or you'll go mad trying to find or see the orbs.
---
He also hides under the other tank and right north of the bar.
---
Yeah, sorry, was missing 2 locations, added now
---
Didn't the 25 per heart maps also require almost 5x as much to get all the unlocks
---
It'll be like that to stay.
---
You can't do tall trees or cliffs because you can just Skyscale up above them.
---
The big walls in the north above the JP are slightly questionable though. Just let us run atop them.
---
&gt;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
---
Then what does condition damage do?
---
Yeah. I used to have a character named Aerrin and in fact, that's been my username in a lot of places. Come Season 2 they add a Sylvari NPC named Aerin. 
---
I got jealous lol.
---
&gt;The only thing missing is what happens when soldiers get bored. Either something gets broke, someone gets hurt, shit gets stupid. Or all above.
---
I mean, the brig rather tells that story. Not many details sadly.
---
Woaaaaaaaaaah, I loved his Dwalin in The Hobbit... and he nailed it again!
---
I keep crashing at the very last part of "A Race to Arms". Hopefully a hotfix will be deployed soon.
---
I haven't played in quite a while and am curious how classes are now.  
---
I played a Revenant with both the condition damage and healing specs, but I'm curious what other classes have varied specializations, such as condition, power, healing, etc. If any of em feel different than when I last played. Which was quite a while ago.
---
Side note for your trapper friend (and the rest of players): traps work on the boss, but you have to put them just besides the actual body model to activate, but if you put them outside the body (but inside the red area) they don't activate even if the body moves to them afterwards. If it's worth to just follow the body to trap it's another thing...
---
Loaded just now, all works fine. Probably you messed something up.

Anyway, https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-crashes if you want to troubleshoot it.

You came across an egotistical veteran.  Pay them no heed.

&gt; Hello,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Can you please look into adjusting Chronomancer Support wells?
---
&gt;You made  support wells as that classes niche that no one wants to stand in for mediocre boons that anyone else can give out while mobile but these require you to be stationary.
---
&gt;Please have them pulse around you as you move similar to the Function Gyros as they are now a "well". This would help diversify some of the support monopoly that firebrand has especially if you give some of them stability / barrier / resistance.
---
&gt;Literally a terrible choice having a stationary support well with those kinds of boons that no one will stand in any almost any game mode.

---
I've removed d912pxy and arcdps and reinstalling, will see if that works. I do know that other people have the same issue, though.
---
People posted about here, and I think a couple of other posts have said stuff too: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5ssmf/new_build_3_fixed_a_client_crash/
---
I'd have to look up my comment history, but I'm pretty sure I gave this exact answer many years ago.  What's so hard about playing the game and letting the achievement come as they may?
---
Just in time for the aurene brand!
---
\m/
---
The best part about them for me is the number itself. It's a prestige thing for the most part. The awards on the side are nice extras.
---
When I first got there, I thought that gate in the ground would be really cool as a raid or strike entrance lol.
---
I feel it would look better with smaller metallic pieces over the shoulders, and a bit longer textile portion.
---
But it's just my taste.
---
A sizable chunk of the profit from bankrolling a legendary is risk premium.  You'd need a very high trust network to only take a 150g cut to bankroll a legendary.
---
Replying to confirm that I also can't fix those two.
---
&gt; The problem with this is its detrimental to the core game. People who have never flipped at all can drop 10-50k mithril ore, silk scrap etc. on the market, if they want to fuel an expensive purchase that is, so do you limit some markets? 
---
Again, I'm not enough of an economist to come up with the best solution, I know that. It takes a thief to catch a thief. But someone should. 
---
I think that the best limitations would be ones that are not hard caps, but rather soft caps that grind the margins narrower and narrower the more trades you make. That way, small traders would not be impacted at all, and even "hardcore grinders" would be able to make money off of what they get, it would just make it harder to buy low and sell high at competitive rates while still maintaining a profit margin. 
---
I also feel that ANet does a bad job of balancing the markets. Like they'll add a new recipe to the game that requires a lot of a certain mat, but then not add any new supply, so the price shoots up and everyone with a stockpile can turn a huge profit. They should not do this. They should anticipate demand, and say "ok, we're adding a new recipe that will require a ton of leather, but also, here's a short term event that will rain leather like coppers, so eat up."
---
Wintersday "raid" was way too difficult for my guild. They failed hard several times and then never returned to it. GW2 has never "trained" players how to play. Whole of GW2 is mostly faceroll content, there is nearly no "advanced" content which slowly trains players how to play. At this point is GW2 also too old to fix these problems. People played for 7 years like that.
---
Part of the problem is btw. the skill/combat system which has serious flaws:
---
-doesn't tell you if you do something right. Placing a banner has no "visible" impact (which is why so many wars run sigils instead banners)
---
- relies on one hit mechanics. Very difficult to create "medium" difficult mechanics with it. Either you are dead or you aren't. Veterans dodge, it is easy. Beginners don't , die, give up frustrated.
---
Pressure situation in which your healers run out of mana barely exist in GW2 - but are by far superior in "training" players (at handling pressure situations, managing mana etc.). One mistake shouldn't kill you, many mistakes should. GW2 is sadly mostly: one mistake = dead. Very unforgiving game - and you don't learn anything. It's like playing vs. high ranked pvp players, where you also don't learn much. You learn much more from playing against similar skilled players instead of getting steamrolled in seconds.
---
-no castbars, so you need ro read up mechanics in guides - which casuals don't do. Difficult to describe "when he raises his left hand he does X".
---
-difficult to use skills with small timeframes. Aegis blocks one attack and is strong if you manage to block a hard hitting attack. Beginners would block a random attack, negate 500 damage: useless skill for them. 
---
-too limited amounts of support. If one player fails mechanics you can't really place a skill on him and he then facetanks everything.
---
&gt; reduce stab from 5 to 3 stacks
---
&gt; increase necro shade target cap from 3 to 5
---
great, just what we need...
---
The only issue imo is the lack of fun mechanics and damage. What's the point in playing something supportive if no one takes damage?
---
It doesn't have to be difficult, it just has to be fun.
---
Kinda wanna do a thematic Guardian/firebrand build that makes them more like a caster than a paladin or cleric type, in other words a build that uses Scepter/Focus and staff. I know that weapon setup works for a healer but I'm guessing that it doesn't work as well for a condition burn build. I'd still like to use either of those weapons for a condi build, any suggestions on which one to take?
---
Anet talked about expanding existing maps instead of adding new ones, so who knows, maybe you're onto something.
---
O sweet. I'll turn it on just so I can ignore it like in gw1.
---
They can nerf Stand your ground all they want people will still take it over hollowed ground because the stability stays with you as you move, it can be traited to remove a condition and has a lower cd as well.
---
Same goes for Sanctuary.
---
Nobody uses it because of the long CD when there are plenty of other options that do part or all of what it does with shorter CD's.
---
Seriously the only reason I could think of to ever take that is if we had a ton of choke points, if it was also an elite and if I didn't have access to staff or hammer + wall of reflection.
---
Score one for common sense.
---
Yeah i failed the second cub, now i dont wanna do it alone cuz furst instanced part was freakin slooow and doing that events part again would prolly kill me D:
---
Really they just need to redesign a number of utility/weapon skills to be something different so as to lessen the repetition and increase choice (This is true for many classes)
---
Same goes for traits.
---
Clean install of both ArcDPS and D912PXY seems to have done the trick. Thanks for the reply
---
If the range was party-wide it would also actually allow us to play ranged in instanced PvE for once. 
---
Imagine if staff elementalists could actually stand at 1,200 range, imagine if Longbow ranger would be a thing that people care about in PvE, Deadeye rifle, etc.
---
That's one of the reasons I dislike 10-man PvE content in this game, it's just a moshpit of melee people standing on top of each other.
---
The reason nobody uses hallowed ground is because 1. it's not instant 2. is not a stunbreak.
---
That Scourge change sounds really neat. More intense coverage around the shades, but less overall coverage.
---
20g a day from t4 fractals + recs (possibility of more)
---
Then pick one of the living story maps. Episode one has the best reward but can only do the train once per day.
---
After that 2 can be incredibly good as a few of the chain quests can spawn a ton of enemies if ppl show up.

You don't have to min-max on efficiency in this game. Nothing is designed to be so hard as to punish you heavily for not stacking in place.
---
In raids, it's easy to sit in the same place all during the fight because the boss never moves when there's a tank. That's why a lot of raids are so unnecessarily easy. Meanwhile, in most Fractals, especially CMs you're forced to actually use your dodge to not die if you don't have stabitity/aegis to avoid key attacks.
---
I introduce you to: Warframe.
---
&gt; as a T1 fractal in that you can basically just facetank the boss and ignore all mechanics
---
well my friend, let me tell you a story. A story that takes place so long ago that it's now in the archived part of my library and my asuran tech diary bot refuses to go through those to find where that damn entry is. The story goes like this, once upon a time eons ago me, a young adventurer naive and stupid as I was, tried to do T1 fractals for the first time with pugs. Tried. The end. 
---
Never underestimate the sheer lack of interest adventurers have in adventure other than bashing a mob the moment they see them. Ignoring every mechanic and seemingly forgetting how to talk or listen in an instant. Ha ha ha, If I got the chance I'd slap my young naive self so hard he'd remember his future grandchildrens names. Fuck that guy. 
---
Anyway, T4 with guildies is where it's at. Now...who are you again? And why are you in my house?
---
Honestly this patch gave me as a hardcore player that only does raids and every now and then dungeons good content aswell. Strike missions are actually really fun solo content.
---
Yeah I really screwed up on the cubs without thinking about the repeatable nature of it.  Had to restart the whole episode.  Been just ignoring it and get event participation naturally doing other stuff for now.
---
I am very disappointed that they do not play "Medium rare", it is their best song.
---
Duelist pants and boots from core and the new shirt from the reward track/collection
---
So basically what I said.
---
Its just repetitive and bleh compared to options already available.
---
A reason to finally do storys more than once on different characters?
---
Yes, finally Guild Wars can tell me/remind me how long I've been playing. &lt;3
---
I sometimes used to precast it on myself back in the day both in pve dungeons and wvw if I knew shit was about to hit the fan. Couldn’t always get it off especially in wvw but was fun messing around with it regardless.
---
That's a nice way to think of it. I more meant it's a shame you never went back to compare because Mark Meer's performance is really great by the end where it started out pretty bad. It's probably because I've spent too much time on the Mass Effect Sub but my wife and I have come to notice some odd line delivery from J. Hale in the latter entries. Regardless, I'm glad she introduced you to more storied female leads. I wouldn't say she's was alone though. Samus Aran, Jill Valentine, and Jade from BG&amp;E all come to mind for me as characters who broke those old male dominated roles before Shepard.
---
It's a huge charr party...and amidst all the warmongering games etc, there's a metal concert event which is damn cool xD
---
I kind of like them too.
---
Now if only they would rework the traits that grant bonuses based on the number of shades active so they did something else.
---
All that just to get 1 achievement out of 50+, which involve doing 2-hourly events DOZENS of times over (e.g. break up 500? fights at the concert)  to get what?  A fucking emote?
---
Works for me
---
I fail to see how that changes my point. You're right. They aren't a charity. They're a fucking business.
---
Hiya, I found an official statement about capes. I thought I remembered reading an official statement saying that it would be hard due to cloth physics but I may have just rationalized that based on what I see in game on existing cloth material. Anyway, here's an Anet employee statement on the subject:

&gt;Capes work in Guild Wars 1 because we only had human characters and our armor "footprints" were pretty standardized. As such, their absence in GW2 was an unfortunate casualty of moving to a MUCH more complicated composite system, and our increasing character art standards. Capes are tricky even when you have finite sets of armor to work off of, but when you go and build a system designed to be highly expandable, making sure capes work with all those possibilities without clipping across the ten different race/gender combinations, well it just became a WAY bigger deal.
---
I would have edited my original comment but I thought you may want the notification so you'd actually see the information lol Sorry
---
why is your name highlighted in red? At first I thought you were a dev.
---
It should be progressive.
---
You have been playing for 1 hour.
---
You have been sitting there for 2 hours.
---
You have been dormant for 3 hours.
---
It's 4 hours, you really should get up and stretch.
---
It's 5 hours, surely you at least have to take a leak.
---
It's 6 hours what the fuck is wrong with you.
---
I'd pay for that upgrade.
---
I don't know if it bugged out for you but I could tell which stomper I already did by the lack of brand around it and it properly working. 
---
Don't have any solution to he Balloon Problem though
---
The scene where the Fellowship of the Ring is formed is really awkward when replaced by innuendos.
---
Where do you guys go for guides nowadays since Dulfy is MIA?
---
I really should catch up with the game...
---
Any good guides up yet?
---
See. Thats one of the reasons I love guild wars. I need to go back and finish the story some day.
---
How is 10 target shade anything but a ridiculously massive and unnecessary buff to scourge?
---
It barely gives any, there's no side bonus like VM on gather, there's no consume use, and while I haven't checked the new foods out yet I doubt they're comparable to ascended food.
---
I highly regret buying this node because I am going to reach a point where I am literally just deleting them for lack of a use.
---
Put a big shade away from your squad and you can't cleanse conditions or give barrier around you, not even yourself. Um... ok...
---
This is the first of a series of videos I hope to get started focusing on teaching a newer or less market savvy player how to use the trading post effectively. I hope this offers a good primer on what I consider the main concepts that drive a virtual market. Using this as a baseline I would like to move forward teaching players how to use the incredible amount of data available through the Guild Wars API to learn how to create a portfolio that generates consistent income, regardless of the market conditions. Please leave a like and a subscribe, I look forward to making more content for our wonderful community :)
---
I’m probably right there with you.
---
That's fine, I'm sure there are other games out there for aesthetically-challenged people.
---
Why is it bad design? I prefer to have non account bound options.
---
You should really consider joining our economy discord if you plan on doing this more. [https://discord.gg/PcHH6Kr](https://discord.gg/PcHH6Kr)  
---
The only thing I dislike about this post is begging for likes and sub :&gt; They will come naturally when you pump out good content
---
Username checks out
---
Yet again Anet shows a complete lack of understanding of why scourge is so strong in WvW. The increase to number of targets will in all probability make scourge even more oppressive in WvW.
---
Hi, I finished the video! [Here it is](https://youtu.be/KynWMprnJqo)
---
Tech Debt 2: "It's just a small hack" Saga
---
now i have ptsd
---
Due to the increase to number of targets so long as sand savant is traited this 'nerf' is probably a buff in WvW. Therefore in WvW the strongest offensive class will be even stronger.
---
Pretty much this. Instead of spending effort figuring out how to game a fictional market, I just put that effort into my real life career and investments. Hell of a lot easier to just play how/when I want and drop a hundred bucks for gold when I'm out
---
They're good at keeping secrets. And making you open up to yours
---
&gt;You're rewarding now whoever try to minmax their farming, instead of playing the rest of the content. 
---
But that is already how it works, so, again, how is that *changing* anything for the worst?
---
So apparently the microphones were already around in the time of the Khan-Ur?
---
Alternately, the legions looted that vault ages ago, and replaced it with new stuff for the festival ... would explain how you get the keys.
---
I would suggest doing all the missing LS episodes and other content you missed. Dragonfall is a particularly good gold farm. 
---
By the way, post on r/guildrecruitment for that last bit.
---
They're getting harder to find....
---
Date him
---
Thank you for that second one, I was wondering how to get it.
---
&gt; I said you are wrong because in your post you are implying that this is a design flaw and a problem that needs to be solved due to poor balancing, but the reality is that even with trade restrictions people will always find ways to profit off of others. 
---
And in PvP players will always find ways to make one class more effective than others. That's when you do a balance pass.
---
There's also a collection achievement that you can get by moving items back and forth between your bank and inventory a few times.
---
It's not *every* single NPC. Only a disconcertingly large fraction of the male Charr.
---
You stack your group with scourges have half use ranged shades, have half wait for push. Make no mistakes this is a buff to scourges in WvW.
