Once I played with a dagger/shield spellbreaker running full signet build, who started kicking people because we didn't have enough dps
---
---
---
They are still in my inventory and all I have done is the ball and the legs
---
He just lived in another plane of existence, we can't comprehend how superior he is with our inferior meta builds
---
&gt;25-30 levels per hour
---

---
You mean per day, right?
---
The fact that you don’t have any sense of punctuation, sentence structure or spelling, it makes it REALLY hard to assume you’re even average at this game. How can I trust someone to dps, disengage or rotate in any meaningful way if they say shit like “memdium” 
---
Next time you get mad, think about what YOU could to do improve the outcome.
---
3/10
---
Real good, but Meowth was a cat not a rat.
---
Idk I am afraid we wont be getting another expansion :(
---
Due to the inefficiency of supplies it takes to open the gates, I say this again but salvaging your own siege weapons should be an option.
---
In order to counter balance, you can only salvage:
---
- when you have a warclaw (add another mastery)
---
- your own siege weapons at 50% of supplies returned. For example, treb takes 100 to build, so you can salvage 50 supplies; rams and catas cost 40, so you get 20 back.
---
- other people's siege weapon after 10 minutes that way you can't troll someone who's not done using them.
---
Other interesting ideas:
---
- warclaw has its own pocket of supplies with a higher limit, but can only be used for pulling. Limit is now 25 "tugs"
---
- if only 5 "tugs" left, then dmg should be in line with superior rams
---
- unmanned catas, trebs, balistas can now be dragged around by a warclaw (another mastery), but travel speed is halfed and cannot use dash. Prolly imba when rams can be dragged around so cannot do that.
---
Buy winters day gifts.
---
They give a bunch of quartz and can also drop charged quartz too
---
But if you're going to do that then you also need to make full dead players not contribute to the scaling of the boss as well. That'd work to yeah, but it wouldn't be addressing the main issue of people not wanting to waypoint in the first place.
---
meowth is horrifying holy shit
---
Holo can also face tank it with AED
---
We don't know that, and I'd rather choose to be hopeful than completely close off that thought.
---
Abandoned? I dont think so, only  skyscale and the Bug will not be necessary due to living World and therefore is not everyone in the future able to use them.
---
Reddit will downvote this for sure, but I had a similar experience with a condi staff reaper. Did less damage than support, provides no boons and does not CC enough, calls the rest of the group elitist for removing him.
---
The ironically toxic casual side of the community will insist you can play literally anything and any way you want.
---
How do you manage that?? I wish I had half that time on my hands! Teach me your secret!
---
While things like Xera and Matthias are defaulted to hard mode for the casual community.
---
That would be an incredibly nice compromise. Full dead shouldn't contribute to the scaling, and should be unable to be rezzed during combat to balance the exclusion from scaling. That way, people who are trying hard aren't penalized by others, but also new players that don't have a nearby waypoint yet can feel OK waiting for the fight to end and be rezzed.
---
But then how will I know if this rose has thorns and where they are ?
---
craft the cheapest ascended then convert to berserker, at least that used to be the way, not sure if berserker is cheap now days.
---
If you're going through the story then consider this a warning: when you reach Heart of Thorns the difficulty ramps up significantly compared to the core game.
---
The maps will be challenging to navigate at first with limited masteries and the mobs will beat on you at every opportunity. It's a trial by fire and it will force you to 'git gud' but eventually you'll turn into Tyria's answer to Tarzan and you'll be crusing around the jungle without problems.
---
It uses supply and it's *barely* more damage than PVD (probably the equivalent of 2-4 players auto-attacking), all while locking you in place. To top it all off, just in case they accidentally made it useful, only three people can use Warclaw against a gate at one time.
---
The only reason I think anyone uses it is that there's an achievement for it... 1 million damage against gates to max out the AP, wasting a total of 500 supply.
---
[removed]
---
afaik dead people still upscale events. so those lazy folk are not only leeches, but also an active burden.
---
I've got mixed feelings, honestly. The fact that mounts exist basically means every new map needs to be mount-friendly. On the other hand, putting mounts on a mastery track seems kind of unnecessary if new features are going to be introduced as well. PoF worked because each map had an associated mount (sort of) when you started the expansion.
---
&gt; does a f2p player who only has access to core, use the same game engine as those who have completed S4?
---
Yes. The game runs on only one engine. Pretty sure this is true for all games.
---
No problem, I've took the artistic freedom and altered it a bit
---
I agree that the fully dead should WP (for the most part. If you just went fully dead and the WP is far away and the boss is at 5% or something then by all means stay there). 
---
However, I also think that if someone is worrying about the difficulty level of world bosses, well, eh.... 
---
In other words, I agree they should WP... but I don't see this as even a small annoyance to the still alive in 99% of cases.
---
Better than moot loot
---
Chest is either Elonian or Spearmarshal's. Shoulders are Houndskin Mantle from Draconis Mons Mastery achievement. Face mask is... ~~forgot the name but it's a rare drop in Dry Top from Zephyrite chests~~ Adventurer's Scarf.
---
Don't know the rest
---
but why, i mean the raid is nice, they would only have to tweak the numbers to make it last longer, i mean there is no dps check at all, not even in CM's
---
max with the world first buyer pov

nice video and congratz :)

Hullo friend! It seems to me you'd have more fun if you worked on playing the game while minding your own business! If someone is dead, that's their deal and has nothing to do with you. Everything in open world is a faceroll, and the scaling from dead players will not stop you from winning, so really it's just a case of you not being content with being in charge of your own gameplay, and instead wanting to police others' actions in open world as well!
---
If you find dead player scaling is making things too hard for you, I guess you should take a taste of your own elitism and get good.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
An actual suggestion: a toggle that prevents you from rezzing full-dead players in combat, such that while you turn this option on your F skill will not work on full-dead players (like in WvW) preventing you from accidentally wasting time grabbing a full-dead when you meant to be helping a downed player instead.
---
 I say a toggle, because there are times when people want to be able to pick up full-dead players. For instance: when I tag up, I will ALWAYS do my best to rez those following, no matter how dead they are. Of course in certain fights I would absolutely love to prioritize down-state, so perhaps I could see a few instances where even I would use such a toggle.
---
The way I envision it is that core expac mastery tracks are relevant to the expac itself like new unique mechanics, and season tracks would maybe add new abilities to our mounts that's relevant to the content. I don't see them adding new abilities for the sake of it, they've always had a purpose; they've always been relevant.
---
Like others have already said, getting gold and straight up buying it would probably be faster, but if you want to gather quartz yourself, there are: 
---
- 3 regular nodes in Dry Top, 2 at the exact same locations every day, one that has about 3 spawn places that are super close together, so it's easy to check them and get it anyway. (See wiki.)
---
- 1 rich node also in DT, but you need to get to tier 4 on the map and beat the skritt queen during the sandstorm, since the node is in her cave. You can bypass the event and sneakily farm the node without beating her, but you still need tier 4 and then to wait 10 min into the sandstorm for her cave to open.
---
- 1 "regular" node in home instance, it can give 3 quartz like other regular nodes, but also 8 quartz and sometimes even a directly charged quartz. If you know someone who has the home instance node, I think it's worth trying your luck with it. You can get it yourself during the Festival of the Four Winds (and you can also get tons of quartz then). Festival should start at the end of July. 
---
- 1 rich node in Crystal Oasis, up at Glint's Legacy. It always spawns in the same place so you can park and alt there. It's easier than the one in Dry Top, though there are branded griffons that attack you sometimes. 
---
- 2 regular nodes in CA at Glint's Legacy, but the spawn locations vary. (See wiki.)
---
These are all possible nodes you can gather in game right now. If you do a full tour, you can get 35/day, without the home instance one. Which works out fine, because you need 25 to transform into 1 charged quartz, and that has a daily limit. It all depends on how much effort you wanna put into it.
---
r/TIHI
---
There's a tomb for Goren, at least. Odd they'd add that but not the freakin' dragon/wyvern.
---
There will definitely be more expansions. The entire point of the restructuring and layoffs was that NCSoft was forcing them to focus on GW2's profitability first and foremost. Nothing generates profit and growth like an expansion.
---
ANet doesn't have a choice in this. NCSoft has assumed direct control of their direction. Expansions are coming.
---
And vine wrath is different, and considered by the wiki not to be a world boss, that would be a great exception to it if it was yeah.But all the world bosses have waypoints near them ( again world boss as indicated on the timers from the wiki, and portal device). But yeah Modnir would be another good case because the nearest waypoint becomes contested until it's over, but isn't one of the first thing you do in a new map (at least for me) is get the nearest waypoints as you approach them? And sure yeah the arguement is not everyone plays the game that way and it's true. I'm not trying to punish the new players either, but there are ways to keep everyone in play if they approach it properly.
---
no u
---
What they need to do is make it random per aerodome instance. :p
---
This is only tangentially related, but on the subject of combat toggles: toggling off the ability to pick up others' bundles. Trying to rez my friend and instead I stole the ele's lightning hammer...isn't always great.
---
Even if they don't do anything about the scaling it will at least solve the problem of dead people getting in the way of ressing downed players.
---
Over months.
---
Yes.
---
that would definitely force raiders to pay attention
---
We all feel this one - deep in our river of souls @&gt;@
---
This is asking a lot, but I want them to move into a new mastery paradigm with whatever the next "chapter" is (i.e. post-PoF).
---
Prior to PoF, I wouldn't have expected them to revolutionize MMO mounts. Credit where credit is due, they did revolutionize them to such an extent that mounts in all other MMOs feel incredibly lazy.
---
So I want to see them revolutionize movement in another way. Technically, they can probably just ship a new mount every time they want to add a significant movement change, but I'd kinda rather they didn't. Thing is, I don't know what else they can do that would be as impactful as mounts have been, with land and air already dominated.
---
That leaves water, which is a touchy subject.
---
However, it also leaves "space". There are numerous areas in PoF and season 4 that take place either in "space" or in areas with unnatural physics. And throughout season 4, they've built new engine tech (they call it "Wind Tech" internally) that could possibly be used in the mastery system.
---
Some things I could foresee are:
---
- The ability to reverse gravity to stay alive in areas where you can fall into the sky.
---
- The ability to orbit around targets.
---
But I can't really think of much else. It's a bit weird that they added wind tech through season 4 but seemingly didn't use it much in the mastery system. Maybe it's actually used in some of the mounts.
---
Stealing this look, thanks.
---
yeah, Never like picking up an FGS or something and screwing with an ele's rotation just trying to rez someone, always makes me feel bad T.T
---
&gt; A) Better hurry, but participation isn't affected by area so what's it matter if you aren't the first person to loot the chest? It'll still be there. Just don't switch maps.
---
This is not quite correct. If the boss dies and you are too far away you will lost the drops that comes from the boss. Ground and popup chests are fine. Not sure about the exact distance limit but it should  be somewhere between 3000 and 5000.
---
I have lost a bunch of loot from the lyssa event back when Orr temples were still a popular thing. That wasn't even from being dead. I was just in the outer ring defending so that the force field thing around the center wouldn't be brought up. After that happened a few times I just stopped bothering to do it. If the field comes up then the fight can just drag on longer for everyone.
---
Thats a very complacent opinion to have, cant be too much to ask if people want a reason to run harder content more than once in a lifetime
---
Yes, Teq is probably the only one that can possibly fail because of this... but it also irritates me a lot at Golem Mark II because 1. the waypoint is *right there* so there's no excuse not to take it and 2. the boss is already one of the most boring and tedious bosses in the game (both the killing and the wait leading up to it), and when half the players are dead it takes twice as long. I just want the thing to die so I can go on with my day.
---
I know, I know, it doesn't really take *that* long; but it *feels* like forever.
---
GW2 is far from p2w. Everyone has near identical stats in end game. Gem store is all vanity and convenience but no effect on character stats. This game is definitely one of the few that is more skill based than p2w imo.
---
Well, you can't buy power in the cash shop, but you can buy skins. If you consider that pay to win, you might not like this game. On the other hand, you can farm everything in game, including gems for the cash shop. So if you farm gold, you can buy cash shop gems and never pay a dime.
---
Hard to say with your description. I don't consider this game pay to win. You pay for convenience and skins mostly.
---
Where is my 7 fps squad at?
---
You know you could've posted your look without throwing shade at OP? Even though I prefer yours better.
---
Earlier bosses in a wing being easier makes more sense. Qadim is considerably easier than his original fight (despite supposedly being much more powerful) and the other djinns serving him. My group killed it in the second pull we got past 80% and we didn’t even understand the link mechanics in the last 20% at all. The personal skill level required on that boss is less than a t4 fractal.
---
thank you, this answers my question
---
You usually stack out of line-of-sight from the enemies in question, usually around a corner or behind an obstruction. This causes them to be forced to walk to you, and if multiple enemies are present, they will all have to walk to the same spot. The end result is that multiple enemies are in the same spot ready to be cleaved down, and also ranged enemies are forced to come to you instead of shooting you from afar.
---
There are strong PoF and strong HoT builds, as well as some core builds. You can always play those :)
---
P2W is something in which the more you pay, stronger you become. F2p part is more like a trial.
---
Remember that they allow the spaghetti binds of CTRL+, Shift+, and Alt+... and I think CTRL+Shift+.
---
It's funny that you call it "toxic" and admit, in the same breath, that all he's asking for is "decent" DPS.
---
I dislike the culture of booting people from casual groups due to a lack of perfection/Discretize-like numbers (they certainly have a right to if they choose to, I just wish they were nicer about it), but at the same time there *does* have to be some kind of standard at T4. They weren't asking him to be phenomenal, they were just asking him to manage the bare minimum for his role.
---
No, title is correct. Character appears in animes for virgins.
---
someone need a sarcasm detector it seems
---
This would be fighting fonts.
---
Hope you are joining the team now :)
---
One little correction :
---
Legendary weapons of the first generation indeed can be traded (as long as you didn't Equip them/bind them to your account after crafting) but it's still just a Stat raise of a few % (5-7?) compared to exotic, a "special" skin and the convenience to swap stats on the fly. And it's really not that hard to max out your crafting professions to craft an Ascended weapon, which is on par Stat wise
---
&gt;Isn't it possible to say, spend $10,000 on gems, exchange all of those gems for a ridiculous amount of gold, and then buy gear that others have spent 2 years to grind and get?
---
Nah, Coz no gear in this game takes 2 years to get.
---
Yes you can get endgame gear quicker but you'll be saving like a 2 week grind at most and we never get stronger gear and haven't for years.
---
and im pointing out the only thing that fits this. only way to make your character significantly stronger by spending real money is buying expansion
---
If they plan to monetize LS5 as people are speculating, I doubt part of that would be mount abilities.
---
Your first screenshot has virtually nothing being rendered... how exactly is this an actual comparison?
---
I could very easily gather screenshots showing the opposite if I were to use similar testing standards.
---
I think mounts are part of the reason they are doing another season instead of an xpac
---
see my first comment
---
As a sidejack (side note/hijack lovechild?), DPS meters are great tools but should only ever be used for self improvement and not to exclude under-performers. Not saying that is completely possible in this game, but it is ideal.
---
Here everyone is hating on Meowth, and I'm just remembering how much I hate most of the male models in this game. They are just so ... weirdly proportioned.
---
Thank you :) . And thinking about the toggle a little more it'd be interesting if they implemented a coding so that anyone in combat can only rez those downed. While being out of combat would allow anyone to be rezzed instead of making it a settings option like how I originally interpretted this toggle idea.
---
Dont know who designed that asura face and decided to make three variations of it.
---
This glyph suppouse to work as balance tool, to keep prices of specific items from growing too high. 
---
Glyph of bounty straight up gives you more loot. Extra character slots and alts accounts raining you with extra stuff. So, thats not a p2gr (pay to get rich) but glyph is?
---
I haven't been having as many issues recently but gw2's API is having issues which are affecting this.
---
Instead of posting this picture why dont u spend some time in golems training and learn how to do dps? Learn the rotation bro, sont destroy other people's clear runs when u dont know how to play a dps class and nags about dps meter. 
---
GET GOOD.
---
My necro is purple does that count
---
Learn to dodge. Dodges are insanely overpowered in gw2 compared to other games. They essentially make you invulnerable for half a second. Timing them right can nullify entire boss mechanics and dodging big hits will keep you alive against champions for much longer.
---
0% pay to win.
---
In addition to what others have said some bosses also don't use certain skills when you stack. The best examples of this are in AC: if you stack properly for the gravelings they won't burrow, which adds time. Another example is the lieutenant right after the gravelings in AC. If you stack he won't use his spin move where he basically 1 shots your entire party, and he also won't dash away.
---
After trying many MMOs in the past, I think this is the farthest from P2W you can get in an MMO. PvP uses standardized stats so there is zero gearing required to get into that (and ranked is a great source of gold). In PvE, I can get myself geared up in the second-best gear in the game for almost nothing (level 76-ish exotic gear is on the TP for about 30 silver a piece, Verdant Brink lets you get level 80 exotics for 1 gold and map currency). For context, doing your dailies nets you 2 gold. From there, you can get into almost every aspect of end-game content except higher level fractals. Raids and Fractals will occasionally give you the best gear in the game for just playing.
---
&gt; you can get in an mmo

In Soviet Russia, an mmo can get in **you**!
---
^(this post was made by a highly intelligent bot using the advanced yakov-smirnoff algorithm... okay, thats not a real algorithm. learn more on my profile.)
---
I can see your point, but I think that's not really true in most cases. You can do really well as a core necro, core thief, hell core warrior is one of the better builds! I also hope that their look at adding more downsides to elite specs will reduce this issue.
---
Thank you!

You could have all the money in the game and still be trash at gw2. That should answer it

You are correct. Unfortunately, I’m a very on and off player cause of work. So I can’t fiddle around with armor as much.  😅
---
Oh, princess wand goes without saying. Staff makes for more appealing pose tho!
---
&gt;Visual clarity
---
&gt;Can hardly tell if I have an aura up nowadays
---
I see no downside in making the warclaw have some more usefulness in PvE. If anything that drives up the desire to get one even more and will funnel more people into WvW.
---
At the very least, I want the damn thing to have the three evades like it has in WvW with the mastery unlocked. This in particular has always bothered me.
---
yep were all been there xD that silly misstep
---
I take a middle ground.  [https://i.imgur.com/5sQiycP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5sQiycP.jpg)
---
Disagree, you will be able to tell someone isn't pulling their weight without a dps meter, you just may not know who right away.  This way, I can remove someone who claims to be exp when they are fucking terrible.  I will add that it entirely depends what your group requirements are.  If you are a dps class and are pulling less than supports are, you should be kicked because you are getting carried and wasting people's time.
---
I've been ripped apart because I have kicked people from fractal lfg's who have joined and pinged the 200 or w.e kp and then are doing less dps than supports.  If you think that is toxic, don't fake kp and do endgame content.  Just because it is possible to essentially 4 man doesn't mean anyone should waste their time carrying a shitter.
---
For the time I have been asking for this! :D
---
It's the last one of your listings.
---
No it's not, it is 100% legal as confirmed by Anet.  Please don't spread misinformation like this.
---
umm full dead players DO NOT scale up a boss. in fact they down scale him.
---
Carapace did not age well. Its textures stretch so much :|

This made me want to try raids! Cheers on your kill!

So I can't make a joke? :/
---
The worst part about that subreddit is idiots like you not understanding its purpose but using it anyway because it makes you feel smart.

My point was that there is no reason to name this a sylvari exclusive problem. I'm not "missing" the joke that its annoying to hear your character say how valuable junk is. I'm saying all races do it.
---
*cough*
---
I think you mean **Hero**. lol
---
But yes, this is how support should work.  Though it would be nice if we had a way to see bugs that have been reported in-game and if they are being processed.
---
That is my fear too
---
I doubt it. Usually when you try something like that, it says "You can't transform while already transformed," or something to that effect.
---
this is technically really good but the meowthe is cursed
---
#2 and #3 are basically useless in WVW.  I don’t think anyone from WVW would be upset if the allowed these skills in PVE as they would be even more useless there.
---
It’s like a tier 1000 WVW gate.
---
thank you Delta!!!
---
It’s less damage than a zerk/marauder staff ele hitting the gate actually.
---
You know, when I ran T4s &amp; CMs with friends about 1-2 weeks ago we filled up and asked for a Banner Warrior (BS).  We got 3 Reapers and a Tempest before someone respected our LFG enough to hop on the proper class that we asked to play with.  
---
Firebrand-Renegade puts out between 9-12 boons with a pre-stack.  If you can't break support DPS with that much special help then you're not making use of the **sacrifices** that support players endure to give the party a shot at smooth sailing.  It's rude, disrespectful and extremely frustrating to watch people squander abnormally good boons on garbage gameplay when they're easily replaceable with players that'll put in a more sincere effort.  
---
Casual players act like everything is "toxic elitism."  No, it's not toxic elitism to expect that people run decent build and have a grasp of their rotations and skill priorities.  It isn't elitism to expect someone to hit 70th or 80th percentile DPS *in endgame PvE* that's **average**."  Toxic Elitism is being unnecessarily rude or abrasive; telling people to uninstall, kill themselves, racial slurs etc.   
---
Most of the time when plays are kicked in 70th or 80th percentile groups there is nothing said to them.  It only usually becomes an issue when they get passive aggressive, frustrated or kicked before an end-chest if they're being particularly virulent.  The truth is that individual performance matters in endgame PvE -- especially in Fractal CMs --- and under-performing puts a significant burden on the group -- especially if other such mechanical or suitability issues are not being addressed.
---
Endure Pain on warrior DOESN'T work. GG Anet.
---
100%. Can't stop it now. I even starteb doing it in other games
---
3 warclaws doing pulls is less than half of the damage of a regular ram.  It’s useless except for AP, or maybe to alleviate boredom while waiting for the gate to go down.
---
I wish it were the Asura who went to fight destroyers and dwarves stayed back as playable race.
---
"A one time gem purchase that grants you significantly more income generation than other players is a problem." 
---
This is actually not the case and not a problem you can usually buy the tools from the karma tool merchants i assume they disabled/removed it due to bugs for the moment. You can just use bounty instead in the short term until its fixed.
---
Everything WVW is account bound now.  When you gain WXP it adds to the pools of all characters.  You can allocated the points to different things per char too.  I think only the WVW exotic armor is soulbound, I can’t think of anything else that is off of the top of my head.
---
I'm slowly slogging through it, but having been sick the last few weeks it's been painfully slow for me. @\_@ And I am worried I'll be so far behind getting it will be more difficult because less people are out there doing it, too.
---
At least the three stamina bars.
---
He was rezzing duh.
---
Not entirely.  That’s all it is after you get ascended or legendary gear, and it really isn’t worth buying exotics for the stats, but it is still technically possible.
---
What about those that have no friends? :(
---
My bad - I was thinking of gem store skins and now realize you didn't mention that.
---
No guildies either? And it still counts on down state which we're not changing in this thread. Full dead isn't required for Skyscale or at least wasn't when I went through.
---
I think downstate counts as well, and its an easy achievement to do if you know good locations where a lot of NPCs die from an event.
---
So then, what’s the point of the last mastery point then? AP and to RP?
---
See there ya go...
---
Really? How do wet set this up?
---
You're right. It would have been much better.
---
This is not true; you can test this out with a party for yourself.
---
Yeah exactly. It's just needless tension between people wanting to win and those wanting to lose (like wanting the event to succeed for fail) that creates conflicts and goes against the cooperative environment GW2 is trying to foster.
---
Do you guys usually do recommended fractals or just the dalies? It seems like the recommended fractals give less loot?
---
&gt; also, i just found it it gives you the option to turn off the story message on the right side...
---
Uhmm, I remember some Immersive Mode add-on did something like that back then. However, isn't that altering game memory? Build templates have at least been co-designed with ANet, but I doubt this was.
---
It wasn't a utility skill, but a trait.

Local.dat increases in "C:\\Users\\\*\*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Guild Wars 2" after awhile I've noticed . My guess is when you delete it your no longer loading  the bloat the file accumulated hence you load faster. Other than that I've never noticed any other performance improvements from it.

So 35 mastery points better spent elsewhere, good to know. You’d think for a mastery tree that the final skill of a total amounts worth would be on-par with a ram at least

I've tried multiple levels. I'm exactly at the name/text Beam of Light and still nothing. I'm sorry, I know it's not related to the Skyscale, but I wanted this achievement while getting my materials for the Skyscale as it is a time-gated achievement. So I figured two weeks ago, that while I'm doing the mat farm (I'm slow at farming), I could as well progress this rather easy achievement every day so that I don't have to in the future. And also figured, the map has a lot more players doing the events, making it easier to complete some of the achievements, now that everyone is there to farm for Skyscale and new trinket.

I think bottom line is because they are mostly wholesome people who like to help others lol

It's not the size but how you use it?

Thankfully, I've never used it in my life. I cannot imagine ad'ing or wiggling around.. it's bad enough with perma 300 ping.

You come across as someone who is actually incredibly insecure about their financial situation, and is hoping by bragging to strangers in this thinly-veiled rant, you'll claw back some self-esteem if we seem impressed.

Nobody called you poor and you got defensive anyway. Feeling the need to insult people on their spending habits is something most adults with real jobs and responsibilities grow out of doing.

What we have ingame aren't heels. They're basically just men's shoes, a slight cutaway between the front of the sole and the heel. Though I don't use the boots at all ingame regardless, they're too bulky for my liking.

This bug might be related to a gw2 beta event where branded invaded the plains and turned players branded, then those players turned other players branded.
---
This event highly unlikely because its tied to the mystic forge which of course if tied to the new raid through the Djinn.

Amen brother.

No, should that matter? I'll give it a try though!

---
Nope, there are only a few things that could be considered "wrong". And those mostly involve sabotage or trolling your server mates (say deliberately tagging over someone to cause confusion). Mostly everything else that works for the benefit of the people around you is legit; regardless of whatever arbitrary rules some may attempt for enforce for whatever reason. 
---
People that decide that just because you have an icon over your head, means that they own you are just fools that can't get anything done themselves, and should be ignored. If what you are doing is stupid, or wrong, or whatever, you'll find yourself without followers pretty quickly anyways meaning a tag that isn't effective is a problem that fixes itself anyways. So the problem is with them (why can't they get people to do what they want-- it's because the majority of the map does not care about what they want.
---
tl;dr Salt. Lots of it.
---
Yeah.. I use all of those, but they still display the events.. :(
---
I mean how much of an advantage is it.. when 99% of your game play is going to be centered around your character.  You aren't going to be looking in your top right corner hardly.
---
ends in a random raid or the old Swamp fractal.
---
First of all in open world, dungeons, low tier frac it doesn’t matter what build you play. If you find yourself squishy try using other gear, maybe another trait line. It does’t hurt trying new stuff out to figure it all out. 
---
HP farming for one of your elite specs is done with in an hour. Especialy in PoF it shouldn’t take you longer than an hour.
---
Now for PvP since I can’t realy help you with raids. In PvP herald is the best option yes, about core idk I’ve never tried it myself. Renegade in PvP isn’t that great. I tried it myself for funs but it’s too weak compared to the other classes. If you want to play Renegade in PvP i suggest going something tanky with consi combined. Kala-Shiro. That’s what I would run with it.
---
Reaper: well yes if you go solo against everything with reaper that’s not going to help if there are a lot of kite spots or if you are facing a high mobile build. Necros were always meant for teamfights and rarely for solo play. I’d suggest keeping yourself there most of the time. (And with teamfights I don’t mean sticking on mid, I mean following your team around. Unless they do something utterly stupid then that’s not worth it.)
---
Holo on the other hand is very good zt kiting, solo play and isn’t bad in teamfights either. 
---
I don’t realy know what builds you use for PvP, so I can’t fully judge. 
---
Basicly: play what you like, unless you want to kill stuff fast quickly or win I’d suggest sticking around the meta. Personnaly I would advice you to make your own builds for meta classes like holo, reaper etc. You learn more that way, and figure out what is good and what is bad. 
---
I hope this helped you, cheers.
---
Me too thanks
---
Let me finish my coffee so I can read your mind and I'll come back and answer some of these.
---
As fucking amazing mounts in GW2 are, they do the same thing flying mounts in WoW did: you blast past everything and all terrain design gets invalidated. Beetle, Raptor, Springer, Skyscale, Griffon - I don't have to care about anything anymore. Nothing is out of reach, nothing is off limits, nothing will need progression before I can reach it.
---
Mounts are a pretty limited thing. Anet's already scraping the bottom of the barrel to still make them disctinct. What's left to do with them they don't already are able to, besides small fry stuff like carrying a passenger?
---
I was referring to the image that was in the link at the time that I commented on it, not the one you changed it to later.
---
also why do they need to be so far apart?  
---
just put them next to each other for way easier access.
---
What's the deal with potential monetization?
---
I'd love it. Boss scaling needs to become more dynamic, though. Right now a dead leecher doesn't de-scale the boss, it takes minute**s** for the boss to scale down again. That would need to be changed down to a minute or maybe a half.
---
A guy telling another he wishes the game went down the shitter just to spite him? Far worse attitude than any entitled customer's if you ask me.
---
And yet that directly contradicts what the original poster stated. The fight changes considerably with additional roles. The difficulty is secondary to that.
---
(Side-note: Watch it in 4K, even if you're watching this on a 1080p screen! Better quality :)
---
Raptor has higher base speed than jackal on flat land, and due to the way the jump works, it is faster for gaps and decreasing elevation. If there is any significant increase in elevation in the desired path and not enough decreasing, then jackal will win out, which is the case for most areas of most maps. The biggest case of raptor superiority is seen in the Crystal Oasis race. Apart from the one steep climb (which has a large gap as part of it), the course is either flat or downhill- the two areas the raptor excels in. That's why raptor racers tend to beat out the jackal racers on that course.
---
Who knows. That doesn't change anything I outlined in my post though.

The easiest way to get some quick gold to gear up in exotics are: Dailies!
---
You can find them in your achivement tab in the hero Panel (press H). They are at the top left. What you wanna do as a new player are the easy PvE dailies. They are usually something like "mine some ore in the Shiverpeak Mountains (all snowy-regions)" or "do 4 events in Metrica Province". Once you complete 3 dailies you will get 2 Gold.
---
2 Gold is already pretty decent, since some exotic gear costs maybe 40 silver per piece on the Trading Post. Which means you could technically fully gear your character in exotics within 4 days. To find the cheapest exotics, you can use the filter function to the top left in the Trading Post. The little "cogwheel" icon. Choose lvl 80, rarity "exotic", then maybe a stat or two that you are looking for. If you click on the price tab, it will sort the results from cheapest-to-most expensive. 
---
You can also get some exotic armor with specific stats by doing Dunegons and buying the gear from the dunegon tokens that you get. If I remember correctly, gear should be around 80 - 120 tokens each or something. You can check the wiki for that though.
---
Another easy way to get some Gold are Worldbosses. They sometimes drop a nice exotic that you can sell on the Trading Post. Other then that, try to sell everything of value on the Trading Post. Once you have enough gold to gear up, you should get into salvaging and keeping the materials for future use, when you start crafting. (Don't worry about crafting yet, start with it once you figure out most things)
---
As for other currencies like Laurels and Karma, keep it for now. Don't spend your laurels on the fancy rings and accessories that the merchant offers! You'll need "lots" of laurels for crafting recipes in the future
---
It does because certain wings and bosses are exactly an entry level raids because they have 2 mechanics each that can be skipped with certain builds/group compositions, regardless of player skill and effort.
---
Jokes on me. I main Deadeye.
---
Every day we stray further from Dwayna’s light
---
Maybe you should simply accept that the game is not for you and move on?
---
I remember getting that line at the worst (or best?) moment once.
---
me salvaging with copper fed:
---
"NOW I SHALL BREAK YOU."
---
My charr upon receiving the salvaged items in inventory:
---
"And I deserve it, too~"
---
That's kinda the point of raiding and literally any kind of gw2 combat. You learn as you progress through harder content because easy one can be done without thinking about what you're doing. People get spoiled with braindead content and being able to go through it by spamming 1 so every time they see something slightly harder they'll complain about content being too hard. Meanwhile they didn't put even minimal effort into trying it and seeing how hard it really is (and right now half encounters can be considered easy).
---
Fractal tiets teach you nothing about t4/cm difficulty. The only thing you "learn" is the layout of each fractal which you can also see on a youtube video. People still fail core mechanics in t4 because they could just ignore them in earlier tiers.
---
Difficuty tiers don't teach you absolutely anything.
---
Yeah, it's been a long time since I did that event but the zone was overrun with branded over time. It will be interesting if the legendary NPCs come out to help as well. Spaghetti code!
---
GW2 story telling in 2019. Is it about
---
You're missing the point. People who play MMOs expect to have to buy expansions. That's legitmate business. It's different from pay to win.
---
You're trying to take the term pay to win literally but it had a very specific meaning for years and years. You're trying to apply that same meaning today. 
---
The words were intended to deferential between legit MMOs and MMOs that were just there to milk you for money. Where you not only could buy power in the cash shop, but you had to keep spending money in the cash shop in order to remain competitive. That's the original definition.
---
If EVERY MMO is a bit pay to win, then the term loses it's definition...it's original purpose. To distinguish between games that are not legit and games that are.
---
Buying the game to play it for a buy to play game is legit. Sure there's a core game you can play for free. But unless you buy the actual game, you're not going to get the actual features.
---
If you want to see pay to win look at games like Maple Story.  That's to win. Requiring people to actually purchase expansions is buying the game. Not pay to win by any definition I've ever seen.
---
Literal translation of terms don't really hold, if you don't understand the context in which those words were laid out in the first place.
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8 9 10 11 12, DO do do do, 12!

---
Kunnavang was the same type of dragon and she was pretty big. Maybe they didn't have the resources to make a model for Shiny? 
---
Shame they didn't just use the Shimmerwing resources to make a saltspray dragon model and double it as a mount skin.
---
Literally unplayable
---
&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
---
No, I don't. There are some things off, but it just seems like you don't like the game and everything arenanet does will just be added to that list, no matter what.
---
Oh, I know a good use for this!
---
But she never tells me.
---
Where did you get 500g from? I bought everything except a couple foods pretty early on when it was still moderately expensive and I only spent like... 50g?
---
What's the shield-burst method?
---
I can’t place wells/AOE on weak points of dragonfall meta. Annoying af.
---
Others have already given good answers about this case here.  But just FYI if you message me I'm happy to tell people what my transmute skins are.  If I log off, send me mail and I'll get back to you.  I think most people playing Fashion Wars would happily do the same. :)
---
Any chance someone here can explain when the black balls you tether to the pyres spawn and when anomalies spawn? Is it health based or time based?
---
So nothing related to the game being P2W.
---
Take your warclaw back to your SAFE SPACE, LIBERAL!
---
That Meowth is disturbing xD
---
I guess fortnite has a Lore who can fits you.
---
Every time you open your mouth the Snowcrows discord has a post about you. Good lord. 
---
The discord post used to be “stupid people doing stupid things”. Now it’s called “hinawerdan doing stupid things”.
---
Please keep up the content.
---
Don't even know which ones you're missing mate
---
Problem is that you need to turn of borders for *every* item which isn’t a solution either.
---
Yep, it was!
---
It makes me laugh even to this day when I hear that.. like.. bitch no it ain't.
---
Maybe he should stop posting stupid stuff then :/
---
I've always felt like Anet's own standards are killing them. If anything, I expect them to relativize their Living World updates, allowing them to invest more ressources into the rest of the game. Like updating the archaic raid system, polishing existing content, fixing a billion issues that, by adding up, start having a significant impact on player amusement, implement overhauls, and so on, and so forth.
---
But if it break then there will be two stick.  Stick win.
---
I want to get a melee and and ranged mounted attacks, so we can have bosses like [this](https://youtu.be/ZItlC8LIA1o).
---
The attacks could change based on profession, giving you two new slots in the mounts customization panel to choose the skins for your attacks. The attacks would be the same across professions, it'll just change the appearance.
---
Across all characters, I've played for 23,606 hours over 2485 days. You, Sir, are a casual. lol
---
Who doesn't have the money to TP!?
---
A better solution is to have a check-box in the options menu that says: While in combat the option to press F (default) to revive a defeated player is disabled.
---
This way you don't have to feel bad about pressing F to revive someone in a big zerg if there are both downed and defeated players in the same area. This will have the added benefit of defeated players feeling like their defeat is pretty much permanent w/o WPing since less people are able/willing to revive.
---
Your Meowth is utterly terrifying. Great job!
---
Arcdps can do everything, it rejuvenated my sex life with my wife
---
I mean aren’t they considered heels though ? Even if they’re men’s heels ? 
---
I agree though, they are a bit bulky/clunky looking. That’s why I prefer the concept art idea bc it reads more fitting.
---
I saw on a YouTube video, there were 2 people tethered to a pyre? How does this happen? I'm still learning the fight from watching these.
---
Oh fuck my ribs is nice
---
You could try Revenant. Lots of cool animations, good options for both range and melee. Shiro and swords have a lot of mobility.

---
Plains of Ashford has been extremely weird for me today too. I went up to get the vista above the Charr Statue and it ... wasn’t there.
---
Mesmer. It’s never not OP and you can earn $$$ with jp porting as well.
---
it might be worth taking for super short bursty fights like someone else said, in fotms(maybe kc, ca etc.)
---
even there it's debatable at this point and it only works effectively if you precast lich
---
absolutely not worth for longer, "normal" fights
---
This was really adorable and I enjoyed it a lot :D
---
There’s a serious lack of high heel options for heavy in this game tbh. As a girl, I WANT to make my character fight in impractical shoes for the sake of looking hot. But there’s like...three pairs in the whole game.
---
And gasping as if he was really impressed or doing something wrong by keeping it.
---
Next expansion could just be new mounts. I will admit we are very spoiled though. Mounts are really OP for moving around so I pity map creators now that springer/skyscale exist.
---
I had to take my Asura there...norn should get alternate JP paths...
---
No, I remember playing D/D elementalist a while ago...maybe I'll learn how to craft power daggers. :D
---
Stop digging that hole. One of the Anet devs worked with the creator of arcdps to ensure that it complied with their terms and conditions.

---
&gt; I saw the gold to gems exchange, and that worries me a bit.
---
It's actually the best thing for everybody who don't want or just can't spend much money on the game. The excange works in both ways, so you can farm ingame gold, exchange it to gems and buy the gemshop stuff you want. 
---
&gt; Isn't it possible to say, spend $10,000 on gems, exchange all of those gems for a ridiculous amount of gold, and then buy gear that others have spent 2 years to grind and get?
---
It is possible to spend money to the game to get gold, but this won't give you the benefits you may think. 
---
A full exotic gear set can be bought for a few gold. It's the 2nd best equip ingame, but you are able to do everything with it fine. 
---
However, ascended gear, the best one, which is only 6% better, can also obtained relatively quickly. There are several sources to get them. A full set of trinkets can be obtained within a few days for example. 
---
The most benefit from having much gold is to buy many and expensive skins. And that's literally the endgame, gearwise. You don't spend much time/gold to get the best gear, you spend time/gold to get the skins you like the most.
---
Kralkatorrik spawn killing I see

&gt;They probably didn't want to do that so early on

you realise this raid took 9 months to make? they could've easily used the mystical dragon minipet rig

The only one I remember is [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Giant-Kings). If you choose to seek Wolf's blessing you shapeshift and you can communicate with Garm, and while you can understand Eir she can't understand you. If I remember right Norn can shapeshift due to the Spirits of the Wild's blessings, so I think that counts as a legit transformation/reference to it.

watch youtube videos of people using  those overlays..on your phone while struggling to follow in game
---
seems like a much better choice overall than accepting the 10fps loss or whatever
---
sadly most maps don't have picture routes anymore because taco is just superior in every way..kinda like landlines vanished because of mobile phones
---
there is one for winterberry though and maybe others if you dig deep enough
---
Heart of fire lul I leave it to dell/alien ware to fck it up.
---
Go play s/d weaver
---
And here you can see another group got destroyed by Arc dps.
---
Charr but without armor.
---
8 of them
---
Tbf i think the wing had some nice mechanics and the environment vas very cool. It's just that it lacked difficulty imo.
---
Not if you do what the post is saying on thief or distort on chrono; that’s the point
---
Can always remove Warclaw from keybind, has no real use in PvE and is insta selected in WvW.
---
I don't think we'll hear from jormag or primordus for the rest of GW2's life span
---
Silberwastes, world bosses, mastery insights, fractals. Do those.
---
Deleted main cast introduction arc and some armor sets looking like garbage on only 2 non humanoid races are pretty questionable decisions. 
---
New LA looking like a theme park instead of a fortified port city is a bit objective but still a weird choice just like Norns being converted from Norns to tall humans by the writing team.
---
Warclaw while not being questionable by itself had a questionable release time.
---
Skyscale having weird limitation is just anet being afraid of real flying mounts so its a bit questionable but at least their reasoning is somewhat clear.
---
No idea about TP or bounties.
---
You heard "The Friendliest Community" OP. Think some of it is questionable? Get out.
---
Depends if theyre like reverb infusions: which i think they are = no stack
---
Or if theyre like the recent eye glow on skin infusions (like toyshell etc) = they will stack but 2 wont be worth it or noticeable.
---
Eitherway if you have 1, really dont think going for two makes any sense.
---
I think you should re-read the context of the posts, buddy.
---
If they used the mystical dragon rig, they wouldn't be making it a skyscale skin. The line you quoted was about making a second rig for the skyscale animations. Daybroker was talking about using the resources put into the Shimmerwing skin into making a Saltspray Dragon skin, but the Saltsprays are wyverns (4-limbed) and not six-limbed dragons like the Skyscale.
---
If they just wanted to use any old rigging to make the model, and not have it a skyscale skin, then as I said they would have used the wyvern rigging which is closer to saltspray dragons than the mystical dragon, since the mystical dragon is wingless unlike the saltspray dragons.
---
I don't have anything to inject about your build, but the link is broken (missing last parenthesis).
---
Just thought I'd let you know :)
---
Adina and sabir stationary?
---
Don't worry, they remembered asura as high tech plot devices so far into the realm of science fiction that there is no reason anything isn't asura tech nowadays.
---
I don't *want* you to be right, but....
---
If they could make it work, I wouldn't mind a maintenance season - especially if it can make Season 1 playable in one form or another.
---
&gt; updating the archaic raid system
---
Can you elaborate?  I'm not exactly sure what you meant by this.
---
You can take em
---
We ^^or ^^I may or may not have forced someone to disable it during WvW raids with the guild.
---
Yeah i get it. Dunno why I got downvoted just for a suggestion lol.
---
Smart choice
---
you do have to reload the map (e.g. waypoint to another map) for it to work.
---
“Not completely possible in this game”
---
The sort of people who get kicked for that reason aren't the sort of people who take constructive criticism very well anyway
---
Don't you mean all anime? 
---
/s
---
I did that, it doesn't disable it. It doesn't show in the Guild Hall though, but that might always be the case
---
Yus was gonna say on the first raid encounter
---
And floats... because magic is floaty, I guess
---
What weapon do you suggest? Chrono + Greatsword / Sceptre/Pistol?
---
Totally evidence that Anet's working on map changes that screwed up live by accident. We're going to the Blood Legion homelands in season 5. You heard it here first, people.
---
ah, that explains why bunker chrono was not broken at all, you could just oneshot him! or why no one plays memestrel firebrand, let alone imagine the idea to play a scrapper after rework.  
---
no, it was never about the stupid amount of cc which got into the game in terms of pvp. or some cheesy condi builds where you have to outplay hard. or some unkillable druid sustain build. all the super heavy burst builds which just kill you without any chance.  
---
i do not think you are experienced in any field of this game tbh.
---
This was an excellent write-up! It's good to see someone making use of this build, as I love its playstyle and really don't want to switch. 
---
Out of curiosity, what other professions do you play/like?
---
Not sure how you managed to miss the joke completely
---
Because inconsistencies are frustrating. Btw, is the aerodrome ever going to receive a visual update? It's been under construction for years now... Would be nice to not have the whole instance look complete potato at some point.
---
Honestly, I much preferred the Asura in EotN.  Their technology came up more and then, but they weren't the be all and end all solution to every single issue in the game.   Now magic without technology seems incredibly weak and the Asura are required for every single operation.   It's really only humans, together with a ton of Asura tech, that drive the story in GW2.  Which is a shame, since I play mostly norn, and like the Charr and Sylvari best after that.
---
Lol the humor of the video and as always very impressive
---
Since I already have a full set of viper's, do you think it'd be effective to just go farm for the Ascended trinkets and make those trailblazers?
---
What skin is the mini-skirt on Jessie?
---
This is how we did the cm, worked really well.
---
Eye of the North 2.0 please
---
This is like when they fucked up the wurm models before PoF. 
---
I'm actually buying this theory in it's entirety.
---
It's been hard to keep my power down, even switching to full viper's which is what I used to see everyone recommend. I think I'm gonna try farming for the Trailblazer's trinkets to give me a little more sustain, and maybe see if it's my playstyle, more than my build, that makes me wipe so quickly in fights.
---
Because raids reads as difficult content that not everyone tends to do (for more hardcore players) and Alliance raids are not that.
---
Yes! Like, HELLO we play this game too!
---
I'm done with mounts I reckon, got all I need from them. I'd rather they go somewhere new.
---
They can't really improve on the current mounts in the next expac anyway because they are features of PoF, you'd have to make them available in the new expac too which is a bit sketchy.
---
Do you wan't a good build or a build that includes shield? One excludes the other
---
A warmaster in the verdant brink. I just recently did that meta event.
---
He loses control during a battle with a big-ass raptor and you have to fight both at the same time.
---
&gt; If there's a time to be hopeful and confident about the future of the game it's probably now.
---
Games don't always get what they need.  The player-base will get some things that it wants, sure, but will that be enough? 
---
In my opinion? Not so much. That's why my activity as a GW2 player is waning.  I'm not trying to upset you or anything, but I think that the player-base is giving ArenaNet too much credit.  The current in-game activity is what an MMO *should* feel like; having a perceptible decline in activity is bad news for an MMO that relies on a satisfied, active population for monetization. 
---
Right now is what the past year of the game in a successful MMO should have felt like.  It's the source of my skepticism. 
---
My main message and hope is that ArenaNet goes beyond Elona &amp; the Crystal Desert for LS5.  It's time for *something* new environmentally; I think either that's a Norn-focused or Asura-focused living world season or expansion or maybe Cantha.  Either way ArenaNet needs to subvert expectations -- they need to surprise us, and I haven't felt surprised in a while...
---
Whatever that thing in the middle is I'm going to have to say no thank you, a huge no thank you.
---
Eh, I just learned my rotations with a dps meter, learned fights on YouTube, and faked LI till I didn’t have to. This game needs more difficulty options.
---
&gt; Damage reduction stacks very inconsistently, some modifiers stacking additively (reaching very high reduction) while others stack multiplicatively  
---
???
---
You can't know, if you instakick everybody with less than X dps...
---
I didn't like at first, but I think he's redeemed himself in past couple parts of season 4
---
Unless you're planning on allowing raids to be played solo, the hardest part of most encounters is to actually find 10 people interested in it, not the encounter itself lol
---
And yet arc dps was the reason he left the group.
---
I’d be good with just a different icon and prompt. So tired of hitting the prompt thinking I’m saving someone just to figure out they’re full dead and have to stop.
---
Rift repair locations, the area around the way up to the severed wing.
---
Here: \[&amp;BNQLAAA=\] You have a pretty large line of VM from the top of the wing.
---
Also on the south vista from \[&amp;BMsLAAA=\] you have some lines on the mountains.
---
The bridge events of this map also have some extra lines of VM around them.
---
Another good way is doing Rifts with your skyscale.
---
I have no idea what you're quoting. Look, the quality of that conversation has been going straight to the bottom since you decided to tell me that I'm not experienced in any field of the game. I'll leave it at that. Have a nice day.
---
My last comment in this. My personal favorite post that @[hinawerdan](https://www.reddit.com/user/hinawerdan/) has posted so far. Further proving my stance on them being a Toxic Casual. Sums up toxic casual so well.
---
# "No MMO has ever enraged the way GW2 does
---
*Simply by  forcing me to personally git gud. Better at the griffon, better at the  rollerbeetle. Learn to dive and swerve, learn to drift and boost. Learn  to PvP. Learn to dance, once upon a  time when HoT happened. Get better at this, at that. Up your reaction  times, up your feeling for the game mechanics, up your enemy knowledge,  up your animation recognition."*
---
wiki.  
---
and also the fact that you are saying they do not stack multiplaktive...but they do. if they were additive it would break the game basically.  
---
how does math work. ~~
---
I am not spreading any misinformation.  That is you.  Anet has said it is legal, meaning, it is in fact legal.  It's not a grey area.  Stop.
---
2) It really depends on how much effort you want to put into your extra accounts. Here's a sample list of things to do roughly sorted by order of effort:  
---
* Daily log in  
---
* Daily completionist (I personally find pvp the easiest to do)  
---
* Daily crafting time gate  
---
* Daily world bosses and meta events  
---
* Daily fractals
---
* Weekly BL key farm
---
* Weekly Raid clears
---
Yeah, I realize that was said.  Just wanted to add the other side.  Wasn't trying to say you were wrong or anything.
---
You could do that. Remember that this is to solo stuff out in the world. If you want top dmg, full dmg is the way to go
---
you mean this Champ ate all npcs, mobs and even a vista point? that's not good.
---
exactly now you get it.  Even though it is difficult for Anet to change the balls, it doesn't really matter, because that isn't part of the purchasing decision.
---
ICM still exists and ICM still has it - I just borrowed that idea because an extra application for one feature I wanted for myself is a bit much. I've been altering game memory since day zero, there's no way to redirect execution out of the client and into your own code otherwise
---
I had this issue with a 100CM Arkk training group that, for some odd reason, I became a bit attached to and wanted to help. We had a DPS join as a base guardian but they had sufficient AR and it was very clearly training so we thought we would let it slide.
---
They then proceeded to do 3k to 4k dps, did no mechanics and then asked if they might perhaps be better off running Dragonhunter they insisted their build was fine as they were also doing all the needed healing, boons and CC that the group needed and they were specialised for all of that and "good damage". Subsequently, they got very bitchy that they were carrying the group and that without them we would wipe worse. 
---
After they were kicked, Arkk died on the next pull. MMOs can have a real mix of players but Guild Wars 2 seems quite special for a lack of critical thinking, the Dunning-Kruger effect and accusing others of toxicity if you just happen to be dragging groups down.
---
Wait a few more days
---
Then make the metric the type of players that tend to run the game mode. If it caters more to hardcore players then it's a raid, if it doesn't then it's not.
---
They saw the level 80s move in and said "Fuck this" and moved a map over
---
yea but now Kralk is dead, who is doing the branding?
---
To be frank I do not even know reason to have at this day and age thoroughness trait. (But still play minstel FB and usually insta pop if comm or I misstep into bomb)
---
It do not protect you from condi damage, it do not protect you from power damage... it is just a number.
---
You forgot the 9k Phase smash too
---
This would be great. I go to Observatory for fractals and the Divinity's reach one for everything else.
---
Play however you like. Ignore/report the haters
---
That's true, I guess they could reskin it as an awakened event, you get downed, pop back up as awakened and can infect other players.
---
I saw you type thief...did you perhaps mean decap bot?
---
This shape shift isn't the traditional norn shape-shift though, you had to get a blessing from Wolf to do it. There is a mention of it in the norn personal story though, I forget if all three options show this or only one, but at one point Eir shifts into a wolf to fight and test your abilities.
---
Must be nice to live under a rock.
---
is there anything in the cash shop worth buying?
---
Those epeens look so errect.
---
That's awesome do you have a unique work situation that allows you more free time?
---
Being a decap bot is fun because your main job is still +1ing tho
---
They exist, at least on EU. If you can't find a single one? Start it yourself.
---
Right now, I'm basically using the account for daily login and then farming luminous dusts (currently over 11s each) while I do things on my main account.  Its seems to be a few extra gold here and there, already a few hundred total, but I've been wondering if there was something more I could do that doesn't take much time.  PvP dailies sounds like a good idea.  Thanks.
---
[This.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Courage)
---
That's not the case in any of my builds. No, the problem is what I described and I'm not the only one. First I though it it's my issue ofc, but you can read about the same issues in other threads on reddit and on the official forum. Mostly in threads where ppl ask for official build templates. Somebody brings the "we already have arcdps" argument and there you go. :)
---
"+1" is not a role...no matter how many times people try to say it is.
---
Even if you wanted to pretend it is, other classes do it better than your joke class.
---
Please help me out, what is going on with this? Is it a sequential pattern?
---
Like u/ExsOhs said , just practise your rotation , there are plenty of guides , specially on the snowcrows website with all the hints to pull out good DPS , learn the mechanics, there are plenty of youtube guides for raids bosse . 
---
and then go ahead don't join directly , just whisper the comm ans dsaid you know mechs, but don't have KP yet , you'd be surprised how much are willing to help new people as long as you put good will in it . 
---
And i did exactly  that same as u/ExsOhs  it all started with a successfull training kill of VG , then a join or gorseval on a group that was managed by one of the Quantify leader that lead our poor quality group to the kill .
---
so yeah a bit of patience at start but after few months you'll be able to complete your full run on reset day .
---
Maybe it's not a role (I doubt that but still), but it is definitively easier to do while you roam to control the map.
---
Ah, and over time people stopped mentioning the loss of loot and just start telling people to wp...
---
It wasn't so much that he had lost control of his shapeshifting as he was being driven berserk by fear.
---
If that wasn't a reference to a specific story/movie then it was probably supposed to be some kind of light hearted mini-story based on Apocalypse Now!, Platoon or other Vietnam war movies/stories.  If they wanted light hearted there were better scenes/situations to choose from in both movies, and if they wanted dark then they seriouisly underplayed it... Either way it could have been done better.
---
You miss-spelled "30k unblockable longbow 2".
---
The game's weirdly buggy today. I was in Dragonfall and saw mobs from the Melandru area in the burning forest. They didn't attack, they just ran off.
---
Not really ... I was slacking off on doing them on my alt account. Thought it was going to take a while. I am on the verge of ending up with two extras now, just need to kill cobalt wurm and finish PS. This is without LS2. With LS2 it would be a breeze.
---
Exactly. Also renegade spirits are bugging atm. So maybeeee they do a rework, too.
---
I've added a few more to the list.
---
https://youtu.be/R9U_WObvNko

This one is pretty recent.

I'm surprised that no one mentioned aoe blinds. Though it was mostly only used in old pug groups.

Covers fractal skips pretty thoroughly.
---
Lonai was the only awakened who could awaken others and we left her in space.
---
What exactly is bugging? Have played renegade in Fracs the last couple. Of days and have not seen any issues
---
I'm hoping for greater norn lore and updated hairstyles/tattoos for them as well.
---
My first character was a norn because I loved them in gw Eotn and they're nothing, *NOTHING* like them. That kind of.. broke my heart a little? Norn in gw2, really have no unique qualities, no lore or anything that sets them apart from other races other than being big and tattooed.
---
I'm still almost impressed the entire Kralk arc managed to never do anything Char related.
---
Happened to me a while ago but I was on the flip side XD I was a DD who did less damage than support but group was too nice to kick me T-T I felt so bad man
---
That Meowth
---
As if that is a loss lol

Context: On June 14, 2019, I was helping a guild member with crafting so that they could craft ascended armor and participate in T4 fractals. While we were working on crafting, I mentioned that I needed some upgrade extractors to recover my scholar runes from my valkyrie reaper build so I could stat swap it to berserker stats. They mentioned that there is an unlimited upgrade extractor. I looked it up on the trading post and noticed the high price which dissuaded me from pursuing it.
---
A few minutes later while working on crafting, I remembered that I could find upgrade extractors from black lion chests. I decided to check the price of keys, and they happened to be on a discount (almost half-price for the 25 key bundle if I remember correctly). I purchased gems, and bought the 25 keys and started opening chests, hoping to get at least 4 upgrade extractors along with some wardrobe unlocks and other miscellaneous items. While I was nearing the end of my 25 keys, I stumbled upon the Endless Upgrade Extractor Contract. I was in voice chat with my guild member, and burst out laughing while telling them to look in chat as I linked the item. We were both in disbelief, especially over the fact that we were just talking about it minutes before. It felt like some sort of Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.
---
I wanted to make this post so I remember the moments before and after obtaining my luckiest video game drop ever. I’ve been playing for 4,088 hours since September 2, 2012, and the rarest thing I’ve ever looted was the Lightward’s Battle Staff. I’ve never even had a precursor drop. I don’t know what to do with the extractor, at this point I have already stat swapped my gear after extracting what I could with the single-use extractors. I promised myself I’d take a week before making a decision, but I am leaning towards keeping it and using it, especially to remind me of this amazing moment.
---
After writing this, I realized that I could have bought a much smaller quantity of gems and converted them to gold to recoup the cost of the scholar’s runes I wanted to reuse. However, I am glad I made this decision. It certainly brought a big smile to my face.
---
Fun fact - Necromancers can wield a focus.
---
Braham is great. I don't know why you got a hair across your ass over him.
---
Generally LFG is much more active on EU
---
Isn't that your own fault for running around without a stunbreak?
---
And I do the same to anybody I see downed. It's called playing the game together you piece of shit.
---
Yep, suddenly you move across the map
---
You quite some patches outdated   :)
---
Rifle warrior has a place, its called deepstone. You can run like a chicken every time he ports around, or you can swap rifle while running and get that sweet sweet 100 or whatever DPS.
---
Focus on necro is such a shame. The 4 is a very generic move, it isnt "bad", it just doesnt do anything special and doesnt mix with any spec. The 5 is good in theory (maybe in PvP or something), but its a 2 second cast for mediocre damage unless they have boons, and "meh" DPS if they have 3 boons. Was a big let down when they stated they were re-working necro focus, especially given how well they reworked the guardian focus, and then they just basically swapped one ability that wasnt used for another one that isnt used.
---
ah yes, the old "everything should be PvE" rant.  Wah wah
---
Its a random wing, but loot is tied to portals, not raids themselves.
---
Raid fullclear w2 already rolled!
---
Eh, its not so much guardian longbow, its ranged weapons in PvE in general. Most have straight lower DPS due to the fact that they are ranged. But in PvE, ranged doesnt even provide a benefit--perhaps even a detriment since you often need to stay close for boons/mechanics.
---
Necro focus is a meta option in WvW. Warrior rifle also a place in some meme builds; Not really efficient but quite funny at what it does.
---
Now we know the true raison d'être of Asuras. Even Taimi and Gorrik would lose all their rationality if they'd see it.
---
[I've had more problems with Soulbeasts tbh](https://prntscr.com/o2a96o)
---
yes as far as i know marauder gives more stats(all types with more than 3 stats usually do)..but the main issue with soldier gear is that it has no precision and no ferocity which are huge damage losses
---
it used to be popular ages ago for bunker builds but minstrel is simply better for that and yea, power dps wanting some defense almost always goes marauder
---
also there is an argument to be made about the benefits of toughness vs vitality..you need lots of toughness to get a decent damage reduction going but every bit of vitality helps(it turns a 1 shot into barely surviving it for example)
---
dunno about condi though, it's never used in zergs because of removal/resistance spam..and even in roaming most people slot in defense against conditions usually including food
---
i've heard of people using plaguedoctor and trailblazer in wvw but dunno how/if they're good or not so i can't really help in that regard
---
do keep in mind though, almost all roaming builds are variations on power gear for various reasons..
---
/r/TIHI
---
You're a real internet champion. Congrats.. why don't you add your downvote to my groggy morning post to prove how intelligent you are.
---
I meant you ruining it by being a negative. Lol It's very apparent you cannot read into the context of anything at all.
---
I have also seen this form of issue when CSS could not be loaded or even JavaScript execution was blocked.
---
&gt; Lol It's very apparent you cannot read into the context of anything at all.
---
Like the context for example of "Every race says this, why present it as if only sylvari do?"
---
Wing 1/2/3 Late-night NA is up to 300 minimum now. And you can only find those on Mondays or Fridays.
---
&gt;My main message and hope hope is that ArenaNet goes beyond Elona &amp; the Crystal Desert for LS5.
---
Well, we did just go to Thunderhead Peaks and...
---
*checks notes*
---
...An island made partly from the still-living body of an elder dragon and partly from pieces of the gods' realms that it tore from the Mists when it fell from a rift in the sky.
---
From a PvE perspective its pretty useless, and in PvP it's best used as part of a hybrid build if you want to run both mace and sword. It is likely best in WvW as it is solid in duels against certain classes and your damage is high enough that you could drop a little damage for the defense.
---
I still hope the new God of War has inspired some people at Anet to revisit Norn some day. That game basically nailed the whole aesthetic and feel I wanna see with Norn. 
---
Right now it's just underwhelming what anet did to them, especially in terms of dumbing them down. They're supposed to be wise and spiritual.
---
It’s not even hard to get, there are so many easy dailies that don’t even require enemy contact... just plan ahead and you get the gift almost at an instant as soon as you have everything else.
---
Toughness is the most useless stat in the game
---
Change my mind
---
As a WvW'er (though I imagine the sentiment is shared by all who dont PvE), it just sucks that you need **a fuckton of PvE exclusive materials** and the only way to do it is to slog through the generally broken/forgetten system of dungeons for at minimum (with all boosters) 5-ish hours. This is especially true for stuff like raid specific gear (armor/rings), **which are not even available outside PvE**, but also general weapon legendaries. Its not even the timegate of having to take 5 hours to do something, its that you have to PvE, which is a terrible experience (to all but a minority in the game). Hope subsequent legendaries get alternatives to the gift, akin to PoF gift being interchangeable with HoT gift.
---
/rantover
---
All of the lore-based traits that really set the Norn apart were removed or nerfed in the name of game balance:  
---
Norn are, by lore, supposed to be physically powerful enough that combat magic wouldn't even be necessary... Lifting and huring huge boulders and such.  This in the player's hands would actually completely equalize game balance and I can only image Anet would be mad that their chosen children classes could be bested by any Norn at any time. (Race as a fashion)  
---
With that kind of physical strength, and their height (which was also nerfed) they would be capable of running as fast as any current mount without breaking a sweat.  Again with the "race is supposed to be a fashion" policy.  
---
The Norn's lore-based more independent lifestyle had to be thrown aside for the player character to bring us into the Pact, though this one is somewhat forgivable because in many ways we're doing a similar thing to Svanir and his cult we now fight all the time... Looking for alternative methods of augmenting our strength with which to grow our legend.  The semi-nomadic and/or hunting lodge type of culture is further alienated by game mechanics because of map design.  The lodges are out in the middle of nowhere and it should take days/weeks to travel between them, not minutes.  This is a function design breaking the immersion thing (AKA It doesn't smell right).  
---
How would the Norn culture progress any story they're involved in?  They would start with knowledge of a treasure and/or foe to fell or a curiosity about something they haven't been able to get into themselves.  They would then go to a gathering place of other Norn and start asking around for info or gathering a party to go fight their way in.  They would gain knowledge/power though treasures they get, spirits they meet/converse with in these "dungeons" or during vision quest types of things they do with their shamans.  
---
Sound familiar?  The Asura and Priory do all this off camera for us these days, and have since the end of LS2 really; At best we get to see the very end of these story processes.  The closest we really got to any of this in recent memory was during the story missions in Bitterfrost Frontier where we had to ask around and "quest" around a little to get into the Bitter Cold.  This is the way Norn do things.  And then we saw only the very end of another "Norn-way" story that had every bad character building decision possible attached it...  So the community hated the story and Anet (even more than usual) for it.  
---
Not withstanding that there really isn't anything particularly magical or special about the above way of doing things...  The most unique to the Norn thing above is using Shamanic vision quest types of rituals for knowledge gathering and proofs of strength.  Proving yourself repeatedly is not special and why have vision quests or guided adventures in the Mists when we have older races like Dwarves and Forgotten with tech that can be studied by our own personal know-it-all krewe... Assuming it wasn't something already built by the Asura themselves.  Remember when the Pale Tree was part of the story and we didn't need tech for that kind of thing?  Better times.  Oh wait, that's a Sylvari thing that also does the shamanic ritual stuff.  
---
And finally, what could ever possibly be more funny than 6 years of never ending gigantic stupid muscle bound teddy bears with ptsd jokes, right?  
---
It isn't that every Norn you run across is suffering this, it's that so many of the Norn NPCs you interact with as part of frequent events or in the story instances seem to be designed trying to make this gag.  I can't say that I've noticed any non-enemy Charr, Asura, Sylvari or human NPC being used to push this kind of crap, it's something Anet reserves specifically for Norn.  Going back to the muscle being a replacement for magic, the Norn are hunters by racial idiom and to be a successful hunter requires the same level of intelligence as any book-smarts subject.  It's just applying it differently and letting the strength make up for the rest.  It should be noted that the Asura do this exact thing in reverse.  
---
If the Norn were as stupid racially as just about every one of them you run across after all but the earliest of zones and story missions, then the race would be extinct.  The best cluster of examples of Norn NPCs demonstrating what they are really supposed to be can be found in the southern area of the Wayfarer Foothills, where their schemes are either straight forward or clever.  
---
Something else to keep in mind, there are a lot of seemingly whimsical things Norn do, like instead of being mad at his lodge getting attacked by Ice Wurms, that particular guy starts talking about having a song written about it.  This isn't stupidity/insanity at work, as it would very well be if a human were doing it, this is the Norn cultural way of handling fear and growing legends.  Norn recognize they're going to die at some point, and only a rememberable story about them is going to keep that part of them alive long after they are gone.  Fear is a part of their way of life, but even in our mundane IRL world, you get some amount of say in how it affects you... But it's a learned response.  The Norn write and sing tales about great exploits as a means of teaching and reenforcing how one should act in dire circumstances.  
---
"Oh you almost died? HELL YEA! LET'S GET DRUNK AND SING ABOUT IT!"  
---
The idea cultually is to build a mindset where they don't fear the emotion and physical states of fear, but rather embrace it and see it as something even possibly good... Or at least as a part of the excitement.  And in doing so they also perpetuate and reenforce their cultural values in positive ways at the same time, making it desirable and more rewarding to go forth and perform or join in on various feats at the individual level too.  
---
This does come with a dark side in that people who feel that their legend is or has become an eternal memory of their failures can be driven to very dark places, very quickly, e.g. Eir in the Honor of the Waves.  I'm sure charity does exist in Norn culture but they also don't strike me as the kind to bend over backwards, or throw shame on someone who doesn't, for another who will not help themselves.  
---
That is the culture that rings most deeply in me personally, and the real reason I play Norn... We just never get to see any of it because the it doesn't make sense in the story right now, some other race got tapped to perform the thing even if the story could permit it, we arrive and only see the very end, or just because it's easier to make fun of muscular individuals having mental breakdowns after watching their brethren die.  
---
After watching them dismantle everything Norn and then mishandle the race in the story for nearly 7 years now, I'm not sure I want to see what fuckery would come of them trying now. -.-
---
Stack scourges and the boss is a snooze fest. All you need to know is that there are orbs that need to be caught and brought to the pylons. Orbs fall on specific places and belong to specific pylons. You have 3 kiters and 1 healer. The kiters should be able to heal themselves, main healer can help when needed. Thats mainly it regarding the orbs.
---
That's in 2018, before NCSoft dropped the hammer and told them in no uncertain terms to focus on GW2's profitability. Expansions are the game's highest profit drivers, so we'll be getting more of them.
---
it was great tbh
---
Both windowed and windowed fullscreen mode have worse performance that fullscreen.
---
GZ one of the worst and unfair ever.
---
100% with you on that. Joko especially. I still feel like he was wasted and I can't seem to let go of that for some reason. Part of me wants to believe that Joko getting eaten by Aurene was part of the plan and that he's going to manifest himself out of her somehow.
---
Jormag should have been the villain of the first expansion, but then Scarlet happened and she screwed everything.
---
Welcome to the jungle.
---
Hm, yeah I suppose they do all require a blessing. It's just I've done this story a lot and I remember this one was a different type of blessing. We had to go kill a corrupted wolf first to gain the blessing of wolf. When you are transformed it is a standard wolf model and not the bipedal one the norn typically has. I think it's ghostly too.
---
I miss a decent norn character who is all about honor and stuff like that. Braham really ruins the race's mood, being a young guy.
---
Forgal was norn at its purest, we need that back, so Braham better mature up quick.
---
Hehe, I really like this map. I personally like this more than the PoF maps.
---
I am starting to get why the gods left us...
---
We've got fun and games.
---
why? it's not that hard or expensive and after the nerf it's now 3 days instead of 8
---
*Laughs in Springer*
---
Meeeee -cries- I do  little bit every few days because the stupid currency collection is mindnumbingly horrid. And I'm out of karma....
---
The glass cannon air ele sounds fun, especially since I could probably throw together a power build pretty quickly and easily (man they make vipers so annoying). 
---
I def wouldn't mind a write-up, and I'll probably check out your stream too.
---
Well depending if you have 250 of each map currency or not, and if not, if you have enough karma.
---
Both of which I lack. My fault obviously but still that's one example of how not everyone else can finish it quickly like you have.
---
pvp nerfs
---
After all the work anet has put into mounts? Not likely.
---
I bet Belgian politicians regret their decisions now
---
The people who arent mounted up while waiting for events
---
Just got mine yesterday, I did the collections rather slowly. Some of that stupid crap really hurt, especially the first steps and the JP part.
---
i always thought it meant power precision toughness coming from a pve player
---
You know you could do something else besides ping my phone with notifications.  You've already made yourself look like a total jackass, so please leave me alone.
---
As a frugal gamer I hate gambling mechanics, but as a libertarian-leaning individual I hate government telling me what I can and cannot buy.
---
Decisions, decisions...
---
by doing reward tracks for these maps when they came out, i think op should have more than enough
---
I'm not sure if for lore reasons or gameplay, but it's true that they used a different wolf model. You're probably right, that could very well be a another form of shapeshifting - even if it still requires a blessing like the other one.
---
&gt;And here you can see another group got destroyed by Arc dps.
---
I don't understand when you said "Don't twist my words". Your word choices such as "And here", "another", "destroyed" and the passive voice clearly indicate you feel a sense of discomfort with ArcDps. By putting your sentence that way, it seems clear to me that in your opinion, ArcDps is the problem that destroys groups. If you want to talk about ArcDps as a reason, you should say something more neutral like "player leaves group because of ArcDps", which is a true statement in this case though not the underlying cause. And I would have replied "1+1=2", which is also a true statement. 
---
When everyone was talking about the leeching behavior, you instead talk about how ArcDps destroys groups. The underlying reason that the player quits is that his leeching behavior, which was contrary to his own belief that he is good, was exposed. Even without ArcDps, it only takes a little bit of raid awareness to know this person is not carrying his own weight. Plus, instead of blaming the Addon, I suggest you to file a complaint to ArenaNet about their decision on allowing some of those combat event API that makes tracking combat log on runtime plausible.
---
FUCKING PREACH IT!!
---
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
---
As great as Dragonfall was for previous masteries, the exploration part without many other collections besides Skyscale and Blooming Armour has me to agree. Kinda is rather boring, but I imagine the thinking was since it’s the finale to the season, everything should focus on this boss and his impacts.
---
NORN FOR LIFE
---
Or they’re trying to save their frame rate lol
---
Speaking of Norn, is anyone else annoyed that they aren't immune to Chilled? Norn aren't supposed to be sensitive to the cold, they run around the arctic half naked!
---
I actually felt that Joko stayed just short enough that we loved him and just long enough to not feel like he was overstaying his welcome
---
Well adding a spvp reward track that also rewards a gift of battle might be possible.
---
this is a long-winded reply but maybe you'll get where i'm coming from with it.
---
i'm not a wvw player by any means, I MAYBE roam from time to time, but I make a lot of legendaries so that means a lot of gift of battle reward track grinds. you should just treat working towards the skyscale as a reward track in itself. 
---
if i'm being completely honest, i do not like wvw in it's current state at all (that's a whole other topic), the reward tracks feel like they take forever and i'm in it for the GoB and my time having fun in wvw is maybe 30% of it. BUT the same way the reward track seems to tick ever-so-slowly for me, i still know that i'm that much closer to getting what i want. 
---
all that being said, sometimes i just wanna go balls-to-the-wall and grind it out crazily (which burns me out but i recover quickly) 
---
just look up things you need for it and slowly chip away at it &amp; do whatever it is YOU know makes you enjoy your time in-game.
---
Actually they were blocked by then but I don't even know what the point of this conversation is anymore. So nice to meet you and bye.
---
I haven’t gotten it because I waited for SO to be done with school for the quarter to finish story. We just finished it last night
---
spamming stuff 1 while wearing full toughness, healing power, and concentration as daredevil with no rune or sigils on weapon while dead half of the time. Note that this is also with quickness and likely 25 might/fury.
---
Watch out for Pocket raptors... :&lt;
---
Is that Dickings Per Second?
---
The olmakhan were a nice focus on Charr. They weren’t the Black Citadel but they were an interesting perspective. Still, what I want to know is how will the Black Citadel react to them? See them as traitors? Force them to conscript? Slowly “educate” them à la residential schools (look it up, horrible thing)?  Or maybe some Charr will flee to try and live with the olmakhan, where they can free from persecution. Who knows
---
Gift of Battle has been a requirement for generation one legendaries since day one quit being a weenie
---
Did Balthazar worshipers get anything special during the campaign of PoF?
---
There’s a drunk norn shapeshifted to bear in the Garden of Seborhin (Domain of Vabbi), near The Menagerie. An Elonian merchant trapped him in a cage and wants to sell him. He even tells you to ignore it if the ‘bear’ talks to you
---
Sounds like the norn can’t shapeshift back for some reason
---
Necro focus 5 is pretty good, but only if your target has enough boons to rip. Focus 4 is a joke its slow and deals such low damage it hardly makes a dent in someone HP.
---
What they should, taking account of the nerf to the loot, is make one random wing with extra loot if doing in CM, like the mechanic of Call of the Mists.
---
Yeah, I honestly miss it. I'd run one of my alts around on drunken ktrain night and see if I'd get lucky and get a BL Key from the completion rewards. Really wish they would have at least kept the rewards it even if it didn't count for World Completion. :/
---
If you want proper quests you're in the wrong game.
---
Nice try Anet :^)
---
I will take collections over traditional quests any day, mostly because collections are not our base level open world content, events are. If collections were literally all we had to do in the open world, you might have a point.
---
&gt;give me pve world completion through wvw and we can talk.
---
It was the worst. Not so much the fact that you had to go into a different gamemode, but that it was the exact same fucking map three times. Nevermind the waiting until your server was in the right starting position to finish that last stupid POI or Vista.
---
I am very much in favor of removing the gambling involved in the Black Lion Chests. There are items that you simply cannot acquire in game unless you gamble for a chance to drop them.
---
It is foolish to believe that a system which locks items behind gambling is better than a system that allows direct purchases.
---
That reminds me, after one of the metas you can actually do this to a champion hydra on the ice flow in Thunderhead Keep
---
AFAIK, Belgium didn't directly limit what their people could buy, they put the limit on how a company can sell in their region (The ban is directed at companies using lootboxes).  
---
In fact, it's Anet's (More likely NCSoft's) gem store people who have declared all of that content unavailable to Belgian citizens and those of any other country who has passed similar legislation.  This is ofc to pressure/punish people in those regions to push them to get their governments to lift the laws.  
---
This 1980s movie plot crap from the COMPUTER GAMING INDUSTRY... Not even from something like pharma, oil or other typical media targets.  I can't even.
---
Necro warhorn got absolutely gutted. Its use is to give swiftness only now. It will take some time for people to realize that its the worst weapon ingame rn.
---
And now all your luck is used up. Try not to gamble in the next year alrighty? Haha
---
Tbh if you have 3,5k armor with protection, yes, anyone should hit you like a wet noodle, because you also hit like a wet noodle.
---
Oh! Good to know, I finished that one a while ago
---
Even in condi builds even though Scepter does no condi dmg lmao.
---
Loot boxes are a perfect example of why I stepped back from Libertarian ideals. The free market does indeed breed innovation. However, when that innovation come in the form of a realization that the human mind can be manipulated through gambling adjacent techniques, it starts to look a bit muddier. Things get much worse when you realize that without regulation, usage of those techniques turns into a race to the bottom where competitors who don't use them quickly fall away. And here we are in 2019, with a gaming market pretty much completely saturated with them.
---
Ah, hot maps... fun times, especially before the nerf. It was a lot harder then. Still, even now, its still  a challenge
---
The keys and the items put into the BL chests are a way to sell things without afixing a real price to them.  The only gamble is how much money will have to be poured in before the shiny thing lands in my inventory.  
---
And there are legal games for days just to reach  the point where they keys themselves get purchased.
---
They didn't have anything to do with the Kralk plot though. They basically only exist as characters for 1-2 episodes dealing with Joko then its just generic background forces.
---
Plus like, while I do like the Olmakhan as their own thing, it doesn't really fulfill doing anything with any of the Char plot that exists. They are completely removed from everything about the Char .
---
Basically I just find it funny that despite having such a long thorough arc based on defeating Kralkatorrik, we never touched the whole Charr area. The place and in turn race originally associated with him more than any of the others. Not to imply the Norn haven't also gotten the short end of the stick. but even they've seen plot development with Jormag and a new map around that in season 3. We've still never gotten a single Char/Ascalon map since launch.
---
Why not? Collections are a bare minimum of a quests. Reused events, pressing F on random locations and occasional dialogue all combined in UI. Imagine how much better knight of the thorn collection could be if it had a proper quest structure and less collecting.
---
Japan has an interesting regulation when it comes gacha. After spending x amount of money you get to choose what you want from the prize pool. I'd spend a lot just for an infinite hairstylist...
---
I only remember [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/From_the_Ashes).
---
&gt; **&lt;Character name&gt;:** *It IS you...from the vision. Your fight isn't over. Not yet.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Deadeye Priestess:** *What are you talking about?*  
---
&gt;*If playing as a human and selected Balthazar at character creation*  
---
&gt;**&lt;Character name&gt;:** *I prayed to Balthazar, too. I know how it feels to have your faith crumble inside you.*
---
Braham is...complicated.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I like the premise of his character. I’m a writer, and a pretty darn good one at that, and having a character with his kind of agency, loyalty, and thought was super inspiring. But that sorta changed after HoT. Eir’s death just kinda turns him into...an ass. Let’s not sugarcoat it.
---
The biggest issue is that he makes her death all about him, as if he’s the only one who knew her, thought of her, had mind for her wishes, etc. Which is totally shortsighted and wrong - Rytlock, Caithe, even the player character in some instances knew Eir better than he did. That’s simple fact. Yes, she was his mom, but they weren’t close. They were only beginning to mend the rift in their relationship, which up until then was strained and awkward.
---
Braham’s actions, as a result of his thoughts, are pretty out of line. He took her bow as his own and used it to break the fang (which I have...feelings about), he took her companion, and he claims to be the only one who wants to preserve her legacy because he’s her only son. And when you say anything against him, he accuses you of soiling her memory and that “Eir wouldn’t want you in Destiny’s Edge anyway”, which...I mean, come on.
---
It gets even WORSE when he breaks the fang and makes his OWN DE, which is TRULY not something Eir would’ve wanted, given that her guild was a meeting of the races and had so many more goals than his guild does. He only names it after hers in an effort to meet her legend, which, no, it does not. It falls apart when Jormag goes to sleep - a possibility he knew about with Taimi’s work. Essentially his work with his DE did nothing. He comes back in LW4 with a better attitude, but it still takes Eir coming back to get him to chill the eff out.
---
Are his actions justified? That’s the real question we’re asking when it comes to Braham. Are his actions following his mother’s death in line with his character? Maybe, which makes him a great character. But are they justified in the faces of the other characters and how he responds to their grief? Absolutely not. He has no right to act in the way he does, grief or no. However you want to argue it - and there’s a lot of ways to, mental illness and/or grief included - nothing justifies acting like a dick to your friends. And nothing justifies ignoring their pain in lieu of his own.
---
Anyways, sorry to hijack, but I feel like the Braham thing is more complicated than “getting a hair across your ass”. His character has a lot of depth and action, for sure - but it raises questions (as it should) about his moral standing. Which is part of what makes him a good character whether you love him or hate him.
---
...also hi, new to the community, run for your lives.
---
I don't have it yet. I didn't mind the timegate or collection, I just hate grinding that map currency so I didn't do it. Also it ripped my motivation to play GW2 altogether since I don't really have any other content I'd like to play. Hope that something interesting comes to the game soon, maybe I'll find some motivation to get the mount then.
---
This kind of makes you seem like an arsehole - even if you were in the right the way you went about it was just terrible for getting what you wanted.
---
Tough one.  It is a convenient item if you dont have legendary gear. But once you have that it loses its purpose other than gold-generation... but I'm not sure if its easy to recoup the 2000g.
---
Fighting that thing is nightmarish, especially with above average ping. I'll get two shot for standing in the fire it spreads with little warning on top of the flames being really hard to see for some reason
---
It would be nice to have something between main story quests and open world events though.  Other than running around pressing F.
---
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
---
Orbs lie around on the bottom on playable area. No specific location AFAIK. They are a little hard to see but doable.
---
Thief dps is for sure easier than mesmer. I would have to say the same is true for pvp and wvw as well.
---
You are mistaken, Kohler will still spin when ppl are in melee range and the gravelings will use the burrow attack at any range. The benefit to stacking and pulling around line of sight (LOS) is to get everyone in one spot so its easier to and everyone in range of buffs/boon/stance shares w/e  with LOS pulls the mobs melee and range have to run around the corner (because they cant see you to target you) and thus stack themselves up without the party needing to use skills to stack them. Bonus if you use fears and knockbacks or w/e and the mobs are up against a wall that means they stay in the AOEs instead of getting knocked out of the fresh DH traps or w/e. For the gravelings after the spider queen the champ will almost always (always if you pull with enough range) use the burrow attack to close the distance and then run around the corner, since everything is running around a corner into your aoes and everyone is in the same spot shit dies real fast. If say your grp doesnt have the dps to killthe champ fast enough the burrow attack will come off CD and it will burrow at point blank range, the more things this attack hits the more it evades so not getting hit by this attack speeds up the kill tremendously, if you dont it will always have evade frames when it hits things.
---
So something post PoF campaign? At least it’s something I guess but man I really wish they brought some meaning into our choices.
---
just on greatsword somehow
---
Well everytime you use the mystic forge or kill a mob hoping for a precursor, you're gambling.  Stop being delusional.
---
We really don't know.
---
I bet the wvw servers are just over capacity with all the players that started with warclaw.
---
Now they just have to get rid of players by forcing germans and french to use the same teamspeak.
---
If you run that kind of build as pdps you have to be completely trash and the game should be deleted together with his PC burned... 
---
But true it would be possible this way
---
Bonus points if they are princess dolls so you just die by pressing 1 thanks to the confusion.
---
gw2 isn't dying, don't fall for the hysteria.
---
the layoffs were due to side projects anet was working on, not gw2
---
honestly, quite impressive because this is t4 so it's likely full ascended
---
I appreciate that you're the only one going with my joke
---
Me, but that's because I can't be assed to grind map currency when Shadowbringers drops in 13 days or so.
---
Well maybe and just super maybe he doesn't know about changing ascender gear to the right stats... But gosh must he been carried hard all the time beforehand for that
---
because the ppl that don't have an issue with the acquisition methods of certain rewards are just enjoying their rewards
---
The same bear-norn actually be found in the rata sum prison. They were continuing the old joke.
---
This is going to be a mess. French and German realms are very much speaking only their language for WvW.
---
I think it's current state of all "gamers". We live in era of mobile games where people "play" with their wallets and barely even do anything  since those games literally play themselves.
---
Here you have like minded people who want everything for free because they already paid for content or shinies that are introduced.
---
Yeah, that was my impression based on the VoDs that I watched glad to know that there really isn't anything more to it! Thanks.
---
Will have my popcorn ready for that relink.
---
Which is why it's a test. 
---
&gt;" This will help us create fairer links and gather data on the impact of grouping together players who speak different languages. "
---
Easily the worst thing about guard is that a trash weapon loke scepter is their best weapon.
---
This is going to be huge mess when lot of worlds has gotten used to yelling ^(profanities) in their own language.
---
I get why it might be needed, but I dont really see this as good thing in EU. Specially with TS/Discord voicechats.
---
Not gonna be a fan
---
Who wouldn't want to be linked with glorious french servers?
---
How dare you ask people to read what was written you horrible person don't you know this community skims posts then complains. (I'm being sarcastic).
---
Community part
---
I've done that a couple times too.
---
so you either have shit links and matchups or better ones with maybe having to default to english so you can all understand eachother
---
Remove random loot shit which is only aquireable throught random loot chests. Plus one to Belgium.
---
Hi there. So I didn't gild you, but I do want you to know that I love you.
---
Congrats. You are a certified soft vegetable.
---
You didn't only defend online gambling, but also did it with the dumbest argument possible.
---
This 'everything will be more expensive' argument is so forced.
---
If something is priced too high, people will simply not purchase it. And if people don't purchase it, they either have to make it be worth the high amount, or the prices will end up going down.
---
That comment make me wonder if you are playing on EU at all or realize how complicated this will be. If you are linked to a national server were they speak their language in TS/Discord and you don't understand a single thing they say. I mean imagine Vabbi or AG being linked with BB. I laugh hysterically inside of the thought but because it is hilarious but reality is that it will break both host and link and create far more issues the it will fix something.
---
The national server do many times play WvW differently then the not national servers. And the itch it will create between the two is just another thing that will hurt WvW.
---
youl find the most accessible ones in jahai, especially with the long chain that floats above, and thunderhead peak in the main portion leading to the forge, when you first enter it and head down to the left, once u get out of that tunnel. south in thunderhead there are paths on the water that the skimmer is perfect for. Dragonfall had the most magic for me in the areas around the initial skyscale nest, i found some really good short chains close together that i could just follow, and back in jahai the fortress of jahai is fun to fly around collecting the magics on top. 
---
BUT BE WARNED. there is a daily cap, so in reality you would only be able to maybe get all of the magic from one map. but since we usually pick up main portions here and there it feels like we collect alot across maps but in total its only one maps worth of VM, then u gotta wait for reset and it all comes back.
---
Do the rifts. There's plethora of magic along their routes.
---
Sure, I generally agree with that but then how do you separate people into more hardcore and less than more hardcore?
---
I hope you're not a minion necro. Or idk, it's up to your wife  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
that's somewhat worrying. do you think the skyscale """issue""" was Anet responding to that market or it was actually warranted? 
---
as much as i was annoyed by the stop/start timegates &amp; way Anet marketed it, i quickly got over it (and myself) and just played. 
---
(if so) i'm hoping Anet don't keep sacrificing themselves as a quick pacifier for that crowd.
---
This. I don't do it on sword weaver, but bust out FA Tempest for nostalgia and disappointment? Immediate shuffling.
---
With links came the words. Don't worry guys if links do not work we can change this. Ever since links became a thing dedicated WvW players please remove links, but nothing happens, noone is heard. Links are still a thing. Even though anyone and their gold fish at this point realise that merging would be the best thing. They now go with this, which will hurt WvW again. And when we say please remove this i bet you, there wont be a word comming from them in years to come about what we dont want. 
---
So don't try to poke us in the eye with promises made in the past showing they will not redo or removed anything even if we beg them to stop.
---
lol i was there too for that event
---
Or you could read back in history and see how promises of we can change this have never been changed when we begged them to reverse. Why should we belive they will now?
---
Damn playing this gamemode is so fun! :)
---
So this is how they are going to "fix" wvw? Guess alliances is too hard to handle for them.
---
&gt; ...he kept bursting the boss causing multiple Vets to spawn despite repeatedly being asked not to do so.
---
God this speaks to me. I swear people dont listen/read or pay any attention to what that boss does. Like ffs just do a bit of dmg 10% or something before the shield pops then run around and kill the tiny ooze and stack for boons before the shield ends then cc and burst. The number of times I have explained this to groups only to have one or more players insta break the bar and dps then ignore everything that isnt the boss is depressing to think about.
---
The other person missed the question it seems.
---
Don't do rifts, they don't count.
---
Start at bridge between FoW and Underworld. Should be 10 there. Then up on top of the cliffs in the Center South of the underworld is a series of trails for a total of 25 more. Also, in the middle around the camp area, there is a big long trial of about 40. It starts or ends on top of the Claw, if you need a reference point.
---
Lastly, head to the Wing. Find the Skyscale Roost to the **southwest** of the wing. There are two trails of about 10 -15 there. Take one of them up. I side the wing is another trail. Then go back to where you came up, and take the second trail down.
---
All told you get a little over 100 this route. Just swap characters a couple times and you can rush this in about 20 minutes.
---
I started hating scavenger hunts in late LS3 and wouldn't even bother doing them later on. First part of skyscale was pretty stupid since it had 3 of those on nearly same locations. The rest of the collection was fine.
---
What Anet did was pretty unnecessary considering that skyscale is far from a must-have feature.
---
They’ve appeared to be allocating a lot more resources into gw2 since that whole fiasco. There’s been much more advertising and communication too. Community engagement is up and we have an accurate picture of their plan to keep it that way and keep content relevant (with the new bonus event, mat sinks, etc.)
---
Lots of people play this game, and in terms of progression it’s one-of-a-kind on the market. I’m confident that anet is planning for the long haul and not just giving up on their only current cash cow.
---
well mine is working and i just replaced d3d9.dll
---
There is still a huge difference between being able to write something understandable in chat and using voicechat in a foreign language. I have several guildmates that can after slowly reading chat guess what is meant and answer, but there is no way they can join in a English team speak. So they either stop playing wvw, stop communicating or there will be separate communities trying to play on the same team.
---
&gt; *If you do not have proper proof*, remove the character and player name as well as the guild tag.
---
👌
---
I honestly hate that mentality. Everytime something was very easy to obtain for me in a game, I kind of forgot about it/didn't feel like I accomplished something. It's weird to me bc I always thought it should feel rewarding when you get some of that stuff, but a lot of the time it's so easy to get that I just get bored with it. 
---
I liked the skyscale collection for the most part, since it's a prestige mount so it did feel like I was actually working towards it. 
---
If it was a regular mount that was needed for story progression or the like I could kind of see why some people didn't like it but even then I didn't find the actual collection bits hard at all. A bit time consuming maybe, but not hard.
---
Rev shield also had it's use in some niche PvP builds and Deimos handkiting if that's still a thing.
---
Outside of them very specific situations though, they're pretty meh.
---
Spanish and English .. your point ?
---
I went from liking Braham to disliking him to liking him again. He was annoying for a while, but the arc felt like a natural progression for him and paced believably (moreso than character development in GoT season 8). 
---
I have to applaud the writers for having heroes that aren't likable 100 percent of the time. And I have to applaud Braham himself for growing in character and changing for the better after a dark turn. For some people, the ability to grow and change makes him an even bigger hero.
---
PoF has things for both Kormir &amp; Balthazar blessed Humans.  
---
Kormir : when you meet her  
---
Balthazar : when facing Balthazar or Zafira.
---
Alright np. For Scepter Focus for gear get all mara with some berserk as you get more comfortable. Full mara you get maybe 17k i run berk till im at about 14k but its all up to you. 
---
Scholar runes onces you get comfortable staying back and 1 shotting. You can run strenght till then if u feel your uptime is low. 
---
Build is Air Middle middle middle
---
This gives you superspeed everytime u go into air and u go into it often. The second lowers air cds which is most of your damage and the last is the name of the build fresh air. That lets u go to have almost no cd on air attune
---
Arcane
---
You can do any on the first row i go for the top that hives dmg every crit. The middle for extra dodges is nice and the last 1 gives u a little more healing but really if u trying to heal up with this you are playing wrongdo more damage to stop their damage. A
---
2nd row arcane go with bottom till you get used to the squish then go middle 
---
3rd get the 1 that roots people with arcane missle and also gives u crit dam buff when u use
---
Weaver for last
---
Go top for 1st row then middle( bottom if u want stab) and last get top for 10%dam on double attunes which you do a lot with air air. 
---
Skills
---
Always use
---
Skills - twist of fate
---
Arcane blast - usually use with earth
---
Pick 1
---
Lightnign flash - tele not as far as mes
---
Stone barrier stance skill- if u take this id take weaver tier 2 bottom skill that hibes u stab. If u want to be tankier i would take this but again. Do more dmg dont bet touched
---
Heal signet. U cast a lot it keeps u healthy
---
Elite weave self - shortens attune cds and it makes u feel like a true turret
---
If you are new to weaver i recommend getting used to how the attunements change. You are split with your first two skills being your most recent attunement and your 4/5 being youe previous. 
---
So if you hit fire then air your skills woll be
---
1 air auto attack 
---
2 lighting strike your big insta dam
---
3 will be a fire/air dial skill and this 1 is your big pump. This 1.5 channel can hit for 12k if u get your buffs right. 
---
4 will be fire field
---
5 fire aura
---
So once you hit another attune lets say earth it goes to
---
1 eart aa (terrible never use)
---
2 armor and big damage (very nice)
---
3 a 1.5 sec cc 
---
4 projectile denial winds big against rangers eng war
---
5 gale your 4 sec knockdown. You will be able to kill people inside this Cc alone with combos ill write on later. 
---
 You slowly go thru skills whichs gives u a  nice mix but it also means your biggest def abilities air 5 for cc water 45 for cc and earth 4 for cleanse and earth 5 for a 4 sec invul. 
---
Combos (f2 =fire2 a1 =air auto attack etc)
---
1 shot star fire air
---
F2
---
Arcane missle
---
A5
---
A/F3 
---
Attune to fire
---
F3
---
When phoenix comes back to u lightning flash past them so it hits them again. 
---
Dmg total after 3seconds
---
F2 - 12k
---
F3 - 18k
---
FA3- 11k
---
Air sttune 3k
---
A2 4-6k
---
As u can see big damage all inside your knockdown. 
---
There is a couple more
---
Earth/ air
---
Get your e2 
---
Ea3 - into
---
Then can go into previous combo or if u are running away go water attune
---
W2
---
E3/4 gives invul 
---
Fire attune
---
FW 3 1 sec evade 
---
W4/5 to kite and daze buy time
---
Fire2
---
Back earth root them in it with arcane missle and go into air and aa
---
You always want to chain your air aa whenever you can when switching into earth or water. Water auto attack is actually ok but really u want to be doin other things
---
Air auto is a long channel but the last half is almost has much as your fire air mix skill. You can start your air aa and get the low dam out of the way before u get in range. You can use air 2 when casting anything else keep it on cd. Remember changing to air does damage and always crits so keep people or something targeted when running away. 
---
When running best skills are air 2actually all the 2s water earth fire all good while on the run. Same with most mix skills u are very mobile so dont be in melee u just give them damage for free u are long range caster boi. Water air 3 and fire air 3 need u to be facing the target for them to go off so make sure u have about face bound. This is an OP keybind for people that can use it inwish there was this button i. Oww oh whag i would gobe for this in wow. 
---
Twist of fate is not a use whenever skill that is your oh fuck so use it wisely. If u see a warrior charging this is when u use it if u see a mecro open this is qhen u use it but as always use your dodge first twist can be used to get out of the stunnut dontbe shit use it jalf a second sooner and u dont get any condis or dmage at all. 
---
Ok phone getting hot typing is getting slow lol. If u have any more questionslet me know i can post a build link on my desktop. Enjoy i dont see many people run this it feels like just me in wvw but inlove it have fun and gl
---
Fair enough.
---
Though on a personal note, I wish more people would just learn english. It's not a hard language to grasp and it makes life a hell of a lot easier, seeing how it's pretty much the *lingua franca* of Europe and many other regions as well.
---
But that's kinda besides the point I guess.
---
Oooo, if that’s true looking forward to when I get my rev to face Balthazar!
---
&gt; Isn't that why they are working on alliances? Because links wasn't a permanent solution?
---
My answer was to this specific answer from you.
---
Braham is a whiny piece of shit.
---
This, 100%. Characters don’t always have to be likeable, even if it’s frustrating. If a character is evoking any kind of reaction, the writer is doing their job.
---
Queen Jennah poping a city size shield did not seem weak to me.  
---
People theory is that she's the goddess Lyssa.
---
I’m beginning to think your language skills may be playing a part in this issue.
---
gratz
---
Congrats!
---
I was lucky enough to have people porting when I did it. Not my idea of a fun jp.
---
I always thought the Norn needed some retouching. If it were up to me, I would have made their animal forms a toggle and then given them the associated skills with maybe a small special effect when they're for the elite forms were used. They're just big humans who've had a lot of their history and culture ignored and relegated to oafishness in the extreme... a shame really.
---
I got bored before I finished the first collection
---
Expansions have been taking them around 2 years to make each, That comment suggest one was not in the plans last year.
---
Unclear if layoffs changed their plans but the earliest we would see it would be 2020 unless extra manpower speeds up the proccess massively.
---
Also just because they're being told to focus on GW2 doesn't necessarily mean expansions is how they want to monitize.
---
There are other options, Such as selling Elite specs or as many are speculating - A season pass of some sort.
---
I hope I'm wrong though but with how little info we get from Arenanet regarding what they are working on, All we can do is speculate.
---
nerd
---
It was either race as fashion or race-locked classes.  
---
With only Norn being able to be Warrior because a Human wouldn't stand a chance without magic.
---
While the Olmakhan were a nice twist on Charr culture, they aren't the Charr the player are used to, and their involvement in the previous stories was null. 
---
What I'd like to see, and I think many of us, is more stories involving the Ascalonian Charr, what is happening within the three Legions, what's left of the Fire Legion and the Ascalonian Ghosts, what's the relationship like with Ebonhawk, and honestly few words about the Brand in Ascalon would be nice, because Kralkatorrik affected the region the most alongside Elona, and ignoring that seems like a huge oversight in the narrative.
---
Or German. Or Swedish. Or Spanish. Some people just don't want to speak English...
---
If we put LS3 as released "recently" then Mursaat Brogans are same shoes for every weight class.
---
this is strictly for wvw..but yea overall power builds have more perks in many scenarios
---
in some pve raid fights renegade and mirage are absolutely broken op!
---
doesn't mean it's absolute garbage in wvw either, for example some people play trapper rangers, tanky condi mirage builds or condi necros while roaming and get decent results
---
but yea overall power seems stronger..good luck
---
Hopefully they forgot to block the last dye pack!
---
Background: I was at Sparkfly Fen around 30 min. before Tequatl. Before going AFK for a bit, I decided to use my Golem novelty and auto-cast "Check the Code," because why not?
---
Around 5-10 before Teq. started, I come back and see this: two other random people spamming "Check the Code," resulting in a hilariously obnoxious cacophony of beeps and boops. I thought it was a really funny thing to come back to, but after the interaction above happened, it was just downright hilarious. It made my day! Y'all are the best!
---
Hey guys, i created this video as i feel it's a topic not a lot of people are taking into consideration. Everyone wants expansion 3, but what does this mean for our beloved mounts? I listed what i believe are some of the more obvious options as food for thought.
---
I'm curious to hear what you think about this subject. Please make sure the comments remain friendly towards each other as i'm sure we all have the best for the game in mind :)
---
PS: I'm very sorry for the occasional mouth click coming into the mic. I tried my hardest to get rid of them but some had to stay :(  
---
Here's to hoping other people don't mind them as much as i do.
---
As player who didn't had dedicated server in mother language in first place, you better get used to it!
---
There also are a lot of easy builds to play that are meant to kill bosses and not necessarily to speedclear it. Websites like Snow Crow (and Lucky Noobs) will focus on meta build description but other less effective buy more affordable builds are available in the game. Sadly you won't see that much PoV from those classes but they are great to start IMHO. To me, having someone not that experimented in a wing and his character either but that has an kinda easy rotation can spend more time being aware of the mechanics etc, and then later be more confident with less easy-to-start rotations when the boss is known (and you have mates to trust #MyDodgeIsAnAegis)
---
It really do be like that
---
happened to rev too, they didn't deal with rev's might generation correctly or their autos either lol
---
It impacts us just as much as playing for fights. They have equal personal impact. The only difference is some people enjoy one over the other.
---
Dongs per sexytime ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
---
Well the most glaring issue with English as a foreign language seems to be that you cannot infer how to speak a word just by looking at it.
---
So written English is pretty easy. Spoken English, however, is often not worth the hassle if you don't get to practice it with some regularity.
---
It is quite hard to understand someone who pronunces duck as duke, fry as free, though as thought and so on.
---
If anything German should be used in vocal. Hardly any variation there in how you pronounce the same syllab in different words.
---
Or, we could all switch to Esperanto I guess.
---
Yes we can, i sometimes send gold to an Italian friend, je than converts it to gems and gifts me the keys.
---
Sometime it's fun to roll, but only with gold
---
Fights improve your gameplay. Ppt is a waste of time without enemy responding.
---
Provided by the Charr.
---
Reward tracks? You mean renown hearts? I wasnt aware that reward tracks gave karma as well
---
I used to refer back to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8dy1xv/glyphs_glyphs_glyphs_money_and_more_glyphs/) and the spreadsheet in it but it's no longer working. So let's look at [volatile magic shipments](http://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html), Trophies are currently at almost 1.5g after selling and if you take a look at the [wiki's page on droprate/profit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment/Drop_rate#Average_profit.2Floss_per_Trophy_Shipment) you'll see that on average (if I'm calculating this right) 1 magic is worth 54-59c. If you buy the [glyph for 500-700g](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Volatility_\(Unused\)) and lets say you average 6 magic per harvest (per normal node) it would take over 15,400 nodes to make a profit (for the cost of one glyph at buy price for both).
---
LMFAO
---
so many calls are in english anyways - at least on german servers..i honestly don't think that the language barrier in any server combination will be hard to break
---
works in other competitive games too btw
---
r/namechecksout
---
I'll try this thank you
---
Proper alliance balancing would have never worked on EU servers with a single spanish server. This is a good decision.
---
Exactly. They told us to come up with some sort pay back to compensate the loss in dmg but all we have now, almost 3 years later, is a at best mediocore boon support spec which is more or less useless in PvE at least.
---
D&amp;D is the nickname given to the producers/writers of Game of Thrones, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And don't worry they are going on to Star Wars as well to "subvert expectations".
---
that's the worrying part for me. time consuming in a video game is the point isn't it? the whole point is to do things and take part in this simulated world. &amp; yeah, it makes sense some people didn't like the collection. 
---
but i've been noticing so many players acting as if they've been screwed over by Anet because if they don't do it, they're missing out. or that they "shouldn't have to do x to get y" and that mentality just baffles my mind. 
---
who exactly is forcing these people to make their own lives miserable..
---
The Jungle Dragon loves all his children!  Lie still and you will be carried to a blighting pos momentarily.
---
I can’t really think of many instances in any of the LWs4 maps that REQUIRE a mount. 
---
Off the top of my head
---
-accessing certain masteries
---
-completing races
---
-gathering vm
---
Feel free to add to that list if you can think of anything else. 
---
It seems to me, mounts are more of a QoL thing. You mention achievements or the speed in which one might complete events, and of course people will feel gimped, but are they being stonewalled? Or is it just that it might take more time to complete? 
---
There is also the ability to rent a mount, so for races or adventures you could always rent a mount. 
---
My final point is that it would be foolish for anet to release an expansion that nullifies the need for PoF. It would be smarter, imo, to design a map that can be completed with, or without mounts, and aside from specific instances in PoF where you need certain mounts to access areas, I can’t think of a lws4 map that requires mounts to complete.  Again, correct me if in wrong
---
I've looked at the game a little and i see a lot of charm, shame I wasn't playing GW1 back then, i don't see myself going back in time now.
---
You don't talk from moral standpoint when money mixed in
---
Not an issue in phonetic languages (if that's the right term) like Finnish. You know how to pronounce each alphabet -&gt; you now know how to pronounce every single Finnish word in existence.
---
But yeah, not perhaps suggesing that everyone should learn Finnish :&gt;
---
Why would belgium cry over not being able to be a part of the international shame?
---
They changed or are supposed to change ranger to use commands not shouts. UI doesn't show that.
---
So you learned Chinese then i assume?
---
Isnt german allready a lingua franca in the burocratic ot the european union together with french and english?
---
This will kill EU WvW for French, German and Spanish players btw. Shrinking the already small player base for WvW even further. Anets shitty decisions somehow manage to still surprise me every time.
---
I'd say the game has LS5 for sure; so 1 to 1.5 years potentially before another expansion.  Alternatively, they could take an interim period similar to Pre-Heart of thorns/Silverwastes and try to set the game up for a long period of inactivity.  I think the game is probably set for another 3-4 years, but the success or failure of LS5 is going to be the crucial linchpin.
---
Whoever thinks those numbers should stay like that needs to go to a corner and reconsider their whole mentality.
---
I already spent 100+ gold on it so not gonna back off, however I've been stuck at the map currency part for a week
---
Karma train in wvw. Reward tracks earned by tiering up your participation, which comes from taking camps, keeps, towers, flipping ogres/frogs, killing doly’s, which all give between 300-1000 karma each.
---
Those are some great points man! I like the rental system. It feels to me like an expanded upon system they use for the skyscale / griffon where you need it. I also love how it plays into the "enticing people to still buy PoF" aspect that i hammered on quite a bit in the vid
---
i think you and i are of a somewhat similar mind when it comes to Anet's direction lately. i'm not sure why, but for some reason, the world-building feels like it's been severely lacking for quite some time. i've only been keeping up with living story out of necessity of literally following the story. for whatever reason though, it feels like a completely separate entity from the actual gw2 universe as a whole. (which is a ludicrous feeling seeing as kralk is/was part of the driving force of the entire game)
---
i'm a lore nerd in that, when i feel interactions with other races in-game i feel the connection. 
---
i lose that connection as the all-powerful pact commander that we've become as this story has progressed. my favourite parts of the game are the home cities of all the races because it feels like there's so much untapped lore potential for things to happen there but it's just an instance stuck in time. 
---
i know zojja is written out of the story but it would've been nice to get SOMETHING. we have so many lose ends where all they need is a simple mail saying "zojja's become a vegetable and will never talk again" 
---
not sure if you feel the same/ similar, i don't even know what i'm saying anymore. you mentioned lore and now i'm all riled up hahah
---
What are the kiters supposed to be hitting to trigger Parasitic Contagion or Invigorating Precision?
---
Yeah i do fully agree. The prospect of having to wait another 2 ish years for more specs would suck. I also agree with some other posters that mounts aren't the only thing they can add in an excap as i do agree they are hitting full saturation. That is, unless we're moving underwater where i feel a new dimension of mounts opens up to make it feel fresh.
---
The main point i tried to touch upon was what anet does with the mounts we have right now.
---
&gt; Almost every game DOES have animation locks... Smite has tonnes of them. Why are you talking about casting spells all of a sudden?
---
When poeple say animation locks they mean that most things lock you in place while doing a fancy animation with a long GCD without you able to cancel it, lots of anime games do that for example.
---
&gt;You mean totally unfun one shots? As I said, that's because damage is higher in GW2.
---
​
---
&gt;Longer fights take more skill. That person pressed two buttons.
---
You don't get oneshot if you know what you are doing, the mesmer won't oneshot my ele with 7 evades, also, the mesmer has to press 7 buttons in the right order within 1 second or the burst fails, that is what i call high skillcap.
---
Evade, invul and dodge right and you won't get oneshot it is that simple, whenever i oneshot someone it's a bad, i had 20 minute fights before which where very intense, you fail to dodge 1 DJ from a deadeye and you die so these fights take tons of mechanical skill, way more than any tab target MMO i have played before.
---
&gt;You can't outheal as many players on GW2 as you can on FFXIV. And it's usually self-sustain instead of healing.
---
I can sustain 2 poeple, sometimes even 3 on my ele or boonbeast. Also, if you can sustain multiple poeple with just heals that is just shit balance, no one should be invincible just because of heals, that also brings a reliance on heals which just makes the game stale and unbalanced. Look at Smite for example, you can't just spam heals and live vs a team infinitely, literally just tab target MMO's do this as a byproduct of how PvE is played, broken heals has never been fun to play or watch.
---
&gt;How is pressing 2 buttons harder than a long battle where the most skilled player wins?
---
See explaination above.
---
&gt;A healer's position should not have to suck because of a teammate's.
---
That's just called teamwork, look at firebrands in Gw2, they are totally meta and usable yet all their heals are aoe around them, no one has problems.
---
nice try anet
---
Yes you do. I'm not even sure why you think that would be exempt.
---
Wow... I've never received that rejoinder before. You are very clever.
---
Exactly, the model is totally fair. I can’t afford a car/insurance in my city so I ride a bike, I have friends with cars and more “freedom” than me, but financially, I can accept that. 
---
Sure this is an mmo and my example doesn’t apply exactly, but the paying customer should have access to the features they paid for, devaluing a customer such that non paying customers have similar access to paid features is a worse idea than giving non paying customers less features. 
---
One thing we haven’t touched on is the possibility of more than one person on a singular mount. I can imagine syncing two people on a mount could be very difficult for anet, but its a potential feature, which could allow for players to have access to mounts without devaluing the paying customer.
---
havent watched your video (will go to bed now), but I think it wouldnt be so bad to make 5 new mounts that have exactly the same (or similar) skills like the PoF mounts. so xpac 3 players are on the same level as PoF players and PoF players could just used the mount they like more.
---
another thing would be to just straight up disable PoF/season 4 mounts in xpac 3. so that we have to acquire a new set of mounts especially made for xpac 3.
---
Mate have you watched German TV? There is no such thing as non-dubbed content on 99% of the channels 
---
^(Although to be fair the Dubs are usually outstanding Quality, some few times even better than the original.)
---
see what _doesn't_ surprise me is the fact that your name being pointed out is reoccurring, asshole, maybe take a look at your personality and try to figure out why
---
Same question was asked 6 hours ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c0yhee/how_to_feed_your_skyscale_volatile_magic/
---
nice erp
---
I like both and I play both hence my statement. PPT for the purpose of having more stuff on the map in your color is a waste of time, especially when you can do the same thing in pve with a lot more variety and rewards.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh man, if they could figure out how to create a "party mount"  and make it feel a bit like being in a halo tank (for lack of a better example), gameplay wise, that would be so good.
---
I really do feel like we're due for a refreshing update. The skyscale to me already felt a bit less interesting than previous mounts.
---
It is only mentioned by the truly inventive folks with important things to say.
---
Just because you like both doesn't mean you speak for everyone who enjoys either one.
---
Both are a waste of time or time well spent depending on the individual and what they enjoy. Both are just parts of playing a video game, neither one is actually productive. It's all about enjoyment.
---
They spawn in the same location as the orbs (the three circles in between each pyre), though not in sync with the orb spawns.
---
Kind of a condi fight, it's mainly torment damage. So axe mirage, and renegade is also very good. Other than that DH and the like is fine.
---
hint: don't play warrior on HoT maps, I feel like it's pretty useless there.
---
Yeah i touched upon that in another comment. Having local counterparts to the PoF mounts would work. I'm however not sure i want them investing months of development into mounts that are not really all that new to an existing player.
---
I'm personally a big fan of your second option. However i'm afraid i'm very much in a minority here. Love having a fresh start in a new xpac.
---
OMG...
---
"people come to discord pls... wait... no don't come"
---
It will be a disaster.
---
I wonder if there's a block limit cause hoo boy it's time gotta catch em all!
---
Organize language specific squads and comunicate between them. 
---
Ok every body ready? Let's push but wait i must comunicate with other squad (something something in spannish to other language specific squad) ok empower and put veil to the right, wait i must comunicate to language specific squad (something something in spannish) ok push, waith i must comunicate to language specific squad (push in spannish).
---
Wait why are everybody dead and we did not even start and what killed us? Wait i must speak with lanaguage specific squad (something something in spannish about what killed us before we got to push)
---
Ok i am being silly here i know that, but i still have a point. It gets to complicated on something that in voice tool is about fast comunicate in best possible way for all to react too as fast as possible. There is no room for special squad translating and there is a high risk that one of the groups will fall behind and not really get the fast action we are used to have.
---
That's actually pretty interesting. Would have thought English was a tad higher since a lot of countries I've been to (from the UK) seem to teach English as a second language after their mother tongue.
---
I'm guessing Dutch and French follow close behind English due to the old colonisation effect?
---
Please don't take this personally, but fuck you. 
---
And congrats.
---
Meanwhile I just dont know what to do with all these dumb makeover kits. Yay.
---
I have the problem of making characters that are already in my head, then trying to match their aesthetic - and then I come up with backstories that demand aesthetics, and I start hunting skins, and all of a sudden I’ve paid $50 and I haven’t had a steady sleep schedule for a month.
---
My current projects two projects are:

*a norn necromancer, child of an OC and Eir, who ends up in an accident with an artifact in the Brand and becomes partially Branded herself.

Somebody needs to take the game away from me. Or maybe not. I have a lot of fun getting a skin and coming up with reasons why somebody would wear it.
---
Any class and spec are perfectly fine in HoT. The expansion is a step up in difficulty from core Tyria and requires you to spend some time learning the basic attacks /patterns of HoT enemies in order to survive. 
---
Warrior is one of the better classes to learn on due to it having the highest armour class and HP pool.
---
Were you born like this or did it happen after the accident?
---
Yes
---
how do you spend 100g on that O.o
---
Arenanet please don't...
---
You are a company that doesn't think twice when butchering gameplay to make it inclusive for everyone, but you are ready to take this risk? Unless it's a temporary first step towards alliances, I do not understand or agree with this at all.
---
Not only it's already hard enough for commanders to make people who understand listen, many comms and the wvw as a community is very salty when things don't go well and there'll be non-stop insults and belittling not only in discord/TS but also in chat.
---
Calling French "baguettes" will be the mildest thing read/heard when they are linked to an english server.
---
Yeah i touched upon that in another comment as well. While it would be fine in terms of design for new players, there's no way vets are interesting in acquiring mounts that are barely different to the current ones. I mean, the skyscale already sort of did that for me, and it's still a reasonably unique mount.
---
too bad the commander wasn't
---
That reminds me a bit of final fantasy
---
&gt; I do not know enough to speak about French or Spannish players but i can only guess it is roughly the same.
---
yes, exactly the same. Can't wait to see french people react on chat to EB (CBE in french) castle being referred as SM (which in french means BDSM). It's called BP otherwise (Brumepierre). And it's the same for every place. After 7 years of game, there is no way they will accept to use different designations. 
---
I played a lot of eotm, and the chat was already a mess most of the time, between german only, french only, and sometimes pol only.
---
Orbs? As in Gorseval's orbs? Ugh, I can only imagine how old these guides are. Must be quite a memory trip to a mirrior comp times and beyond.
---
Chairs have the same endurance bar values as mounts because a chair is technically a mount. Players have player-endurance and mount-endurance so to say. All mounts (and thus chairs) share the same mount-endurance bar, even if some of them might have specifically coded behavior for it (e.g. beetle resetting it to 0 if swapped from another mount).
---
That, however, probably does not make it any easier to have it share dyes with the actual mount. I can imagine player-ownable mounts are coded differently, use a different model (that is capable of advanced movement systems and animations), have the capability to have dye channels (chairs don't inherently need dye channels, as player will never have an opportunity to dye chairs), have the capability to have skins etc.
---
It could also have been a conscious decision on their part because they didn't want to bother making sure that every skyscale skin they're going to release works well with the chair and doesn't cause - ohmygosh - clipping.
---
Get over it.
---
They don't need access to your bank card to buy loot boxes. If they get cash or any money in any other form they can use it to buy loot boxes by purchasing gift cards.
---
The time for casual players is over. The new, tougher generation of players will be forged in the flames of war. They may be fewer than us, but they learn to solo champions 69 levels higher than them. While naked. With only one utility skill.
---
Yea this doesn't feel natural at all tho.
---
Which might work, *if you could sell the BL chest exclusives on the trading post*. If you get lucky and get one? Great! If you just want to buy it from someone else that has? Great!
---
The current system is just rubbish all around.
---
Same!  The vast openess of the PoF maps are kind of cool too, but nothing beats the verticality you can get in the HoT maps.  Sometimes just jumping from a really high point and seeing how far you can fall feels absolutely incredible.
---
dang i want to be that
---
Does anyone know why they scale our level and stats down when we are in a lower level PvE area? Im level 26 dying to level 18s during quests. That should not even be possible. Help?
---
Oh god please no - reversing gravity and orbiting around targets is still just a different flavor of underwater combat.
---
I'm a full time carer for my wife who's disabled. It means I'm homebound by circumstance. The game not only keeps me sane and gives me a pool of people to socialize with, because I"m a social person, but it allows my wife who wouldn't otherwise be able to get out an explore to both have some people to talk to (she's not a social as I am in part due to her injury) and get to see some sights, even if they're virtual sights. 
---
Before Guild Wars 2 we played Guild Wars 1, Rift, a bit of WoW (which didn't work as much). 
---
The game allows her to engage her active mind, while not being too physically intense.
---
we've also got quality armor
---
take a look!
---
from reading other replies, i'm maybe understanding this sentiment more.
---
i really only play League and Guild Wars 2. LoL because the ARAM game mode is a shit-storm and i'd rather be in the chaos since Riot doesn't care about their customers (and SOMEtimes it can be fun)
---
i play guild wars 2 however, because as far as MMORPG's stand, it seems to be the best out- for me at least.
---
i haven't been able to find a game with action combat, racial diversity, community involvement, deep customization of armor and lore that was as interesting as Gw2's universe.
---
that being said, i wouldn't particularly be able to tell whether or not the timegate/ grind is unreasonable. and many would argue the term "content" is subjective in a way. other MMOs i used to play were ragnarok online, flyff, maplestory- all which were relatively short-lived in many aspects.
---
I've done raiding a hand full of times with a few different pugs idk why people say its toxic. People just expect you to show up with a fully baked build and a semi learned rotation, with buffs
---
I feel like discussing p2w aspects in a game where you can literally buy gold with $ is a moot point.
---
SM is called SN for german servers. The first time i played wvw on my second account that is on an international server is was confused for a sec.
---
With the release of mounts I suspected that there will be no third expansion and will just keep releasing LS or it will be entirely different (like underwater based).
---
I think the best way to solve problem with  mounts from PoF would be if third expansion (if it is gonna happen) will let you obtain certain PoF mounts (just three: raptor, springer and skimmer) which will require more resources (such as gold) if you didn't got them from PoF. This would let devs create maps where basic mounts will be necessary and thus still important. They could make some additional areas (not important in story, events or map completion) where Jackal, Beetle, Griffon and Skyscale would be necessary to actually explore.
---
Anet also seemed to test how masteries from HoT-LS3 used in Jahai Bluffs and Dragonfall would coexist alongside mounts and also see playerbase reaction about bringing back some stuff from previous expansion/ls. Maybe they want to include these as well in third expansion to fully (or just make it easier to) explore map.

Difference is that the MF removes the need to pay in order to ”gamble” in it. If I want to ”gamble” for mystic clovers I can grind my way to buy the mats that require it. When it comes to BL it’s buy or farm weekly with a *ridiculous* chance of getting any value. If I want to craft Dusk, I can do a collection to earn it. If I want a specific BL exclusive item I need to pay money for it.
---
No one here is shitting on RNG, that’s a big part of what MF is. Difference is I don’t have to cough up money in order to use it, which is why it’s an rng mechanic compared to gambling.
---
Yes, though English is preferred, communication might happen if one part does not speak English but French or German instead.
---
But most of the time, English or grabbing a translator is most common for communicating between different member states in unofficial capacity
---
Axe mirage, by a good margin.
---
It’s not the same. People aren’t killing mobs as a method of farming precursors.
---
Yes it those 20% are the most likely to utilize a language other than their mother tongue to travel, business, or education
---
I've seen these numbers before with 80% average uptime on quickness and alac, 20 average stacks of might, and perma fury.
---
Because they want you to be to able to feel like you can play with friends and so content doesn't feel super obsolete as you progress.
---
Your gear should still be better than it was at level 18 though, so you shouldn't have any major problems dealing with mobs at that level
---
You can't go to school in Germany without also learning English. (That goes for all people who are &lt;54 years old)
---
It wouldn't be as unberable if the animations weren't so absurdly uninspired honestly.
---
Yeah on NA I often have to be speaking both English and Spanish as well as at least trying in Portuguese.
---
Kind of funny to see EU, which is typically thought to be more multicultural, terrified at the prospects of having to use more than just their national language.
---
.. Honey we know the names?
---
And less spiders.
---
This so silly. On NA we pretty much always have to be using both English and Spanish. It’s not hard to use two languages even if you aren’t great in one of them.
