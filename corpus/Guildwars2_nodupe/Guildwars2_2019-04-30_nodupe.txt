Have you looked for current open world builds on sites like meta battle?
---
---
---
TT is old hat now.. most players have done all the associated achievements.
---

---
That and it requires a LOT of co-ordination, something the average World Boss mob lacks.
---
&gt; Soul Grasp: (BUFF)--This skill is pretty great, though it is a competitive pick now, so it wasnt an outright buff to the class (which is a good move by ANet imo). To appreciate the skill you have to realize it competes with Dec Defenses, a free 50% crit trait in PvE that easily brings most people to perm-100% crit.
---
That is Soul Eater. Soul Grasp is Focus #4

Disclaimer: This event never took place. It's just a story I came up after hearing guildie's funny quote. 
---
Some phone art again and testing new tricks for drawing.
---
&gt;our intention is to remove the daily cap on **all** world meta event completion rewards
---
this sounds like a really iffy idea *or* they're gonna have to drive PoF rewards through the roof to not just have people farm HoT metas nonstop all week
---
Yes, and I know my profession and skills. I have a dire set stored in bank for 2 years...
---
Dire set will not make condi warrior kill mobs too slow becaue sword/torch/longbow are area condi spammer.
---
I might just boost a Mesmer and do a Mirage, my Mesmer is already level 40 anyway. :) Ty.
---
If you post those kinds of... "suggestions" in my forum I would ip ban you.
---
Since the topic of the post was special events they're doing and your suggestion was about making a meta event permanently more profitable it was off topic and not necessary to put in that place. Off topic posts remain off topic.
---
Time to (ab)use my world boss teleport device.
---
I phrased it wrong, I actually could (if I knew how). The guy is selling me the computer already clean and I'm going to add the SSD. I'll just settle with gw2 in it since I have no clue how to install the windows, drivers and all that stuff... I'm too afraid to try it and end up screwing with the computer lol
---
This bench is a joke
---
Nobody uses Shadow Arts *in raids* because it doesn't increase their damage.  Don't need to delve deeper there.
---
You do need to delve deeper if you want to explain why it isn't used much anywhere else in the game.
---
As I say, they were exactly the same as other world bosses before the megaservers introduction, and still give the bonus chests. They just got left by the wayside
---
People like you need to disappear from the community
---
&gt; a sorry lame excuse for content
---
I am sorry for those who dont like them.
---
The meta boss one is coming out a few weeks after this one so this means anywhere between 2-3 weeks given they likely need to patch the event into the game.
---
Yea dumb people often say that to smart people to make themselves feel better
---
A lot has changed, but people's minds is usually not amongst it and that's the biggest pity.
---
I have one of every class + 2 thiefs and 2 mesmers. My Ranger is my PvE main, my WvW main is my necro then I have a engi, warrior, and ele that I bring into WvW when I need to. Everything else is there so that when my guild leader asks me to play something else I can say "oh I have one but it's not geared up." I'm sure someday I'll level them up...eventually. Maybe. For now though, I really need the bank space that they provide.
---
Most world bosses take only a few minutes to kill, and you loot rares and other things. Definitely worth doing them on and off for fun at least.
---
Warrior is actually a good example of this, you can run a power build with axe/axe as your main damage and have a weapon swap of mace/mace only to cc (crowd control, things like stun, daze, knockback, etc). Especially in open world don't feel forced to swap weapons if you want to stick to one, it's very useful to have more options and skills to access but not a huge deal. Alternatively you can put one axe in main hand set 1 and the other in off hand set 2, this allows you to "swap" while still only using axe/axe. Take a look at [something like this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Axe/Axe_Arms) as a suggestion. The other professions that don't swap much usually have some other mechanics that swap instead (engineer has kits, elementalist attunements,  revenant legends and weapon swapping). [Power revenant](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Glint) also runs a second weapon set just to CC so that's another good option. Oh and thief has no cooldown on skills so they usually run one weapon set (dagger/dagger or staff on power) for damage and then have a free slot for whatever they want (usually shortbow for the teleport utility) something like [this open world build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Bounding_Staff).
---
Most of the events happen every two hours meaning you can only do them at most 12 times a day anyway.
---
Don't you dare JP are one of the core things that loved in this game.
---
Google GW2 Exchange Reddit - there are some ppl who buy and sell guild storage banks.
---
50 storage guild is quieter cheap. Don’t got a price in my head atm.

The 250 slot guild is round 1k - 1.2k Gold worth.
---
Sorry but what?  Doesn't extreme offense simultaneously mean no defense and thus downable?   Why does extreme offense mean victory in your mind?
---
Thanks for making yourself look fucking stupid as all hell on the internet.
---
That is a power based build running greatsword and longbow (not shortbow). It is pretty outdated, I havn't run PvP ranger in a long while now but it looks like[ this build is more up to date](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Sic_%27Em_Sniper).

I appreciate your civility in pointing those out; I didn't notice the individual skill damage or the all condi's. Traits not being shown is certainly a problem however perhaps I'm being naive in believing someone wouldn't falsify benchmarks

Sometime it shows up slow on the bank. I once bought gems at the start of the month, and suddenly see the transaction at the end of the month. Freak me out since I've forgotten about the gem i bought.

Too soon
---
1.) Yes Springer 3 is totally amazing for general exploration. Makes a huge difference.
---
1.5) Not really ? Chance at a key , and the hot maps give a specific item needed for gen 2 legendaries , if you're interested in that.
---
2.) look at metabattle or snowcrows and see whether the scrapper or holosmith builds appeal to you more.
---
3.) wvw legendary armor is not very hard to get , comparatively. That said , the stat swapping is the only real benefit. It doesn't have a unique skin like the pve legendary raid armors do.
---
4.) reaper is not the preferred spec for basically anything , except soloing around. Scourge is.
---
5.) I'm not sure enough of what you want here , to answer.
---
I hear Guardian is simple but strong. Also pretty new, returning after years away. Trying to main an Engineer but there's a lot of options/kits/skills to rotate through. Maybe not an ideal starting class ^.^
---
I personally use accuracy sigil in my GS. I figure its the weapon Im spending most of my nonshroud time in. Inside shroud I have the usual sigils in my axe. It makes it annoying as I lose 3/10% if I ever get caught in GS shroud. However, outside shroud, you gain DPS by being that much closer to 100% crit. 
---
I havent fully trialled it to see how stable the rotation is, ie. how well I can actually make sure I shroud only while on the axe set.
---
So as a fresh 80 noob how would I go about joining in on this event? I can’t tell where world bosses are or how they spawn and such ..
---
holy shit, you're not trolling.
---
yes that person has dread and i wouldn't be suprised if other shenanigans, that person doesnt know how to do a rotation and just pressed random, weak skills off cd on all weapons and then goes to shroud without any strategy.
---
and no, spotter and sun spirit are not standard buffs anymore since druid has fallen out of meta, you play with slb, ren and warrior in pt/squad so you take banners, ea, frost spirit, assassin's precision
---
I have a good 13 but I only play about 4 regulary.
---
That's some big recoil.
---
Perfect for ranged Deimos strat!
---
Added on discord and sent you a private message on reddit, welcome to the community, hoping you have a lot of fun! :D
---
TBH, the only meta that I found fun in HoT was Verdant Brink, and nobody does that one more than just to kill the Matriarch who is also the most brain dead of the 5 canopy bosses.
---
Chaek Gerent is a single boss that is pretty poorly designed that has two attacks, and a series of 4 really pointless pre-events of which only Nuhoch lane is kind of fun to do. I already find Junundu rising to be more fun than Chak Gerent ever was, just the rewards that are lack luster.
---
I would love to see the events toned up and made more interesting, but I think the HoT metas have been placed on a pedestal that they don't actually deserve.
---
you're going to lose dps this way and also initial burst dmg. in shroud you are capped on crit anyway so just pack all the damage you possibly can there - in shroud you deal most of your damage. thats why i also modified the rotation a bit to go to shroud more often. the longer you prolong the time outside shroud, the more dps you're losing (but you still have to exit shroud to renew soul barbs)
---
i tried benchmarks with eagle runes + assassin pieces, with scholar + assassin. pure zerk+scholar was always coming out as better

So 
---
Berserkers is: ++Power, +Precision, +Ferocity
---
Assassins is: +Power, ++Precision, +Ferocity
---
Both sets of armour give the same total Ferocity, so that's literally out of the equation, it doesn't change.
---
[Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup:](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Sweet_and_Spicy_Butternut_Squash_Soup) 100 Power, 70 Ferocity
---
[Bowl of Curry Butternut Squash Soup:](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Curry_Butternut_Squash_Soup) 100 Precision, 70 Ferocity
---
Both types of food also give the same amount of Ferocity, so Ferocity is still out of the equation for stat changes.
---
Dunno where the fuck you're getting your idea from, but the only thing that changes is having 100 more of either stat on your armour vs. having it in your food. One is cheaper than the other, one requires armour swapping if you have spotter or not.
---
Look at the score. Look at how ahead we are and how relevant conserving cool downs is.
---
Seems more unlucky to me that you feel like having fun in a game isn't enough excuse to do something.
---
For Auric Basin you just need to loot one Grand chest, no need to do the actual event. Just find a map that has done it, they are usually in lfg even in non-peak times (at least on EU).
---
For VB you need to kill one of the night bosses. Most people just go for Matriarch as it often takes &lt;1min to kill.
---
3 gold profit / day, the only challenge is to remember to go to the maps at specific times.
---
oh, didn't know that, thanks a lot for the info
---
I have 10 slots, 1 for each class and 1 key farmer. I main Warrior, so I use it everywhere in every game mode, but I've been using my Revenant in fractals and WvW more lately. I also use my Mesmer and Ranger in fractals and raids sometimes, but that's about it.
---
Yeah, but it hurts anet, in that it adds two events at once, instead of drawing out the engagement of players.  They can get a month of engagement from episode 6, and then a couple of weeks of the meta event (even if it's a week long, the pof updates *should* help that)
---
No they can patch it in with the finale and switch it on when they feel is the right time like they did with SAB, like the did with this weeks event. They don't need to put the event on as soon as its patched in.
---
I tried buying gems Thursday night 4 times. Never worked. Tried again Friday night and it worked.
---
Spend an hour or two looking at snowcrows guides, videos and closely mimic their rotation at a raid training golem. After that try getting within or close to 90% of their benchmark. If you can do that and you're still struggling on story / open world bosses or really any content at all I'll gladly help you out on whatever you need.
---
Give it a shot even if you don't find it particularly enjoyable. 2 hrs in exchange for making almost all content more smooth and not having to struggle to get by every encounter as if you were playing a dark souls game is a small price to pay.
---
Try installing arcdps, a dps meter, as well. It may give you a better understanding of what everyone is talking about and give you a reference as to where you stand and visually see your improvements.
---
If getting better at the game isn't what you have in mind, try setting materialistic goals like getting a shiny skin or infusion. End game is really just what you want it to be. If you don't set goals there really isn't any point in playing, and that kind of goes hand in hand with any game.
---
You no longer need to get into teq early for good maps

Chak Gerent

2) Charges after the CC

3) Tail swipes

4) Swipes with hand claw thingies

5) Sometimes does that little dodge thing.

That's mostly it I think... the boss itself has some moves but the mechanics of the fight itself is eh.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The HoT meta's are way more rewarding, to the point where many more people play it. IMO, HoT has  more structured metas that seem more like the "typical" meta event.
---
In the end HoT meta's were after initial changes, a success compared to PoF's. Whether gameplay is better not is for you to decide but I don't think it's up artificially put on a pedestal above PoF metas without some kind of merit.
---
Huh, good to know. I stopped doing that event about 2 years ago :)
---
Not enough impact on the community, 90% of players will not be affected.
---
As someone who plays exclusively using action camera/combat mode: yeah it’s fucking hell.
---
Like you said, [key farming](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming) is the best way. Otherwise you'd have to do level 40/60 story (even more work) or hope for the ~1/3 chance every map completion (not including cities or southsun). Really just doing the weekly farm is super easy if you follow a guide and can take 10-15 min to do.
---
So I'm trying to understand your post. I get the feeling English may not be your first language, and that's ok.
---
The fact you're building for defensive stats for Open World is the first problem. You're a Warrior. Highest HP scaling and heaviest armor available. You're pretty durable from the start. Unless you're raiding as the tank, Vitality and Toughness aren't particularly useful. Get just enough defensive stats to not get one shot, to be comfortable. With the rest of your stats, maximize your damage. The best defense is the best offense. You won't take damage from dead enemies.
---
With that in mind, check your build. Specializations, Armor Runes, Weapon Sigils. These are all important, they will make or break you. And with all that Condition Damage, I'm hoping you're a Sword/Torch and Longbow Berzerker. That's the only usable Condition Warrior build.
---
Secondly, there is substantially less gear grind in GW2 compared to other MMOs. The difference between Ascended and Exotic gear is 6%. Yes, there's a statistical benefit to Ascended but it's not strictly required. It's totally possible to have gotten Ascended gear at Launch that is still perfectly optimal. 
---
That brings me to my next point. You're not supposed to improve your gear. You're supposed improve your own gameplay. It is completely intentional you don't have infinite stamina for dodges or strong self-sustain. Guild Wars 2 extremely dynamic in it's combat. If you facetank, you're gonna have a bad time. Watch out for enemy animations, that'll tell you when to dodge. Getting melted by Conditions? Slot Cleanses in your utilities. Still need mobility? Get mobility utilities like Charge.
---
You have everything you need to be successful. You just need to choose to be better.
---
Make all surfaces slippery for extra "fun"
---
Autoattack 10 second CD week?
---
I don't remember the exact specifics or the patch that fixed them, but: 
---
On launch, Heart of Thorns Meta events didn't feel as rewarding and each had one or two problems that either made the experience tedious or overly difficult. 
---
A few patches later, a patch came out that both made the events slightly more forgiveable and buffed rewards by a substantial amount, including the addition of a daily chest with significant rewards inside.
---
Tequatl gives at minimum two gold, not at most.  You're guaranteed 2 gold in liquid cash for beating it, and then you get all the extra items (including at least three rares) on top of that.
---
3 rares on avg. is still worth less than 60 silver in total. I don't think it's worth the time.
---
just like with the alienware promotion. People get so much free stuff and still whined...
---
I'm sorry, I'm trying to figure out what you're getting at. 
---
You're telling us that you run a Condition Berzerker, and can't stay alive. Ergo, even while Toughness and Vitality are fairly usless in PvE, Dire fits your needs almost ideally. And to make things better, you already have the Dire gear in your bank?
---
But you're not going to use it because your weapons have cleave and AoE..? I'm speechless.
---
And that's fine, was mainly correcting the gold amount.
---
It winds up being a little different in practice because Tequatl is one of the few places where the game generates a good amount of gold out of nothing as a reward, similar to Fractals.  In the HoT/PoF metas, while there can be good money to be made from them, that money is made via the Trading Post selling Amalgamated Gemstones/Intact Mosaics/Zehtuka recipes, so it actually removes gold from the economy via taxes rather than introducing new gold...
---
Wait, wait, wait. You can't beat a level 3 "boss"..? You don't even have to hit any buttons after your auto attack. You get in melee, hit 1, and the game wins for you. I hope you start streaming, I would be fascinated to watch.
---
Engineer main, so....all of them?
---
Are there any keys that can be received just by achieving a level?
---
I will recheck the weekly farm, maybe i can substitute some other secondary objectives for this, although   sometimes I don't even achieve my primary weekly objectives, therefore my lazy questions.
---
My knowledge of the game is very uneven, and then we get updates and then I forget something else, thank the six gods for the wiki.
---
But you don't need either, he's a level 3 boss. You don't need to Blind, or Dodge, and there is no way you need to "kite" him. 
---
And to be clear, every mission can be soloed by Berzerker. Many missions cannot be soloed by you.
---
Luckily they don't seem to know the concept of reflects and die to their own nuke while I chill behind my axe 5 (double axe boon beast). And even if they menage to interrupt their rapid fire fast enough I laugh about most of them.
---
Still an active community after all these years :)
---
It is hard giving exact numbers for fractals since it depends on how fast your group is too. Some chronos pre stack boons then just swap to full DPS builds in good groups with short fights. With better groups 15% is fine but if you want to throw on a couple more diviner pieces you can (raids for example runs with 20% from 2x ring + accessory). The dT guide also says to swap out as much berserker as you need to keep boons up but again you don't need much duration. The 60-100% suggestion is definitely not needed and you would lose a descent amount of damage.
---
Having 8 stacks of all condis also can slightly adjust when the golem dies to line up on your burst, which honestly is probably irrelevant because he is pressing essentially random skills and being carried by Dread.
---
Old events: Yes, especially with [these](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-world-boss-beatdown/) events [coming](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/75132/upcoming-bonus-events) up.
---
WvW is busy this week due to this [current event](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/starting-today-world-vs-world-weeklong-bonus/).
---
PvP is fine.  Balance patches have been helping a little, but it could use more love.
---
All the raids are done every week by most dedicated groups.
---
Note the disclaimer on the build:
---
&gt; If you are unable to provide enough  Quickness with that, please swap Berserker items for Diviner until you reach 100%  Quickness uptime on the group.
---
Partly, it may be that the build doesn't assume you actually need 100% uptime, but only enough to last until you burst down the boss. It might also be more geared towards players who have higher than 150 AR for the bonus stats. More likely, though, the build assumes most players will need some Diviners but don't want to specify a particular amount.
---
More specifically and most importantly day was decoupled from night. It used to be you'd have a big advantage in 3 hot zones by doing all the day events, which some of us preferred (mostly those with no life lol). Now, with the day and night seperated, you can rock up at the end, get your reward with very little time spent. Great for most people probably.
---
Also a couple of champs were turned into vets, many veteran only events were added and some of the density of creatures along certain paths was culled. 
---
The problem with PoF is completely different from the problems with HoT. Hot was considered too hard, too grindy, too confusing. It needed too much time to invest.
---
PoF is considered too easy to accomplish goals and not rewarding enough. The truth is HoT was always rewarding but you had to work harder for that reward than it is now. They didn't really need to buff the rewards for HoT metas much. The patch was mostly about making the experience more accessible to casual/solo players.
---
PoF has a completely different set of problems, the biggest being the rewards can't compare to HOT metas.
---
I didn't notice the # of condi's. Fair point. Is the half second of warhorn 5's cast time that bad that it's not even worth using even if it is a siphon effect?
---
Don't know why they needed to change Locust Swarm it was good as it was. 
---
I also feel like the change of focus 4 didn't add much of value, they shouldn't have made this based around life siphon which usually scales poorly compared other skills (another problem of necro). And who thought it was a good idea to 
---
use the slow as fk moving hand projectile from the staff for this ... with the old one at least I could tag more targets.
---
Staff or greatsword on Necro are just so flawed in their concept that simply playing around with numbers cant fixed them, but we all now that they probably never give them a complete rework from the ground up.
---
I've done so. I have the misfortune of having to work when most people play, so I'll literally never be online that one time when you can actually get a group together during prime time. Instead, just as most people are logging on to play, I'd have just logged off to get to work.
---
When I'm playing metas just don't happen. Even if I scour lfg.
---
Story (going through in story order, catching up to current). I have just gotten to the beginning of PoF.
---
Map completion. I'm at 98% on my main, so this is almost done.
---
Mastery hunting. At around 110 points at the moment, plenty more to go. Core tyria points are getting harder to get.
---
Dailies, especially when I can get some map completion done at the same time. Gets me some gold, some spirit shards, some AP, and injects some variety.
---
I don't hate Mirage because they're OP, I hate them because they're a troll anti-fun class. Good Mirages ruin unranked PvP games &gt;:(

Instinct kicked in and I sort of kicked the bear away to stop anyone else from killing it. I was sort of scolding everyone about killing wildlife during our walk.
---
For question 1, it depends what you are willing to do. If you join a HP train, there will usually be a mesmer to port you to all the places you can't get to yet. Anything you do yourself will be a lot easier with a springer with the high jump mastery. However to 100% HoT maps, you \*will need\* the Itzel Poison Lore and exalted acceptance mastery. Not even a mesmer portal and a group carrying you will get you the chak stronghold HP without the poison mastery. Other than that, advanced gliding will help a lot.
---
I tried it once but after crafting few items I had hard time to actually sell them. They may have good prices but demand for them is pretty low.
---
Jokes on you, as a scrapper, I have mirages for breakfast.

So pmuch it was very strong when backstab was spammable and ghost thief was a thing. Like backstab, stealth then backstab. Stealth from steal then backstab again repeat.

---
nothing wrong with it if you are just doing open world stuff.   I liked it more when focus 4 was a bouncing blind
---
I learned so many new things from this already.
---
Check out [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Engineer) for some builds, but for open world it comes down to what you want personally. 
---
I like to play with the skills and traits, especially as a long time player when simple things like dodging and avoiding damage are second nature, I can run more risky traits and skills. 
---
What I recommend is starting with a build you see on a website, and tweaking it to your standards and playstyle. Maybe you like pistol offhand more than shield, or maybe you feel like you need to have more defense and run a more tanky traitline like inventions or alchemy. Maybe all you need to change is adding a stunbreaker on your skill bar. Best spot for open world builds usually are glassy but have some utility to get out of tight situations.
---
Mind if I use this or another track from the album in a youtube video? Id be more than happy to have a link and give credit ofc. Been thinking about getting back into making some wvw videos and this music would be perfect!
---
The real quality advice for preventing burnout right here.
---
They can go together, but it isn't as effective as Axe/Torch or Sword/Focus. Focus is primarily a power, utility, and defense weapon, whereas Axe is a condition focused damage weapon. If you are with friends, doing open world stuff, or things you know you can do like T1 and T2 fractals, by all means, rock those legendaries, but for the harder stuff like T4 fractals, raids, and in (possibly) WvW, you're gonna want to optimize to your builds strengths.
---
Get the dx12 plugin and make your life easier
---
The combination mixes damage types, which is generally bad. Axe is a condition damage weapon, while focus does no conditions (aside from burning procced by F1 passive), and the block thing is overkill for Firebrand since your heal gives aegis.  
---
It's sub-optimal at high level, but I'm sure you could make a reasonable build with mixed condition/power that would work fine.
---

When's the friendly fire raid event?
---
Sweet thanks! Will do. It will probably be some time before I get around to making the vid. Life is crazy right now, but I always had fun making them in the past so I have been wanting to start again. I'll be sure to let you know :) Amazing work btw!
---
Hybrid Power Quickbrand is actually meta in Fractals right now, it uses Axe/Focus as CC and Fury option together with GS burst. I currently play it mostly with Scepter for range and higher DPS in open world, but going Axe ist totally fine ;)
---
2 days into this game, after playing gw1 factions back when it was released in my middle school days. Definitely down to get the expansions, but is that a reputable site for purchase? Always wary of sketchy shit with third party digital sales.
---
Also wondering if the extra gem package deal straight from arenanet would be worth it..
---
And that's exactly how the mad tribulation cloud appeared in that reality. A bug in the box, created by a girl who didn't want to jump.
---
druid did fall out of meta long ago. in this patch it was just completely killed. also wrong, a patch may decide on what is suddenly new meta, wtf
---
They're all proper world bosses, as are Eye of Zhaitan (the one in Straits of Devastation), Rhendak the Crazed, the Champion Devourer Queen, and the Assault on Nebo Terrace.  They don't have a schedule, though, with player activity being key to trigger their spawn conditions, so you can't plan to fight them at a certain time like with the scheduled world bosses.  As a result, they aren't done as frequently.
---
Once a day thing like the normal chests.  So get out and fight the bosses off the beaten path that you don't normally fight too!
---
I had forgotten that it existed, thanks for reminding :D
---
Tryed it. Can confirm. FPS is much more stable (and higher) with the slider on. Actually I have the same performance as on windows now, and that's nice. Reshade support would be fantastic now.
---
Bout. Damn. Time.
---
The infusions in the box is something easy to point at , but I think these mini events show a fucking great re-dedication to actually DOING something to increase player engagement. They are fun little theme things every once in a while ( apparently ) with rewards that look like they'll be balanced between too much and too little , and more importantly , get people interested and grouping more to have fun together.
---
"Collections and meta achievements with titles"
---
As long as you guys are thinking about it, I'm just going to throw this out there.  There should be collections for unlocking all skins/minis/etc from a raid wing.
---
I dont know what "MM" and "pahua" means but for example on a Thief you can take daredevil for an extra dodge or the trait "Invigorating precision" in combination with your healing signet for insane healing.
---
I have multiples of each class, at last count I think I have 36 or 38 or so.
---
I am hopeless at playing mesmer and thief, and I need to be carried while playing warrior, but fairly decent at most of the others.
---
Nothing is server bound. Your gold/currency in general is account bound, ascended equipment and general use stuff are mostly account bound. The only things that I can think of that are soulbound are specific leveling rewards as well as equipment below Ascended quality that are usually soulbound on equip.
---
clean d912pxy folder and check for extra things you using like launchbuddy or reshade, or even rtss/other things
---
Useful, cheers!
---
Wait, I'm living proof too.
---
Seems like a lot of effort, more playing for the grind than for fun.
---
Those 2 wont even save you. A proper longbow burst would be unblockable and once you start casting a channeled skill, it will follow the target even if it goes into stealth. 
---
I even got killed from the mount while dodging 3 of rapid fire hits. Luckily it's rare to see a soulbeast that knows how to minmax the damage output. Most of them just press 2 and sick em.
---
Depending on the group 15% may be a bit low (if phases are longer) but 60% is probably on the verge of overkill given that the Condi Quickbrand with Rune of the Firebrand can maintain Quickness with no issue outside of fractals with "only" 40% Quickness duration.
---
For groups that have very good DPS and know how to prestack (give big chunks of boons near the mistlock and reset your CDs with it) 15% is enough but not everybody is in that spot.
---
I would suggest you try it out on the training golem by simulating 15% boon duration (without caring about DPS) and see how it feels. If you feel unsure, add some boon duration until you feel fine on the golem. Once you are fine, add an extra 5% just in case because you are not in an ideal situation and see how it goes in a real T4 situation. When you are confortable enough work your way back to 15% at your own pace.
---
I recently switched to shadow arts for my PvP build. Granted, I'm not a particularily good PvP player, but it's quite fun because it allows for some stealth shenanigans. I'm not at my PC right now so I can't tell you what exactly I picked, but a few traits that come to my mind are "+1 sec. to invisibility every time you stealth", say you gain stealth 5 times in a fight (which is pretty easy to do) thats an extra 5 seconds of invisibility. Pretty neat. Also, steal 2 boons from your enemy whenever you strike them with a stealth attack. With how often you can stealth that's a nice bonus to have.
---
Again, I'm not a good player and before I switched to shadow arts I always died pretty quickly, but now I can disengage fight's I'm about to lose fairly easily.
---
Scourge only weekend
---
With the mounts in HoT...I kinda feel like the Springer ruins it a bit. Fine for repeating but half of the challenge of HoT maps is figuring out how to get places. It's suppose to be a maze. The Springer bypasses a lot of that.
---
I play support/healer scourge in PvP and can 1v1 mirage unless They really catch me off guard or with everything on cooldown.
---
It looks something like this..  https://i.imgur.com/ZroaI5g.jpg
---
how about this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU7lY04yyiw
---
We are also getting another event after that a few weeks later, which they state meta events will not have a daily cap on them for the time being.
---
I was kind of hoping he'd pull out Predator and there would be sound
---
Good company makes many things more enjoyable. Most content we've seen in gw2 is solo content. No need for organized parties or squads to complete them like in original HoT maps. One reason I play less than before.
---
Depends what for, but it's pretty meta at the moment anyway. I use my guard for open world with axe/focus and it's great because I've got that extra emergency block on 5, and loads of CC.
---
Hi, you could always try that [configuration](https://imgur.com/DAey3n9) with that old script I wrote in that [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6wc0wi/action_camera_and_rebinding_left_and_right_mouse/).
---
IIRC you can just delete the extra hotkey if you don't need them to move your mouse.
---
No offence to the french, but I see mirage as the kind of person who'd make silly gestures in front of their screen, and if GW2 had voicechat would mock their opponent:
---
"Peut-être que je suis une illusion?", "&lt;Laugh&gt; Vous ne pouvez pas me faire de mal!" Can anyone confirm they play mirage like that?
---
Right on the week I'm on holidays. Crap :(
---
Everything is removed and clean :/ I will use hook again for now sadly I'll try to reinstall the game
---
Rift fizzling or not is not entirely random. For example, I've never seen rift fizzling if no player is in it's radius when the rift forms; meaning that probably the rift failing is due to the hidden decorations (trees in Shiverpeaks rifts, parts of the wall in Ascalon rifts and so on) trying to pop in, and taking the same spot as character entity, failing the process and making the rift fizzle out. You can almost reliably fail the rift by standing directly in place where rift spawns, for example.
---
I've been waiting for that hat too. It was in last March's sale, so I had hoped it would pop up this year, but no dice. I keep seeing random skins in the store popping up, so maybe we'll get it soon.
---
Imagen anomaly every 2h, that's 12 mystic coins per day :P
---
I play one for 90% of the time, and have some logic along with it.
---
I personally dislike how alt-friendly this game is, because it takes pride away from having a character with a lot on their belt. Also it makes sure people flock to what is best instead of utilizing their options of the character they play (which there always are)
---
Few people seem to agree with me and most people even argue the opposite but hey :)

Beyond "Playing against Mirage"
---
&gt; Suffering from Bursts of Aggression
---
I am not really sure what your issue is but the Open world content if super easy for most players. GW2 is about footwork and dps. DPS then dodge the damage. Don't stand in the red circles. I mean it almost doesn't matter what stat gear you use defensive or offensive, that just sets up for how long its gonna take to kill things. 
---
You are actually putting runes on your gear? You have actually upgraded your armor and weapons? You aren't still using the starter stuff, right? 
---
The game is not going to change, its guild wars 2 not WoW or something else. The basic mechanics will always be the same, the graphics always similar. That's pretty much how games work. 
---
I took like 11 characters through all of the game's content, some professions its more difficult than others, but that's a stretch because most of the content is silly easy. 
---
Maybe watch some gameplay and build videos and you can see what other people do?
---
My main is a Mirage. I suddenly become french when I kill someone.
---
I'm amazed how many people fall for your trolling. Solo lupi but unable to do the lv 10 story. Don't you think that was a bit too obvious?
---
Are people just so detached that they don't think having half the team fired is gonna impact dev cycle times? Found this same entitled shitpost on the forum post itself. I have to wonder if the SJW's were right and that gamers as a wider subculture are just predisposed to be  basement dwellers detached from the real world and how it works...
---
Like. are you absolutely serious with this entitlement? really dude?
---
Everyone will have their subjective opinion about every class and be biased towards their favorite one. Add different game modes and playstyles. So just imagine list of all classes, other answers are not necessary.
---
I doubt they'll bring back multiloot since the nerf to multiloot didn't pertain to daily rewards. It was in relation to being able to loot multiple instances each time the meta was done so you'd get five to ten times the reward you'd normally get depending on how good your load times were.
---
It seems more likely that they'll just remove the daily limit on the Hero's Choice chests you receive when you complete the meta. Might be interesting for people looking to farm amalgamated gemstones for Gen 2 legendaries.
---
that would be great to make gold or sace gold if you are crafting a legendary

Most boring class is Ranger. No matter if it's core, druid or soulbeast. This class is so easy that my mother could handle it and become a good player in GW2 (she don't know what is a MMORPG). I had to get 80 lvl on every class and master all specs for achivements and collections. Typical gameplay of a ranger is:
---
1. Make sure you have enabled an autoatack.
---
2. Make sure your pet will attack the enemies.
---
3. Press "1".
---
4. Cross your arms and wait for enemy to die.
---
Oh yes the simple days of stopping an undead abomination made up of the corpses of dragons that has infiltrated basically every organisation in Tyria and commands an army of former allies.
---
In my experience all you really need is a stunbreak because they will use their knockback right into rapid fire so as long as you can instanly stunbreak the knockback you can dodge the rapid fire. This does not mean you already won the fight but it can take their opening advantage from them quite easily.
---
I play thief, and only thief. All different variations on the scale of power, condi, daredevil and deadeye, based on what's needed for the content I play(which is mostly raids)
---
The problem with these buffs is, that they give you very inconsistent dmg.
---
I had one try, where almost everything critted, and ended up higher than subli (33,2k), but I also got even more tries, where a lot of skills didn't crit.
---
Especially gravedigger.
---
And that's a huge DPS loss. And let me end up on 29k again.
---
So to get a real benchmark we'd have to take like 50attempts add them all together and divide by 50, to get the real DPS potential.
---
If you're good at gambling, you should definitely try reaper!
---
Or you can take Coolant Blast as a heal, so you have condi cleanse on F1. Main problem with this skill is converting everything to burning...
---
Complete noob here; what's the go-to control scheme? I'm starting off with ranger since it seemed like the easiest to learn with auto aiming skill spamming and not relying heavily on movement before endgame, giving me a chance to learn...but movement in combat feels clunky as fuuuuu
---
Is there something I'm missing? Right now I've left controls default, relying on right click and drag to reorient myself during combat but I really can't get a hang of greatswords/swords/dagger constant moving. YouTubers tend to be able to handle all that so much better and make it look so easy.
---
Is it all just git gud? If so I'll be working on it, but if I'm missing something obvious it'd be nice to know before forming bad habits
---
How is 5 spirit druid fun to play?
---
Pewpew/boonbeast? It's one or the other. The so-called "boonbeast" builds rarely use the bow.
---
Ppl getting banned for botting syncing etc. anet bans via Hardware Id and if u run a bot on the same machine as your main good luck to you buddy. Anet is right, guild wars 1 is a mess, it turned into bot wars over all these years, just ban all these stupid botters. Their system is 100% accurate it has been proven in the past, you won’t get banned for nothing, fact. Move on kiddo.... you don’t need a ded duped panda for 1700a don’t you ?
---
I'm more into PvE. Solo open world, fractals with some friends, I will start raiding soon.
---
By too simple I mean warrior for example : it's really straightforward, no fancy tricks in his book.
---
By too "spammy" (and not "complex") I mean weaver : a lot of clicks for the same result as other classes... to be honest, it tires my hand a lot during boss fights. I just feel like spamming all my best dps spells in the rotation's order, more muscle memory than anything complex.

Yes.

Rebinding a and d to strafe instead of turn is all I have changed.

It might also just be a learning curve. I have played MMOs with this controls scheme since I was just 7 or 8 years old. I probably struggled learning it aswell.

I wouldn't mind them if many achievements and dailies weren't locked behind them D:

GW2 World Bosses are back on the menu.

I can hardly add something I known nothing about do I? It would be in the guide in the first place. If you wanna help then stop bitching like random Karen in McDonald's and make good looking structured list of flaws what I can copy to pinned post. 🙄
---
Well, the question is if it's unblockable for x seconds or x hits.. So 3 hits out of the 15(!?) rapid fire shots go through? Well okay I get some hits you get the rest ;)
---
Its a great guide with extremely good production value. Sweet visual editing, great structure and easy to understand.
---
To me it looke like you just want to hate. This guide will help people way more than no guide ever existing i am absolutely certain of this and i can't even see how you can pretend to be so blind that you can't see that.

Well first of all there's no esport scene in Guild Wars 2 but if your sole interest is to get to high rank you can easly do it with a core build, you just have to be good, matter of fact there's a lot of core players in the top 100.
---
I would see if any of the [fractal builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) stick out to you (builds still need to be updated from last patch, warrior will most likely switch to berserker). I think I would suggest [soulbeast](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) or [dragonhunter](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter)/[firebrand](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) (power firebrand provides quickness to groups while having the same gear as DH).
---
For me ( fun to boring), noted that I played some of these profession in raid/fotm but I still give my honest opinion about druid being boring, it used to be my 2nd role in raid aside from dps.

Good production values doesnt mean anything when the information you give is wrong. Thats what makes me hate all his guides, he has wrong information in almost all of them

Sorry m8, no idea what you're talking about.

Hello, 
---
Not sure if this belongs here but I recently joined up on Guild wars 2 and was wondering if anyone had a guild I'd be welcome to join? I'm looking for a guild on the European servers which is social and relaxed with the potential for future raids once I've learned the game. If you have a Discord that'd be cool too.
---

Hard to tell without official confirmation and without pooling data from many many players. I assume rngesus has just been kind to you, so congrats :D
---
It was told to you multiple times even in the raid thread where you posted it. You were also in the reddit thread where people mathematically proved that the desmina tanking thing is wrong.
---
I HAVE given you a list in the past and you did NOTHING about it.
---
I'm playing minstrel fb in wvw and viper everywhere else.. Condi fb is for me the most fun class to play with
---
Never buy from sites that aren't [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-digital) like DLGamer is. 
---
The way I look at the bundle is that gems never go on sale or have reduced cost so 4000 gems = $50. If you're buying the $80 pack - $50 of gems you're paying full price of $30 (+$20 HoT) and getting the bonus content: [Character slot](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Character_Slot_Expansion) (800 gems / $10), [Lily of the Elon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lily_of_the_Elon) lounge pass (only from the pack but other lounges go for 1000 gems / $12.50), [sunspear outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunspear_Outfit) (again exclusive but usually 700 gems  / $8.75) not my favorite outfit though..., [Identity repair kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Identity_Repair_Kit) (1000 gems / $12.50). 
---
So all together you're spending $50 on the pack instead of $25 on sale or $38 on DLGamer so you just have to judge if you personally think the bonus content is worth it. You can buy gems at any point so don't consider them "discounted" since they never are they are just throwing in some freebies to sweeten the deal. I think the best thing by far in the pack is the character slot and the other things aren't worth a lot (should also consider that they do put gem store items on sale).
---
well I think micromanaging is a huge point in guild wars 2 and guild wars 1 aswell, and many other mmos too. if you dont want things like these you should play an action or adventure game like zelda, where you just go as you are without hazzling with your inventory and trying to get the best out of any situation. and the thing for guild wars 2 at least, is that there are so many microoptimizations that can be done for speedrun, but are not necessary in any part of the game, which is great I think
---
I feel like your opinion might change after understanding how to do some of the proper rotations.
---
I am assuming you are playing in open world where everything works and pressing buttons randomly is enough most of the time. Learning how to combo them changes the gameplay pretty dramatically. For example you definitely can spam gravedigger on reaper after 50% and do relatively ok. Or you can learn how to use all your weapon skills and vastly improve the result. This applies to most other classes.
---

Sorry I don't remember. Notifications are finicky so I often miss some comments since I have to react across multiple platforms. Just make it again send me those lists in pm here so I won't miss it.
---
I think the premise of the stealth traits in Shadow Arts is that you are being dealt damage or you trying to avoid damage in stealth. In that it does okay I think; auto-stealth on low health, you cannot be critically hit in stealth, 33% reduced damage in stealth, run 50% faster in stealth, remove conditions and heal in stealth etc. Its just that you are usually not taking heavy damage in stealth, so most of those traits are wasted. If they extend the effects of some of these traits to Revealed or if the effects linger for a bit after stealth as well, then they might see some general use as Revealed/post stealth is usually when Thief is at their most vulnerable. 
---
Shadow Arts also has pretty strong traits for rezzing. With Shadow Arts you can stealth an ally and yourself when rezzing, rez faster, and give 33% reduced damage to allies in stealth. Stealth on downed allies is really good as it stops anyone from stomping them, and the reduced damage that goes with it helps a lot if someone is trying to cleave.
---
dude, i've like 2k spirit shards and never used it lol
---
maybe a good idea :)
---
PoF has map METAs!?
---
You're not meant to spam 12345 to kill mobs. I mean, it works, because in open world mobs are pushovers, but to get a better gameplay experience try to first look into what each ability does. For example, greatsword 2 does quite a lot of damage compared to simply autoattacking (111 chain), so you will want to use that off cooldown. If you read greatsword (gs) 5's description, it tells you that it will also refresh you gs 2 skill. So you have the following combo: gs2-&gt;gs5-&gt;gs2 all in quick succession for a nice burst. These skills will barely move you from where you're standing as well. Now let's look at gs3 and 4. Gs3 damage isn't all that impressive, taken how long the cast time is compared to autoattacking, BUT it can make you close gaps very quickly, so save that skill for moving around the map or to close in on enemies that are running away. Gs4 on the other hand is a blocking ability, so use it when you know when you're about to get hit to mitigate damage.
---
For the other weapons, see for yourself what each skill's purpose is, as it'll be a more enjoyable and enlightening experiment than if I were to write a paragraph for each. As a rule of thumb: you generally don't burn through your skills cooldowns without any reason, to get the most out of each weapon see if they fit the role you want them for in the first placeand then use what is appropiate (bursting down, disengaging, kiting...).
---
Tekkits guides are the best **by far** we have in this game even if he doesn't have every detail perfect. That desmina guide? There is nothing even close to it on YouTube even if the middle thing doesn't matter. Whats important is that you can get an understanding of the bosses mechanics before you join a training raid. You can absolutely be respectful and helpful in pointing out things you would add or change. Thats a good thing.
---
But  it matters how you do it. They way you are behaving is like a kid throwing a tantrum.
---
Must not also have the warclaw either. Missing 2 keybinds without them. The radial Mount wheel is such a better experience than having 7 mount keybind keys.
---
Aye aye capt.... Captain!
---
Fractal 42 farming group.
---
Serpent's Ire probably one of the hardest meta-events just having a commander tag won't probably make it.
---
Well i have to admit it comes down to raid mechanics. Since I play druid only in raids and i kinda like the different tasks druids normally do in raid encounters.
---
If you have just started looking at PvP don't just get hung up on builds. The god of PvP website OP linked will also explain map mechanics and give a general idea of how they work.
---
Succeeding in PvP isn't just about running in and swiping your sword at the enemy you kinda need to know where you should be and shouldn't be as well, so make sure you understand that at a basic level.
---
I never said I was good... If i'm condi I usually just wait for a straggler then throw everything I have on them and run away. It works sometimes. I'm terrible at any pvp though.
---
Yeah, I doubt that.
---
ArenaNet prevents you from logging into the game when you are banned and I pretty much doubt they use IP bans for the exact reason.
---
Also if you disconnected from the game you get usually thrown to the character screen. When your account gets banned you sit in the launcher with the message of not being able to login.
---
builds that focus on reviving? good joke
---
Awesome ty!
---
because I have been respectful in the past, many times. And instead of actually taking my criticism to heart he ignores it and keeps making terrible guides with objectively false information. I have been telling him to fix his damn guides since he made the Sabetha one YEARS AGO. And, as is evident in this guide, he STILL does this.
---
Tekkit might make great guides for open world farming etc, but his raid guides are not good in the slightest.
---
so by removing stuff from game you creating *event*? ok.
---
Excellent tips, thanks! Open world mobs are very much trash, so I've tended to stick with axe/warhorn combo in case there's something with a bit more sponginess that my pet can get a bit of a buff with axe 3 and their f2 ability
---
You have very limited classes and builds to play with, but yes.
---
Even if I do this, which would require for me to watch each one of your guides with a notepad in hand, should I keep doing it for every guide you do in the future?
---
Do you not see how blind hate has driven you crazy? Read your comments again as if you didn't write them.
---
[I don't want to mean but. . .](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+radial+mount+menu)
---
The best 'improve gameplay' is changing counter builds to mobs, yea, I have done this on HOT, using reflection and cc skills to kill veteran brickback or full brust to blood sucker. And a lot of forged/awakened spawns in same time is counter to PPF gear warrior too. 
---
And do not mind the heavy armor and 19000 health, warrior on the 1st line of glass cannon now, zerker build is not tougher than thief, yes!
---
And actually, on 2014 or earilier, grinding is a miserable problem for MMOs, GW2 used to be surprised. But for now, everything changed, MMORPG is declining, and almost vast majority of them changed grinding, to a simplier and casual way. On the contrast, GW2's gearing style let me feel restricted, and boring (same gear stat for many years, new map means nothing).
---
This is false. They dropped 2 unannounced projects, but they're still working at least on another one.
---
Maybe the game just isn't for you. I have played non stop for over 6 years. Yes I agree there are some times that content seems a bit lacking and guildies play less, but there is always something I can get on with, whether it's finishing a collection or joining metas
---
Yes, I am absolutely crazy for being tired of constantly pointing out wrong information in his guides. Cool story.
---

Mainly warrior, but having all 80 toons, this is why I can say warrior is squishy.

thief, warrior, guardian are most squishist class on open map

Wvw is still fairly active, especially in higher tiers. Build cost depends on class and purpose. Power builds are generally cheaper than condi/support ones.

Hah i guess you wouldn't get this far if you had any ammount of self reflection.
---
The first thing that came to my mind was Tyler1 machine gun sound lol.
---
They don't describe the same effect thought:
---
&gt;Aura: "[…] if they attack you."
---
&gt;Shield: "[…] if you are hit."
---
Getting hit and getting attacked isn't the same even in theory, since the first should proc even if they have blind on them, while the second shouldn't to name just one example. 
---
The fact that both descriptions don't quite match their effect on the other hand…

we have that weekly supply pack that would imply that when we receive the last pack is when the patch will drop

Meta Questions:
---
1) Is AB the best meta event in terms of HoT xp farming?
---
2) What is the best PoF meta event in terms of xp farming?
---
3) What are the best meta events for making money?
---
4) What is the method of making money from the aforementioned?

i used to pvp, and i went through this same thing when fighting mesmers. wanna know what i did? i learned mesmer
---
if you hate burst builds, then you're not a good bunker. maybe try a different class to bunker with?
---
Don’t you know? The new class everyone is crying about is berserker.
---
Even though they die in literal 10 seconds from condi
---
I have recently played through every story mission and completed every map as a berserker warrior. It was extremely easy almost always. It sounds like you just need more practice in playing warrior. Also make sure you have exotic level 80 gear, which is easy to obtain.
---
It wasn't mentioned, I took the opportunity to remind them some of us still remember them fundly.
---
Using them to open envelopes or other boxes which get affected by mf, or just for the old way on getting better loot.

I'm not blindly listening on what is standard but to compare between patches at BASE you should be using the same things between patches. Without a base line you're not comparing you're contrasting.

And that is your right, that doesn't make them proper Content to me, and I know many people feel the same way. It's just not many are vocal aboyt it especially in this social media driven witch hunt society.
---
I do this with Rox's quiver, I have to have the brown in my armor somewhere or it just looks so out of place.
---
I really wish they would either a) make backpacks dyeable or b) at least make them a color consistent with current dyes (Rox, for instance, has no perfect match with the current dyes).
---
Hehe, that's what I've got too.. slightly differende keybinds but also got griffon on Shift + G and haven't bound Warclaw yet.. will need to come up with something for Skyscale too.
---
Anyhow - I tried the Mount Radial and I found that it actually just slowed me down since I'm so used to my keybinds... all credit to the creator for the great UI, but it wasn't for me.
---
Me too
---
yeah will the point is that you need to invest quite some time to convert them into gold and you can also only do so much at once without running out of resources or hitting diminishing returns, I still have like 17k and only burn maybe 2-3k a month
---
well i guess here we are at the very subjective feeling of classes.
---
Berserker is more punishable than they were before the rework. 
---
They're still not good, and you shouldn't allow them to sit around free casting Arc Divider.
---
Thank you. I followed your suggestion and found my sweet spot at 30-35%. I'll work down to 15% from here as I continue to progress.
---
I do decent with guardian, but one thing I learned is that the low base health pool sucked.  I outfitted mine with marauder gear and I can stay alive and actually tank a bit.  I agree with thief and warrior though, but thief is meant to not tank anything - movement is key, gotta go Jackie Chan against harder stuff.
---
You look at the heavy stuff, guard/warrior/rev, and they are all squishy to some degree.  None seem to be meant to be outright tanks from scratch.  There are tradeoffs to builds to either do max DPS or sustain longer.  I'm not the best player out there by a million miles, and what I cant burst I try to outlast so I tilt a little towards sustain on my builds.
---
You can just use a TP to friend to get to Bloodstone and map complete at level 10.

Curse those damn transmutation charges, though.

I doubt they use IP bans when they can just flag your account as terminated. Everyone and their mom would use VPNs to work around bans.

I just use the birthday ones. The laurel ones are like 30 minutes too.

Well if you are willing to I can invite you to my Discord and when I finish scripts for upcoming raid guides, you can do it before I start working on it:-)

If you only consider meta players you also should only consider vets who already have wvw legy gear
---
Sshh... OP clearly HasBrainz so they probably were aware of that ;)
---
I highly doubt theyd ip ban, they simply lock down your account and makes it impossible to login, IP bans are incredibly easy to bypass and would serve no real purpose, I have a feeling you got disconnected and nothing else, or trying to bamboozle us

Firebrand and scrapper are your go to support with necros and revs as your primary source of dps with a few zerks or weavers added.  If you need a good guild there are several guilds on mag that have made it their new home and love to teach new and returning players the new meta.  Feel free to dm me and I can send you a discord with all the information you'll ever need for wvw.

As it says in the post, its not even started yet

If there is no logs in d912pxy, there should be something on your system causing troubles, otherwise send me them to see what happens

Duuuude

The issues with WvW as it always is that Arena Net do not fix the core problem which is to much damage, conditions and cc are flying around left and right. And when they do want to fix something they instead add a counter to a counter to a counter to a counter..... And in the end we will all have 50000 cc to use every second and hit with 250 k damage all whilst we have 5 k hp. Yeah i know it is exagerated but still it isn't because this is what is wrong with WvW. To much of everything. 
---
To fix it reduce damage, conditions and cc down to base and then go from there and build up until it works. And there also need to be a raise of base hp. At least for some of the classes. 
---
By doing this fights will be more engaging, last longer and more fun and tactics can be added. Groups can use different tactics instead of now were you need 500 firebrands and 500 scrapper going nonstop cleanses and then 500 scourges to drown the enemies in conditions to at least get a 1 min fight. Like what is the fun in that. It is boring and been the same for years.
---
While that's true, I think the appeal of the teleporter is getting in-game messages saying when you should head to the boss. I know I'd prefer that over having to alt-tab every 5 minutes to check how much time I have. Plus it's really not that expensive. If I ever feel the urge to get back into the game I'll probably pick it up.
---
Love it!
---
Best community in a mmorpg I've ever seen and mag is the best community for wvw mains. Come to mag it's a growing server!
---
Sweet

Maguuma is calling all wvw mains, come to mag baby you wont regret it.

I use it because I use a gamepad to play, making any mount 1 button is really nice.

T4 fractal dailies a day nets me 15-20g a day usually
---
Except for what people already written gathering nodes can give you a lot of gold every day as well. I am not saying it is the very best way but it still give you tons of gold if you gather the right nodes. Leather farming in Lake Doric can give a lot of gold. Fractals dailys give lots and lots of gold and all this together should build up a solid amount of gold and then you take it from there.
---
Wait for the fourth bonus event in the game wich will give us better rewards for PoF meta events and you will see a lot of people trying to do these meta events ;)
---
Having just unlocked this elite spec, I'm eager to see what all the fuss is about. I have to admit, I still don't even understand what I'm doing.
---
Naw, both axe and focus are great for power damage. Axe has literally the best auto chain in the game (since Daredevil staff got nerfed), so if everything else is on cooldown you can spam 1 and still do nice damage. Just make sure you hit that third-in-chain attack, it does over 3 times more damage than the preceeding hits.
---
1. Probably best meta to get xp in a short amout of time, I don't know how much DS meta gives xp but it takes longer. Anyways DS meta gives a formidable amount of xp too. 
---
2. PoF metas are kinda lackluster and not many people do them (Amnoon one is an expection but idk about its xp), however repeating the hero points daiy give a nice amount of xp compared to how little xp PoF masteries need.
---
3. Silverwastes is one, at least RIBA maps or if there's some more new, mor eefficient eay to do SW. Don't know about the situation of Istan, but you should check into it. Also doing 1x VB night boss(matriarch) -&gt; TD -&gt; AB gives some gold through basic mats, ectos from rares and amalgamated gemstones.
---
4. You should check a guide for SW's RIBA, tl;dr of RIBA is to go thru forts in order while digging chests and tagging events, doing Vinewrath and bandit chest farm during the meta cooldown. Open the bags on lvl ~51 character.
---
Don't know about Istan atm.
---
Just do the mentioned HoT metas and sell what you get; don't forget to choose amalgamated gemstones from rewards (daily per meta).
---
He's most likely refering to Fractals like we used to have the good old fractal 40 farm (molten twins) until they nerfed it (changed the entire fractal so it took much longer to complete)
---
Frac 61 is Aquatic Ruins
---
Oh? How is playing on the gamepad like? I've wanted to try that for a while. What app are you using?
---
I don't know why people still play WvW... Every time i play it, I get a little blue...
---
If you can find a static raid group, for me it averages around a 80g a week for ~4-5h's of raiding.
---
Better yet: since it's from the first grand chest you open **daily** and the event will remove the daily rewards, who's to say you can't get a Hero's Choice from every grand chest?
---
My logic is:
---
(currently)Open grand chest -&gt; has HC been awarded today? if no, have a HC. If yes, no more HC.
---
(theoretical event mechanics) Open grand chest -&gt; HC is never flagged as awarded -&gt; always drop HC
---
But hopping to another map would be the old multi-loot, which was patched out.

---
you have like 7 evades, what are you complaining about?
---
no, i don't think so.
---
lets call it subjective preferences, even tho you could categorize as opinion for any reason, have no meaningful value, which imo was the main downvote factor.
---
discussions like: whats your favorite dye color, would not have much success in the sub.
---
considering i dropped chak infu, im good to go :D
---
I got the [Etherbound Package](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Etherbound_Package) in my black lion chest this week. The glider part lets you dye it, but I can't seem to dye the backpack part (so it looks very different open and gliding to when it's closed). Am I missing something, or is that just something to live with?
---
Thats cus the vendor locations change every day at 10:00 UTC+2, the vendors' offered recipes change every day at 02:00 UTC+2 . So thats why directed to gw2timer.

Looks like Underworld

Yeah exactly this. You just speedfarm aquatic ruins on 61. Maybe we are playing with fire and Anet ends up changing aquatic ruins too, hopefully not.

Play ranked PvP during the season. By the time you progress through the league chests, you're getting 1.5 gold every segment you complete and then 20 gold when you finish the chest. If you win, it goes faster, if you lose you still make progress (and lose ranking which means you will eventually settle into a ranking where you can win more consistently).

5 seconds of googling and you find this:

There is also one at crytal oasis and one in desert highlands. Casino Blitz and a treasure hunt event.
---
why would you compare to sth outdated? you should actually compare new build with new standard to the previous build with previous standard.
---
Is buying exotic armor and weapons with Badges of Honor a good idea if I don't need the badges for anything? Or are there cheaper ways to get a full Berserker's set gold-wise?

Fractal dailies take me 30 minutes tops. Always run with 3 PDS and a quickness/Ala resource and you're good.

Delete your post please, easy money is a problem. I made over 1500g only in my way to Ascension.

If you plan on using RIBA as a gold farm more than occasionally , buy a character slot for a bag opening character.

id like challenge your mother in pvp so we can help prove your point
---
&gt; Making the assumption of a soulbeast, renegade and core warrior in your sub squad makes the implication that you're being built around in a comp
---
and how is it different from implicating you're being built around a comp when you take war+druid buffs? because that was the meta before, and now meta is different, so the buffs change. 
---
i dont understand why should i be doing benchmark with buffs that are not valid anymore. we have new game client with new optimal comp. if i showed you benchmark but used outdated standard, then the result would be inaccurate to current game build standards. and benchmark is supposed to showcase the class dps in regard to current version of the game, not old. the argument that you can't compare it to different classes now is not an issue of me not using outdated buffs, but it's issue of other new benchmark videos using new standard not being out yet. you should just wait till other ppl create benchmarks in accordance to new buff set.
---
&gt; My current gold farm? Gem Store &gt; $10USD for 800 gems &gt; exchange at current gold rate.
---
This is the only one time saving/most profitable method there is.
---
As for any other method, do not do anything that you would not enjoy. Everything you do will give you coin. Make sure to mix as much as needed to still be fun. Any minute spent on farming for sake of farming, it not profitable, which one has fewer losses? Daily istan/riba, daily t4, weekly raid, meta chains, pvp, flipping, mob grinding, etc...
---
Well, for those not having a static things shape a bit differently. 
---
*joins group of 2* "We need Chrono/Heal" *wait 2-30mins for those 2 roles to show up*
---
Said it before and I say it again. PvP can get you around 100 gold a Season if you only play casually a few matches per play session. Once you've blocked all the annoying players who constantly blame your or the opponents team, it becomes a really fun experience. 
---
And while you're at it you can get a ton of achievement points while slowly working towards a legendary backpack.
---
&gt; silverwastes.loltools.net
---
Which says 49-53 anyway
---
They're trying to drive participation in specific events and event chains. World Boss Week is focused on Central Tyria (i. e. core game) world bosses, like Fire Elemental in Metrica Province, Shadow Behemoth in Queensdale, etc. Wiki can probably tell you which events those will be and where to find them. They're adding a bonus drop to each successful event completion to encourage participation. This is probably going to be a good time to work on achievements for Tequatl and Shatterer, too.
---
The Meta-Event Rush is focused on map-wide 'meta event' chains by removing a limit on how many times a day you can receive a big loot chest. There are some of these in core Tyria, IIRC, but they're more common in the Living Story and expansions. Verdant Brink's nighttime events, Auric Basin's Octovine, and the Serpent's Ire event chain in Domain of Vabbi. (This may favor running Auric Basin's meta, unless they keep a cap in place on the chests, there.)
---
World bosses and meta events should all be on the [timer page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers), so you can get links to find out what/where they are and see when they're about to start.
---
The proposed iterations either encourage participation additional loot, some variety of collective reward for overall participation, or new achievements. Exactly what those will entail depends on what they do, though it sounds like world boss events and map metas are where they're trying to drive interest.
---
I use the Steam Controller. It's actually pretty sweet once I got it all configured (the Steam Controller has a TON of customization). I stream it (using Steam Link) to a device in the living room. 
---
For me, the trick was creating a toggle to change what buttons do, so I can hold the left bumper to make my buttons non-combat related, or allow for more combat buttons.
---
It also has 2 triggers underneath that can be used, so I use them Dodge or Jump. I have a build on steam I can share. PM me if you're interest, don't want my steam tag all over the reddit. ;)
---
I dont have a static group either, never have an issue getting a full group that's either meta or close to it
---
That's what I think.
---
Your question about RIBA shows you are doing it all wrong. RIBA doesn't just pay out liquid gold. Almost nothing does. RIBA makes money by tagging as many events as possible and then digging and opening as many chests as possible ( I have recently seen a squad or two that completely foregoes digging up chests afterward , and they're morons ) , Then you salvage ( preferably on a "bag opener" character ) basically everything and sell the crafting materials. Mats are are one of the most commonly sold ways to get gold in the game. If you are stowing them , even RIBA won't make you money.
---
If you want plain liquid gold without no thinking, no salvaging, no real research. Do Teq once a day , do your 3 dailies , do T4 fractals. you'll make about 25 liquid gold per day without bothering to learn the markets or whatever.
---
Night capping 101
---
I was going to recommend that but OP would need full ascended for that, for which they would need gold to craft beforehand or a long grind in t2-t3.
---
It's super slow at 2g a day (If the dailies are the only thing you're doing), but since it only takes like 5 minutes it's pretty good value for time spent.  We should all be doing our dailies!
---
Most boring builds are the meta ones, as they are very efficient. And efficient usually means using the least possible skills in the least possible time that will have the greatest effect possible.  
---
Efficient play is just not fun, unless by fun you mean getting the rewards sooner.
---
What fun can be getting to the destination early if you didn't have time to enjoy the journey?  
---
That's why I always do the first playthrough in story with low damage gear. So fights last enough to see what their attacks and behaviors are and play with them like a cat with a toy mouse. I can thrash enemies in little time later for rewards and achievements.
---
Weird, I have the vastly opposite. Sure DPS Show Up frequently and chronos are decent, too, But heals can Take forever on slow or very busy times.
---
Any Tips for finding Something quicker?
---
I see , thanks!
---
Even with a perfect group, which I doubt you're consistently getting with pugs, there are fractals like Siren's, Observatory, and Deepstone which have multiple wait points built into them.
---
Some days you can easily do t4s and recs in 30 minutes, but with the randomness of fractals and the randomness of pugs, I see those as the good days and not the normal days.
---
Wrong game, exile.

sorry to disappoint, the glory days of wvw are long gone.

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well\_of\_Action](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Well_of_Action)
---
Gear up a healer or ala/quick hero.
---
I have the following so I can always swap to whatever I need and they all get the job done.
---
DH/FB for quickness
---
Soulbeast/Druid for heals
---
Power Elementalist
---
Power zerker for might
---
Condi Scourge (from a few metas back)
---
Well it's not like equipping a reflect is such a bad idea in general (for WvW).
---
Well if he spends 20 bucks he can gear himself up and not have to spend 20 bucks again so he can do FOTM I guess.
---
Invest in the gear I suppose
---
Ranger and Rev are super boring imo. Mirage and Rifle Deadeye are most fun to me. Rifle deadeye especially in events on PoF maps cuz it can actually be pretty difficult to maximize dps while trying not to die.
---
Is this hod?
---
Hmm,looking Into the pack in further detail, the only rng stuff are the dye packs week 1, the mount adoption (which includes a new set), and the 5 keys in later weeks. The value of the non-rng mount skin, the backpack kit, outfit voucher, and the 2 weapon skins make this a good cosmetic pack for 2400. I get you want to go the whole anti consumer route,but this ain't it pal
---
Just curious but what exactly does raids give that net you that much gold?
---
Make your own groups.
---
Am I the only person who finds legendary stuff completely overwhelming? Every time I look at it I'm disheartened. lol
---
metabattle&gt;open world builds or simply use fractal/raid one.
---
At work so I can't provide precise builds, but short bow for thief is fantastic for tagging. Mirage great sword is all pretty good for tagging. Both can be played at range and you can modify gear/utilities for more defense if needed.
---
You can do your dailies quick for 2 gold. 
---
You can farm elder wood at that one spot in Malchor's Leap.  I have 10 characters parked there and I do it once an hour.  4 gold every 2 hours.  
---
You can do meta events and sell the unidentified gear bags.  I open the rares and sell the other ones.  
---
You can craft the 'once per day' items and sell them (like Deldrimor Steel Ingots). 
---
Run daily Fractals.  
---
If you can find a good group do 8 different dungeon paths for 5 gold.  This is pretty time consuming but if you need dungeon armor or weapons it works out.  
---
These are just things I can think of that are consistent.  I'm sure there's much easier ways of doing it like flipping items on the TP but I've never been a fan of that since it doesn't feel like I'm playing a game at that point anymore.
---
1) Go to SpvP
---
2) Be low ranked
---
3) Dodge and press 1. Heal and press 1.  Dodge while stunned and then press 1. Illusionary ambush and press 1.
---
4) Enemy thinks you are clone and ignores you
---
5) If you somehow get CCd, dodge inside CC
---
6) somehow win
---
Yeah i am so excited the for world boss event.
---
No it wasn't in maintenance mode, whether we were getting things faster or not. Maintenance mode means you're not getting new story, new zones, new PvP maps, new fractals, or anything else. At different times content delivery does come faster and slower, that's true. I mean when we had a 9 month content draught after HoT launched, the game wasn't in maintenance mode. 
---
It was just being badly managed, which meant stuff didn't come out. I don't know about you but I got a zone and story four months or so ago. Hardly maintenance mode. 
---
Guild Wars 1 is in maintenance mode.
---
ALL HAIL TO THE UNDERWORLD
---
not really, theres handful of *viable* core builds but majority of meta builds are from expansions and are just plain better and often easier.
---
dude, NEVER convert gems to gold.
---
i just hoard mats and sell 'em, \~100+ of each at a time, but i'm patient. if you're not so patient, daily fractals and silverwastes are still decent sources.
---
Thats an interesting point of view. Thoughtful
---
How much longer will they sell the same items? I might have to run home for lunch (1.5 hours from now) and if I do, I may log on just to get this.
---
Image yourself being a big company (like NCSoft) and you just had to quit projects because they weren't going to be profitable or they weren't going as planned. Imagine what you would do with the resources you have left which actually got you the money to start other projects in the first place (GW2). 
---
I rest my case.
---
never thought of it, but you're 100% right
---
I second this and i would also say that it is totally fine to tag with shortbow and do big dps on bosses with the rifle
---
First, game development is not as fast as players consume it. One should keep in mind that most released are at generally 3-6 months old in terms of core development... And maybe more in terms of early design. Basically IF you feel we get more updates now, bear in mind that those things were developed before the lay-off.
---
That said, I really don't think that we got more updates since February... Maybe they pushed the last balance a bit earlier in order to fill the gap with the delayed episode 6. But the current events were planned before. Maybe without the lay-off they would have been released earlier or canceled but it's definitely not something they developed within 6 weeks.
---
this kind of events are nothing unique. a lot of MMOs have them.  Anet just have to develop them once and then they repeat every couple months. it't like Halloween/Wintersday
---
we will see if we get more and regulat content in the next year with LW Season 5
---
Maintenance mode implies no major updates, so objectively no.
---
Maybe there will be more effort put into things for a bit--we will see the release after next. Episode 6 even with the delays was likely too far along to be affected much one way or the other.
---
Any reason you censor half the screen?
---
yep gw2 isnt esport anymore and pvp community shrunk a lot since those days. both player count and average player skill is lower
---
But what about renegade? :3
---
Yep, this is what my WvW map usually looks like.
---
I don't *really* want my warclaw or anything. Honest.
---
They made it so you can jump maps and open as many of the small chests as you want, but they’re not cost effective. The two higher tiers you can only open once per day.
---
Time to strip off the invulnerable buff from enemies when they are in their spawns, so you can now claim their spawn and all EBG to yourselves.
---
Nah weaver bunker isn't about strong heals.. It's about constant dodges and constant little heals and barriers.
---
So if you get me down to 30% with 3 hits I get in trouble. That's why I hate bursts...
---
I used to run SI for [EVA] but my computer decided that every part of it was suddenly going to crap out on me. It's fixed now so I'm gonna start the EVA PoF/LS4 meta train again in a couple weeks -- possibly when the bonus event is up, or the week before. I'll post a topic on Reddit a bit closer to the date, I've been looking to slot Istan and Augury Rock in somewhere now I'm not stepping on any multi-mapper's toes in Palawadan. Full schedule and start time will be then, but generally we run it starting at server time (high) noon in Amnoon on Sundays.
---
In addition to forming your own groups (you can set your own requirements there), don't be afraid to try your luck with groups that have requirements you don't quite meet. You'll be insta-kicked *a lot*, don't get me wrong, but a lot of commanders will be willing to give you a shot. I don't personally suggest faking LI pings (it's just kinda a dick thing to do as well as being far more likely to get you blacklisted by someone), but if you're honest about your situation you should be able to find some people who will give you, at minimum, an "okay we'll take you but if you wipe the group once you're out".
---
You're being very *delusional*.
---
oh I bet all those TP barons will buy all chaks :D
---
Get a job and spend a % of your salary on gems which you can then convert to gold
---
I began playing GW2 in January, only for WvW, haven't stopped since. Now I'm a commander in Baruch Bay, and I love this game mode. I barely play anything else when playing GW2.
---
Why not just crop the mystic forge wondow?
---
I feel like there is a lot of diversity even within each class now that elite specs have been added.  Medi-hammer core guard has a completely different cadence than Support Firebrand, and both are unlike DPS Dragonhunter.
---
What content are you mainly playing?  If it's solo open-world content and all your builds are Zerk, then yeah it will start to feel monotonous.  I recommend changing it up; a fun build might not be optimal, but will keep the game fresh.
---
They say *the pen is mightier than the sword.* I guess that's the same for axes too.
---
i'm not talking about whatever bunker weaver is about. if you want to bunker without hating burst builds, maybe try a different class. if you want to hate burst builds, have fun with weaver.
---
2. Probably Desert Highlands. You can chain Treasure Hunters, Water Diviners, and Ogre Pet stuff very easily. They are short and frequent. Also the cave with tiny Oozes by High Jump Ranch gives tones of XP.
---

I did not think about it XD
---
It's not terrible, but if you know the right way to search on the trading post (hint: filter for level 80 exotics with Power, Precision, and Ferocity rather than typing in the word "Berserker") you can find equivalent gear that might be even cheaper, come already with runes and sigils attached, and/or have interesting skins on them. Compare the prices there to the ones at WvW gear vendors and get whichever one works best for you.
---
Believe me, no one cares about your mastery level or your 3 salvage kits in your inventory.
---
That's how I feel most festivities. I know you can make ton of gold from them but I just dont find them fun anymore.
---
Less than an hour, sure.
---
Less than half an hour is a bit more difficult.
---
Ele is generally considered one of the most difficult classes to play well, if not the most difficult.  What weap are you currently using on your weaver?  Melee weaver is more difficult than ranged IMO, if you want that challenge.  If you're experiencing issues with your hand, and you don't already, have you considered using a gaming mouse with 12 side keys?  Definitely saved my hands when I got one!
---
However, it sounds like you're getting bored with the combat/build complexity in the game as a whole.  This game doesn't really require a million keybinds like some other games, doesn't have a large number of great builds for each class, and doesn't have a lot of situational adjustments or variables to consider.  The game wasn't designed to be overly complex or variable.
---
didn't even hide your exp bar, your account is basically mine at this point
---
Don’t forget about the mountains of trans charges you get.
---
Guild Wars is in maintenance mode, not Guild Wars 2. There is no new content in Guild Wars being worked on.
---
Yep! Time is the most valuable resource on the planet, not money.
---
/r/woooosh
---
You should add if you are on the EU or NA servers.
---
If you can find a commander running champ trains in Crystal Oasis. It's ridiculously rare and I only really know of one person who actually knows the events there well enough to actually run it... BUT if you manage to scale the events up (need 20ish but can be finicky) and farm events that spawn Champion Forged Officers, you have a high chance of dropping Exotic Harrier recipes (these are in the champ bags that they drop) that can be sold on the TP for 10-20g each. (Sure, market would crash if CO became the mainstream farm, but abuse it while you can)
---
Sandswept is still pretty good if you can scale the Specimen chamber up (the goal is just tagging mobs, bosses are optional but you can do them anyways). Get the karmic retribution and rag as many mobs as you can. You'll get &gt;100 retributions per specimen chamber if scaled up. 
---
Kourna used to be better (before unID nerf, and when you could chain parked alts through the chests) but the meta there pops every ~20min, is very short and farmable. In both sandswept and kourna you can stock up volatile magic and buy trophy shipments for the extra gold if you need it.
---
Run the meta cycle if you can. Leyline Anomaly gives 1 mystic coin a day, Teq gives 2 gold. VB/AB/TD give 1 amalgamated gemstone each (1.7 gold, dragons stand does as well but not really worth since meta takes like 1.5-2hrs lol)
---
I have no problems in hating burst.
---
I play weaver coz I like weaver. And I like bunker... So yeah... Till weaver bunker works, I will play it.
---
This is what it feels like in T1 against Blackgate sometimes lol
---
Find and join a guild that welcomes newcomers.
---
Personally i think GoT story is shit since like season 4 or something, its juts enjoyable to watch because of the shitload of money that  has been put into it
---
well your choice but upgrading to t6 gives like 15-30 silver while upgrading common crafting materials can give 80-120 silver
---
Well, I think they plan on making these events regularly, so they will have additional chances to obtain these rewards, just a couple of months later.
---
I haven't really had a need to explore other mmo options, as I find GW2 to be just the right complexity level for me as a casual player who wants to achieve a moderate level of success, and just have fun.  But I'm sure there are many games out there that will meet your needs!
---
"Omelette du fromage"
---
I use the function keys for them. My hands are a bit small to comfortably use those keys for default binding which is the profession skills (especially on Ele) but it doesn't matter if I'm a bit slower with mounts.
---
Ahh, yesss, UW and FS reigning supreme!
---

Grenth has blessed us this day.
---
Ignore build guides and just take anything with movement based skills like teleports or gap-closers for quick ooc or keeping up with group, quick multi-enemy tagging options for loot, and revive utility to rez without actually stopping to rez. Healers aren't so great and neither are buff builds since most people just half-ass their way through the meta. But consistently rezzing downed players does wonders for your instance. Dead DPS is zero DPS and dead people who can take more than 10 seconds to rez per person make it difficult to rez downed people who can easily be brought back up almost immediately. The more people you have alive, the more people you have doing mechanics and pushing damage out. It also saves people on waypoint costs.
---
A good start would be tekkit's engie farm build. Probably the best all-rounder for metas and large scale events.
---
All classes as Norn.
---
I like being an Amazon. I just wish other games would let me be an Amazon like this game does.
---
The only class I can't get myself to spend any more time on than it took to level is Engineer. When I first started playing the game, it was the most fun class for me, but I guess I got bored. So my Engineer just sits there.
---
Right now, I've been playing with my Rev. I hop back and forth between classes on a whim.
---
I did, thanks for the chuckle
---
The unbound magic acquisition method has a slight kink to it that the article forgot to mention, where you buy the magic warped bundles from depends on what the average value of the items you get from them is. The break point is at 1.4 gold (5 packets for 5 gold and 2500 UM, gives 7 gold in return) (2 bundles for 0.8 gold and 2500 UM, gives 2.8 gold in return), for a profit of two gold per 2500 UM in both cases. If below that then buy the 40 silver version (at 1.3 gold per packet you get 1.8 gold per 2500 UM for the 40 silver version, compared to 1.5 for the 1 gold version), while if above then buy the 1 gold version (at 1.5 gold per packets you get 2.2 gold per 2500 UM for the 40 silver version, compared to 2.5 for the 1 gold version).
---
Skins needed: Raven Mantle (Shoulders), Rawhide Vest (Chest), Medium Corsair Leggings (Legs) and Belinda's Greatsword :). Also total makeoverkit needed for the hair
---
Hmm. If the rewards were the same each time or that specific rotating event , people wouldn't feel like they were missing out. But it would also lessen the reason to participate each time for people that play a lot. It's a hard balance.

T4 fractals take about 30 min.
---
Same with CMs.
---
Add +15 min if your team is bad.
---
You get *way* more than 20g/hr, heck, 42 farm is double or more that.

Buffs that rewarded skillful play. 
---
Boosted attack speed and defense as long as you stayed in combat and landed crits. 
---
Heals and defense buffs  when applied at the right time would heal you like Engineers AED.
---
Basically skills that did nothing of you stayed out of combat and played defensively but rewarded you greatly when you were in combat and invested in the right skills and traits.
---
Did you even read what was said?
---
&gt; The remaining 67 accounts also received suspensions for a period of six months because they were directly associated to one of the 1516 accounts and also had one or more previous suspensions related to botting or hacking; those suspensions will be reversed.
---
They were banned because people who were hacking or botted on alts logged into their mains (that they've hacked or botted on and been banned in the past) on the same device.
---
Tfw I'm pulling shit out of my ass because I'm using verifiable data but you're angry and assume that the numbers are surely much worse.

not even all T3.
---
meh.
---
Gathering pays very well if you know what the hell you are doing. It's entirely possible to make 10 gold/hour.
---
"improvements" as in we gonna nerf the event so much u can leave ur toon to auto attack and go afk, just like we did with chak gerent
---
You edited your pix to hide your identity, but I already know where you live.
---
(　-_･)σ
---
That "no participation" shit isn't active in SW. It was added later.
---
Exactly my point. I want other ways of making money instead of doing fractals for 3 years straight. In other mmo’s you can make fortunes by putting time in (gathering, slaying, etc...). In gw2 time does not equal money and it fucking should.
---
... And Jennah's shoes!
---
"and lose ranking which means you will settle into a ranking where you can win more consistently"
---
Not really. With the amount of players and the matchmaking system , it's very common for players with different ratings to be playing against each other anyway.
---
They're mostly true. You'll find the game is quite well populated. Action is however much more rare and infrequent. 
---
As this is the pve subreddit where some people roleplay as if everything is always amazing, many truthful posts  about the state of the game won't get to see the light of day.
---
Ghost peppers and truffles in Orr.
---
Coral and mussels in sandswept. 
---

---
No, it can be a different reward with every rotation.
---
First time you finish the meta achievement for a week-long event, you get a title and/or a weapon for example.
---
Once you finished the meta achi and the event comes back another time, you talk to a npc which unlocks another meta achi, which has basically the same requirements (maybe kill 50 bosses within boss week) but gives out different rewards, for example a new title that is a little better than the first one and an item which enables you to throw that weapon from last event rewards into the mystic forge and get a new type of weapon with new skin out of it.
---
That way, those rewards are still obtainable for every player, they just have to wait one rotation longer than players who didnt miss the first event.

And then you can get lucky drops like a Ghostly Infusion and of course convert currency to gold as well.
---
still good enough to entertain you in your neckbeard bunker
---
&gt; tekkit's engie farm build
---
Thanks for the tip! This is why I was having trouble with sites like metabattle which seemed more focused on damage output rather than what worked best in large group settings.
---
Not a good day for reds and greens. Ouchie.
---
**THE PAIN IS HERE**
---
Not much yet about the actual episode, but I love the new Greatsword.
---
That looks like a fantastic Mesmer greatsword.
---
I see a fucking butt cape. -_-
---
Maybe do some paths in Citadel of Flame or Crucible of Eternity for Dungeon tokens...
---
The music though. Wow!
---
Meh. Still cancer.
---
May 28 confirmed then?

No other is on frequently traveled route.

Well, tier 1 fractals don't. 
---
In life you typically get rewarded by the amount of effort put into things (or at least that's the moral law that's understood by most.)
---
t4 Fractals took a long time to master, including the gold to get the gear and infusions to be able to do them. The reward for doing that should be much higher than mindlessly walking around to gather plants.
---
Does the sylvari have a new "hair"style, or is it an old one?
---
Good article! One thing I personally suggest is investing in the unbound magic gathering tools you can purchase from heart vendors in LWS4 maps, it gives you a bonus supply of VM over time when you're doing other things.
---
No actual day. Really? Are you serious?
---
I don't recall the guide having any "wrong" information. It's less than complete and may not be optimal, but nothing in it is false.

Hi I'm super new and bought the expansions and used a 80 quick level up on my necro. I want to go back and do all of the storyline in a nice easy pace but I want to unlock the specializations just because as i play I want to get used to the skills better. 
---
Do I just do activities in each expansion zone to get the specialization unlocked or do I do something else. 
---
Also can anyone guide me to a basic rotation video for necro?? I should have just leveled slowly but now I'm stuck. Any help is appreciated!
---
No its coming next month no release date yet.
---
Well thats **iiiintteresttiiinngg**g....
---
I love anything blue/purple though so I'm biased. It looks fine though, refreshing to see something different for once for a legendary greatsword. Tired of looking at the existing 3.
---
Already trying to decide how best to fashion wars that armor. Looks great.
---
Also, might personally be skipping the legendary GS. It looks good, but I'd need to see more effects for how it interacts with skills.
---
Now that i found this post i know you aren't at your right mind. Lol, 3 times illusion... Dude... idk what to say.
---
Read the actual description more details in the coming days. At least we have month.
---
It looks very mesemer centric, not my thing but cool I guess.
---
Is joke
---
HOLY SHIT THAT GREATSWORD LOOKS AMAZING!
---
Mist Shard Armor...I guess this is going to be a non traditional map
---
Exordium....obliterate!
---
Time is an illusion.
---
well,im glad i have eternity,bcs this gs is trash.
---
Wish they’d told us about the new map but this is still super exciting!
---
That feeling when you save &amp; gather all the mats and funds for the new legendary greatsword and finally get your first glimpse of it ..... and it's just nah, not for me. 
---
Also, no mention of a new legendary ring, trinket or amulet? Unless that features in the 'more info in the coming days'.
---
Plus side, May is shaping up to be a busy month in-game. Content!
---
I'm happy to help you out! I'm on Yaks Bend :) Send an email to Arae X in game or dm me your in-game account name or character name to add you \^\^
---
May 28th is still May. So I wouldn’t rule it out.
---
Yeah, I feel the same way. The effects seem to be some sort of reality-shattering (looks like glass) illusion that really screams Mesmer. I won't be making this one but I think it will be popular.
---
Kingdom Heart Greatsword much!!!
---
I really enjoy using Scourge and Deadeye depending on the boss. Scourge has great AOE tagging potential and playing Deadeye with pistol/pistol and invigorating precision is a blast against bounties or legendary bosses. Sometimes I'll take Elementalist too w/ a staff because even if it has slower tagging potential than scourge it's got excellent range and some nice utility
---
I'm not saying don't rule it out I'm just stating a fact that its next month and I actually think it will be early May after the first week long bonus event. So my prediction is 14th May.
---
The Forbidden One...
---
You have scrappers and tome 2 for group cleansing. The best damage dealers are revs and scourges, so using something gimmicky that relies on no condi clearing from your opponent will put you far behind any competent group.
---
I still can't fathom how you're arguing in favor of this.
---
Ring comes with the new raid which is not coming this release.
---
Mist Shard Armor...I guess we’re going to Kralk
---
Old. It's actually [this male sylvari style](https://i.imgur.com/tAEKAtt.png).
---
Reminds me too much of The Shining Blade atm. Need to see it ingame.
---
As a mirage main that is forced to use a greatsword for any open world content (ANet, make Staff not suck for tagging please) I am PSYCHED. This looks awesome. Screw the story, getting legendary first.
---
The Shining Blade in greatsword form?
---
Old one. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Exclusivehair-sylvarimale10.jpg
---
very mesmery
---
The waypoint in the background is yellow... interesting
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

---
If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
Even tho, this was the first raid video from tekkit that i have watched, and never relied on videos for raid purposes, keeping crucial mistakes like this in your (u/sankurix) videos will only result in loss of trust from people seeking raid tutorials and returning viewers. 
---
While it is really hard to edit what was already posted a good solution would be mentioning the errors in description and pinning a comment with notes, if for example, Luthi posted those under your videos.
---
Buying the shiiiiiiit out of that fennec foxxy looking jackal.
---
Good point, but hopefully there will be an amulet or trinket building off the episode content as well, like Aurora
---
the music is just the unfinished 'Kralkatorrik vs Aurene' from All or Nothing, that's how this track would sound like if there wasn't the live choir singing in it.
---
The fact the trailer is so simple makes me think there's some heavy stuff they don't want to spoil at all, it's pretty exciting
---
Wow that thing is AMAZING
---
Sorry Eternity you're officially retired
---
Also of note: "exordium" is an English word associated with the introduction of various formal writings.
---
&gt; ex·or·di·um  
---
&gt; *noun* [Formal]
---
&gt; the beginning or introductory part, especially of a discourse or treatise.
---
It is hard to top Twilight and Sunrise.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 combat is hyperagressive. Nobody has enough defenses and self-healing to be completely self-sustaining.
---
Sure doesn't feel like that when fighting celestial eles in wvw.
---
I will mainly be playing PVE stuff, world events, Fractals, and dungeons. (so not PvP or Raids)
---
Looking for a class that utilizes Shouts that is somewhat meta for group events. I just like the aspect of shouts and want to use one! Thanks in advance!
---
I'm not a huge fan of the new armor, but I think pieces of it will work pretty well with other stuff
---
It will match my Choya perfectly. o\_o
---
Can you point me in the direction of farming for 8-ish gold a day? As a long time player I've never really done this so I'm intrigued.
---
Ah, great to know! I only just started PoF this weekend. Now I have something to look forward to. :)
---
I must say I like how they keep adding new armor sets. A lot of us complain about outfits (I hate them), so getting new armor sets is very welcome.
---
May 28 seem a bit too far away considering they teased the episode for some time now.
---
I don't think this sub is capable of understanding sarcasm.
---
feels like this trailer was missing something.
---
yuuup, we're going to the mists !!
---
Oh you're being serious. Lmao.
---
No, but ANet was shifting resources towards unannounced mobile projects (which have since been scrapped, or at least mothballed), meaning GW2 was starting to regularly miss release targets for no clear reason and with the occasional odd drop in quality. The layoffs, while unfortunate for everyone involved, should mean that GW2 will have more people focusing on it overall, ideally leading to more consistent and higher-quality releases.
---
Did not like it at first, but seeing it in motion has changed my opinion on it. Looking forward to checking it out ingame. I might have to retire my Caladbolg Orchida :(.
---
nothing is faster than your credit card. just play the game doing what you enjoy, don't waste gold and let it accumulate naturally
---
What kind of role are you hoping to play? Do you enjoy warrior? 
---
I can definitely give you some starting advice about specializing with condi (sword) or power damage (axe)... hybrid builds typically don't work on Warrior and are very rare to work well at all currently.
---
calm dawn, its 2h of content every 5 months..
---
Best way is to be sure to buy the LS4 map-specific items from the heart vendors anytime you complete a heart.  So, for example, in Thunderhead you get 5 branded mass for 2275 karma.  Eat them for 100 volatile magic (worth about 60c/ea) and turn into trophy crates and you get roughly 22-26 silver per 1000 karma.  
---
The gw2efficiency page is nice, but not the whole picture.  Crates are gated by trade contracts, beaded weapons are slow to sell, and seriously screw all of the forging with the gloves.

I beg to differ, it's very easy to top Twilight.
---
GS is ugly ASF its not look like legendary at all and ANOTHER spiked armor with crystals ..... hmmmmmmmmm....
---
gona be released SOON.... XD
---
Ha! The new armor set took me by surprise.
---
Skimmers maybe? over like quick sand? not sure on wp
---
Definitely look like skimmers to me
---
It looks good but I think I like eternity more. This one is way to0 mesmer.
---
What. Srsly? Was it confirmed that it was a mobile project? Possibly GW2 mobile?
---
I am most excited about the new mount and its possibilities of new mechanics that will introduce.
---
Contested Way Point?
---
Mixed with some immortal skin style.
---
Results don't lie man, either does arc. Even with the cleansing, fb pumps damage. I was 100% on board with no burning a couple weeks ago and I was wrong.  Check out some of figrins videos, you can see him topping the dps meter even against organized groups:  https://youtu.be/NbTDS9z_C1Y
---
Sigil of Nullification...
---
And it is still cool to play threw it, each time. And farm the new Map for cool Loot.
---
Yeah, I agree with your post, that's already what I had in mind in my original post but you explained it well.
---
It's just hard to make a Defensive Stealth traitline work for the game, and Arenanet is probably aware of that, but reworking the traitline could prove unhealthy for the game if they make it too powerful as well. 
---
Thief is in a weird spot Trait wise already anyway, with Trickery being so prevalent, Crit strikes being such a boring "gain damage line", and shadow arts being abandoned. :|  
---
It needs the same kind of rework Mesmer got a while ago.
---
Imagine if we could fuse Exodium with Eternity for the ultimate GS
---
That GS does look really bad. :(
---
Looks like I might have a new GS skin for my Mesmer!
---
Well this is the finale and when we fight Kralky so its likely some sort of mechanic where waypoints are contested due to a meta event.
---
is this the last legendary for now or I'm missing one?
---
welcome to final fantasy x
---
tbh its my first rpg game with which i sticked for longer than one day :p Im mostly League of Legends player in which i used to play bruisers/tanks(love both) I like warrior do far but playing hammer/mace feels pretty bad...im not fanof beeing immobile meatball i would like to play either as tank cc maybe with one dash or kinda tanky decent dps
---
F2P player here . Just completed personal story and hit lvl 80 on necro and want to get into WvW . Which build and gear should i run ? . Also please advice on how to get necessary gear ?
---
&gt; This one is way to0 mesmer.
---
As a diehard Chronomancer this thing has me wondering if I can justify going S+S/GS instead of S+S/+Focus. :P
---
The skybox is now the limit!
---
I'm only on mainly during evenings for reset, but they get a few overflow groups. It's WAY more popular than PoF maps.
---
pretty sure woodenpotatoes will tell us in a bit
---
Its so stupid that they downvote you. I dont have a static and it usually takes 30min or less to complete T4. Obviously you have to add the time to find a group but that usually doesnt take longer than 10min and with a static you would have to settle for a fixed time wich is more of a hassle imo.
---
very Immortal weapon set-y
---
Fingers crossed :P
---
I have a funny feeling that the armor untied to fractals and shards. I do recall Ben wanting to pitch an idea about golden fractal relics. What if it's a must forged set similar to the pvp and wvw sets. It would be a major incentive to to have  a unique skin for the ascended boxes from here
---
it is
---
What a combo with shining blade too
---
New armor set...get your bets in now on what one particular material they’ll pick that will dry up in resources and spike in gold price lol.
---
unfortunately that would immediately ruin it for half of the player base
---
No more carrots please, the first two collections were already annoying. Give me something to feed to my majestic sea flapflap instead, like a Quaggan or two.
---
That iridescent greatsword looks like it belongs to the black lion Immortal weapon set.
---
&gt; plenty of repeatable content
---
is there? 
---
legit question (not trying to be negative): what are you refering to?
---
Shot in the dark but hat if it's a fractal armor set instead
---
Huh, so the GS has a unique effect for Spatial Surge.
---
I wonder if any other skill will also see some visual changes other than trails or projectiles.
---
Not gonna be surprised if it will come with first episode of season 5.
---
Team 1's episode is always shipped with raid (except with the very first one, LS3E1):
---
* LS3E4 - Bastion of the Penitent
---
* LS4E1 - Hall of Chains
---
* LS4E4 - Mythwright Gambit‎
---
Iirc Mythwright Gambit‎ was already done but they just needed to do voice stuff and for some reason it was long enough that they had to release it with episode made by Team 1. Coincidence? I think not.
---
I expect another raid with LS5E1 release.
---
It's not 8 a day it's 8 per hour. But it's not hard. You either know what you want to gather ( because it sells ) and where to do it , or you follow the routes that are kept updated on a website ( I don't need one , but I think people gw2efficiency has maps of rich nodes etc).
---
As an example , there is a "tree farm" spot in malchors leap zone , that has 6 elder woods trees right beside each other , in a relatively safe area , that also spawns ghost peppers. Both of those sell well. You gather with every toon you have. If you only have a few toons, then u t-port to Siren's and chop wood . IF you have a lot of toons, you skip that step cause you don't need it. You run through al your toons in ML , and by the end of them , the trees have respawned for the first character.
---
Or you can farm mussels for the chance to hit a 5 gold pearl ( glyph of bounty helps immensely here)
---
Or you can use the website and port around just hitting the most profitable rich nodes ( iron and platinum ).
---
The problem is , this is one of the most boring , mind-numbing forms of farming , while still making only about half what running Silverwastes does. The only real benefit is it can always be done solo.
---
and then were back to the HoT maps
---
Strange way to spell Sunrise ;P
---
And that's the most important thing when it comes to armor! Mixing and matching.
---
this is a top comment.
---
Well, at least they didn't let the end of the "welcome back" thing go by without saying *something*, and with any luck we'll have more concrete details before the week is out. Still, I can't help but find it a bit odd that they missed the golden opportunity of having the focus go straight from E5 to E6 on what would have been the sixth week of the event, particularly considering they started said event right in the middle of the Super Adventure Festival in order to have it end on what was expected to be a major patch day (which ended up happening last week instead). It would have made much more sense to delay the start of the event by a week or three (hopefully just a week or *two*), avoiding that overlap and making everything line up nicely. Whatever the internal reasoning, I just hope we don't have to wait until the 21^(st) for E6 - I'm willing to accept the odd delay, but nearly five months (meaning about eleven months of development time) is really pushing it, to the point where if the early parts of S5 aren't a strong return to form I'll be honestly worried about the future of GW2.
---
maybe something to do with that stuff above it perhaps?
---
I never liked Eternity, the concept doesnt go w any of my characters. This one is a Must Have tho
---
skimmers and contested way point
---
According to Snowcrows benchmarks, the GS-Domination variant was like 8% more DPS than Focus-Illusions last patch, and nothing much changed that would move their DPS relative to each other
---
Lunchtime doubly so
---
Fractals, dailies, Auric Basin, if you have a good groups, you can run 8 dungeons daily for ~10g
---
thats like NIER OST... IN MY GUILD WARS 2? 
---
EARGASM.
---
I wonder how different the skyscale will be from the griffon and if it will also be infesable to get without buying gold. Looks awesome though
---
I hope you know just how much you made my day with one comment. :D
---
Definitely try out all your weapon options. Axe+axe is pretty good
---
Some waypoints in orr glow yellow when contested, no?
---
I guess I hoping for more on the GS. It looks like a toy, sort of plastic-y, IMO. I think the animations are cool-ish, but just that it seems to standout too much from the art style, kind of like a tattoo that looks like someone slapped a sticker on their skin.
---
Next up: Harpoon gun
---
2 hour video analysis. Where when it releases he's never right about any assumption lol.
---
It actually reminds of something out of Wildstar. IDK I think I’m going to finish sunrise instead, I like the animations for the most part, the color scheme is too jarring and tacky for my tastes, at least when paired with the GW2 art style.
---
Why is the waypoint yellow.
---
WHY
---
 anet: "We’re currently adding more polish to the final encounter in the next  raid, which continues the story of Qadim and will get its own release  after Episode 6. We’re utilizing one of the new team’s efforts to build  some additional small-scale open world content so all of our players  will have something to celebrate with the release of the raid."
---
It looks like this is normal armor, without it's "upgrades" like the last one so it might be actually easier to be obtained for majority of players. Unless this is for fractals only or sth else.
---
"Meh"
---
it's more of a teaser. if it was a proper trailer they would have a release date
---
Dont let a mesmer shatter them :P
---
Agreed.
---
Maybe May 21. But im more predicting May 14
---
Maybe we will finally have a use for the Pile of Golden Sand?
---
I love, love love, love love this so much. I enjoy the more subtle Legendaries. It just ugh I can't wait to have this in my hands.
---
Wow thanks for the run down.
---
Wow people have a lot of characters. I only play 2, a level 80 slyvari guardian firebrand, and a level 80 born ranger soulbeast, and I have trouble switching between those. I cant imagine having like 30 characters how do you guys even do that??
---
It's been stated that the Skyscale won't be able to go nearly as fast as a post-dive griffon, but instead it will be able to gain height by latching onto walls and going aloft again from them.  So if you view the Griffon as a flying mount capable of incredible horizontal speed, and thus an alternative to the Raptor/Jackal, the Skyscale would be a flying mount capable of vertical gains and thus an alternative to the Springer.
---
Not new new, I see, thank you.
---
Maan, I love it..
---
You can definitely see more of the desert aesthetic in the background of the [greatsword section](https://youtu.be/hCzqrKMvqKg?t=23) of the video. Please please please let this map connect core Tyria to Path of Fire!
---
They better do. I really sick of mesmers being favoured these days in fashion wars. Too many purple sets for them lately! I want Kralkatorrik to be dealt with just because of that.
---
Not a fan of that "RGB GAMING NEON" vibe. I was hoping for a very different style considering the existing legendary GS are already very flashy and unrealistic. Ah well, I'll just sell my mats...
---
They showed all 3 types of armor scene by scene
---
thought the same thing
---
And now I can’t chose between crafting Dawn or this one on my Mesmer zzzz
---
... what if its personal waypoint created by some --gemstore-- device?
---
Seems quite loaded, new mount and new armor in the same episode. Its also the finale, so we'll get a set up for next season which will be interesting
---
With lyrics:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnhtl3Z9wOA&amp;t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnhtl3Z9wOA&amp;t=32s)
---
Seems like it is mandatory in gameplay (these islands) when you look at this teaser so it might be even easier than Roller Beetle.
---
Oh boi
---
My thoughts exactly.  Looks like something I'd get with a black lion scrap ticket.
---
Correct. Here is [Source](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
The "The Next Few Months" section, last paragraph.
---
Maybe that would spoil it too much, but we can approximate based on flora and the look of it
---
Take it a step at a time. Once you make your first one or two you'll realize there's very little difference in what is required to make one. Don't think of it as grinding out the legendary. Think of it as, "I'm almost finished with this gift. A few more gold and I'll have enough for the precursor."
---
Imagine the outlash if you could combine that one with eternity and get another "doueble-legy" (Tripple-legy?). =D
---
Maybe they're like the new movie versions of Sherlock Holmes, type of scholar.  They are a scholar on *exactly* how and where to hit their opponent to maximize damage output.
---
I was hoping for some swing effects like crystals falling when you swing it or something.  Doesn't have to be as much as Twilight/Dawn/Eternity but maybe something more like Astralaria or Shining Blade.  It just looks like a gemstore skin at this point, honestly.
---
Did they ever put release date in teasers though? I only remember in their trailers and that is it.
---
The new armor has a TERA wibe. Not bad.
---
That great sword tho
---
Actually money -&gt; gems -&gt; gold is MUCH more efficient than any in game gold source. You can earn 250g+ an hour at pretty much any job these days. You cannot come close to that in game.
---
More like World Boss Lagdown. And if you crash before the end of the fight, you get NOTHING! You LOSE!. Good day, sir.  I said GOOD DAY!
---
it's a keyblade
---
Yellow way point with three Charr mounted on skimmers, could we be seeing the Charr homelands here?
---
Looks like it goes with Shining Blade in terms of colors. And the immortal weapons maybe.  
---
It's about what I expected of the new lego greatsword... generic super-shiny. But I do like it. I was half-jokingly fearing it'd go the way of Shooshodoodoo and the BoatGun 9000 and just be a huge floppy dildo, but thankfully it's a usable skin.
---
If your goal is best performance I'd suggest taking a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8gctrf/full_guide_maximizing_your_fps_and_game/) thread, it was made some time ago but it's still very viable.
---
However if your goal is best appearance with a decent frame rate, I'd suggest min-maxing the settings yourself until you're satisfied.
---
&gt;So you're saying it only works on low rank fools? How is that broken then?
---
The "press 1 and win" works at gold and below. You have to make effort if you want to succeed. Obviously.
---
And yes, its easy to tell. If you are not avg player..and thats majority. Being avg player and all.
---
Also it was joke.
---
That would be dope!
---
The moment when i prepared almost everything for this last Gen 2 Legendary, waiting for it to be announced and released, and now realising it is just fit a certain style/ theme ( Mesmer ) and not as grand as Eternity which suit for everyone.... Maybe i expect too much, but.. it's just sad :(
---
&gt; Then you salvage ( preferably on a "bag opener" character ) basically everything and sell the crafting materials.
---
SW gives Unidentified Gear now, right?  Is it more worthwhile to sell the UID directly, salvage them, or open them and salvage the items that way?
---
PRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
But that's not their defence regarding dungeons?
---
Ancient Kyrtans called it Thyria
---
i 100% agree. i still would NEVER suggest that anyone ever convert RLC -&gt; gold
---
is it just me or is the World Boss portal Device not on sale for me ?
---
ok?
---
POG
---
Yeah, i prepared everything as well, it's just sad, its like anticipating a newborn, bought everything for him or her... And....meh
---
This doesn't even make sense but whatever floats your boat.
---
&gt;cancer
---
i don't think that means what you think it means
---
https://imgur.com/C5xDUJm
---
not exactly like in the video but close
---
What a disappointment.....The GS is absolutely meh compared to the 1st gen ones.
---
Pass and they didnt even make 2 greatswords like Sunrise/Twilight.
---
I just hope it is more achievement or event focused, like Luminescent or Bladed. Stuff like the 25 Superior Sigil of Nullification ruined Requiem Armor for me. I'm sure some don't mind those kinds of costs on armors, but I'd rather be playing the new content, doing collections, completing events, and gathering map currencies than just grinding money for arbitrary items.
---
Good seeing you again, Tybs. Have an [apple cider].
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Accurate
---
Looks like generic ugly fantasy greatsword with lots of extra shaders and effects. Seems like Aurene-themed.
---
dont know what aura it has.. but the skin is just looks like a gemstore skin.
---
Player: *doesn't create a group for dungeon*
---
Also player: No one does dungeons :(
---
I actually had a small panic about the next month part before I realized it's still technically April.
---
I was predicting Caithe's story this week along with a trailer next week before the episode in two. I won't say no to getting an additional teaser today though. It fits with ArenaNet's intent to spread things out to tide players over until the episode's release, such as the new bonus event.
---
I don't remember the exact source, but when the layoffs were first announced it was mentioned that staff would only be laid off from mobile projects of unspecified nature and GW2 would be unaffected. I would be surprised if it were a mobile port of the game, seeing as how processor-heavy it is (and the sheer number of people involved - porting the game would be a big project, but not half-the-studio big); more likely it was side content of some sort, or possibly an entirely new IP.
---
What's the biggest hammer skin in the game? Flames are appriciated
---
It's listed under the "returning this week" so won't be on sale yet!
---
We tested it a couple times, it was *almost* as good, but way harder. Buffing it too much might be a bad thing tbh, we got 25gph with a full organised squad and it's not fun gameplay.
---
for open world content, which is better for just running around/having fun for:
---
* mesmer - chrono or mirage?
---
* necro - scourge or reaper?
---
* rev - renegade or herald?
---
I don't plan on doing too much instanced content with these classes yet, just looking for variety in open world stuff. I have my ele, war and engi geared up for that already.
---
also, what's the best use of these heroic boosters or item boosters? should I just use them if I plan on doing a lot of open world stuff for a few hours, or is there a meta event or two where theyre really good?
---
The sad truth
---
Proper Sniper Soulbeast have 4sec of unblockable projectiles accessible very often.
---
Critical flaw here is we don't see your LFG posting for dungeons.
---
[ARENA NET] [Stephane Lo Presti.7258 posted on 2019-04-30 16:02:43](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/75198/the-living-world-season-4-finale-war-eternal-is-coming-to-guild-wars-2-next-month):
---
Especially if they’re smart enough to be using staff.
---
&gt; None of that is worthy of a ban however mass reporting automatically will cause a suspension or a ban which will be looked into by anet and huzzah it was properly looked into and OP only has to suffer the mandatory punishment for getting mass reported.
---
This is the biggest bollocks I have heard, you cant trigger a mandatory punishment by mass-reporting someone.
---
&gt;  read the edit and no there isn't anything to suggest they admitted to lying.
---
In his op he claimed:
---
&gt; I usually don't say anything offensive, don't have unfriendly relation ships, and don't remember any reason to be reported other than that.
---
In his Edit he writes:
---
&gt; Even if you're personally harassed outside game for unfair reason, don't try to avenge in the game.
---
In game they avenged alleged harassment that happened outside of the game. Meaning they harassed players inside the game. If they think their retaliation was justified or not is absolutely meaningless.
---
&gt; Lastly you're really reaching with your last paragraph and I can directly verify against that as his username here is one of his character names. If you properly read what I said before you'd know that I am in the same guild. So no there's no hiding and throwaway account type of things going on.
---
There is nothing posted on that reddit account and nothing he posted here verifies anything he claimed, especially not a biased guildie.
---
A double-bladed axe, now with sword plug-in.
---
Yea thats true. I need to look at the breakdown and focus on those elements instead of looking at it in totality. I dont have ascended gear yet so I should probably focus on that first.
---
Part of my hesitation is also that I love having alts, and dedicating resources to one set of gear kind of limits build options even on the same character, and that also deters me. But I should probably just bite the bullet and do it.
---
Hoooly shit, that's one well done cosplay. And it looks dope as fuck without the character reference, too.
---
Its a gayblade. Way, way to shiny, in the style of immortal/dominator sets.
---
I still think it's strange to have to struggle to teach players to use CC on a defiance bar and then have this fight where you suddenly don't want to.
---
Heart of the Mists is Light!
---
Still no date?
---
The other legendary greatswords are just paper thin skyboxes. This is a bit more meaty, while still being pretty high fantasy. This is the first time I really wish we could dye weapons, though. Its colors are going to limit its appeal greatly.
---
looks ugly :(
---
Is there actually any legendary that isnt a cheap looking glowstick?
---
I have like 4 or 5 character using GS and the only usable skins are Belindas, Cavalier and Balthazar.
---
I dont have much hope for immersive weapons skins or weapons that look like they could actually be used as, well weapons really.
---
But guis it takes us 9 months to make them we can't just add them. We gotta make sure they clip through on every race/gender. It's like making 60 armors feel sorry for us T\_T
---
With a decent group, you make more consistent gold daily than an hour long sw run.
---
Thanks again :D Im already training dodgeing but its hard for someone new to rpgs also there are do mamy animations which i dont know so i think it will come with time :)
---
Fashion Wars goal is to have the best looking armor you want. An expensive armor as the requiem one challenges you. If you have it, it is because you deserve it and you earn it by blood, sweat and long time.
---
Godsdamanit, the only GW nostalgia skin I'm missing since forever and they get ALL of them. HMPH.
---
These are the mouthebreathers that play soldiers warriors and shamans mirages and bullshit. They never sniff t4 and just downvote anything coordinated and meta
---
NA here as well. Message me if you still want someone to show you the ropes. In general, I think coming in with the understanding that this will be a better, more forgiving, less grind-y experience without traditional quests, is a good place to start.
---
that helps things make sense
---
As a Mesmer main with Eternity, I’m strongly considering making this one as well. This looks like it would go really well with my Shining Blade. I stocked up on all of the materials to resell (1K of each), but may end up just making this one.
---
Are you still looking for prize donations?
---
I would donate 15k gold to the winner squad, if all 15 squad members run core ranger builds.
---
They outright stated they wouldn't do combo Legendary weapons.
---
The armor reminds me of the [Crystal Arbiter Outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Arbiter_Outfit) a bit. Not a bad thing in my mind either.
---
I like the theme, I would have liked it even more if the new GS could be combined with eternity to add more to its effects.
---
I agree it is unlikely to not be in core tyria but if it is in core tyria.  He will only be able to move slowly like the warcat. And only fly and escalade in the mist.
---
Fractal "crystals" have a very different aesthetic
---
It's weirder considering the Berserker in GW barely uses brute weapons, if at all. He just burns things with a torch, might as well have called him Rioter or something...
---
For specific armor sets, you can search for it on the GW2 wiki and it will have a male and female picture for every race.
---
It's not the most convenient method though, tbh, but I don't personally know any method otherwise 
---
Example: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seeker_armor
---
Oh the warcat has different movement speeds in the different game modes? I hadn't played for a few months. I've only jumped in to live in sab for the 2 weeks then away again
---
My armor workshop had a 20+ year old hide that was going to be thrown out, made a gw1 map instead.
---
Well you could hardly call Ipos a glowstick.
---
Looks like trash.
---
Changing stats on ascended armor/weapons takes only a fraction of the cost/time as opposed to creating an entire new one.
---
Yeah, I usually run S+S/GS for open world, only swapping to S+S/+F for group content.
---
Oh man, just the *idea* of being able to roll up with Bolt and Exordium has me happy as can be.
---
When you put all the pieces together...Exodi*a* the Forbidden One?
---
Coo! Quaggan likes you~
---
WoW !! Really cool.
---
I can't speak to the first question because I don't do WvW on guard.  For the second question it's far cheaper to stat swap then it is to craft.  You're only using the exotic insignia not the ascended one in the forge. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing
---
I stopped playing for a while and now I see this. Ill stay off.
---
Heavy looks nice!
---
1) not enough WvW experience to speak honestly
---
2) in terms of pure gold? sometimes, it might be. What you do save on those is time and frustration. Where it really works out is when you're making gear sets like Viper's, or Trailblazer's, or other one Maguuma ones like that. You start off with something like dire, or rabid, or something where the inscription/insignia is cheap, and you just convert it, completely skipping over the jeweled damask patches, which are more expensive to buy, and take longer to craft because of the fulgurite requirement
---
You can use all that stuff for literally any other Gen 2 from Eureka and onwards.
---
And if anyone preps all the mats ahead of time to make it, I don't think they can complain about the looks. Pre-purchasing something before seeing it is your own fault. 
---
I say this as a person who consistently prep for each new legendary. I do it because it's about wanting to make each one - not for the looks. If it were, I'd wait and not commit anything. 
---
Even still, nearly every part you can sell on the TP unless you made the mystic tribute etc, so I still don't understand why you'd complain about saving only to be disappointed.
---
Thank you!! :)
---
You can also buy 1 chest of legendary shards for laurels per day.
---
Agreed, i for sure thought that Anet where going to make a gimmick greatsword, but it looks like it will be a nice weapon, will be good to get this one ingame, kinda glad ive been farming elder wood for months now LOL.
---
Chuka and Champawat doesn't glow at all, its footfalls are subtle, and doesn't scream "look at me" until you start shooting it. Usually it's too hectic to even notice effects like that in combat.
---
Everyone saying "it's not better than Sunrise/Twilight/Eternity!"
---
Well, obviously. Few things can beat the awe that is a portable skybox blade. But I don't think ANet was trying to one-up that trinity. This is just a *different idea.*
---
I like it. Combines cool elements from Aurene, Immortal weapons, and Dominator weapons. Plus the orange/blue scheme is lovely and almost feels tropical to some degree?
---
The animations look great, with some kind of mecha-anime kind of moving parts. I like the idea of it changing form based on what attacks you use.
---
I'm not sure if I'll get it myself. I really only have the resources for one Gen2 right now. And a lot of cool weapons to choose from. But this greatsword definitely feels like it fits in with the set nicely.
---
Its a rune sword from Runescape lol
---
I'll just reflect after a successful Mirage evade! Oh wait..  
---
It's not like reflect would save you against piercing. It just countered greedy meme pve builds.
---
and just the animations, that's it. the skin itself is medicore and so Mesmer looking :/
---
Nope, all you really need is projectile negation. Just like they said.
---
I mean, the knockback is just one arrow, why gimp your build when you can just, dunno, dodge? Pewpews usually aren't alone (or within 1200 range) either, so have fun breaking the stun and still eating all the rest while trying to catch up without dying to their buddies.
---
where is the rune?
---
I usually immediately buy the full packages for those mount sets, as I like them a lot and have many characters to use different skins.
---
But this one has 15 mounts, and the best way to buy 15 is ... a package of 15 !
---
Anet, what about your clients who bought the big package last week and have 2 mounts already ?! Where is the package of 13 ?
---
I guess this time I'll just not buy any, and wait for a sale, if ever.
---
Now i have to start playing to get another icon next to my name.
---
Do you daily, do you fractal dailys, do each world boss 1x, do each HoT meta 1x etc. That along will net you like a guaranteed 30-50g if you sell the things you get of value.
---
Gathering is also a very effective method of making money if you have lots of alts. Using optimized routes and taking advantage of rich nodes you can net hundreds of gold per day doing this if you are good at it and sell the collected mats effectively.
---
You can also just flip stuff on the TP, but again this is super boring and time consuming.
---
Seems most people hate it as they did Pharus initially, but am fascinated by the crisp and unexpectedly smooth look of this thing and I quite love the animations too. I will not judge it too harshly until it's in the game.
---
Fun is totally subjective, so you’ll have to decide that on your own. You can try out elite specs in the PvP lobby if you own an expansion. That can give you a sense of what you personally like more. 
---
I would use them when I want to level quickly. Stuff like exploration or killing lots of mobs stacked with food is typically good for that.
---
Use this link: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallery_of_hammers
---
Or the in game wardrobe system to preview and decide for yourself.
---
You can state your opinion but it cannot k.o. other people's opinions, so no, there's no need to repeat yourself.
---
Pharus is the best Legendary skin IMO.
---
Doesn't [Call of the Wild](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Call_of_the_Wild) add onto that as well?
---
Marksmanship also has permanent unblockable skill attacks.
---
It's not delusional - I do it almost every single day. I just did it today, again, and timed the whole damn thing.
---
Just because bad people downvote doesnt mean that good t4 fotm veterans dont clear in 30 minutes on average.
---
same thought here! really wish we could dye this thing
---
Missing texture would give me more hope.
---
"This guy likes something I don't, let's make fun of him for talking about it."
---
Nice.
---
yeah lol this is 2h lege and only adds a small aura to one arm like one handed weapons. normally, 2h lege weapons add whole aura cloud to entire character. the weapon doesnt have any particle effects either, it's just a coloured blade. definition of black lion skin. except its legendary so has few sparks.
---
What is making you think that stat swapping ascended gear is a huge time sink?
---
Patch comes out. I need to swap some of my Berserker pieces to Assassin's in order to maintain crit cap.
---
Assuming I wasn't going to use raid currency/fractal boxes, I could...
---
1. Go through the pain of crafting a new ascended item. It'll cost me like what, nearly 10 pieces of ascended crafting materials just for the one item? Plus a bunch of t6 mats, vision crystals so now I've gotta spend obsidian, etc...
---
2. Buy/craft an Orichalcum/Gossamer Assassin's Inscription/Insignia, grab 5 ectos, spend 10 spirit shards on the anthology of heroes, and throw those into the mystic forge.
---
Soooooooo much cheaper and faster to just stat swap 'em.
---
On the subject of the name of the weapon itself, “exordium” is definitely an intriguing word to us for the last second generation weapon. 
---
Google defines “exordium” as: the beginning or introductory part, especially of a discourse or treatise.
---
Pog
---
It's so cute!
---
a Dominator skin with more infusion and animations...that's it :/
---
I have no idea what that is.
---
I've played since launch and I'm finally pulling the trigger on gathering tools. It's my birthday and I want them. Are the Infinite ones a good choice?
---
Uh oh
---
*shakes magic 8-ball*
---
Very doubtful.
---
I assume the LS4 wrap-up trinket will be announced a couple of weeks or a month or so after. I wasn't around during LS3, but I vaguely recall Aurora coming out shortly after the finale but not during.
---
If Pegi is 12, she'd luvky shes not in America, because she has to be 13 to play there.
---
If I do then why are you begging for a date?
---
I also recommend using this tool in conjunction with the [Adoption Skin Organizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BE11ANO4bZpqpk26blwVMRMZriC1h8uG7_zG14qxwFc/edit?usp=sharing) if you want to go for a specific theme across the mount skins.
---
Hell im happy to have eternity now. I really don’t like this one
---
Take the top part and extend it to the hilt and call it a day,
---
Also remove the bottem spike etc.
---
Yes. You are the only one.
---
I need to see them footfalls Jawn!
---
rendering all the 100 people afking at la bank aint helping, drop then down
---
Yeah totally.
---
Oh man, I didn't even *think* about the footfalls. Oh please let us leave a little trail of crystals or something!
---
That means im unique? Awesome!
---
To be fair the Luminescent set was gem locked since you needed to buy the LWS2 to finish them.
---
Yea you're the only one bro.
---
I don't think anyone expected that. Twilight and Sunrise are probably the most creative sword designs in any game
---
When you get on the WvW maps, remember to ask for your servers discord or ts link :)
---
uniqueness isn't good in and of itself tho
---
i might not be a fan of the new GS but i still think it's better then a decorated stick
---
welcome to 2012
---
If you need Volatile Magic, then yes.
---
Yeah it was such a letdown especially since Zhaitan was one of the coolest looking monsters they made in this game. If ONE thing from the past absolutely needs a remake it would be that fight.
---
Scholar: It's simple geometry.
---
Berserker: This world will burn.
---
They rushed the final fight and it shows, they propably needed more time to figure out how to make epic boss fights back then. But heads up: the way they handled the bosses in HoT and PoF (and some Living World episodes) is way better.
---
no mention of new legendary trinket, only thing i hoped to see... meh
---
If those suspensions were correct, why were they reversed?  Also, I never said the numbers are worse, nor did I say they were better, I said we don't know.
---
- Guardians/mesmers/eles have a ton of projectile defense and most of it is also supportive (and mesmers have stealth).
---
- Warriors have quite a lot projectile defense (especially attached to the mace/shield and the shield trait).
---
- Thieves have a utility projectile wall, Dagger Storm and a lot of stealth.
---
- Revenants have projectile defense on their hammer, ventari, and a trait in retribution which activates on heal. Not to mention a fair bit of blocks/evades.
---
- Engis have relatively easy access to stealth and projectile defense.
---
- Necros don't have much but they have corrosive poison cloud (which is a utility and easily swapped in) and Reaper Shroud #2 destroys projectiles.
---
- Rangers can stealth and have projectile defense on their staff/axe.
---
Every class has a fairly easy way to deal with projectile spam while approaching.
---
WoodenPotatoes misses a lot of things, tbh. Which leads to a lot of false theories that his fanbase takes as facts. A big part of why I dislike his videos.
---
I'd bet a nut it's the 20th, right at the end of the "supply drop"
---
So this is 5 years old now, but at launch this fight was rushed out the door to be ready for the opening of the servers. 
---
There was apparently a 2nd stage of this fight, after you grounded the dragon, but it was cut due to time constraints. 
---
Also, Todays Tequatl champion battle is not the tequatl encounter of launch, nor is the Shatterer, those encounters used to be "stand on the dragon's foot and swing sword til dead" until they got reworked over time. 
---
I 100% doubt that they'll ever go back and Adjust the final mission for the core storyline.
---
dropped to medium and getting 60 in Lion's Arch. Seems good to me. Any idea what's the difference in term of number of model between medium/high/highest ?
---
We will have to agree to disagree about that.  But, zelda is a terrible example because the latest one had a shit ton of micromanaging (armor that makes you better at climbing mounts vs combat vs all sorts of other stuff).  But yeah, I get your point, and I do indeed enjoy the simple, sit down and play, approach of those games.
---
Well I got rich and bought a house by just farming and crafting (doing work over time) in FFXIV.
---
Thank you very much!
---
notice that there's some sort of floating thingy above the yellow WP too.
---
wonder if its like a temporary WP that appears during a specific stage of a meta?
---
Why are most legendaries just ugly sparkle weapons.
---
Anet should have gone for the hilt
---
Your post will spend much more time being the correct 
---
tense than the incorrect tense.
---
i'd personally prefer it to be a bit more Aurene colored.
---
I wouldn't conclude one from the other. There might still be underwater content, just probably not a ton of it... 
---
The main reason they decided to cut out on the underwater legendaries, if I am correct, is that the time is better invested into land legendaries, as they are much more relevant to the existing playerbase. And yes, overland content will always be in the majority.
---
&gt; I expected him to drag us down as well, forcing a huge ground battle with all the races of tyria combining their might to take down a dragon that’s been terrorizing them for years.
---
Yep. That mission was supposed to happen, but it was never finished.
---
They probably banned them because they were used on the same computers the actively rule-breaking ones used, as is mentioned explicitly in what I copy pasted. That banwave caught people by using software that looked at what individuals had running on their computers, so it's pretty unlikely that any of the bans were false bans outside of the people who had the blank processes (which is a good way to hide yourself from what software you're using) and those that had cheat engine on that they used in unrelated games.
---
extremely easy to top either one of them, especially Sunrise.
---
I have never been a fan of either one.
---
No, it came out with the rest of episode 6. But it wasn't teased at all, it just appeared in our collections tab.
---
First of all, I have no clue what glyphs are. I have 3 unlimited tools on one character and I can’t justify gathering with a different character until they make the tools shared (which they never will). So I get to tap one map worth of nodes before I move on to the next. The whole crafting/gathering process is complete garbage in this game.
---
Aurora wasn't teased at all either.
---
Okay so as someone who is very dumb and has never fucked with legendary crafting before: what does this mean, and how much should I focus on this if i really really ***really*** want an Exordium?
---
Get multiple accounts. It'll pay off in the long run and be the most efficient time to gold conversion by far.
---
all i know - lowest in terms of quality means no one but you, while low adds few more ppl
---
and for quantity, you can just stand in crowded area and see for yourself how people disappear (hide player names for most effect)
---
Drink up!
---
Belinda's Greatsword and some of the BL chest ones  are my favorites in the game.
---
Otherwise...reclaimed or Aureate look amazing with the right character aesthetic.
---
I’m sorry, what? Let’s artificially increase difficulty by requiring infusions to not die when just standing. Got all infusions to 150? Cool, you earned the right to press 1111111111
---
I like it the way it is.  I'd imagine it went through several design iterations.  It has a really nice draw effect that really wouldn't match a traditional sword-hilt design.
---
Next month could be tomorrow
---
How many ghost pepper nodes are in Orr? I would need a stack of peppers to make 30 gold-ish
---
I find the map incredibly interesting so far. You have the mist theme with floating islands, the strange sci-fi surface as seen in the trailer, ghosts (?), the fact that they are home to the Skyscale, and, also, really weird and alien looking machinery. (It's in the background of one of the Mistshard armor sets.)
---
PS~~N~~A: Last Tuesday of may is 28th
---
It's not currently available. It will almost certainly come back eventually, but there's no way to obtain it until it comes back.
---
I still get them from killing mobs in Jahai (Pulsing Brandsparks and Congealeds, too); IIRC, they just took them off the Salvage mat list.
---
Probably the first "Mask-type" medium armor set that i've been interested in getting.
---
I don't know.  I'm not so sure.  Whether I like it or not will have a great deal to do with how you acquire it and more importantly, how many dye panels it'll have.  I think 2-3 dye panels has potential.
---
Oh you're right!
---
They are not grateful to us players for playing because they still make butt capes.
---
The color scheme makes it look like a mess but on the other hand a still image isn't always a good representation and the short clips are not much better.
---
We'll probably have it when we'll get the actual trailer with the date. I'm surprised we had text in a teaser actually.
---
ok, gemstones and curios is 1k a lot.
---
This may not be a give-away answer, but /u/that_shaman has hinted at map locations in the past based on his datamining finds and made posts to twitter with those hints.
---
He recently tweeted this photo: https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1120761833063895047 
---
which shows the gate south of Mt. Maelstrom.
---
Underworld has insane night capping at 2 am to 6 am everything and I mean EVERYTHING is blue they are ticking with 400-460 points no change to do anything with a small 5-8 group
---
I never said I don't care?
---
You can have 50 wrong people say something, doesn't make it correct.  Numbers =/= validity.
---
As for my replies, i am trying to make clear this isn't some showcase of skill but a meme video where the timing made me laugh. I though the music choice and editing would make this obvious.
---
Evidently, my humour is often lost on this subreddit, which is fine. I do question though if I should make content in the future because as much as people like to say "Gw2 could use more content creators", the community on this reddit at least is largely very resistant to anything that isn't popular opinion already, or a screenshot of a random vista.
---
I have no clue what people would like to see, so I have given up that and merely put things here in case anyone would like to see it. If you don't, fair enough. I don't see though how you expect me to ignore things I deem incorrect or false when I have put effort into making the video in the first place.
---
Eclipse actually appears (when PC is riding this dragon mount) as well in this teaser.
---
You said toner rather than timer.
---
Luckily I finished my need for it, a few days ago :p
---
all you said is when it comes out...
---
Cauliflower armor. It's time.
---
reminds me of those pull out telescopes that you always see captains use on ships in the movies. But in toy sword form.
---
Ah thank you!
---
Thank you!
---
Woah, I need to get on this level o-o
---
I did the same with alt 1-5 but when I got griffin and warclaw and it went to alt 1-7 my brain collapsed and was somehow incapable of remembering two additional numbers so I started using the radial menu.
---
Was there ever a character slot promotion? Should I wait for one (I don`t need a new character RIGHT now) or is it pretty rare?
---
Yeah that was in the patch notes, however since then ive no longer had them from map completion of a core PoF Map =]
---
Yeah I'm really intrigued too, I have no idea where it could be on the world map ! Where were the ghosts, I didn't see them?
---
Oh and I think the background of the Mistshard armor is just the interior of a classic airship
---
1) For WvW support, you want Minstrel's. For PvE support, you want Diviner/Harrier/Minstrel's depending on the situation. Mostly not Minstrel's for PvE though.
---
2) Keep in mind that you need an ascended insignia to create the gear, and only exotic to change the stats. Spend some time with the crafting breakdown calculator on [Gw2Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com). For example, Maklain's Visor is 55g while Zojja's is 44.7g, and that's just one piece of armor, not 6.
---
PS: Zojja's isn't the cheapest either, but it's fairly cheap and you presumably already have the recipes.
---
The [Claw of the Khan-Ur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Claw_of_the_Khan-Ur) has an [on-crit effect](https://youtu.be/o4DhSrr6vZc?t=111) as well.
---
If it's like the LS3 nodes its 24 hours and not just reset.
---
You are shooting out tigers though ...
---
Howler. It's presence is barely noticeable.
---
Is it the weapon spinning or the spinning of it using the mesmer greatsword skills?
---
That is currently unknown since they only showed throwing and mesmer AA.
---
That is the real question. Waited 5 days for map reset, event was bugged for complete my legendary weapon.
---
You are delusional...
---
The engine is relatively old and the game doesn't profit too much from your graphics card or multiple CPU cores.
---
If you don't mind some graphic bugs you should try the add-on d9d12pxy, which ports it to direct x 12 and improves the performance a lot.
---
Copying build advice from my PM since I figure it'd be nice to have it available to others:
---
There are several websites that give different builds for different content, but \[Metabattle\]([https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle\_Wiki](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki)) is a good place to start. It's the only one with open world builds and it has sections for every game mode, but those may not be as up to date and are usually just copied from the other build sites. \[Here\]([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior\_-\_Axe/Axe\_Arms](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Axe/Axe_Arms)) is the one closest to what I run on my warrior in open world. I find it very effective, and its play style is very close to one of the more popular raid builds (although that may change soon given changes to warrior in the most recent patch).
---
For the most part, against weaker enemies you will just stay in axe/axe. I find that most normal mobs will die to a combo of axe 4 -&gt; axe 2 -&gt; axe 5 and it's all AoE so you can get groups down pretty quick. Against tougher enemies like champions, dungeon creatures, or world bosses, the build centers around maintaining two damage buffs: Peak Performance ("PP" strength trait - tier 1) which triggers whenever you use a Physical utility skill and Berserker's Power ("BP" strength trait - tier 3) which triggers every time you f1. As long as you f1 off cooldown you'll have 100% uptime on BP, but PP is short enough that you want to time it to match up with your stronger skills, axe 5 in particular. 
---
In a typical fight you'll want to fill adrenaline (the axe trait in discipline makes this quick as long as you have some Precision on your gear), use your physical skill (kick or bolas, will explain later), f1, then go into your axe 4/2/5 combo while PP is up. You then mostly "filler" auto attack, maybe using axe 2 if there are many enemies or axe 3 if your target's health is low, until f1 is back up. Use f1 normally and go back to filler. By the time f1 is back up your physical skill and axe 5 should have recharged again and you can repeat the loop.
---
In terms of kick vs bolas, it mostly comes down to if your target has a break bar or not. You may have seen several enemies, usually champions or world bosses, with a second bar under their health bar that's either blue or looks like its covered in gray armor. Control effects like stuns and knockdowns work differently on these enemies; if the bar is armored, they're completely immune but if it's blue it acts like a second "health bar" that is only damaged by control effects; the more powerful the control the more "break bar damage" it does. Once this second health bar is depleted, the enemy is usually stunned and takes more damage for a time. This can be a nice boot towards killing the monster, but for many bosses this becomes especially important because if they aren't broken the boss will use particularly powerful skills (temporary immunity, extremely high damage attacks, etc). 
---
If you know you're going up against a strong enemy like this you should take kick: it deals a good amount of break bar damage and has more charges so is more forgiving if you accidentally use it too early. For normal enemies, however, kick has a knockback effect that may push them out of your damage combo, or out of attacks coming from other players not anticipating the kick. In this case, bolas work better. As a side note, when a break bar turns blue is when you'll also want to temporarily weapon swap to mace/mace, which can do a lot of control with 3/5/f1. Once the bar is broken, you can then swap back to axe/axe and do you big damage combo, taking advantage of the damage bonus on the broken enemy.
---
Needs more Cantha
---
Very early on there was an article where they said gen2 will not have underwater weapons. On the other hand this was also back when they were still doing collections for them.
---
I remember looking at the value of this vs. other ways to spend your laurels and it was not great. Better to convert your Laurels to gold and then buy the parts to craft this if you want to be efficient. If you just happen to have thousands of Laurels to spend then yeah why not start collecting that way I guess.
---
Oof, I was asleep. Forgot Underworld isn't national. The ideal pairing for the German servers might be against other German servers, but international servers have been know to come knocking when we sleep. French and Spanish servers have Caribbean and south American defenders, who can play at these hours.
---
If only I can get nvidia drivers to work in Linux
---
Forget about Ele; Daredevil bird's scaled with the enemy's size. It was fun to hit bosses with that stick.
---
Yet I sense some insubordination !
---
Nice try, but no.
---
And all those NPC on skimmer, and Anet releasing a new premium skin mount for skimmer, coincidence ?
---
all 8 linux gamers thank you!
---
I'm out of loop, what does yellow waypoint mean? Is it malfunctioning?
---
I'm surprised they don't reset map instances at reset or midnight every day. Or even give each map instance a timer to the maximum amount of time it can stay open.
---
That's a really good find. The area below Mt. Maelstrom looks like it would fit what we've seen of the map so far.
---
So can you choose whatever you want or does it do it at random The post is kind of contradicting
---
So basically .... basic greatsword skin and the different color variations. Slightly fancier would be the cavalier greatsword.
---
The same as all the other gen2 legendaries.  You could follow the recipe for Sharur but replace the Tribute to Arah with whatever the Tribute is for this one.
---
but I don't want purple text ...
---
what settings and res?
---
looks good though. seems to be way better than i see with Gallium 9 :/
---
God damn that music. Giving me Halo chills.
---
It is still a ton of fun to do.
---
Pretty much the same.  But this is initial support. Expect big optimizations during the next months.
---
They should give Nornies hairstyle like the one Owlington has.
---
Wow, three hours worth of wooden potatoes content right here.
---
Ah I see, that blows. Thanks man!
---
damn i love you guys!
---
See, and I've been waiting years for them to release a sword that doesn't look like a mirror on a stick. Maybe even something with a *blade* to it instead of a paddle of star-stuff. So I'm hyped :)
---
that's good to hear. i don't know why my frames on Gallium 9 are so poor. :(
---
I think it's a bit of both? I probably phrased that wrong, I meant moreso how the parts shift around the main blade, they probably don't spin on the other classes lol. That being said I'm glad it's not as flashingly bright as Pharos, the unique animations in this one stole my heart 😄
---
Yes that's how you get it. Its a legendary greatsword.. It will be just like all the rest of the 2nd gen weapons since Eureka. No collection and just a list of Mystic curio's / Mystic tribute / gift and precursor. Thats literally been the M.O ever since. Ofc no one knows what you'll need until it release... and as such... IT HAS NOT RELEASED YET. Therefore.. you have to wait until the next Living story release date... which is what i said ...
---
I made this a while ago and just found it. Thought it'd be funny to post it now, maybe.
---
I mean... have you read them?  OLD Holmes was somewhat a high functioning sociopath.
---
Was this on a Sunday night during Game of Thrones?
---
There is 2 gem store items. One is cheap, and gives you a random skin from the collection, while the other is expensive, and lets you pick a specific one.
---
The "Select License" is the expensive one and lets you pick, while the "Adoption License" is the cheap random one. Nothing contradicting about it.
---
Well "beginning of a narrative" already makes some sense to me.
---
If we do get a replacement for Kralkatorrik and kill him this time (be it resurrected Aurene or dues ex mcguffin newbie replacement) we're at the beginning of the story of a new Elder Crystal Dragon.
---
Alternatively, if they play this into the plot akin to The Shining Blade this may be some mcguffin akin to the Dragonsblood Spear (made from Glint's corpse perhaps?) Or may even be the weapon Vlast talked about in his memory crystals (I still say the description doesn't match the spear, that thing could not shape the world or let mortals do a dragon's true work (balancing magic)). Thus the name could be referring to it being the beginning of a narrative we hopped onto midway: Glint's.
---
Or something else entirely....
---
We have a lot of crystal themed outfits, not armors. And it's not like we weren't going to have a crystal themed reward set of some type given the theme of the patch.
---
Also sometimes, with a little lucky, you can get 6\~8g just doing that. Opening one The Pact Scout Mapping Materials can give you 10 materials insted of 1.
---
This item cost Karma, so I assume you got some.
---
&gt; I wonder if any other skill will also see some visual changes other than trails or projectiles.

I actually just went there (as I noticed the wiki didn't have an article for that beacon object), and it was contested. The yellow flashes on an off (the teal beam does come from the beacon though); this contrasts to the trailer where it's a solid yellow.
---
But this may just be ArenaNet creating a new type of contested waypoint, one where it isn't contested due to event progression or the like.

Also known as Horrordium
---
I appreciate your workaround and you make a valid suggestion, but should 10minutemail *need* to exist? I’d prefer companies just act ethically.
---
Your claim was less than 1% failure rate.  A difficult feat, that requires real effort on Anet's part to achieve.  So after seeing these 67 bans which were reversed within days of the initial ban, do you still feel confident with your claim? Remember, out of the remaining 1000+ people, only 14 had to have been falsely banned and not make a forum thread for your claim to be false.  I'm not saying it is false, only that we don't have numbers to prove it.
---
Good point.  I forgot about karma cost.  Karma is pretty easy to come by though.  I guess instead of a free daily, it’s more like a daily karma-gold converter.
---
Yep, another 10 hours of substance from 4 months of development time. Are people seriously content with this?
---
Compared to other Gen 2 legendaries like Astralaria it's even worse.
---
I have to disagree , I think it's great. And the tools don't need to made duplicate , that's what shared inventory slots are for. And glyphs are like runes , except for tools . You just said you have unbreakable tools , you haven't noticed the very obvious glyph slot in them ?
---
thanks a lot for the info!
---
This ^
---
Lets hope the precursors at least look good.
---
No. This world is an illusion, exile.
---
It becomes very obvious that you are in the same instance if you do a lot of gathering. 
---
&gt; Opening a new map on a schedule may help to clear up an existing stalled event, but it does nothing to prevent that same stall from happening again - if there's a bug in the code itself, that bug will keep happening every time the event spawns until the code is corrected, no matter the map instance.

That is true up to a point. A lot of the bugs seems to be a result of race conditions such as a mob being killed before it triggers the next sequence of event. The race outcome won't be the same each time. Obviously it would  be better to fix the underlying bug but those fixes seems to be very low priority.
---
T4 dailies in half an hour is easily doable, though to get significantly below that, you'd probably need a decent static. I don't see much of a reason to believe that guy's lying. It's all about group comp and people capable of properly executing their roles.
---
Something pointy instead of "slap your enemies to death".
---
I am tempted to come back to the game just to make that greatsword, goddamn.
---
Finally a legendary greatsword that doesn't look like it was drawn by a 2nd grader with a texture slapped on.
---
What all is available from the voucher, out of curiosity? Is there a list I can look at outside of game?
---
Yeah, I remember r2h’s looking like, well, a blue stick.
---
My main commander has been doing that since the first dragon. He’s just in full dragon looking gear now, though since Aurene he’s tamed back a little and matched her colour scheme (I’m yet to get to episode 5 tho so this could change again from what I’ve picked up trying to avoid spoilers)
---
&gt; Mistshard Armor
---
&gt; Yellow Waypoint
---
So that's it, then. By killing Aurene, Kralkatorrik made her more powerful than he can comprehend. She's in the Mists now and can compete with him on his level. And we're going to the Mists too.
---
Why not? And why should we not expect the same standard as gen 1?
---
Exactly what I expected, a purple-ish, crystal themed GS :) while I am pretty happy with my Sunrise and wont make this one, I still think it fits very well in the roster of legendaries.
---
It will probably pait very well thematically with Mesmers, but also guardians or maybe even rangers/druids, and is also combines well with other rainbow legendaries like bifrost or minstrel.
---

...you know what, I understand your decision paralysis now, jesus.
---
Kinda annoyed that yet again GS gets the huge amount of attention/work no other weapon gets for its goddamn 4th legendary weapon by getting its own specific animations added in.
---
I would strongly recommend using a distro focused on desktop alone. Specifically Manjaro, Solus, or Pop!\_OS are great bets. Pop!\_OS is mostly a stripped down Ubuntu that includes the latest stable Nvidia drivers (Ubuntu does not usually) and is maintained by a Desktop/Laptop OEM vendor
---
I have to say, the other colours come from the beacon thing below the waypoint, but still. A contested/malfunctioning have the same yellow, but it flashes on and off (a bit like electric sparks).
---
This is why I love GW2. Life has me too busy to play a lot these days, but I really like relaxing and doing a WB train, so this could be a great way for me to log back on and have a bit of fun. 
---
Way better than Destiny 2's "blink and you'll miss it" model at least.
---
I had forgotten about that!
---
I guess I'll add this to my list of reasons I believe it'll be Scavenger's Causeway.
---
Does anyone know, if I choose the Executioner's Outfit, will I also get the axe toy?
---
Still need the underwater ones.

i think short version of your post is: ANET wasnt trying.
---
you kidding me?  what better way to remember her than to immortalize her as a weapon of legend.
---
just like with tree-man and his twig.
---
Welcome to 7 years ago. The game evolve and that fight compared to a fight with a dragon just recently will blow your mind how good that was. Arena Net learned along the way and you just need to keep on doing the stories and you will see how they grow for each story to come.
---
Going straight into T4s might be a bit too expensive for someone who buys gold for crafting with real money. But building up to full ascended equip is a really worthwhile endeavor for any newish player imo. CMs+T4 are just a really good way to earn some gold and also gives you tons of free ascended equip for your other characters.
---
For your first character's ascended equip there are also quite some alternatives to crafting. There's free ascended equip from achievements, some can be bought with laurels or living world map currencies and probably other ways I can't think of right now.
---
Anyone get this to work successfully? I can't get it to work the installer crashes before, well, installing. This would imply that there are missing windows libs needed for the installer to work. I'll stick with the WINE build maintained by a community member on the Guild Wars 2 forums (he's also adding d9vk to his build soon)
---
usual gold run is  dailies for 2g, then daily T4 fracs with cms (if you're fast enough its probably the most efficient time/gold), then probably dungeon run or HoT meta event VB-&gt;TD-&gt;AB.  Some people do silverwastes but its way too boring for me and others just flip items on the trading post. 
---
Overall if you're not doing fracs, you're basically skipping the biggest gold source in the game atm. Dungeons runs are good with a fast static but with pugs usually takes way too long and it can be tedious to actually fill the group with decent players. U could also buy daily pact map materials (dont remember the name) and use them all when frostgorge sound gets the nice map reward although t6 have dropped down in price significantly.
---
It looks like this new GS can transform itself based in the attack animation.  
---

---
And we have to wait to see the others.
---
Ye, kinda regret buying that package.. Had to awkwardly buy 2 sets of 5 then 3 more..
---
This sounds frustrating. Sorry I can't help at all.
---
Rune is a type of metal in Runescape. I think it's *technically* called Runite or some shit like that.
---
But you also use actual runes to cast spells.
---
The two have nothing to do with each other at all. Yes, it's weird.
---
If there were ever a chai themed raid wing, that’s about the area I’d expect to see it.  Other than that, I suspect we would only if we need to revisit the jungle for some lore reasons around containing magic.
---
I say this and people get mad.
---
The Mist Shard armor sets are all previewed while inside a stock airship. You can even go look inside [the one in LA](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phoenix_Dawn).
---
To their credit, they've put a lot of work into making the game *look* good.
---
Almost as much work as they've put into microtrasactions.
---
Why would we need an indian tea themed raid?
---
It's okay to be right it's okay to be an asshole, you just can't be right and an asshole.

For Cantha of course. ;\^)

[A dev stated it in the post for the first set of gen 2 legendaries.](https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3oguoe/hot_new_legendary_weapons/cvx4mgy/)
---
Granted, that was 3 years ago, and you're free to expect what you want, but there were never any hints to the contrary.
---
Yea, but it doesn't glow brightly. If you werebt shooting it, it'd be harder to spot in a crowd. Even if wielded.
---
Are there any other similar perks on other outfits?
---
You should've removed the blade and pitch it as a cool looking axe idea :x
---
Twigman Longbody: Branch of Legends.
---
We been knew, sis
---
Probably not, since a part of that area is already Rata Novus. A small part, but what else is there that would be interesting?
---
lolwhat?
---
Just saying, your claim to know what everyone's exactly talking about isn't accurate. Though I do admit it wasn't said in the most polite way possible.
---
Imagine if when you use an attack that spins it transforms in to a big axe to chop your enemies? ^Hey ^Eternity, ^you ^can't ^do ^that!
---
I need woodenpotatoes to give a 2 hour analysis of the yellow waypoint
---
Point of order, Grog uses a Greataxe, a warhammer, or a talking greatsword.
---
Just a little thing, but Rose is Josh's mother, not his wife.
---
True, but there's a vast difference between "these people are all so skilled that we lose 500-5" and "hey, there's a good player on their team I should avoid and/or learn from."
---
I've seen thieves do this before, too. This is caused by lag, but it very consistently only shows up only fighting good roamers, so I'm not sure if it's something they are abusing on their end.
---
This is because it's the only thing we can't make more of.
---
They are. You'll need lots of volatile magic for living world skins and home nodes, and once you've got your home nodes, they in turn benefit from the tools.
---
I'm actually glad it's not something that caught my eye right away, I've been using Caladbolg for a couple years now and making a legendary seems way too daunting for me. Now if the sword had some sort of dragon/crystal theme...
---
Yeah, but a WoW player isn't thinking about that. This is something a lot of GW2 players forget over time. The grind in other MMOs is usually to just get good enough gear to farm the latest map. I didn't need to get \*Ombre Exceptional\* gear to be able to explore Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Necromancer
---
That last teleport looks a little sketchy since it isn't accompanied by any particle effects. 
---
Otherwise, though, it seems fairly legit. Mirages have no shortage of teleports by way of the standard blink, Mirage Elite [Jaunt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jaunt), and a few other tricks that might be easily mistaken as teleports, such as using clones and stealth, then reappearing at a further location, or just other relocation effects from other skills (Portals, Mirage Advance, Axes of Symmetry, etc.)
---
Not core ranger, but maybe 4 druid 4 sb 4 core :thinking:
---
DUH JAUNT!
---
You linked the repo for VK9 instead of D9VK. Link should be this onehttps://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk
---
ty. It looks pretty close imho. The biggest difference is the center blue beam, but this one apparently comes from the structure below. Most waypoints don't have that ground structure.
---
Yeah, [charr on a skimmer definitely screams far-northeastern Ascalon.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/7/71/Olmakhan_Earthstalker_%28male_skimmer%29.jpg) /s
---
I can't resist. MO's excuse just feels so incredibly weak now that they will have put out at least two (three if you count Requiem, more than that if this new armor set has a "prestige" version like that as well) almost back-to-back.
---
I use the heroic dragonsblood greatsword and I feel like a badass with it.
---
Axe was obliterated.. nobody should be using axe in pvp now. Mirage is up 1 target break with it's CD increased to 35 seconds. idk I'm not having an issue.
---
Most people here are recommending the equivalent of chump change. 20 gold for this, 8 gold for that...that's all pocket change.
---
You need to play the Trading post. That is literally it. Just like in real life, you make money on the market, not by breaking your back like a mine worker.
---
Yeah but why bother with armor sets then instead of separate pieces?

Yea Runite is the ore and its used to craft Rune weapons / armor. You mine rune essence to craft runes used to cast magic. It's not your typical "Rune" per se.

Recs are a daily, they are fractals, and multiple times I've had someone say "no recs?" after an LFG said "dailies". It's ANet's fault for making daily content that's named differently than dailies.

Not sure why you're being downvoted, this is the most efficient way to convert TIME into gold (because no matter the method, everything on this page boils down to converting time).
---
That sounds too good to actually happen
---
I appreciate the feedback, so in your opinion has the P/P burn engineer build worked for yourself? Im trying to go for optimal farm, but not get nuked by enemies also at the same time burning things down is so satisfying. Not saying Im an arsonist or anything. 🤪

Report back once you got to ep5.

Some Aura tech somewhere is equally terrified and excited

Hey, we got real trousers just a while ago! Time for another half-decade of butt capes.

They are? I thought I saw something different for a second or two. Thanks for correcting me.
---
Keybind the "Special Action Key" you get in Fractals or with some Raidbosses so you don't need to click it.
---
Also keybind your dodgeroll since dodging while pressing double movement buttons gives you like half a second delay and that really kills you in certain cases, certain bossmechanics wich happen quickly.
---
Also keybind "target-next-target" and "target-nearest-target" so you don't need to manually click your foes.
---
I thought that was a raid wing.
---
I don't do raids.
---
It breaks my heart that I love the greatsword. Eternity had a special place in my heart all these years. I'm a faithless bastard.
---
Asuaka.1528
---
Loot. Good.
---
Yeah, a lot of temple-related achievements got changed to work with defense. That was a huge help.
---
? its a game play video
---
I have to try this ! Never thought about it.
---
Out of my 4 world completions, I liked power daredevil the most. With its mobility, strong staff autos, and lack of weapon skill cooldowns, you can chain kill scattered mobs for heart quests VERY quickly. Shadow Refuge is useful for channeling HPs uninterrupted as well.
---
Apologies Mr. Morwra, that was my error. I respectfully withdraw my point of order.

Pretty sure the Pharus crit lightning is client side only.  Still cool but yeah.

PeerBlock is a free and open-source personal firewall that blocks packets coming from, or going to, a maintained list of black listed hosts. So those who use it need to allow listed ip-s to be able to play this game.

Have you tried contacting support? This thread is answered by players.

Okay, that cleared it up a lot for me, thanks! I'll go berserker, focus on the bursts, and see how it goes :)
---
This trend with legendaries I am really disliking. Gen 1 legendaries used to be about aesthetic looks and not too shabby on eyes animations, subtle but pleasant. Gen 2 legendaries look like glorified poop with over the top animations and sacrifice all that aesthetic value.
---
Wall!
---
masterRCchief.3641
---
well that explains OP's first sentence, any idea about the rest?
---
I swear to god Ad Infinitum is one of the most obnoxious things they've but into the game
---
It'll be easy to match the theme, with the new armor and the three outfits and Herald shoulders and a few other things. Getting a Glint blue with highlights of Vlast orange could be interesting.
---
we have  80% armors with spikes XD
---
I think most hype is coming from a confirmation of release date than the weapon and armor reveal.
---
That's an interesting direction to take from a legendary that's not confirmed to relate to story; thematically it does, like most gen2 legendaries, but the only legendary to be part of lore thus far is The Shining Blade (and arguably Claw of the Khan-Ur).
---
Love the design, guess i'll start saving some gold now
---
Wow, quite some time, yes you did right, well all I'm left to do, unfortunately, is wish you good look, which I do.
---
On the plus side you can craft any of the other gen 2 legenndaries now with a bit if selling on the TP. Scepter, focus, horn are all quite cool.
---
And what armor does a scholar wear?  Berserker's!
---
Oh. Yeah that's kind of busted. ._.

I had eveything to build this GS. I've been waiting for it since the begenning of the G2. But now I'm so desappointing. It looks like a gemstore skin. Too many colors, and the effects are very ugly. Looks so childish ans even pro, not even a real thing. I will see it in the game, but I  don't have many hopes. It's too much for me.
---
I feel like there's a greatsword that looks like this in the game already
---
Let's have a giggle at the fact that OP's edit says "le War"
---
If only Greatsword was equally great for Mesmer.  =P
---
Fixed, thank you. VK9 creator also made some nice contributions too thou.
---
Not maintenance mode, but the studio was spread out across several projects, with a small crew bringing us the living world episode. Now that the layoffs happened and the projects were shelved/terminated, GW2 is getting a lot more workforce and attention again.
---
I've been running them on my site also. Josh has been a big inspiration to me for quite some time.
---
I've yet to pick up the book, but soon.
---
IIRC, Aurora didn't get a mention either in One Path Ends's trailer, so there's hope.
---
Eventually, the hero just switched to easy mode and never told his friends
---
We need another potatoe crisis. This can help
---
To be fair, the layoff situation would have put a huge hindrance. They also no doubt added a bit of time in order to make sure it's as good as possible.
---
It feels like they're putting in a lot of effort to avoid showing off the map. We really have only seen inside an airship, a single angle of a cave and a swamp, and then a 360 degree shot of a coastal cliffside. Other trailers showed a plethora of different locations in the maps.
---
So maybe there's something awe inspiring about the map. Or it's as barren as Domain of Kourna.
---
Daredevil and herald are both quite nice. Daredevil has tons of mobility and strong aoe damage. Herald can just passively turn on powerful boons and damage buffs and run around with not a care in the world.
---
Did they create some new tech to create armors? They always said it would be so resource intensive to make them and now they put out armors pretty regularly. I don t complain about it. I am just interested how they can now make them so fast.
---
cantha confirmed
---
I'm not sure how long the timer should be, but I wouldn't mind it to happen every reset. I can see the merit of some maps being on a shorter one though.
---
What? You don't run around with two Legendaries out?
---
An unbelievable amount of mithril ore.
---
TOTALLY done; it was mentioned sometime 2016/2017 no gen3 legendaries EVER.
---
Fake link ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING VERY WELL
---
:D
---
Cool, free stuff! Thanks!
---
&gt;more achievement or event focused
---
At launch, this would be great. But months or years down the line, it becomes harder to get the armor set.
---
Agreed, finally a comic with good art on this sub.
---
Imagine being in 2k19 and still being a parasite :LUL:
---
Some of us like supporting the websites that give us such incredibly useful tools.
---
From what we've seen, I'm thinking this map will either be northern Dajkah or between Mount Maelstrom and Desert Highlands. There's a lot of Elonian aesthetics, but there's one area which looks Maguuma-like, and Mount Maelstrom does use Maguuma assets. But northern Dajkah seems likely because we see charr on skimmers.
---
I'm personally hoping for west of Desert Highlands so it connects PoF to Core via Judgment Rock long unused portal.
---
That's Fahrunah, for the Episode 1 a story. Maps never reveal early like that.
---
I don't see why you think the new zone is in the Mists. We see a lot of Elonian aesthetics. A coastal cliffside. The inside of an airship. Some asuran aesthetics curiously, and some Maguuma plantlife. But nothing else that really suggests in the Mists.
---
Maybe the yellow WP are a "mists-version" of the new map? Same map, but a different instance or something
---
It looks Glint colored to me, with a hint of Vlast colors. Seems fitting to me.
---
Or it could be something like Siren's Landing, where there are special "waypoints" on the map you have to buy to use.
---
love the new Sonic trailer :)
---
Yep. Looks like a glorified dominator greatsword skin to me. Definite pass.
---
It's a waypoint that ports you between the Mists and Tyria. ...Maybe.
---
Hmm, can't. The OEM won't support beta drivers in their repos. I could add Ubuntu graphics drivers ppa, but then I'd lose the optimizations that system76 added for power mgmt as their ppa and the Ubuntu gfx drivers ppa conflict
---
&gt; Just skip the gold ore and plants
---
Gold ore is worthless, some plants are not. Jungle Plants, Ghost Peppers, and Truffles come to mind. Mussels for that rare chance at a pearl, too.
---
I teach the game to a lot of new players. I even have a player named New Player Helper. IF you're a free to play player, I have to add you before you contact me. If you've paid for the game, add me on Vayne.8563. Logging in now.
