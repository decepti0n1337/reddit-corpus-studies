Meme also works rather well for Morhou when your focused on who your fighting and all of the sudden some wanker snipes you.

Reminds me of all the Hearthstone streamers saying they'd quit for Artifact. Lmao.

IF one is new you have to show you are willing to learn. If you ask and you at least have exotics with the proper prefixes and a decent build and watched the fight on youtube that really show people you give a shit.

Yea, you can say no subscription, but still fact remains, kind of sucks there are no rewards for actually playing the game. You have raids and CM, but then there isnt really anything special for it. Compare to most MMOs where you get the top end or some of the most coveted gear/skins.
---
Not sure how it will end up like Anthem since Blizzard is just re-releasing a game and drip feed content that’s already there while Anthem is a new game built from the ground up through sweatshop production cycle.
---
Whilst there is probably various lore reason to answer the OP’s question, this is probably literary oversight more than anything else.  “What happens after the bad guy has been defeated” is generally something the ANET writers have traditionally overlooked in the Guild Wars series.  For example we still don’t know what happened to the Margonites after Abaddon was defeated in Guild Wars Nightfall.  
---

---
The Dragon Minions are probably more confusing though because they introduced a plot line in Season 3 where the other Elder Dragons can inherit the powers of the dead Elder Dragons.  In all honesty, it’s going to be very hard for future writers to try and resolve this in a way that doesn’t involve Taimi or Aurene magically fixing things.  
---
From a literary perspective, I reckon they should have written the story so that the Dragon minions crumble to dust or something after the Elder Dragon is defeated.  This is so that you could avoid a “there must always be a Lich King” type storyline to control the minions after the after the Elder Dragon is defeated.  It would also make it easier for future writers to move onto new storylines set in past locations as they wouldn’t write additional dialogue to “explain away things”.
---
Yesterday I did some solo roaming for basicly the first time and damn do I hate the mount. Free melee engage for the enemy while I have to waste a dodge to avoid the damage, people +1ing me out of nowhere, kill someone at their camp and they came back before I can flip it.
---
I think the back piece is from fractals (not sure tho)    
---
The wvw chest piece is the one that gives the glowy tentacles.
---
Some people learn faster then others which can effect progress speeds in learning. In a good training group you can go through it pretty well but others it's a chore which really sucks if out of 8 trainees (you included) 5 get mechanics down well but 3 just can't make any progress that slows shit down for everyone.
---
There are whiney, trolly people on most servers, at the moment TC is up against a Tier 1 Stacked Server Borliss Pass, they will be gone next reset, and then Tier 3 can relax and have fun again.
---
Gw2efficiency.com ftw
---
Is it possible to see how many hours you’ve played the game?
---
&gt; I really want to play it, because I love it. But every time I log on, I feel lost and not sure what to do and it annoys me :( 
---
And asking a bunch of strangers on the internet will do nothing to change that. I have played other MMO's and on other Reddit's I see the same thing. And frankly it's just attention seeking nonsense. You are feeling jaded. The game has gone stale for you. It happens.
---
So take a step back. Why on earth would you want to *force* yourself to do something you no longer enjoy as relaxation/entertainment? Just take a breath and think about that for a minute. Because that is what you want to do. And it's stupid.
---
No one knows what you like or don't like to do. Not any more than you know what I might or might not enjoy. And it seems quite obvious to me that the things you enjoyed about the game aren't grabbing you anymore. So walk away for a while. Play something else. I played a game for years and got quite stale. One day I just didn't log in. 4 years later I downloaded it again on a whim and it was great. People take breaks from games, it's the nature of the beast.
---
But I will tell you this : if you think that a bunch of strangers on the internet hold the answers to what will make you happy then you have bigger problems than just being a bit stale over an enjoyable game.
---
You legend. I think this man deserves a Gamer of the Year award.
---
Gw2 imo is a casual game, it's a game you quit many times and come back to. It really sucks because Gw1 PvP was amazing but got completely butchered in Gw2. WvW had so much potential but bled lots of hardcore players to other games due to developer negligence. Raids had so much potential, but TOO FEW TOO SLOW to keep hardcore raiders interested. Now that I started dedicating time to other games, Gw2 is actually fun once in awhile to come back to. But I "barely" give Anet any gem money now, because the direction they are taking Gw2 is extremely disappointing.
---
Sure, but you asked for a unique effect necro has.  I said transfusion.  Then you said thief has better self healing.  What does self healing have to do with transfusion?
---
The vast majority of the playerbase has literally zero idea who these people are. Them staying or leaving changes nothing.
---
IIRC it's the closest person to him that still has their special action key on prior to it being locked 20%. So if you were the only one with it left on then that sounds correct.
---
The armour giving the tentacles is the [Mistforged Glorious Hero's Breastplate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistforged_Glorious_Hero%27s_Breastplate) while the backpiece is [The Ascension](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ascension). Both are from structured PvP.
---
Weapons don't work that way
---
Each weapon type has specific usage and fits some builds better than others. Staff for example on guardian is a healing support weapon, but on elementalist it's powerful AOE dps
---
That being said, greatsword might be fun for you to try
---
You’re the hero we needed.
---
Sorry for my lack of knowledge fam, I got GW2 about a year ago, didn’t touch it for a long time, came back and forgot everything. I also don’t usually pay too much attention to my weapon stats, if it’s got better damage than the previous weapon, I just take it, no questions.
---
And there's a reason Wildstar never became the success it was hyped up to be. Most people don't actually want the kind of grindfest that classic MMOs were, they want to relive the experience of playing that at the time new, fresh MMO for the first time and getting hooked. But that's just not possible.
---
Perfect, thank you. When does the special lock?
---
1. immediately upon hitting 20%
---
2. once the final pylon is destroyed
---
3. once Qadim returns to the center after destroying it
---
If it's either 2 or 3, then the correct course of action is to have pylons remove special when Qadim faces their pylon just prior to destroying it.
---
Quite honestly, Im more surprised so many big content creator names stuck around for so long, with the little support they get from arenanet... and the 180 turn they did with fully committing to living story since ls3. Says a lot about how well developed the foundation of the game is to keep so many dedicated gamers fulltime in the game for over 2 years after developement slowed to a crawl on anything but solo casual content.
---
Ever since PoF really, all the communities Im a part of have slowly drained away... first people log in once every few days only, then only when a big patch hits (balance for the wvw, pvp communities... ls for my pve guild) and now my guilds are mostly empty with a big roster of "last logged in X months ago". So, for teapot and deroir to leave now too... not surprising at all.
---
The problem is that GW2 is great to play but terrible to watch.
---
The only encounters where you take condi scourge at all, you cut bone minions for epidemic. Bone minions do more on golem but epi is the only reason to take scourge at all so
---
idk what level you are but you'll be wanting weapons and armour with berserker stats (major power, minor precision and ferocity). meta dps dragonhunters use greatsword and scepter/focus - you can do this on a core guardian too, and you could use a sword instead of scepter for openworld mobility and the block.
---
some naively think it will bring back the same feeling and happiness they got in 2004, others think it will just be stripped down WoW. i belong to the second camp, i can see where the first are coming from but it's going to be a losing battle, the internet and people have changed too much since then, back then it was a newish thing, people were happier and times were quite different, there was no outrage culture. it's not gonna work out.
---
Its not worth coming back for either pvp mode.
---
i will not buy GOLD in any game, never. i do buy gems for GEM store things though so i don't get why you label me as a leech. anyways, go you.
---
Is this 2015?
---
So you assume by being diverse they can't be the best? Fucking racist.
---
I think the system with gold being the main currency can work, but gw2's problem with that is that theres so few "efficient" ways to earn gold in gw2. Or to be more precise that theres such a HUGE difference in how much you can earn throughout the game. Problematic is also that the majority of your rewards is put into daily timegated rewards, this results in a "have to do tasks xyz daily" routine that gets very old very fast.
---
But I agree, the better model is to make rewards more time investive themselves instead of making everything a gold sink.
---
I tried, but still doesn't work. The game doesn't show up after clicking the START button haha. I have to remove it to play. Well then...
---
Looked like roughly a 40-50% increase in average framerate during those beetle races. Ryzen 3rd gen has been benching pretty well so far. I would upgrade to a 3600 myself, but only have a B350 mobo at the moment
---
Don't give up.
---
Just takes a bit of learning then you will be good to farm it.
---
Theres always a handful of very dedicated content creators in each game that dont do it for the money, but because they are dedicated to "their" game.
---
Seeing one leave is hard on every community. We are currently seeing a lot leave, some due to personal reasons unrelated to the game, some like teapot and deroir because the game is developed in a direction unacceptable to them. Newer games usually have no trouble compensating with new content creators stepping "into the light", but gw2 is an old game.... so thats even more worrying... hence why some react rather alarmed towards yet another content creator leaving.
---
Better that than intentionally sabotaging their own partner relations, like the whole drama with JP.
---
Na transfusion is comparable to Druid, Guardian etc. healing in downedstate and also less effective in better teams wich don't go down - I mistook it for its selfhealing wich is also done better by other classes.
---
Kinda funny tho if you think about the viability of the class overall. Its working great as second healer but even there lacks the ability and boons.
---
Preach
---
Who gives a shit and hopefully not.
---
And only a few more until you get that final ring and amulet
---
There are so many reports that it is insanely unlikely that a person can actually review it. You can always appeal it if you get banned. The simple solution is just to tell them your not a bot and you don’t want to talk to them.
---
As a PvE player, I didn't even think about the changes this way.  I was really liking all of them too.  What sucks is it would be pretty difficult for them to split it between PvE and WvW.  The only other fix I can think of is if all shatters had, or could be traited for, distortion on activation.  That would make it more accessible as well, but sounds pretty OP unless the distortion was such a small enough amount that it wasn't noticeable to begin with.
---
Well dang, I missed what the name actually was, but if it's a joke about pedophilia then no wonder they got banned. Sometimes I just don't understand how people can publicly joke about things that are not only unfunny, but also actually very serious matters, and then go pikachu face at the inevitable consequences.
---
Fair enough. I just don't like the idea of being forced to communicate with them by accusation. Do we have rights in GW :D?
---
hmm, i have spent well over 600 bucks here over the years for the vanilla client, both expansions, and gem purchases for gem store things. i know it aint much but it's more money spent than 99% of the other games i play. so yes, i am totally a leech for sure. you win.
---
How could I have been so dumb? The power of my love for my cats will save Tyria!
---
No. Being diverse is absolutely fine. The problem is when you hire people to meet a diversity quota. You should hire people based on their skillset and work ethic, not the color of their skin and their political views...
---
&gt; I don't get why you need to make a thread about it.
---
Argument from authority fallacy.
---
Griffon is nothing compared to skyscale lol
---
How do you have this much time, a legendary takes like a couple of months each
---
He'll be back, no one quits an MMO forever with that much time and energy invested.
---
Cough reskinned hammer cuz anet can't tell the difference between between axe, halberd, pike, staff, hammer, spear
---
You can't have me
---
No you dont. Barrier is nice, but its not a block. As someone who mostly plays a class with no invuls, Id gladly trade my barrier for invul. Opens up many more options in PvE.
---
I was looking at transferring servers to one that's more WvW centric, as I was looking at Kaineng on WvW stats it seems that they're linked to black gate... How does that work?
---
Im basing off that fact that you are choosing to ignore what your teammates say. They want something and you are denying them that without giving any reason. You can say you care all you want but from my interpretation of your actions, you don’t care.
---
Also a disclaimer: I currently 'play' gw2, in that I still log in on at least a weekly basis. I don't currently play ff14 because even though I like it, I find that most times I want to log on I have to either not bother or buy game time. It's like (that other sub game) in that there is just too much else to do these days to justify the sub, eve online addicts notwithstanding.
---
in gw2 pretty much everything is damage and survival oriented. a real shame that they did this to their classes like mesmer.
---
it's hard to quantify the content because ff14 would be more amenable to speedrunning. 
---
"playerbase and how long the game is likely to last?" There's a small edge for ff14 because SE just isn't as aggresive as NCSoft. Right now we know that we won't get an expansion anytime soon (1.5 years at current pace), and the last one was out 2 years ago. So the game looks gloomy content-wise, which is what brings new blood in. For about a year  the content has been the LW story, which has low playablility (not really tested or designed much, extremely low bar for skill) and the gold-sink quests that it unlocks along with new zones. I like the latest zone but the way that they designed it to push people into getting the new mount is kind of low.
---
 There are raids but I think they're too easy to carry, but I haven't played a ton of the new wings especially so I'll leave it at that.
---
The early game of gw2 is completing the open world content of maps. The spread of the story content is pretty thin and the normal place of regular quests in leveling has 'renown hearts' as a substitute. This always felt really weak to me, as traditional quests at least let you be opportunistic about which parts of the world you'd explore first.
---
In short, if you like playing to complete the world content zone by zone more than you care about story content or quests, gw2 is for you, if that sounds worse than traditional questing to level up then it will suck.
---
the rest of what I thought to write is less comparison and just a warning about the game, so I think this is biased relative to the rest of this subreddit as I'm not a really loyal fan at this point.
---
The game in it's current state is pretty much all adventure oriented with everyone playing a lot on the new zones and then logging out for a few months. The new actiony combat that replaced gw1 giant skill pool didn't amount to much because hardly any of the combat in new PvE  content tests the players ability to use it correctly. HOT final boss is the last thing I remember that was designed around the new combat system and playing like a 3rd person action game (2015 release). They even gutted the base game's final boss fight around the time they went f2p in order to make it trivial to solo in exactly the same way the new episodes are (you get an invincible ally the res's you every time you 'go down', you have to go down half a dozen times to wipe, and if you wipe you don't lose progress) the original fight was really rewarding to play as the end of a kind of tedious story even though it was more or less required to find a pug. They also threw out the 'this is an rpg' system, which is why the base campaign is called 'your personal story' and the rest is seasons/episodes or expansions. It was a big fail in the first place since every variation in your personal story was still lineally dependent and most people didn't pay attention to the questions asked in order to cover all the instances even after having made several characters.
---
Around the first expansion they abandoned the instanced PVE content that was already in the game (dungeons) which are still accessible but riddled with bugs and only offering obsolete equipment. You can also get the skins from doing pvp.
---
sPvP (typical pvp) is stagnant, it's fun for a bit and give good rewards but has too many balance issues to be attractive as a main activity for most players.
---
WvW has less overall incentives than any other game mode. The balance of incentives is skewed towards capturing objectives. It's much better to move to something to capture even if there's another deathball of 50 players from the other server behind you taking back what you just captured. It's not very convincing or immersive gameplay for RvR.
---
Fractals became the main instanced PVE content, and some do like to grind these mainly for gold income but mostly people that play fractals are just doing dailies. You start on low difficulty levels that are trivial which you grind for the special stat to survive in the higher levels which sometimes suck to do with pugs. Each one is very short, so that you can do the daily quests in an hour or so.
---
The lore and writing is pretty divisive and is a huge shift from the GW trilogy but since you seem to have a low emphasis on choosing between the two stories I won't get into that much. They basically moved from the story having a lot to do with the theme and title of the franchise, to more derivative stuff from similar era games, and now in the gw2 era our lore is derivative of a huge swath of popculture (mostly adult cartoons/sitcoms/dramas) and it's hard to see the 'guild' in 'guild wars 2'. A lot of people despise the new characters especially since LW2 where they are the sole focus of attention.
---
Also a disclaimer: I currently 'play' gw2, in that I still log in on at least a weekly basis. I don't currently play ff14 because even though I like it, I find that most times I want to log on I have to either not bother or buy game time. It's like (that other sub game) in that there is just too much else to do these days to justify the sub, eve online addicts nowithstanding.
---
The best thing I did was take a year+ from the game and come back. The amount of new content was great, I felt like I had so many things I wanted to work on, new maps to explore, mounts to get, etc. I'm still riding that feeling for now.
---
No.
---
When Qadim2 breaks the special action key at 20%, he locks it to the "on" position regardless of what it was set to before it was locked.
---
However, you can still control the aggro. This is because Qadim's primary fixation target throughout the *entire fight* behaves the same way as Pylon tethering. That is to say that the closest person to him when the phase initiates gets fixation and retains fixation until they either turn off their Flux Disruptor or step outside his aggro range. Sub-20%, since you cannot turn off the Flux Disruptor, the only way to break aggro is to step outside his aggro range. (The aggro range is roughly the size of the circle painted on the ground around the boss.)
---
What this means is you want your tank to aggressively position on top of Qadim entering the 20% phase and stay close to the boss the entire time. They will be able to hold aggro as long as they don't move too far away. If you're seeing a pull where the tank holds aggro sub-20% it's because they're tanking well, not because the squad did some gimmick with their special action keys.
---
Obviously, as with the rest of the fight, the fixation diamond only applies for some of the boss's attacks. Other attacks such as the AoE lightning strikes and the three electric shot things that you jump over pick random people in the squad.
---
Seeing how persistent unofficial servers were there is definitely a market for classic to exist.  Maybe not in the scale of what it was but still. Even people who've said they most likely wouldn't like classic have found themselves enjoying it just like mama Blizzard used to make 'em.
---
Gradually they butchered what people fell in love with, but managed to shift their audience's focus somewhere else. It's not a bad thing necessarily but throwing one aspect of their game in favor of another is wasteful. Sometimes necessary, but still wasteful, and it attracts different sorts of people.
---
Kinda similar to how early exploration was thrown out the window with mounts and lv80 boosters and tomes. I'm not saying I'd enjoy that the 15th time but... I don't really look at places and remember what I did there way back, I just zoom past with a griffon or a beetle. And new players are coming to the game, just mounts in their mind, and they are pushed to expansions straight away, as if the devs are doubting their original design. I mean I probably would too after NPE but I don't see that as a long-term solution.
---
I prefer 1 elite player off the game than 1'000 casual players abandoning because you can't enter raid without killproof. He is a great streamer anyway
---
Oh boy, have I got [a surprise for you](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hungry_cat_scavenger_hunt).
---
Is the X not just beneficial for the optional overclock at some point?
---
Legendaries aren’t too hard, problem is you need to focus on activities that give you items for legendaries (doing HoT metas over and over, anything you can for clovers, hitting up malchors leap for wood/mithril (g2), dungeons if you want g1 legendaries, etc.).  So either you pay a ton of gold, play a lot, or focus your limited time on legendary materials.   Also, mystic coins are time gated (and mystic clover to an extent) unless as you pay for them, so if you are strapped for gold you need to wait it out.
---
If you just login daily and focus on getting some materials every day it would take about 1 year to complete a legendary (without spending a ton of gold).  If you have gold to spend you can reduce this to as short as you want for g1 legendaries (purchasable), and down to as fast as you can collect account bound materials for g2 legendaries (significant playtime but can be done in a couple of weeks).
---
people these days get offended so easily
---
New to GW2, so it makes me sad to read that such apparently dedicated community members have possibly burned out on the game. Although they have obviously been playing a lot longer than I. A thought I had to perhaps increase the popularity of the game is to create content in such a way that it would attract people to even just watch it in this age of Twitch. I believe this could possibly lead to more excitement in a potential player base to try the game, and make previous players come back. Srry if that idea had already been said. Also, not to be a begger, but if anyone is burned out and wants to help me get a head start, I am accepting gold donations! xD Cheers mates!
---
Especially these days
---
max level still 80, ascended/legendary still best in slot. that's what makes gw2 awesome. 
---
playerbase is strong
---
There isn't necessarily a "best" weapon but if you are core guard you might like to try out sword + focus with greatsword as secondary. (swap the sword out for scepter if you doing fractals/raids or other group content). If you enjoy the game I would suggest to buy both expansions since you get access to elite specializations; guardian gets dragonhunter and firebrand. The former I find really nice quick dps to kill mobs, fractals you name it. It's basically AoE cleave all mobs or boss with decent sustain. Hope that helps.
---
( ͡⚆ ͜ʖ ͡⚆)
---
Depends on the situation really.
---
AEGIS is nice against stuff that should straight up kill you but given how much cannot be blocked or just comes in rapid attacks it isn't all that great since it can be triggered by tiny stuff.
---
Barrier however if done properly tends to be useful allot more often as it eats up lots of stuff &amp; if applied rapidly completely negates allot of conditions.
---
No. I've been playing lol since s3, and I'm not sick of it. Can't stop won't stop.
---
Inb4 it's another gear treadmill
---
No, it doesn't.
---
I'm 100% confident that this is how holding aggro works since I can do it consistently. Probably ~90% on the rest. It's possible that there's some other confounding factor regarding the state of the Flux Disruptors, but I've seen him fixate on people who have had their disruptors turned off the whole fight once he goes below 20%. Either way, grabbing the initial aggro when the phase starts and holding it is consistent.
---
Are all the sc people loaded with legendaries? How do you guys get so rich? I remember there was another sc person who did a post like this when the last raid came out.
---
Off topic but if you are new and you meet an awesome player they can take you through the first pof quest and get you your mount without blowing a booster. And it was fun!
---
Bifrost so nice you made it twice
---
i think the independent servers were much smaller and the communities tended to be actual communities, not just amalgamations of people who happen to play the same game (modern mmos). some private servers are almost like looking into a bubble of a time that has long since gone, i experienced a glimpse of that when i first played LOTRO. classic wow is going to be a streamlined experience, completely the opposite of what wow actually was, it's more comparable to a museum exhibit of the dinosaurs, you get to see and read all about what it was like and even experience it a little but without the threat of being eaten etc
---
&gt;The newly released classic RO was pretty much a race to the top by hardcore players, done as efficiently as possible so they can dominate others ASAP
---
sounds exactly like asmongold and his classic guild, they are all just tryna go for world first shit and all that crap.
---
I actually mind that alot. Its annoying that there is not a single piece of nice looking gear in the last two Raidwings. All looks like it got Designed a couple of years ago. BLC skins are just ten times more shiny and detailed. Just go and compare the Wing 7 [weapon skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sabir%27s_Scepter_of_the_Defender) with any recent BLC skins.
---
The only reason Fractals are still something that get played regularly is the decent amount of gold you can earn without running aimlessly behind a commander for two hours. Other than that its just another neglected child with lots of problems and no content update for a year. Even for a longer time if you waited for another cm. 
---
When 100cm was released I couldnt wait for the next fractal to be released. 99 and 100 cm are to this point the by far best 5 man content in the game, if not the best group content overall. A year later we got basically a couple of story dungeons in fractals, which feature unskippable chit chat I wasnt interested hearing the second time and mechanics that are not hard, but just take forever to be dealt with.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Its annoying. The only thing Anet seems to focus on is one time story chapters and the gemstore, while leaving behind the real gems of their game and a lot of people seem to be okay with it.
---
You really don't need ascended armor unless you're doing end game fractals. Check [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) on your best gearing options but there are now a ton of stat selectable (or straight diviner) gear options from HoT and PoF. Also like others have said maybe hold off a little bit on gearing anything since the new patch goes live tomorrow, it shouldn't cause any major shakeups but it's always a good idea to just save your resources and check. It's also important to mention that the stat difference between ascended and exotic armor is very small [(~2%)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159ml1oahEyM6zWQ-oD4XQcHsk1mI5G6tVnjk_FOeinA/edit#gid=348011649).

Keep in mind that Anet is trying to balance servers around a bit population-wise, but meta changes when you hit T1&amp;2.
---
As someone on FA, we're toxic as fuck, and it's definitely pushed people away from our server over time (including me). But we are a "fight server" to our benefit and our detriment, so that brings others in.
---
Blackgate is the classic powerhouse/organized throwing server. I don't really know about the culutres of other servers as I don't swap around, but answer the first 2 questions and others can actually give you advice.
---
Also, stop calling your server whiners when it's literally just the guild you were running with at a certain time period. That's rude af.
---
Dayuuuuuuuum
---
The art direction has also taken a nosedive at release (and really since GW1) ArenaNet was the kind of dev that would slap your hand and say "No you can't have a fucking lightsaber!", where the few weapons / skins that had special effects to them were all the more special for it (remember Fiery Dragon Swords / Icy Dragon Swords in GW1?). 
---
But over time every time new set of Black Lion weapons have become a gaudy race to the bottom of shiny particle effects. And then the addition of auras that make entire characters glow in neon colours and mounts skins of course ended up going the same way in a right hurry. To the point that everything just looks an eyesore now.
---
This basically illustrates the problem better than I can; https://www.deviantart.com/nebezial/art/we-went-too-far-699669655

There are several [training discords](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) on both NA and EU. Training runs are run by one commander and they will usually ask for specific roles. Support druid provides boons (specifically 25x might on 10 targets), spirits, and other buffs that highly benefit the group. Tempest is a good secondary healer (and like you mentioned, most training groups want 2 healers) providing a lot of healing and condition cleanse. I can't speak for the group you were running with or the team comp you had but there may have been a reason they wanted one profession over another. That being said RA takes complaints seriously and if it was on RA and if it was a trainer they do have an anonymous complaint form to fill out. The server has also been restructured not too long ago with new leadership so even if you didn't have a great experience last time I'd suggest giving it another shot if you're still interested.
---
Ok, then what do you suggest we play?
---
flood of light. if history must unwritten let it be unwritten.
---
They won't always reply if they do get the person botting. Sometimes they note the account down on a ban list then wait for a ban wave. They do this to obscure how they "discovered" the people botting. I've reported a couple botters here and there (people teleporting under the map, etc.). The only one I've gotten a response on was a screenshot I sent via the explots@arena.net email of someone under the map at one node, then under the map at another node later.
---
But that's 1 response in at least a dozen reports.
---
rofl what AU are you from
---
If you're talking about the vivid lighting preset from this thread:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I'm actually the one that made that :)
---
I don't even use the fog setting any more due to the pop-ins so I'm happy to ditch GW2Hook.
---
Were you able to get reshade working with mount wheel + arcdps + d912pxy?
---
It’s an entirely different game now. Coming from someone who quit for 5 years.
---
https://i.imgur.com/EdeeRgE.png
---
Mostly PvP and WvW skins, a whole load of gemstore stuff that I'll eventually get from wardrobe unlocks, Birthday skins and the general festival skins(wrapped/haunted etc).
---
I really don't like doing pvp, so I doubt i'll get those any time soon. WvW I'm just stacking up tickets until I can get (almost) all of them. Still a while ago :|
---
You all had better buckle up for ERP 3, because I'm going out in a true blaze of glory!
---
All the fun is in season 4 maps
---
I can't wait for the balance pass to go live so these guys will find something different to whinge about.
---
You said it yourself. You are a long distance ganker and hate that you can't just stand back and kill with no risk anymore. I bet the people running past don't hate it , haha.
---
Anyone cares?
---
Shhh or the price will increase :(
---
Again, just like the guy above said , they think they want that , but they don't. It's nostalgia bullshit. No one wants to stand in town for an hour cause your party needs a healer , just to grind xp on normal mobs.
---
For anyone who might be new to PoF, and for anyone who is just genuinely interested in lore - I made a little video showcasing some of the Elite Specialization NPCs. &lt;3
---
Come, let me clutch thee.
---
&gt;Anet is monetarily incentivized to make gameplay unrewarding.
---
That makes no sense, because if the gameplay is unrewarding then it will drive away players, which means that the cash shop will generate less revenue. ANet is in this to maximize revenues, so they need to strike the proper balance of rewarding gameplay AND a cash shop (given their mission to not charge subs) that incentivizes real money purchases. How else can they do that other than provide shiny objects and convenience items, given their second mandate to not make GW2 PTW?  
---
We can probably agree that their current balance is somewhat off kilter, but the simple idea that the ANet cash shop provides solutions to problems they create, and that ANet is incentivized to make gameplay unrewarding makes no economic sense.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming\_changes\_and\_features](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features)  
---
They also mentioned that they want to introduce more "Expansion" type content to the next living world (like elite specs).  Which may or may not confirm no expansion in the future.
---
^^ this.
---
Thanks for the fix and its nice to see the topic being addressed and closed off w/ details.
---
As an aside, we don't know that all background projects were cancalled, though. We only know that some were. It's possible they all were. I don't personally believe Guild Wars 2 is the only product Anet is working on, but you know it's just a guess.
---
&gt; The GWG is a joke in terms design
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't PvE rules applied in the area GvGs happen?
---
Teapot streamed Guild Wars 2 and/or GW2 related content on twitch every single day for the last year and a half save for only 2 days. Can you explain where in there he had time to quit the game 6-8 times?
---
Do you use DX12 proxy?
---
Dulfy not making guides has nothing to do with the state of GW2. She  hasn't updated anything for any of the games she was covering since April due to her focusing on her career.
---
I have found one purpose for my other legendary trinkets. I have slotted in some +13 Agony infusions in my Ad Infinitum,Vision &amp; Aurora, so I only need +7AR/+5 stats in all my non legendary armor &amp; weapons... and because of their blinding visual effects I wont ever forget to equip  them 😅
---
Thousands out of millions. Haha , sure , what a high percentage !
---
Greatsword.
---
18th overall (well, against gw2eff users) and you even skip pvp skins - Impressive!
---
&gt;We can probably agree that their current balance is somewhat off kilter, but the simple idea that the ANet cash shop provides solutions to problems they create, and that ANet is incentivized to make gameplay unrewarding makes no economic sense.
---
I mean, there are plenty of games that abuse sunk cost fallacy and gambling to make truckloads of money. It's a proven business model. You don't have to make a rewarding game to rake in cash.
---
&gt;In the context of a story, yes, it's great, but I'm talking about meaninglessness in general. I'd love for my actions to mean far less than they do now, like no one cares, or you just helped some nobodies, but I don't want them to be meaningless, as in your typical "kill 10 boars" stuff that has no impact because they just respawn and you're only wasting your time.
---
I gechu now.
---
&gt;This isn't 100% sandbox, since there's a story and a fixed plot driving you here, but it's a good middle point.
---
It's not a bad idea by any stretch. I just have my own preferences. I can get by fine without traditional quests or stories beyond leveling.
---
&gt;But the fight is guaranteed, that's my point.
---
But why fight if it's shyte?
---
I'd rather have no fights than bad fights. A sandbox PvP game gives me the freedom to do something else if the PvP isn't good.
---
Yeah, it's not perfect. You might not always get a fight when you're looking for one. But it's really a case of what problems do you prefer. I prefer having the freedom of play that comes with the risk of not finding a fight, rather than the guarantee of having a fight with the risk that it will be shit.
---
&gt;Marvel movies are the cancer of this day and age.
---
I saw somebody make an album of pages from the Marvel comics explaining the backstory of Thanos.
---
In the comments, some random person said something to the effect of "wow. It's like modern mythology."
---
I wept.
---
&gt;Good game design relies in human factors more than numbers, and I'd go as far as to say numbers are useless without that human factor in place.
---
I agree 100%. I've just talked with enough devs that I've been able to get some insight into why some counterintuitive decisions get made. The human factor is like 80% of it. But the deeper context those numbers can provide can make or break some decisions. The player feedback is still really important. It just helps to understand stuff like player demographics and useage stats and other stuff.
---
please. i have the light set on my charr and the glowy wings are so small and unnoticible compared to other races
---
I see. its fully possible it wasnt RA. though i will say. i wont be coming back. I dont like how druid feels to play. not fun. Ill just waste space trying to be something thats more fun but not effective. Itll never work out.
---
Shows you how most players in the game know next to nothing about pvp lol.
---
Annie?
---
Well, I got all the basic glorious skins several years ago, just none of the upgraded ones or obsidian weapons etc
---
can you buy store mounts in classic, didnt think so
---
Oh man. If next guardian elite spec doesn't replace Aegis with barrier I will cry.
---
ahh i c, sorry since you kept writing giant paragraphs of text instead of just saying that I started skimming your text.  Now that we know you actually know what transfusion is.  I can move on to the other unique thing necro brings to the table: epidemic.  2 bosses have entire meta strats based around that skill.
---
Sorry, I'm sleep deprived and didn't see you weren't asking anything regarding graphics enhancement tools.
---
Gw2hook and Reshade are graphics processing addons to change the way GW2 looks. 
---
In any case, to answer your question, my specs seem similar to yours, and I got a noticeable bump in my FPS, particularly during fights with lots of people which is the only FPS that matters to me since I was already hitting 60 FPS idling in empty maps or doing 5-man instanced content.
---
[removed]
---
Lots of information. Gw3 is release this fall.
---
What if people like gear treadmills? GW2 or 1 don't offer it and retail WoW is ass.
---
You were? Oh wow, your preset is fantastic. Hope you're able to do an updated vivid lighting preset for Reshade 4. I lost over an hour's playtime trying to get as close to vivid lighting as possible on Reshade 4 but it's nothing compared to expertise of the preset's creator.
---
I don't use mount radial and arcdps, but as far as I can see from Megai2's notes, nothing in there states you can't get all these compatible add-ons to work together at the same time.
---
Ff14&gt; gW.
---
&gt; the other unique thing
---
read and comprehend
---
Outside of Mount Skins which I guess has a fair argument almost all of the BEST armor skins in this game are in game rewards... PoF and LS4s especially are great. There is a ton of armor and weapons as rewards. We also get infusions and etc, none of that is gem store.
---
I'm just a nobody, but I've been playing for six years, have over 15k hours logged, a pretty decked out account and an extremely extensive history in WvW. I've spent a lot of time commanding, guild building, roaming, small scale and teaching others who wanted it.  
---
I've enjoyed my time with GW2, but ultimately, I'd have stopped playing many, many hours ago had I had a life, or been at a better place in my life. GW2 was/is where I do my socializing due to things in the past that caused me to become extremely reclusive.  
---
Over the past few months, I've been making leaps and bounds of progress and am slowly moving away from the game. Although this is more about me than GW2, the state of the game does also effect my decision to play considerably less ( often times I'm not even on once a week ).  
---
I know many others that have left long ago and others that have left more recently. I don't personally think the game is dying or in a serious state of decline, but I do think a lot of veterans are leaving en masse for varying reasons, for most of them, it has to do with the "state of the game." As vague as that is it also manages to be pretty specific considering how many people will refer to the same issues.  
---
I don't know when/if I'll drop GW2 completely but for me, the social aspect was the only thing keeping me for as long as it has. Not that I don't still have fun, just that I've never been an avid gamer.  
---
It's unfortunate people like Teapot are leaving. I know Sindrener has also discussed his frustrations many times and due to having a kid on the way, will likely also be leaving.  
---
GW2 is a strong community and one of the best MMO's on the market. Despite how it might seem, I don't fear for it's future. I only hope for the best for those that are moving on. So too should you.
---
You don't get much more on the x models. Just higher clocks out the box. 
---
Just buy normal versions and overclock them. Save $50.
---
So is the balance patch coming out in about 12 more hours?
---
Then where is our Taimi Skimmer?
---
Did you know Mr. Gumdrops has a cutie mark sharped like candy corn? It's true, I've seen it.
---
Such invalid excuse for low viewer numbers. Yes, you are right that it is indeed boring to watch compared to playing, but so are many other games on twitch yet they have triple the amount of viewers just due to popularity through marketing. Many streams I literally fall asleep on cause it’s so boring, but I watch cause I get rewards out of it. Many others do the same and that boosts the viewer count easily. Free marketing through twitch and the fact that streamers gets support from the game itself is why gw2 will never get high viewer numbers.
---
I use that site a lot, yes. Does it show if it’s in individual inventories? I guess of course it does.
---
youre in a thread about someone quitting to play classic wow, where store mounts arent a thing.
---
just because other mmos do something just as bad doesnt make it a good thing
---
There are countless amounts of mounts in FF14 that you can earn ingame.
---
As I work toward on legendary after another, I can say it is pretty frustrating that despite which content I play it is really unrewarding. Kill, loot, sell or crush for materials. Nothing to keep. Loot is just to make money to buy what you want. And if you are one in a million you get an infusion or so. Got one precursor in 6 years. Never a good drop from any boss/event.
---
I haven't played fractals in a while but T4 was ok and I only did raids once because of limited time. So I can not say if raids are rewarding.
---
But PvP, WvW, OpenWorld is not.
---
Uh huh... and since than?
---
Anet need to rethink their strategy, if every cool stuff is being sold on gemstore(Mount skins, glider), there will be less players interested in the doing in game content to obtain great stuff. They did great with Xera's portal device, I wish more vanity items can be obtained by doing in game content.
---
According to [that_shaman's very reliable countdown](https://thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/) we indeed have a patch today so I would say that the balance patch is coming out today indeed. Would be a bit weird for them to give the upcoming notes 2+ weeks in advance I think.
---
this post needs more updates. Best one i've seen this week.
---
" Cool rewards that we can EARN! and not shitty rng/boxes. "
---
Have you gotten Elegy/Requiem armor? The inquest weapons from Sandswept Isles? Dragonsblood weapons? Astral/Stellar weapons?Mist Shard armor?
---
Took me a couple hundred runs to get full wurm armor
---
Thanks. This was cool to get more insight into the NPCs.
---
private servers show that people enjoy that version of the game. some people from retail will try it and not like it. that doesnt mean others wont enjoy it. private servers clearly show classic isnt just nostalgia. will it die 6 years from now? maybe, but 8 years of playing a good fkin game is more than gw2 ever offered
---
you do know the marionette is just the vinewrath fight only more monotone and confusing right? It wasn't that special. Just the first version of lane fights.
---
Scepter has really fast projectiles. Greatsword always felt too slow for me, but I don't have much experience on that.
---
Yeah that's probably a big one.
---
But for OP. Gw2 was always a casual game and because it's F2P they need to earn some kinda money.
---
I mean sure most if the mount skins are buyable but what about the unique raid skins? Chair Skins? Legendary Armor?
---
A lot of stuff is available for raiders. Anet made an excellent business decision selling mount skins to all ppl.
---
And I don't mind buying from them. Their game is great.
---
For mighty Teapots decision I cannot say a lot except that the emotional investments comes not through content but players and the world (well for me atleast). I am more into exploring than he is probably and I like doing achievements and Gw2 is a game catered for such ppl like I am.
---
Raiders are a small niche group in the community and I have seen more ppl joining the game than quitting in the last 15 months. So I do not have any concerns regarding that.
---
While this isn't a good sign for the game I guess. I'm kinda happy that he is going, I could never stand him and never liked the guy. Just my opinion.
---
I'm not sure I'm looking forward to an expansion anyways after PoF. I'm sure for some people similar to me PoF was little more than mounts and elite specs added to the game with extremely forgettable PvE content. They'd really have to reinvent themselves again like they did from vanilla -&gt; HoT and I really can't see them delivering something like that at this point.
---
update drivers perhaps
---
That means they fixed all of the runes too?
---
As someone who spent roughly the same amount of time on and off and just recently finished crafting my first legendary, holy shit, what are you made of?
---
Weird flex but..... jk, thats hard work. Nothing but respecc
---
Dunno about all that but i play gw2 casually and enjoy the game. Two things i dislike about it tho are:
---
1. Character and mount skins being exclusive to the shop, at least let me grind for them, i might play for a year to get that sphinx cat skin for the gryphon but i will under no circumstance pay 30 euros for it, suck some skritt anet.
---
2. The story had potential but it turned into generic stuff. I get they over extended with personal stories and the zhaitan fight was rushed but their biggest mistake is destinys edge 2.0, instead of focusing more on the pact throughout we get these boring fillers like a underaged super duper genius who's smarter than her whole race, a mouth breathing mommy issues emo that does exactly what for the story? A lesbian couple that...has...the power of scissoring? Plus don't get me started on all the build up towards the mary sue, Aurene. There are some cool character but they're barely used.
---
what?
---
Can you do one last gw2 teatime with Bik, Deroir, Brazil and Jessica Price?
---
"Here's fanart of some of my guildies."
---
Classic is more of an RPG whereas retail is a mobile game.
---
It's not just this site and it's not really recent.
---
it's been debated to death by now and people have different opinions but in my opinion WvW and PvP sets are no true legendaries since you can unlock the skin without making it legendary. Of course with this statement i don't want to take any merit to those people who go for it, since after all i'm in the same position as the OP but can't make the "WvW set" since i'm just rank 950.
---
No wait, that’s illegal
---
I still keep coming back, and playerbase is still quite active everywhere.
---
And when I play other games I get frustrated at what they don't do compared to gw2- specifically combat and ability to do whatever you want.
---
wvw still somehow interests me, and pve content is more interesting in the new zones and mounts.
---
Love the canvas texture. Is this the default Asura in the class cover art?
---
beliee me, wurm armor is much easier to get since you only need 3 drops, not 19 and their drop rate is most likely higher than a tequatl coffer.
---
&gt; Gw2 was always a casual game 
---
I think people are confusing *accessible* with casual. Just because there is no gear grind doesn't mean it has to be casual. Anet spent years marketing this game as an e-sport, and in the first year of development there was a big focus on adding repeatable instanced content that gets progressively harder.
---
Dungeons were meant to be hardcore content, especially explorable paths. That didn't quite hit the mark, so they did fractals. And when people wanted something even harder, Anet released raids. Don't forget solo stuff either like Liadrin that was considered pretty hard.
---
These are the places where GW2's combat truly shines. The combat itself was made for hardcore content, primarily e-sport. Anet changed the direction massively after HoT and it's understandable that people aren't happy, because a part of the community feels that Anet has abandoned them. 
---
They want to play the game, but Anet doesn't want them around anymore.
---
You're assuming GW2 was always meant to be a glorified facebook game / dating app, but that's not true.
---
really? I just needed around 50 or so around the time it was released. My magic find is capped if that matters. I'm sure you are aware that you only need 3 drops, not 9, since you unlock all 3 weights of each part with one box.
---
&gt; in particular I notice roamers leaving because it's just not rewarding.
---
I used to roam a lot just for fun, didn't care about the rewards and I'm sure many feel the same way.
---
For me the Warclaw killed it. Haven't touched WvW since. Anet knew mounts were a bad idea but they did it anyways for short-term profit. That is a pretty fucking big red flag. They've started burning down the game for profit already.
---
Oh god... my motivation for making all leggies is growing when seeing this. :P
---
Already have more leggies than i can equip at the same time on my main character, plus 3 leg weapons equipped on two of my more used alts.(uw ones included)
---
Reminds me.. i need to start raiding. &gt;-&lt;
---
I don't see why there should be a debate. The effort is legendary. The skins are not. These two things are not commensurate. It's that simple.
---
I started the WvW Legendary armor journey at Rank 300+, and not a second was spent raising the WvW rank to meet some criterion. I could finish the full set on Day 1 if I had the Skirmish Tickets. Now I'm 270 tickets away and Rank 900. Nope, your WvW rank is not an obstacle.
---
It was always really accessible: yes.
---
Does that bring more layed back MMO players into the game: yes
---
Are there ppl that want more HC content: yes
---
Is the HC community the majority: No
---
I think merely in demographic terms. 
---
Most ppl don't care about raids or T4 fractals not even talking about CMs. 
---
I can definitely understand the competitive community complaining and I can understand the HC PvE community complaining.
---
But the biggest part of the population is oPvE and casual content.
---
If a game is accessible it draws in more ppl. A broader demographic group means more diversification in activity. And HC end content is only one type of possible activities while oPvE brings you multiple forms of content.
---
Its not a hardcore game. The HC community is niche. I respect that but it's still a fact. 
---
Anet does not want them to not be arround anymore. This is only business. They use most of their resources for the biggest community which is the oPvE community. If one leaves because his favored game type is not as supported as others I can understand that. I would too if the only content would be PvP only related (because it's probably the game type I pretty much never play) but Anet would emphasize more in PvP if the majority would play it but it doesn't. 
---
Thats why they swayed away from e-sports. It was to little to late and didn't had any profit going out if it.  It's not that they want to lose players. It's that they can't afford to lose their majority of players and have to make calculated losses. 
---
What I would like to see is updating of old content: so old dungeons, old fractals (which they do update), revisiting old maps and reworking some unpolished or unfinished stuff. I would gladly have it. That surely would bring some life back into old regions and dungeons really need the care. Especially because many run dungeons for armor skins, runes and legy parts, so making them. More interesting would be nice. 
---
And lastly: stop trying laying words into the mouth lf others. It's a casual mmo due to its accesabbility. This does not make it any less serious as an MMO and I never said anything that should diminished its status nor did I compare it to any FB game.
---
It's an crpg after all, you must know how your hero behave. If you end up in tanking healing gear unknowingly, it will extend easiest fights to eternity.
---
If you join endgame content teams with wrong stats, you'll just end up being kicked.
---
You are an exception ofcource . Also what the fuck
---
Rpg
---
The shiny weapons and ultra shiny, The 3 Kristall weapons, thw swim bubble helmet, the commander backpack, the inquest backpack, vision, coalessenc, all raid skins... there is alot to do i can not belive that somebody rly running out of content.
---
I am a beta GW2 player here who lingered around for long enough to give a very biased opinion (yes, biased, you'll know straight away as you read on). As a bonus, I played FFXIV for half a year, and my subscription there is currently inactive.
---
My character's 7th birthday is coming up in-game, and I have dabbled in all 3 endgame modes: pvp, pve (including all raid contents), wvw (including running with organised guilds). I'll just give you this: **take my words, pack up your reddit bags, and run as fast as you can over to the ffxiv reddit.**
---
GW2 is a fantastic game, with a magical exploration. I would love to stay invested in it, but this is where the sadness begins. The more you're invested into it, the more you'll realise you're wasting valuable time in a dying game with very little endgame content. I care *very much* for gw2, but it is this love that makes me feel sad every night as I log in and stare at empty Looking For Group panel and the mindless gold-farm *'boss rush'* zergs (and for freak sake, ArenaNet promotes this boss rush as an 'event'. Is that supposed to be fun mate?)
---
Don’t worry too much about the LS episodes of you’re very new. They are a part of the story and come with a bunch of new maps, but they are optional. 
---
For now, you can make gold by doing your dailies and selling materials you don’t need. Doing that, at least some gold should amass before long. Depending on what your goals are (general exploration, huge meta events, instanced content with varying levels of difficulty, world vs world, pvp,...) you can increase that amount.
---
Short term gem-store sales.
---
Problem is on patches theres alway gonna be people who love it and who hate it.
---
But people are getting TIRED of Gw2 stalemate and predictable state and slow pace content, thats serious bussiness.
---
If next expansion is a bunch of domains and som pve meta maps without major content, the game will die out
---
I could churn out a legendary weapon at the rate of one per 2.5 to 3 months with a minimum of 1 Silverwastes Breach  + Vinewrath, 1 Teq, 1 Karka Queen, 1 Triple Trouble minimum per day in my previous job when I could play 3-5 hours a day including during office hours.
---
Slowed down a lot more due to my current job (1.5 to 2.5 hours per day) plus double clienting with my wife's account. My daily minimum now is just 1 Teq, 1 Leyline Anomaly, farming the living world nodes in home instance, 4 alts parked at Malchor's Leap for wood. If I have more time, just doing whatever catches my fancy or dailies for the two gold. Still can churn a Legendary weapon at one per 4.5 months.
---
Made Ascension in 1.5 seasons.  
---
WvW Legendary Armor set is the most punishing. Almost a two-year journey now, all thanks to the Skirmish Tickets. I have everything else years ago. Now I'm 250 tickets away from completion.
---
Aurora and Vision each took less than two weeks.
---
I know i have all 3 wurm armors and 11 teq skins
---
Why would I play that when I can play real single player games with better designed encounters and more a polished presentation.
---
&gt; sure,most players play open world,thats why its retarded to NERF classes in such radical way. why pve warrior got BERZ/BALANCE stance nerfed from 9 to 4 sec? :D its retarded. why pve chrono got 4 SEC OF DISTORT AND DISTORT TRAIT REMOVED ? its pure garbage,without any reason.
---
The reason is it doesn't matter for open world but causes problems in other parts of the game.
---
Why would they not change it, it doesn't affect open world.
---
&gt;ofc im gona shout and cry 
---
As you wish, Throwing a tantrum won't solve anything though and people will just overlook your post.
---
&gt;YOU REMOVING SKILLS FROM GAME INSTEAD OF BALANCING THEM. its not even argument lol. SO LETS MAKE ALL CLASSES AUTO ATK... much fun.
---
Stop being a drama queen, they are reeling back on the power creep they created.
---
&gt; Im gona say it again,since you are clearly casual asf.
---
More assumptions, I have over 12k hours with most on Mesmer but do keep making yourself look like an idiot.
---
Depending how soon you left after PoF launch but some things you probably haven't done yet would be:
---
3 new mounts (beetle, warclaw, skyscale and griffon if you didn't get it before you left)
---
3 new Raids (Hall of Chains, Mythwright Gambit and Key of Ahdashim)
---
About 6 new maps which all have some sort of a Meta event thing. Latest map even has a fairly good farm in it.
---
The "no friends" problem resolves it pretty easily by joining a PvE guild that does raid training. There you'll do new content with ppl who you can became friends with.
---
Sooo... why is he still playing it then?
---
I've pretty much quit. Gone from playing every day for 4 years to not logging in for the past month. I just don't want to sit here and wait 4-5 months for content I can finish in 1-2 sessions. There's only so many T4 fractal runs I can take. Only so many times I can kill the same raid bosses. Its fine. I got many good years out of the game, but I can't play the same thing forever. I'll log in for new LW chapters but that will probably be it.
---
I would need to have good footing if I were to drop energy sigils for frenzy.  I just like that extra dodge..
---
Well does it work? Yes. Does it play well and involve skill? No. Your basic scourge gameplay is running in circles on mid and spamming f1-f5. DH is just drop your traps on the node. VIM spike from GW1 (trap rangers in tight formation) was notorious for crushing rather balanced teams on voice comms without real effort with public groups.
---
Does it really affect top level in PvP? Not really. But to get there you need to go through low level PvP plagued by braindead Scourges and Scrappers atm. This is just bad for the health of gamemode. That is the reason why GW2 PvP basically dead at this point.
---
Guild Wars 2 already dumb down game from its basic state. Receiving yet another "scourge" with traps
---
Vision, while it does have a "journey" behind it, is more gated by gold than effort tbh.
---
Congrats 🎉🎉🎉
---
To update on this, I tried out v1.1 yesterday and it ran the entire evening without crashing!(even with alt tabbing away)
---
Is to farm gold or mats then not a effort?
---
Teapot.
---
I'm not really looking for an easy win I just don't want to be overrun by sheer numbers and not skill. 
---
I was looking at the homeworld list today and just about shit myself when I saw TC listed as full... I mean what in the actual fuck is happening there, not sure how they came up with that figure but it's very clearly bullshit. 
---
I really appreciate the insight, but for now I'll just rough it out and pray the WvW restructuring comes sooner rather than than later.
---
Dafuq... whoa 
---
... is it possible to learn this power?
---
Those 2 systems (everyone has access to endgame gear, level cap is static to not render older content useless) are actually 2 of the systems that were way made better than any other MMO. There are more, like "joy of movement" and so on. But the point is that those 2 that you've mentioned are improvements over what other MMOs do, and most people that play GW2 would leave in a blink of an eye if Anet would destroy what they made good. There are other games with those systems that you've mentioned which make players good due their gear and not their skill.
---
Oh poor summer child.
---
Let's put it this way. Season 4 you kill Kralkatorrik, and that did not really bring any hype to GW2.
---
LS = ongoing content for already committed players. Expansions = hype for everyone. Simple as that.
---
This is simply amazing. You should be proud
---
Games have come along way since GW2 came out. Open world games have evolved in terms of world exploration. Hell, if you can get over the graphics, WoW has a better wardrobe system and hell of a lot more cosmetics to collect.
---
Technically you can dodge it.  However, that is not the intended game mechanic, rather it is a limitation of the implementation method used in coding it.  Rather than a continuous rotating wall, it is a wall that appears at discrete angles along the circle.  In practice dodging it is mostly luck based, i.e. don't try to dodge it.  But, if your about to die to it anyways, at least roll those dice.
---
As Teapot said, GW2 is incredibly competent at making you feel alone while in a persistent, multiplayer world. And if I'd add that GW2 is practically the only game in town catering to the "Hardcore Casuals", players who can invest hardcore-levels of time, but not the patience for hardcore-levels of difficulty.
---
If this game is too hard for casuals, too easy for hardcore players, and too isolating for social butterflies, and it can still achieve this level of commercial success, logic follows that there must be a very considerable population of these Hardcore Casuals who can't be bothered to make small talk with other people (such as myself).
---
So, regarding GW2's identity problem that Teapot had mused on in his video, I'm unable to conclude if that is a result of ArenaNet being hopelessly clueless or insidiously genius.
---
I understand where Teapot is coming from, and I am mostly in the same spot.
---
At the moment I am in a wierd spot where I am bouncing aroud a lot of MMORPG's, and playing spvp in Gw2 maybe 1 night a week.
---
Right now I have Wow, BDO, GW2 installed, and ESO is currently downloading. I keep playing these games for a little bit, but mostly I would rather there was something I found fun, or challenging in GW2 to do. The living world doesn't really cut it for me, and in spvp the meta has been stagnant for a long time.
---
Tbf though, in those 5 years you didn‘t watch other players zooming by you on those flashy mounts ;D
---
Probably number of accounts purchased.
---
&gt; Also what the fuck
---
And with 36 accounts (it's about 10 hrs total per day)..
---
Let's not get ahead of ourselves and call it "strong".
---
So what you are saying is you would be happy if the gear you worked for finally in your possession, then an update hits and bam.. now there is better gear than what you have now.. and you gotta do that all over again.. you would be satisfied with it?
---
Content.
---
You couldn't be more wrong... See you in a month, when Classic has millions of subs and you're still weeping over maintenance mode GW2.
---
I didn't play wow in vanilla. But this is my thoughts exactly, like. Everything is already known, there will be a meta faster than it was back in the day. Thus the content won't even last as long as it did back then, and they pushed an expansion for a reason, people run out of things to do.
---
So if anything classics lifespan should be less than that of actual vanilla wow. I just don't see how that is a good idea. Unless they go the old school RuneScape route and eventually add things that the playerbase gets to vote on or something.
---
The skyscale isn't a free roaming flying mount—it has limits. If you move too far from your starting point (where you went airborne), you will start to descend. You can delay it by dodging/dashing, using Bond of Vigor, or using the wall latch mastery to regain "flight juice" but gravity and your mount's tiredness will always win.
---
Your max flight height is denoted by the blue bar (sometimes called flight juice) above your endurance bar when on the skyscale, btw. That will tell you how much higher or further you can fly without losing altitude or landing. If you have brown on the right side, that lets you know you went past your max amount one way or the other and will descend until it's no longer there.
---
And if you hover too close to the ground, it will descend and land automatically. The exception to this is if you do it over water.
---
i wanna see how thief portal affects WvW
---
&gt; If you move too far from your starting point (where you went airborne), you will start to descend
---
Got it
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Scrapper main, so I’m certainly excited. I’ll miss my sweet f5 skill, but I am veeery much looking forward to continuous shields. The damage delay is pretty unique as well, so I’ll give that a spin as well.
---
&gt; PoF was the best content GW2 has made so far. 
---
Thanks that was a good one lmao
---
Should end along with patch release (if there's any) which is usually around evening, ~18:00
---
that's supposed to happen, yes
---
that's great man, and yet there are mounts you can't earn in-game whereas that's not the case here, downvote me all you like, especially considering that other than flying, they don't add to the experience, my comment pertains to how whiny this sub is about every. single. thing.
---
Much like beauty... the value of worth of a person is always in the eye of the beholder.  
---
To a lot of people Teapot had worth. To others who wasn't interested.. found very little in his streams.
---
Why is this being down voted if he is speaking the truth. I know in short term game play gw2 wins but FF wins in long term gameplay. i have played gw2 for 5 years and its sadly true that the content for us veterans is really dry and recycled but for new players there is still a lot to discover.
---
&gt; Dessert Highlangs
---
How would world boss event make veterans have something to do if they could do those anyway?
---
I am looking for mirage to get the same nerf treatment as other elite specs.
---
He’s right, although I’ve played &lt; year of gw2 I managed to clear most wings and after a couple of months with my friends lost all interest because most of the cool content and items are behind paywalls.
---
GW2 looks rn as outdated as ever with the same marketing scheme to milk every coin you got just for the sake of acquiring content.
---
I’m still visiting this sub a lot and I’m kinda sad how stale this game came to be, although I’m not playing anymore this game will always have a spot in my heart.
---
For context, I alternate between both games and apart from Shadowbringers, I'm up to date on both games.
---
Levelling: GW2 wins here imo. The vanilla story on both games is a bit naff, but the gameplay shines from hour 1 on GW2, whereas in XIV you're going to be pressing the numbers 1,2 and 3 a whole bunch before you can do anything else.
---
Filler: Depends on how you jam. Both games have braindead content. You can zerg in open world meta events for gold gain in GW2, or grind fates for currencies in XIV. If you want to just turn your brain off, both games can cater to that. If you'd rather jump straight into instanced content, you can do that in either as well.
---
Story quality: Tough call. XIV is far more story oriented, and I'd say better at telling a sweeping narrative overall. It picks up in the first expansion and keeps getting better. I've heard nothing but good things about the latest expac's story. GW2 again starts off slow. It picks up in the Living World episodes post-core game. It's more focused on the stories of a smaller cast rather than a sweeping epic. XIV feels more like a long series of fantasy novels. GW2 feels more like an episodic fantasy TV show.
---
The rest: My break just ended, that's all I got.
---
We can only wait to feel out the changes.
---
Off the bat, veterans can tell it will be some pretty jarring changes in playstyle, but I personally wanna see just how much it will affect my gameplay.
---
Chrono's mechanic change is definitely gonna screw up alot of people's builds and playstyles and it will effectively put the spec out of commission for at least a couple of days.
---
Can't go wrong with Greatsword and Scepter + Focus for Guardian. Covers most situations in PvE.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

Relatable. I have played the game ever since the game launched and witnessed most of the game's ups and downs. All my friends have left the game, I see myself logging in just for the attendance check, read some random RPing at Divinity's Reach and home instance gathering, occasionally doing the dailies if it isn't troublesome. Eventually, I might just see myself uninstalling the game altogether because there is no motivation to keep going on.
---
GW2 content has been dry for a really long time I feel. Yes, there was a Living World story previously, but once you completed a LW story, that's about it (don't mention about going back to playing the story again for achievements because that is one of the most tiring and boring features of the Living World achievements). Seasonal festivals just kept getting reused over and over, quality that is nothing like Marionette and Scarlet's War.
---
Dungeons has been the same since launch and not a single dungeon was even added, only a few QoL changes. Anet could've added Dungeons inspired by LW story scenarios instead of going back to the story for achievements.. Most new content just gets added to Fractals, Raids, LW and the Gemstore. New Legendary crafting didn't feel meaningful at all (Exordium crafting was just a gold/material sink, nothing like how 1st Gen crafting used to be).
---
I can see why content creators are leaving the game as there is really nothing much to talk about the game anymore.
---
Nost of the times only the map currency is displayed, but not the keys from the map. 
---
In dragonfall its the exact opposite.
---
Do People not run RIBA anymore? i have not seen a single group in LFG, i play on EU servers and play pretty frequently.
---
It's kinda stupid that launch PoF didn't end with actual world changing events and simply left us off with a massive cliffhanger and telling us that we basically had to wait 1.5 years for the actual ending to the Elona arc.
---
Nonononono you were supposed to have both Eternity and the other two greatswords from the first set. Now you have to do it again.
---
I think it's not in the best spot, not in the worst.
---
The PvE content is what interests me. And unlike WoW, where's there's loads of bite sized content, from stuff like Archaeology to collecting cosmetics and so on, everything is a long term grind - and I get bored of it. There's not enough rewards. I want more cosmetics that are more easily acquired, or more little tasks to do that give me things I care about - character customization, mostly.
---
However, it's not like WoW is straight better.  I definitely prefer how customizable our characters are. I love all the QoL features in GW2 - I wish GW2 had mod support but whatever.
---
Besides WoW having loads of easily accomplished and rewarding busywork, I think a really important difference is that WoW feels much more enjoyable to idle in, and I have no idea why. It's just a really comfy game. GW2 doesn't set me at ease, and I think it might be the color pallette and the art style - Orgrimmar has a lot of warm colors, there's a soothing rhythym to things, the cartoony art style is soft on the eyes. I don't know. GW2 doesn't have environments that make me feel nearly so at ease. And it's not a nostalgia factor - I felt comfy in Org after playing for a week. I don't feel comfy in other games. I don't get it.
---
The performance issues I have with GW2 also don't do it any favors.
---
Dunno. I'm really tired of lootboxes. I want more skins in game. I wish they'd add a step to the outfit pipeline where the skins get broken up into gear pieces.
---
However, I may not be the target audience for MMO's. I never play reliably for more than a few months.
---
Yeah, he explicitly stated something to the effect of “It's a great game, but you shouldn't get into the game with the expectation of being a hardcore player.” He has repeatedly stated that the content just isn't there for hardcore players (which is of course what he is). So he's moving on. The game is great—just not for him.
---
I'm not sure which one to main, Necromancer or Engineer. I wanna play it in all the game modes. Which of these 2 classes do you guys find more enjoyable to play?
---
Damn, they're gonna be on sale? I just bought both of them like a week ago..
---
On the other hand, I love every single thing about this game and while I would have loved to save money, I'm not mad I paid the full price because the developers deserve it.
---
_waiting for someone to burst my bubble and tell me developers get only a small fraction anyway_
---
What if he grabbed the wrong weapon because he can't see without his blindfold?
---
&gt; some naively think it will bring back the same feeling and happiness they got in 2004, others think it will just be stripped down WoW. i belong to the second camp
---
I belong to the third camp. I never played classic aside from a few hours on private servers in recent years, I've started in late BC.
---
I'm still looking forward to it. Do you know why? Because of things I didn't appreciate then but I do now - progression and immpersion over instant satisfaction. I miss the feeling in games that when i get loot, it matters and i feel good when something good drops. 
---
In GW2 when I get loot I just salvage / sell it almost immediately so I can have gold to buy skins on the gemstore. It's not fun and not interesting. Combat is the other things: modern WoW and GW2 have sped up too much and no longer feel strategic. it's a spamfest. WoW PvP pre-Cataclysm is really, really good. I don't even care if there is no matchmaking and the rewards are shit. I don't care if there are beastmode specs that aren't balanced. It's fun. Modern MMO PvP isn't.
---
I probably won't stick around forever because I agree that it's often clunky and dated, plus I have no interest in the endgame PvE because it's about as interesting as GW2 open world.
---
I'll still probably play it more than GW2, even if I won't be hardcore.
---
You'll always see people running around open world and doing fractals but raids, wvw and pvp communities are mostly dead
---
Chrono hasn’t even been part of the fractal meta for quite some time tho?
---
took you a while
---
I honestly hated HoT as a mostly solo player. It's great if you have a team to play with at any time. Solo the game will roflstomp you into oblivion
---
Don’t play season 2 unless you want the mastery points. Look up a recap on YouTube. Play pof until you have the raptor ( first mount) then play hot.
---
Next speed flying mount incoming 😂
---
Living in your bubble and being dismissive of everything around you is exactly what Anet is doing and why this game is going downhill fast.
---
You can do challenging content without making it group content
---
As replies have mentioned, GW2 was never meant to be a purely casual or easy game. The community have just selfishly claimed it as such and hold Anet hostage to any decisions that aren't super casual.
---
Anet have tried multiple times to add interesting more engaging content, since and before lunch, and the community always backlashes and asks for it to be nerfed, as they feel entitled to have everything they want without engaging with the game.
---
I would not say that is shows how good the foundation is.
---
People that truely love a game don't just quit once they realize that there may not be so much more content comming for them - they keep on hoping that that might change and they keep playing until it truely gets boring for them.
---
Doing raids for a year without updates is within this realistic span.
---
Hell, in guildwars 1 we managed a sc-community for over 7 years now after the announcement of maintenancemode - with still way over 300 players left (so basically saying there are more hardcore "raiders" left in gw1 than in gw2)
---
What’s wrong with it? U don’t have to do it, some ppl might enjoy it I see nothing wrong with it, it’s like you want your cake then want to eat it
---
have played HoT? its a tangled mess that forces you to play with others. the only redeeming qualites was the glider that has been made obsolete by PoF
---
They. [English does have epicene singular pronoun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)
---
Thanks, I'll take both things on board though rest assured infusions aren't on my horizon at the moment.
---
I've definitely done a few runs of the golem with only half ascended gear. I really would like to learn to play elementalist to its fullest if possible since it's the class my "main" is and my longest running character (6th birthday in November), but at the same time if another class is more fun AND easier, I'd rather not sacrifice enjoyment for damage if I don't have to.
---
I'll check out some more vids as well, that's something I haven't done a lot yet as I preferred reading but seeing it in action would definitely help a tonne.
---
Haha maybe it's the other way around.
---
Going from mounted to "why can't I mount here" during core/HoT story missions made me wanna tear out my hair. Suddenly it felt like I was sauntering instead of running around.
---
picture of daniel chum on a facebook group ;)
---
Same like those "shiny" weapons and the ones from Miller. I mean... hey... it's some free skins for now. But I'm pretty sure half of them are just old rejects getting thrown into there (noticable from the poor textures and models) or literally just reskins with an effect slapped on top (shiny pistol, the ascalon sword). And yeah. The raids skins are quite bad. I don't know a single person who likes any of them besides the AC sword/shield.
---
Wait... he has cape.
---
I guess, because if you use all your major cooldowns in the first 5 seconds of a fight, any somewhat good roamer would just evade this DPS and then punnish you afterwards. The energy recovery food is just way too powerfull for most roaming builds to be exchanged by a mere 5s quickness buff.
---
wait!!! there are more mounts ? I thought Griffon is the last one. if it is not the last one then how many are there? I have until rollerBeetle(incl beetle)
---
Shook up the genre for like 2 months before it got more or less forgotten. It's climbing back to somewhat of a popularity, but wherever you are, people often don't know the game or thought it died a year after release.
---
LFG is there for you. This isn't a singleplayer game. I don't have friends who play gw, but I found groups on LFG with 40-50 ppl.
---
*AKA they don't do what I want them to do. :(*
---
Thanks for your kind reply. I hope one day he'll accept me too. I have to realize though that despite offering to answer any questions they may have, and subsequently years later, them still deciding to not take me up on the offer, I have to leave the ball in their court and come to their own conclusions.
---
Just recently my brother and his wife have been thinking about adopting a boy (and it looks like they're going to go ahead with it), and while I commend them for doing such a nice thing, especially considering the child was abused by their biological parents, in the back of my mind I couldn't help but think it was a bit bittersweet hearing that info, because I felt as though, if my brother can't even accept his own flesh and blood, but they're both willing to adopt/accept a perfect stranger, how is that child's life going to be? It's not going to grow up in a truly unconditionally loving family - and in that regard I feel like they're potentially doing that boy a disservice - because he needs a home that's truly going to love him, because what if that boy grows up and comes out as gay to them? Will they treat him the same way they treated me? I never said or expressed my feelings regarding that to them, but I keep telling myself that I mustn't judge, that what they're doing is a nice thing, and having 2 parents that love that boy is certainly better than being thrown around in foster care, or being abused. And who knows, perhaps that boy will change their hearts for the better?
---
In an ironic way, I truly believe that my brother's wife's brother is gay, but he hasn't come out of the closet (nor does his sister or family suspect anything), nor would I ever confront him about his sexuality or attempt to expose or pull him out of the closet (because that's his right - not mine), but sadly I think that even one day IF he does come out to them, then perhaps my brother and his wife will finally accept me because my brother's wife's brother is gay too - and from my perspective (and maybe it's selfish to think this? but...), it will be sad that it would have to take someone else's word/coming out as gay, for them to finally 'get it' so to speak. But that's life, and we all have to move on and just hope that everyone else one day understands that being gay isn't a choice. It's sad, but we can't expect others to change their opinion overnight. It's like my mum once told me that I try to change the world, and get frustrated when it doesn't work out, and that's been a hard, but true lesson, that, I can't expect people to change, and you can do all you can to help break the chains of ignorance, but at the end of the day you have to sometimes leave the ball in the other person's court and let them learn the lessons by themselves, in their own time.
---
Well, we definitely have different understanding of ‚nose diving to the earth‘ :) 
---
(I see you got your answer from another comment, so I don‘t need to elaborate on Skyscale mechanics.)
---
Yes don´t mess with him!
---
7 years in August.
---
It is always easier to point out mistakes in retrospect. We don't know what went on at ArenaNet and they did a lot of mistakes but also had a pretty big task in front of them by not creating yet another MMO that doesn't do anything different than many others before them.
---
the longer the game is running the more players will reach a point at which they run out of stuff to do so the "cry" for more things to do get louder.
---
However, a big thing I still see for the change are the layoffs. ArenaNet was busy with doing something else and neglected GW2, those events are a quick solution to show that the game is still active.
---
As someone who follows the MMORPG subreddit I see a lot of comments in regards of GW2 in which it either goes unnoticed or that people still view it as bad even though they played it on release or that they think the game is stagnating or dying because you don't hear anything about it while other game release expansions and so on.
---
From my time playing GW2 I had never seen that much content released for a game that kept me playing. WoWs expansions were always a rush to the next max level and then farming raids until you had your end gear so that you were prepared for the next expansion.
---
So, should those things have been implemented some time ago? Maybe, but now is a good time as any.
---
Dlgamer (Arenanet partner site) has PoF for 20 bucks if you can't wait.

---
In addition to this, for zones where "map currencies" don't go in the wallet, it would be nice if Mistborn Motes etc could be displayed next to your gold.
---
&gt; They said earlier that this is limitation ( gold + 1 currency of choice) of actual engine/gui,
---
Yeah, ehm, yaknow, *everything* is a "limitation of of actual engine/gui" until you throw coders at it to change it...
---
Wow, almost 3 years of total game time..... That's a lot
---
No. It states only once. I didn't looked it up in the first place and wanted to ensure the information is true.
---
I mis interpreted the community post about the 100% acquiring method.
---
Although it still would be awesome if this would been the case. A lot of ppl would spend time on that because they know that they eventually get another one and it's not all by chance. But whatever.
---
Didn't you already learned your lesson [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c8i801/ncsoft_1st_quarter_report_available_may_19_sales/esnor3n/)? I guess fools never learn.
---
Quest markers options? What do you mean by that?
---
And bulky like a Norn!
---
Can't wait for him to get bored after a bit.   
---
Certaintly GW2 isn't the best MMO out there for sure and it cathers to a quite casual-core community rather than the hardcore one, but he's willingly throwing himself on a dead game from the start...sure you will have some content for a bit...put maybe 1-2 years...maybe 3 with a lot of community work and dedication, but we're talking of a game that will never evolve. GW2 doesn't get enough hard content ? true. Well, WoWClassis will never get any content at all...  
---
At that point don't be a nostalfag and move to a game with a future like FFXIV
---
I know we joke about this, but in practice being a dedicated fashion warrior means having to do raids, fractals, PvP, and WvW to unlock skins.
---
Did I ever tell you the definition, of insanity?  
---
The definition of insanity, is, doing the exact same fucking thing over and over again, expecting shit to change. That. Is. Crazy.
---
At least make something more useful than badges of honor be shown in wvw
---
Yep, track that over time, and see if the number is going up or down, particularly when updates are happening and you'll see if the game is actually dead, or if you're just imagining things. Not too many MMORPGs have a sub more active than this one.  Four, if I'm not mistaken and not by much in one case. 
---
That would be WOW, FF XIV, ESO and Guild Wars 2 pretty much.  Other games have reddits that are generally less active.  Traffic changes due to expansions and content releases obviously which is why you need to track them over time. Since I do tend to keep an eye on those numbers, I can tell you that the game isn't dead. But thanks for posting something on the side bar.  It's not a dead game, period, end of story and anyone who thinks it is, simply isn't paying attention.

Blind spam rev. More dps. Lets go.

Honestly the amount of times i've heard "queues are fixed" over this games lifetime is unreal. It seems to be the ever-present thorn in the growth of the PvP playerbase.
---
I myself get into a cycle with this game. I pick it up on a patch, do the patch content and then head to pvp. I pvp until the queues start literally locking me out of playing the game for 24+ hrs at a time by displaying the map select screen on my monitor with no option of removing it.
---
After running into this for a few days in a row, i just quit. What happens when you're waiting for queues to come back up for the 2nd time that day? You play other games in the meanwhile. Then you just stop checking if the queues are back up.
---
I've went through this cycle every single patch in PoF, as well as 2 patches in HoT. 
---
In each of these i had someone tell me on reddit or twitter or the forums that the queues were fixed. 
---
Yeah, but for how long? A month? A week? A day? An hour? Too little too late - i already stopped playing a month ago because i had been running into this issue daily for over a month.
---
Is it neglect? Is it just a really hard thing to fix? Who knows. Personally i don't hear much talk about the raid instances going down. Never tried to enter fractals and been unable to. 
---
I can't help but feel its neglect when its been going on for, at this point, 3 years (probably longer, although i didn't pvp that along ago.)
---
Regardless, i will be back next patch and i would bet every item and gold on my account that i will run into queue instability within 5 games on my first week or two back.
---
and you even get work experience! gotta level them work levels...
---
Putting capslock on and slinging insults doesn't do anything to strengthen your point... Not that it had much strength to begin with.
---
As a thief main I'm finally excited for a balance patch lol
---
maybe it cause you to SEE IT MORE CLEARLY? since you are full of shit and you have literaly 0 idea what you talking about?
---
i hope that gw2 t-shirt outfit/tonic
---
&gt; maybe it cause you to SEE IT MORE CLEARLY?
---
Nop. Just won't read the equivelent of a tantrum, Will report &amp; move on.
---
Fun fact, you can set up 8k\~ bursts with dune cloak. Impractical over time but possible for every distort shatter 3 clones. 
---
Mirage boon steal will be fun though even if it's end of mirage cloak now, would've been op if they didn't change that. I'm curious how long the boons will last being stolen through this trait though.
---
You being a troll that jerks off to up- and downvotes might be a sad sight to behold, but it doesn't turn your toxic bullshit into anything of worth.
---
What's the original about?

---
Looking back at 2 threads I made around when PoF came it, it seems like a lot of people agreed it was great. It just isn't replayable so long term people have forgotten about the good things in it.
---
GW1 was more replayable than GW2 as titles were character-bound for the most part but GW2 is all account bound so you can only do achievements once.
---
Looking very forward to see reaper get fucked into the dirt again after becoming half semi viable with scholar runes.
---
As a fan of the class, I despite clones. Forcing me to use them is just.... ugh...
---
Necro. Engi hast to wonky mechanics for me. Necros are straightforward as fun to play in all scenarios pve and wvw
---
CoF P1 was still somewhat more engaging than the RIBA/chest SW farm is today, imo, even though both can get boring for me within minutes.
---
Required total cooperation? What the first week of chak gerent or just all the metas when we didnt know what we were doing?
---
The metas were fine if not too many, hot should've had like 1 map with more focus on just events but anet wouldnt be anet if they didnt go for extremes, thats what ruined pof for me, it did a 180 and moved away from mmo first event  design completely.
---
It's an 18% increase. I don't think that'll be enough to make hammer guard super OP or anything. 
---
The only place where I've seen hammer guard come close to DH was on Xera when there were tons of adds pulled into melee with good enough timing that hammer could take advantage of it.
---
Personally, I think the patch will be a slight buff for DH. There are some pros and cons, but overall it looks like it'll shake out towards the positive. 
---
The biggest thing is the scepter2 nerf, but all that might do is pave the way for something like sword to take its place, since it was already close behind. The loss of a ranged option might be too much though, even if the numbers are better.
---
You can bitch all you want, but those world boss trains are active from start to end of the event. This subreddit does not reflect the playerbase, neither do your anecdotes of friends and family. World Boss Rush not being for you does not mean that they're not a huge success.
---
Wanna see what Anet does to events that actually get received poorly? Check out WvW.
---
If anything, Anet repeating that event speaks volumes about its success.
---
didnt it occur to you that perhaps gold farming activities are "the fun part" for some ppl?
---
Shadow portal (shadow portal)
---
gem wars
---
Warframe Is pretty much as old as GW2 and it's on its prime.
---
People who usually complain about thieves don't know how they work and this won't be an exception
---
Drop Hardening Persistence for Shared Empowerment, it's open world, you don't need it.
---
Depends on the AoE, doesn't it? There are more than enough AoEs that consist of a bajillion tiny hits. Others behave more like environmental damage, bypassing everything and affecting nothing but your health.
---
Yeah we pretty much have no existent legendary effects. Also @op same problem for wvw chest piece. Have you seen how it looks on Norn compared to charr? I still wishfully think that one day they will do a massive update to correct the charr race but at this point I know it will never happen. Would love to have charr that aren't hunchback and every armor working ect.
---
What race is your character? She looks awesome.
---
Mounts will make hot enjoyable instead of FRIGGING HELL, especially for a new player. Unless you are a masochist OFC.
---
To see defensive boons, you can open the buff-table. shortkey is "b".
---
There you can choose outgoing and uptime. However, these values can be misleading, since they are combined. 50% uptime of double might stack gives the same value. Or solo-100% uptime = 5 people 20% uptime regarding outgoing buff. So, usually I only look at the uptime and compare groups.
---
There is also an arcdps-extension "boontable" that also includes superspeed, invisibility etc. 
---
https://martionlabs.com/arcdps-boon-table/
---
who cares
---
yeah that sums up rumpos life pretty well
---
We will see, I for one will give it a try without having played wow before for more than a few hours (graphics, just not to my liking really). As a mmo veteran of now close to 20 years, Im pretty sure I exactly know what Im getting into.
---
core necro hype! ^no
---
Unless your class has sustain, hero points from HoTs are almot impossible to complete.
---
I can confirm this :D I usually always roam in WvW, only come out to play new living world episodes for the story or some reward you get from it.
---
Agree.
---
Why do you compare 2600 to 3600X instead of 3600 without X. X means it is a bit OC out of the box.
---
Isn't zojja in like... A coma?
---
Why would she get better? She may be brain dead and never coming back for all we know!
---
 This work was created by me for my dear guildie, Altriea \[CUTE\], may your skies be clear and tender!
---
A human engi! Tried to make her look like a young norn hehe. The face is one of the pof ones
---
Ugh yes I'm really curious. Scrapper main here as well. If you find anything of note when making a build, let me know!
---
oh, yeah my bad, sry.
---
yup, fucking hated farming skill points in HoT. waiting till there are enough people at some of the bosses or if the meta was at the right point. it all feels like a chore
---
The day we can turn single use tonics into permanent tonics ... oh wait those aren't that expensive either.
---
Isn't the technical term "Less QQ more PewPew"?
---
Games should not need streamers to have a successful community. Gw1 and vanilla wow had no streaming and were successful
---
Well, you dont really want to portal outside of tower. Portal is usually used in one direction anyway.
---
How hard is weaver to learn compared to other clases such as chrono(pre-patch)?
---
i have done all of them solo by every class from ele to revenant. Sometimes it force you to change build to add come CC for defiance bar (vampire HP in VB) or more mobility (balthazar HP in AB) but it's not even close to group content.
---
Remember that they just started with the PvE events like 2 months ago. I see the current ones as a foundation to expand on, as they are "easy" like you said. I am almost certain that it will expand further than WBs and Meta Events when regarding PvE. I'd see a Raid Rush week as a perfect opportunity to motivate people to give raids a try. Same with Fractals. When it comes down to Dungeons I am not certain, because Dungeons have old coding and could be messed up rly easy when touched.
---
Classic will be rolled into the normal sub, and they'll keep numbers secret until they  shut it down for being pointless. Unless they let it limp for years, rather than admit it has like 1% of the base. I could see that.
---
I did a run like, yesterday? There's tons of people doing chest runs and RIBAs, maybe you were just unlucky? (Blacktide,EU)
---
...with a 120s cd. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Any idea if  Infinite Watchknight Mk II Tonic (the second one, not the first one) is obtainable anywhere? I really want it..
---
Unaffected by DR. Use them in multiples of 20. I used 260 this week in Fireheart and have gotten exactly as expected.
---
why? In group u can do HP faster but it doesn't mean that is the only way
---
You have been playing MMOs for 20 years ? Then I can describe WOW classic in 1 sentence. "It's an EQ rip-off with WOW lore".
---
You actually have to unlock skins now? Back when I played they tried to release a unique PvP set for ranked and people threw such a fit that they made it purchasable on the gem store.
---
I admire your dedication. I barely ever reskin whatever is on my character's feet, as long as it covers their shins enough to match up with the body and leg armor.
---
You think I learned the Deimos fight, leveled a revenant, and joined a raiding guild for the fun of it? I needed a back piece for my firebrand!

According to recent Glassdoor reviews, Anet's upper management hates to take responsibility for their mistakes, and that NCSOFT made a massive mistake to not fire any of said management who decided on leaving GW2 running on a skeleton crew in the first place. In addition, these massive egos on top keep preventing them from ensuring that the teams are in check and leave the company in a high churn rate with multiple cancelled side projects.
---
Where are you getting that information? I don’t think they ever said that. At least not about specs.
---
This is beautiful, thanks for sharing!
---
That's really not true at all. The Marionette made you fight it in small groups of 5 (randomly), and each small boss was unique. All of them needed to be killed to progress. The three lanes are the only part of it that is similar to Vinewrath.
---
Now, I kinda think Vinewrath is better as an open world boss because Marionette basically required at least 50-80% of the people fighting it to be competent in order to have a chance at killing it (and even still, bad luck could mean you had a group of five clueless people who torpedo the whole endeavor). But, that's a separate issue really, and I bet with enough time and experience, we'd get consistent kills on Marionette too, just like we get consistent PUG kills on the giant Wurm open world event.
---
WTF is a "cutie mark"?
---
Power scourge has been the norm in wvw for a while - Condi scourge is really meh if the enemy has competent scrappers
---
Core necro buffs
---
That's actually very good :)
---
ye there is some trash even if you ask for 250kp,but mostly its flawless run.
---
I'm kind of moving on from GW2 myself.  I started playing FFXIV.  That game is freaking loaded with content and depth.
---
I still log in to do dailies but that's it.  I've gotten all of the legendaries that I wanted for the most part.  I would like to get the WvW chest piece but I'm no where close to rank 2000.... I'm like 200 and I've been playing since launch.  I'm just not a fan of the mode.
---
Another thing that annoys me is the fact there are items in the game that are just too freaking rare - chak egg sac, invisible slippers, etc.  By all means, keep them as super rare drops but we should be able to work towards these by playing the game (and I don't mean by grinding out 20k gold).  It would give the game so much more replay value.  Like if the chak gerent dropped a token once per day and you could buy the egg sac for a stack of tokens and it was account bound... what would be the harm?  Same goes for the slippers, confetti infusion, etc.
---
I'm going to be playing shadow arts minstrel thief in WvW and it will be janky and glorious
---
Nah
---
Good, know your place. Pleb.
---
That is a poor example since you can't see the aura under everything else, you can only see the overhead effect combat.

Aurene was an escort mission
---
Oh so it’s not worse at all. It just isn’t a good value. Kk thanks you scared me
---
Didn't they just have this event not long ago?  And didn't someone open like 10,000 boxes and not get a single thing worth a damn?  Why even bother?  Sorry for being negative but its kind of the truth.  The drop rates for all of these events are too damn low.  At least raise them enough so people think they actually have a chance of getting something useful for participating.  With the rates being what they are now it feels like you have a better chance of being struck by lightning then getting something good.
---
TBH doing LPs on World Bosses is one of the worst things they can choose because nothing thrilling happens.
---
So glad I didn't make 2 more...
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/81729/upcoming-balance-notes
---
Did you not read the patch notes? Soulbeast was one of the most OP classes and now they're going to have to actually think.
---
**Shadow portal** *shadow portal* ~~shadow portal~~ &gt;!shadow portal!&lt; &gt;Shadow portal
---
Thanks. It's only thing that's motivated me to play guardian!
---
... OR they tried it once and saw that their shitty idea for "bonus loot" was shit and so they're trying to iterate and see what the response is this time now that they've added real rewards. Obviously they're going to make more and varied events, but it also helps to make sure they have a good system in place first.
---
The problem is 2nd is still good, but the 3rd is pretty ass - it feels like a massive downgrade from 2nd. The worst part is that the links clip like crazy.
---
In all honesty, I'm out of PvE skins I like...
---
The Function Gryo change is almost as retarded as the Soul Eater change. 
---
Classic WoW can't come soon enough. I am so sick of Anet.
---
Players don't still realise this but, GW2 end content is fashion wars :D
---
It annoy me to see my charc respawn at 90% or killing kralk... It ruin the felling of accomplishment to be able to die 70000 time without big consequencies
---
I don't think gear grind and player population is proportionally linked. I even doubt your statement people (in the sense of the majority) like grinding.
---
But: to a certain degree it's tolerable and that's the point here. If you prevent any grinding, you have to deliver other tasks for players to spend their time on which is way harder than it sounds. If you put in too much grind on the other hand, you'll lose players because they're getting frustrated. Grinding is a filler content which is why most MMOs use it as it helps them keeping their players busy until they've got more real content for them.
---
And now she is literally a godlike creature. Nice.
---
Its an outfit.
---
I think they're hitting on a good system with these tiered rewards. Everyone wants to contribute so they get the tonic or the pact materials, etc. So even if you hate world bosses, you can just do a Teq and get the rewards. It's very much in the spirit of Guild Wars letting people get rewards for playing the content they like. I can imagine them doing different things for rewards in the future. Like a special weapon/armor skin. As they add more events, the different final rewards become more prestige because it takes a while for an event to come around again.
---
Arcdps already has keybind templates for a while now.
---
&gt;Instead of going through aforementioned randomness or repetitive tasks for weeks you just gather the gold in a way that suits you
---
That literally boils down to grinding boring stuff for gold. Making the skins in gem store rather than gold store changes nothing.
---
Not to mention, players generally dont want to convert their gold to gems since they effectively lose account value.
---
No capes
---
I know I'm really longing for the 'classic' experiences from older MMOs - mainly two things that are not rose tinted and that's a chance to fail which is not synonymouse with 'difficult although many conflate it to be. And the second is a living world where players are in it (not teleporting) and the random and serendipitous encounters that happen as a result.
---
Both of those things require 'boring' things to facilitate them though that modern games have cut out.
---
In Vanilla WoW questing isn't 'hard' but pull an extra Murloc and you die, you have to think about what you do. There is regen downtime, so RPG elements like buffs from another player, a potion, upgraded gear, etc... all have HUGE impact on how you play. In modern games you kind of just run into mobs, mash a few buttons and with a self heal you're ready for the next encounter. Your cat could jump on your keyboard and the outcome is the same as if you paid attention, ate food for a buff, used cooldowns, cc, rotations, etc... those things don't matter in typical gameplay.
---
She looks awesome!
---
I do raids and fractals and even I would unconditionally state that fashion is the endgame.
---
The problem with this approach is that it devalues any special feeling from a skin. 
---
You see someone walking around in Mist Stranger outfit and you don't think anything about what that person accomplished in-game to get that skin. They didn't beat a difficult encounter or complete some challenges or anything, you know that they just swiped a credit card or exchanged gold to gems and that was it.
---
Every Mist Stranger running around has the same boring adventure of buying it from a cash shop. 
---
The sad part is that anyone who actually wants an armor set or weapon to show off is going to get out-shined by things in the gem store.
---
Mist Stranger outfit just looks way better than the legendary armors, a lot of the glider skins are just way better than Ad Infinitum, etc.
---
So, what do I do as a player that wants challenging content and also some sort of trophy to showcase? Just farm gold and get the outfit and look like all the other people with it who have never even touched a raid or fractal? No one would ever know that "hey, that guy beat Dhuum CM" or whatever. 
---
There's stuff like the Dhuum chair, but that's tradeable so it also doesn't matter. There's the new chair for W7, but then it's a bit ruined by the fact that W7 is kinda easy.
---
It's nice that many cool skins are accessible to everyone for money/gold, but it sucks that the options for more "hardcore" players are mostly inferior and they also have way fewer options.
---
It kinda looks like dragon hunter can camp scepter and range some bosses for dps but since stacking is a thing idk if that’s actually gonna work out
---
And some of those changes are rejected by even newer MMOs because they weren't strictly better. Shaking up the MMO scene for the sake of it isn't a good thing.
---
GW2 ditched quests in favour of events and renown hearts. Other MMOs have managed to do something similar to events (in WoW it's world quests) but they all mostly keep quests because quests are superior to what GW2 went with.
---
GW2's content rewards are definitely mediocre and it's draining the life out of the game. Look at how many people populated S4 maps with the skyscale. You could see tumbleweeds before that, even shortly after the episode released.
---
&gt; Theres always a handful of very dedicated content creators in each game that dont do it for the money, but because they are dedicated to "their" game.
---
No-one covering GW2 was doing it for the money - the game just doesn't have the views for content creators to support them financially. They are far better off covering something like WoW.
---
Fair enough! It's my guildie's character best friend, should have mentioned it but then again I'm just terrible at titling!
---
There is a second bar that appears above your endurance bar when on the skyscale. that's your "flying juice" When the bar depletes you descend.
---
I can understand what he means. for all QoL features and some really good stuff, GWw lacks in some aspects that become apparent only when you look from the outside in.
---
Recently I've picked up FFXIV and I've found out that there are mount oo. They have only one type of mount - running one where GW2 has three types - running, jumping and flying (Jackla is a running mount with gimmicks), but boy there are so. many. skins. And most of them come from the game. People legit do dungeons to farm mount skins. 
---
And remember how GW2 endgame is fashion wars? FFXIV has in-game fashion contests. Where you register your looks and stuff. Happens weekly.
---
Now, I don't want to say that FFXIV is better in every way, but there are these features that I wish were in gw2 because there are not style choices or anything, they would be just pure upgrades for the game
---
That makes sense. Using the mystic forge is tedious though
---
Twas ever thus.
---
I would be too, if they weren't the same buffs weavers got thus completely overshadowing tempest still, until the inevitable nerf that hits tempests/core eles harder than weaver..
---
*sigh*
---
Chronos are getting a big nerf hammer today in about 80 minutes. Builds will be updated once people have some time to try out the changes.
---
There is balance patch incoming in 1,5 hours, stuff will change. Giving you build now is possibly quite meaningless.
---
But anyways, chrono is more utility than support in WvW. there is no time to stack in wells, the squad needs to be moving. Also chrono nowadays is more aimed towards prolonging existing boons, not spamming them itself. And because of WvW needs permanent reapplication of boons, as older ones get stripped or corrupted en masse, thus this support is not really best suited for it.
---
Gravity wells, cc, veils, portals...that's what chronos mostly do nowadays :)
---
Ahh, okay.  I don't think I have actually ever seen a GvG in EotM.  I have seen them in guild halls though and remember complaints about it.
---
[Me reading this:](https://pics.me.me/mmhm-oh-yeah-yeah-yeah-9236-i-know-some-of-25970433.png)
---
He is finally ready to let go of dead trash from dead company.
---
People flocking to a new WoW release, playing it for a few weeks then quitting is basically a meme at this point.
---
&gt; there will be a meta faster than it was back in the day
---
There already is in classic beta.  Every PvP streamer, and I mean EVERY one takes engineering for grenades.  Engineering is basically required for PvP, which sucks because a lot of classes require crafting for BiS pieces.
---
Put a couple of Aurillium infusion and suddenly Valhalla is real!
---
There is a good deal of HoT content that isn't doable solo outside of some really specialized builds
---
I seen the balance patch, I didn't think it was a huge need to a support chrono. Guess that's how nooby I am with mesmer
---
If Portal Entre can have a cooldown as low as 72 seconds, we can **realistically** expect Shadow Portal to be even lower when it's only one way.
---
This might or might not be short-ish, but you can check here for various PvP builds that are used in the current meta.  It lists their traits/amulets/etc., and also describes what each build should use as its rotation and attempt to accomplish in a game, which you can reverse-engineer to determine what you're looking for in assessing them as enemies.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest
---
Of course, not everyone plays a meta build, so you'll just need to be prepared to be surprised sometimes.
---
I mean power chronos have their reliable way of slowing enemies down now. So power chronos will definitely be stronger. Idk about boon chronos though. Losing distortion is going to hurt a lot.
---
I find these events counter productive because the more players that show up, the longer it'll take for the juvenile pets to respawn. I really hope ANet changes this in the future.
---
good, glad to see you are still playing
---
oh sorry i meant strictly PvE, no clue about PvP since I didn't touch this season.
---
excited for guardian changes ! and how core guard will wrk
---
wait a moment, all signets?
---
The primary changes that will affect Chronomancers is having Continuum Shift tied to Distortion (if you want the cooldown-resetting trickery of CS, you're giving up the ability to use Distortion on demand as a defensive tool, and vice versa) and losing the ability to shatter when you have no clones.  In Wuvwuv, the latter might be the more important change, it means you'll need to have a clone/phantasm alive to use any of your shatters, including CS, and it might be hard to keep them alive in zerg fights.
---
&gt;  new WoW release,
---
Except its not even new.
---
I don't quite get the negativity *right now* - There has been a constant stream of content since the last episode with weekly events and a new festival, new raid, new balance update etc. - I mean I can see the point of the criticism, but why exactly **now** ?
---
Unless the partners saw the next big patch and were underwhelmed I can't see why they bash on the game when Anet seems to have made improvements since the layoffs.
---
Keep in mind that there is a balance patch in literally one hour, so some of the stuff will be outdated very soon.
---
Copper fed salvage-o-matic for sure. After that I'd look at expanding material storage to 500, getting bag slots for your main character(s) and maybe more character slots/shared inventory slots. Of course, some of the cosmetic stuff is nice too. As previously stated, I'd wait until August where there is usually sales on some items you may have your eye on.
---
Congrats, but you aren't most people. The only reason GW2 is so populated is the lack of sub fee.
---
I mean, you don't have to do it if you don't want to. I got decent drops last time that helped me out, so I plan on doing a little bit again this go around. Also the free ls4 currencies aren't bad since I need some more.
---
Anyone else devo they didn't get the super buff sylvari with the leaf beard as an option?
---
How did you get the dx12 proxy stable? I installed it for the first time and my entire screen is flashing green and purple
---
Depends, what types of content are your main priorities? WvW, PvP, Open World, Fractal, Raids, etc. Hard to make suggestions without knowing what you want to do with these builds.
---
&gt; I was talking about ' gear grind ' not grind in general.
---
Which I understood, but gear grind is probably the most basic grind of them all, so everything I've said is also true for the former.
---
&gt; people seem to be okay with it
---
Yep, that's my point. People can be okay with grinding, but that doesn't mean they like the concept.
---
After 7 years in development, hopefully it'll have been worth the wait.
---
Yes
---
Then it all circles back to their lack of communication. They let player speculation spiral out of control trying to come up with our own explanations when all they'd have to do is be transparent. Say "We are going to be doing the same event with multiple iterations to see how the communtiy reacts, we already have x y and z other events planned. If you have suggestions for weekend events, let's hear it!" - that's all they'd have to do.
---
Instead they look like they have already ran out of ideas / resources for events and just keep rehashing the one event they've got as filler so players don't riot as much.
---
ls4 ep6 literally just came out only 2 months ago lol jesus christ. at least they are doing \*something\* in between content releases.
---
He's quitting GW2 as his main game, but said he will probably still play it casually when patches come out.
---
He still loves the game and says it is a fantastic game, but the current direction is not for him.
---
Some nice fights, that ending tho...
---
...but it's thief we're talking about, not mesmer; ANet has to fuck it up royally in some way. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt; If anything, Anet repeating that event speaks volumes about its success.
---
Or their lack of inspiration, resources, and content. One or the other.
---
Slacker
---
Long range, instant spike damage. Condis don't last long enough in the current meta assuming opponents are running proper support classes to condi cleanse with.   
---
The Celestial Scourge build is not TERRIBLE if you're playing off-hours, in disorganized groups, against disorganized group.
---
Necro balance patch QQ is a tradition regardless of whether or not they receive any actual nerfs.
---
As a WvW player, my only hope is ANet reduce all Skills damage min 30-40%, so zerg fights can be interesting again, not like right now, fights only last for 3-5 sec with 0 chance to counter.
---
See I missed that! Thanks for pointing that out. Glad to hear it. 
---
Still, variety would be nice, and unique rewards.
---
My dream scenario would be if Anet added unique drops that can only be obtained from these events. Now THAT would motivate people. 2 blues and a green? Not so much.
---
Awesome combination. I love it.
---
What about Scourge, Firebrand, Holosmith, Mirage, Spellbreaker...
---
Pretty cool xD. Only. Instead of Punk it should probably say Pug...
---
The problem isn't entirely the game, it's the community itself. A lot of people's memories of classic WoW are before things like Thottbot, QuestHelper, and the like. Before there were online scripts that could parse what your optimal DPS rotation should be, before DPS meters. The skill and knowledge of the playerbase at large has gone up enormously and so have the tools to optimize things. Private servers have the benefit of not having the players at large trying to optimize everything, but opening to the larger playerbase will bring it back. Heck many of the big streamers hoping to return to classic WoW are already planning to race for world firsts and you have people figuring out how to do everything optimally.
---
Just watch the very introduction of this video. They basically admit they are a group of children bashing the game.
---
Firebrand or Renegade for a t4 fractal healer? I have a dps-boon set for either class, that's taken care of but I am stuck on which to give the harrier healing set to. I know the meta comp sees the FB being the dps-boons and Renegade as the healer but I see more LFG posts asking for a FB healer. Does FB carry PUGs easier than a Renegade does? I mostly PUG these days so trying to figure out which would be more useful and not have a hard time herding the self destructive cats in a t4.
---
Oh ... this streamer ... yeah, I don't think there's a chance of him leaving. This post and this claim is just trollbait to go along with the other streamer that left when he complained of toxicity within the Guild Wars 2 community.
---
&gt; No shit World Boss Rush won't provide continued, challenging content for strongly involved veterans on endgame level. Duh.
---
I never expected them to be. All I want for these events is to bring forgotten parts of the game back, even if just for a week. Dungeons, jumping puzzles and things like that.
---
Currently these events are limited to a part of the game where content is still being done actively, yet isn't much fun. The rewards aren't great either.
---
I think events are a great idea, but I have problems with the direction they are going and how half-hearted this whole thing feels right now. And I'll be honest, I don't think they want to fix it: they want rewards to be bad, they want content to be unrewarding. They are too focused on squeezing profit out of whales while doing the bare minimum to keep the community going. But trust me, I hope they prove my cynical ass wrong.
---
These are the types of fashion/armour I enjoy seeing! One theme, a colour palette that's not over the top, and not too flashy. You've done a great job putting this toghether. 
---
To me it looks a little like a holy harpy, which is fitting, as harpies are said to be fallen angels/valkyries of Dwayna.
---
And for many, MANY people they will be. I can name at least 20 people in one of my guilds that are jumping into classic as they've never played WoW and they're all super excited.
---
Undyable Auras, with no pre-view. Heaps of armor clipping. Stretched armor on 3 of the 5 races. Everyone looks like the fucking sun or rainbow vomit.
---
"Fashion Wars".
---
I mean there's that Branch Goatee face 🤔
---
then go climb to the trees in bitterfrost, highest is like 50k units
---
Hmm. I guess that's  true for some players . And necros does attract that, cause when casual noobs ask what's easy, everyone says "necro". But, still ,it always amazes me when someone in my guild says they never read patch notes, and has no idea what people are talking about.
---
I preferred the alternative title of “the joys of finally riding your friend”. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
FB provides a lot of defensive support which is why you see it more often. Renegade mostly has just heals.
---
GW3 when?
---
Oh, weaver overloadd are triggering on-attune traits now too?
---
Awesome!
---
Yeah had people say that yesterday in my WvW discord... they didn't know scrapper F5 is going away,  nor that thief is losing traps and getting new utilities including a portal...
---
2021
---
Boon support chrono is dead for quite a while and today's patch might kill chrono completely in zerging.
---
I knew someone will make this joke xD
---
Are they bad?
---
They've taken the lowest common denominator and slapped a bit of extra loot on it. Good work deducing it's low effort. (Let's ignore the community goals and whatnot for a second, this is not the time for a realistic, nuanced evaluation of the situation, now is it.) But if you call all the releases, updates and events since War Eternal the 'bare minimum', you've long since left all rational expectations beyond you. Anet has gone way beyond everything the game has so far seen by sheer numbers alone of shit they throw at us to keep us entertained. There were times when they had three fixed server crashes between two Living World releases. Compared to that we're living in a golden age.
---
But hey, all Anet's doing is milking whales and doing the bare minimum to keep the community going, amiriteguise?! You're like one step away from going full ded gaem. Take a break, for God's sake, the game isn't going anyway. You can play it again if you start having fun again. Or if there's some fresh content to blast throug. Whatever floats your boat.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?
---
Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

---
&gt; a high churn rate with multiple cancelled side projects.
---
RIP Fortune's Vale.
---
Rip a hell of a lot of things.
---
Late patch note is one that was already in the preview. I have the wiki page for the preview up and Power Overwhelming had that change already announced on the preview.
---
Goodbye Dragon Bash, it has been fun to celebrate in Hoelbrak!
---
Hope they bring it back to GW1 roots.
---
The worst parts of the chrono update were all left intact.
---
Huh? He's not asking
---
Yeah, yeah, you totally enraged me and whatnot. If we can skip the delusions of grandeur and internet psychoanalysis for a second, let's get back to the objectively high effort filler content inbetween major content bombs, in both numbers as well as quality, that you described as the bare minimum while they're milking whales, shall we?
---
TL;DR Talk bullshit, get set straight.
---
You drink tea out of it. And if you throw it at a wall it doesn't break.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I don't see why not. Might get moved back a week or so maybe, but we'll find out soon in the next few weeks :)
---
Still hoping for a toggle on them someday, i want he 3 legendaries but I dont want a black goop ball floating above my crystal themed character :/
---
Yeah that was a rollercoaster for me too.
---
Nothing out of the ordinary. Just followed the instructions to installed.
---
Everyone's rig is different and it might be something small and hard to identify that's causing the problem for you.
---
Only way to know is to try every option and narrowing down the cause. Example would be:
---
1. Remove the bin64 folder and all add-on files in your GW2 folder except the .exe and .dat. Launch the game to recreate the bin64 folder and install the d912pxy again.
---
2. If still fails, locate your Common Files GW2 folder, delete it and launch and try again.
---
3. If that fails remove all GW2 files, reinstall GW2 and d912pxy
---
4. If that fails try reinstalling your GPU drivers.
---
5. If that fails, try updating your Windows and whatever device that needs a driver update.
---
6. If that fails, you might have to consider resetting your windows and do a clean reinstall.
---
7. If all the above don't work, then it might be a hardware issue. d912pxy is a DirectX translation tool that is meant to utilize your resources more fully to play GW2. It might be that your hardware doesn't have the resources to support such utilization.
---
Another possibility is to read Megai2's FAQ and see if the tool has any limitations. Those include:
---
- Your GPU must be DirectX12 capable.
---
- You will need Windows 10
---
- You are recommended to have at least 16gb of RAM
---
- Your Windows and GW2 should be the 64bit versions.
---
Arenanet, can you just delete my Chrono so I can stop being bullied?
---
Whenever I read "I play defensive in wvw" all I can think of are players siege hugging inside towers and keeps and never leaving unless easy bags. It makes me surprise anyone can have fun with that, whenever I had to siege it was boooooooring.
---
This is pretty lightweight even for a balance patch.  I guess depending on what Shaman uncovers, there could be a patch as soon as next week?
---
I'm looking at the preview right now, and the late note is definitely NOT in there.
---
Love it
---
I'm curious if it works as the opposite as the other version..
---
I think you are in the wrong game subreddit because you just described the opposite of GW2 :D   
---
\- Devs are famous for listening, especially when it comes to QOL changes  
---
\- the game is one of the top played mmorpg games with frequent content updates. I'm playing for 6+ years and still have tons of stuff to do.  
---
Fun though is subjective for everyone. This game might not be for you, so it can be 'dead' in your eyes. But stating this as a basic generalized truth is wrong.
---
You are mentally Ill. Get help.
---
That... Was fast. Like it downloaded too fast.
---
Small update?
---
Not really, we just lost 10% damage modifier.
---
By the way, I think you'll like this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvJPKOLDSos
---
I think that's close to the middle point I'm talking about. The only downside is it's a single player game.
---
Then any of those 4 you listed have decent dps builds for both power-based damage and condition-based damage. If you really care about the absolute top tier raid builds, refer to www.snowcrows.com for build details.
---
Hey not, It could be buff. We will have to see the numbers.
---
Speak for yourself, I was looking forward to the "Ruler of the Skies" title.  I'd love having a reason to do more rifts, they're fun.
---
&gt;Focused Siphoning: Increased power scaling by 400% in PvE only. Increased healing scaling by 400% in PvE only.
---
Seems like it isn't actually 400%?
---
Wiki lists the life steal base at 97. So it should be around 500, Instead tooltip just does 152 damage. Which is about a 50% increase instead of 400%.
---
&gt; Shatter Skills: Mesmers who are using the chronomancer specialization now receive new shatters that replace the four core shatters. Chronomancer shatters require at least 1 clone to activate, and unlike core shatters they do not replicate the shatter effect on the mesmer.
---
# there are HoT owners that still has not bought PoF. This cannot stand. So Chrono must die in all engame modes.
---
Which is higher? 300 power or 10% modifier?
---
Not convinced it was hard. People were just bad because it was new and no-one had figured it out yet. Plus there weren't tons of guides for everything.
---
Blighters Boon exists... Do people not know it exists?
---
The client downloads compressed files.
---
Since skill mechanics actually happen server-side, this was mostly text strings and trait icons. Text files compress very well, and trait icons are small.
---
I mean it'll be super hyped and end in disappointment and mostly abandoned.
---
Oh wow this is great info, thank you very much for this post.  
---
NGL it's a little bit of a tough choice deciding between the two atm but i've just finished installing it now so i'm hopefully about to mess around a bit and hope it goes well.
---
Revealed Training in Deadly Arts got an undocumented update, it now gives 80 power baseline, and 120 more when revealed, instead of 200 when revealed.
---
Chrono changes are bullshit. Seriously.
---
With the effective loss of 1/4 possible shatter clones (with the mesmer counting as the 4th), and having to have at least one to shatter, and clones dying in a strong breeze to AoE, it's a BIG fucking nerf.
---
Yeah, I mean to me, they look cool, but they only fit with a very small subset of wardrobe skins...
---
I totally forgot I expanded this section like month ago and still no one uploaded any images for last one?
---
Nothing but Nerfs take less data. Who knew?
---
Most reasonable expectations, to be honest.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Focused_Siphoning
---
Is where I got the power scaling coefficient from and the patch notes reference that not the base damage of the skill.
---
It does note: "Damage above shows the raw base damage for a level 80 character, and the power-scaling coefficient. Weapon strength and target armor have no effect on damage."
---
I can't log in at the moment, but if it is base 97, with 2600 power, it should have been 109 damage prepatch and around 147 post patch. Which seems to line up with what he was reporting on the tooltip (might have more than 2600 power, I just chose an easy to hit round number).
---
Ahh I’m so torn now. Probably gonna scrap my condi scourge and just play both condi and power on my weaver.
---
You know the rules, ladies and gentlemen. Take a drink. I know, we lose another member to alcohol poisoning every patch... and every teatime stream... and every Saturday... and every day around 3pm... but take heart! Soon we'll have a winner of the drinking contest!
---
Ah okay, since it ignores armour, it has to behave differently. So it is an outlier, kind of like retal.
---
You're getting downvoted, but it's probably true. It's why Ancestral Grace is getting a fat nerf even though literally nobody is complaining about druids.
---
I mean, there could be a hundred videos but it's still a call to get it nicely situated on the wiki.
---
Buffed all the way from bad, to not good.
---
so... they didnt edit their upcoming change post and it's all the way on page 6? nice.
---
I totally agree
---
I bet there are people who want Guild Wars 2 Classic. Back before the expansions "ruined the game".
---
Just loaded in and tried it out.
---
Thoughts on Thief's new Shadow Portal preparation skill:
---
&gt; YAAASSS! This is everything I ever wanted from a Thief Portal!
---
* Where you prep it is where the portal outputs. 
---
* Perfect for jump puzzles and other PvE shenanigans
---
* High-risk-high-reward for WvW and PvP portal bombing. You have to put it near where you want to pop in ahead of time and all prep skills take 3 seconds to arm, but I imagine the stealth and weakness AoE can do wonders if used well.
---
* The cooldown counts down WHILE you've got it prepped. That's fantastic.
---
* Meld in Shadows doesn't increase the stealth time. Does that mean the statement about them being balanced as traited includes general trait interactions? :/
---
Thoughts on other changes:
---
* Potent Poison doesn't seem to be applying to Deadly Ambition. Bug/Oversight or intended?
---
* The other Prep skills look great. They're huge and feel worth the 3 second arm time.
---
* Leeching Venoms only stacks spider venom stack per 3 seconds. Not too exciting for non-perma-stealth thieves, but for perma-stealth ones, I can see it saving a utility slot or front load twice as much.
---
i actually feel like trying a benchmark to see how bad it is
---
and how does the harvesting sound in english?
---
Appearance of stowed effects is different, 1 has blue and pink, 2 has only pink and 3 is almost white.
---
Holo dancers often net me 7-9g
---
Also going for WoW Classic, not quiting GW2 for good but pausing, letting some new content to pile up. As is today GW2 does not keeping me busy enough. I plan to comeback just before next expansion.
---
I know, right? No one complained about Soulbeasts being unkillable unblockable monsters, or Revenants one-shotting people by pressing two buttons, or core Necro feeling like a downgrade from its elite specs, or Tempest feeling underwhelming. ANet why did you make all these useless changes no one asked for? Why?! Why couldn't you just leave everything exactly the way it was so I could whine like the little bitch that I am about how the game is dead!?
---
there is no diffrenc
---
No amounts of F could be pressed for continuum split in WvW.
---
Out of all the Chrono changes, this is the one I'm mad about the most. I've played Chrono as a main for almost 4 years, and the muscle memory you build over that time is not something you can forget.
---
However, I also play other classes... and they still have their F5's... so I guess, I'm screwed either way? Thanks, ANet, awesome design!
---
Looks like a solid buff to me. The changes to overloads in particular sound like they're going to spam out damage and condis pretty easily. And Weaver seems to have gotten a mix of buffs and maybe a nerf but also benefits from the core ele changes.
---
They didn't change it in a good way. 
---
Core mesmers had clone requirements for shatters, and there was actually a grandmaster trait that made a self-shatters possible. And you know what? In 2014, they made that trait baseline because it was pretty fucking mandatory for mesmer to work. 
---
And since then, everything has been worked with that thing in mind. It was not broken, it was required. Now they removed it. They backpedaled 5 years to change something that ABSOLUTELY did not need change.
---
Weird. Yeah all I knew was I had the wiki's page on upcoming changes loaded from before the patch went live and it had the change on it.
---
Thanks so much for this. I jumped right to step 3 last night. I’ll try and reinstall all drivers too before I bother trying again after work today.
---
I hope it isn’t hardware based as my rig is fairly new- ryzen 2400g and rx580 and 8ghz ddr4 2666 ram
---
Can someone double check that the preview and the actual patch have all the same changes? I looked around and didnt see any changes, but I read some comments saying that are further ones.
---
Wow, that's quality content!
---
Let's do an quick experiment to find out.
---
Damage done = (Weapon strength) * Power * (skill-specific coefficient) / (target's Armor)
---
Then this is multiplied by different multipliers like vulnerability (* 1.25), critical hits, which we can assume to be at max so (* 2), and finally damage modifiers like the 10% so (* 1.1)
---
Let the Skill-coefficient = x and the armor = y
---
Then taking ascended weapon strength, and assuming something like 3000 power for the sake of argument, altogether pre-patch it would look something like:
---
Damage = (1155 * 3000 * x/y) * 1.25 * 2 * 1.1 = 9,528,750 * x/y
---
Post patch, it would look like this:
---
Damage = (1155 * (3000 + 300) * x/y) * 1.25 * 2 = 9,528,750
---
Basically, if your starting off before the trait with power of 3001+, the 10% would be better. If it is 3000 or less, the 300 power would be better. This is true if staying only in fire. If you are moving into different elements, the 10% will probably be better.
---
that's all cool but juggling has never been a thng because you lose a giant mod while leaving forge.
---
RIP Chrono distortion. It was nice using you to save raid wipes.
---
Thank you so much. Take a look!
---
So basically, Scrapper continues to be the WvW engineer spec. Which... I'm actually totally fine with. Just wish it were easier to swap stats &amp; runes without having to grind out for a damn Legendary or buy more bank/bag space.
---
Mindless gold farming gets you pretty far though, the best cosmetics are usually in the shop anyway.
---
It says on each build Dueller, Bunker, +1, etc
---
The change to Dark Path seems cool, especially since it theoretically should turn into an AoE boon corrupt when traited. Core Necro certainly still needs some help to make it a better DPS option, but above all I really wish that they would let us sacrifice some of Necro's innate survivability in order to deal more damage, either by letting use choose to focus life force towards making DS a better sustain option or by focusing it towards DPS but taking more out of DS when hit, or by adding a trait that causes you to sacrifice health when casting skills, but having those skills deal increased damage as a result.
---
Still, at least Necro isn't in the gutter. The SE nerf kinda sucks, but now players just have to go back to playing a little safer than they were with SE sustain.
---
To be fair, Shroud for Reaper is far and away the biggest portion of your dps. If you fuck up mechanics and eat a bunch of damage through shroud, you're going to be hitting like a wet noodle until you build more life force.
---
Certainly better than being dead, but you're not exactly going to be smashing the dps meter even at the best of times, let alone I'd you have to stall your rotation to be rebuilding life force.
---
and birthday stuff too.
---
Another festival? At this rate s5 will start in september
---
And you play open world pve?
---
Fuck, I hope so
---
I highly doubt the other Enhanced Capacity storage unit is going to be all that good. Maybe someone will come up with a viable rotation but I kind of doubt it as you don't get lasers edge at all outside of the brief periods in forge mode. Not being able to use toolbelt skills off cooldown in after overheating will probably be a noticable DPS loss but I still doubt enhanced capacity will be able to keep up with it.
---
You spend so much of your time complaining that you didnt even bother to think 80+120=200 so now you get an 80 power benefit even when not with the revealed debuff. I get that this game is not in the spot we want it to be but you complain here and on the official forums nonstop. Just enjoy the game a little!
---
What does the glyph do?
---
Oof...
---
After checking the new chronomancer shatters...I am dumbfounded  
---
Making the "tradebacks" of using HoT specializations is ok. I WANT those to function differently indeed, it will create diversity.
---
But those goddamed devs forgot that...PoF specializations don't offer downgrades. They offer different sollutions. Different ways to play. Less adrenalin for having full counter. Longer cooldown for full tomes. Holoforge that takes one skill of you and is incredible risky to use (I think they forgot that in this patch). A dodge in place instead of a roll. The examples go on and on.  
---
But no. Chronomancer have to have a straight DOWNGRADE of the mesmer skills. What Chronomancer brings to the table that is so unique? A maximum of 6 seconds of using skills twice if you prepare yourself very well. In the class that already have Alacrity (but it is not the only one. Although it is the one that gains the most benefit from it.) and does not heal as well as Renegade anyway.  
---
The worst part is that my Chrono is just in one place gathering materials. It haven't been fun to play with Chrono for a while. Thanks I guess for that? Obviously Firebrand and Renegade have been the better option, with easier rotations, heals and more support AND DAMAGE than a Chrono + Healer.
---
By the way the lack of burn in symbols is also a pretty nerf for Dragon hunters, that HAVE to use Spear of Justice to keep dps.
---
We hate you too.   
---
Sincerely, Chronomancers.
---
Is there noone else at ANET since before pre-hot patch?
---
I have to disagree. I always see this comment being made but I don't really value the gem cosmetics. Aside from some armor pieces anyways.
---
I don't like outfits because you can't select specific pieces and I think most legendary weapons look better. 
---
And a lot of the nicer skins, IMO, are locked behind collections or raids (like the Dhuum helm and bloodstone crown).
---
I'm gonna say that's more of a villain faction than asura racial.  And I'm also gonna say hell yeah more villain faction chairs.
---
Come on, we need a non-Inquest Asura chair...
---
That chair is super cute :)
---
Core should be a downgrade from elite specs. That's why they're elite. Otherwise what's the point?
---
I mean, you killed Balthazar, that was a huge deal too. I think it's important to have some cliffhanger to an expansion to keep players hooked on the story as expansions are where you get a ton of new players.
---
&gt; Is there noone else at ANET since before pre-hot patch?
---
The people at analytics who said "hey, some of those Chrono mains still haven't bought PoF".
---
Condi ele tho...  My Conjure Earth Shield autoattacker just went up past 32K dps.  I can't imagine what a straight up condi weaver can do now.
---
Alright, after testing the thief changes, here are my thoughts. Preparations, I love em. Shadow Portal is basically Shadow Trap but not bugged, and really really nice to use. Seal Area is cute, and might be used for some disruptive nonsense, the other 2 are just the traps, but better. I like these changes. 
---
DA Trait changes: meh. Dagger Training is worse, and the new condi trait is kinda really bad in PvP and WvW since its 3 seconds of poison once every 5 seconds. You only use it becuase the other traits do nothing for you, and even then Im not convinced you dont just use Mug instead. Even the Odds is cute, but it competes with 2 traits that are just better.
---
And now, the big one, SA trait changes. Yeah these were awful. Merciful ambush heals and revives so little, its not even worth it. Hidden thief competing with embrace of shadows sucks, especially since the next traitline is kinda bad. Shadow Saviour suffers from the fact that there is no build that wants stealth benefits and also shadowsteps a lot. You either shadow step a lot, or you stealth a lot, not both. And you just cant pick this trait if you dont intend to go stealth. And you also cant if you do. Leeching Venom gives you *1* stack of Spider Venom every 3 seconds in stealth. 1. This is legit useless, you have to permastealth just to be able to get as much as a single cast of the skill, and its not like the skill is exactly great. Flickering Shadows is fine, but you kinda want the damage reduction most when you are *in* stealth, and we lost all of those.
---
And then the Grandmaster minor, and the grandmaster major traits. Hoo boy. So, we no longer take 33% less damage while in stealth. Instead we get 300 health per stealth attack. 300. This is nothing, especially with how bad stealth attacks are. We lost a ton of survivability to this, and it gets worse. Because now we have the new Cloaked in Shadow. The old one was pretty good for stealth heavy builds. Blind on stealth, and of course, complete immunity to crits in stealth. Now, we no longer are immune to crits in stealth. Instead, we get 66 health when blinding an enemy. And I did not miss a 0 there. Its legitimately *66* health per blind. You would have to blind 30 times, just to get as much survivability as not getting crit by a 2000 damage hit. 30 fucking times. This trait is so bad you could buff the healing 10-fold, and it would still be worse than the old one. 
---
In other words, SA got so thoroughly destroyed that its far worse than it ever has been, which is saying a lot. I dont get what the point was.
---
Yikes, those changes to Mallyx stance... It was the one stance mostly unburdened by cooldowns. Not looking forward to playing with that.
---
Biggest problem is you can't re-use them. Only got one. For 1600+ gold is a huge investment. I like the tier 1 and tier 2 effects, would love to wear them on multiple characters but atm you cant do that. 
---
Wonder when a wardrobe system for trinkets will come if ever.
---
As if in oPvE any of the changes could count as good.
---
Hell no. 
---
I'd rather they put them up on the gem store instead of locking them behind several years of waiting.
---
This is speculation Anet have not announced when festival of the four winds will start don't take what they said as true.
---
ACTUALLY, most of my time has been raids with some casual open world pve for shinies.
---
probably four winds information too
---
But that doesn't really say what it does, how to play it, etc.
---
I just realized that thieves no longer have a fall damage trait, I know they are kinda useless but I liked them for puzzles that block gliding... ahh what a shame, they could've at least combined with a minor trait in shadow arts.
---
Raids, ok, that makes for some more clunkier rotations and stuff. Ever played pvp or wvw? Well, good for you i guess, cus it's deleted.
---
Okay. What do they look like?
---
The one on lfg? It seems that one is deserted, but I'll try to check it if there is one later.
---
I don't mind the tradeoff, but they should probably make the forge mode more potent with such a large tradeoff, so it has the burst window and the "cooling" window
---
It would be interesting but as it is right now its just a nerf
---
It will be on the gemstore. The image has the typical size of a gemstore banner image.
---
&gt; but above all I really wish that they would let us sacrifice some of Necro's innate survivability in order to deal more damage
---
Yeah, I still can't believe Anet removed death shroud with scourge just to make it a, 'heavy support'.  What a missed opportunity.
---
* Find your server's official discord, join it and get verified. Mic is optional but listening to commander is highly recommended.

* If you want to play in a zerg, gear your Necro for [this Power Scourge build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Power_Scourge) instead. if you want to solo or small group roam, check the builds on the bottom of [this section](http://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW).

It will be when it have a easer rotation/way to buff other AT LEAST.

Renegade and Firebrand just need the press of a button. Chronos need to place the well and PRAY for its allies to be in the same place after 3 seconds.
---
Season 4 added 2 exotic weapon sets and 2 ascended weapon sets. 2 exotic armour sets with upgradeable skins. Each episode meta achievement gave another skin. And to get them, guess what you have to do? Play the game. So saying that there are no rewards for play is BS.
---
Well, 2600 is a conservative power number that is easily maintained.  3500 is the power you max out at with food and might.  And when you add in all the damage percentage traits and vulnerability (I believe I am mathing this right):
---
Base Prepatch: 97 + (3500*.0048) = 114
---
Vicious Lacerations: 9% (+10.2)
---
Rising Tide: 7% (+8)
---
Ferocious Aggression: 7% (+8)
---
Reinforced Potency: 7% (+8)
---
Forceful Persistance: 13% (+14.8)
---
Sigil of Force: 5% (+5.7)
---
Sigil of Impact: 3% (+3.4)
---
Damage with traits (+58): 172
---
Vulnerability: 25% (+43)
---
Targeted Destruction: 12.5% (+21)
---
**PREPATCH TOTAL: 236 dmg**
---
Base Post Patch: 97 + (3500*.0192) = 164
---
Vicious Lacerations: 9% (+14.7)
---
Rising Tide: 7% (+11.4)
---
Ferocious Aggression: 7% (+11.4)
---
Reinforced Potency: 7% (+11.4)
---
Forceful Persistance: 13% (+21.3)
---
Sigil of Force: 5% (+8.2)
---
Sigil of Impact: 3% (+4.9)
---
Damage with traits (+83): 247
---
Vulnerability: 25% (+61)
---
Targeted Destruction: 12.5% (+30)
---
**POSTPATCH TOTAL: 338 dmg**
---
So, roughly 100 more damage on every hit assuming everything is in your favor. Again, assuming I have mathed it all out right when I can't log in to test. 😅
---
Ha, different tastes I suppose.  I never was too interested in the armor from raids, the legendary armor in particular I find ugly.  Some pretty f the weapon skins are nice... but most of the legendaries look better and I generally find gold being the big time sink with crafting them as well
---
He is right those. He only stated facts. Best of luck in WoW Classic Teapot!
---
F for pve holo. Rest in pieces sweet Prince
---
ofc, just count the minimum time between episodes, 3 months, and May-June-July-August-September. (Should be August but they will probably have workers on vacation around that time
---
Weaver makes perma burn anyways, it’s a non factor
---
Well the concept of the bonus weeks are to bridge the gap between big releases. So either season 5 is revealed next week and released in the first week of August (which is in the 2 to 3 month time window). Or we get Festival of the Four Winds revealed next week.
---
It's delayed until the next build apparently  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/82161/world-boss-rush-event-coming-later-today](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/82161/world-boss-rush-event-coming-later-today)
---
This has the bigger impact for me
---
The game is pretty stale now after 6 years. I only log in now to flip the tp and buy occasional stuff on the gem store.  Not even sure why I do that though.  I'm finding infinitely more enjoyment from cell phone games like final fantasy brave exvius or dragalia lost at this point lol, it's totally replaced my mmo itch.
---
I actually expected they would have PBM reduce lockout time for the toolbelt. Removing the new penalty with a single trait would just be awkward design and double down on the problems with PBM. What we got this patch is worst case scenario for raid holo, but was probably the simplest to implement.
---
The patch didn't change much for Chronos regarding playstyle. It seems they tried to create some kind of synergy between shatters, but the restriction to use a shatter only when you have a clone active is a hindrance to it.
---
Putting it in a simple and straightforward way: they nerfed Chronos
---
No it did not, just auto attacking in earth/fire is like 20k ABSOLUTE MAX
---
Agreed. They look gorgeous.
---
RIP Chrono.  No self shatter despite Mirage and Core allowing it.
---
I really don't get why ANet feel the need to FUCK ABOUT with Chrono every single balance patch.
---
And RIP 4 years of muscle memory bound to the F5 key.
---
Signets are fine for open world; their whole point is to give passive perks all the time, every other utility type is situational.
---
Realize that in most GW2 content, "optimal" is used to describe "most DPS" or group buffs when needed in certain situations.
---
I was wondering when the anet Fanatic fan boys would come in to down vote you into oblivion. Looks like it took a few hours.
---
The game is 7 years old, is the literal definition of content draught and is beyond it's prime. Of course people are quitting and content creators want to move to something else before they are irrelevant.
---
It’s literally still the best pug carrier it just feels worse to play now, useless changes ._.
---
Guess it's time to stick with my no-stealth bouncy DD
---
You're using a dragonhunter, get traps instead.
---
I mean if that was your goal then Mirage would have been better from the start
---
Decent buff to power builds, massive buff for condi builds.
---
It's fairly squishy, but it's not too difficult.  You mainly cycle through air, fire, and water attunements.  It's a lot of fun though!
---
So either very small or hugely game-breaking depending whether you play chrono or not
---
is the current API broken? I can't get any of them to work with GW2Efficiency, does it break after every patch?
---
Changed CS key is more painful than I thought. I just wanted to test numbers in fractal but couldn't do so because of this. Anet found a whole new way to annoy chrono users.
---
Not only is the removal of self shattering possibly the most idiotic decision made since the introduction of aoe evade well, placing a 1 second distortion on a 105 second cooldown as your only defensive shatter is also grossly overnerfing and unnecessary. This confirms that no one with any say at Anet has any clue how mesmer works whatsoever in pvp/wvw.
---
This, I played a lot of XIV, it's boring and I like the combat here better.
---
They said it will be released after ls4 and according to usual release periods. That's 3-4 months, more like 4 I guess.
---
It might take me awhile to prepare, but better than not knowing anything. I've been thinking of playing as scourge for awhile now and I think I have the right weapons for it for power build. I'll definitely check the ones you've mentioned. Thank you for the pointers!
---
I'm still hoping for a paragon themed elite spec with spear that treats the virtues more akin to tempest overloads/auras.
---
shadowy
---
Midevil fighting game.
---
Very very fast paced but also very fun.
---
LFG, or just when you're in the map!
---
Yeah...I know what it is, you spelled the name wrong.
---
Apparently Anet could give enough F’s for Chrono
---
Firebrand healer is preferred in T4. You can actually get away with Renegade healing in CMs if your group dps is high enough, but  various T4s have some really unpleasant encounters that when combined with unfavorable instabilities, result in too much pressure for a heal Renegade to handle.
---
He usually does if there is story stuff or big surprises.
---
Yes. Although I think he shared some last year :)
---
Yeah you dont actually play holosmith
---
Actually I desperately need the t3 blob because the purple is overwhelming from the other two and t3 is more neutral colors
---
Well I guess you could also grind for an endless upgrade extractor.
---
neat

Came expecting sarcasm.. now curiosity is peaked.
---
Dirty dataminer reveals all!
---
Developers hate him!
---
That's what I expect, too. I played WoW from Classic release to mid-WotLK and it was my first MMO. It was great fun because it was new, different from what I had played before, and it was typical Blizzard quality. There is a reason why WoW became as big as it was.
---
And yet ... take away the fact that everything was new and it doesn't look as shiny anymore. Class balance was absolute bullshit, there was a lot of tedious grind and raid encounters, let's face it, were rather rudimentary. Raids were only difficult because you had 40 people with little experience. Thinking of Wildstar, which tried to revive 40-man raiding (one of the worst ideas they had), I wish good luck to all those new WoW Classic raid groups trying to maintain a roster of 50+ people. Guess they'll need it.
---
MMOs (including WoW) have changed in those 15 years since WoW launched. Some aspects have been improved, some have deteriorated, but it's a very different thing now. People have changed, too - students of back then will have a job and/or family now, with the corresponding time constraints. While there will certainly be some classic lovers who rejoice over the new servers, I am really not convinced that WoW is as compatible to the "masses" as some people imagine it to be.
---
Wonderful job! Thanks for contributing to the wiki!
---
You won't believe what happens next!
---
{brought to you by Outbrain}
---
I always thought that was a rev gripping a spear near the head. But now I look closely I see the shaft doesn't really continue. Also, that's a fairly awkward way to grip a dagger. Unless he wants to stab the Asura below him.
---
Maybe we'll get glass cannon Necromentalist in the next expansion/LS installment.
---
Do away with the second health bar, crank the damage up to 11 and give it access to a firearm of some kind.
---
 Sorted.
---
What chest armour did you use that shows off the tats like that?
---
I feel like the clone requirements to shatter are the bigger problem. 
---
Losing a distortion sucks but the clone reqs basically ruin the class for PvP/wvw
---
yes pls, or at least have the keys under the currency. Quite annoying scrolling up and down :p
---
Apparently if you did not accept the reward of last season until this season began you get the new version of titles.
---
&gt; you cast **stuff**
---
Yes, that's the point, it fucks up your rotation. This trait allowed you to cotinue your rotation normally while maintaining scholar.
---
Ooooo. Dang, sounds like an oversight. Oh well. Thanks
---
Yeah the EotM map refreshed and thus concluded the gvg scrim.
---
Honestly, if you're mainly concerned around losing 1v1 fights, then you should really spend a bunch of time in pvp. Wvw is sadly not a great place to learn how to duel because there's so much differences in gear.
---
The good thing is reaper and beserker are pretty brilliant at one on ones, so the class isn't hurting you. I've played a ton of wvw and sadly it doesn't really teach you much about duelling the way pvp does, since there's so many random factors that can get in the way of a fight. I found spending just a few hours and working my way up to gold (which isn't even that high) was enough to have a substantial impact on my skill while duelling.
---
Your CPU and RAM are better than mine (not sure rx580 or GTX 1070 is better) so it shouldn't be hardware. I do have 16gb RAM though and the developer himself did mention 8gb might have problems.
---
The point is prob like acrobatics. Butcher the trait line then make a new elite spec out of it
---
Again, tysm and especially for the links. These will be helpful for a noob like me in wvw. I'll be checking them when I get home. I also find the lfg tool for wvw to be empty everytime, so my only chance probably is asking in map chat in wvw. It might be my timezone as well that I don't see any commander tags when I check wvw, but definitely looking for my server's discord and ask them.
---
Welp this is it boys. The start of the end of a game.

inb4: "great, more visual cancer!"
---
The power overwhelming change was already in the first notes
---
Nonononono o! No dirty!
---
I stopped playing fracs when with the december balance patch, when they removed full support for chrono. and I used to play full support in oPvE too. Now that I played only dps chrono in oPvE they want to ruin that fun too it seems. having a distort ready all the time is essential for surviving, combining it with the F5 is deadly.
---
To each its own, I don't like 10 persons afk like in vinewrath because we beat it anyway. On the marionette if you afk you don't kill it. That was the pure joy of it. It was a world boss for everyone to contribute doing an specific role, kinda like Tequatl **for the first months** after the revamp.
---
They made demon stance for revenant rely solely on one skill to apply torment. What nice ''dynamic'' and ''engaging'' gameplay change...
---
Keep some surprise!!!! It’s actually not fun knowing every single detail ahead of time through a data mine post. Let arenanet enjoy the fruits of their labor through an official post announcing their work xD
---
https://status.gw2efficiency.com/
---
works fine here
---
This is actually a good step in the right direction, people can complain about effects etc all the time, but that is because most skill effects are just mashes of random lights and colors, these, even though they are fairly large, you KNOW what they are by looking at them, which is what GW2 needs more of, especially in PvP, large effects may seems bad on paper, but if they don't have lingering animations (aka if they are short enough), and are easy to distinguish what is actually causing the effect, its much better.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Late corrective patch note: Basilisk Venom no longer stuns on hit.
---
GORDON'S ALIVE!!!???
---
Wait, why don't we have capes as a back piece in game???
---
&gt;It’s actually not fun knowing every single detail ahead of time through a data mine post.
---
Don't open it then lol.
---
Some people like these posts, they're helpful.
---
I am also getting this issue, I just started on my first legendary yesterday, and now its kinda borked making it really hard to keep up with what I need to buy :(
---
No news or anything about anything upcoming. I don't feel like the game is dying but I can understand that no news after a time of slow hype "season 5 incoming" and seeing an empty patch (aside from balance) can be depressing.
---
Shame, it was an interesting one.
---
I've never been a fan of Renegade myself, I always thought the lower damage wasn't worth it but looking at arcdps maybe I should give it another try. (Or maybe I'm just bad)
---
it could be a human sword, considering that that is a norn.
---
how about instead of locking them all up from you they put them on cooldown as if they were used just now (so the low-cooldown toolbelt skills are only on a low cooldown, and this would benefit from alacrity)
---
Gimme back my shatters ;\_;
---
What build do you use in WvW?
---
That wasn’t for thatshaman that was for the joke above. Scroll up we’re talking about the big surprise he’s hiding which we are all excited for. 
---
Lol.
---
If you don't see any commanders on your current map, use team chat "/t" to ask all maps.
---
You misdrew your griffon! :( Your Griffon will be sad to be portrayed so poorly.
---
Clearly, everybody's best friend is their Griffy... right? 
---
right?
---
Go play a DD pre steal changes and post steal changes from last patch.
---
This is nothing. Stop whining.
---
This is coming from a mesmer main, who also chronos in raids/fractals.
---
I don't really see why any such nerf is necessary when the PvE holo builds already weren't in a great spot. SC didn't even bother posting benchmarks for sword holo last time.
---
Ah I know that but I was just saying, that's the reason why people are sad/upset.
---
He is consistently a moron who sides with ANet on literally everything. As far as he argues, they can do no wrong in his eyes. Save your breath trying to argue with him, flag him with RES, downvote him every time you see him.
---
Jokes on you mesmers! now thieves have portal too!
---
Remember, if you use spear of justice = no passive burn. Symbols used to help you burn without the passive with spear of justice on cool down. So you really only get the burn from the spear.
---
they do look sick!
---
RIP renegade
---
we knew about that before patch though
---

---
They feel like garbage in PvE too so far. In open world your clones shatter as soon as anything you target dies, so I feel like as soon as any shatter is up I need to use it to get ANY benefit. After about 10 minutes I parked him next to a mining node and forgot about him.
---
How does this information make "dealing with the tethers sub 20% quite possible"? With all the movement for distortions/mechanics, I don't think it is feasible to keep the tether targets isolated away from the main group. Maybe you could have them all stack on the tank with one of them being a healer, but the range by which they link to other players seems to be quite large.
---
The only consistent recourse seems to be going full ranged, which I already mentioned. However, this has its own significant DPS tradeoffs and doesn't seem to be worthwhile in my experience.
---
Have you had success isolating the tether targets during the final phase? In my experience, it's been one of those things that requires too much coordination and is too easy to mess up compared to just stacking and burning through it.
---
Chrono changes tl;dr.
---
Deleted from wvw scene.
---
10% only applied to fire attunement I thought, wheras this trait applies always even though it's only 150 power outside of fire.
---
PvE Holo relied on Photonic Blasting Module, which benefited from Overheating. 
---
Before the patch, when Holo overheated they couldn't enter PForge for some seconds, losing some damage, but the damage loss could be compensated a bit with Toolbelt skills. 
---
Now, to farther punish Holos for overheating, ANet decided to disable Toolbelt skills until Heat reaches back to 0. This leads to loss of a couple of benefits from toolbelt traits, loss of DPS, quickness from traits... 
---
It's a bad change, they should have made that when you choose Photonic Blasting Module trait is active, you don't lose your toolbelt skills.
---
wasn't in the original preview though
---
incredible artwork! Well done.
---
The seal reminds me of shonen animes
---
This is what I talk about when people are so ingrained in 'Metabattle or bust'.
---
Okay, I did.
---
Mesmer players still have things about forty times worse. Even if this one change wasn't as bad as the DD stuff last patch (I do personally think it's worse), Chrono has been getting these fundamentally spec changes updates every 3 months since PoF or even slightly before.
---
Thief isn't even on the same scale yet.
---
I really hope not having festivals back to back are a bad idea. I hope season 5 episode 1 is ready to release in the first week of August that allows us 2-3 weeks of new story content and likely new fractal as fractals have usually come with every 2nd episode. This should take us up to or close to the 7th anniversary and boom they release festival of the four winds and that becomes the anniversary content. This gives a break between festivals which is a good thing.
---
Other than losing out on the "1 free one in your first 1000 chests" mechanic...not really no.
---
Axe is really the only Main Hand I could see that would fit. Kind of like scenes where an Axe just flies in out of nowhere to embed itself in someone's skull, something ranged like how Ranger uses them. After the reaction to Rifle I can't see them following Deadeye up with a Longbow Elite Spec. The rest of the weapons just seem out of place as a Warhorn isn't exactly what I would consider "stealthy", nor are Greatswords, Hammers, etc.
---

---
MLP reference made in a gw1 quest you fool.
---
What makes me angrier is that I though at least continuum split would have the distortion cooldown of 50 seconds, or the chrono shatters would be more powerful. Nope, they are exactly the same as the core mesmer, and continuum split and distortion have that terrible cooldown. Still they cost more, can't always be used, they don't happen at your position, and chronos can't really spam clones at will....unless we get scepter chronos.
---
Three of the "stolen" traps were replaced with new, better versions of what they did before.  The fourth (Ambush) was replaced with a new (for Thief) effect that has very powerful applications both defensively and offensively, either sealing enemies into an area or out of an area while simultaneously blocking projectiles.
---
I'm choosing to see this comment as sarcasm. I'll upvote you back to -44!
---
This is what's usually called a "no true scotsman" informal fallacy.
---
Most of the tool belt skills are instant cast anyway. It doesn't do all that much to PvE.
---
In PvP, where no one was running this trait anyway, it is nerfed, which is the dumb part.
---
And if you somehow manage to pull a continuum split with 3 clones, all they have to do is wait for you at the  continuum rift to burst you down because you get no distort on return.
---
Very inactive subreddit and no new posts. I have just counted 53 new posts in the past 24 hours.
---
hell yea brother
---
I distinctly recall something about mesmer shatters requiring a clone being changed back when specializations were becoming a thing.
---
Well stealth is still GOOD but only as a disenage and some other niche use tool.
---
I'm amazed that this comment somehow got upvotes. Usually when you criticize the shininess you instantly get jumped. I totally agree with you btw.
---
That.. is actually pretty nice
---
I would like to try this with you and some other commanders, Hertz. When you're thinking of trying this hit me up
---
Shush. I finally found a support class I really like, just let me have this one thing.
---
&gt; Thief isn't even on the same scale yet.
---
You're right. Thief was in a much worse state...maybe preparation skills and today's balance changes will help change that.
---
Fractal based questions. I'm just starting to gear up and get to know the fractals. I know there is a daily run, I assume you can do the run for each tier correct? i.e I've got enough AR for T2 so I can do both T1 and T2 dailies.  
---
I'd really like to get to know the fracs better. Is there any issue with me joining multiple PUGs doing daily runs or should you only do one per day?
---
Seems its not, having it right now. (Haven't had it at all before)
---
I hate this patch, dont even want to play dps chrono anymore 😭😭
---
Yeah but you could hide behind a greatsword
---
Just give it time :P
---
I would fucking hope not since borderlands 3 and many other games will draw more attention Lol
---
The fact that you've never actually played DD at a high skill level, beyond open world PvE is showing very clearly.
---
Silly, but for a moment, I thought the Seal trap had a boulder roll in from offside. But nah, beetle race track. XD
---
People are busy drawing their main chars.
---
Not only can the chrono rewind time but also needs to be able to see the future. IMMERSION 100
---
They just put the word trap in quotation marks, basically. I imagine it's less salt like the OP cousins and more just inability to accurately translate right now.
---
In about 2 hours or so, I will make you realize the stupidity in that statement.

---
Well the boss rush stuff is live with the patch and that's the majority this time around. Usually future gemstore and whatnot is the majority of the past, is what I meant by "not really this time".
---
I'm betting you're just hiding most stuff added due to birthday or S5 spoilers, as you usually do.
---
For me it was working fine until the fix. Now I am not able to join the queue...
---
preparations are just traps with a trigger. so the text in german is prepare "trap"...trap in quotation marks since its not a trap anymore.
---
If you could stop overreacting for a minute and being so biased, maybe you'd realize that some classes have had it MUCH worse for almost 7 years now.
---
Power chrono was such a fun class to play for me. Now it feels very clunky and not fun at all.
---
They haven't announced it but they did update the crown pavilion (mainly the white mantle area) with the dragon bash patch so they probably have plans to at least bring it back this year
---
No new outfits added? What to talk about?
---
Much love for Longbow Dragonhunters.
---
I think it would've been better if they just disabled F4 but left F5 as it were.
---
Press F4 to pay respects.
---
They do seem a bit much. However, i would far more prefer ovrr the top skill animations over over the top cosmetic auras.
---
&gt;Next update in two weeks.
---
[hmmmmmmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TyCp5v0jgc)
---
&gt; And the thing is, it's affected in pve the least.
---
*endgame PvE. There's also open world where it's battered beyond belief.
---
Rewinder time!
---
The equivalent of illusionary persona removal is needing full endurance on thief to steal...
---
That doesn't make sense. If PBM was *the* trait to go for for dps then surely that limits build diversity. And since you contend that it still might be then why are people complaining?
---
Now, sure, if one compares classes then it's possible PBM wasn't really in need of a nerf but there's internal balancing to contend with as well. So ArenaNet have to look at possibilities/builds within a single spec, within the same class and between classes. Personally, I'd rather they find a good balance from inside outwards (i.e. within spec then within class then between classes) as that should theoretically make it easier to balance overall as the overall balance changes should then affect the inner balance within clases too much.
---
I'd have said holosmiths need tool belt skills to deal competitive dps in a dps spec, and that they already hurt themselves when overheating while giving up an elite tool belt slot. But hey, here we are.
---
So maybe other dps specs need to have their capabilities crippled to achieve parity, right?
---
Didn't really look at the Ren changes, how did they get buffed?
---
OMG, OMG, a gamemode where you can click yourself through things with 1 finger. Nothing matters in open world pve.....
---

this is your rotation anyway
---
I forget the name at this moment but I'm tallying about the text on the right that tells player nearby quest. It's customizable to a certain extent for personal story but I often want to hide it completely.
---
But also vision needs 16 weeks of wings 5 to 7 raiding for divinations.
---
oh no you have to cast the skills that are already in your rotation! What a loss!
---
Prep skills seem like they'll be fun in PvP and WvW. Will they get a lot of neat use in PvE though? I mean, don't get me wrong they seem pretty solid, but they feel like ambush preparation skills which... don't serve much purpose in PvE.
---
Also I want to say now, I dislike the name 'preparation', feels bland compared to most other skill types.
---
It will be a small buff anyways, since the lost 10% modifier was only active while you're in Fire. Now you're getting 300 power there instead, but you're also getting 150 of that power all the time.
---
Finally, my time to shine... slightly brighter.
---
But not much.
---
New legendaries coming December 2015!
---
Where is this secret source you have for Anet's current resource allocation? I'd love to read it too
---
He's moving on, nothing you can do about it. I'm not concerned in the slightest but I am concerned with these anet partners that keep the doom/gloom train on their streams weekly and complains about how reddit community doesn't really know their opinions. Yet, give a 2 hour livestream of their opinions and how they hold sway to people such as yourself with the state of the game. If your own opinions of the game match it then by all means let your voice be heard but don't let one youtube/twitch personality ruin the game for you. Let that be in your own mind and decisions.
---
Discord. I admit I like to spend some time reading the publicly available channels on SnowCrows Discord after every balance patch. Gives me an idea of what other folks are trying, what results they're getting, and what I can do to improve my builds.
---
ANet took away their primary energy-dumping attack in Mallyx - Unyielding Anguish - but buffed the Mallyx elite Embrace the Darkness to compensate. The elite now adds 2 stacks of torment to each attack you use while it's active, with a 1 second cd. This results in slightly more damage overall.
---
That too!
---
If bow had more symbol uptime itd help a lot in pve but now a lot of dmg is constantly having symbols down.
---
Maybe, maybe not. If Blizzard takes the "Old School Runescape" approach, and creates new content for the old game, it will likely do very well. If not, it will be dead in a few years
---
The changes were completely uncalled for. Holo wasn't weak but it also wasn't the best possible pick, it stayed like that quite a few patches.
---
Now both PBM and ECU are parsing for 29k DPS, so effectively the new reaper meme boys
---
GW2 and FFXIV player here
---
&gt; leveling experience
---
GW2 has a faster and more mobile feel to it's gameplay, especially in early levels compared to FFXIV. In FF there is a good chance that you only have like 5 skills to press until level 50.
---
&gt; fillercontent
---
Depends on what you're playing in GW2. Dungeons,fractals and raids (and ofc pvp/wvw) you have to focus. If you're doing leveling,hearts, world bosses, meta events, sometimes you can just go afk and let your char autoattack. Also depends on your build a bit.
---
In FFXIV there are fates (open world events) and your classic quests, but at least on your first class you don't have to do many of them, because you gain your most exp from the story and dungeons you have to do. Because FFXIV utilizes the holy trinity you can't go afk even in low dungeon.
---
&gt; story quality
---
Before playing FFXIV I thought the GW2 story was really good, and it's surely not trash, but I like the FFXIV story way more. The start can be a bit slow, but also the GW2 early story is considered the more boring part.
---
&gt; amount of content that is still done by the community
---
GW2: Because there is no gear progression, most of the content is still more or less relevant. People tend to go to the maps that give them the most loot tho. Dungeons are dead, but if you open your own lfg you most likely can still find a group.
---
FFXIV: Content get's outdated, but because of random daily roulettes and the party finder you will still find groups to do stuff with. But it will take more time to find a group if you are a dps player. (but that's normal in this game :D )
---
&gt; ease of finding friendly groups
---
I find both communities to be very friendly, but FFXIV is a more social game. Until you want to do instanced group content in GW2 you can play the game mostly alone. FFXIV pushes you every time to join a group for a dungeon, but I never had a really bad encounter there.
---
&gt; amount and quality of the solo-content
---
GW2: As I said, very solo-content heavy/friendly.
---
FFXIV: No way around, get your ass in a group or deinstall. :-]
---
&gt; total amount of content 
---
GW2: Depends on your focus. Open world, collectibles,achievements, exploration - very much content. Dungeons are not supported anymore. Fractals and raids exist, but the releases are very slow.
---
FFXIV: Story is very long, but enjoyable, many dungeons, many raids. Open world is more or less just some other quests and fates.
---
&gt; gameplay variety with different builds
---
GW2: very diverse in how you can build and play your class, but keep in mind that there is still a meta if you want to do fractals/raids and there is always a more efficient way to play a class.
---
FFXIV: Every class plays different, but the armor have set stats, so you can just tweak your stats a bit with materia. 
---
&gt; playerbase and how long the game is likely to last
---
I think both games will still last at least a few years, but FFXIV is definitely bigger and has more money and resources they can spend on new content.
---
Tbh in FFXIV the classes and combat only gets interesting at level 60/70+. Also it's story is a bit boring at first, but with the first addon I got really invested into it and all the chars and the new addons story is a blast.
---
In GW2 the leveling aspect is more fun, but I think it's harder to get into the endcontent. If you want to do fractals you need to farm gear and infusions and that will also take some time and for raids you have to join a raiding guild, otherwise it will be hard to join exp groups.
---
I switched to FFXIV after playing GW2 for almost 7 years and I really enjoy the change. But GW2 is a great game, but for veterans the content release is too slow. So if you are new, you will have plenty to do.
---
Definitely agree, don't reward the loyal players, charge em cash.
---
/s
---
you just read till the boost part didn't you
---
Core warrior has, for the longest time, been preferred over its specs for raid content. Core guardian is stronger than DH in PvP. And ANet have specifically been trying to buff core specs so they are stronger and the elite spec feels like a choice to specialize rather than an upgrade.
---
Reaper didn't GET nerfs. The trait is identical aside from now not healing in shroud. There was no DPS loss and now the Reaper has to go back to what they've always done which is trusting their healer to heal them rather than hiding in shroud and healing.
---
Holo is maybe nerfed maybe not. Laser edge changes and Enhanced capacity mean we're getting rotation changes and we'll see if they end up buffed or nerfed. It seems like a buff to spike damage and encouraging players to pay attention to when a boss is vulnerable to maximize their DPS. Druid was last patch and it doesn't feel great, but it's good for the health of the game. If you want to do damage, you don't go the healer elite spec. So far, it's the only real healer spec in the game aside from maybe tempest.
---
Tempest has been underperforming in almost every game mode under Weaver. No one takes Tempest support if they can get a druid instead.
---
No one's worshipping changes, I just don't see them as idiotic. A LOT of the changes here are ones I've wanted to see for months. Others are interesting, particularly Thief changes, and I'm interested to see what people come up with. But it has to be more than "MY CLASS IS DEAD" posts because you clearly haven't thought through the changes.
---
Haha yeah I actually just found the same video in the RA discord as well.
---
Any suggestions to replace sword holo in raids? Since they gutted it I need a new power option with a really simple rotation. Maybe some thief spec? Please advise.
---
Agree to disagree, I guess. I find the core VA abysmal in almost every turn. I'll take wisecracking over soul-less VA work any day.
---
As a thief player it feels good to see mesmer fucked over one last time nefore i quit the game.

This is SO GOOD!!  :D

First of all, welcome to Tyria, fellow adventurer :)
---
Second, if you want to got for the really super shiny skins, most of them are available in the Gemstore, but not all. Legendary Armour from Raids is pretty shiny, too (search for "Perfected" in the Wardrobe in the bank to check them out). Legendary Armour from PvP and WvW is also super shiny. I would also advise to have a look at the Dungeon Armour sets, they can be pretty neat, too.
---
After all, most skins can be obtained by playing the game, but gemstore usually has the sets that most ppl would prefer (obviously, wouldn't be in gemstore otherwise).
---
Outfits are also nice to go super-shiny without much effort.
---
Actually, the entire balance team is almost identical to the team they had before HoT. Organizational memory isn't the problem here, it's simply that they're all incompetent morons.
---
New ability.
---
Spray: Your Warclaw rears its hind legs and marks its territory. If you are in enemy territory, the area is immediately made neutral. If the territory is neutral, it immediately becomes owned by your Warclas. Enemies caught in the cone of the attack are blinded, poisoned, and inflicted with 10 stacks of torment.
---
seems that youre report cames out from a run where no one dig chest and and no one do dolyak events with upscale
---
Hi, glad to see you're enjoying the game so far
---
There's a few options for cosmetic items. Those glowing gloves could be a variety of things, depending on how they glow
---
[Chaos gloves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Gloves_Skin) are gemstore purchases, sitting at 500 gems when they come back into rotation. Depending on how the market exchange looks, this could be anywhere from 100 gold to 200 gold, but likely closer to a middle range of about 150. Once you get into the groove of things, 150 gold is farmable within a few days to a week if you're not trying super hard, but you do have to know how to make gold properly
---
Another option is the [radiant vambraces](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Radiant_Vambraces_Skin) for example, which are either 3000 achievement points or 12000, depending on your choices. The first 3000 are easy, do dailies every day for 10 AP, and just play the game naturally and that will climb within the first few months max. Getting to 12000 is a little more difficult but definitely not that bad, but I'd give that more than a year personally if you aren't trying to farm points.
---
And finally, [exalted gloves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted_Gloves_(consumable\)), which can be bought with black lion statuettes. You earn some of those with every black lion chest you open, which means you need keys. You can either buy keys off the gem store or just key farm, earning about 1 key a week.
---
In general, if you go to your bank, and click on the wardrobe tab (looks like a dresser), you can look at all the possible skins in game. Just find some you like, and go to the wiki and see if you can find out how to earn them
---
Good luck doing that with Holo
---
The same for thief with SA changes and a sick new portal.
---
I think they're nerfing lots of elite specs so core classes are more viable which is fcking dumb in my book. Why shouldn't elite specs be better? The whole point is that you've mastered the class and have even more specialty with your class. I guess they need to make sure the f2p players don't feel gimped.
---
Yeah, it's totally reasonable to say Anet is lying to their parent company and is secretly working on other projects despite NCSoft shutting those down.
---
As for the "millions" figure? Yeah, I pulled it out of "the ass." Fact of the matter is tons of people play Dragonfall and world boss rush while only a tiny group whines about raids that no one else wants to play. If more people liked what you consider "content" then Anet would be making it.
---
Hey someone got problem entering all instances after downloading this patch?
---
Is this theif spec for next expac? Im out of the loop here someone got a any info?
---
Portal exit is where you set it, and entry where you activate it, so pretty much works the same as mesmer portal, so it works to get people inside objectives.
---
Don't you enjoy one-time phantasms, herding cats into your wells for boons, a quadruple-nerfed Mimic and getting F4 taken away? Give it another six months, I'm sure Anet finds more Mesmer mechanics they can remove.
---
&gt; the most impactful shatter was F4 and we now get that for 'free'
---
Do we though? The new combined F4 is on a 105s cooldown, so distortion F4 was effectively deleted, and I can't think of (m)any encounters where Continuum Shift was being held for defense instead of being used to double up on other (offensive/buffing) cooldowns.
---
&gt;Skins unlock account wide when you soulbind an item.
---
Not quite. That depends on it being your classes preferred armor/weapon. I tried binding some leather on my hunter and was disappointed that I didn't get the appearance. I can only get it from chain on my hunter. I need to mail it to other characters.
---
I can't just salvage it and get the appearance, like in GW2.
---
Your other points are correct and I didn't consider them. I don't normally go and get raid skins because I don't raid, and mounts are still collectible, yeah.
---
I mean, it's different monetary incentives that come with subscription versus F2P. I'd honestly rather see GW2 as a subbed game that has the regular income to live up to its potential and get the polish it needs versus what it is now. I'd pay for that.
---
Indeed. Even though I can‘t be mad on him cuz he does an incredible job. Time will tell I guess.
---
I don't know about thieves, but dragonhunters have a straightforward rotation with a lot of burst and survivability.
---
More and more these "horses" are becoming less feasible.
---
Does anybody have a similar benchmark for laptops using Ryzen 7? Looking for a new laptop but wondering if this is anywhere near comparisons (micro stutter is my gripe) for laptop Vs tower. Also examples for sale would be &lt;3
---
I would honestly rather have you not post anything if you are not going to post everything. There is too much power in having information and withholding it just seems like a flex of that power.
---
Of course it's a "Fashion Wars". What better way to kill Qadim then blinding him through sheer clashing sets. What better way to show off to your foes in WvW that you re coordinated mass of pain then running around in jarring neon colours palletes that only the blind are spared from. You're not thinking in the wider scope of things.
---
Thank you, we have probably quite opposite tastes, i don't mind farming a spot for 10h straight, back in the time i spent over 18h doing close to nothing flying around it's 3 spawn points just to get [this](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=35189/skoll) guy, on my first attempt i had my pet out so it got insta killed, the 2nd some dude from the opposite faction killed it while i was taming, it was only the third time I managed to tame that beast, worth every second.
---
I'm not quite the pvp guy you may have noticed  but i guess that by the videos i'v been seeing ill get to enjoy this game pvp as i did on the old days on Ragnarok, EVE and Rising Force
---
This build is actually insane right now, wow! 32k and you give up so much damage by running Sanctuary runes when you could just pair this with a support Scourge for permanent barrier with a much stronger rune.
---
Scrapper dead. Holo dead. Reaper dead. Chrono dead. Condi thief dead. Mallyx dead. PVP Druids dead.
---
They've really done a number on this game.
---
The meta may change, but no stealth bouncy DD never really goes away.
---
Sorry to say end game gets stale fast as fuck with very slow content drops good luck 1 raid a year.
---
Taimis VA is well known / respected in other contexts (perhaps best known for Jimmy Neutron) so I too think it's the writing/directing and not the VA specifically.
---
To be fair, you drown on them in pve too.  I don't get how people run out so much, I have 650 and barely do pvp or wvw.
---
Another glowy gloves could be requiem gloves which is from lws4 in jahai bluffs
---
sure they could, noone does that though. even trainings arent all new players, theres always a few experienced people carrying the rest - thats my point
---
This change is honestly the final straw for me with GW2 PvE. I'm so fucking mad that they just outright removed shroud healing instead of just making it 2.5% in shroud so we could at least have SOME healing. As if reaper self-healing was anything to be concerned about anyways. Reaper is still completely non-meta in nearly every single raid encounter.
---
I'm seriously downloading a WoW private server client atm. I'm gonna be playing that until the official release. Fuck you Anet.
---
How will this work for support scrappers? I mean, if we don't do much striking damage because we focus on support wouldn't losing 300 vitality be bad by any standards?
---
The trade of is. Time to go back to HoT days and learn condi engi.
---
The name is borrowed from GW1, where the skill type existed for Rangers and behaved somewhat differently.  Preparations in GW1 were self-buffs that you needed to cast, and would get interrupted and cancelled if you were hit during the casting.  When the casting was complete, your attacks or movement would be buffed in a certain way for a certain duration.  Only one Preparation could be in effect at a time.
---
Apply Poison was an example of a Preparation, causing your physical attacks/attack skills to inflict Poison over its duration in addition to their normal effects.  Read the Wind was another, which boosted bow damage and caused your arrows to travel with twice the velocity.
---
Well, the original idea was that elite specs were to provide an alternate play style to classes, not be an outright improvement over them in every aspect. Unfortunately, they released elite specs with massive power creep and those you had to take them in 95% of all occasions. I personally think it’s a good idea to turn down the straight improvement that elite specs have over base classes, but it does suck that we’ve all already gotten used to their power and now it’s being stripped away.
---
Just when players are struggling to find reasons to stay in this game in its current state... they go and make that state of the game even worse hahahaha
---
I'll never understand that.  Hell, I'm not even done with ls3 stuff, much less ls4.

---
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt you get 10%+ more DPS if you have a support scourge that can give you constant barrier.  I wanted to not have a crutch with my build, though.  You can always swap runesets of you have a scourge in your party I guess.
---
The only problem is with getting hit, you might not have 100% barrier with a scourge since they apply big barrier less often, so if you get hit hard you're not guaranteed to have a reapplication right away, like you would with the runes.
---
No, it won't be.  Even with all the anti-stealth measures in WvW, if they added a stealth spec to the thief, players would be in arms.
---
Harsh but true. Once you settled in it's just the weekly raid grind and daily frac grind with added bullshit changes every few months.
---
Done phenomenally if so, no complaints here
---
&gt;before change
---
two keys used
---
&gt;after change
---
Ones who aren't the laziest people alive should deem this a non-issue 5 seconds after first misclick.
---
But on the other hand she ate him sooo he's kinda still with ya!
---
it's not good for the health of the game to do these absurd "reworks" when they can just tweak the numbers instead of destroying the "feel"/class identity/design.. they should buff core specs to bring them in line if that's the goal, not nerf stuff
---
good job on nitpicking the very few exceptions though!
---
so necro got nerfed indirectly because of scholar uptimes and it's mostly just a slap in the face to the WORST DPS SINCE THE GAME EXISTS EVER 7 YEARS THE WORST EVER BTW(maybe caps make you able to understand better somehow)
---
holo got it's rotation destroyed that's for sure..again one of the weakest specs got slapped for "being too strong" and locked out of toolbelts
---
mirage that has been dominating the pve condi boss fights? untouched! scourge that  has been dominating pvp for quite some time? untouched! but that pesky reaper that kinda healed in shroud was the problem
---
of course you like the changes you probably don't care nor understand balance and just see "oh new cool toys to play with" while people that invested time and effort into perfecting and mastering their builds(considered garbage by the meta in the case of holo and reaper) now can just suck it i guess cuz thief got a nice portal!
---
I'm down for some more Court stuff.  I still find myself liking them more than the Dreamers.
---
Im with you they were always a garunteed safe pick that had too much utility like tanking, giving quickness, alacrity, saving a whole raid from a wipe, or skipping mechanics. Mesmers bitch when they get one of their many tools taken and say theyre a dead class when theyre still good picks then downvote anyone who disagrees. Funny how most of the broken builds in the game were mesmer builds too.
---
Yeah, when she's given a proper line she's pretty good. She just has an unfortunate pandering character.
---
Now you feel exactly like necromancer users shortly after PoF, where scourge could be a dps while sacrificing all support. It was nerfed because of pvp/wvw. At least you could play holo for over a year with good enough results.
---
I like the small detail of the fashionwar guy having muscle definition in comparison to the two others.
---
Well Silverwastes has you moving around and farming. The idea there is to "tag" events, contributing to killing some mobs so you get credit when the event finishes. The idea is to tag as many as possible to get all their loot. So you'll be running around a lot!
---
PvP feels really accessible in this game. I think you might like it , particularly as Weaver as they tend to be duelists who can 1v1 people and get out if things get too rough.
---
I always considered mesmer closer to force blader, but ok, it has that annoying pet mechanic called illusions.
---
After this change? Reaper might not even have a tier.
---
All the other classes that use f5?  So your suggestion is to change it every time I swap classes.  Very annoying.
---
It also led to Reapers getting full heals in shroud in PvP and they can still heal themselves. Just. Not. In. Shroud.
---
Id honestly rather just pay real money for the skyscale lol. Id pay up to 30 dollars for a skyscale or griffon. Unfortunately, i just don't have time to play MMOs like that.
---
DH received only a minor overall buff if at all. DH burst has been nerfed with changes to Symbolic Avenger so we can't stack symbols anymore for greater burst, and in the opening the modifier is not immediate so opening burst is also nerfed.
---
Why? He brings more Twitch traffic than ArenaNet with their "Let's Play World Bosses"
---
See: His balance stream today versus ANET's
---
well,they suck at balancing and they making RETARDED changes to classes for no reason.
---
Not gonna waste my time having internet arguments when I can have fun playing the game, but I just had to comment on the 29k benchmark. Oh noooo 29k, how will they ever kill a raid bo--oh it's dead already. That's right. Because a class doesn't have to do 36k DPS to be in a good spot.
---
I used to play a full signet core guard back in the day.  
---
Certainly wasnt optimal, but it was definitely low maintenance which is what I needed back then.  
---
In pve this is cool, but I switched to a higher effort build and got some good results.  
---
The issue I see with signets are that they have either a weak activation effect, which means you'll rarely use them, or too long of a cooldown to justify losing the passive for an activation.  
---
I do use signet of courage tho, for that is the best sustain elite imo.
---
Contrary to popular opinion, I also think signet of resolve is worth it (especially if traited), because that is one powerful heal, while also being a low maintenance condi cleanse.  
---
If you wanna practice with more active skills, you could start by picking only your favorite signets and switching out one or two for a stunbreaker or condi cleanse to get that reactive/predictive mindset going.  
---
At the end of the day, if you're having fun with your own build, thats all that matters.
---
You can't do any of the interesting things with Chrono that made Chronomancer a good class. 
---
It's mostly a well dropping class now and it has access to alacrity. It still has good CC. 
---
However, distortion is pretty much dead on the class. You can't distort on command without self-shatter. You also can't shatter within a Time Shift since you likely won't get the clones up. The old "hit all my shatters within a time shift for boons" deal is gone. Maybe people thought that was powerful, but a Herald does the same thing with one button press, so clearly ANet doesn't have an issue with it. 
---
The spec is just functionally worse. It's now a slower, less dynamic, and more cumbersome spec. I never enjoyed mirage much so I'm taking a break from Mesmer.
---
*weeping tears of anguish cus Inhave to relearn chrono AGAIN*
---
You know what, screw this, im just gonna deal with it, i only play once in three months anyway for story mode...
---
Its not like I would want to enjoy PvE (read: fractals as a HoT chrono) content again or anything /s
---
Love the I want it now mentality. Let's not reward those who have been faithful throughout the years, to hell with them!
---
With the extra dll from arc dps you can swap f4 and f5 with chrono while keep unswapped with other char for example necro. Its quite sad, the game itself doesnt support this, instead, you need an extra dll of a 3pp tool.
---
This is the change, that makes me Ducking angry.
---
You're underestimating the power of muscle memory and how it can screw you over. (Yes, you could change the keybind, but then you'd have to change it back any time you played another class with F4 or F5 skills.)
---
And if that mess up keybinds for you other chars, arcdps have an option for character specific keybindsa.
---
That is like one WoW dungeon...and they release something like 4+ of those per expansion. Also, its not like the exotic and ascended were exclusive, most were just reskins of already existing skins.
---
I get that there are some in game rewards, but to say that this game has any significant amount of them is just kidding yourself.
---
God forbid anyone plays another class with an F5 skill.
---
Shield has a phantasm, and phantasms turn immediately into clones. Chrono also has multiple ways to revive shattered clones back to the field.
---
How many patches of only playing the game when there is a new story update because you hate all other classes but hate how chrono feels now compared to the good old HoT days; does that make now? 4? I havent played this game for a freaking year except for a few days when a patch hit...
---
If its season 5 makes sense give us a trailer next week then release the following. If its like season 3 and 4 they may even announce season 5 before the official trailer. If not season 5 then a four winds trailer with release the following week. Or maybe not a four winds trailer but a blog announcing it.
---
Regarding the prices: Nobody knows. But given the state of most common materials it cannot get worse if your goal is high value. 
---
The only moment common materials are spiking is if new things got implemented. And than the marked get's drowned in hoarded stocks again.
---
If there is no guild hall like feature or something with the same level of material consumption coming, than you are buying the tool for your entertainment / convienience and not for profit. If you want it for profit and you are absolutely not interested in the tool skin, than wait till the sellable version of the glyph rotates into the blc. Than you can get it for most likely around 100g. If you want direct profit get a glyph that A) gives actual something in addition and not simply a downgrade or upgrade of something you would get anyways or B) one that will improve your gathering rates (what is only profitable if you have hughly limited time per day or a boatload of characters).
---
Tried the holosmith changes, and oh my do they feel bad. The rifle rotation was fun, and alot simpler than it seemed on paper. It's been dumbed down and nerfed in cc/aoe/dps.
---
I really hope they have more changes in store because as a power holo enthusiast this is making me sad. I understand the need to balance for all gamemodes, even if mechanics change for the worse (anet only changes numbers, not mechanics). Holo needs something because right now it's tied to herald for being useless compared to all other power dps options.
---
Any numbers on how condi holo is faring now?
---
Honestly the best thing about stealth is the mind games and target break. You can make an enemy waste a bunch of AOE if in you cloak and dagger then immediately roll away.
---
In terms of survivability and escape it's actually pretty bad due to the high up cost. Yeah you can heal in stealth, but so can the enemy.
---
They replaced thief traps, which were nearly all complete garbage, with new skills called Preparations with updated effects.
---
They're all great and the feeling of having three actually useful utility skills on my bar at once as a thief is complete surreal.
---
The Golden Wing Shield from Caudecus' Manor explorable dungeon would go good with that look...
---

---
To be fair, lots of builds have historically been worse than banner warrior, warrior has been broken overall for a long time prior to the extend berserk mode update pretty much, but holo wasn’t even close to top dps and that’s the main point, meanwhile dgh and ren get buffed
---
Watch LN bench
---
Both are stale and neglected with declining populations.
---
Chrono's rotation hasn't really changed much (if at all).
---
Remember that mirage evades don't cover any distance. Even with the speed boost, they still aren't as good at getting out of AoE's or away from enemies. That's a deliberate tradeoff. This was even more noticeable when it first came out.
---
thanks to everyone for the suggestions.
---
this is also why i kind of wish there were some 10 point challenges in the main maps.
---
Im still stuck in the days of not having to worry about pugs not standing in your wells cus SoI does the job well enough... in fact i even miss the days of distortion on precog well
---
Everyone talks about how if you enter shroud below 90% (somehow when you have passive 5% lifesteal and a huge ass health pool but okay), but nobody talks about how if you enter above 90% it locks your scholar bonus in. But okay anet hates necro terrible class yep.
---
Purity of Purpose.
---
Im going to say no entirely. A year content drought is not good for any game. Destiny 1 kingsfall is all im gonna say
---
it IS a tradeoff, I said as much. They got mirrors and ambushes as new mechanics to compensate.
---
Good point sir
---
Thanks guys
---
I'll look into that
---
It feels like a competition between chrono and druid to see which one gets the most twisted and annoying nerfs every single balance patch. At this point they could just delete both specializations and end with this agony.
---
&gt; Maybe people thought that was powerful, but a Herald does the same thing with one button press, so clearly ANet doesn't have an issue with it. 
---
Don't be obtuse, Herald doesn't pump party wide quickness alacrity
---
Yeah I don't get this nerf. Mirage is dominating the condi spec and is untouched. Condi rev was only good on certain fights and now it's utterly useless.
---
&gt;Djinn's Dominion: Some line-of-sight obstacles have been added around the map's midpoint. Djinn's Dominion is no longer in beta status.
---
Does this mean it's in Ranked, or is it still only in Unranked (just not an option to pick every time) like Spirit Watch?
---
I was talking about self-boons. Rev puts out party wide boons, including alacrity, but those are different skills from their F2 boon skill.
---
Tl;Dr, each profession gets two elite specs which each give access to a new trait line, a new weapon, and 5 new utility skills, along with some changes to class mechanic
---
Ranger for example gets a druid and soulbeast. The first gives you a staff, enhanced healing and support and let's you access to an F5 which swaps you into a transformed healing mode. The second gives you a main hand dagger and the ability to merge with your pet for increased stats
---
There are some nice ideas in the rework of SA, but overall the usefullness is very lacking. I like the implementation of various life stealing procs, but the numbers are far too low to actually matter. You neither gain any damage nor survivability boost through these. The spidervenom build up in stealth is also a nice idea, but way too slow. The healing traits are an outright fail IMO. Nobody needs that. Really. Shadow Arts is not a healing support traitline and never will be, because thief never will incorporate the tools for that. It's just a stupid idea. Those trait slots have been wasted.
---
&gt;I think Marionette will go down as the most satisfying victory I have ever had in the open world.
---
There is none.
---
my friend was still parsing about 30.8 and he's usually about .5 off the SC numbers, so the holo bench will likely still be 31k.
---
But you're right the nerfs weren't really necessary or called for
---
Where is this Bough of the Grove chair?  My sylvari must have it!!
---
Care to send a log?, nobody on SC's public discord has gotten remotely near that number yet.
---
let me ask him and see if he has one
---
Wait, where did we lose reveal?
---
Has anyone run numbers on condi holi yet? I imagine it's down too but not by as much.
---
Rip, figured out through looking at the log he was using three too many conditions by mistake, so modified ammunition was giving him more dps than it should have.  He stopped using it and fell back to about 29k, like you mentioned.  Sorry to get your hopes up :/ dreams crushed
---
Losing out on the expertise is a big hit to Condi classes in PvE. Even without any crafting, you can still get some Vipers gear. 
---
[Consider this wiki article on gearing your character.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Viper_armor) 
---
If we're talking strictly TP gear, then I'd lean towards Rabid. Scourge benefits from critical chance, even as Condi. 
---
Maybe Carrion, Rampager, or Dire. Apothecary for more barrier.
---
It actually did stack at one point, but that was unintentional and skyrocketed guardians to stupid dps levels before it was hotfixed.
---
Perhaps, but I haven’t had a chance to try out the changes (out of town) and I don’t main Holo so I can’t say what all the effects this change has had. I’m not even sure how long overheating lasts or how to get around that to continue using the kitless build.
---
Fucking chairs....
---
Sword/Dagger is  the most popular choice.
---
You have a lot of mobility i form of Teleporting and a lot of evades but my Personal favorite is Dagger/Pistol on Daredevil. Your evades are also you mobility in fights and you gain access to stealth.
---
Overall i would say, if you are new you should start with [Sword/Dagger on core thief](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Power_S/D_Roamer).
---
It was so easy now for me to stop thinking of re-gearing my scourge into reaper for fractals! Ty Arenanet!
---
Yeah I was thinking it was something of the sort.
---
All power DPS variants of Holo are pretty dead
---
# BEEN HERE ALL ALONG
---
Interesting. Mostly for zergs?
---
No. Its different armor class mate, only chronos use diviners on light armor classes.
---
Nice!
---
okay those are slick
---
well I have foefire gloves and shoulders
---
They've found 3+ year old Reddit posts where people were frothing at their mouth screaming "elite specs should not give more DPS and should only change playstyle/flavor" :) 
---
Meanwhile condi Weaver with earth shield auto-attacking now reached 30k DPS :)
---
Yeah no shit, so use Trinkets and weapons elsewhere.
---
Also its not like Chronos would cease to function as supports.
---
Download arc dps with the thing for profession specific keybinds.
---
A easy way to get transmutation charges through pve is to mapcomplete the racial cities and Lions Arch. They will give you one transmutation charge for each and you can mapcomplete on more then one character. 
---
If you got the expansion then you also get daily log in rewards and will get a few transmutation charges every now and then. But tbh it is only in the beginning that you lack of them. I have more then i can ever use just by playing the game. They are rewarded at many spots and events and festivals so just have a look out of it. 
---
Also i would not use charges whilst leveling. You will swap gear every other level anyway. But in the gemstore there are outfits, maybe one of them is something you like. They will cover up your armor and you can have them on any character you want. They cost gems ofc but it is always nice to have at least one outfit if you like me do not like the leveling armor.
---
That happens a lot the last weeks. Dunno what patch it came with. You also will hoover over the ground when you jump off your mount after that. And have your arms straight out. Looking totally dumb.
---
Most wvw chronos are switching to new classes because of the update, as the new changes make it hard to be useful in a zerg, and also much harder to mitigate damage when trying to get away from said zerg.   
---
I was already being frequently asked to switch to another class for support as they can do it better (and am currently maining an ele healer). Until the class gets another overhaul (it will), this is imo your best bet for being useful to your guild. Don't try to force a spec that the devs very clearly are aiming at PvE.
---
so triggered
---
Why are you playing an MMO as a solo player?
---
Predatory as fuck to just shit all over your previous specializations to make new ones more appealing. Holo got a huge nerf, Reaper got a huge nerf cloaked as a "bug fix" when its been there for eons, Chrono got guttered. Like...?
---
I didn't make a passive aggresive benchmark video of base necro though, can't compare with you.
---
lolwut
---
Condi Rene didn't get a nerf. It's a dps gain. It's not "utterly useless" on any of the bosses it was good at before.
---
Coming soon to a Lootbox near you!
---
Unfortunately there are no good condi-prefix gear you can buy from the TP. The best is obviously Viper's, and after that you have Sinister and Grieving, and how effective those would be depends on how much access to +condi duration you have. After that is probably Trailblazer's, though that's pretty tanky as condi gear goes. And after ALL THAT are things like Rabid, Rampager's, Shaman's, etc...
---
If you need any more evidence about how anet do not listen, this patch is it. What is the point of publishing  balance changes in advance if they are not going to take any notice of feedback. It just becomes an exercise in appearing to communicate without really doing it. This patch will make WvW ridiculous with group stealth not having an effective counter. Not to mention silly changes like chrono completely losing what makes it unique.
---
You must be sorting it wrong? Check New rather then anything else and you should get tons of new posts.
---
How ever as of the last months there are mostly people ranting so i can get that it does not give you much information at this point.
---
do you know how much is power rev/herald benching to say for sure its solidly worst dps class?
---
Chronos haven't been viable in WvW for a while, and these changes make it much worse.
---
Exactly this. Bump the rewards or the challenge. Make it worth my time in reward or entertainment, or both.
---
It's honestly kinda sad how easy the world bosses became with the bonuses they added. These bosses are only somewhat challenging if your map has very few players which is silly; the boss should scale so it remains challenging no matter what
---
I think they will fix holo a bit in the future but we will see. Not really a fan of it anyways, kinda clunky and weird for me. Scrapper is cool now tho.
---
But that way you have scrapper who's tanky by default instead of scrapper who's tanky while doing something. Sounds like a good tradeoff to me.
---
Doesnt berserker also lose toughness with minor trait instead of major?
---
Yeah, it's pretty clear the portal uses Scourge effects, recoloured and without the spirit/skeletons etc, but it still looks really good.
---
It has been many months since that soi nerf. You can let go of your envy of Chrono's past poparity.
---
Nope and reaper was not OP as well. Anet making stupid changes presumably because some irrelevant metric tells them so.
---
Trivially easy things can be entertaining. But autoattacking world bosses isn't.
---
Not rly,just different.
---
How do you even play burst chrono in pvp and wvw with this patch? I tried it and it just feels so weak compared to mirage power shatter or even vanilla that it's not worth playing. 
---
Let's say I use the normal mesmer burst rotation and open with gs2. I do get a clone if I hit successfully, but I can't use f1 and f5 together like before because  as soon as you shatter one you lose access to f5 or f1. So the normal rotation of going in hitting and back to original place does not work anymore. Even for using CS for other skills the dependency on generating a clone first just does not work.
---
Now you can only daze and shatter f1 with mantra of distraction and then f1 because f3 will lose clones if you have any and then f1 won't work whereas you can easily f3 and f1 on vanilla mesmer or as a mirage. 
---
I know you're trying to give positivity but this is just too weak.
---
For what its worth condi holo is still alright.
---
That they really destroyed here is the kitless noobfriendly build. 
---
Now holo needs kits more than ever.
---
Why did you stop playing? It might be the case that the reason you stopped is because of something that is still present in the game, regardless of expansions. But at the end of the day, GW2 will be free to play for you, even if it's just the core right now, so you lose nothing except a little bit of time by jumping back in and having a look around.
---
HMMMM it's like they did exactly the same thing with another class in a previous patch with the same goals ....
---
Yeah I managed to do that today, I dunno what level is the best to determine "Trying" them but I didn't have the game installed and was mainly unsure what classes there were that specialized in pets and if they were good or not.
---
Do you happen to have any screenshots of it?
---
