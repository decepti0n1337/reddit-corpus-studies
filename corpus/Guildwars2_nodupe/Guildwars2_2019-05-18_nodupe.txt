Blah blah blah blah blah.  Some's salty.  Whine much?
---
---
---
&gt; But you have not got the skyscale after 1 hour , so everything sucks right?
---

---
Strawman, how about debating honestly.
---
That gave me chills. We usually think of the dragon minions as mindless monsters, but they're still conscious inside their warped bodies! And they can't control themselves!
---
I'm not saying the collection is good lol, going around the map 3 times in a row was obviously retarded padding.
---
I'm just that the timegate itself is not grind, you can have grind, timegating or both, the collection has both.
---
Iirc they changed it so LS maps no longer give keys to sub level 80s on completion
---
It is "hard" in the sense that it is going to take several more days just to unlock. The beetle was "easy" in the sense that it didn't take long to unlock.
---
It's from the original mount pack.  My guess is that we'll see it towards the end of August if they do an anniversary sale.
---
cry and start gathering materials to make one
---
&gt;And it's not just waiting around fiddling with your thumbs waiting for the timewall to go down. You have to go around maps finish collection, go do stuff, wait for stuff, wait for more stuff, and the rest to be determined.
---
After you've done the collection you're forced to wait the timewall is my issue. I can tolerate grind if its at my own pace.
---
&gt;People compare it to legendary grind for a reason.
---
You can craft legendaries in a day though. People had exordium before the daily reset.
---
Didnt do many thing on the map but for the few i did realize that anet did a mix of very good things in previous maps. This maps feel prety good mixing things like navigation map feel a bit like TD, event rotations like SW, meta boss mixing SW-VW, AB-TARIR, SW extra champs. Loot chests a bit like istan and SW. Even puting masterys in map from other maps feel good to, like jump muchrums, the spider webs, lava tunels of ember bay, and even the WP during meta like other map. In the end mostra things feel good mixed.
---
I'd kill for a horde mode where you get to unleash your everything on endless mobs.

Gw2 ripping off warframe's arbitrationsm with solo/coop endless survival/objective missions that with steadily increasing difficulty and rewards that reward you the longer you last before dying/number of objectives you can complete before dying would be great.
---
In terms of GW2: Living Story ascended trinkets, Knight of the Thorn cheap ascended weapon, overall ways to easily earn high/highest tier equipment is a catch up mechanic for new players to get into raiding/fractals. Reintroducing Queens Jubilee festival and readding retired achievements was a way to catch up with achievements points for new achievement hunters. Introducing LS4 currency vendor in Dragonfall is easy way for people to catchup with currency-gated features of earlier LS4 achievements/content.
---
Just for example, but there is quite a few other.

Enter the [PvP lobby](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mists), your character gets boosted to level 80 while there (so you can use any level character), you can use the menu at the top to select PvP build, amulet (PvP amulet controls all stats, stats on gear don't matter, can be in all whites and it's fine), and runes/sigils. Base thief is fine in PvP, should also be mentioned though that just because deadeye *can* use rifle doesn't mean they have to. [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest) has some suggested PvP builds that you can consider. Feel free to practice or try characters/builds in the PvP lobby as all skills and traits that you have access to are unlocked. There are also [guides you can read on metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guides#PvP).

I am in super love with Exordium...but I feel like the footfalls are super short compared to every other foot fall....they disappear after 2-3 steps while weapons like Xiquatl disappear after 6-7
---
You can do all of the toys and treats at once, the only real timegate is the food.
---
Funyons?!

It's already great as it is, thank you very much.

I really miss Dulfy. The GW2 wiki's "guides" are nowhere near good enough (those pierced together screenshot showing a rotated minimap are far from being useful).
---
My math also assumes that the ocean there is only 50m deep and that Kralk + the map consist of sand and stone in a 30/70 rate. Both are guessed and probably the ocean is deeper and the land mass + Kralk are heavier than sand and stone. 
---
Ofcourse my math isn't accurate, but it doesn't have to be. Since we don't know too many factors, it doesn't matter if some values are inaccurate. 
---
This calculation only shows a very rough result. We know that it's inaccurate, but we also know, that it actually doesn't have to be accurate. With this big mass and this power we have here, the result wouldn't change much, even if they fall with 600 instead of 700 km/h or if the land mass is 10 million tons lighter. 
---
Sure it does change things, but the different isn't important. It wouldn't chang a result like "the wave floods big parts of Orr, hit the Sandswept Isles and brings water to the Desolation". 
---
It would be a difference like "the wave floods 5% less of Orr" but that's it.
---
Just your average every day run of the mill "probable serial killer who decided they needed to share their creepy murder fantasy with the general public instead of keeping it under wraps" post.
---
700 km/h is 434.96 mph
---
Bakaroo ora a roo
---
I disagree, since that was most of the content for the first 3.5 years when the game was doing it's best. HoT killed the forward momentum of the game is a very serious way. Why do you think POF was the anti-HoT. Doing what brings you to the party isn't dangerous. You might stop playing but after HoT launched, lots of people stopped. Not all of them have come back.
---
Once more, the servers are dealing with massive stutters due to people rushing for the next collection in one place. How could they NOT have foreseen this? I just want to do my story, fuck's sake.
---
I think I know what you’re talking about during a recent guild mission on this map I could see the shattered just standing in the sky box looks super bugged I figured it was just the guild mission but might be a map bug
---
ya cant cuz you have to keep pressing forward
---
I haven't logged on for the patch yet because I haven't been feeling the new maps the way I enjoyed things like Silverwastes or Auric Basin.  You just made me open the launcher and start the update.
---
And actually it was 706 km/h or to be more accurate 706,7988km/h -&gt; 196,333 m/s. I just used easy numbers.
---
Like I said, that are details and wouldn't affect the result in an important way.
---
Well GW2 survived HoT but the context is different now. Oldschool Runescape became a thing, Classic WoW comes out in 3 months, Ashes of Creation releases like in a year or two alongside with some amazing MMOs like New World or Crowfall. Its no longer just WoW and ESO.
---
Power Berserker uses GS. Druid can use GS and Staff in the same fight if you're oil kiting on Deimos
---
Exactly. That's dumb and so transparent. Again, if she was a straight character talking about her boyfriend all the time this dude would probably have ZERO issues with it.
---
Someone should work with everyone to make a compilation of the best npc dialog moments.

Speak for yourself.

&gt;there was tyria 3d which allowed you to explore the maps in browser, you could prolly do the same in a game engine
---
Oh interesting! Looks like it was still being maintained by a newer developer [about a year ago](https://github.com/njibhu/Tyria3DApp). Wonder if they need any help adding the new map...
---
Thanks for responding. Figures that the first detailed text post post I do in a long time doesn't get hardly any attention. Oh well, I did choose a bad time to post this, given the new episode just having been released
---
The first time I noticed it was with Ember Bay since the background is pretty much completely red. Most maps  show more neutral colors making the difference less noticeable.

Oh sure because it's going to make suck a difference if they log in for a few hours to get something done and then get bored or log in for 15 minutes a day to do something mind mindnumbing and then log off because they are bored and can't do anything else with it.
---
Mean anything to you?  Lol...gibberish to me.
---
But anet is pumping more gemstore items then ever tho, they have been nerfing every decent gold income source in the game and gems are also expensive as fuck. Also mount skins are the golden goose they didnt have before.
---
Meteorlogicus was my first ledgy but I actually hate the day/night cycle for my fashion wars :(
---
Third-worlders like yourself may not value your time, but us Americans do.
---
Burnout prevention
---
False. In fact, there are tons of glider wings coming out constantly. And there are more armor sets and weapons coming out in game now than then, by a long shot. Do you know what confirmation bias is? One of the big complaints about HoT is how few armor sets there were comparatively. We've gotten more armor sets and weapons in game since PoF....again addressing the complaints of HoT.
---
Anyway, you can believe anything you want, but if raiding was as popular as you think it is, it would be supported more. There's no reason not to support it if it's popular. It's not being supported because fewer people do it.  What other explanation is there?
---
People were complaining about not receiving xp for spirit shards while progressing through the sky scale achievement, but I don’t understand how because I don’t even get any xp / or progress towards anything on my bar. What do I have to do to be eligible for experience towards spirit shards? Is there something I’m missing, or am I completely mistaken?
---
it's on sale now
---
I never said raiding was more popular than open world or story. My point was if every end game mode dies then the game loses it's purpose and has no future. You cant have an mmo just for its story aspects, it wouldnt be profitable enough.
---
That 's super strange. Cause I remember it being hidden. Now I can fully admit I may be mistaken. But several other posters have assured that ,this exact situation happened with roller beetle. That it was visible and locked , but then patched to be hidden. Very strange.
---
All the feelings in this thread, and i'm here skipping every cutscene not giving a fuck about the story and having no idea what's going on.
---
Fall further behind on what, exactly? The use of skyskales outside of Dragonfall is a novelty as best, and whether you get your skyscale next week or in two months, there wont be any content where you would be at a heavy disadvantage for not having a skyscale yet
---
region* with exception for few ls maps
---
The Griffon can also maintain level flight indefinitely by chaining dives unlike the Skyscale which loses stamina in level flight.
---
Why would meteorlogicus specifically get the special update to a tier 2 legendary...?
---
If you win you get them 100%
---
If you lose you get them from reward track.
---
Would be odd considering it’s still a PoF raid
---
For Skyscale Treats, as the items drop from Champions, does that mean all from bounty? I'm not very clear about this one.
---
End game before HoT was PvP, WvW, fractals and dungeons that weren't just a roflstomp due to powercreep. I don't agree with collections being end game - it's like saying questing in WoW is endgame. And evetually you'll run out of legendaries to craft or will get burned out because of gold farm or because you will have to force yourself to get gift of exploration for 15th time. Sorry but I don't believe that an MMORPG that doesn't require you need to invest yourself into can survive. You can find many examples of games dying because they couldn't engage the player enough.
---
They drop from normal variants too, veterans and above just have higher drop chances.
---
aaaaaaaaaaand the name is gone
---
The new arc is freezing my screen every 30-60sec. Without i dont have problems. But as soon as I use arc my game is freezing all the time. Also friends of mine are having DCs because of the new Arc. Looks like it is still buggy after the recent patch.
---
The game is being played on a pc, it's just streaming to the person's ipad.  it's not running on it.
---
Necro scepter is a hitscan weapon. Obviously it won’t have projectiles.
---
The raiding community is probably the smallest part of this game I'm afraid.
---
That's just it. Questing in WoW is NOT end game. Because the only way to get BIS gear in WOW is to raid.  But here there are multiple paths to BIS gear. Raiding is not the defacto end game here. WoW's greatest crime to MMO space was convincing the public that there was one type of end game, and nothing else. Old school MMO players will tell you differently. WoW highjacked this industry due to it's success. It should inform people that no one has ever been able to duplicate that success, because the success has not been based on a raiding end game. There are other end games for other types of players and your dismissal of us is one of the reasons we're so down on raiding.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
if you look at efficiency, you can see that this currency is actually positioned between racing medallions and mistborn keys
---
That’sThe Shatterer. It’s waaaaay smaller than Kralkatorrik and the head is super different. 
---
The Shatterer is a world boss that you can fight in Blazeridge Steppes 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Shatterer
---
just mention this has been a thing since gw1, though there is more of a regional background, rather than individual maps. but it IS a cool/subtle bit of eye candy
---
I think the problem is that time and time again they have no trust in their product what so ever so they come up with this shit to force people to stay
---
I'm pretty sure there are more turnes down by this shit and wont bother to get it, that would otherwise just so it in the long run. Ita a lot off collections already on their own it doesnt need this shit
---
I gained faith after the lay off of a more focused ANet, and this just killed it straigth away
---
Gorrik is finding a place to hatch the eggs. Go do this other thing. Come back to new place Gorrik has found to hatch the eggs while you've been away.
---
When you use warhorn skills, Howler is supposed to create a howling wolf head out of mist in front of the horn when it's blown.
---
Nah real life made a Sirens call she couldn't ignore *She is in good health btw dont worry*
---
Does your second account have a gathering tool that gets extra harvests?  I believe some of the gathering tools let you harvest more out of a node per action, which can make it seem like you're getting less if you're not paying attention.
---
If you're using default gathering tools on all your accounts, then that won't be it.
---
Ok thanks for the quick reply
---
I finished the eggs yesterday and didn't get a message from Gorrik today. With the time gate, I can't do anything on this tomorrow, which is the day I actually have time to play and work on giant collections. 
---
Glitches and timegates and endless frustration with this thing.
---

---
Here's the difference with 947% mf before the patch to what you get now.
---
Have faith, little fella'. And courage. Fight the ~~undead~~ pessimism with us. We could use your help.
---
Howler has a draw effect (a blast of water around you that splashes the ground and creates a mist around you), a very subtle foot step, the sfw of a wolf howl when you use skills (and constantly during night), a day/night cycle, and it's supposed to create a howling wolf head out of mist every time you use a warhorn skill. That last bit has been broken for awhile.
---
Can you buy me a bifrost 😭 2.5k gold
---
Das what I'm saying! There's even a pretty good example in game with Logan!
---
Erg, it’s getting really difficult to not just make this thing already...
---
For me, I use invisible bags to hold gear that I don't want to be accidentally sold at a merchant. The gear in those bags never leaves it and I have just enough space for what I need out of them. I find sorted bags in general to be incredibly annoying because of the way I sort my inventory. My inventory management is generally salvage all -&gt; deposit materials -&gt; compact. It keeps my inventory nice and tidy, I don't have to worry about random stuff all over the place whenever I open it. I find the sorted bags to be incredibly inconvenient for the way I play the game.
---
When the score is tied, the match can go into overtime. First team to get ahead in the score wins.
---
The unbound magic tools harvest 4 items per interaction, so you're getting the same number of items, but with fewer interactions with the synthesizer. 10 items means only 3 interactions when using the unbound skins vs 4 for other skins. To verify this, try transmuting your unbound harvesting tools to another skin temporarily.
---
Long term, they will devalue, yes.  But given the recipes that have been mined/possibly leaked and passed around in discord... the various mats for crafting the legendary runes/sigils will prop the prices up for a significant time anyway.
---
Wing 1-5 actually have a lot of lore. Fighting against the second highest ranked white mantle member who managed to harvest the power of the bloodstone stalls time for Lazarus to be revived is better than any lw3 episode.
---
I find it very useful.
---
It’s great, but maybe to make sure it keeps longevity, should they add a daily unique reward to completing it like amalgamated gemstone or mystic coin or something? A rare sought after item or something new and valuable entirely?
---
&gt; Anet, fortunately for me and players like me, is probably seeing things more my way, which is why you're so disenfranchised. I, on the other hand, am not.
---
Well, that was uneccessary. I'm not disenfranchised, really, because if anet wont change their policy I have multiple titles I can go and play, you on the other hand, are very limited in this field. And when ANet will pull the content plug out from open world (and they already said they kinda will with no new map releases every LS) then you're kinda screwed, and I'm not.
---
Anyway I agree, we won't come up together to any agreement.
---
Will you find it useful even after legendary runes and sigils?
---
Copy them, and then control+v to paste once in game.  Keyboard shortcuts are life.
---
Or not ask for a 22 day time gate?
---
Oh, I wasn't aware of any details of what goes into it?  Can you elaborate?
---
I have a White Revenant Charr that got wounded during service so much that his blood tainted his coat of fur turning most of it Red and even the hair, and he ended up blind, being unable to be of service, he joined the force as a Charr "Tribunal" Chairman (Judge).
---
It is a really good map. I enjoy the map. 
---
I just hate the collection.
---
Trying to trivialize my end game is what is unnecessary here. You're seeing me as the aggressor. I'm not. People who think they hold a monopoly on what end game should be are the issue. I acknowledge there needs to be more raids for that crowd.  I said it earlier in this posting. I'm not saying you can't make raiding YOUR end game. I'm simply saying there is room for more people to have different end games, and that there are enough of us out here who don't raid or PvP that you could build an entire game around us.
---
One dev that left Lotro said only 10% of the population of that game EVER raided or Pvped since launch..but they accounted for 50% of all forum posts. That should be food for thought for you.
---
It literally feels like a more fun/engaging &amp; better looking version of Silverwastes, i'm certain you'll love it!
---
Not to mention it utilizes a mixture of almost **every** mastery we've unlocked so far (including both HoT &amp; PoF)... Ley-Lines, Updrafts, Mushrooms, Lavas, you name it!
---
That. Is. Amazing.
---
Dragon's mask (gem store), glorious brigandine, drover's gloves, Elonian leggings and boots, scaled dragon wings backpack. The glider uses apricot and deep teal.
---
Dyes are a mixture of apricot, orange spring, chest uses buttercream.
---
There aren’t a ton of legendaries.. I don’t see why they couldn’t give some of the older ones an update. Would create excitement for some of the older lesser used ones! There is never a time a dev shouldn’t look at older content that isn’t working and find a way to improve it.
---
Dragon's Mask from the gem store.
---
MvP @Op.thx
---
QQ No. I don't own a single legendary.
---
&gt;  A rare sought after item or something new and valuable entirely? 
---
For what it's worth, they did add the new armor set &amp; the new ascended weapons, which is more then we can say for most other metas.
---
On average, it's also very profitable for gold farming! 
---
If Silverwastes has survived the test of time for this long, due to efficiency, i have a feeling Dragonfall will too.
---
Dude buy one. You have gold. Da fuck lmao
---
Well NOW there is.
---
seriously, what makes them think they can tell me how to play the game. i want to complete the collection at my own pace. I don't have all the time to finish these each day.
---
It was the Lotro forums I'm talking about. Lotro is Lord of the Rings online. For years devs have been saying you ignore the casual audience at your own peril. This isn't something that's new, or not widely known and discussed. I'm not even sure what the argument is. 
---
Very few games ever try to cater to only casual players, so of course none of them service. Most hard core games haven't done well either, so what does that prove?
---
It's 3k gold on the TP. Clearly some people find it useful.
---
What are you talking about tho, I never said developer should ignore anyone. I'm saying the opposite, just in out context that is GW2, the ignored ones are not casuals but veterans. 
---
&gt; Most hard core games haven't done well either, so what does that prove?
---
I'd say Classic WoW was in hardcore territory and its not the biggest mmo on the market. Have you seen WoW twitch numbers lately? Its consistently on the top just because classic beta - over 100k people were watching asmongold doing lv 18 dungeon 2 days ago.
---
It's truly unlike anything s4 has given us so far. Easily top in the top 5 metas
---
I just put it in my guild bank, closed the window, opened it, withdrew it, and it worked for me without crafting a new one. Just for general FYI
---
What are you talking about tho, I never said developers should ignore anyone. I'm saying the opposite, just in our context that is GW2, the ignored ones are not casuals but veterans. 
---
You can always buy me a new character slot
---
but then I'll have less gold... and I may need gold for something else...
---
This is what I don't understand. The time gate isn't intended for you to "work for something", it's intended to pace the content. It's doing that rather well. 
---
It's a flying mount, the only other one had a money gate. Both are valid methods to gate, and I'll take the time one every day of the week.
---
Everyone who is complaining about this sounds ridiculous and spoiled. ANet has no obligation to give you what you want. If they want to keep the map populated for longer than a few days, this may be one of their ways to do that. Tough shit. 
---
Bring the downvotes you whiners.
---
Thank you so much for the write up! Love hearing about the process, makes me want to craft it even more! Have a lovely day and please keep being so creative with these weapons/designs in general.
---
Probably ended up crowded /confused
---
Doubt anyone going to see this but whatever. I'm still on the skyscales "SCALES" part as it's monotonous and too long. Why 21? WHY THAT NUMBER? why even am I collecting medicine and scales? That entire part could have been left out.
---
The collection should have been something simple along the lines like;
---
Get the Egg
---
Hatch the egg
---
Raise the hatchling
---
Train your Dragon.
---
I mostly like to WW and the mount for that was only 7 things to make easy for those that DO NOT LIKE WW ( that time they remove WW from WC/MC because it was too hard and unfair for those on weak servers).
---
Now I don't PVE often and when I do it's to things with my guilds.
---
The collections for skyscale needs to be reduce to for those that prefer to WW or PVP.
---
Also that WW is pointless and useless.

Where are these leaks you speak of?

Sounds like you're just nitpicking everything I'm saying at this point and arguing semantics about grinding just like you were nitpicking my wording earlier about older players. As said, I don't like the timewall and I don't like the grind. My point is they're pushing away newer &amp; casual players like me. You're saying you're fine with the grind but don't like the timewall. Why accept and participate in collections when it encourages Arenanet to add timewalls? If they see the players will go do the grind anyway as if it's actual "content" then they'll keep heading in that direction. It alienates the rest of us that don't want any of it, and I don't see how it gets Arenanet any money at the end of the day by alienating a part of their community. You guys jumping on the rest of us protesting about the grind &amp; timewalls are not helping.
---
I'd like to believe they just forgot to put one, so far only warrior gs 5 doesn't have anything special to it
---
 Meteorlogicus is fine in my opinion.
---
If anything, what needs love is the Claw of the Khan-Ur, and Gen 2 torch, which is so unpopular I don't even know its name.
---
So you agree with me, the timewall is dumb and the skyscale didn't have to be released in this way? Sounds like you're just nitpicking everything I'm saying at this point and arguing semantics about 'grinding' just like you were nitpicking my wording earlier about older players. Looks like your other comment shows you saying it's a grind anyway not just a timewall. As said, I don't like the timewall and I don't like the grind. My point is they're pushing away newer &amp; casual players like me. Why accept and participate in collections when it encourages Arenanet to add timewalls?

---
does it get bigger each day? or only upon completion of certain parts
---
*[screams internally after reading OP]*
---
You're telling me people grinded exordium in one day from scratch and that it is comparable to the topic, which is the Skyscale mount? OK dude. Exordium is a usable gear type with stats btw. Skyscale is a mount. Sounds like you agree with me about the timewall. Why are you nitpicking my words then? You go and say  
---
\&gt;  It's the wording with what you said. The collection isn't really grindy, its just timegated, unless you consider waiting around fiddling with your thumbs "grind".    
---
And then you also say later that it's a "grind"  
---
\&gt;  I'm not saying the collection is good lol, going around the map 3 times in a row was obviously retarded padding. I'm just that the timegate itself is not grind in of itself. You can have grind, timegating or both, the collection has both. I can tolerate the grind, but not the timegate.  
---
We're not arguing about anything at all.  And it's not my English or wording at all, either. Seems like you have cognitive dissonance on whether you should be getting Skyscale or not. Just go play and enjoy the collections if you want, there's no need for you to go to forums online and jump on players like me who do not want to participate in time wall grinds. Everyone that participates in this Skyscale collecting is telling Arenanet it's okay to have items locked behind grinding collections and timewalls. They'll look at the stats and see later how many % of players got the mount, and their bean counters will go look how much $$$ money they made from this type of content - selling microtransactions on the mount skins and related content to the episode. They'll see whether creating this type of content was good enough for the playerbase or whether we should get more repeatable content. They'll see whether or not people are cashing in gems for gold to get the lamp things for the collection. Alienating a segment of their playerbase that don't want to get the skyscale might not make an impact to their bottom line at all, who knows until their quarterly reports come out? But it's definitely impacting a portion of their playerbase.  
---
Personally, I'm venting all my frustrations here because Anet does look at reddit here and there, and I hope they consider fixing this. If not, no big deal, I enjoy the free story update and then I'll move along. I won't be spending money on mount skins which I constantly get from GW2, so really it's saving me money.
---
Try using the authenticator
---
LoL you got better FPS than my PC does... :)
---
I just want to be able to dive like the Griffin. Going down on the skyscale is painful.
---
Mm.. yea.  Glad i saw this before beginning to craft twilight.
---
For the record, depositing and withdrawing from guild bank worked to trigger the collection for me. I didn't have to craft another one.
---
I think they should link after episode five to the Requiem story bits.
---
Put RNG in there as well, their dynasty lasted 3/4 years before they fell apart at worlds.  SKT are simply not complacent.
---
I'm gonna go with no.
---
Is Dragonfall's Meta more profitable than Silverwastes?  I feel like I'm missing something if so.  I farm the meta, do extra side events for keys, do the final event push, then do boss rush after but it never feels like I'm getting as much coin as silverwastes farm. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Griffon gang "WeirdChamp"ing the skysquad.
---
&gt;Now it's done.
---
I bet it isn't.
---
Given, the final encounter is visually very epic, although to me it has also always been a bore to me mechanically wise, since most of what you just have to do is wait around on isles, since the zerg got so big, and the threat so small that it lost its sense of urgency compared to the previous tree stage.
---
It feels less so in this final encouter
---
The mercury trail from Jugg is actually pretty cool on my Scrapper... Using the auto attack chain or 3 is quite satisfying.
---
Not unique to mining, it does that when you activate a signet too.
---
right now? every time there is something that you have to work for really.
---
when it is a rare drop: I don't want to have to rely on RNGesus, why is it not a collection?
---
when it is a collection: It takes too long, why is it not a rare drop that is account bound or you can buy it somewhere?
---
When you need ingredients: It is so damn expensive why is it not a rare drop or a collection?
---
The same procedure as last time...
---
if you've seen the lab he set up; that's not a _brb in a minute_ kinda thing.
---
but hey! magic's a thing in this world so maybe it is.
---
ah well that explains it then, thank you for your knowledge,i wouldnt have known that. I will try all characters on standard tools to double check
---
Since I am a mesmer main I ca  tell you this:
---
I did world completion as a berserker/marauder mirage with sw/sw + gs and it was easy
---
Chronos (built as dps) are pretty strong at the moment, works pretty well for every open world content and is generally pretty versatile through blinks, portals
---
Chrono (built as power support) can still solo most content in open world and has boons to share with others, so that's pretty neat
---
Mirages have a ton of dodges to avoid incoming damage if you can predict your enemies actions
---
Chronos have a ton of blocks, invulns (distort) to avoid incoming damage
---
They both are pretty viable for soloing champions
---
Event mobs do count for the slayer achievements, but the branded enemies don't count at all. You can even use the arbiter that keeps spawning minions to complete it quickly.
---
The marionette!
---
i play via parsec, much better spen 300$ for andoroid tablet+keyboard and gampad, much better expirience
---
Is there an addon that increases fps? I remember someone mentioning such an addon on this sub but can't seem to find it. Also is it just me or is dragonfall giving some really bad fps?
---
Eaten
---
It turned out amazingly well! If I wasn’t already 8 clovers away from sunrise, I probably would’ve made this instead :p
---
Speaking of, do you think you guys might revisit some of the older legendaries and give them a polish? I know a few first gens seem to have some bugs in them
---
Unbound magic tools re-glyphed with glyphs of bounty = nice.
---
lol ya that made the tedium of making the third circuit around dragonfall on yet another collection not so bad.  That conversation fired off right as I was porting in and I laughed.
---
A legendary weapon only changes projectiles, not skill animations. The new legendary great sword is an exception. And the projectiles of meterologicus are beautiful. Much better than a weird cross you throw which is way too big.
---
Well this is amazing.
---
Thanks
---
All this positivity would be gone if they removed loot. Btw this map is the reason why they nerfed istan.
---
Yes, hardware and controller work.
---
Pro tip: Use the action camera in game.
---
Yeah. My friend who only plays some rare pvp/wvw hours was here when I was going through last instance and asked "Who's that Aurene dragon?"
---
*Where do I begin?*
---
This is what pisses me off.  I'm fine with a day between collections, but with the feeding 1st day is fine I had a few small collections to finish up, but then for 3 days I have to log in and do 3 quick clicks and have nothing else to do to do, nothing I can do.  Then when I am finally finished with it, I have to wait another damn day to finally move on to the next step of who knows what.
---
Even without the time gate this collection so far is way more tedious and time consuming than the griffon or nevermore.
---
I really do like the map, but I feel like the meta takes more time to complete than I really care to spend at once. I wish that most of the preamble stuff cleared a lot quicker. I do like the finale of it though a lot more than Auric Basin.
---
&gt; I dunno, Auric magic and her "echoes" as well as the TARDIS lair are well beyond Kralk's intellectual capacity and the Herald facets are broader too. Plus I don't recall Glint herself ever using Sun magic (nor the others for that matter) so she could have invented it and taught it to the Zephyrites as a benevolent spin "inspired by" Kralk but using regular elementalist traditions.
---
The Zephyrite Aspects were harvested from Glint's corpse.
---
_Holding a portion of her in my hand, I was able to walk on the wind, ride the lightning, and channel the sun to my will._
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Short_Story:_The_Trek_of_the_Zephyrites
---
TBH, the "tardis lair effect" is exactly what I felt was happening when we entered Kralkatorrik's mouth. After getting to that opening, it didn't really feel like we were actually inside Kralkatorrik.
---
The Herald facets are based on the six Facet mini-boss defenses she established in her lair in GW1 (we fought the remnants of them in Season 2). Each one was based off of a different profession, but they were effectively second-generation minions much like sylvari are, so it isn't surprising they could use other magics in comparison. Though in GW2, they're far more crystalline in design than in GW1, just using different effects with crystalline aesthetics. So maybe that's a bit of a retcon and it's still all crystal magic there.
---
&gt; I think you linked to the wrong page there, any "facet" spawned by Glint would still trace its heritage back to Kralk and share the "crystal resonance" thing.
---
I was never talking about crystal resonance, but rather the notion of whether or not purified minions can be re-corrupted. Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik both opted to kill their purified minion (Pale Tree and Glint), but we see them (attempting to) corrupt their purified minion's minions (sylvari and facets). Which shows they don't function similarly in all aspects.
---
&gt; Sylvari and Aurene are not second generation "minions" because their creators were purified beforehand although they do seem to be limited to the same physical framework as the progenitor ED.
---
Whatever you want to call Aurene, Facets, and sylvari, the fact is they were born / made by a purified dragon minion. That's all I meant by "second generation minion". Since we don't have an actual term for creatures imbued with dragon corruption that is used benevolently, like Caithe's post-The Crystal Blooms state. They're technically still dragon minions, but sylvari are vastly different from mordrem as facets are from branded.
---
More proof that they spent all their time on the Greatsword and gave the development of the Longbow to the drunk intern.

As long as you can still strip the rune or sigil out of dropped exotics and sell for gold and still keep the exotic for whatever reason.. is value enough for most.

That's a fact.

Pharos is the best.
---
......oh wait......
---
Me, doing stuff in Dragonfall for the skyscale, as I plummet off of a cliff at mach speed on my griffon: Wait a minute, here...
---
Tiddies.
---
I dunno, I personally really like Pharus. The simplicity of it is deliberate, albeit not all that inspired. I think bows in general kind of get the short end of the stick since they have the least spread of usage in the game when compared to pretty much any other weapon, even off hands. Still one of my favorite bows in the game, but it's all subjective in the end.
---
Exactly. They are ascended weapons with a little glow, nothing more. Can't understand why ANet try to make those things so special giving them stupid drop rates as rewards for big events.
---
how do you place wasd and space bar on the screen? I don't have that setting.
---
r/guildrecruitment is where you wanna look
---
I just don't like scavenger hunts to hit "F", or being forced to wait a day "BECAUSE..."
---
The first collection had the best time gate ever: "Complete 10 events in each lane."
---
If all of the time gates were like that, I wouldn't complain. Go do 10 world bosses. Go to X map and do # events. Those are great time gates, because it gets people out populating the maps and playing the game.
---
The waterlogged room for the Skyscale of Water is another great example of a good time gate. It's not "hey, wait this random period of time," it's "hey, there's a difficult puzzle that most people don't do because it's difficult to do alone, go do that puzzle together!"
---
I'm all for time gates that get me doing events and puzzles and things I might not normally do alone. Bring those on! Those are great! Just leave behind the "you'll have to wait until daily reset" and the "you can only feed them 3 times a day" behind. Its just not fun.
---
It's a hammer.

Been trying to look up builds, &amp; is it me or is it metabattle &amp; snow crows images don't load?  i messed about with different browsers but i couldn't get almost any pics to show(importantly the specializations to pick)
---
Still not worth, better investing one hour in something else, geting 25/30 g then that, still count power consumption that is needed for that..
---
Perhaps a bit too early to say for sure,
---
But on average start to finish of the meta, i was getting about 50 rares/100 greens/150 blues... With no magic find buffs &amp; only 150 magic find on my account... Around a dozen+ T6 mats as well.
---
Overall i think it's definitely one of the more profitable metas, but you need to complete events to get keys, which you then use to open 30ish locked chests at the end of the meta.
---
If you're lacking on keys, you won't get as many rewards ofc.
---
It's all tangled paths that come and go. Where a story ends others continue, and others begin.
---
The magic in her is probably older than Kralkatorrik.
---
I can see this map being revisited by the majority of the playerbase and up there with HoT maps and SW.
---
Serving Divinity's Reach destruction realness.
---
&gt;e
---
Opening blues seems to give more elder wood logs, which is great if you're making a legendary.
---
That's not as bad then. When I showed up to get my collections they'd already been defeated and the omni-djinn was there to offer the collections, but if the regular ones can do it that's great.
---
Hello downvote hero.
---
Its really sad for me to see how you are throwing out terms without really knowing what they mean. Persistent world, MMO, MMORPG... all of these are not what you think they are.
---
Here's a short explanation for you, so you dont have to look them up on the wiki:
---
Lobby games:
---
\- PvP games with a matchmaking system
---
MMO(G) = Massively Multiplayer Online Game with the following elements:
---
\- persistent world
---
\- with lots and lots of players
---
\- solely playable via internet
---
\- majority of the game is serverside, client only functions as display and for userinput
---
MMORPG add to that character creation and developement.
---
Persistent world:
---
Contrary to your belief, persistent world is in no way not exclusive to MMOs. Actually, its something that quite a lot of even completely offline games have. Tamagotchi for example. A persistent world simply means that you cant pause or stop the gameworld. So things happen even if you arent logged in.
---
Now what really tickles me, is that you think having any kind of instanced content excludes a game from having a persistent world. I mean, seriously? Here's a bit of a history lesson. Due to how servers couldnt calculate too many player interactions at once, instancing was used for big parts of any early Online-RPGs. Instanced group content was the only way for those to function. And when later on (around 2000) openworld became more and more possible with increased serverperformance and also increased playerbase, instanced group content never was abandoned. Its a core element that you can find in any classic MMORPG. And just because the main focus of some MMORPGs is on instanced content, doesnt mean they dont have a persistent world. Theres quite a difference between a game like Monster Hunter: World and WoW for example.
---
At the same time you saying that 40 man raids are "more MMO" than 10 man raids just plainly doesnt make any sense. Its still instanced content. 40 or 10 or 5 or 4, theres no difference. MMO is the term used to describe the WHOLE game, not a single part of it. Its a game GENRE. If WoW only had 40 man raids, and gw2 only had 10 man raids, then maybe... MAYBE it would make somewhat sense to say this. But as it is... no. Just no.
---
Thats one part of my answer to your asinine post.
---
The other part is: where did my post say anything about exclusively RAIDS? Where did I say RPG? What are you even TALKING about? Context? 
---
So your rant about raids in gw2 was not just 
---
a) substantive wrong but also
---
b) misplaced.
---
Have a nice day and keep on DOWNVOTING everything you dont agree with. Facebook hipsters like that.
---
Nothing cost more than 3k
---
You make it sound like you dont get showered in rares and gold alongside those drop rates
---
Are you saying he needs more time to think about gates?
---
Long story short. For someone who has no charged quartz or gold to spend it would take almost or around a month to finish it.
---
skyscale is the newest mount that got released tuesday. In order to get it, you have to complete a few collections, but the collections have to be done in order, and won't unlock until the daily reset after you complete the previous one. Not only that, but one of the collection requires you to have 22 charged quartz crystals, which are gated to only gathering 1/day, and also limits how many of them you can use for the collection at once. That means that we're effectively forced to wait at minimum 8 days (9?), even if you could grind out the work in 1-2 days
---
I have yes! I got my account back without issue.
---
Skipping Jumping Puzzles? Scandalous!
---
My male human elementalist doesn't know how old he is.  
---
Back before the Searing, he literally fell from the sky over a flame legion squad, right as they were about to slaughter a small settlement that was evacuating to south of the Great Wall. He miraculously survived the fall, and killed a few of them with his weight, in the chaos that ensued, he stood up and defeated the surviving charr while dazed and confused.  
---
He was badly hurt in the fall, and lost consciousness after the fight.  When he came to, he could not remember much before the fall, and just a little of the fight.  
---
He joined the villagers and helped them get safely to the south while recovering. Not knowing what else he could do, he decided to go with the suggestion of one of the villagers and travel to Ascalon City to join the fight against the charr. He discovered there that he had a natural ability for elemental magic, and was trained as an elementalist.  
---
He survived the Searing, traveled with Ascalon refugees to Kryta, discovered the truth about the White Mantle, ascendended, defeated the Undead Lich, became Weh No Su, cleansed Kuunavang, defeated Shiro, joined the Sunspears, reclaimed an ancient Shrine of Melandru for the Sunspears, help them rebuild their army and take the fight to Kourna, defeated Varesh, and destroyed Abaddon so Kormir could sacrifice herlsef to contain his power.  
---
After that he traveled to the north and rallied 3 armies and a bunch of norn to keep the Great Destroyer from awakening Primordus early, helped Gwen find love, culled the Mursaat threat until there was only a single sneaky survivor, and wiped all remaining Awakened from Cantha.  
---
And then, finally,  a moment of peace. He had been so busy for so long that he had never time to stop and think where he came from. So he started searching. Elona. Cantha. The North. The Charr homelands. Forgotten ruins. Rumors. Leads dig by the Whispers... he could not find anything, and by the time he realized, he had been traveling the world for decades without finding anything, and the dragons rose. After the troubles, when the dust settled, he realized that he had lived for over 250 years. He looked human, but was he really human?  Over the years his faced has changed a little, and he had gained a bit of height, but other than that he didn't look like he aged a single day.  His own origin was the only mystery he could never solve.  
---
In these times of danger and uncertainty, people would fear the unknown more than ever. Humanity barely remembered the hero of Nightfall. He was probably considered dead. He though it would be safer to keep it that way, at least until he finally learned where he came from, what he really was. 
---
A few bribes here and there, and in paper he was an orphan adopted by a noble.  He had now the identity of child who had lost his parents, and then lost his life in a centaur raid before he could even walk.  
---
He could now move from Lion's Arch to Divinity's Reach and use the city as a base of operations continue his research to the North and to the West, to Janthir and far beyond Maguuma.
---
He packed his things and left through the south door, only to find Shaemoor under attack.  
---
Ah, shit. Here we go again.
---
His next trip would have to be delayed. But it's not like that's much of a problem for someone who doesn't seem to age. He'd solve the current crisis before continuing his research. After it's easier to find information when the world isn't a pile of rubble and ashes.
---
ty, not sure what i wanted yet, guess i'll try again tomorrow.
---
we know skyscale masteries, those were shown on the anet stream.
---
New feature : you can now store foods in your wallet.
---
Oh no, don't get wrong, I do intend to spend the gold. I always find [something](https://i.imgur.com/fRBTkgA.png) to spend it on.
---
any update or News in DAY 4?
---
Im breaking it down for you:
---
MMO -&gt; genre
---
instanced content / raid -&gt; area/part of a game
---
Using one term to describe the other -&gt; like saying the weather is pink. It doesnt make sense and it makes you sound childlike.
---
MMOs are massively multiplayer and raids are a part of that. But games have turned intro that being the de facto end game in PvE and that is not an acceptable turn of event to everyone, that's all I'm saying. If you have a problem with that, I'm okay with it. I still stand by it. End game isn't just what one person thinks it is. Particularly not in a game where it was advertised otherwise. 
---
Sad that you feel the need to insult me, though.
---
You are the real MVP here. Thank you
---
So when you make a politics joke you get upvotes, but when anyone else does they get downvoted to oblivion?  Nice
---
likely a placeholder that made it through the code by mistake.
---
I also love it. Wasn't bored on this map yet. It seems to take many elements from the HoT maps and mashes them together into one big meta event. For me it doesn't feel as epic as DS but that is mostly because in DS we fight a huge ass moving Dragon(champion?) with unique model, animations etc. 
---
I'm really looking forward to S5. Especially because it will be the first season that can be done with a renewed focus on GW2.
---
S1 was an experiment. 
---
S2 ended with a one year gap to HoT. 
---
S3 started with a one year gap, improved a ton on everything but then they change the episode count fairly late giving us Sirens Landing and a very weird finale. 
---
S4 seemed off to a good start until you could feel that there was less and less events in the new maps. Seemingly because many Devs had to switch their initial position on the LW Team to the new projects. This all ended in layoffs. 
---
Let's get to S5. More focus on GW2. Hopefully bigger LW Teams with a story that maybe won't have to change last minute.
---
Here: (MEDIUM) Wide Rim Glasses, Noble Coat, Duelist Pants and any black shoes with a small heel. :)
---
yeah it does !
---
I've been waiting for Branded weapons for literally seven years.
---
I've run the map close to a dozen times already and I legit think that if you have a commander and a squad assigned to each zone you could burn through metas crazy fast. Or hell, if you get really coordinated you can run a sort of RIBA by circling on the beetle trackaround the map with a commander and tagalongs and leave some core people behind at each camp.
---
One thing I have noticed though is that you absolutely want to stagger camp events. Settling a camp is 3 chests and 3 keys per camp, which is just awesome.
---
i can't even tell what youre talking about because youre on a charr and i cant even recognize the boots cuz of your dang big ol paws
---
Don't they use an actual part of your screen? I'm pretty sure I once saw my ui reflected on a weapon.
---
I think it's because dragonstand has a more visible sense of progression. You move down lanes toward a goal. Here you set up all of the mechanics around the boss in the middle and then pour into the boss all at once.
---
You put it more bluntly than I would, but I can't say I disagree.
---
There really isn't a good solution for people who destroy their own fun, or are slaves to the optimal.
---
I remember people complaining in WoW about flying mounts. They wanted to explore these beautiful new zones, but due to flying, they had no reason to - it was just so much faster. I mean, consider that statement. They want to do this, but can't because it would be less time efficient.
---
Who gives a single god damn about *time efficiency* when you're having *fun*? I can't grasp it. I just can't grasp it. When playing games start becoming about numbers instead of enjoyment?
---
If a game has no content right now, why not play something else? Why keep playing something that's boring? All it does is cause burnout, and make a person unable to enjoy new content - because by that point, they're burnt out on *the game itself*, not some specific part of the game.
---
Time gates just seem like a way to try and save people from themselves. And rather than constraining everyone for the sake of this group, I'd prefer they just learn some restraint and self control.
---
Meh ... if I want a purple weapon I go for something from the funerary set and leave sand all over the place
---
Or  
---
*Or*  
---
just put your praise on the sub and stop caring about what other people are saying.  the subreddit is not an accurate representation of the whole playerbase by even a margin.  let them blow their smoke.
---
Basically, people are pretty unhappy with the fact that Skyscale needs timegated resources/activities to progress and unlock.
---
I suspect much of the anger is from the fact that :
---
1. People who invest their time heavily to play the game on release will be miffed that they can't unlock the mount on the same day (talking bout those like me who have to work and took work leave to catch the update)
---
2. Timegating + very long collection makes people who wanna make guides/show off/experiment stumped and angry.
---
The shape actually works out beautifully for beattle riders. You can run a whole circuit largely uninteruppted.
---
I like branded and purple.
---
I'm sick of desert and wanna move on.
---
If I wanted something purple (not mesmer main) I would go for dominator weapons, very original and beautifully designed
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistborn_Coffer
---
Oh. No, that’s working fine. The wolf head only shows when using warhorn skills that are coded as projectile skills, like Tempest air 5, Ranger wh 5, Warrior wh 4 and 5. 
---
I do think they should change it to affect all skills, not just those coded as projectiles, but as it stands I’m afraid it’s working as intended
---
That was literally the first thing on my mind when I saw that the islands landed out in the ocean.
---
Almost. The only disappointing thing for me, is that every of the 3 regions have exactly the same types of events just reskinned. I wish every region had it's unique events. Beside that minor complaint, map really is very good. It's the best of open world design by Anet. Mor maps like that!
---
While Dragonfall second solid LW map after Istan, Silverwastes is rather superior map anyway. SW have labyrinth and huge jumping puzzle aside 4-phase meta + chestfarm mech.
---
Actually three year old, she was born in LWS3E2.
---
I just did a test, and the wolf head is only appearing for the warrior and ranger skills you mentioned. All I get on any tempest or necro skill is this [weird ring](https://i.imgur.com/XXXnWIZ.jpg) that appears above the war-horn.
---
I could have sworn it played the wolf head animation for all of the tempest war-horn skills...
---
Saw it too, was just to lazy to make a post about it.
---
&gt; imagine how much it would suck if you finished a part just two hours late, two hours after daily reset. You'd have to wait another 22 hours to start the next part. 
---
or worse ... you are one item short and reset rolls around
---
Next season will be another color theme don’t worry xd
---
None.  The bottleneck of a \~50+ player world boss is the CPU.  The graphics literally don't matter.  
---
And there's nothing you can do about the CPU, either.  Hell I bet even a supercomputer's CPU would end up getting bottlenecked because this game's spaghet code just can't do anything else with it.
---
I'm completely with you there, the map is great, but the ending is unsatisfying at best. A large part of why I like dragon's stand is you feel like you're battling a damn elder dragon at the end. In dragonfall it feels like you're just tearing scabs off :c
---
Thanks for the tips, I did end up doing that to no avail but eventually as I sat on my ticket the thought occurred to me that on the several maps I was farming I was only killing brackish skales.  
---
In a moment of "why not" I went to a zone that had a DIFFERENT type of skale just to see what would happen and got two livers from the first group of skale I killed.   
---
But I don't think I would have thought of that without all the advice, so thanks again! My skyscale is now fully treated-up.
---
Does f2p people unlock springer, skimmer and jackal as well? And we who bought PoF and HoT can get the Raptor, gliding and griffin?
---
Why meteorlogicus when there's others out there with less love?
---
That would depend on what angle you are looking at them and they are more green/blue than purple.
---
I can see that value today.  But once legendary sigils and runes arrive, will any rune or sigil retain their value?
---
Now THAT is a timegated dragon raising
---
The most obvious answer is repeatable content. Fractals, raids, WvW, sPvP, and rewarding farms are all gifts that keep on giving. Most people I know who play the game a lot are heavily involved with one of the above forms of content. Story episode content, at least as it has been handled for a long time, is inherently one-off and honestly just isn't designed to be stretched out.
---
The extension of this is to then add more forms of repeatable content. Make sure metas are worth playing. Bring back monthly achievements. Make raid CMs repeatable. Balance competitive game modes.
---
For what it's worth, bonus weeks/weekends are great forms of recurring content as well. I'm glad they're looking into making these more regular. They just have to make it not a complete waste of time like with the world boss thing, but the core idea is sound.
---
Because The Dreamer has everything a Tier 2 Legendary has and it is only a Tier 1 Legendary.
---
It will likely be like the risen, they are largely not under anyone’s control unless there happens to be a localised leader controlling them. Aurene probably could take control but we don’t really know what she will be doing moving forward. I can see the inquest rounding them up to control them since they have done some experiments in that already.
---
Wheb you buy PoF you can go into the PvP lobby and try out all the new elite specs as they are fully unlocked once you own the relevant expansion. See for yourself what elite spec you like the best and if you want to raid/fractal and have a 'meta' class, all you need to do is look on metabattle.
---
You have 10 hours to decide!
---
Bruh literally every MMORPG is repeat content &gt; get reward
---
Yeah, I was really surprised when I ran into a Skyscale Rift in Drytop. I’m looking forward to finding all of them.
---
But but i dont like that i had to wait when I played a strory and meta blocked cave entrance :/
---
Dragonfall have a nice enviroment
---
Another note: if someone joins your squad and says full map please either take yourself off of LFG or update the listing so it says full.
---
Huh, that’s odd. There’s a number of times where I go to the map and I end up in one that literally just reset. 
---
Still, it’s like the Silverwastes. Stick around long enough and you’ll see it start from the beginning before too long.
---
Can second the holosmith (engineer.)
---
In regards to using addons I've seen one keypress one action policy, but popular arcdps buildtemplates seem to break this rule.
---
Does Arena net have a stance on using scripts for inventory activities like these?
---
Are scripts allowed for stuff like mistic forge crafting or bag openings?
---
quality content
---
I've found that the roller is rather resilient to fall damage so long as you've got a decent amount of horizontal momentum!
---
We already have systems in game to stop leechers from getting rewards - the participation system. It's like every time they take a step forward, they also take two steps back.
---
Christ it's been awhile I completely forgot they added rewards. People do listen to the story, at least i did cause guild wars was always about story to me. I will concede the personal story was only occasionally good. Only part that really stuck was order of whispers who the npc is from, the rest felt bland.
---
Companies love taking advantage of people like you. If people only did what you are doing, we would have companies like EA still forcing grind on players, forcing them to wait to play characters like Luke and Vader. 
---
Maybe this timegating shit would have been okay for cosmetic items, but it is not when it offers gameplay changes. With timegating, people that want that mount are forced to rushing the content instead of playing content that they enjoy, because timegating punishes you for not actively working on the collections.
---
Exactly this. I don't understand why they couldn't make this like Dragon's Stand.
---
They got us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
So, what do you say now. 😁
---
I hope he is very different than what we've seen if they do go his route. Very Old One-ey like you said.
---
I got that one with griffon just fwiw, flew over from the cliffs to the south
---
The praise for the episode and map are drowned out by (justified) complaints about the mount collection.
---
I worked on this feature, and look at that, its a real meme now. I can die happy now.

Sounds just like me irl tbh so all good
---
Did the already existing thread on it vanish? no? then why do you feel the need to ask people to tell you directly rather than just looking at that.
---
Because if it always happen at the exact same time people who cant play during those times will never ever be able to do it?
---
Arm and Aura would be 2 different things.
---
Lore explanations lol. Next thing Anet should do then is have each story mission be accessed on next reset. Because you know, characters have to take time to rest. 
---
The game was fine when it didn't have time-gating for things that change up gameplay. Shit like this sets terrible precedent for the future. Imagine being time-gated for things like specializations or masteries. This is just unacceptable.
---
Oh, weird. That's worth a bug report :(

Cool fashion wars btw

I'll do this in wvw for trebbing shit in ebg, it's underrated. Very playable as it's locally rendering on your pc (opposed to on a server or w/e).
---
Because their not "Tier 1" and "Tier 2". It's "Generarion 1" and "Generation 2". The HoT legendaries (now also PoF because... well...) were only meant to serve as an optional way to craft and a new set of skins. Not improved skins or better than Gen 1 legendaries (though some Gen 1 are, and some Gen 2 are).

THere is a major difference: Dragon Stand is timed. It will end regardless after 2 hours. Dragonfall will continue on forever unless people do the events.
---
And why would you want to do this? The controls are horrible.
---
gen1 legendary love wen ANet??  
---
...probably sometime after gen 3... :D
---
Then put reset timer on it, regardless of success.
---
An simple example of a catch up mechanic would be to implement some sort of buffer. Imagine you could only earn 1 million mastery exp a day, but any experience that you haven't earned on a specific day is stored in an exp buffer, up to a maximum of 5 million exp. This means that you could go 5 days without playing and earn that 5 million exp in one sitting, putting you on the same level as players who earned 1 million exp playing every day.
---
That's my biggest beef with engi, I really want to use a cool hammer but it disappears if I use a lot (which as a basic flamethrower juggernaut, is all the time)
---
I am loving this map too. Loved HoT maps and rarely visit PoF maps. This is the perfect balance. 
---
I think if they had progression bars for contribution building up to the meta like HoT maps it might help more people feel the direction of progression. I know they have the camp upgrade status, but the bar is more personal. 
---
Also a daily hero chest and a chance of something very rare would go a long way to people doing the meta boss, as I'm seeing people jumping maps before the meta is done because time and events being more profitable that way.  Last night got map switch alerts around meta time a few times over.
---
As I said, we deserve everything right away. That's how the game should work. It's just the worst if they add RP elements to the RPG.
---
Grinding things out right away is always the best.
---
I think many or all living story maps are unique. Other than that, yeah, it's by region.
---
Ah rip
---
My accoungt seemingly got compromised some time after I quit game a few weeks after the original release of the game. It was no issue to get it back but since I didn't know when it was originaly compromised I had no date when to reset it to (seemingly they can restore it to certain old backups) since I didn't even know when exactly I originaly quit.
---
Tho, didn't really matter, as I didn't have much stuff anyways and whoever played it leveled a new character for me and left me more gold than I had before.
---
Except New World and Ashes of Creation have been already player. New World has its alpha and Ashes let's people play current version of the game from time to time. And guess what, people reactions are overwhelmingly positive. 
---
Anyway I do not want to continue this pointless conversation. I feel like I'm just throwing a ball at a wall.
---
Which legendaries are meh for you?
---
Thanks for this! I've commanded a squad a day (it's vm farm that pays for itself in gold without selling your T6 trophies... legendary crafting friendly) and this bit always throws me off.
---
Wow so hard... So thoughtfull.
---
all the s4 maps
---
In this map I feel like I am stuck in a fractal myself. Escorting npcs, build up a camp, upgrade it, the final attack on kralk and do some bonus events. Then few mins later you start from the base again like never happened and here I go again, going on a new adventure and gaining new experiences like I've never been there before. :O
---
yeah! its such a good farm but i see a lot of groups thrown off at this point, so i took some time to run around and see what the best path was i could find for getting em all.  
---
So far i'm 1/1 runs with getting all 9 since i made the map :) posting it here in the hopes it can help more people too
---
Doesn't make sense since Gaeting Crystals are for raids after PoF. Next raid is also supposed to be a continuation to the last one (this fire Djinn).
---
I was saving for greatsword and pre-crafted it in a week after I saw it. Very nice! THANK U KINDLEH.
---
That's to prevent people from multi loot aka map hopping to get chests after meta. It doesn't close once the boss rush timer ends.
---
Call me strange, but  I don't tend to bond with video game characters and mounts.  I mean Wario is obviously one thing, but anything else is just pixels.
---
Yeah i pretty much gave up on GW2 in January and playing Warframe instead.    
---
Content is fun. /shrug
---
Welcome to flavor town.
---
Dragonfall is definitely my favourite LS4 map as well, I really liked how they provided what we asked: another large meta map built around the last epic fight of an Elder Dragon. In my opinion the map is satisfying, I do miss a moving Elder Dragon fight, just like the Mouth of Mordremoth (who wasn’t a champion, but an Elder Dragon’s head) but I also feel like fighting Kralkatorrik’s Head would’ve been a bit repetitive. They could’ve given us an epic underground fight, but then I don’t know how they could close the story in a personal instance (given that us killing Mordremoth’s Head didn’t mean anything, because he could just regenerate himself after a while, that’s why we had to fight his Mind). Fighting the weak spot is an interesting task, and the map itself is near perfect.
---
&gt; I can't grasp it. I just can't grasp it
---
Well some people, probably not a small number have this internal itch that when they are spending time playing a video game they want to spend their time efficiently, since time is a limited commodity for most of us. To such people (myself included) it is hard to concentrate on smelling the roses, since there is always a thought in the back of their head - they could be spending this time doing something that will further their goal in the long run. Be it making money or pursuing other goals you set, most of which require a significant amount of effort. And if your goal is to have 10k gold spending time on anything but the mose efficient farm is just a loss of time.
---
That aside, if you play for 24h straight after patch day, complete everything and complain there is nothing else to do, you have no right to further complain that there is not enough to do. There never will be for such players.
---
Yes, Anet thank you for great ending of Season 4, and a great map to play in.
---
get embers while on weak spots, then switch to spears for bosses.  
---
You can wp to the shrines while in combat (and at no personal expense)
---
Oh I get that entirely. I understand that time is limited. I often flew around simply because I just didn't feel like smelling the roses.
---
But I don't see the point in worrying about goals when your time is so finite. It's precious. It's precisely for that reason I'd rather spend it on what I know I'll enjoy. I'd rather accomplish a goal slowly and have fun doing it, than get it done quickly and loathe logging in to get it done.
---
That was what I didn't get. I can understand these people want to get from point A to point B. But they *wanted* to walk there. So why couldn't they just make the choice to stop and smell the roses? Why did they value those goals, that efficiency, more than their own enjoyment? Life is enough of a rat race as it is. Why bring that mentality into one's already scarce leisure time?
---
&gt;That aside, if you play for 24h straight after patch day, complete everything and complain there is nothing else to do, you have no right to further complain that there is not enough to do. There never will be for such players.
---
Totally agree.
---
Volatile magic
---
I think the person you're replying to is talking about the OP's post. lol
---
I remember when The Flameseeker Prophecies's pages used to keep turning after draw.
---
From data mine it looks much more probably that 5th step will require you to spend PoF and LS4 currencies.
---
Can also shrine back after #8 to get to #9 easily.
---
Yea, the thing is that efficiency is enjoyable for us. If there is no efficiency, there is not that much enjoyment. Or rather, the enjoyment would be bigger if we could be efficient at the same time. Thus, increased efficiency on our enjoyment!
---
The cycle never ends :p
---
I'm more pissy about the charged quartz crystals. The twenty-something days is already a god damn annoyance. If you have limited time, you're about ready to bite the head off of nails for this shit.
---
They told us that backpieces are coded differently than armor is, closer to weapons. So they probably don't have any dye channels on a lot of the backpieces, and the ones that do have it on the gliders only.
---
Same here. I also had a lot of fun with the Skyscale of \[noun\] collections; revisiting old maps and all that. And the fact i could see where to go on the minimap made it so much less frustrating than other collections of that size, too.
---
&gt;this fire Djinn
---
QADIIIIIIIIIIM!
---
I’m in this boat as well. They do a good enough job crafting their own lore without being derivative.
---
Actually, from back in the day when celestial Ele was relevant, I crafted WupWup armor. It's since been re-statted of course, but making those quartz Crystal's made me want to deepthroat a double barrel, so I just made making them part of my daily routine. I now have over 2 stacks lol
---
I've completed everything except the various domain slayer and doing meta 25 times achievements, including the skyscale stuff I can do so far. Didn't use a guide for anything. If you actually put in the effort, none of the achievements are hard or anything. It's just a lot quicker with guides.
---
Pretty sure Hydra staff is in there now mate.
---
From what people have seen on streams it's going to take 12 point to max out the mastery line.
---
Every 2nd or 3rd day, starting at 20:00 cet at [&amp;BN4HAAA=]
---
Thank you, I'll keep an eye out.
---
Ah, that's really useful to know thank you. I only have 5-10 statuettes, but I'll gamble on the BLT on this one occasion.
---
Sword is the weapon used by most classes. The only one that doesn’t use it is necro.
---
if the cooldown for feeding was 1h and not 24h then yeah it could've been adorable. instead it's cancer.
---
Gonna be honest, the downvotes are probably because you made a 'this' comment.
---
Reddit has upvotes so you don't need to make 'this' comments; consequently they tend to get downvoted to oblivion.
---
Hydra is in the RNG boxes now so I wouldn't hope for it to quickly appear for statuettes any time soon.
---
&gt; Next will come with season 5
---
Which will be probably tied to something other than open world/raids.
---
We have:
---
* WvW
---
* PvP
---
* Fractals
---
which could fill the 3 (if we exclude ring) legendary trinkets left. One trinket for each mode.
---
There are 5 achievements, not just 3.
---
Fun + Dungeons = Fungeons

what stellar content this is indeed
---
Lol
---
Then you don't do it. I'm sorry, but you gotta have at least **some** dedication. It sucks, but it is what it is - you're just gonna have to deal with it. Welcome to MMORGPs.
---
Saw the picture and was thinking about Killer Bee without reading the title.
---
And what a dick the raptor seems to be...
---
he has one job...
---
Kinda think it's possible to copy code from dyeable armor (legendary armor now has animations) to make weapons and back dyable. All the position data is available already.
---
Is that skin from orr? It could be their undying...I'll see myself out
---
&gt; if the cooldown for feeding was 1h
---
Can't you really imagine the flood of "FFS ANET IS THIS A MOBILE GAME WHY DO YOU FORCE ME TO LOG IN EVERY HOUR" rage threads on reddit if that were the case?
---
he was very tired
---
Even if... Low priority
---
Phase-Shifted, Signaler on Forgotten Priest was the worst I've ever seen so far on that map. Flayer is also annoying with it's short CC phase, so you need to deal with unstabs through the whoooole fight. But rotation is definitely doable with 4-5 minutes to spare.
---
8th gen i7 with water cooling (not liquid cooling - they're different) should be good.
---
&gt;  I think people had the expectation to get this mount on a silver plate instead of having to put some effort into it. Quite unfortunate.
---
Expected to get the mount on a silver plate? That is not even the primary general criticism. Yes there is complaining about the multiple collections but it is the timegates that are the major issue, especially since you have stacking timegates like the charged crystals being needing in high quantities. The ones further along in the collections all probably have the griffon and know what it took to get that. Hell, even the beetle took effort. So to reference people expecting to get this one handed too us is being dense.
---
I think its mostly people killing ones they need for the achievement right now. Sure they could just follow the train, but the champs seem weaker then normal bounties and can be soloed, so they do that instead.
---
like every other map in the game?
---
All maps are perpetually stuck in groundhog day XD
---
I absolutely can say that. ArenaNet designed their mounts to feel rewarding to use by specifically not making them boring MMORPG-floaters, and instead giving them abilities that required *somewhat* clever and/or creative usage to get where you want.
---
The Skyscale is the polar opposite of this idea.
---
That's why I have trust issues with my items and hoard them. Never know when you might need that potion for a boss fight.
---
How do you switch mounts so quickly?
---
All other maps are like stuck in time, except for the player character, but in this new map i also feel like im living in a timeloop myself aswell ;)
---
You can bind individual mounts to individual keys in the control settings.
---
I bound all my mounts to F6-F12
---
Add time games to the personal story so you're only allowed to complete the story in the same period of time that it took canonically. Personal story now lasts over a year because that's how long it took to take down Zhaitan. Bada-bing, bada-boom we just made a year of "content" like that. Clearly this is the superior method because we can't have people completing the personal story in three days because ???.
---
What armor or outfit is that??
---
It's not impossible, because they've already done it. In fact they did update Meteorlogicus last year to have projectile effects, as well as Bolt for certain classes like Guardian sword 3.
---
Congratulations, you have realized that the timegating adds nothing to the game.
---
The timegate in the third step is especially galling since there's such a small amount of activity available before you hit the gate. It's the weekend and I'd love to be working on unlocking the Skyscale because that's what I would like to do. Except I'm up to the stage where I throw 3 pieces of meat at a hatchling and that's it. Cut off. I've had too much Skyscale activity today. Time to go do something else with my time lest I burn myself out with the twelve seconds of "content" I experienced there before I was gated off.
---
Ahah, Read Dyes again my friend, top left of your screenshot xD ( sad joke sorry )
---
Just to add, the black lion chests/statuettes are usually updated every ~6 weeks.
---
Fair point, but already patched
---
Have you seen the amount of posts? It is a change. Also if you read correctly I said that criticising is fine. But something A CHANGE can also be a change of perspective. Mind that. 
---
Thanks for your opinion anyway
---
Just buy it of the tp ...
---
Collection 6 will require anyone who doesn't have a credit score of over 780 to immediately fail the collection and be permanently barred from obtaining the mount.
---
I agree with you, but I got tired of arguing about it. I always get a lot of play from each of the new zones stories, every month. I wouldn't get as much from a raid or a fractal. I wouldn't do the raid at all and i wouldn't do the fractal that often. Different strokes for different folks.
---
None are "meh", I didn't want to imply that. It would just be nice if the older legendaries could receive a little of the same polish, and maybe have some of their own issues fixed.
---
I am sure I am forgetting some of them and others know more, so here are only two issues that are in the game felt like forever, complained about often, but so far not changed:
---
- Engineers, while using a kit (which the whole class is about) don't have the footfalls of the equipped weapon.
---
- Off-hand legendaries don't have their footfalls shown if a main-hand legendary is wielded.
---
Now that one greatsword even changes for non-combat activities, leaving the others kind of behind in terms of sophistication. Now we have 4 legendary GSs, a two-handed weapon, of which you can wear only one anyway. Next to that look at the other legendaries: two for each, even for one-handed weapons.
---
Of course you can say that all of Sunrise/Twilight/Eternity is really just one legendary. And yes, it is, it is a cool concept to be able to combine them. And for which weapon type was this done, exclusively? See what I mean?
---
Just using the borrowed Scales in Dragonfall, I’ve noticed that if I am at all off the ground when I interact with the Skyscale to mount it, I am automatically hovering once the Scale is active. I can only assume this is how it might work once the actual mount is in play.
---
Thanks. I haven't seen that backpack set in years. I'm not very hopeful, but it would be nice.
---
It's as simple as that.  
---
Content isn't "What I want to do" but "What can be done". One not liking what can't be done won't make it stop existing.
---
thanks! Will certainly give it a try!
---
I don't bond with animals in real life, so screw them in games. Sometimes I bond with game characters, but give me a robot and I'll cry whenever it breaks.
---
Half of the atoms in my body are older than the Milky Way, but I doubt that made me any brighter when I was five.
---
&gt;  4 legendary GSs
---
I would see these 3 as 1,5 at most. 2 of them just have different hilt and different blade color while the third one is basically mix of two (day and night). Sharur also have day and night versions merged together but they are not that great like old GS though.
---
NOOOO
---
I for one welcome our new lich queen dragon overlord.
---
Imagine how cool it'd be if the color scheme changed based on which class had the weapon equipped. I love the frickin thing but I enjoy warrior and it would look pretty dumb to have a shiny blue raindow stick. Same problem with the white aura and blue glow on legendary armor.
---
Lol and dos is better than most of PC users on this sub
---
I'm having fun with the collection. I enjoy doing large collections at a relaxed pace and there's nothing wrong with delayed gratification.
---
The sour taste in my mouth is the endless whining and bitching in chat and on reddit, to the point where I just turn it off.
---
The Skyscale treats, someone told me i only need 12, but other told me i need more than 12?
---
any idea what buff is it? [https://i.ibb.co/x26fHB8/2019-05-18-162244.png](https://i.ibb.co/x26fHB8/2019-05-18-162244.png)
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm invested in the story itself because I enjoy the game.  I'm just not that invested into the characters because in large part I feel the characters are pretty weak.  Even by video game standards.
---
I'd like to say that that the ending of episode 5 bothered me, but I for one I just didn't think they could allow themselves to stand.  Mainly though, they just never gave me reason to really care.  Yes there was some story where we essentially trained Aurene, but otherwise she was out of the picture and Caithe's problem.  Then all of a sudden I was expected to feel like I raised her though I had spent most of her life away from her.
---
The overall story is fun and interesting and one of the reasons I stay playing and supporting the game.  The details though are imo at least forced more often than not.
---
Heyhey, check out this: https://redd.it/bphd9u
---
It is very similar to yours with some more detailed pathing on the map and another route to the shadow elementalist :)
---
It's a really well put together collection. Makes me sad that we may not see more like it in the future due to the crybaby community.
---
**P R A Y R E T U R N T O T H E W A K I N G S A N D S**
---
&gt; what they actually mean is 'GW2 has no content that I want to play, 
---
I think this is an important part. With every release, more and more people seem to be getting bored with/annoyed with, at least what they perceive to be, a lack of content. This isn't good for the game. If the players are continually disappointed, they'll leave.
---
That being said, I think GW2 has had fairly balanced quarterly earnings, so either people are leaving and the whales are just dumping more and more money in, or people are happier with the game than they may realize. 
---
For me, personally, this episode is very light on content, but what matters is that what content there is to do is fun. I really love the new map and the meta is nice and easy, it doesn't require hair loss to finish and the rewards are really great. My best guess is people are disappointed with the lack of new instanced content, pvp, etc. So the casual pve experience may not do it for them, and again, that's a problem for the game. But you are correct, content people don't like doesn't mean no content at all.
---
I just really hope the commander can go explore some unknown Areas of the world, now that this Storyline is completed.
---
Stepping down as Commander would be a start, then maybe getting asked by the Queen to look into what happened to Cantha?
---
And if you could complete it instantly: "This patch was great but what now? Got to wait another 3 months for another map? This game will die soon if Anet don't change their update schedule. We need more long term goals!"
---
Ayy! It instantly gave me an idea!

Guardian whirl and Warrior spin turn it into a switchaxe

Wait until the next part drops in Vabbi. The Air/Water/Earth/Fire Champions all at once to start the roosting of skyscales looks insane.

Honestly I’d say this all started with LS1. It is what set the current tone of awakened dragons and such into play. Taught us about ley lines a bit more, and helped introduce everyone. 
---
Personal story was a good ending point but LS1 introduced our current problems which have just now been basically solved.
---
This is why many break off into smaller groups midway. 
---
For example, I was missing branded hydra at the end and kept seeing groups not making it that far. So myself and a few other people went there, when it was looking like there wouldn't be enough time for the train to get there and we managed to take it down with just four people.
---
Not gonna lie, I'll be disappointed if there wasn't at least one person out there somewhere who was channeling the egg pick up and suddenly got slammed by that.
---
You can repeat raids, but you can't repeat metas?
---
the skyscale food is 12
---
treats are 14
---
I've made several. In fact I made Exordium within 10 minutes of its release, and it's not the first one I've made on patch day. 
---
They are way more costly because they all use the same mats, which reduces supply with a high demand. Demand will naturally decrease in particular now with no more weapon legendaries coming out. 
---
No one apart from you are calling them a tier 2 legendary, that I have seen. Their identification is generation 2 legendaries and were never announced to be a better legendary than the first generation. There are literally several legendaries that prove that point by their sheer amount of "meh" compared to their Generation 1 counterpart.
---
They stopped including those after the first 4 or so gen 2s, they were fun up to the last bits that needed like 20 elonian leather, assuming all the many events were A) working and B) didn't require other events to fail to get to them.
---
Even if you do look at it like that the skyscale is still the biggest content in this release, running a map meta over and over again isn't exactly engaging content that has endless potential.   
---
In case you do consider this content then if only crafting were in the game or just basic events from PoF that are repeatable then the game has content for forever x)   
---
What you probably don't understand is when people cry for content then they usually mean worthwhile content, if you still do everything (ignoring skyscale) your done with the content within a week, unless again you find running meta over and over again content then you have stuff to do for the rest of the games life I guess.    
---
That's still 1 week of new and exciting stuff every 3-4 months like the others have been.   
---
While I don't consider metas content exactly (more a gold farm) if they added one as good as the HoT ones in terms of profit you'd have way less people complaining about it simply because they will be able to farm there for god knows how long (like Istan was).   
---
And to touch on the last bit, if the game gets more and more "content" that the players don't want to do it will still make them leave and there being SOME SORT of content doesn't matter in the slightest. If it ain't fun/engaging/rewarding people won't do it, simple as. It is a game at the end of the day and people have to want to play it.   
---
How many WvW players dissapeared over the years at the lack of content? Raiders crying for faster raid releases for ages now.   
---
The fact that anet is doing all these new events for PvE and PvP (wb rush and no down state), reviewing PoF metas etc.  just proves people do, in fact, want more content. We're playing an MMO at the end of the day,a nd logetivity of content in an MMO is EXTREMELY important. So if the content doesn't have replayability or longetivity then it's simply stapled as there being no more content, it's there sure, but what's the incentive to repeat it in a loop for months to come until the next LWS?   
---
tl;dr It's simply code for too little of it/doesn't have replayability
---
&gt;	When anyone says ‘GW2 has no content’ what they actually mean is ‘GW2 has no content that I want to play, or that engages me.’ 
---
That is OP’s point. It’s clearly stated in the post. We’ve seen numerous complaints this week, and after just about any LW release, that Anet puts out very little content. Content you don’t personally enjoy is still content.
---
&gt; My question is: Can I stay a base class thief and never become a daredevil or deadeye, even through late-end game content, in WvW, pvp, and fractals/raids?
---
For open world and story, yes. Though the expansions and Living World are a step up in difficulty so you'll have to, well, "git gud". Fractals and competitive play are where meta reigns supreme and last I heard base teef ain't it.
---
However I recommend getting daredevil just for the extra dodge alone.
---
I call it the Hate Orgy. We have one every time a major release happens, and we have them over trivial things that aren’t even strictly game related. People who aren’t even angry about whatever the Orgy is over will get caught up in it and join in.
---
They explicitly said that raid is going to have its own release next after this chapter.
---
no, i can't
---
How is it today?
---
&gt; The Zephyrite Aspects were harvested from Glint's corpse.
---
My question is whether they impart *power* or *knowledge*. Both can fade if the storage is damaged and the more powerful Zephyrites seem to be capable of using their abilities without a supply of crystals at hand, though of course they could drain the magic from said crystals and store it in their bodies.
---
&gt; The Herald facets are based on the six Facet mini-boss defenses she established in her lair in GW1 (we fought the remnants of them in Season 2). Each one was based off of a different profession, but they were effectively second-generation minions much like sylvari are, so it isn't surprising they could use other magics in comparison. Though in GW2, they're far more crystalline in design than in GW1, just using different effects with crystalline aesthetics. So maybe that's a bit of a retcon and it's still all crystal magic there.
---
If Glint could impart control over magic she herself did not posess into her creations why not into her own body? 
---
&gt; I was never talking about crystal resonance, but rather the notion of whether or not purified minions can be re-corrupted. Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik both opted to kill their purified minion (Pale Tree and Glint), but we see them (attempting to) corrupt their purified minion's minions (sylvari and facets). Which shows they don't function similarly in all aspects.
---
The Pale Tree and Glint seem to be vastly more powerful though so maybe they just weren't able to overcome that, or they considered them too great a threat to let live. If there is any difference I would assume it to be the direct lasting effect of the purification ritual itself rather than fundamental mechanics of ED reproduction.
---
&gt; Whatever you want to call Aurene, Facets, and sylvari, the fact is they were born / made by a purified dragon minion. That's all I meant by "second generation minion". Since we don't have an actual term for creatures imbued with dragon corruption that is used benevolently, like Caithe's post-The Crystal Blooms state. They're technically still dragon minions, but sylvari are vastly different from mordrem as facets are from branded.
---
I was mainly thinking of the Destroyer Queen and potentially Thornhearts/other living mob spawners. Those are born "second generation" without any purification and to my knowledge show no diversification of magical attunements beyond what the ED itself was already capable of at the time.
---
Basically I believe the purification is the hard breaking point which eliminates boundaries posed by the ED domains while you seem to think the creation of living offspring to be a necessary intermediate step.
---
How did you get it?
---
all these things also cost a lot of gold that most ppl need to get, so the timegate from relics/LI etc doesn't feel as bad as "you have to wait 24h to feed hatchling again, because we say so". 
---
also the process of getting legendary armor/fractal god relies on daily/weekly activites that PRODUCE income and that people do anyway - so i didn't feel any frustration on getting those, as there were other perks to playing fractals/raids. waiting for relic/LI timegate was rewarding. 
---
gaining nothing and just being a subject to artificially imposed time-gate is frustrating, thats why so many people are negative about it.
---
[This is the chart I could find but it lacks 2019.](https://imgur.com/a/hY5ed0F#W7vehZA)
---
Its been mostly downhill since release with slight upticks on expansion releases.
---
In one week time we wont have anything to do anyway, so I dont care if this mount takes 1 day or 10 days. Generally GW2 is all about time gate and this is just normal.
---
To be fair. I am with GW since 2006 Factions release and 3k+ hours on GW2. The only reason I am still playing because all other MMOs have rather bad mech or korean-style grind build in to consume your life essence and motionary health.
---
Real content that I ever cared about in GW was RA and HA with occasional AB for lulz. In GW2 I really enjoyed fractals and WvW. Both gamemodes receive update once a year tops, while labeled endgame...
---
Ok what do we have this release? 
---
- New map, cool map btw. Great farm. Do I need it? Really not, I have Legendary armor on my WvW guard and full ascended gear on 4 other played alts. I can do WvW and t4 as usual, witch had no updates and after several hours I start question myself "ok why I am doing this again?"
---
- Armor. Great one. Done with 6 upgraded parts unlocked that I care about.
---
- Gateskale. Well, I have griffon. While I done every step available, something tells me that I was better off just playing WvW instead.
---
What if one of the developers was part of the creation of tamagochi, then they realized kids don't actually wanna do that shit and he is angry they just carelessly let those digital animals die. Now it all makes sense, it really is payback time
---
So tell me, how did Aurene resurrectherself after Kralkatorik consumed her power when he killed her? This includes the power from joko.
---
Wait, it falls from the sky? I thought it just materialized out of thin air like most event "objects".
---
As an example the last quarter was higher than the quarter before, not much higher, but higher.
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Installing
---
I'm not too salty about the time-gating, but the endless collections (in this event and all the others in the game) require that I have a guide open from Dulfy or elsewhere. It makes me feel like I'm playing the game in the wrong way. **I would love to see an option where an arrow or 'mini leyline' is shown in game that trails you to your next objective.** This would be a far more pleasant way of playing and keep me focussed on the goals. What is likely to happen right now is that I'll forget where I was up to, what I needed to collect, and just forget about it (I've never unlocked the beetle for this very reason).
---
Yeah, but the next one after that was lower than both of them. It seems to be on a downward spiral.
---
&gt; Isn't it like 4 days?
---
Assuming you got 22 charged quartz handy, its 9 days minimum. 5 from the daily resets + 4 more because the third part of the collection has a 4 day timegate on it sown.
---
If you got no charged quartz then its either 31 days or a shitload of gold (100g+)
---
It is ok, you guys are just cry babies
---
You can buy the choise chest from TP and select it there AFAIK
---
&gt;... give me a robot and I'll cry whenever it breaks.
---
Wall-E was such a good movie. I recently rewatched it and struggled not to cry like a big softy.
---
&gt; Not necessarily. Hot was a deeply unpopular expansion when it first came out, and it caused some people to leave the game.
---
That doesn't actually change what I said though.
---
You explained the reason, but that alter the final result PoF sold less than HoT when its what's supposed to be a grand "reopening" to draw tons of new players in.
---
&gt; But if you go on the quarters following POF, you'll generally see it did more money than the quarters after HoT. That's what I"m talking about.
---
Yeah but if you account for the fact that PoF sold less that means that we just got more whales, not more players.
---
&gt;My question is whether they impart power or knowledge. Both can fade if the storage is damaged and the more powerful Zephyrites seem to be capable of using their abilities without a supply of crystals at hand, though of course they could drain the magic from said crystals and store it in their bodies.
---
All lore suggests that they get it from the crystals. Who's to say the masters aren't wielding crystals?
---
&gt; If Glint could impart control over magic she herself did not posess into her creations why not into her own body?
---
Like I said, based on the GW2 facets, they're all still using crystal magic. So there's no credible indication that Glint is imparting control over magic she doesn't not possess herself - or that's outside the domains of Kralkatorrik.
---
&gt; I was mainly thinking of the Destroyer Queen and potentially Thornhearts/other living mob spawners. Those are born "second generation" without any purification and to my knowledge show no diversification of magical attunements beyond what the ED itself was already capable of at the time.
---
Most dragon minions are corrupted via champions, so by your argument they'd be second generation minions. There isn't any fundamental difference between those corrupted by an Elder Dragon and those corrupted by their champions.
---
But we _do_ see a fundamental difference between purified minions and those "imbued" by purified minions. Apparent vulnerability to re-corruption, ease of using other magics outside the primary domains, lack of a hive mind, etc.
---
Also, no minion is "born", technically, just corrupted; dragon minions cannot procreate (obvious exception to the scions of Elder Dragons).
---
&gt; Basically I believe the purification is the hard breaking point which eliminates boundaries posed by the ED domains while you seem to think the creation of living offspring to be a necessary intermediate step.
---
Until we see the Pale Tree or Glint directly ever using magic outside the domains of the Elder Dragon, there's no reason to believe that purification in of itself allows mixing multiple domains of magic in them.
---
I'm not sure that you can count players that spend on the cash shop as more or less players. The income from the game largely comes from the cash shop. You can have more free to play players not spending money on the game and they wouldn't show up at all. It's still doing what every single MMO in existence does. Goes up in an expansion, gradually winds down into a sort of stability, until something major happens.
---
Finally someone's who isn't a crazy person
---
This sums day 2 : https://youtu.be/MztJKe_RASc
---
Personally, it is not so bad. If you will be able to actually follow what is happening, why you do the tasks and what it accomplishes, you will enjoy it. Finally we have some content that is on par of legendary weapon collections but not for legendaries and not with such huge money sink either. 
---
People are trying to optimize the fun out of the game, get everything as fast as possible, mindlessly follow the guides so they don't lose time...then they are pikachuface that they don't enjoy it.
---
LOL why did i bother responding with actual thought-out response to some shitlord.
---
&gt; every 2-3 months
---
I wish. Season 4 is constantly delayed. They can't keep up with schedules after zadorojny took over directing.
---
&gt; I'm not sure that you can count players that spend on the cash shop as more or less players.
---
A higher number of players spending a little is healthier for the game than few players and a ton of a whales. PoF sold less despite being cheaper than HoT, but quarterly earnings the living season rose. Since you need to PoF to play the season its clear that the already existing players started spending more (most likely due to mount skins) but that's not good for the game's long term health/population.
---
&gt; Goes up in an expansion, 
---
The issue is that the "up" part of the expansion is subpar at best and depressing at worst.
---
If that is literally the only thing you are logging in to do, and nothing else in the game is fun for you, I'd say you have bigger issues with the game in general than timegating on 1 mount. Maybe it's time to reflect on whether this is the game for you or not.
---
Doesn't need to be really difficult - the meta for this map is actually a perfect example of moderate difficulty with good rewards. We just need that kind of content in greater quantity so it doesn't get worn out like Silverwastes, Istan, Tarir, etc. Imagine if Gandara had a similar 3 lane meta
---
Legendary’s are all about mats. After map exploration you’re going to have to farm for awhile.
---
&gt;They are way more costly because they all use the same mats, which reduces supply with a high demand.
---
No, they are more costly because they factually cost MORE materials to make. If they go back and add additional effects to the old legendaries (especially custom attack animations for each class like exordium has, which is a ridiculous complaint for OP to have) then that delays us getting a potential third set. This thread is beyond stupid.
---
&gt; Now i want to know do i need some materials "how i get them 
---
Depents if you build a legendary with a collection or if you can just throw gold at it
---
&gt;  It is hard do get materials 
---
No
---
&gt;   Do i need do something else? 
---
As been said some Legendaries require a collection   
---
4 to be precice
---
&gt; Is there some other way to get legendary stuff's?? 
---
Trading Post
---
I actually thought on it today now that I'm at the raising skyscales steps, and I realize I would not really care much for the collection if it wasn't timegated like it is. Since there's only so much I can do "for now", I don't truly rush through it all now that the meaty first step is done.
---
If anything, the issue was having so much to do in each time-gate, so it feels like you need to rush through those huge portions to ensure you can continue at a timely manner. At first I thought the extra four days for the raising skyscales was stupid, but thinking back, I kinda wish the first step had a time-gate halfway through or something.
---
The only real issue I see is the charged quartz crystals, since so many are needed which is uncommon.But at least the Pieces of Skyscale Food isn't account bound as that means you can either buy it or get some from guildies who stockpile Charged Quartz. I was lucky and had 57 on my main account and another 28 on my alt, so I had plenty to make for myself and to sell off to make a some gold.
---
I'd be careful at judging elite specializations just from watching videos.  Get them in your hands eventually and play them, test them out first-hand.  They generally add new options rather than taking things away.  Thief is a small exception to that since both elite specializations modify Steal, but if you're still early in the game, I'm not sure how often you're really using Steal, in my experience I find that new Thieves are more focused on their weapon skills than Stealing. ;)
---
With Daredevil, your Steal loses half its range in exchange for a powerful, cleaving/AoE melee weapon option.  With Deadeye, your Steal changes its functionality to remove the teleport effect and add damage to your stealth attacks, and also gives you a powerful long-range single-target weapon option.  But remember, the new weapons are options.  You can still wield your daggers and pistols and swords with the elite specializations.  If you're seeing videos of the staff and rifle being used and just don't like how they look, you can simply not use them.
---
Yes, though it still counts as an example where core thief can be used in end game content, granted its not as good as other classes in the same role.
---
Yeah that was the problem, thank you
---
That worked, thank you
---
Ahai, outlander! Let me know if you need help getting your bearings.
---
Nice strawman but no ;) 
---
Since I've done all there is I don't log in for multiple days at a time in between LWS as stated in my original post. It's the game my dear, not me. If I didn't like it I wouldn't be playing it at all now would I? 
---
cheers
---
Well argued and I agree, for the most part.
---
My frustration came really from the boiling it down to '1 or 2 hrs of content every x number of months', which is patently untrue and paints the wrong picture of what the game has to offer.
---
I'm in no way saying it's perfect, I could bang on for ages about the things I think need addressing with the game (frequency &amp; volume of content being one), but the whole 'not content I want = there's no content in the game full stop' thing really gets to me. 
---
tldr; I should really stop reading in-game map chat.
---
That is a deus ex machina, not a mary sue
---
I both hate and love you
---
I think it's worth noting that Ecto prices have dropped more since Dragonfall launched than they did during the World Boss week, where each world boss was giving an extra rare and large numbers of players were following the train hoping for infusions.
---
It probably had less to do with Zad and more with the fact that we had a skeleton crew working on those LW releases.
---
&gt; iridescent
---
Yeah, that was the word I was looking for. Ty !
---
exactly, funny how if they added an additional timegate between the scale and egg collection it would be better paced
---
If you factor in all the soulbound materials and things you can't buy on the tp it is easily that much..
---
They're not bad collections! Their execution is what's bad, if it wasn't so exhaustive I'd still be attempting to get a skyscale.
---
For #6, if you don’t have the skyscale I recommend using the springer to jump up the cliff behind the shrine and flying the griffon over to the Hydra.
---
Are you suggesting he tries nuclear fusion with his grandpa? What if they explode?

His mom would be so pissed if it doesn't turn him into an elder dragon

Yes you can, for about 2k gold [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Exclusives_Chest]. I only have about 300g.

Well done
---
Atoms do not store memories and feelings like magic does.
---
Our universe just has 12 particles of matter and 4 forces of nature to work with. So someone who goes around saying things like "Water has memory" should get sent to a mental institution. But in Tyria there's also magic, and that allows things like portals , fractals, the dream, and the VOED.

That ain't Mary Sue fam and he didn't consume her magic.

Hi! player from the beta returning back  to the game(left just after season 1 ended).
---
I have a questions:
---
How the living world season 2 access works? 
---
 I've read you cannot play that anymore(without paying) but when I logged in yesterday I had "The dragon reach part 2" mission active ( i guess that it were i left) . But I was able to finish it and then started "Echoes of the past" and did some missions. Why I'm able to do that content?
---
most of the recent maps haven't had metas worth repeating, this map is better in that regard.
---
Tehnically we aren't commander, Logan is now. In one of the stories they told us we can keep the title just cuz everybody is used to calling us that. Currently we are GM of Dragon's Watch which is a 7man guild I believe (8 if you include rox who is likely leaving).
---
You answered your own question. It’s a POI with the same name as an existing POI and it disappears when you get to it. It seems pretty clear to me that it’s a leftover from when they were designing the map and the Verdance Falls POI was moved from the Wing to the Falls.
---
Ah c’mon
---
Naw Logan Thackery, I think he tells us during that LWS3 episode where we kill Caudecus. He tells us something like he's been offered the position when we turned it down and he will take it because he doesn't wanna be the Queen's lackey anymore
---
adorable isn't gameplay. Now I just connect to harvest crystal on my home node and transmute 25 into 1 charged. That means I can average 1 to 2 meal a day which means I'm around 5 days away from the step 3. Imagine having to do this shit for 5 fucking days. I do my T4s too but that doesn't take too long. Right now I'm doing the hardmode quest of the Ministry of Purity in GW1 and that's the worst thing I've ever done but at least it's gameplay.
---
How's that "wait a few seconds till you can boost" thing going on, hm?
---
Birds and their superior eyes can see insects like you fail from far above the clouds.
---
Really? I thought Logan was Pact Marshal, aka Trahearne's job. Might be a mistake on my side though.
---
But extending on my point, I think the Pact story is finally done, and we can go do Adventuring.
---
No thats very easily recognizable as mordremoth.
---
Dont let him win artist!
---
Found it myself.
---
I don't think they will stop. It's an integral part of the economy and a big draw for players. 
---
I do wonder what we will get in terms of relation to the content for pof and moving forward!
---
...
---
&gt;are immune to market shifts, thus are more valuable than the gold you could get from selling them
---
This really isn't how it works. You can easily lose potential gold by hoarding things that will go down in price.
---
But it also doesn't have anything to do with charged quartz anyway, it isn't directly tradeable (shortsighted peopel are lucky that collection only requires them indirectly) and always have value in form of daily cd spent.
---
This has literally nothing to do with what I was referring to.
---
Additional information should be added in the same ticket.
---
But when you add additional information, your ticket will be moved to the end of the line and you have to wait longer.
---
Thus you should only add information if it is really necessary, as you will otherwise just increase your waiting time.
---
... Like what?
---
|Collection Part|Gold Value|TP Cost|
---
|:--|:--|:--|
---
|Skyscale Scales|0|0|
---
|Skyscale Medicine|100 VM, 5 Mistborn Mote, 5390 Karma|0|
---
|Skyscale Eggs|0|0|

|Skyscale Fever|0|0|

|Saving Skyscales|Waypoint cost I guess?|0|

---
|Skyscale Toys|6G + Grow Lamp|39g88s86c instant buy at time of this post|
---
|
---
|**TOTAL**||**85g35s78c** if you instant buy|
---
And this is with the prices still being inflated. As time goes on, the Grow Lamp will normalize back to the 8-12 gold range it was at for ages, I expect it to be under 20 by the end of the month or around then.
---
If you paid nearly 600g for the 12 food + grow lamp, that is 100% on you for paying the impatience tax. If you had just bought 2x Food + Grow Lamp on the first day and crafted your own Charged Quartz, you would have saved a lot by comparison. If you just buy 2 + craft 1 food per day you'll still be in a way better place than if you bought it all at once.
---
From your first reply:
---
&gt;Whenever you update your ticket, it gets pushed back to the end of the waiting list. Just FYI.
---
... Is wrong. It doesn't get pushed out. That's what I was saying.
---
So with the "What's Next for Guild Wars 2" they said that they had plans for legendary sigils and runes. I imagine that those will be next before another weapon set.
---
&gt;The rune and sigil salvaging release last year was in anticipation of releasing legendary runes and sigils—the final components of legendary core equipment.
---
My personal hope for their plans is to:
---
* Release Coalesence next raid wing.
---
* Add a two amulets, two accessories, two aquabreathers, and two rings afterwards.
---
* Add a trident, spear, and harpoon gun afterwards (so we have two+ of every weapon type).
---
* Add a recipe to upgrade Mistforged Obsidian and Mistforged Heroe's weapons into legendary weapons, similar to the recipes for the armor sets.
---
That way, there's at least two ways to get any particular legendary ranked gear for every slot. Only then do we need a third method really.
---
I personally hope they update gen1! Doesn't take a whole lot of time and would make a lot of people happy with new shiny textures and higher quality effects!
---
Aye aye captain

You should only create the f2p account so that you can buy the expansions now with the 50%-off-deal, assuming that you can not access your main account at the moment.
---
Once you have access to your main account, register the code with the expansions on your main.

The F2P account is literally just so you can buy the code now with the discount. I wouldnt advice you to start over, if you have characters on your main account.

The first stage is skyscale collection IS trash, tho. Doing a random scavenger hunt 3 times in a row on the same map, well, I don't know who is this for, it is worse than ubisoft levels shit.
---
After that it gets better, places you need to go get some context and are easy to indentify (questmarks were excessive, but they have shown that anet actually has "questmark" technology now), and there are some visible consequences to your actions. Still pretty much a recycled content but for this game it is ok.
---
It gets pushed to the back of the waiting line, just as if you created a new ticket. 
---
I cant search for it atm since im on mobile, but there has been some official response from support gm's regarding this here on reddit.
---
Oh yeah me too. From the long tusks, to the greenish-red eyes, Mordremoth has many unique features that make him stand apart from the other Elder Dragons. The most recognisable thing about this comic, however; is his indomitable will over the sylvari that really reflects that in 1327 AE, Mordremoth attacked the Mother Tree in the Grove, meaning he could attack us anywhere.

Curing cancer? There is nothing more important than looking fabulous. *hair flip.
---
Wait, they are? I missed the announcement for that I guess :o
---
This.
---
Yes, but did you read the fine print that says, “GIVE UP... your soul to me.” ;) Nice touch.
---
Thats a 7 year old tweet. What i am referring to, is what Gaile updated few months ago.. and is available in their website

Not quite. It might well be content you personally don't find compelling, but it is still content, there for others to try, whether they enjoy it or not. 
---
There's definitely content I don't find particularly compelling, but I do still acknowledge that it is content, it just isn't for me.
---
I thought ls3 was fine but the maps once done are done and not much reason to return. I loved bitterfrost and that map was amazing but there were no reasons to return  once you finished it, even with the meta. 
---
PoF maps were great visually, I still find them engaging but there are no reasons for daily returns like the HoT maps. Ls4 has picked back up but it's not quite there yet. Dragon fall is definately a step in the right direction.
---
The dismount mastery skill (bond of faith was it?) negates fall damage
---
This is an interesting side effect of the lack of a gear treadmill in the game. The longer the game has existed, the more people that will reach a place where they have all the gear they really want or need. Those people might be excited about a legendary but are also likely to have been saving mats or gold since the last thing they were excited about, so it's not a huge grind for them. The map is new but not terrible necessary, so they will be interested in the new meta for a while but then get bored. And people with established fashion may not care much about new gear skins.
---
The question is what kind of new content would actually appeal to players like you? If you're done gathering gear, gold, and glory, what else would you be interested in actually seeing in a release?
---
I hope that we can put little UI icons for every saved build, so we don't have to open the hero panel and use a tab in there.
---
Since you're new to the game, I'd recommend just enjoying it first! Crafting legendaries require a whole lot more (time, effort and gold) and it would be better to get to know the game before you delve into that.
---
Although if you want to get the gift of exploration while you're at it, sure you can go for it. But get comfortable with the game before you do.
---
That's kind of dumb if we're gonna be honest.
---
Not saying I don't believe they are, but that's kind of dumb.
---
yes that's the content we deserve
---
[I'll just leave it here](https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot/clip/StupidTastyCurlewBudStar?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time)
---
"Thanks!"
---
I'd personally love much more character bound content in the game. I have 12 alts because it's so ridiculously easy to level them up and gear them for lvl 80 content, but I'd much prefer having to put some real thought in to levelling &amp; gearing an alt because it's a genuine investment, and further one that comes with appropriate reward.
---
I'd argue for a game that's primary endgame for most player consists of fashion, making back items dye-able would be a pretty big and important change.
---
enabled by default, so if they turned it off they should know about it's existence
---
I am not talking about the first stage.
---
Oh look, another flat drawing completely devoid of depth.
---
white pussy soy tears are best :DDD
---
Good shots, especially that second one. As a WvW player I might have to take a break to look at the map. Not really drawn in by the mount.
---
Seriously.  The Charged Quartz kerfuffle aside this step is really cute.  If there weren't several hours of collections in front of it - if, say, you just finished the story and it was all yo we found an egg let's hatch it and went right into this - it would have been a super cute little daily and a great design.
---
Lessons learned I hope.
---
*feels rich*
---
Does this require Nvidia Experience?
---
The more gw2 comics, the better imo \o/
---
They're missing on so much money by not doing this :I.
---
if they use LS5 for that; while setting up another expansion; they can have three new underwater legendaries as part of the Great Big Ocean expac.
---
It is bugged for me, I can't get the achievement even if I kill it
---
Yesssss pls
---
For me all they had to do is make it so you can charge a quartz on Tyria, one on maguuma and another in elona, so you'd have 3 each day. 1 week time gate as opposed to 22 days
---
No love for the Underworld?
---
I feel personally attacked, actually, seeing your username.
---
Right, because it's a mount.  Making a mount expensive already had it's run with the Griffon, now with the Skyscale as well considering the Lamp and Food costs.  Make a Legendary Weapon or whatever expensive, no one gives a crap because that's how they have been for the last 5 years--Legendary for a reason, very hard to get.
---
This is literally just a mount, something that was created because they believe it would have been popular as a Dragon -- something a lot of players asked for.
---
&gt; I spent a very long time trying to figure out what colors would work for it. I made probably about 40 color variation mock ups and found that I was in fact quite limited in my options. 
---
Why don't you just release three versions for each legendary weapon, with different color variations? Would quell the cries for dyeable weapons, and make legendaries easier to mix and match.
---
Great work with the greatsword, by the way :D.
---
Point up a bit and you'll be in ochs!
---
Although this is true, some of the one and done content is pretty remarkable, like the Mastery system. In fact, I still visit sun's refuge (Jk it's for the newest mount collection)
---
I’m currently working (very slowly) towards my legendary raid armor. I have about 6k+ VM. I don’t know why but I’ve been hoarding. Would you recommend dumping it all into selling mats? I have about 630 gold as well. I’m pretty far from starting my armor though - still finishing off a couple parts of first collection. I asked you since you seemed familiar with selling. I used to do it from Istan but not sure if Dragonfall is similar? Seems like Dragonfall gives piles more VM.
---
It's called Bond of Vigor!
---
Search for "Killing Kralkatorrik".
---
Oh... that's odd. I really enjoyed the scavenging, specifically avoided using a guide while doing it too and got most of the events I needed done in the process. Was mucho fun :3
---
I donated 50 to one of my guilds a few weeks back, because I had no need for them. I guess I should never share then?
---
Was tedious, but I happy with the result given the scale I was working with.
---
&gt; They weren't even close to the timegated part at that point.
---
Okay, then what were you talking about?  Because the first time-gate happens immediately after you finish the First Collection.
---
For me personally, a raid has 0 hours of replay value because I won't even play it the first time. A story instance or map meta, for you, has very little replay value. I prefer metas, story, collections, and open world content, you prefer raids. Your idea of repeatable endgame content doesn't appeal to everyone, and neither does mine, but you don't see me complaining every time they release a raid or fractal instead of more open world stuff.  
---
I do wish collections were repeatable though.
---
As one of the few Sharur owners can confirm its pretty great. Only thing I wish it had was the draw effect during the day being carried over to the nighttime (keeping the death tentacles ofc) or a more complete feeling nighttime draw effect. The tentacles and claws just kind of grow and appear which is cool, but I feel it should have been a little more extravagant on draw for nighttime.
---
Unfortunately, I did know about these chests, but they're very expensive now. I'm not sure how much real money I'd need to spend for 2k gold, but certainly more than a casual skin is worth.
---
I now have an alt stationed at one of the safe VB hero point pillars, inv full of stacks of quarts crystals. His sad existence will now be his daily log in to charge one. I have learned my lesson, you can say.
---
Me too i wish only we could take it out and train as that dog we can buy.
---
Did you know that German kids get their christmas presents on December 24th instead of the 25th like the rest of the world? You must be furious now.
---
...The point of the post was mainly to ask other people what they thought? But thanks I guess.
---
FB can be paired with either a chrono or ren for alacrity, and yes, it absolutely is chaos chrono 2.0. Saying otherwise just means you're unaware of how many things it can do atm.
---
You could literally use that argument for *any* material - no, anything that has a cost.
---
It's like I would spend all my money on vanilla ice cream, and get disappointed next week when there's some new flavor I'd rather have but didn't know about before so I get mad at the ice cream manufacturer for not telling me I should have saved my money.  
---
Now, I'm sure we could all agree that this would be quite silly.
---
My point is, what you do with your materials is up to you. If you used it for something else, complaining about not having it anymore is almost absurd.
---
I... just press space when my endurance bar is full. Don't know what could be different between us
---
Except legendaries (and ascended) ARE timegated, unless mithrillium/elder spirit residue/elonian cord/weaving thread suddenly stopped being timegated since I made my daily allotment last night.
---
\*Something something\* timegate, \*something something\* QQ..
---
Pharus is amazing! Not sure what the hate here is, it's clean, sticks to a theme,  animates really smoothly, and it's also not OTT with its effects (which reddit historically hates).
---
A lot of pug warriors are unaware of this, but even without PS a ren/fb should be able to average at least 15-18 might between Heroic Command and the might from quickness mantra.
---
Ahh the dice roll that is reddit. I figured it was only a matter of time before someone else threw up another one. 
---
Not to be cocky or anything but I’m fairly confident that my route is faster ^^ 
---
The path to 9 can be significantly shortened by waypointing and taking the lava tube and the skyscale stuff at 6 is definitely less efficient. 
---
Thanks for linking my post though, it’s very appreciated!
---
It's not JUST fiddling with the UI ((which is technically part of gameplay, also the fact that UI stands for "User Interface" should tell you something about its relationship with the term gameplay), but also the increased possibilities and strategies that you're able to employ by having access to every stat type in the game.  
---
I don't think your hypothetical situation is relevant here, because it fundamentally alters how the game of GW2 is played by completely changing the rules.  Gearing/Buildwork/etc. is a core component of GW2's gameplay.  If my friend spends several hours coming up with builds (which includes the changing of stats, etc.) he's most certainly playing GW2 and experiencing the gameplay of GW2, just like character creation/upgrades/gearing/etc. is core gameplay for games like D&amp;D as well
---
As you said, 12% damage difference. 
---
The theory goes: a good thief with a good team doesn't need to rely on extra sustain, so they can go full DPS all the time
---
In practice, that's not always how it works. Your healer might not be amazing, you might be dodging incorrectly, you might have aggro when you shouldn't, etc.
---
I'd rather see a million Lord Farens running around than one more fortress pauldron set.
---
you can descend pretty fast on Skyscale with mount skill 2, which is by default bound to either C or V I think. Same key you use to drift on Roller Beetle anyway
---
I enjoyed doing the griffon and beetle collections with a guide at my own pace. I like working on a collection for hours at time instead of breaking it into a month-long waiting game (charged quartz plus other timegates).
---
Just let people rush the content if they want to, it doesn't stop others from doing it at slower pace.
---
&gt;It's not JUST fiddling with the UI (which is technically part of gameplay, also the fact that UI stands for "User Interface" should tell you something about its relationship with the term gameplay), but also the increased possibilities and strategies that you're able to employ by having access to every stat type in the game.
---
You still have yet to awnser what kind of game you would have without gameplay. 
---
I've already proven by point by pointing out that you can have a game with combat and without equipment screens.
---
Everytime I ask you to do the same you beat around the bush.
---
&gt; but also the increased possibilities and strategies that you're able to employ by having access to every stat type in the game.
---
Which you can already do if you have multiple ascended sets. 
---
&gt; I don't think your hypothetical situation is relevant here, because it fundamentally alters how the game of GW2 is played by completely changing the rules.
---
You mean like PvP already does by standardizing gear options for everyone?
---
I agree. As long as anet doesn't nerf it, I think we finally have a worthy contender for the title of "Silverwastes 2.0".
---
I'm speaking from a PvE standpoint. 
---
In PvE, thief is one of the easiest professions to survive on.  Especially once you unlock daredevil. You have an insane amount of evades, signet of malice, invigorating precision if that's not enough yet. Getting more health is just a crutch, and won't teach you to use active defenses properly. And the loss of damage adds up quickly in longer fights. Just stick with berserker gear and use your active defenses better.
---
"If you don't enjoy the game the same way I do maybe it's time to reflect on whether this is the game for you or not"
---
You chopped down all those trees with a sword?!  Typical noob mistake.  Buy logging axes instead, it’s much easier.
---
Mordremoth speaks to us all!  We are his children!  All hail the jungle dragon!
---
This is why I don't use the jump boost unless I have a full charge.
---
12% is a pretty big difference. I don't think the loss of damage is worth it, considering how easy it is to avoid damage on Thief. Just work on increasing your skill instead of increasing your hp,
---
Ah I see, I'm kind of a scrub and wasn't aware of this. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Yeah it feels really nice seeing this arc end finally, just makes me wonder what the new arc is going to be.
---
How long before some crazy person beats raids/fractals on that thing and makes the rest of us embarrassed?
---
It’s either Commander or the Grand Poobah.
---
thank you so much for all your hard work o7
---
My pleasure:-)
---
Polymock.
---
Mini pets also just... Ackwardly fly there.
---
this is actually pretty good and kilometers better than "been playing for half a millenium and just got world completion" posts
---
Same -- I didn't have as many as you, but I've made charging a quartz part of my daily routine for quite a while now, because hey you never know when you might want to make a set of celestial in the future, right?
---
Nice to have it work out for something new and entirely unexpected!
---
Well people have been claiming that the story is great all the time so that is nothing new. Lets just say some people have differing opinions on that  ...
---
I have answered you; I don't think your hypothetical scenario is relevant to the discussion.  I understand the point you're trying to make, but it's honestly just a strawman because the "combat in a vacuum" argument makes the game fundamentally different than GW2 and is also not what I'm arguing at all.  
---
PvP standardizes gear, sure, but pvp is also fundamentally different than Ascended vs Legendary in PvE and WvW, so it's also irrelevant.  I'm talking, _specifically_ about the impact of legendary items on gameplay _in pve and wvw._  
---
There are other aspects to gameplay than just combat.  Gearing etc. and the strategies that being able to swap gear freely allows for is also part of gameplay.  Full stop.  You refuse to acknowledge this point which is why you refuse to see how Legendary items affect gameplay.
---
thx. very bad gamedesign for a collection achievement.
---
i have everything done on the map and only 2/10 bridges. 
---
Events where you have the camp an area ist is just fucking bad game design.
---
What armour skin is your chest-piece here?
---
They are defective sylvaris.
---
It will be like legendary gear.
---
There are players that play more than one character and will find extra sets  of ascended gear useful until they obtain all of the builds they want or if a balance patch changes things.
---
Then there are players that play one character and only one character so if they get legendary gear then any extra ascended they have or get becomes useless to them even if a balance patch changes things.
---
And of course, depending on the cost to craft a legendary rune or sigil, someone who plays lots of different characters might not even bother with legendary runes and sigils.
---
I myself have bought an endless upgrade extractor. It's done. It's account bound. That decision has been made. There's no going back. Whether it turns out to be a good choice or bad choice for me is largely irrelevent to me because I can't undo that. If it becomes obsolete in the future then it becomes obsolete in the future.
---
Heck now that I think about it, even if legendary runes and sigils end up being super expensive, the upgrade extractor, if anything, will give me the option to craft them anyway despite me playing lots of characters because I could just extract them and move them to a different character (but if I'm honest I'd be way too lazy to do that anyway lmao).
---
If you’re objectively measuring content by sheer replay hours, a map with a compelling and rewarding meta like this adds wayyyy more than instanced content does.
---
Like, as much as I can’t wait for w7 to come out, it will only add a total of 20-30 minutes of playable content per week.  A new fractal would add about maybe 30-40, depending on if you do rec’s everyday or just t4’s, and how it fits into the daily rotation.
---
Like if you only do the new meta once a week, that’s already four times the amount of game time as clearing a raid wing (after the first two weeks of learning curve or so.)
---
Ahhh, Its so cute!
---
**Lets Kill it!**
---
Next expansion won’t be announced until late this year I’d imagine. We still need to get through living world season 5.
---
You're forgetting all time wasted on waypointing and waiting for half squad to catch up.
---
That's certainly the quickest way to do it, I guess.
---
I generally just take a stack to Prosperity Waypoint in Dry Top, flap up the mountain where the JP is, mine the two quartz nodes that are up there along the way, and use the Hero Point to make a charged quartz. Takes a minute or two, tops, and I get a small replenishment of my quartz and if the sandstorm is going I usually manage to pick up 2-4 buried locked chests while I'm there, too, without really going out of my way.
---
It's really nice to see a character drawing in some of the earlier armour!
---
Haha, that’s the armor I have right now :^)
---
Thank you!
---
Armageddon helmet with reading glasses. YES
---
Wasnt this posted yesterday?
---
Nooo the scavenger hunts were fun, too, and I like the feeling that I really had to earn my little egg. Just skipping straight to "hey you found an egg, hatch it" would have really diminished the entire experience in my eyes.
---
That said, I *do* understand that not everyone enjoys scavenger hunts as much as I do, so I suppose I can see the frustration there... but I would have been very sad if we had just skipped the collections. I live for collections.
---
Laughs in PvP titles
---
why would you want a mount unlock to be a long term goal lol, thats a game feature and mechanic. lege gs is just cosmetic skin. 
---
besides, 250g is not long term goal, if someone complains about sth costing 250g then they should not be taken seriously
---
I’m not gonna keep on drawing only GW2 fanart, sorry. But should you be interested in following my art progress here’s [my DeviantArt!](https://www.deviantart.com/fehlung)
---
&gt;   I feel like I'm missing a key bind that lets me descend like I can underwater. I currently press 1 until I'm close to the ground (not all the way down, obviously). 
---
I had the same problem. Skycale uses the first mount keybind. you can go down quite quickly with it.
---
Heart of thorns was announced at PAX South. Path of Fire was announced a month and a half before it was released(I think)
---
Imagine you're well-crafted enough that you could just casually draw your character from an MMO.
---
Every map has its own schedule and meta progress
---
Pretty sure it's a bug, I was on a full meta map that was apparently "empty" yesterday, but we had people in squad telling us they couldn't get in because the map was full
---
I mean, there'll always be complaints.  But give it a story reason - tie it into the story in a manner that's more meaningful than "you can gather goop from that one thing", and I think there's potential for some worthwhile payoff.
---
I was going to say Red Iris flowers from GW1, but I don't think that's it.
---
By using [Bond of Faith].
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bond_of_Faith
---
Make it a non-combat tonic novelty. Now no one runs around fighting eldritch abominations in bikinis and speedoes.
---
But then again, if Faren can do it, so can the Commander!
---
I'm sure clipping would be an issue especially with helms that cover the entire head, but a lot of things already clip anyway and I would think if 2 pieces clipped REALLY badly, people just wouldn't wear them together 🤷‍♂️
---
Gah! I should have known that. Thanks. I'm going to delete because this probably should have been in a discussion thread.
---
How about you give some useful advice, since you've got *so* much depth yourse- oh wait, no, you're just here to troll.
---
He uses Bound of faith Mastery.
---
yeah, but it was removed fairly quick because of a lack of spoiler tag. This time I added one
---
Maybe season 5 currency?
---
Great, now I want a Mini Kralkatorrik in-game. Damn you.
---
Still waiting on that Mini Zhaitan too.
---
This exactly. There's absolutely a work-around, which I think makes a lot of this crying moot.
---
If you don't want to buy the stuff, you can take extra time to make the charged quartz yourself (unless you had already stockpiled them, which many people obviously had, me included). If you don't want to wait, you can buy the food and it's not even really expensive.
---
That's a perfectly fine solution, IMO, and ANet designed it that way on purpose so that people could make that choice for themselves... but, of course, people are going to cry because they can't have their cake and eat it too (by stuffing the whole thing in their faces in a single day, no less).
---
Might be season 5 currency dropped in by error?
---
Oh dear.  Is this going to become a thing?
---
you can buy them on TP. only thing you are timegated with is gift of battle and crystalline ingots if you make gen2. but the huge cost of legendary is removing the pain of timegate - you can still play the game when you are timegated on those mats, to make money for other stuff you need for the lege. with this mount its just "you can only progress in 24h because we say so and nothing you can do about it"
---
Would be grand if someone could push this to the wiki too.
---
Am stealin' that name.
---
15-18 is not 25 so still thats on warrior
---
simply dont use a guide for it. lol.  its like you playing some kind of puzzle game, and end up writing a bad review about the game, because you went through it in like 30 minutes, because youve been watching a guide on your 2nd screen.  and if you dont like doing fetch quests simply dont do them ther is tons of different things to do.
---
I have a single toon with all professions maxed without buying the Additional Crafting licence, you can switch between them by talking to a craft master for 50 silver (if maxed) and you won't lose progress level. So anyone you choose is safe. But like VDRawr said armor and weapons if you don't want the other prof's , trinkets are pretty cheap on TP.
---
thanks
---
Yes there are poeple who don´t want to do nothing for it, I on the other hand like to do things to get something but I can´t do anything to get besides pressing 3 buttons a day and that is not fun.
---
do y’all hear sumn
---
I totally agree with all the "suck it up and play" comments above. I expected to have to earn this new mount. I love this game and find myself challenged at scavenging for things, but always surprise myself at how doable they are. Play the game and have fun. The complaints are getting old and I agree that Anet should keep on doing what they're doing. It's been fun seeing everyone running about collecting stuff and helping each other. It's a GAME!!!
---
Thing is, those are mutually exclusive. The story is great (subjective, but still). The map is amazing are arguably the most cohesive map we've had. They needed to do this more over all the maps so these map mechanics stop feeling like a one-and-done thing. ANet did a phenomenal job on that. The armor looks great, it's easy to acquire via normal playtime.
---
The skyscale collection is also fucking terrible and exhausting. The real problem is the inclusion of charged quartz crystals. Imagine this. Imagine the exact same collection, but there's another couple food recipes using Fulgurite or Vision Crystals instead. People who have tons of charged quartz? They're golden. People who have shitloads of HoT mats? Golden. People who are drowning in ascended mats? You get the picture. Instead, they went with a time-gated material. I'm guessing because it's the first/only magically-charged material they could think of.
---
1. Story was medicore at best and the map meta is awful.
---
2. Skyscale timegate literally doesnt matter people who want it get it anyways
---
Pof didnt sold less. it generated nearly the same amount of money as HoT with a *lower* price (30 bucks instead of 50).
---
so it sold more copies than HoT.
---
You're mostly porting between zones; Grenth is the zone I like porting for the most but you could easily do a sweep;
---
helps if you actually use its jump ability
---
Nice, I especially love the detail on the armor! Chain and scale armor isn’t the fastest thing to draw and get right, I can imagine ahah
---
Fairly well is an understatement :o
---
I once got 500-500 in ranked and then a message appeared something like "first team to do (something idk) wins".
---
I did something similar
---
It generated less money than HoT with a lower price. 
---
Shouldn't the game's popularity be actually growing to the point where a cheaper future expansion draws enough players in to surpass the previous one?
---
seriously?
---
It would warm my necromantic heart to see Rurik, the Suicide Prince, crawl up out of the ground and claim the weapons.
---
&gt; shows up with both swords the Foefire shall be lifted
---
It would be very interesting to see how they handle it. On one hand, there is a great deal of open racism between human and the Charr NPCs, but if a Charr were to cleanse the curse put on there by his/her side... It would be nice to see it become a fully functional city again, but to do that, they would have to either have instancing like in WoW or wait for the eventual GW3.
---
thanks :)
---
:) ok
---
To me, this just points out yet again how some parts of the game are still broken and ignored. I have too much to say on that topic, so I will just say this. Anet, either time gating or account bound, choose one. I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped the game because a 'cool goal' I wanted to achieve required charged crystals, a resource BOTH time gated AND account bound. No other games I have played have made me feel looked down upon like this game has, with all these stupid restrictions.
---
Good point. Tried doing that more today got a lot more keys
---
My take on that is like soldiers in Afghanistan when they come back and think of their squad as family. They went through hell together, came out the other side and forged a bond that's almost as strong as brotherhood.
---
He is making a dumb argument. "Others have it worse, so we can't complain.".
---
"Running around in circles and pressing F" is not fun, it is not engaging, it is tedious, dull, boring, uninspired, and stupid.
---
np. also note that those comps are for pve and fb/ren both have options to be boon/healers or hybrid boon/dps
---
Try making an actual piece then instead of looking for pity.
---
Wiggle to the skies on the new Iboga-scale, the very first Skyscale skin, available now for 2000 gems through the Black Lion Trading Company!
---
There's Dhuum at the end of a raid isn't there? You could take the pieces to the fight, which would also give Anet a way to make sure there are enough people doing raids that more people can get through them.
---
That is the "problem".. bit too many possibilities... I'll do some googling them.  One more thanks :)
---
This is a one time achievement.
---
I don't believe there is a way to turn effects off. Particles too.
---
The season 2 achievements can only be done on a character who finished the story instance in question allready.
---
that's a great idea actually :)
---
many legendaries are very nice but don't always match the character you want to use them on, this would give 3 available themes, for not too much work, and sustain economy for quite a while.
---
What about Sunless in one hand and Aurene's in the other?
---
Si I can't get the key and the achievement at the same time?
---
I wouldn't be too hasty to blame the raptor, it seems to be user error for jumping instead of leaping, even with the limited endurance it would have made it. :P
---
Legendary weps seem to be done. Though I wouldn't mind if they polished some lesser used legendaries, such as Gen2 Torch and Claw of Khan-Ur.
---
Just gonna put that link in without a warning huh?
---
You're talking about the Pact Marshall, not Commander
---
True. Vindictus underwear sales are huge.
---
He did what he could, but it "wasn't enough" so OP used him to get himself higher, not matter what happens with the Raptor. Just like Mario do to Yoshi every time.
---
You just ruined my childhood.
---
You mean your comments?
---
Oooh, do more of these drawings! Your character is great!
---
Sure it is pretty quick, so that's good. But it still feels like a bit of an oversight, much the same as how our EXP bars were locked until another patch reopened them once starting the Skyscale collection.
---
And I guess it's just a going forward thing. Imagine if you had to run through the entirety of PoF for the Griffon Roosts to show during unlocking that? A future LW episode might be several hours to run through and these Roosts/nests for a potential future mount might require 3+ hours to use per character. That'd be a bit much.

As a newbie the teal most could be very helpful for you.
---
If you find yourself in any situation where you're doing a lot of killing (I'm talking events with masses of bad guys) then pop it and devote the next 30 minutes to mindless slaughter. With any luck you'll rack up a nice pile of gold.
---
I feel indifferent on it. If possible I'd like to keep this thread positive. I'm very tired of hearing complaints and I didn't develop this achievement. 😃
---
Sbubbles ragm flag'm.
---
there you go, Anet.
---
Though I do agree that berserker is better (mostly because that damage difference adds up a lot in a long fight), I strongly disagree with this "the extra hp doesn't matter" logic, and I see it used all the time.
---
Several thousand HP will *absolutely* make a difference often enough that you'll notice. It's straight-up ridiculous to say that every single hit you get is always going to be hard enough to take you out regardless of whether you have 12k hp or 18k hp. Will that *occasionally* be true? Sure, especially against raid or fractal bosses, or legendary bounties, etc. But the vast majority of damage you take, as a player (and most players are spending most of their time doing content other than bosses), isn't coming in one giant hit from a boss's special mechanic. Most of the time you're taking a bunch of smaller hits from regular mobs, and -- especially for a class that can dish out a lot of damage fast, like a thief -- the extra second or two that extra 6k hp buys you can and absolutely *will* frequently make the difference between whether you kill the mob before it gets those extra hits in.
---
It's definitely better to practice using active defenses, being situationally aware, killing things faster, etc. -- I'm not disputing that. Berserker is absolutely better for a thief, because a 12% (or whatever it is) difference in damage is almost certainly more useful than the extra hp. But if we're going to make that argument, we should at least make it with good reasoning, not false and/or exaggerated reasoning.
---
I'd love to see a pvp match where everyone is using this.
---
Laranthir is still second in command of the Vigil and will replace Almorra as leader upon her death or stepping down (and it seems unlikely Almorra will be stepping down until all Elder Dragons are dealt with; I was kind of expecting her to die in a heroic sacrifice in Ep6 but it seems ANet wants to save her for a later campaign).
---
Logan has taken Trahearne's job as Pact Marshal. During our absence from the Pact, Trahearne had multiple Pact Commanders working for him like Commanders Quentyn and Frostgullet, but we don't know who's currently serving as Logan's right hand Pact Commander in the current Pact, if he even has any.
---
I was hoping for a storyline where the new Pact Commander would've blamed our Commander for stepping down when the Pact needed us the most (and thus voicing the opinions of many Pact soldiers who were disheartened in HoT ambient dialogue when the Commander barely stopped by to check on them) and for getting so many Pact killed in a haphazard plan to lure Kralk to Thunderhead Keep. The new Commander could've become a heroic foil to our Commander, showing someone who believes in the Pact and views our actions as treasonous or at least incompetent and perhaps even voicing an opinion whether Aurene can be trusted due to her affecting our Commander's mind. It seems unlikely we'll be introduced to the new Pact Commander anytime soon unless the writers address it in the future.
---
We still haven't even heard of repercussions of Logan's decision to defy Pact brass and the backers' orders (from Season 3 Episode 1 where Almorra clearly stated the rules and which was why our Commander refused the offer to become marshal and stepped down instead) for the marshal to stay safely in LA to avoid a Trahearne scenario from repeating as Logan followed us to the front lines and risked his life many times. Realistically this decision, even if it resulted in a victory in the end, also led to great loss of life which could've been avoided, so the powers that be should be holding Logan accountable for these actions and punish him according to whatever rules of tribunal they're following. I don't expect the story to address this plot point at this point, but I'd love to be surprised if it's brought up in S5.
---
but it is. 1h later i'm on 8/10.
---
just running circles with my beetle to catch the events /fun
---
This is what they did. They talked about it on the last guild chat.
---
You do realize that there are a ton of time gates in the game right? Mainly used for reducing rewards.
---
Events have a time-gate by reducing your reward after you have done some.
---
Raids, Fractals, Dailies, crafting all have time-gates. Heck, even damn map boss events are time-gated.
---
he used it so much he ran out of endurance.
---
I think it would be a programming challenge, the number of armor slots didn't change since release. I think a lot of thinks rely on the way it is not. It's not just checking "Allow glasses" in the dev settings.
---
Normally the little folds tearing up the colored coating degrades the quality of origami like this, but in the case of Kralkatorrik, it adds to the effect, I think.

About 100 USD
---
Yeah...um...no? No sounds good.
---
Yeah, re-shade with a custom setup or gw2hook might work.
---
Perhaps you could ticket support and ask, who knows, they might consider a setting in the future.
---
One day...until then we can only hope for a random tater appearance in CD discord.

NPC Joko: "Who are you?"
---
PC Joko: "I am you, but better."
---
Thank you so much!
---
It's really just how much you understand the encounters. Some groups do no healers and just speed through everything, but will wipe every now and then. One healer is kind of standard for most occasions and if you just want the job done take two. Just cover all the offensive boons: might, fury, quickness, alac and you guys should be good.
---
Your possibilities gradually start to become limited in fractals as everyone gets better and understand that power is better than condi so the only stat choices available are like harrier/diviner/zerker
---
No, but how can you others sound ridicules and inflate your own ego if you don't exaggerated and attach contradictions on the end that no one has even said?
---
Good shout. 
---
I'm currently doing a tribute video for this episode, and will make sure to sync it better in that one!
---
I might remember this wrong? But Isn't it against terms of service or something like that to name your character based on someone from lore?
---
Seems like the only spoiler here is in the title :p
---
It’s an Anet dev.
---
Note that this guy has the ArenaNet tag. Meaning, he's an employee.
---
So the rules don't apply to them?
---
Griffon roosts are locked behind a collection, not a story step. Totally different mechanics.
---
Apparently you can buy traders keys from Rytlock in Thunderhead peaks but....I can't find him anywhere? Also, all the NPCs keep saying to go talk to Canach but I can't find him either. Any ideas?
---
Basically.
---
Also hi, it me.
---
There's an Anet logo next to the name, so methinks it's a dev account.
---
I see there is a lot to learn. So I just need to make my friends to chose a class and build they fancy and do some adjustements. Well not what they thought should happen :)

You’re suggesting the owners of the names can’t use their own names lol.

If anything it’s shielding the official name from regular players.

Turning off Post Processing eliminates the wavy screen effects caused by being drunk. It may also eliminate the wavy screen effects you're talking about.

I'm not suggestion anything, I'm asking a question.

Support restored a Titan's Vengeance I got in like 2013 (on accident, I wanted my ascended one back that I had deleted 2 weeks prior to the ticket), so anything's possible!

Go for it OP.

I honestly would've wanted a proper Dragonbrand map that rivals Orr or Dragon's Stand in atmosphere. Nothing has really come close to the thick atmosphere in eastern Ascalon.

The scavenger hunts were fun (well, the second set.  The 2nd scavenger hunt around Dragonfall going to the same places was eh and the 3rd tedious).  The feeding your pet dragon is fun.  Them both being part of the same collection is not fun.
---
Wack
---
Nope. You asked a question and I told you exactly why it's happening.

Absolutely great screenshots! Most players won't ever realize it when they're dashing around on their mounts but this really shows how much effort they've put into this!

Okay then.

I had to know it all along, that I would hate this episode. Killing Aurene in the 5th was... well unnecessary, but reviving her just in the first minutes? Srsly? It's the best you could do? Ok, it was crystal (lol) clear, that she would be resurrected, after all, she ate Joko. And... every character is just OK? No questions? No speaking to us about what had just happened?  
---
Ok... Fine... 
---
But simply turning Aurene is this Mary Sue? Just another Elder Dragon? Screw you, Arena net...

Mostly yes. There are a couple paths you will have some trouble finding people for. Notably Twilight Arbor Aetherpath and all of Arah.
---
You will probably have to make your own LFG posting though, rather than waiting for someone else.
---
Now let's identify its weak points.
---
Additional bank space costs gems and 1 additional tap is 150g or so. I don't see where this is disapointing. They don't force you to pay anything.
---
It was against the rules for a while, but I believe they relaxed naming standards some years back.  Don't think it applies anymore.
---
Wow those conversations must really dragon.
---
I bet your co-workers really chew you up.
---
Lmao
---
Do you have camera shake on? And if so why on a preview video.
---
I'd not say no effect whatsoever, just think about "what would jesus do?" (wwjd)
---
After they let us wear our backpacks while in shroud/other transforms pls
---
It matches even better than Aurene, Dragon Full of Light, which was probably meant for it.
---
So you think the rune and sigil market will still be there and always, just less than today?
---
You're missing the point.  It's not falling behind other people, it's literally falling behind by a day as in, this'll take an extra day because the player decided to skip out finishing this part today before reset.
---
The game has been out plenty long enough for players to sink a thousand hours and get burnt out on it.  New releases can re-energize the game by making what was stale new again, but we have been through a lot of LS releases now and that almost feels like part of the core experience and not something new and exciting anymore.
---
If you still enjoy the core play of the game this is a really good release.  The map-wide meta is a lot more engaging than any zone released recently, and the rewards of the new map are a lot better than anything we have seen recently.  They definitely closed out LS4 on a high note.
---
However, at least in my circles there are a lot of players fundamentally burnt out on the game that have kept playing for social / grinding out rewards / force of habit / not falling behind on the content reasons.  They are trying to not play all that much outside their corner cases - they log in to raid or for guild events or for their dailies and then log out.  
---
For those players the new LS chapters really are just an hour of story.  The time gate and collections on the sky scale are just annoying chores they don't really want to do, they just want to get the mount unlocked so they can get back to their routine and largely not play the game.
---
This map is so well done. Honestly my favourite thing about it, more than its design or visual appeal, is the music. The music that kicks in in the back half of the meta. So. Good.
---
Something that I almost ever see on build templates that I wish more had is the ability to add your own notes on them. It;s very useful to be able to do that, especially if you play on and off. You can record the general idea of the build, play tips, rotations, anything missing to complete it ect.
---
Though mainly I just hope we actually get it, it works without something stupid getting in the way and it's not a gem sink. After faffing about for years to add something that should have been from the start I don't have a lot of faith in Anets ability to make a decent build template.
---
Well, I only see two people, and two animations... both seem to be the same animation, GS4... however, one doesn’t have the ground aoe.... could be maybe gravedigger from the other necro.
---
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  For a long time, I wanted the permanent bank.  Kept waiting for a day to get it from a weekly black lion chest.  Then around a year ago or so ago I finally bought it for the thousands of gold on TP.  I wrestled with that idea for a long time.  But it was just as good as I imagined, even better.  I use it all the time and it's very easily worth it.  
---
The endless extractor costs in the same area.  I know immediately I won't use it like I do the bank.  I am a build crafter and experiment all the time.  But I have legendary armor for every weight class and am slowly getting it for every character.  I also keep a guild bank full of runes and sigils.  
---
However, unlike legendary armor, legendary weapons is not practical.  So I opt for ascended weapons and could use the extractor for that...but really only for the expensive sigils since I have dozens of all the rest.  So I would use it, the extractor, definitely, just not that much.  
---
In the profit market, my understanding is that is already full with others taking advantage, so it doesn't seem I can hope to make any money back.  
---
I guess I've been thinking about getting the extractor for a long time since it came out too.  But with the perm bank, I'm very happy.  Once I get this extractor...I'll use it less, a lot less.  And then if legendary runes and sigils come out and take away my use there then I may feel I wasted thousands of gold for very little.
---
However, I have been assuming legendary runes and sigils were removable!  You don't think they will be (without an extractor or legendary armor and weapons)?  If so, it means the extractor will continue to be useful for weapons for me (since I use ascended weapons).  I'll use it a good deal less, but not completely.  
---
For infusions, the 24 silver is fine and changing those would be something I rarely do.  
---
Sorry, lots of thinking out loud.  All in all, it seems I would be risking disappointment for myself in that it is not going to be like the bank.   I guess I'll wait longer at least until we get more information about the sigils and runes.  I would love to know when that will happen.
---
Thank you for giving me more to think on about this.
---
But it does remove “5 days” from the timer.
---
This really depends on what you’re doing... as dungeon meta involves DH/War stacking, fractals use FB/ren/war/dpsx2, sometimes druid/chrono/war/dpsx2....
---
I like how the post has a spoiler tag but the post title is the spoiler.
---
Didnt see that when I finished it.,..had a black screen until we were on the airship...rofl...
---
Awesome! Thanx👍😀
---
Glad to know that you can't read. Now get off with the stupid comment.
---
it's interesting to see the details they aged / kept as a frame
---
&gt; “5 from daily resets to access new collections” mate, it’s only 3 daily resets. When a collection is done, you wait a reset... on the fourth day you’re feeding it the first time. You gotta feed it 4 times, that means 3 resets after the first feeding, so grand total 6.
---
You finish the first collection then you wait until the next reset to unock the second collection. Total wait: 1 reset
---
You finish the second collection then wait until then next reset to unlock the third collection. Total wait: 2 resets
---
When you reach the third collection, you need to feed the skyscale 12 times, and you can only feed it 3 times a reset, so you need to feed it for 4 days.
---
First feed happens on day 3, (Total wait 2).
---
Second feed happens on day 4, (Total wait 3)
---
Third feed happens on day 5, (Total wait 4)
---
Fourth feed happens on day 6, (Total wait 5)
---
You need wait 24 more hours after fourth feed to unlock the next collection on day 7 (Total wait 6)
---
After you unlock the fourth collection and finish it, you wait until the next reset, day 8 (Total wait 7)
---
And finally you unlock the final collection. 
---
So, it takes 8 days in total and 7 resets, one less than I had calculated at first, unless I'm missing something.
---
And this is assuming of course, that collections 4 and 5 are timegate free.
---
Wait 1 more day for reset 6 That's 4 more days you need to wait, and after you're done, you need to wait for an ADDITIONAL reset to unlock collection four, then ANOTHER reset to unlock collection 5.
---
&gt;Also “shitload of gold” is kinda not true... 100g can be earned in just a few hours. There’s many things that are roughly 20g/hr... raids gives ya 100g roughly a week, daily fractals gives you 15-20... just doing daily t4 (not even the CMs) each time you’re timegated will cut the cost out, that’s only an hour a day.
---
"Bro 100 gold is easy, just farm raids bro", you don't think you're a bit out of touch with the average casual player this game is marketed towards?
---
Damn. This means a lot, thank you. What demon did you sell your soul to in order to get my dream career?
---
It's definitively a bug and it happened to me every time I ran the meta today, so 5 times in a row.  
---
The map was full, no one could join through LFG and still the prompt to switch map appeared. But overall not an issue, everyone listened to the call not to swap and we never had troubles to complete the meta.
---
thats a good thing imo.  I miss gw2 a lot :\
---
don't worry you'll get all the legendaries you want, just at the cost of ever having an expansion again.
---
And finally you finish collection 5 on day 9.
---
So, it takes 9 days in total and 7 resets, unless I'm misscalculating something.
---
If you got no charged quartz crystals you can add +22 resets to that since that's the number of crystals you need for the lamp and the feed.
---
"Bro 100 gold is easy, just farm raids bro", you don't think you're a bit out of touch with the average casual player this game is supposedly aimed towards?
---
what class/spec is easiest to do this with?
---
Its written that its for PvP and he played PvE. 
---
For exemple thief is VERY different on both. What the harassement?
---
Of course, i mean there's precedent to think so. I don't really think it will be much less either, if leg runes and sigils are as difficult to get as the rest of the legendaries.
---
god I realized I havent played this game in so long because I have no idea what a fb or ren is... im assuming banner is warrior
---
It's gonna die out in 2 weeks like pretty much anything.
---
Go to the resort at Southsun. You automatically switch to a bathing suit as long as you're in the designated area.
---
For instanced content such as fractals, the firebrigade: FB/War/Ren/Dps/Dps is pretty good! Covers boons and utility, while keeping dps up.
---
You can also use the tried and true: Chrono/Druid/War/Dps/Dps, boons, utility, decent group Dps!
---
Dungeons enjoy a quick setup of burst: Dh/War/Dh/Dh/Utility(or another War/Dh)
---
Open world is really the same as dungeons, unless ya want to burn metas, then try with fractal content.
---
Raids (Though 10man) employ the idea of 5man comps twice (typically the chrono setup) with sometimes stretching firebrand for things that hit 10 people.. though the dps varies between power fights or condi fights.
---
Might want to link to images directly instead of through the forum though

it’s honestly a good way to get the t6 mats for cheaper (unless u just need a few for smth specific )! and if u have extras of ones u don’t need for ur armor u can sell and buy the ones u do need

This is the best thing on the gw2 sub in weeks.

Lot only does it capture the situation perfectly but its also filled will lots of funny details.
---
The moment I arrived in the Old Command Post I really got hit by a wave of nostalgia. Really amazing.
---
&gt; The toys and treats are not timegated, so if those are the other collections you mention, those don’t count towards it.
---
Um.
---
You do realize that after "Raising Skyscales" part, there's still collection parts 4 and 5 right? Troublesome Skyscales and Riding skyscales?"
---
The entire collection is split into 5 parts.
---
Newborn Skyscales -&gt; Saving Skyscales -&gt; Raising Skyscales (This is where the food, toys and treats are) -&gt; Riding Skyscales -&gt; Troublesome Skyscales
---
You didn't know this?
---
&gt; flipping TP items. I could go on, but I care to not include ones I don’t personally do. I made 100g in a day starting at 50s before just playing with super simple quick flips in the TP. I’ve made 100g in 10 minutes from flipping. I’ve made 400g in three days just by crafting food and selling it.
---
"bro just flip the market bro, its really easy bro"
---
Really? This is your suggestion for casuals? Game the market?
---
&gt;Also, you seem to cherry picked that single statement, and overlooked the super casual t4 fractals, or the numerous other events that people just casually farm and have money stack up: silverwastes, Palawadan, fractal mai trin farm, 
---
100 gold is not a casual goal. Especially for people with day jobs and responsibilities. Not everyone can spend 6 hours in front of the computer grinding mai trin or silverwastes all day long.
---
&gt;You’re right, this game IS geared towards super casual people, however gold is literally thrust upon you EVERYWHERE!!! And doing JUST t4 daily fractals while waiting on this timegate, since people “have nothing else to do” will cover your food/lamp costs.
---
I got all the food and the lamp on day one when the collection who was unlocked was revealed.
---
The people who will be most hurt by this are the people who DO actually have things to do in the game.
---
Someone who hasn't finished all content in the game will have the least ammount of time to actually grind fractals and raids in order to get the money for the collection, and its unlikely that they will even be able to spare that money for a mediocre mount.
---
The toys and treats are not timegated, so if those are the other collections you mention, those don’t count towards it.

---
Honestly, a lot of people don’t realize that food is crafted in a bundle, and the cost of the mats to make a bundle of three is covered by selling one of them! Making the other two profit! Just, like, do ANY kind of research into gold or the game in general, and you can make 100g without trying hard at all!

With masteries you can jump with a hanging skyscale and regenerate some flight juice.
---
Gonna try out TERA after seeing that vid, lol
---
It's random and you cannot sell it. Good luck! :)
---
Comedy art as a parody..  can't go wrong.
---
&gt; I wonder if devs got a period to create characters before the game came out
---
Almost certainly, Most games do this.
---
You can't sell the unlock (it goes straight to your wardrobe) nor can you choose what you get. It's random. If you want the most value out of it, save it until you've unlocked all the cheap skins.
---
It’s an auto unlock that you don’t have in your wardrobe already. It isn’t a skin you can sell
---
The taller guy is performing two different animations. A spin, and one where he sticks his left arm out.
---
I have no idea what the latter is.
---
Jackal/Raptor/Bunny/Skimmer are tied to expansion progress - pretty much like Lily of the Elon invite, where your *account* needs to finish the first step of the expansion to be able to reach it/use it.
---
Skyscale is locked behind a story-step, which is probably different condition on Anet's programming.
---
this game has the same problem as many other games.  
---
new content is all nice and cozy, but it doesn't offer much to the veterans.  
---
for many it may be the familiy pizza with a shitton of toppings, but for the other crowd its just the small sized pizza magarita.

---
&gt;Btw, nice edit to add the “timegate” of the charged crystals, which is why the gold was brought up at all.
---
God forbid I bring up the number of timegates on a comment about timegates. 
---
Tera was literally saved from bankruptcy by the swimsuits.

---
Until we have a fully mastered skyscale we cannot really make conclusions, even less talk about so-called ‘proofs’
---
And they get to make more money at the end of the day as well.
---
I think to reach 6 there is a jackal portal just behind it which is easily reachable, no? Would be faster than skyscale.
---
it's an unlock for a skin, not a skin.
---
You switch to your own underwear, which is usually ugly as fuck.
---
Potential swimsuits would let players replace their underwear clothes.
---
It have been one time but then never again. The thing is i farm my keys. And when i had like 58 keys or so they swapped it out. That felt harsh :( 
---
Since then i been waiting for it to come another time but as you said it is in the chests now which also made me belive it will probably take a hundred more years before i get it.
---
Thanks for the info
---
&gt;1) Nah, that’s why I mentioned the treats/toys collection. So I redact that bit.
---
Do you think the 8 days it takes (assuming best case scenario with no more timegates on 4 and 5) is reasonable now that you know its longer than 6?
---
&gt;2) Once again, cherry picking select bits again mate. Read the entire thing! It was a single option to do, as some people do find it fun! Maybe they don’t like grinding some things and would enjoy a flip!
---
I only highlighted it because I thought it was funny that we're talking about casual players and you suggest flipping the market, when most of them won't even know what it is. I adressed the rest later.
---
&gt;3) 100g isn’t a SUPER casual gold, but it IS very obtainable with CASUAL play! You don’t need to spend 6 hours doing it either. As I mentioned, doing just t4 fractal dailies (the 3, not the CM or recommended) will net you 15-20g a day for a single hour of play. People don’t care what ya play as long as ya got pots. This will get you the gold by the time you need to feed it! An hour a day IS super casual! Or, you could run a meta or two of silverwastes. It isn’t hard, takes little brain power, can do easily with friends, and will net you quite a bit of gold each hour (roughly 20-30). You also neglected my mention of crafting food. Something that would take maybe 5 minutes to research, make, and place up. Then you go to sleep/work, and return with it sold! You can make a decent profit that way too.
---
I think you're either understimating the ammount of gold you make or you're taking into account the absolute best case scenario, the gains are high, but they are nowhere near that high per hour. Plus I wouldn't consider t4 fractals casual exactly.
---
&gt; In closing, it’s not super difficult, or trying.. but also, 
---
The issue isn't that its difficult, the issue is that its padded to absurd levels.
---
&gt;this mount isn’t NEEDED for anything! It HELPS, but it isn’t needed! It’s a goal to work towards! So work towards it! Even if it takes awhile! The ones who have other things to do, wouldn’t feel the timegate, as they have other things to do!!
---
I really don't get this excuse. Leaving queensdale isn't "Needed", so why not timegate leaving starting areas for 30 days?
---
Leaving the character creation screen isn't "needed". What's the logic? Because something isn't "needed" that means its aqcuisition has to be absurd?
---

Nope . . .

For the millionth time, there are no culinary applications for bloodstone dust. None. No good can come from feeding it to living beings.

He was too pure for this world. Beheaded by the Lionsguard in the stead of his captain.
---
Where is the source?
---
Yeah, I didn't even notice this was on r/GuildWars2 at first but I immediately thought of mordremoth when I saw it.
---
They also said that Seasons can still add things that normally belong to a expansion without giving us any further explanations on what to expect.

---
staff daredevil mechanics in are greatly different in gamemodes? do you lose extra dodge, and evades on staff skills or something?
---
judge the class from the skillset and see if it offers what you need.
---
in the end how hard is it to look for outnumbered fights videos and see which classes are mostly used in them and how they play?
---
yeah thanks, i found it later on that day
---
under-rated
---
I did the same thing with the choya pinata tonic, also w/ a friend! It was really an experience lmao
---
I'd bet power chrono as u can self apply most agressive boons while having lots of evades,blocks + the occasional distortion. But its probably more risky as you use you healing for dps so unless you block most of the stuff or evade you're gonna die.
---
 I don't regard it as a good cutscenes. Doesn't mean that I don't enjoy, or love it. It's so bad I'd say it's ascended into a type of comedyheaven.
---
&gt; so either people are leaving and the whales are just dumping more and more money in, or people are happier with the game than they may realize.
---
Or maybe it's the same old bunch vocally "leaving" a "dead game" on every media outlet every time one day after each patch, while the rest pretty much keep playing as they were with minor natural population rotation.
---
I told them I loved their name. They said 'Thanks, my parents chose well.' A+
---
You can do collections on alts. I have a main that did the story and discovered all of the new map. Now I am doing the collection on a better suited alt. Just finished egg collection and am waiting on reset.
---
Thanks for the Spoilers.
---
Kralkatiny.  Cutesatorrik.
---
Ofcourse that's a lot "based on the video", it's the only thing we have. 
---
Since the "context" button doesn't show me the previous comments for some reason, I can't see what maths you exactly meant, but I try to clarify some general things. 
---
Size: ~70000x80000x5000 inch (source, ingame measure) -&gt; 1800x2000x130 meters. I put 50 meters on top of the 130 in the assumption that the ocean is 50m deep.
---
Weight: I took the volume and the density of sand (30%) and granite (70%) to get the weight. I used sand and granite, because we don't know of what exactly the map consists and we don't know the density of Kralk. This one is probably the most speculative one. 
---
Height: I measured Kralks tail ingame (838 meters) and used it as a scale for the video, since his tail is good to see there. Since we can't see the exact heigt, I measured the route from the portal to where he was, when the scene switched to a close up of kralk. I used the height and the time to get his speed and used this to get the rest of the full height, since we know the time from start of the close up until he hit the water. Adding both heights and we get the full height of ~4600 meters. 
---
And also we got his speed of 828km/h.
---
Yes! I'm still waiting for Kraitkin to get it's proposed night-time glow effect that used to be a bug.  iirc, a dev did say it was a cool idea.
---
I would say condi necro would be the easiest.
---
How is what i said a pile of shit? The drawing does lack depth, there is literally zero depth to that. Nothing is 3D, there's no sense of perspective, the minimal shading doesn't add anything to the piece. It's an extremely valid, and accurate, description of the drawing. 
---
You're just being a whiteknighting carebear for no reason. A negative opinion is as valid as anything positive. If someone saying "wow awesome" doesn't have to add in constructive feedback as to why it's awesome, i don't have to for negative feedback. Besides, if this person is even a remotely decent drawer, then they will understand what i mean by a lack of depth, and be able to work out what to do from that.
---
Don't worry all others are shit too.
---
Any way to tell with GW2Efficiency or something like it to see how many of these have dropped?
---
Would anyone consider rewards 'content'?  Just curious what positions people would have in regards to this.
---
or rather two mounts for two different purposes. Do the same with griffon if skyscale is so much worse
---
I think it would be quite some work to mix two different legendary weapons (form, effects, etc.) together. Think of how different the two rifles are or the two shields. Sunrise and Twilight are same in form and effects with different colors.
---
Can't exactly skimmer up from mid-flight like you can with griffon, or if you're in combat.
---
Looking at these made me realise that, while the team did an absolute stellar job with the art, current elona misses a lot of the more sub-Saharan Africa influences, which is a shame because those are supper cool and unique.
---
I heard these days that so many have them that it isn't true anymore.  You disagree?
---
Ayy, I did mad king with you during Halloween! You were hilarious.
---
Nice save and use of the various skills there! Done the same thing myself a few times when I miss a jump and about to plummet to my death or into branded zones or something lol
---
Mordremoth is dumb and you should say it
---
Okay.
---
in most areas, there's enough space on the side of the sulfur to land. oh well, whatever floats your boat
---
I just grab 3 at the start if I happen to be around at the start. Managed to get 4 for the last round to finish it. Seems passive enough to me ...
---
i do not realize the similaritys, because in gw1 you always had that one point of reference, that starting point when you got into a map.  
---
doesn't matter in which map one did go, it always had the same entry point. also many missions where rather tube level then open areas, so it was always the same way in with the same view.  
---
there were just a few spots where i realized, oh this is from gw1. but maybe its also because i didn't play for a long time now so its not as familiar as it used to be. or its just the way more detailed level design. probably everything kinda factors into that.
---
I used to do Verdant Brink meta to gear my new lvl 80 characters but now most of the time there's not enough people to do the metas and the process is really slow now, so what's another good way of gearing up new characters?
---
Haha so funny, better put it as a spoiler so people have to click on it and give me an internet thumbs up!
---
Oh...okay...2 things:
---
1: You do not have masteries.
---
2: Mounts are not supposed to be directly better than one another. They have their own use...different mounts for different situations.
---
It's almost like different mounts have different purposes and strengths and weaknesses. Who'd have thought?
---
Uhhh Mordremoth is dumb!
---
Ah okay. I thought arc was already updated after the last gw patch.
---
Oustanding work, especially getting the locations lined up so perfectly. This is a project I had wanted to do since way back, but you're doing far better work than I could have ever dreamed! Thank you so much for the effort you've put into this!
---
This is really cool. Thanks for making this and sharing. :D
---
Imagine completely lacking talent and shitting all over someone else's work. 🤔
---
**^(Sigh...)** This is hardly evidence, of what I don't know... We can at least understand Skyscale is not the same as Springer and Griffon, it has very different functionality. Also the controls are fairly difficult to figure out, not many know about Mount Ability 2 and Skyscale sucks with default key binds imo.
---
I think Skyscale is a great exploration tool, it lets the player think about what to do. Controlling the speed you Ascend when you tilt your camera up and such. It could take time to master what to use Barrel Rolls for more than just going forward faster.
---
[deleted]
---
Just feeding kids some powdered Bloodstone.
---
 Give them that extra little boost.
---
My Dhuum cosplay got hit with the name-change, they definitely count stuff from GW2.
---
&gt; 1) leaving queensdale IS required because story demands you do it. The Skyscale personal mount is not demanded for anything, as there are borrowable ones where it is. So it’s not a requirement.
---
So? The collection requires you to do the skyscale.
---
Why is the story considered a requirement but the collection isn't?
---
&gt;2) it’s not really that padded. Remember griffin is 250! THAT is padded... but also, the 100g isn’t required for the Skyscale, it’s just to cut the “timer” down. There’s always friends who could/would give it for free or buy for ya (if ya got them). I’ve got casual friends who had stacked charged quartz over me. Plus, charged quartz is a drop chance from nodes! (Rare but still!)
---
Griffon isn't padded though. You do 5 quick scavenger hunts (Which in totality are smaller than the FIRST part of the skyscale colleection alone), two instanced missions and you're done.
---
The skyscale on the FIRST collection has a scavenger hunt that's bigger than the ENTIRETY of the griffon questline, followed by another scavenger hunt, followed by ANOTHER scavenger hunt, followed by 2 days of god knows what, all of it timegated to be stretched accross 8 days.
---
Gold doesn't mean padding. Gold just means a moneysink. Griffon doesn't hide its goldsink behind a timegate, the skyscale does. I'd much rather if the skyscale was upfront with its gold cost instead of hiding behind 22 days of wait and pretending the gold gate doesn't exist.
---
&gt;2) it’s possible I’m getting over inflated values from self bias, but it’s also possible that you’re UNDERestimating the gold gain the game has! Hell, just doing my events to unlock vendors, I netted 7g+ in green UNID. Like, didn’t even notice! Just was playing the game! The game throws it at ya! If I just went and enjoyed the map more, each day.. just playing... I’d make the gold required to skip a BUNCH of the “gate” of the charged quartz (again not really a gate as it can be skipped with gold from other players making, or farming and getting rare drops).
---
Just take into considering that the players who have nothing better to do will already have the gold, and players who still got other things to do are probably too busy to farm it, that's not counting people who just don't have the time for such a slog of a goldwall.
---
&gt;3) I consider t4 no cm super casual... because it’s just in and out no issues really. No care about party makeup or nothing... but that’s me. Others may not see it as casual.. in that regard there’s also dungeons! Daily dungeon paths give gold and a lot of loot to salvage for mats to gold. Plus if ya do, 8?, you get another 5g! Small but stacks up over time. (Not to mention daily achievements for 2g!)
---
Aside from the issue of difficulty which is still considerably high, there's also the issue of unlocking t4 in the first place without a party and the issue of agony resistance. To survive in t4 the gold it costs in ascendeds and infusions is far more than 100g in the first place. It takes a long time to get htere.
---
&gt;As for the 8 over 6 days, meh.. it’s still not that big of a time gate, as I work, and I can complete each bit for the day quickly, then move on to something more fun! I’m on day 3(4? Just did my egg subcollection yesterday) already and barely tried! (Some people would be on day 5/6?) Like, this really is a nonissue. 
---
That's a very selfish way of thinking. So, because it works out for you, that means everyone else can get fucked?
---
&gt;GW2 players are just too demanding of “give me now!!” Instead of just, playing and enjoying the game!!!
---
Have you considered that the issue people have is that they want to play and enjoy the game, but the game tells them "No, you can't progress right now, come back in 24 hours"
---
Like, this is an oxymoron. You chastise people for not playing the game... when the timegate prevents you from progressing is their exact issue?
---
I'd love to play the game, but the game is telling me to fuck off and return in 24 hours.
---
You're talking like we don't know what the masteries are. The first 2 are useless in this regard. The second one recovers a bit of flying meter once. I don't see how they would change the facts presented.
---
Imagine making a baseless assumption to try and seem funny.
---
Sure, so what's the strenght of this one? Being worse than every other mount while requiring a huge collection?
---
And regarding point 2, what's the use of this mount? Horizontally is almost worse than gliding, vertically is worse then springer. I'd be ok with an AFK Hovermount, but not with this collection.
---
I dunno. Hovering? Being an alternative to the griffon for people who don't have that one? Why do you even give a fuck; you clearly don't want it.
---
 Sure, so what's the strenght of this one? Being worse than every other mount while requiring a huge collection?
---
You always see her in dark areas. This is the first time you see her in bright light which brings out the contrast.
---
Guild Chat and also being able to read the text of the masteries.   
---
The first 2 masteries do basically nothing. The third one recovers a bit of stamina once. Completely irrelevant in this discussion
---
Lady Charr friend! ♥ You look fantastic, belated welcome to Tyria! I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, wheels keep turning, you keep fighting.
---
Everybody has other opinions, I really likes it. I thing it was epic.
---
My character's name is Optimus Caliph I also have Lazarus the dire,
---
So you're saying that because you found one spot on a map where the Skyscale is not the ideal mount, it's somehow worse than other mounts? Does that make the Rollerbeetle worse than the Springer, too? It couldn't climb that wall even a little. I feel like you're just going out of your way to shit on the Skyscale because you think it's cool to do so right now.
---
You can stop a video you know?
---
they finally buffed it, **N I C E**
---
You're on Reddit. This is not the Louvre. You're not going to see masterpieces by long-dead painters here. You're going to see artwork by people of varying skill levels. If you're not adult enough to handle that fact, then maybe you shouldn't be here.
---
&gt; Horizontally is almost worse than gliding..
---
How do you figure this is the case?
---
Ever heard of adventure quest? you could apply for a job there!
---
You clearly don't know because you made this thread.
---
People really need to realize that the achievements panel is basically your quest log, theres so many well thought out achievements that get you to interact with parts of the release you never would have before.
---
This makes no sense. Most people who are interested in an MMO buy the MMO when it's new and what you get after are people who discover it. If they weren't interested in the core game, and they weren't interested in HoT why in the world would they suddenly be interested in Path of Fire.
---
Every single MMO on the planet suffers from natural attrition. People have real life things and stop playing. They find other games and sto playing. They have health issues, or they stop gaming altogether because work is too busy. The play games that aren't MMOs that require less investment. They move to consoles and no longer play computer games. 
---
The most a game will usually sell is at launch, and the few months following. Same with books. A book will sell most if it's copies ever in the first 90 days of its existence. 
---
That doesn't mean the game is dying because less people are playing since it's expected less people will be playing. The business plan of a game will call for a critical mass. A certain amount that needs to be earned, a certain number of players for the game to be sustainable. 
---
Nothing I've seen so far suggests this game isn't sustainable. Anet wasn't sustainable because they had projects they couldn't get out the door that weren't this game. But that's nothing to do with the sustainability of this game.
---
What's not a good thing is people who don't understand the industry making comments like this. Tell me do current WoW expansions outsell older WoW expansions? 
---
Even if it happens very occassionally for certain MMOs, it's far far from the rule and not the way to judge the health of an MMO.
---
Your expectations are based on some internal logic and now how things have worked in the industry since it's inception.
---
It got bigger, but is still in its shell.
---
Yes it is? The fact it could do everything on one class is what made it OP. Now we need two classes for the same job. Nothing will ever reach chaos chrono again. Fb is strong, but it cant do everything chaos chrono could. Therefore it is not chaos chrono 2.0
---
Maybe it has to do with upcoming skyscale collections
---
Uh, next reset you feed them for the final 3 times and still need to wait till daily reset (next one) for new collections to appear...

In what world are you living in where 2-3 months is the normal release rate for content? Although I agree with you. Some people log in, do the story for 2 hours and then complain, there's more to it, however I don't exactly count achievements as part of it, although the collections do.

They smell like Traheaene

---
What gets me is that the way they've set this up, they'll never be able to add environments where it works really well, because most players aren't going to sit down and do it. New players coming into the game are going to look at the 20+ dollar price tag to play the six episodes, and the appropriate season 2 episode to play on dry top, only to spend 22 days to unlock the thing. 
---
The worst part about these timegates is that they're the most boringest sort of time gate; crafting. They could have literally limited food to a three times a day drop from the meta event and it would have been perfectly acceptable for a 3 day timegate.
---
Even WoW is letting players hide chestpieces to show off tattoos. 
---
At this point gratuitous nudity is the MMO meta.
