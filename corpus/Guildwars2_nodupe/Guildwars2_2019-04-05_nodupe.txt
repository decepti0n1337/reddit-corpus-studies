Awesome thanks for doing this, I just added you on discord, I'm gonna try to be apart of the entire train from the beginning lol

---
&gt;The whole premise of what causes Elder Dragons to awaken really threw me off, as what I thought was established at launch has slowly been turned on its head.
---

---
I thought that was the point of the whole twist that killing Zhaitan made everything worse. The dragons weren't "supposed" to die, they were supposed to continue their cycle of eating magic and then going back into hibernation. But then we came along and we basically fucked the natural-order so far up by not only fighting back, but actuallying winning.
---
I want Sharur but hammer is useless :(
---
What happened?
---
Well yeah, but there's no actual nudity or anything.
---
Did you know ranger has dagger offhand?
---
&gt;It's not 4 months in-story though. The game's story doesn't take place in our real-time.
---
But if we go by that, then in the short timeframe PoF and Season 4 takes place in, we killed a god, started and ended a war with a lich we also got killed and managed to personally fight another elder dragon.
---
The story isn't real-time, but i think the wait between episodes is actually measured in weeks, if not months.
---
[Part 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Year_of_the_Ascension_Part_IV) needs 10 wins in ranked on each minimum.

---
Ah yes. My favorite. 3 matches won = 1 match lost
---
exactly. same with hacks. they dont do anything about it cause they intend people like me to use them.
---
Some are straight random.
---
Wow.. I see enough people at chak gerant with 500 dps but it would never cross my mind to tell them that.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE STOP HAVING FUN
---
unfortunately what others say is correct, it's a reddit problem..not one particular to this sub
---
it's true that some subs are better curated and the community is more "mature"..
---
but unfortunately, people do treat the voting system as a like/dislike button spam for fluff and to promote or bury opinions instead of using it the way it was designed: as an indicator to how relevant something is to the discussion at hand
---
Sorcerer pants, human cultural t3 light

I play on high ping too (350ms) and have no issue with the ravine. The key is to know the safe spots and location of angry rocks. 
---
Basically run fast, stepping on the edges of the platform (not in the middle). This way you’ll pass the rocks without triggering them or they trigger after you’re gone. Stop at a large square platform (before angry rock to the left, with spike platform in front). 
---
Jump on the edge (leftside platform with angry rock) again and be at the second level on the spike platform ASAP. Immediately dodge into the corner of the wall to evade the first angry rock. After that, quickly run past second angry rock at the wall, jump down, run past monkey and hit the checkpoint. 
---
Right now I'm just spamming SAB. 
---
But basically I just do my daily achievements and then go from there.
---
The list of stuff that can be done daily is hundreds of items long. But basically the only thing I treat as a requirement is the 10 Achievement Points and 2 Gold from the standard Dailies.
---
Nah they will add spikes so you can't access anymore I bet
---
There is no class stacking. Wheres about are you getting confused? :)
---
No, just cus youre are good with jumping with your asura doesnt mean youre equal good with Charr or Norn
---
Maybe I will sound harsh so I will apologize in advance, but this game is prbly not for you.
---
The gameplay loop will not change. This is one of the main strenghs for many - like me and people that are playing this game for a very long time. It can get a bit more challenging if something new comes around but the moment you get used to mechanics you will be back to now. Failing in general is a very niche concept in gw2 especially with open world content and story - what seems the most you are gravitating towards. Regarding your mastery "problem": That is nothing you really have to worry about. Masterys are maxed out in a couple dozen hours of gameplay and after that you will play a couple hundreds - if not thousands - of hours never looking back. They don't have to be rushed, are nice to have but not absolutly nessesary and in case of pof they are most likely done before you leave their appropriate zones for aquisition.
---
I would say that some parts of the game are even more enjoyable as long as you do not own some of these masteries. But this state will not last very long even if you are actively trying to avoid them. But that is a topic for another day.
---
Rewards will not change. You will receive tons of loot in later (lvl 80) zones, but it will most likely be a whole lot of junk you are salvaging and selling the materials. Map completion - in regards of "big loot" - is only worthwhile for occasionally black lion keys or transmutation charges but you do not sound like a fashion wars player. There are some "oh shit" items but most of them are a) so rar that you will most likely never see one and b) nearly always obtainable via tradingpost from other players. That diminishes the sense of prestige for many ingame rewards. The chase for skins is one of the main driving points once you are reaching a certain level (not character level) ingame. If you are not into this, than you will most likely never feel satisfaction from a loot perspective in gw2. Some players are chasing gold for gem conversion but even those players are ultimatively seeking for skins only obtainable through the gemstore and not via other players. In its core the pve part of this game - in some regards competitive modes also - is a collection game.
---
If fractals and raids are the "meat" of the game for you, than you will find enjoyment for a short while. Sure. But development is not focused around both of these aspects. They are simply one part out of many and therefore you will endure very long waiting periods till new content hits (atm this means at least six plus months for a new raid and about the same time between the release of two fractals. Arenanet is not promising anything but there road map sounds like they are trying to improve their release schedule. But in the end the highly cooperative side of gw2 is not the main point of player engagement and most likely never will be. I highly doubt we will see faster release cadences in the near to midnear future. If ever.). If you are already bored at level 72 than fractals and raids will also not lasten very long for you. You seems to be a player that cares only for the first sucessful runthrough and they are over quite quickly. Challenging content is more accurate for fractals than for raids. The moment you get behind mechanics in gw2 you will start to see how undertuned even the most challenging fights especially in raids are at the moment. I will not say that raids cannot be difficult for many players, but most of the times their difficulties comes from a lack of knowledge and understandment than through actual challenging game mechanics. Gw2 is tuned to be accessible for everyone what is a strong point for many, but quite a downer for the most competetive type of pve player.
---
Gw2 today is more about the story and even if core tyria is a weaker part of story telling it is nowhere near "piss poor". But if it is not your taste - the personal story is only one part of the story telling in gw2, zones, zone events, npc dialouges and as unliked as they are achievements as well as collections are the other even bigger parts of the picture - it will most likely never be.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
These are the honest reasons why I think you should maybe consider to look somewhere else for a game the garners your attention more to your likings. Even gw2 is not for everyone ... otherwise there would be way more players actively playing.
---
Small tip: &gt;!You can find Killeens grave ingame, worth checking out !&lt;
---
But don't forget that you are running by default ingame. If you switch to walk, the way will take much longer. Also keep in mind that Dougal etc. had to sneak this way. 
---
This only additional to the point that the ingame world is scaled down to be playable.
---
If you want I can introduce you to my guild and give some ele advice since I main it too. DM me if you’re interested
---
Do not try to tackle everything at once. You will make mistakes, you will prbly miss out on some things, but you will find enjoyment in your attempts. If you want to know everything that is new to you right now you will get overwhelmed and burned out quite quickly. So trolly it sounds but to launch the game is the most appropriate advice someone can give you.
---
The Trading Post takes a 15% fee with every sale. If you buy at 21s and sell at 23s, youll lose 1s 45c per ecto (23s * 0.15 = 3s 45c).
---
Pretty much the same. But there’s always a need for support, and there’s different levels of play so plenty of chances to learn!
---
Wait what... /wiki and linking item works.. ive always typed it lol
---
Interesting, I didn't know that. Thank you for the explanation!
---
A trick that works for me even with dirty oceanic ping, is to jump straight up, then as you land press W and use a dodge at the same time. The effect makes you dodge roll forward up into the air, seems to give enough forward momentum reliably to make the stupid jump.
---
Yup, just started happening a few hours ago. Must be something on their end.
---
Thanks, appreciate knowing it's not just me :D
---
You can. You just need to open all of them first. When all 10(?) are done they all reset.
---
The infinite achievement for it only stops giving AP when you go through the whole set 10 times.
---
Would be nice to address skill lag. I know you [all] know it is an issue, but there have been many unresponded to threads on the ANet forums about this topic.
---
Yea, I found Gullik there and didn't realize it was her grave the time.  Whoops.  :p
---
Haha yeah you don’t really notice immediately, nice touch though.
---
Good grief, you're worse than children!
---
One thing I've done is instead of going full on diviner armour, I use normal berserkers with radiance runes. Diviner trinkets and zerker / diviner weapons depending on how important bd is.
---
I'm more into convenience than minmaxing though.
---
When I found out about this event. I had to find my self again. this is honestly just amazing to see the community come together for events like that. I hope to see yall there and having fun !

W1Z2 Tribulation Mode? Pshhh
---
W1Z2 Bouncing mushrooms on Tribulation Mode? monkaS
---
Feels like if you don't stop moving it typically works.
---
By that I mean, you only should bounce on each mushroom once.
---
Also avoiding the edges of the mushrooms tends to help.
---
This many people, I'd guess it's something on their end.  I checked my account and it has no new log in locations so I don't think it's a security-compromise related issue.
---
Not a bad idea. I never got an email either but that still came up.
---
Pretty interesting abstract, prompted me to read a couple articles on the gender spectrum. I do wonder exactly how many percent of people identify as neither male nor female? Articles I’ve read cite somewhat out of date surveys, from 1.2% to 2.7%. 
---
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/u-s-increase-trans-gender-nonconforming-people-13054716.php
---
Also, I’m not sure there is a ton of research out there trying to prove that gender is only binary. Being the default for many years, I imagine researchers in the field are not too keen on proving a default as opposed to a fresher alternative. 
---
This, and adventures aren't working properly. I'm not getting my daily time record updated and not receiving my reward chest for beetle time trial.

I don't mind losing more points than I would get for winning for balance reasons, but it shouldn't even put you in a match if losing puts your progress back 10 wins.

---
Excellent job!

same here, never got the e-mail
---
i can play clicking in send or cancel
---
I got a chuckle from this. Forget the haters. 
---
Something I find pretty crazy is how Zones 1-3 are all the same instance. Maybe having so many HUGE instances like these is why ArenaNet says NO on making World 3. Hmm..
---
How do condition builds compare against power builds?  Is one definitevly better than the other?  What are the trade offs and why do they matter?  
---
Condi cleanse comes from fumigate, cleanse gyra, shield 4 and 5 protection, med kit 3 right?
---
When I bug out on a mount, then I can only fix it by mount the exact mount directly (so not using the general mount button, but the shortcut for that mount)
---
Save it until you know more about the combat mechanics and the classes purposes a little better at least. You dont need to level from 1-80 to learn the abilities. One session in target practice while following a guide is good enough. I went from 1-80 and further without knowing what confusion and stability was.
---
You can build it a few different ways.  Anything that grants protection also cleanses/converts.
---
So toolbelt skills like [Toss Elixir H](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toss_Elixir_H) and [Reconstruction Field](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reconstruction_Field); traits like the [Over Shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Over_Shield) you mentioned, [Reconstruction Enclosure](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reconstruction_Enclosure), and [Experimental Turrets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experimental_Turrets) + Thumper Turret; or even Rune sets like [Durability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Durability) and [Herald](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Herald).  
---
If your team really gets condi-bombed use [Med Pack Drop](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Med_Pack_Drop) to convert ALL conditions on your party instantly.
---
These are all 5-target skills, meaning you can cleanse like clockwork.  There's a reason Scrapper is considered a hard counter to Scourge.
---
Are you being antist?
---
sPvP can be done with any character at any level since it sets your level to 80, normalizes your gear and stats, ignores you equipment (besides the fact that you have armor of any type and what type of weapons), and unlocks all skills and traits. So feel free to try out sPvP on a level 2 character in white gear, it's the same as a maxed out character. 
---
As for PvE all of the professions you listed have viable builds, you can see some examples for [fractals here](https://discretize.eu/builds), [raids here](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/), and [other builds here](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki). As long as you're looking at builds and know what you're doing you'll be fine.
---
PvP and WvW dailies are some of the fastest and most rewarding things you can fit into your daily routine. Specifically, focus on the easy to obtain ones:
---
PvP: Top Stats, Player Killer, Rank Points, and Reward Earner
---
At least one, and often two, of those four dailies are available every day, and you don't even need to played rated matches to complete them: going into the Game Browser tab of the PvP window, you can find a number of "Daily" rooms, where people work together to get quick and easy daily achievements completed. Just make sure you read and follow the rules of whatever room your in.
---
WvW: Big Spender, Caravan Disruptor, Land Claimer, Master of Monuments, Guard Killer, and Veteran Creature Slayer. Additionally, if you're comfortable with solo-capping camps, you Camp Capturer is a daily quite frequently.
---
All of those are solo-able and require no help from allied players nor do they require you to even fight other players (though you will sometimes get ganked trying to cap things, as that's just the nature of the game mode).
---
Doing these dailies will progress your rank within each role, but will also earn you Reward Track Potions -- this is where the real value is at. Completing reward tracks can get you everything from unique weapons and armor to dungeon tokens/weapons/armor to Living World episode currencies to Mystic Clovers for making legendaries and much, much more. Plus their full of boxes and materials along the way.
---
Basically, for 10-30 minutes a day you can get tons of reward track progress with very little actual effort.
---
Their are two email issues - I don't think its a hack or scam.
---
• The email about checking your subscription emails to get the free cosmetics - which keeps spamming you.
---
• Every time you log in it wants to verify.
---
Edit: I am also now being asked to verify with 2fa on all accounts. But it's not saving even when checking the box.
---
Something is fucked with their systems.
---
One of the big issues for a lot of games tbh is lack of population of the upper echelons so they cant just have a game of 10 people in the 1800 rating range which would cause this not to be the case
---
It feels like changing your character's direction (facing) near the impact on the trampoline completely kills the ability to bounce off the thing.
---
His name is Johnny in English version?!
---
Aren't you supposed to be working at work? If I was someone's boss, I'd be pissed that they were browsing Reddit regardless of what they're looking at.
---
Tbh, this section can be easy. I spent maybe 30-40mins as well on the first attempt, less on the second and first try on the third. It's just memorizing the exact part to jump on and understanding how to get distance from a standing start. 
---
This is with 250-300 ping.
---
It's also whar you hear all characters in game speak.
---
I doubt they will change anything about this, because of two reasons:
---
- It will become unclear to players that the achievement can be repeated if it stays filled;
---
- Technically that's what happens to repeatable achievements once you complete them - they reset their progress. Changing that would require adding hacks to a perfectly fine code, and some programmers are very avert to the idea of adding hacks like that for convenience's sake.
---
Personally, I'd be happy even if they start [putting this small image on top of achievements](https://i.imgur.com/lWzWp9v.png) again. They used to do this a long time ago, but abandoned the practice somewhere down the line. It would at least help players distinguish repeatable achievements from not-started ones.
---
Do not answer on a ticket again, this will put you at the end of the queue . Depending on the Issue it can take a little bit longer especially  on account access issues.
---
So your proposal is...?
---
A well formulated response. Once you understand how it works it's not that difficult.
---
Nice crossover of the two games that have stolen a good chunk of my life.
---
Sorry, no, either you love marketing or you're incapable of joy. Sorry buddy :(
---
Okay, this is epic
---
Calm down here Lahey
---
hahahah either you love tacky marketing stunts or you're incapable of joy
---
ooookay, oh undamaged one
---
Where they ever not slow? Slow is the normal speed here.
---
&gt; banned my account as final answer
---
What was the question, i wonder.
---
keybind another mount directly (rabbit for example of you get hit in raptor - for shift-2 for example). press that keybind once - mount will change with bug, press twice - you get dismounted with bug removed.
---
poser means, do not open new tickets regarding same issues "this will put you at the end of the queue"
---
I wouldnt reccomend mesmer chrono support for pugs in fractal :) I just did that and man is it pain to be useful in fractal... Basically you have only wells now after changes to give your boons... And no one stands in one place in fractal pugs... It just feels like you are trying to put together herd of sheeps to put wells under them and do your rotation... And they have to stay three pulses to get the boons... And while  you are focusing on giving your boons you dont notice boss mechanics and get killed... So instead of supporting your team you just give them more work to do because they have to ress you... Man am I dissapointed in chrono supp in fractals.. Would go back to power if it wasnt so expensive... For better chronos than me: feel free to disagree but try running pug instead of your set group of friends and you will know the pain as well...
---
Pff .. Armor - Achievements and then crafting. Weapons - Specialization Weapon Collections. Rings , Accessories , Back Item and Amulet from tokens. Tokens are map materials wich are specific just for that map. Example would be Jade Shards wich you can farm and then buy ascended amulet and back item. The best would be Bitterfrost. There you can get Ring, Earling, Back Item and UnderWater Mask. Again the whole list you can find on wiki. 
---
Yes, it does matter pumpkin. Anyway, we are talking about a landmark, non interactive piece of texture. There is no gameplay involved, therefore talking about engine limitation is laughable excuse on your part. They clearly didn't care to have unified vision of this place in their universe so (as always) they put very little effort to actually show us the place where Adelbern doomed his own nation.
---
I vote for renaming this PoI to:
---
1. Foefir's Fart
---
2. Adelbern's Middle-life crisis.
---
we are talking about a landmark, non interactive piece of texture. There is no gameplay involved, therefore talking about engine limitation is laughable excuse on your part. All it required is someone to care enough to make it look awesome enough to know this is where Adelbern doomed his nation.
---
Best way for a beginner to get it is from fractals (dungeons 2.0) as a random rewards. but you should also look at various achievments that will reward you with asc items. crafting is also an options. the first set is the hardest one to get, but if you start doing fractals regualry with increased difficulty (more chance to get rewarded) or even dabble with raids you will swim in them in a short time.
---
Do not really wary about trans charges, they come along as you complete other goals. And as long as you are not competing for dps you can just wear the item you like with no care about your build being bit off.
---
Once you achieve the moment of having ascended gear in all slots, you will have more than enough trans charges.
---

Pretty sure they will just work so you can transform them into any sigil/rune in the game

they just ask me to secure all my related account. 
---
i did all that 
---
even reset my stupid cell phone back to default.
---
and then i got blocked and no reply since then. i should not to submit another ticket for asking why they block me . moron me...
---
Thank you for the detail reply!
---
I talked to other people who has similar issues or "victim buddies". their account not get blocked. that is why i am asking in reddit. 
---
and it is so hurtful i missed all the SAB daily tokens!
---
crafting is straight forward way, other options like achievements and random drops apply
---
But here is the thing, you have not "claimed every reward you can get from it" because you will still get the chest for completing the achievement every time you complete it. you will just not get AP for it anymore.
---
Though, I do agree that some form of change should happen for those infinite achievements because they are not really that distinguishable from each other. For example, in SAB you have the Drooburt Achievement which you need to complete 5 times to get all the achievements but the AP only vanish from the overview and you have to go into the achievement itself and see that you got all the AP available. An indicator would be great to know that you got all the available AP already for an Infinite Achievement.
---
ALT F4
---
OOH! I didn't know about this video, cheers for the link! &lt;3
---
But that is exactly what u/e-scrape-artist said with something hacking around to make it work somehow.
---
Making the infinite achievements visually different could be one step and then adding an Icon to them for make it visually representative that you got all the achievement points from it could be enough for me.

Hi,
---
I just bought both expansions on a certified retailer (-35%),
---
I have some questions, **but I'd gladly take any tips in general for someone who will be 100% focus on pve in the game.**
---
Does  the daily login reward has a deadline ? Like if I don't log in every  day in the month, it reset to the start (like in The Elder Scrolls  Online) ?
---
Will I get Hero points in the main story of Path of Fire ? The staff specializations looks cool :D
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Fancy salad you got there! I like the left one more, complementary colors look more organic and richer than something monochrome-ish
---
I really wished we could color the aura. Would make for way less forced green rangers in general. Or orange/fire warriors. Or blue/white/black guardians. 
---
Yeah what is that music? it's great (the skip is great too btw).
---
That is Firebrand, that’s why the title for getting kills in rated PvP as guardian is called Champion Paragon or something like that.
---
He probably found that link on a post here 
---
Between the two I would go for left as the Soulbeast aura is really strong and the right one would not fit with it.
---
However, if you feel like its too green you can definitely add some red and brown and gold to spice it up. I have a slyvari ranger too that I can show if you are interested.
---
Would love to see yours!
---
It's rather poor on their part to not consider accepting refined silk for the festival as well. It's punishing to expect players to store all that silk for an entire year before the festival comes round again, and without other meaningful sinks for silk.
---
A little late to the party, mate.
---
if you play as support duo at least for fractals, you could use the quickbrand/alacrene combo and just use full berserker gear and use your infusions on this gear
---
Crafting is a decent way to get armor and weapons - easy, but expensive. Trinkets, rings, necklaces, etc are very easy to get from a lot of the Living World zones. You can also get them from fractals and such, or WvW. All sorts of ascended gear can be gotten from raids, too, and you can get by with exotic gear in raids just fine. You do, however, need ascended gear beforehand for higher level fractals, since you can only put agony resistance "enchantments" into ascended equipment.
---
If you want to craft your first ones, [gw2crafts](http://gw2crafts.net/) gives you the easiest and cheapest ways to level up your crafting, while [gw2effeciency](https://gw2efficiency.com/) tells you exactly what you need to craft things, plus how much it will cost you - and you can go to the GW2 homepage, to your account, and make an API key so the site can see what materials you already have.
---
One super important thing to remember with crafting ascended gear is that you can use the mystic forge to change the gears stats, though it will cost you some gold. Not nearly as much as making an entirely new set, though. So if you accidentally make the wrong stats or want to change later, just remember that [you can always change it.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing)
---
Mine was a WvW vista back in the day. One where I had to wait weeks for the team colors to change so I can get it.
---
There is a chest at the end of each map. On tribulation mode it has a chance to drop kaiser snake skin boxes
---
The plot of Guild Wars 2 is about world ending dragons. Any other villain will always be a sideshow and feel like it. You can't change that without rendering the story not a story. 
---
IPs can give false geographical locations. I'm from one part of the US, but ANet's servers think I'm from another.
---
MMOs are often filled with busywork because players often used them in lieu of having/getting a job.
---
They're pretty popular timesinks.
---
You're mostly right, but it also depends on the class. Glass cannon reaper and glass cannon weaver are 2 quite opposite definitions of "glass" and room for error.
---
I can see why, Logan starts out as a young man struggling to find his place, (especially in comparison to the rest of his family). That's pretty relevant to young men.
---
Just a heads up since you seem to really be fixed on completing things. I used to hunt every corner of Tyria to unlock every achieve because it gave me a long term goal like the GWAMM title in GW1. But, i soon figured out that there are temporary, hidden and removed achievements that really remove the whole complete feeling. You will never have 100% and that's something i disliked to the point where i gave up on achievements and thus reduced my playtime by 90%. Furthermore achievements get nerfed into oblivion just like they were in GW1. Things that took hours upon hours to complete or required actual skill have been reduced to child's play and this is something that is repeated over and over in the GW franchise.   
---
So if you're looking for that great feeling of working towards being complete, that unfortunately is a huge dropped ball for players like me. And don't waste time grinding for one specific achievement. Give it a year or two and you can grab it by facerolling your keyboard within 5 minutes.
---
oh it is shit hot for all of us, unless you still use win7 or dont have minimum 8gb ram or love gw2hook or mount radial dial or anything else that uses the chain_loader

Ha not bad
---
Personally, I use GW2 Launchbuddy to log in to my 3 accounts. I can log in one at a time, or run all 3 at once if I like - the latter option is great for home-instance farming and the ultimate in antisocial PvP dailies.
---
Also drops on normal mode, just even rarer.
---
Yeah, the in-game map is about ten times smaller than it 'should' be if the distances were more realistic. I'd love huge maps like that, but it's not really feasible.
---
You can see this most strongly when you compare your character's size to mountains, which are scaled down in the game to about a tenth of the size; or to the trees on said mountains, which look oversized in comparison to the geology (but not, say, buildings).
---
For me Sieran is dead :(
---
yeah happened to me as well, but even though i click the send authentification to email option on several different loggings it never sent the mail to me
---
I did know that humans were introduced to Tyria. I always assumed that most of Tyria was just a land mass on a larger planet. I also figured The Mists was more like this alternate reality where the past and the dead are captured into an after life where it is remembered and replayed.  
---
I had not thought of the concept that there were more planets out there and that they had thought of Tyria as part of a Solar System. And which one is Tyria in this diagram/art piece? I presumed it was the one with one moon around it, but they also have a really large moon that goes around all the planets in this Solar System.  
---
That also means that there are planets much larger than Tyria out there.
---
ONLY WITH POWER OF ELONIAN MUSK!
---
Yeah when I accidentally stumbled into that place it hit me in the feels. /Kneel
---
harder problems take more time
---
This stopped doing it for me recently.. at least the past 8 accounts I've logged in so far.
---
Did the same jp for bolt precursor. Had to level my mesmer up from 20 to 30+ so I could use teleports for when I fucked up. 
---
I don't regret my legendaries so far. Nevermore, Envoy Light, Kraitkin, Bolt, and working on Binding of Ipos.
---
While I don't regret it, I still am not entirely sure *why* I made Kraitkin.
---
Oh dear.
---
i'd love to know all the 2-3 skips you mentioned
---
Is the Guild Wars 2 Wiki broken or is it just me? It's been days and I still can't access it :( 
---
Do you know if DX12 Proxy and GW2Hook work together?
---
No, he shits first and drinks coffe after... Then shits some more
---
As for Karma farming, go to Sandswept Isles and get the third Karma bonus (costs some gold and Volatile Magic at the vendor), this buff gives you 200 karma for each enemy you kill. Do the Specimen Chamber meta pre-event and tag as many mobs as you can. With something like Thief Shortbow or Necro Staff you can easily get 30k (yes, no typo) karma in around ~10 minutes.
---
Can also be done on all other season 4 maps, most of the metas throw tons of enemies at you. 
---
I like when ~12 wins are canceled out by 1 loss
---
Dosen't matter. It contains always lvl 80 gear
---
My friends just started playing the game. They boosted level 80s on EU servers. All my characters are NA. And I’m struggling which to transfer. I haven’t played in years but I have full ascended guardian and revenant. Half ascended necro and a boosted but not played Mesmer. Are any of these classes not viable right now? I seem to enjoy Mesmer the most but recall it has the most pressure for raiding back in the day. Any thoughts on who to play? I recall DH had no place in raids. Is that still the case?
---
Also, I’m struggling relearning the game. Is there any good welcome back guides? Thanks so much!
---
As a PvE player I not really regret forging The Juggernaut, but it just rests in my inventory becuase hammer is not used in PvE.
---
One of my wild theories I pester my guildies with is, at the end of the whole story (after all expansions and such), Tyria/the world will be left to ruin by the dragons, the gods will return and another migration for all sentient being to another planet/plane/place in the mists, so GW3 could possibly restart and have a whole new 'insert bad guy here' enemy for a whole new era/story to begin. 
---
why even make this comment
---
No on Gw2 Wiki. There is a label where you can put your API and with that it will show you everything you want. You can find that in collections. For example SaB skin collections. By putting this API into the label you would be showed wich skin you have and wich you dont. Hidding the API key isnt important right now. That will be problem for later. For now I wanted to put the API key into it so it would show me items wich my characters have on them and so on. [Take a look](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:DiegoDeLaHouska) The whole Equipment section would be better automated bz the API. Still want to add skins next to those items but thats also for future. 
---
12.5% is for Armor, Weapon, Backpiece and Accessories included. Just the armor is 5%.
---
&gt; I’m struggling which to transfer.
---
And let men end your struggle here, if you decide to move it is your whole account that moves, therefore all of you characters. But if you hesitate, esp. considering the relearning aspect: just make a new account there on EU, even a free one would do, you can finance it from your main NA.
---
Not viable? I doubt, anything can and could be played anywhere to a different levels of success, but not making anything nonviable. 
---
then you might want to look at [the home instance cats](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hungry_cat_scavenger_hunt) which has what you are describing.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I have hosted my own runs every day in the course of this week. I either get kicked out of my own group by some elitist 150+ KP players joining (while the LFG message explicitly said low KP group), or you get players that don't know the mechanics. In the last case, you even get a chance to make it into the instance, hurray \\o/). As i said before, i have no problem with people that don't know the mechanics, but more often than not, you get players that don't know the mechanics and (sometimes) don't even know how to play their class and don't contribute to the group. Fractal CMs is content where 2 bad players in the group can wipe the entire goup easily. You then spend hours trying to explain mechanics and tell people how they can improve their gameplay. This takes a lot of time. Again, no problem with that, everyone has to learn. I'm in no way saying that i'm flawless at it, but i know the theory behinds the mechanics, which most low KP players don't. I don't want to train new people every day. I have other stuff to do. In my opinion, it would be more efficient to form a static group, learn the mechanics together for a few runs while having patience while group members learn (which is also not to be expected in LFG groups) and then run the content together consistently to build up our KPs. Hence, this post.
---
Leave it empty. Just think "It's done but it's a visual bug that displays it empty". Or like one of the historical APs that lacks any colour backing.
---
you'll be fine grabbing a set of exotic from the TP (thats the abbreviation btw, stands for trading post)
---
if you are going to work towards ascended you'll want a set of exotic in the mean time anyway, if you are just looking for something like a set of berserker gear (the power stat gear) then instead of searching for Berserker on the TP seach instead for the named variation of the type you want, e.g. Zhed's for light, Nika's for medium and Devona's for heavy. It will be alot cheaper that way (usually several gold per item cheaper)
---
The boomerang does have greater range but the whip can pass through walls.
---
But this is interesting to know as I wondered how other characters might get the 'upgrades'.
---
`tracert 52.204.54.25` if it gets there (type in command prompt)
---
It is?!?! Oh you have just made my whole life! crisis averted! and good to hear everything can be played anywhere. Definitely want to relearn just intimidated, but you have helped my decision immensely, so thank you!
---
I'll try this tonight. I appreciate the tips. It's just weird lol. I can go to a zone and 9 out of 10 times its fine but that one time the ping will just stay high until i relog. 
---
The current meta thief build is rotationally based, making it moves around the map quickly in order to give it's team unfair advantage in certain fights.  With shortbow and core steal, you have many ways to move around the map effectively.
---
Your build sounds more like a skirmisher, one that rotates similar to a holo or core guard.  While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's an entirely different role than a rotational thief.  S/D won't usually push into fights on it's own or contest a side node.  It will most likely focus down priority targets in important fights while rotating.
---
Yes
---
I like left yea. Right is hot too
---
YB's mascot
---
how can people have full ascended already not on a year while me,deciding which character to play for a year now. 
---
The universe that contains Tyria is in the Mists.
---
The Mists is what's contains all that exists. You can't go to the mists by traveling any distance in any direction. You have to poke a hole in reality to leave reality and go into the mists. 
---
Here's a tip, if you managed to get all the HP in HoT maps, you only need to get all of Crystal Desert HP (there's 5) to fully unlock both Elite Profession.
---
Maybe it's not an easter egg. Maybe that April fools wasn't a joke
---
how could they not? you could play all of them for 1.33 months each by now.
---
We strolled around Ebonhawk looking for Kranxx lab, the warehouse or the escape route into the sewers.  At best we found an Asuran lab in a building with a locked door, an exploded area of town which apparently fell to mortar fire, and a hatch by a tree that led to an Order of Whispers safehouse.
---
you sacrifice a lot and your build looks like a weird hybrid that doesn't accomplish anything
---
s/d core is based around mobility, evasiveness, very low cd steal
---
by going rifle you forego all the mobility and by skipping acrobatics you lose important defensive traits
---
thief's job with s/d is to run around and +1 fights which you can't do effectively..rifle deadeye relies on ganking from stealth but that's been nerfed pretty hard and there is no reason to combo it with s/d when s/p is better in that build
---
so how much better is s/d core over your build? probably a lot
---
check out metabattle to see which build has more opportunities, but in general there would be at least one build for any class that could do some content. 
---
Ember was not what I expected.  With the name Ember I don't know why I expected something other than red-ish fur.  Maybe because Almora is her granddame?
---
Then you never seen a rabbit o\_O
---
Login dailies, faster material timegate crafting, starting over for the fun of it, inventory storage. Lots of reasons really. I have 22 myself which is a bit overboard but with daily login rewards, the $10 I would’ve spent of gems paid itself off and now they’re even turning a profit. Plus I can do dailies on them for an extra 2 g if I’m bored. 44g per day just for doing 3 quick dailies isn’t that bad of a deal. 
---
I actually really like the ad.  It's eye-catching, simple, and genuinely makes me interested to learn more.  I don't look at ads with too much going on, but if something is visually interesting enough to draw my eye, I might click out of curiosity.
---
If your on NA servers yes
---
regret? i made the spear purely to have an (admittedly awesome) underwater legendary- i regret absolutely nothing.
---
The current season, LS4
---
As soon as you hit 80, you go for full exotics armor and weapons from dungeons is the cheapest way, which makes you effective for upcoming farms and contents, takes about few days.
---
You enter fractals as soon as you can (full exotic w&amp;a) and get your ascended rings (remember to attune them). And join guild missions for cheap accessories (2-3 weeks)
---
If you have been leveling for a while you have some laurels from daily login rewards, so you get amulet from wvw vendor.
---
Back, used to be the slowest to get, but with winterberry farm or straight up spending of 90 gold in MF it is quite easy.
---
Somewhere between all this, you have your crafting going on, which takes couple of hours to hit 500 if you are in a hurry. And your fractals (daily recommended ones) let you purchase the items from the vendor. There are also lucky drops, and achievement weapons to consider. By the time you complete T2 of fractals. Lets say 4 weeks of your journey to full ascended, you will have enough items to enter Tier3... which will increase chances, and vendor currency too. Soon enough you are in T4 hunting your last couple of items.
---
Total something like 120 Hours over a month or two.
---
There is also a f2p version, where it took roughly 2 months to get full ascended, with minor help with TP transactions from a full account.
---
Only engi fits the "non mindless" part. They can all be pretty bursty.
---
sb, enji, thief (in this order)
---
if you sit by the river long enough, sword holo will float by
---
Thief is a pretty shitty class at this point in the game in terms of PvP. It's one dimensional, useless in nearly all cases (unless you have a fully coordinated team - you won't in solo queues), relies heavily on other 4 players in your team to basically carry you by working around your gameplay, and hasn't really changed how it plays in any form since 2012.
---
Your DE build is "meh" at best, and you should play a more useful class than playing a s/d thief.
---
Sharur is one of the coolest legendaries
---
It isn't as much them not showing up, but them being too low. So when you step on all those terrains that are not matching collision properly and let your feet sink to the ankles, the footfalls will be under the floor instead on the surface of the terrain. 
---
ty for this!
---
I already got exotic armor and weapons and ascended Trinkets. i just dont have the gold to craft ascended and i dont know how fractals work really.
---
but im planning to play fracs.
---
and i want to ask what is the gear requirment for
---
t1 t2 t3 t4 fractals. ty in advance! 
---
1. You have to pay for both. Sometimes there are sales. You should wait for one of those
---
2. Community is still full of great players
---
3. I dont play PvP. 
---
That's a theory i came up too, but i tried walking on the floor of the mistlock sanctuary, which is totally flat, and they show up randomly :/
---
Logging in, selecting a character and closing the game takes maybe 30 seconds. Over 28 days you accrue 20 mystic coins, 55 laurels (assuming you choose the chest of plentiful laurels on day 28), 1 random exotic piece of equipment, and a bunch of crafting mats. The mystic coins are worth at least 1g each, the laurels are 75s each. 30 seconds per day, at least 60 gold per month per account.
---
enjoy pure white glow at center of the screen on your way forward XD
---
Saved.
---
I started getting similar problems over the past few months. I'm running over WiFi, so I think my first step will be to try a Wi-Fi adapter, but it's good to see other ideas as well.
---
This one wasn’t From the chest though, must’ve been from dailies.
---
Which is why I said if I’m bored I’ll do it. I normally just have launchbuddy and an autohotkey script that logs me in and then closes the game. It runs when I’m asleep so there’s no time spent for me. 
---
1. See the other answers
---
2. Yeah everything still feels pretty populated, still see people running around old maps, and HoT is still super full of players
---
3. I just recently started getting into Pvp and I love it. Definitely super rewarding in terms of loot/money. Queue times around about a minute and a half average, but lately it's been pretty much all I've been doing. 5v5 conquest (capture the zones, gain points) is gonna be what you probably will want to play, as stronghold is kinda meh (summon minions, push lanes. moba-lite)
---
&gt; Harriers is a pain though. I ended up skipping the backpiece since it's a pain.
---
My healer druid has Rising Banners of the Sunspear. IIRC, that was fairly easy to get and didn't feel like a grind.
---
I think it's related to culling. I noticed that my Bifrost footfalls disappear most often in areas with a lot of players. Other legendaries don't but Bifrost does for whatever reason. 
---
Astralaria has a similar problem, but they show up after a delay rather than being culled completely. It's definitely weird and inconsistent.
---
Regarding this, i tried playing with the LOD settings but with no results 
---
Ah the old "don't complain about something that's clearly broken if you don't have a solution ready-made" argument. 
---
none of them are mindless, in this case.
---
don't we need to do step 2 to do step 1? :P
---
Alternatively you can 'buy' the skins of Twilight and Sunrise. Basically someone sends you both weapons, you bind them and forge Eternity and sent it back. I did it for like 1.2k I think.
---
Yes, I tried the same. I submitted a few bug reports on this years ago when I noticed it, but never had success with getting it fixed.
---
Yes, that is one of the choke points on that map where most give up. The other is the room with the ice+spikes+wind combo.
---
Thinking about it, I am a lot slower without shortbow and steal teleport. I spend most of my time in matches engaging / disengaging with sword 2 and shadow step to spike targets down quickly. 1v1s I’m not that strong, so maybe mobility is still more important to prioritise, so I can rotate more efficiently.
---
Do you play any particular build?
---
Fair enough!
---
Interesting:-)
---
Because people cant handle someone being better than them or fact that they can't win all the time.
---
I can only talk about my own opinion, sometimes its just not worth it to keep playing if the skillcap between the teams is to different. I dont really see a reason to try if there isnt any hope of getting a good game, its also not really fun to play a game that goes 50-500
---
Onesided games are sadly to common were one team is way better than the other.
---
Why? It's my life.
---
The whole game is because it's catering to such players. Not surprised at all, it's expected if nothing. 
---
This is hilarious though!
---
...because some people do not like putting in any energy in a game they believe is lost.
---
It has little to nothing to do with "punishment" as some people here want to believe, and everything to do with effort v/s reward.
---
Yeah, it's very sad how mismanaged this game is.
---
And you afk for any reason you listed? You are part of the problem, the other part is game that allows you to afk.
---
More and more kids are dropping out of school to follow their dream of being a popular content creator. They have no manners and most of them show no sportsmanship either. 
---
Sadly you don't learn those two in games, but IRL.
---
Hopefully I can participate! 
---
*"Defecatin' to the sunrise - downright glorious..."*
---
Haha, one of the most memorable scenes from that game for me.
---
The problem is that people like me, that are not really good, get matched against people, that are really good, it's frustrating and makes a really bad game experience for worse pvp players.
---
&gt;	Most people laid off were working on other projects, but some of those were absorbed back into GW2.
---
I don't think anyone who was laid off was subsequently reassigned to work on GW2.
---
I agree, but bugs have nothing to do with general content difficulty. 
---
I meant something like HoT maps, wintersday "raid", raids in general, bandit champions, shatterer/serpent ire etc.
---
WvW had been unplayable for me since Wednesday.
---
Ah yes, G v G.....
---
Imagine a tribulation cloud in the ice+spikes+ wind combo room
---
Yes I already tried to do the script on 3 lines but didn't work either.  
---
I was able to run it and to make it work once i just opened the script as administrator, works perfectly now.
---
Thanks for the help though ! :)  
---
Mirage isn't helping. It's a selfish spec with next to no value for your fun at the expense of others.
---
Being aggressively toxic and elitist is the only way to have certain players understand they arent helping, just dragging their group down. Since they tend to ignore being asked or told to reroll yet continue to stick to the group, you're not giving players that disagree with your point of view any other options.
---
Its evident that more and more pugmanders in both EU and NA kick players and specs refusing to take the group into account. and those that dont tend to struggle badly as soon as opposition shows up.
---
Say no to leeches and become elitist now!
---
Plenty of people are where you're at and that's okay! My guild ( the five of us, which only three have played in the last month) are still working on getting geared up for PvE content, one just hit 80 last month!
---
We play pretty sparsely except my aunt, but we would love to invite you to pay with us when you're interested!
---
Dianthess/Nakk.8920 in-game and we play Sat at 8 PST but that might be changing to Mon or Tues
---
This invite is extended to everyone, as well. Not just OP
---
Considering that you can barely reach endgame without expansions, it's pretty viable.
---
Yes, I also got one, but it didn't send an e-mail when I clicked send.  Was kind of worried it was some sort of phishing, but seems like it's just a weird thing on their side.
---
You should learn that gw2 is not your child so I can have my own opinion different than yours and it's not causing your fragile world to collapse.
---
My collections are a dagger and a torch lol. Idk if those are good on a warrior but i was letdown a bit.
---
What do you mean? My understanding is that endgame in GW2 is mostly consisted of Fractals and Raids, only the last one being restricted by expansions. So I'd have access to all fractals with only the base game right?
---
Bouncy rocks are the true enemies
---
You are actually 100% on point. Tyria and Elona are weak. 
---
Also, after 6 years the whole elder dragon lore is getting quite repetitive. 
---
So how about cantha acknowledges the fact that Tyria and Elona are weak af, and since both Elona and Tyria were former colonies of cantha, cantha declares war on Elona and Tyria and tries to take over the old colonies. 
---
Only shing yea monks stay neutral and serve as peaceful tranquile areas whereas core kaineng are war areas where we fight our way into the capital, taking down the leadership behind this offense. 
---
Maybe we'd even go to jade sea/echo forest first to gather allies against kaineng
---
I don't own GW1.
---
While it is indeed hard, it's also something you can do solo. So it is purely dependant on the player's skill.
---
The rewards are also entirely cosmetical (well, outside of the ascended weapons given by the weapon collection) and account bound, so they have no intrinsic value, but using them still shows your mastery in the given content.
---
Oh, well there's no point then, it's 100% dead.
---
Just because you think, what you do, makes you a good commander, doesn't mean you are.
---
You kick people for simply playing what they enjoy. Now, if your squad if already full, sure enough. Generally, if a comm tells me, they don't want me, I'd never try and force me into their squad (which wouldn't work anyways). But if your squad is full, it's likely, that the few mirages or thieves you get would not make a difference in the first place. I find squads all the time (and I sure hope others do, too! It's fun to roll over the map, take objectives, defend them or fight other zergs) and we usually have no issues, when the squad is large enough. If the squad is not large enough, then what happens? You have empty slots and you deprive your squad of those extra dps and targets. (even if the clones do not take that much damage, they DO take damage, they are additional targets, and with infinite horizon they can last quite some time)  
---
If you do have empty slots yet the map is full ... well, only because I left the squad it doesn't mean that magically I disappear from the map.  
---
But sure, you're the commander of your squad, you call what you need and want, and I would never disrespect that, even if your assumptions about me do feel disrespectful. You do not know me at all. You don't know what kind of person I am - apart from the fact that your assumption obviously have offended me. You roll your way, I roll mine, and as long as we both have fun, it's all good, right? I don't make it into your squad, we each think the other one isn't quite right, and since this is about opinions, we could discuss forever without coming to a conclusion.
---
Bottom line: Play the game and have fun. Don't let others drag you down. Respect the other's wishes - and that goes both ways - and we'll all keep having fun.
---
Wait for sales to buy HoT and PoF together. DLGamer has it right now for $37. Seeing as that is two expansions worth of game, I don't see how you can get mad at the pricing. \~$18 each for an entire expansion worth of material. 
---
EotM need substantial buffs to wexp but only on weekends to make it at least sometimes interesting place to be. Better than nothing.
---
Nah. To the moon we can go with portals. She's close enough.
---
That's pvp in general. Any game.
---
Yeah they are hard. Either joining an HP train that run through HoT maps on Weekends, or ask for help on the map chat. Most of the time people will come to help you. Good Luck !
---
should still learn how to read first. never once did i say anything about your opinion, and how can a game be my child. why are you arguing with yourself? internet sure is an interesting place
---
That's okay. Just keep breathing.
---
You need to have best gear quality which is harder to obtain as f2p because you have no access to trading post. Then you need infusions which can take a lot of grinding (I believe that certain masteries increase the amount of infusions you get, which is also gated behind expansion).
---
Fractals do have levels so you can gradually get to higher ones eventually (low ones don't need agony infusions so no gear requirement), it just goes faster with upgraded account.
---
Silkears the Fierce 😥
---
left
---
But how can you impove yours skills if you don't play and go afk?
---
It happens to be in a match already lost but in this case i try to engage duel with the players betters than me trying to improve my skills
---
The amount of entitlement in (competitive) games is huge. Some think that they should win or have some items simply because they paid fof the game. Mix that with frustration about literally anything related to whatever you are playing and you get the first to go AFK.
---
I got that after changing some of my email preferences (as to what they should send me) so I just assumed it's more of their spaghetti code and changing an email setting to receive newsletter (yes I want that skin) gave me the same mail as if I'm making a new account so.. /shrug
---
Is this real?
---
There are significantly more "PvE players" in WvW, than the other way around. Are you really that ignorant to that fact?
---
The average WvWer have always been god awful at the game as a whole. This fact has not changed since 2012. They are also the players who have been under the false impression that they are some amazing PvP player who is better than the aforementioned "PvE players" in every way. They are also highly toxic, and for little to no justifiable reason.
---
Yup. Was shown in a dev talk a few minutes ago. It just ended.
---
Yup, was just on a Rezzed livestream about death in writing by ANet.
---
That looks a LOT like a character riding a wyvern at the end there...
---
ooh is that a new mount I see?!
---
that's hot, that's hot
---
The bar at the top shows your progress towards that complete tab. The above image has it at 100%.
---
It looks like Aurene.
---
I'm referring to the map itself. The map is more compact- mirroring the character's reduced size. 
---
This is why I assume that it's comparatively smaller than other maps. Because it's more company.
---
It should be easily accessible then.
---
As so far every trailer post so far had the name of the episode in the title and I'm not sure if official trailer/teaser are counting as a spoiler.
---
no homo
---
Happened to me in bitterfrost when collecting berries. Like oc said having a separate mount keybound and double or triple tapping the keybind works.
---
The Byzantine Empire falls in 1453
---
Use different keybind on a different mount and double or triple tap will save you from logging in and out .
---
No. I refuse.
---

---
What if... it's a map that takes place primarily in the sky? New special ability (like the one in Jahai against the Shatterer).
---
It would of course have a ground-layer too, since not everyone has the griffon.
---
Not much else to go on about from that teaser.
---
Best tip for that section is to use a potion as a stun break.
---
I greatly disagree. Balthazar and Scarlet weren't really side-stories. They were fully fleshed stories and, though the development of their characters had some pretty big issues, they functioned as true antagonists in their respective arcs. During those two arcs, the dragons, even if present, were the sideshow.
---
Joko could have been just as fleshed out as well, and so could have Lazarus (though Caudecus would always have played second fiddle to someone, that someone should have been Lazarus not Balthazar). And those two could have been meaningful threats and villains for the Commander. They may not be fallen gods or world-consuming dragons, but an immortal, conniving lich and an ancient powerful spellcaster of intensive knowledge with cunning manipulating servants would definitely pull as much, if not more, of a threat and plot as Scarlet did.
---
People **will** get tired if the plot is just "dragons, dragons, dragons", and in fact a lot of folks did around HoT, and we had only dealt with two dragons at that point.
---
It really isn't because of people trying to be content creators, it's just the way games are being designed these days. People will adapt to the game design if they continue to play, if the game design is bad and encourages bad behaviour, or at least doesn't punish it, then players will behave badly. The massive problem with GW2 PvP is that you just won't get punished for AFKing, throwing and being a toxic player. The most you will get is a slap on the wrist and that just wont deter anyone.
---
I'm guessing maybe a gargoyle type creature.
---
Full homo
---
Wyverns only have two legs as opposed to the four we see in the video. 
---
Requiem for a Dream-ish music, sounds amazing
---
Snowflakes insisting on running with groups that dont want them, drag them down. I'd rather play with 20 than with 50 where 30 are borderline useless. Regardless no issues with getting players. 
---
Entitled pugs on trash specs refusing to cooperate with the group are high in supply, and there is no demand from my side. Frankly I notice this attitude quickly spreads through the servers. I wonder why.
---
&gt; Pot meet Kettle.
---
Are you an idiot?
---
&gt; ...communicative, organizational...
---
Yes, because hardcore PvE content and sPvP does not. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt; ...political skills...
---
That answers my question.
---
On a more serious note: is there a real explanation? Looking at the bridges of Jahai fortress, the Rihlon section of the Elon river is basically at the highest level possible, and it's still present in Vabbi too, yet Kourna has dried up and there's the huge new Elon Riverbanks in the Crystal Desert. Did we or Kralk do anything to the dam between Episode 3 and 4?
---
I agree. The trampolines and mushrooms are incredibly inconsistent. :(
---
not a wyvern wings aren't attached to the forward legs, looks like a warclaw with wings to me
---
My mind goes to the  [Realm of War](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Fissure_of_Woe), full of the Eternal Army.
---
But ArenaNet devs confirmed shortly after Ep4 that open world maps won't take place outside of Tyria (world). 
---
That's largely because ArenaNet intentionally fed us false information (unreliable narration) and slowly revealed the truth of the situation.
---
Original depiction was more or less what you said, as well as the notion that Elder Dragons were mindless entities that were actively balancing magic from one extreme to another.
---
But over time we've learned that they're intelligent and uncaring about balance, only fulfilling balance due to their situation of six incorrigible and arguably-opposing magic-eaters existing at the same time.
---
&gt;For a while, I've been wondering if/when Kralk will reach the point of being "satisfied," but now it seems it's more likely he'll only return to sleep if he leaves the world with so much less magic in it.
---
That does seem to be the direction for Kralkatorrik. That of all Elder Dragons he's the greediest and would stop at nothing to obtain everything he can reach (whereas the other Elder Dragons have smaller, albeit still world-shattering, goals).
---
Fundamentaly, because GW2 has a shit PvP, practially, because players are sick of this shitfest.
---
So much this
---
Why don't they release things like this through their actual channels instead of this weird half through a twitch stream deal?
---
that's just the spine of kralk
---
like 50% of my Google ads are for gw2... 
---
Kinda sad if you think About how many Players that already bought the game and/or Play it regularily see those ads while potential new Players dont even know the game exists
---
\^What I usually do is try to move on the center of the mushroom/trampoline, then face the character to the direction I want to move, then let it bounce off once more and before the 2nd bounce hold "W" so my character can get the far jump from it.
---
War Eternal - get ready for the timegates....
---
&gt; ...the communication and coordination required to control 50+ people is much different...
---
No, it's really not. What is different is the comprehension capabilities of the average WvWer (more proof of how awful they are as players). ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
All you do is follow a tag and perform the command that is repeated 5-10 times back-to-back because they're too stupid to comprehend the command the 1st time it's mentioned (stack stack stack stack stack stack...might might might might might might...push push push push push push push push).
---
&gt; If you don't understand how political skills effect force cooperation between groups well then I'm not sure what else to say other than maybe stick to small scale stuff because in big scale you are likely to find yourself without allies.
---
I don't think you quite understand what that word means. The only politics involved are when you're actively partaking in match fixing.
---
I've personally lead over 250-300 people weekly in large scale raids across multiple games, including Aion...and they're all the same. Most of the average players present in those raids are the worst players in the game. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that Aion had, on average, better (and much less toxic) players in those large scale encounters than GW2 WvW...and those raids had a lot more at stake than WvW - that speaks volumes about the average WvWer in GW2.
---
No because we know we are getting current events before the episode
---
You're welcome!! Enjoy your weekend
---
So, it looks like Kralkatorrik at the start from behind, then flying beside him, then there's a griffon skin of a dragon/dragon-thing flying around with a pact airship and a Shatterer. Really excited to see what they've done. I'm a little sad that Kralk seems to have been made fully physical where before I really liked the idea that part/most of his "body" was really just a storm stretching to the horizon, etc. Also, I don't see any/much damage from the Aurene fight on him?
---
The name suggests to me that maybe we'll get a hint/resolution of the whole Lyssa/Balthazar thing. Or maybe just some way of trapping Kralkatorrik in an endless battle in the Mists. Regardless, I am psyched to have some sort of a flying battle with Kralkatorrik.
---
I know this isnt a thread about Joko in general, but I just find it interesting that we had a villain actually succeed in a game (even if it was just to set up later on us defeating it) but I mean the extent to which he won all of the dessert. 
---
I never played GW1 so to me everything happening to GW2 is like "starting from scratch", but my understanding of it is that the Jade place is also taken over a bad guy, so Im truly looking forward to see that. It is just nice to see what happens when bad guys win (certainly not for those affected!) because the dynamics are different than "random bad guy wants to take over the world, but we stopped them right before JUST BARELY".
---
Trvialation mode, lol
---
Legendary mount? Well well well..
---
commanders of wvw, is it bashing or is it caring? i have had a couple of overbearing commanders who flip their lid over a few people in a large zerg. they act like they just lost a battle when it is only 1-3 dead. then they just spout things over and over in caps which boils down to "learn to play my game mode you fools" (yes, one com in particular likes to call people fools when they act out of line).
---
If you think, that mirages offer next to nothing, you should direct that comment to ArenaNet as a commander. This IS an MMO and it should offer for each and every class a way to play in a meaningful way in an mmo context. You have my support, because I'd like to spec to be even more useful to a group, even if I do not share your sentiment in the first place.  
---
If you feel that certain specs are not useful to group content in a game centered around group context, that is an underlying issue which should be adressed - not by forcing players to play what they do not want to play, but by giving them a way to contribute, while allowing them to play what they like.
---
Physically it's a western dragon, albeit stubby on the neck. I'd love it to be a gargoyle since they're considered canonically extinct in GW2 and the Elonian ogres resemble wingless gargoyles to me, so I would love to see what GW2's idea of gargoyles looks like.
---
Not to mention, we only arrive in Jahai after Joko is killed, so maybe they started to open it up a bit by then.
---
I cant believe it. After 7 years finally another elder dragon fully modeled.
---
AFAIK they don't, as DX9 shaders are what GW2Hook messes with and the ability to change them/use them is lost upon conversion to DX12
---
I haven't seen /u/megai2 mention it much, I know Arc works, but I'm pretty sure GW2Hook doesn't
---
Their plots were still ultimately dragon related (hence the whole "tired of dragons" feeling), but **they** were the focus. As I said, while present, the dragons took the backstage for those plots. Primordus, Jormag, and Kralkatorrik was the sideshow of Balthazar's plot, and Mordremoth the sideshow of Scarlet's.
---
Looks like it's just going to be floating around, obviously not too much attention given to it since it doesn't even have a flapping animation implemented yet 
---
Will likely just be like the risen dragons and airships flying around Orr zones
---
Ooooh, Sea of Sorrows is my favorite for sure. I hope you enjoy it!
---
The big fuss is that once you've kitted out your character, you can focus on the content that you enjoy playing, not the ones that drop the loot you "need" to update your gear. Also, account-bound ascended armor means that, if I stop liking a class, I can move their armor to another character.
---
[removed]
---
Wouldn't the 2 different shots, with 2 different cameras, help to differentiate that its 2 different dragons? The first dragon looks like Aurene to me based off the tail, and it looks smaller that Kralk.
---
I wouldn't say "exactly", but it certainly holds simularity. But so does Vlast's tail.
---
The main thing, though, is the head. The head looks very different from Aurene's as there is a pretty large horn there.
---
Dude really? I was SO hoping for episode 9. FUCK.
---
I don't deny that much.
---
Because its Rezzed like E3 more people are watching showing it on this could interest people to come in. Also they rarely do this everytime they reveal things like this its on their youtube channel or twitter page. God forbid thry do something new.
---
By playing you still accumulate wealth, skins (fashion wars!) and the most valuable thing: experience with your class. Without gear treadmill any person who really knows his class and has the skill to play it, has equal chance to beat the enemy, without the need to spend endless hours grinding some filler/repeatable content to get the necessary drop.
---
My main contention with that thought is that Kralkatorrik seems a little too idle and unconcerned for it to be a battle scene. Even if he did kill Aurene, **we** are the ones who shot him down and plucked out his eye. I doubt he'd be uncaring if we're flying up to right next to him.
---
War Eternal? Is this the Guild Wars/Aeon's End crossover we never knew we needed?
---
To not waste your entire game time trying to catch up to the newest stat only for an even higher stat to be released next week. Doesn't sound like fun to me.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
gracias
---
Wouldn't surprise me. We might have failed to kill him, but we carved bloody chunks out of his neck and took out his eye before the fight was over. He limped out of that fight, even if he did win.
---
Only question is how fast can he heal, and if we can do anything to pin him down anymore.
---
&gt; What is the point of no gear treadmill?
---
What is the point of gear treadmill? Your answer will help me explain you the answer to your original question.
---
My favourite are the WvW Warclaw achievements Officially Uninvited and Fatal Fangs: repeatable forever, for zero reward.
---
Memes were a mistake.
---
OHHHH-HO-HO bishhh! This was such a great way to wake up! It’s quite thrilling to see most of the body ❤️🔥
---
Keeping up with shifting balance and skill rotations does have an effect on skills, but your right in that its possible nothing you do in those 2 years will make content easier.
---
But on the flip side all of the raids you missed will still be challenging and relevant as well.
---
Ingame reward mount skin is a hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee stretch. 
---
me: stays in baby mode, is unbothered by angry fart cloud
---
hmm, there is another option. With reality becoming as unstable under krakalakins power as it has been, what if the realm of war comes to us instead? It gets spliced into Tyria the way those reality bubbles in Jahai did.
---
Sure, those two years are supposed to be for you, not simply your character.
---
Her: 'I bet he's thinking about other human females'
---
Me: 'Why the hell did I kill a God and 2 Dragons but not achieve Ascension to lvl 81?"
---
&gt; Aurene decayed until she turned brown and ~~Marjory~~Livia raised her as an undead dragon?
---
Obviously fake, Mirage doesn't have Shouts
---
1. The third shot doesn't have that effect, so I figured it was intentional.
---
2. Could be, but his actions seem a little too idle to be "in combat".
---
3. Episode 4 makes multiple comments of The Shatterer being a singular individual. Namely, when it first makes an appearance:
---
Taimi: Commander? What was that?!
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: Kralk sent his lieutenant after us.
---
Taimi: But-that Shatterer is supposed to be dead!
---
How could Taimi know "that Shatterer is supposed to be dead" if there's dozens of Shatterers? How could she know we meant the Shatterer - let alone a dead one - if our only description was "Kralk's lieutenant".
---
Dev comments did the same, suggesting if not outright stating that there was only ever one Shatterer. Episode 4 did retcon that forum comment of there being multiple Shatterers to explain the repetition of the world boss fight. Which isn't too surprising, seeing how ever since Season 1 ended, ArenaNet kept retconning forum comments left and right and eventually just proclaimed "if it isn't in-game, it is semi-canon at best and what's in-game takes priority in what's canon and not".
---
You da MVP.
---
The point is that you can actually take a break when you feel like it and return without having to spend months to gear up all over again (just to be done in time for the next tier of gear that you will need to grind for)
---
Makes me think of the Fissure of Woe and the Eternal battle between Balthazar and his brother =\] Could be relevent?
---
In the dialogue, they're constantly switching between "that Shatterer" and "the Shatterer", while also referring to it as if it's the only Shatterer / lieutenant.
---
There's also [this comment](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/802982/#Comment_802982) by a dev, who talks about the Shatterer getting shot out of the sky multiple times, but keeps the name to a singular.
---
I wouldn't think they'd resurrect her as an undead minion, but she was Branded by Kralk, anyway.
---
Maybe the changes are a side effect of eating Joko, though. Or absorbing some of Balthazar's magic. Or it's from Ascending. Or the color's an effect of the lighting in the zone. Or she's still dead and it's a different dragon or dragon-like creature entirely.
---
I don't really expect the end of the previous ep to stick very hard, though.
---
&gt; the head has horns 
---
So it does. I didn't notice that when I was looking, earlier.
---
How do I join? I’d love to be a part of this!!
---
*Wooo* It's your **3rd Cakeday** j0k0b3t! ^(hug)
---
They also mentioned there was potential for digging into Menzies story in the original POF scope if i recall. 
---
&gt; And they take the backstage if we look at the bigger plot...
---
If by "they" you mean Scarlet and Balthazar, not really. They're the primary antagonists of Season 1 and Season 3/Path of Fire respectively. No ands, ifs, or buts.
---
&gt; The story is about the dragons, if you don't want a story about dragons, go play a different game. It's okay, there's nothing wrong with finding something that interests you. But please don't try to tear apart the story because it doesn't speak to you.
---
What the fuck are you going on about? I'm not tearing the story apart because it deals with dragons constantly.
---
Besides, the "bigger plot" is not the Elder Dragons, it's Glint's Legacy.
---
I like the third option too, but we never get stronger enemies.. Moving from HoT into PoF, there is a clear and visible downgrade in difficulty, that was only masked by increasing the mob density of encounters
---
Taimi going to EOTM in season 1 is certainly canon so can't see why not =\]
---
Ancient Magics mastery actually requires completing the story mission Out of the Shadows in order to unlock it.
---
Other games punish you for leaving early.
---
Taimi will transfer her consciouness into a Seige golem
---
&gt; I think we're going to some dragon land
---
There’s a tree typical from Elonian regions at the end. We might go for the core of the expanded dragon brand.
---
&gt; dessert
---
Yum
---
HYPEEEEEE
---
also I notice that the strings playing in the music is exactly the same as the one from Aurene's Vision in Ep.4
---
Can you explain how that is really any different than any other game's mid difficulty raids though?
---
Gw2 doesn't have raid difficulty tiers and while that is lamentable for some its not a side effect of the lack of gear treadmill.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ziPQe6M.png
---
Plenty of guilds (after all was GW1 a pretty good pvp game) started playing PVP initially but quickly left GW2 bc GW2s pvp isn't good. More or less no one stayed. From hundreds of PVP guilds down to ~ zero. 
---
Some seasons ago you'd also frequently run into teams in pvp. If afk teammates, rude teammates, bad teammates, bad team compositions bothered you there was a simple fix: form your own team. That's not possible anymore.
---
Ah, yeah, I forgot the exact wording, but the point's the same, it's going to take longer than usual so we shouldn't expect it soon.
---
I actually wouldn’t mind *a* new borderland *in theory*. Just not hot on the idea of it being Branded is all. 
---
Omg omg will be battle on a moving dragon like it was once mentioned in the past? Hypeeeee
---

---
&gt; it is that the Jade place is also taken over a bad guy
---
Huh?
---
Does the effect of an infusion changes depending in which item I insert it into? For example if I put it in my weapon, only me weapon will radiate the effect.
---
Or Zhaitan's horns, depending on the angle - could've absorbed a bit of leftover death dragon when she got branded
---
I was seeing this message last night around 11pm local time, which was almost 13 hours ago.
---
the main problem with standard fishing like some other games have is promoting afk farm, witch is something i personally would not like to see in gw2. I like the mini game of fishing, like getting a around with having a decent rod, reel and bites.  
---
I wold much rater prefer other game types to be added to the game, but i can see they adding fishing at some point.
---
Edge of the mists had story based on living world in it because Anet back in season 1 decided every release had to have something to do with Scarlet and the main story. I think we are going to where Kralkatorrik landed at the end of PoF or possibly where he was asleep.
---
Make sense.  I rarely spend much time outside of FoTM or Raids anymore unless there's a new episode so I rarely think about scaling. 
---
&gt; I feel most gamers love fishing
---
No.
---
https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1114198046252777472

On the twitter video none of the glitching occurs (his wings do skip a few frames in the animation though). But I chalk that up to twitch being funky.
---
Just thought I'd flesh out your answer more, sorry if I'm stepping on any toes doing so! :)
---
We have choya butts and mushroom butts to make up for it
---
The point of view might be looking away from the brand/mountain.

&gt; That tree looks like the trees from Maguuma

I’m not so sure. It looks like parts of baobabs.

*squints* Full body kralk???
---
Horizontal progression can become boring, after many hours of game play, another skin or title is not enough to continue playing. 
---
I sent you a pm!
---
A game where you just have fun without always trying to get more ? Heresy.
---
Here is the Twitter version:
---
https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1114198046252777472?s=19
---
This is probably wishful thinking, but War Eternal... kinda sounds like WvW... alliances confirmed?
---
It really depends on how you do it.
---
In some games it's an afk activity, like wow. I despise that way.
---
In other games in a short minigame with little use, like Torchlight. I found that uninteresting.
---
There's also minigames that have some use, like in early Zelda games. You may get one reward and then you can forget about it. That's not to obad, but also boring.
---
And then you have games in which fishing is a whole new thing:
---
* A minigame with skills and techniques to fish, not just pressing 1 button at the right time and that's it, or using a node and waiting. 
---
* With gear that helps catching fish and allows catching different kinds of fish. 
---
* With mechanics related to fishing.
---
* With uses for different results from fishing like cooking recipes. 
---
* With collections and records of your bigges catches.
---
* And reasons to travel the whole world for fishing spots.
---
When it is a full thing, fishing can be fun.  Otherwise it'll be a waste of time.
---
Looks like the glitch was a Twitch thing, [here's a higher quality version that was posted downthread](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1114198046252777472)
---
Yeah I played wow since launch and also gud wars 1. Stuck with wow since that's where my friends were but dabbled in guild wars 1 every once in a while. When I played guild wars 2 I was all "what the hell have I been doing with my life?!" And promptly cancelled my wow sub. Now it's guild wars 2 and I dabble in wow every once in a while. 
---
For a lot of vets though, the game is losing interest because there is nothing to strive towards or anything to really invest time into anymore. It's not an issue for newer players because there is still a great deal of the game to be explored, but for players who have been here since launch, the game is a bit stagnant. The reason for gear treadmills in other games is to give reason for people to invest time. I get it from a newer player perspective, i've been a new player in games that have gear treadmills, and while it was a bit of a defeating feeling, it also gave me a lot to work towards and something to constantly invest my effort into. And when i got it, and an update released with even better gear.. i had something to do again, and it felt rewarding and prestigious to keep my character 'maxed'. I don't mind the horizontal approach, but the game just needs something to push towards besides cosmetics
---
Using a keybind for a chair also works since that is actually another mount ...
---
In league you are punished for disconnects and afk though.
---
My email was confirmed years ago but this showed up for me, too. Logged on without problem and received no email from Anet...
---
That sounds terrible!  Not to mention slightly verbally abusive.  Some people can get very passionate about a game, which is ok.  But "yelling" at the people you're playing with because they aren't as skilled or as passionate as you are, or aren't following your instructions, isn't right.  It's a game.  You win some, you lose some!
---
I wish we could at least see what rank everyone on the map was. I fought a rank 1 player this morning
---
No, the effect is always the same, however only the infusion in your active weapon set will have an effect, infusions in the other weapon set are inactive.
---
So this means we're probably gonna have a sky battle with him, which is pretty cool. 
---
What I'm wondering is who that dragon at the end is. Seems like the commander is riding it. Could be a new character, or maybe it's a placeholder for Aurene in case she does come back somehow and they didn't want to spoil that. 
---
Title and music seem like a reference to Clint Mansell's amazing track [Lux Aeterna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9WoojeTZw)
---
But why is that so infinitely better. If xpac comes once each few years, what is the problem of spending this 30 hours to become at par. Someone who was not playing the game for two years, has to spend much more than 30h to catch up with everything .
---
You are asking the wrong question.
---
The right question is "What it is the point of gear treadmills". The point of those is making old gear useless, so players have to get new gear. 
---
GW2 gives instead access to new stat combinations. So the old gear stays useful, but you also gain new options for new builds.
---
T3 was harder than T4 in my experience as a Chrono. Because of the stacking and the much lower dps. I'd just gear up to t4 and go there. 
---
Hmm, if the model is just intended to be a placeholder for Aurene, then why show it at all? Why go to the trouble of covering up a spoiler when they could just avoid it altogether?
---
It's not "clearly broken" though, it's just the product of applying a 1v1 rating system on a team game with low player population. It's accurate enough in estimating a player's skill given a sufficient number of games played and players to work with.
---
And having to waste time on obtaining obsolete gear isn't boring?
---
Hmm, maybe just thinking about this differently will help you.
---
I'd say that if truly seek completion then this doesn't matter.  You know what you have and haven't completed, and you don't need a uniform GUI for validation.
---
Alternatively, you may just seek visual conformity (e.g., all boxes checked, all colors matching, etc.) - which is entirely different from completionism - in which case you do indeed need to deal with the eyesores, unfortunately.
---
Think it's the song from Aurene's vision 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9imaBe9ICk
---
I dunno, to me it says Balthazar, but that doesn't make sense.
---
Gods being eternal, war being war etc.
---
reminds me of just cause, where you battle on a nuclear bomb XD
---
Vertical progression can become pretty boring too, so that's not a valid point. 
---
Does this mean ep6 next week ? As the trailer usually come one week before the release.
---
There is no penalty in gw2 for leaving a match?
---
Epic elder dragon mount confirmed
---
Yeah that's true. HoT was brutal at release and I loved it.
---
Sounds more Balthazar related to me, which would be odd considering he's gone.
---
A god of war who once had an army of "Eternals"
---
Oh we can use a turret and keep firing it's #1 skill! I know I know, we did that before :P
---
Bloodstone Fen says hello
---
Being toxic - SSD edition. :P
---
&gt; It is if the devs message them and they don't respond
---
I mean this alone makes it look bad. Just think about it, its only okay if you're there and the only way to know is if a dev messages them. 
---
I personally think it should be a punishable thing. When I go somewhere random in the game and I see 10-15 engis with mass turrets one would only assume its a afk farm. You see crap like that is Korean F2P games.
---
Kralkatorrik, I've come to bargain
---
Task complete. Awaiting compensation and praise.
---
&gt; Ummmm, you realize this is Anet right? That scenario seems a bit beyond their capability or imagination. Besides how will we see [spoiler] Aurene's resurrection from here Joko jerky upgrade [\spoiler] if we're running around in the Mists.
---
I wouldn't be so inclined to think in that direction.
---
Firstly, Aurene's resurrection through Joko's magic makes no sense from what we're told (only gods and Elder Dragons give new magic to those who consume their magic; the ED have not restrained themselves from consuming all other types of magic yet never showed multiple abilities before), and is far from guaranteed despite you proclaiming such.
---
Secondly, about a month ago we had this comment:
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/815609/#Comment_815609
---
Which to me pretty heavily implied the solution will be utilizing the nature of the Mists in some manner.
---
&gt; I doubt that they were developing a "dragon world" when the majority of the studio was focused on the cancelled IP prior to the NCSoft Snap.
---
I never said anything about a dragon world. I said dragon homeland. As in some part of the continent where a bunch of non-Elder Dragon dragons live in the wilderness.
---
Like how Cantha has half a dozen types of dragons throughout the continent. Or how there were the bone dragons in GW1 from actual once-living dragons. It would make sense for there to have been or possibly still be species called dragon in the world.
---
Despite the work on two or more other projects (which may or may not have been new IPs), that would have no effect on the existence of a new zone and dragon models being made for said zone with the theme of the zone being "where some non-ED dragons live".
---
&gt; With the latest post from Mike Z I'm more inclined to think they will be re-using and expanding maps that are already released instead of a new map each episode. IMO, the video for this was likely an animation test for one of the earlier story chapters, which is why it is so non-descript. I don't think the mists will he the basis for Episode 6 but hey you never know!
---
I don't see how Mike Z's announcement at all influences the direction of Episode 6, which has been in development for 5+ months prior to the announcement anyways. Besides that, Mike Z's announcement pretty explicitly stated that the map direction thing is for Season 5. This is not yet Season 5.
---
Yeah, FoW might be relevant too (especially as big ending of PoF and Balthazar story), but I'm not sure Menzies is still alive.
---
The first and second scenes seem like they're taken from story instances, I'm guessing the third is from the new open world map.
---
I can't help but get the impression that Kralkatorrik isn't being presented as an antagonist in these scenes. Given the nature of the title, I wonder if a key part of this episode's story will be observing things from Kralkatorrik's PoV both past and present as part of exploring his prophecy.
---
I don't remember if I took part in the beta event.
---
Best content this game has ever seen.
---
So old content is not invalidated by new gear that make them a joke to beat.
---
\#BRANDTHEBORDERLANDS
---
Depends on your outgoing position. If you are a bear bow full signet core ranger there is A LOT to progress.
---
I see you're an owner of the Asshole Awards.
---
Glint's Legacy involvement began with Season 1 and the Zephyrites, though arguably it was involved since Edge of Destiny which predates Zhaitan's plot in technicality. Like Balthazar and Scarlet's plots, it hasn't been at the forefront the entire damn time. But the plot of GW2 is far from "explicitly and solely about Elder Dragons" like you're constantly proclaiming.
---
So what is your opinion then, why are people leaving gw2? Why is there 2% of people online on my flist and I am playing since Gw1 Nightfall. Why did NCSOFT fire almost half of anet. Maybe, because current model is not sustainable and the game needs somekind of combination of vertical and horizontal progression.
---
Saw this happen today. Anet pls
---
Horizontal progression isn't always about skins and titles (cosmetics). New stat combos and runes/sigils open up entirely new ways to play a class and can create new roles which change the meta.
---
Shard of Duskk just lets you toggle between the normal and metal versions of the soundtrack in tribulation mode. The music automatically switches to metal near tribulation clouds, hence the tooltip.

I would not call this basic. I would call this actual fashion, as opposed to the Cosmetic effect overload that we can see most of the time ! Great job!  
---
(says the lad with the Celestial Infusion, lol)
---
The dragon the character is riding has the same or similar animations to the player character. I think it's going to be the new griffon gemstore skin and maybe we get to "fly" on it in the story instance (because Kralkatorrik is present so it's unlikely to be open world).
---
Keep in mind the griffon is a 250 gold journey that not everyone unlocked, and so for any griffon mechanics to be in story instances they would need to "rent" us a "griffon". This is likely the "rent-a-griffon" skin tied to a flying component in the Season 5 climax.
---
"Can become boring" should never be a valid point, regardless
---
Oh yeah the quality is ass for sure, Twitter tends to not have great video resolution. Just thought I'd clear up that the glitchyness is most likely unintentional!
---
I assume they'll put it on youtube sooner or later too.
---
Don't worry. I'll do that. Maybe some Korean people will do that, too, maybe they will listen, maybe not. I'll accommodate to whatever comes along as long as I find a fun experience. 
---
Honestly surprised this hasn't actually happened. If the Asura and Charr teamed up they could probably bang out some mass produced thing like drones with rapid firing dragon spears lol.
---
Let the hype train chuga-chuga-chooo-chooooo! 
---
Just trying to temper expectations. A month ago, barely anyone was working on the game. Speculate away, I just have a hard time believing Anet even knows what GW2 is or where the story left off especially when most of the Narrative staff were let go. I guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
&gt; I think we're going to some dragon land, the mastery will be zone-specific dragon riding in a similar, but more height controlled, manner as griffon mounts. The plot will be either to find a different dragon replacement, or a means to resurrect Aurene.
---
I think it's a griffon skin, but for the story instance (and later, gem store). It can be assumed most players have the core four mounts but many players won't have a griffon. The dragon-like skin is likely a "rent-a-griffon" to allow us to have a way to fight Kralkatorrik in the air. I agree it will have "real flight" (likely exclusive to the story instance) but I don't think it will be a new mount or mastery. It will become a gem store skin.
---
I don't think he said you're doing it for skins/achievements. You just assumed that
---
\*WoodenPotatoes 3 hours analysis intensifies\* 
---
Ahhh thats hot
---
Nah, it'll be completion of Coalescence.
---
I was wondering why it sounded so familiar - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlnIAGacILU
---
I totally agree. I just think, especially in a pvp class that is this complicated, building a chart for all those situations would be a nightmare lol!
---
I mean, the screenshot could be better.
---
The darkness doesn't show if you utilized the textures of the armor with the dyes or if you just dyed them black to avoid it.
---
I like the glow in the dark bits, especially with sylvari.
---
So tip to show off the armor and your race choice would be anywhere with good lighting, but also night time.
---
Thats like saying why don't you pick up your old atari and play pong because you can jump right in. We're talking MMOs because you started a discussion on MMOs and their gear gating practices and then you compare apples to oranges by telling them to go play a completely different genre based on a point they made about content accessibility.
---
&gt;A month ago, barely anyone was working on the game.
---
They did hell of a good job with the first 5 parts of the season if "barely anyone was working on the game" to be honest. 
---
You are aware that the many of the people actually leading the story teams were not laid off, right? So it shouldn't really affect the story itself at all. 
---
Ahh sorry, I got excited 
---
i'm probably wrong on this but the dragon in the background of shot 3 kinda looks like tequatl
---
&gt; A month ago, barely anyone was working on the game.
---
That's a gross overstatement of the situation. They were pulling resources from GW2, yes, but they still had people working on the game. They've been pulling resources since mid-development of Episode 3 at least, resulting in that rather lackluster release, and still managed to make Episode 4 and 5 far superior to before when they were pulling resources.
---
&gt; especially when most of the Narrative staff were let go
---
Aside from Matthew Medina, who from their narrative staff is gone? Bobby Stein's still there afaik, and I didn't hear anything about Connie Griffith or the other known narrative staff being laid off.
---
GvG arena confirmed.
---
There's smoke coming off of various points. I don't know if that's his eye, but there's also smoke coming from his wings and, I think, tail as well.
---
He's just trolling anymore at this point.
---
No, he really isn't big enough to be a map.
---
Large but no. Primordus could be though.
---
Joko wasn't a spirit because he wasn't dead. People can physically enter the Mists, even the Underworld - it's done literally all the time throughout both games, like the raid Hall of Chains. Joko had brought Balthazar into the Underworld physically, and then Balthazar chained Joko up in the Underworld.
---
Joko is no more or less special than the other liches we've fought: Khilbron, The Hunter, Fendi Nin, and even Mazdak the Accursed were all "immortal" liches who were killed due to some exploitation of the fine print of that immortality clause (except The Hunter, that guy's still out there as far as we know).
---
Wow what a meaningful trailer that I'd never saw coming !
---
Only reason players do fractals is good gold per time and Fractal God. Maybe two guilds in entire game play them for fun. 
---
I suggest you brush up on your Warcraft lore if you think that. ;o)
---
I like both but i honestly think the left one fits better. 
---
So meta changed for 3 guilds which still didnt quit. Nice.
---
Vertical progression and levelling are both terrible systems. Give the player new and interesting abilities and challenges, not some number that blocks progression.
---
Thanks for all those links, proves and resources you provide.
---
well it already looks more exciting than the disappointment that the last episode was
---
It would be cool to see some inquest driven by a desire to never, ever let it happen again instead of just psychotic mad scientists all the time
---
gw2hook/reshade need patches due to not full dx9 api implementation in dx12 proxy.
---
I bet to sell copies of PoF kind of like when HoT came out and they added gliding to wvw..
---
There is no need for Aurene to come back. She already exists in Caithe.
---
They also said that Lake Doric would never be a map (from what multiple people have told me) and here we are...
---
because losing 300-500 vs 50-500 makes no difference so it doesn't matter if you idle or not, granted you know that you'll lose.
---
and dcing is not that common, but ofc it happens for many reasons.
---
I very much agree. I feel like, pacing-wise, it would hurt the story if we immediately kill kralk after the loss of ep5. And I really hope it will take two to three more episodes before we actually kill him. Doesn't have to mean nothing but brand maps until then. 
---
Gotta upvote to get Anet attention 
---
Connie was let go and is now at Sucker Punch studio's. It is pretty obvious (to most people) that the Studio's attention was elsewhere and not on GW2. Even Jessica Price's and an anonymous Dev stated that. Sure take it with a grain of salt but it does make sense, at least to me.  I don't understand how that is hyperbole. If anything, an elaborate theory of the "Dragon World" is the type of speculation hyperbole that leads to the constant disappointment IMO of course. 
---
Speculation is a guess, but it should have some basis in fact and I'm sorry but the fact is Anet was not focused exclusively on GW2 after PoF. Now that NCSoft removed the distraction, look how much is getting done. Of course only the people at the studio know what really happened and I too am guessing. Again I'll say, we'll have to wait and see.
---
Almost P2W if you think about it.
---
I've never used it near tribulation clouds, but my first guess is that the clouds still reset the music even if it's already playing the song that the cloud wants to play, so that could sound weird.
---
If you wish to rush those 7 levels you can do the world bosses train that are always up on LFG, they will give you experience, materials, some gold, specially Tequatl.
---
No, the person you are replying to is correct:
---
&gt;After that, the Current Activities Team has a release that will build toward the Season 4 finale.
---
We are getting something before Ep 6. 
---
To everyone saying that thats not Aurene because of the skin color and horns and lack of crystals, its still PLAUSIBLE that that is her. 
---
For one, Jokos magic allows for self ressurectagion. She also has Zhaitanic magic which she has yet to display. Shes only managed to display her natural brand magic and Baltahzars Mists traveling powers.
---
Its not implausible for her to ressurect through death magic which further scars her. She becomes far more leathery and grey due to her death.
---
But thats just a theory. A GAME THEORY!!
---
The Jade palace is in South cantha where shiro killed the emperor
---
&gt;  I don't understand how that is hyperbole.
---
"barely anyone was working on the game" and "most of the narrative staff were let go" is basically the same as saying the game was put into maintenance mode while they were working on the other projects. It very clearly wasn't because they produced both Episodes 4 and 5 in that time. And two people being laid off isn't the same as "most of an entire team" in most situations.
---
&gt; If anything, an elaborate theory of the "Dragon World" is the type of speculation hyperbole that leads to the constant disappointment IMO of course.
---
That statement itself is hyperbole, ironically. You should re-read my post because, as I say for the second time, I never said "dragon world". I said dragon *homeland*. As in *a singular zone that touches where dragons live in the world of Tyria.* Not some full new world or some crazy ass shit like that.
---
Similar to how north of Ascalon there is a place called "charr homeland".
---
And a new zone is far from unexpected for Episode 6.
---
&gt; Speculation is a guess, but it should have some basis in fact and I'm sorry but the fact is Anet was not focused exclusively on GW2 after PoF.
---
I never said Anet was focused exclusively on GW2. But not being focused exclusively on something isn't the same as barely paying any attention to it.
---
&gt; Now that NCSoft removed the distraction, look how much is getting done.
---
What's gotten done? Warclaw? That was done before the layoffs. SAB? Again, done before the layoffs. Episode 6? By the time the layoffs happened, it would be in polishing mode.
---
Game development isn't so simple that you can produce such results in under a month. This shit that we're getting now has been in development when "ArenaNet barely paid attention to GW2" (as you say).
---
Youre trying way too hard.
---
Now, if the ancient Jotun had designed it, I'd be much more willing to believe in its accuracy.
---
&gt;Maybe, because current model is not sustainable and the game needs  somekind of combination of vertical and horizontal progression.
---
Did that save Wildstar? Did it save developers at Blizzard who were laid off? How about the team at Trion working on Rift or ArcheAge? How's SWTOR doing? You don't like horizontal progression so you're choosing to blame it for a perceived decline in GW2; but, the evidence doesn't suggest a cause/effect relationship.
---
Content is king. People are leaving WoW because the content is crap. People routinely let their subscriptions to FFXIV lapse in between MSQ releases because there's no content. Those are the two largest MMOs today with vertical progression and they are showing the same patterns. 
---
In the case of WoW, I actually alluded to their vertical progression system has become completely meaningless. Why bother doing the farm raids when you can just come back at the start of the next raid tier and immediately catch up to where you need to be? Does the slightly bigger number on the same skills actually make people feel stronger against the stronger content?  I got better gear; but, the new bosses are just as tough as the old one because the vertical progression to get there was meaningless.
---
People come back to WoW for the new content. People come back to FFXIV for the new content. Same for GW2; it's the content, not the style of progression, that drives behavior.
---
Draw in more PvE players, so the self proclaimed WvWers can let out all their toxicity towards them? I don't know if that's such a great idea.
---
What if... One of Balthazar's Eternals helps us out? Oh please, make that happen!
---
Got the prompt last night.  Never got an email.  And I do successfully get all other emails on that account.  (Even bought gems last night.)
---
Yes. Though in-game it's often called Mouth of Mordremoth. It's been confirmed a few times over since PoF that is Mordremoth's core body, the one that we also saw at the end of Season 1 opening its mouth.
---
I was suffering so much cuz of this during my legendary back grinding. As soon as I was done with The Ascension I quit PvP and never looked back.
---
GW2 PvP is amazing, but.. Afk, offline, bots, lame ranking system, ignorant devs and much more..
---
I'm in complete agreement. I'd actually like to venture into the mists, regain ourselves and get answers that we need right now, and then come back and tackle this threat. Though with the teaser out, you can see tons of pact airships floating about, so i'm sure we'll see another big fight and finish up this purple menace
---
Using GW2 launchy buddy. I have invested on them that time when the game was on sale for $10 prior to the release of the first expansion Heart of Thorns. With launch buddy I don't have to manually type the username and password since it's stored in the app.  
---
All I have to do is click the account and launch it. Also it can multi login which allows me to launch multiple accounts simultaneously. I usually launch 3 accounts at a time and doing the daily login on all 13 only takes about less than 15 minutes unless it's the 28th day to harvest the mats (22-23 mystic coins and 55 Large Crafting Bags) each account. 
---
Yep! GW2 launchbuddy is heaven sent for me.
---
I'm gearing alac renegade, but [from what I've read](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade) it needs quite a bit of boon duration (78%) to keep up Alac and Might and that nearly full diviner's setup has the fractal potion factored in. It will also be used in raids. With leadership runes, conc sigils and my current mishmash of BD gear I can get just below 50% BD. My wife's just finished the missing pieces to fill out Power SLB and condi BS plus her account is much younger, so she doesn't have quite the asc chests/currency to spin up her Guardian quickly. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Narrative_Team
---
&gt; Personally, I'd be happy even if they start putting this small image on top of achievements again.
---
This, I don't know why they even removed it in the first place.
---
Same thing about displaying AP in the list, now you need to open each achievement one by one.
---
Nerfing the warclaw won't do anything, they need to address the buildings one by one already.
---
Yes that one time the game was on sale for $10 was the best. I regret not buying more because seriously the investment I made that day has returned the profit so much more already with daily login rewards and I have time. I look at the ascended mats that are profitable to craft then craft and sell them to the market.
---
I suck at pvp.. what's wrong with 2 thieves?
---
wait till august anniversary to 50% off
---
&gt; Moving from HoT into PoF, there is a clear and visible downgrade in difficulty
---
because the feedback they received following HoT was that it was too hard so they tried to dial it back for PoF.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the tip. Was thinking of trying again this weekend so might grab a few potions first.
---
A zone like that would be awesome. Sign me for that ride.
---
Ah yes
---
We're getting a Deathwing fight i feel....
---
New secret wings upgrade for the warclaw then.
---
Good thoughts.  I agree, except I'd change #3.  I think their policy of not informing players of individual results is good overall.  Often times you can tell yourself.
---
However, I like the concept of #3.  So I'd change it to be public communication about both of the other things you mentioned followed by a nice big number of accounts that got sanctioned.  That helps a lot to change people's mindset.  Plus they see evidence of it pretty quickly if they do both of your other options.
---
awww what a sweet little ball of fur
---
Thieves are usually bad in long team fights, so they either 2vs1 and help someone get their kill quick or go for side nodes. With 2 on your team, you will be bound to have blown out team fights if opponents have good tanks and the thieves are too scared to join in.
---
Either way...this isn't the absolute truth, is just what i think those people might be thinking when they give up, as i had multiple matches where i won with 3 thieves even.
---
Living world stories and wvw are entire separate and should honestly be kept that way.
---
As for just rebalancing.... I doubt that will ever happen....
---
&gt; Ok, I am not the first to say that GW2 was in maintenance mode since PoF. FFS even Deroir and Teapot have said it.
---
Games in maintenance mode don't get DLCs every 3 months. Just because a few people said it, doesn't make it true.
---
I'm not denying there was less focus on GW2, which was what prompted these opinions, but it was 100% never in maintenance mode. GW1 is in maintenance mode, GW2 is not.
---
&gt; I agree, a new map will likely come for episode 6 but I doubt that will happen with Season 5.
---
I never said otherwise. Though I will, as I think Season 5 will be more focused on adding maps the same way Season 2 did - adding only a couple maps, expanding them over time with releases. E.g., Season 5 is likely to provide 2-3 larger maps, instead of 6 medium-sized maps.
---
&gt; It was Jessica Price, a Dev that worked at Anet, who said they had very little support for the game during Season 4 and we're told to act as if they were fully staffed.
---
She didn't say there was very little support. She said they were pulling support from GW2. There's a bit of a difference, as it doesn't specify the amount of support.
---
But given that this pulling of support happened between Episode 2 and 3's releases, as evident by dev statements and common sense deduction, that means Episodes 4 and 5 would be as heavily hit as Episode 6 (if not more than since the original scope required more than they could do). So Episode 6 should be no less than what Episodes 4 and 5 got.
---
&gt; You should also read the road map of what's coming now that the Studio is working on the game. Just saying.
---
I did. But none of that pertains to Episode 6, or the now canceled non-GW2 projects, which are solely what we've spoken about.
---
&gt; Also, do you honestly think that there wasn't a strong reason for NCSoft (who is traditionally hands off with all there subsidiaries) to make a demand of Anet to reduce staff and cancel two projects and focus on GW2? That was the first time NCSoft publicly intervined in Anet operations.
---
Sure there was a "strong" reason. They wanted profits, and/or their shareholders demanded profits. So they did layoffs and canceled development projects to focus on improving and maintaining current projects because current projects actually get active and immediate profits while projects in development only take away from profits. NCSoft is far from the first to do this, and they outright stated that this was their reasoning, though you'd have to read a bit between the lines.
---
Greedy rich CEOs and shareholders demanded more money now, so they fuck over employee livelihood and their consumers a bit. Old story told a million times since the dawn of civilization.
---
It warms my heart to know that Ramona gets to go on so many adventures with you. &lt;3
---
Do you know that heart where you have to shoot cannonballs to a wall then pick the rubble and throw it in the river? Its bottom right of a Ascalon map, Diessa Plateau I think
---
Chances are season 5 won’t be related to PoF as much as S4 was, so a change in shirt doesn’t mean an expansion. Wonder if we could speculate any places based on the colour 
---
Nope, no effect at all
---
How do I encounter him?
---
Well Anet DID remove all rewards from HJ so all the HJers left the game or moved to ranked. That doesn't, however, imply that HJers are the ones AFKing. We don't do that because we play for FUN and are generally happy to just PLAY at all. 
---
Not sure if they're new; it's hard to tell the background with the level of quality, but Living World uses a similar colour scheme.
---
You may be right but look from the diffrent view - GW, HoT, And PoF had an diffrent motive of tishirt (colours etc) - this one is similar to the previous speculations that the next expansion could be connected with Buble dragon and underwater areas. 
---
I mean Anet did completely  neglect their game mode for yours...
---
FINALLY, A DRAGON GRIFFON SKIN
---
If I wanted to do fishing I’d just go back to RuneScape... /s
---
I like the idea of fishing and how it can tie in with the chef thing. Might even be the LWS5 mastery track. But who knows...
---
T1 2 can be done with just accesories. Save up only for +9 infusions as they are imo best bang for your buck and will let you reach 50+ ar with just trinkets and weapons. T3 you may want to look at infusing and attuning your rings  now to push higher scales. T4 lower scales can be done with less than 150 but 150 is recommended so you will need armor. 99 AR or 108 if you attune backpack is the max you will get with weapons and trinkets (+9 AR infusion used). By the time you reach that number you should have dropped a few pieces of asc armour and should stat swap if needed. 
---
Yeah idk that I would call this a map break exactly. The only part it really skips anyways is the queen bee area and its all done through legitimate jumps.
---
I would consider map breaking to be abusing collision bugs to get through walls and floors / leaps.
---
It is a non-canon story from GW april fool's that became canon because of the easter egg.
---
Basically, every year that other universe ripples back into GW. But GW goes back to normal after we defeat the Annihilator and Annihilator 2.0 golems, and nobody remembers anything because the timeline changed.
---
I saw this title and tried to go into the thread with an open mind but holy shit nearly everything about your suggestions sounds awful. It doesn't sound like you really playo or "get" WvW.
---
Bloodfin lake in Iron Marches, look towards the wall and you will find players.
---
Developers do move em around etc to see if they are fully afk or not. But I see a couple who literally stick around for weeks. So while I hope they take action towards it I can't say for certain that they do.
---
I wouldn't recommend trying it.
---
just no. if there is gonna be terrain changes to maps, it's better gonna be overdue fixes. DBL already takes PvE too far, and we've already seen during S1 how welcome and useful LW content is in wvw (hint: it isn't).
---
whatewver happens, I hope we get that dragon as a skin. I've been wanting it since we found out about the griffon.
---
Don't worry I didn't. I gave him a chance and when he still refused to discuss in good faith I didn't respond a second time.
---

---
You can fish for our comrades.
---
Everybody who need to join them for achievements... :P
---
Not really. With PoF they revamped their logo to look desserty in all their trailers and shirts. While I agree that its a LONG stretch, its not harebrained.
---
Wow, that cloud scared The White out of Gandalf. 
---
Final boss of the Dragon's Stand meta. [This guy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Mouth_of_Mordremoth.jpg).
---
Its red since PoF with a desserty background. Not close to even being like it is on the shirt.
---
Anet can't afford to allocate resources on anything but their LS, everything else is pretty much maintenance mode.
---
Boat mount??
---
How heartwarming. Visit Desert Highlands often, Connie might love the carrots? 
---
Yeah, but those could be older LW shirts, or just LWS5 even.
---
This guy speaks for all vets, btw
---
It actually looks like the same anims as a Griffon. Which I don't mind, cause I love the griffon and have wanted a dragon skin for it forever.
---
Maybe not. It's completely unique to every other skin (it's a dragon, not a griffon) and it definitely would be an awesome optional reward.
---
I actually only used the whip to stunlock two bears in W2Z1. While it's basically better with boomerang now, because of the double stun, it also stuck in walls, which can be annoying. 
---
However, I will definitely try it at yeta and wizard, sounds pretty helpful.
---
Also please don’t suggest that I freeze myself and then get unfrozen after reset.  I’m not faking for that again! 
---
But they weren't the totality of their civilization, which is what it can often feel like now.
---
In the instance you kill his mind at the same time the pact (aka the Dragon Stand Meta Event) takes out the body.  It says it in the instance, but is easily missed.  I know I missed it my first play thru.  Will warn you the end of the DS Meta is choppy because of rushed time when released, but it's fun.
---
&gt; the Commander is riding Caithe
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It would help to know what class you play.
---
&gt; Wonder if we could speculate any places based on the colour
---
The pattern looks kinda like water to me. 
---
Or approaching something from underneath? Curvature at the top might suggest a moon/planetoid/structure in the Mists?
---
You are literally ignorant though, because you meet the criteria of lacking knowledge on the subject (you admit to it yourself), and sadly we currently live in a world where most people are ignorant of that stuff, and it’s only if you want to be a good informed part of that conversation (you could’ve just not replied or said anything), then you should go out of your own way to educate yourself. It’s okay to be from a conservative background as you can’t change that, but you can change your ignorance by reading more (etc). 
---
I only say it’s up to you because every person is living their own struggles and has no obligation to educate someone else, it’s all readily available online from people who are willing to educate and it’s on you to find it. Reddit is used worldwide by many different people, so the people getting upset by what you said could be from anywhere in the world, so already dealing with severe prejudice and lack of support, it’s not their job to educate you in an unrelated subreddit, that is solely on you if you wish to be a positive part of those conversations. You were wrong and that was pointed out, it’s unfortunate it was by downvotes and friction, but you have to have some empathy and realise why that is - if you got called names and faced prejudice your whole life, you wouldn’t react kindly to someone doing that in a day &amp; age where information is readily available, as it usually comes from people who want to upset you, not someone who’s literally just ignorant. 
---
For a second there I thought I was watching a Rathalos or Rathian with that tail shot...

&gt;_&gt; Now I want a mod of Kralka for MHW

Did you know that just because someone finds your approach and actions repulsive and thus has a conflicting opinion/view to yours, does not necessarily mean they are part of the opposition that you so viciously despise?
---
I'm going to bet that I have more experience in WvW (and the rest of the game for that matter) than you, yet I'm not blind to the toxicity of the average WvWer...who are at best...average players (just like how the most toxic players in raids, fractals, and open world are the average ones), but also have a false sense of superiority over those they label as "PvE players", but you will think I am part of the said "PvE player" because I find your actions and opinion on the WvW matter...despicable.
---
Yeah, thank you. Could find it anywhere. Looks like we will get something akin awakened invasion or other events spread on map.
---
I know, Kralk battles all over the Tyria, calling it now! New world boss!
---
I think it's because they are a playable race now. Back in GW1 they were "only" NPCs.
---
Did the difficulty of dungeons change recently or change in general depending on party members? Since the start of the game I always got on fine in AC, some deaths here and there but overall we always managed to do it fairly fast. But the past few days me and my party of randomers keep getting trashed and everyone gets annoyed and leaves. Am I after running out of luck and haven't gotten a party to carry us to victory or has something changed? 
---
pretty sure its home instance cat vs home instance cat.
---
It's not really for a single character. I like to use one outfit for one character and depending on the weapon that fits, I'll put it on a class
---
You sir, get a kudos.
---
Grima's back should have been the Awakening stage in smash
---
Renegade for perma alacrity m8 new meta.
---
Oh that's a great idea, thank you. Might do that over the weekend see what I like at 80
---
Thank you for the builds, good to know I can't go wrong with any of those professions
---
We won't fly _ON_ Aurene. We will fly _WITH_ Aurene. (Dinotopia reference.)
---
u mean new 2k gems griffon skin
---
Nah, that's just arenanet tshirts. I don't think it means anything for GW2.
---
Yeah it looks like water! 
---
Group healing and defensive support together is best served as Firebrand. You can apply lots of Aegis and Protection to allies while serving up some quality burning.
---
Now if your goal isn't exactly to buff but to stop people from dying while doing damage, you want Blood support Scourge with Mercy runes and Shaman/Plaguedoctor stats. This will allow you to deal damage shielding allies from attacks, healing them passively overtime, and stopping them from dying completely as not only do you prevent bleedouts while you are present, but you can also pull multiple downed players together and revive them all within a few seconds simultaneously.
---
Kralk's back was literally a mountain range in gw1.
---
[Yeah... about that](https://imgur.com/a/4fWysVg)...
---
&gt;  If we weren't so starved for content then I doubt a change of clothes would be noticed.
---
You underestimate gaming communities.
---
Looks green-ish. A little like Jade....
---
  
---
CANTHA CONFIRMED!!!  
---
Necromances are immune to normal healing while in shroud.
---
But they can still life steal and gain health.
---
Unfortunately, GW2's skill and upgrade descriptions tend to be rather inconsistent. So we do not know whether that "Restore your health" is "Healing" or "Health gain" without resting.
---
The only way to know for sure is testing.
---
It's just a griffon model.
---
Also in fairness to the Charr, they were living in Ascalon first, then the humans came and took it. They took it back.
---
Yeah. "Overload" means that being near a tribulation cloud will force the metal music.
---
Resto in pesto and may you one day become the besto
---
I won’t be able to hugely advice them cause I’m not in the game too long but you’re right I’ll give them the advice that I know, thanks 
---
Didn't we watch him die in pof?
---
https://i.imgur.com/xy81f1G.png is there a hidden achievement?
---
Tbh, that would be a really awesome griffon skin.
---
There's nothing wrong with decent, unrigged RNG. Claiming it's abusive to people with mental issues is a little far out, because if that issue is an active problem, lootboxes are not going to be their main concern.
---
"Bad for all gamers" - You say that like you've asked all of them. Have you, or are you just pushing this as part of your own opinion? 
---
"Just because you choose to waste your money" - Highly subjective. That's not even debatable on whether or not it is. I could just tell you you're wasting your time here.
---
"I think everything should be ala cart where you buy what you want" - Uh yeah, there's a market for that. Most things that aren't account-bound end up there. No it's not direct cash to item, but you can get there.
---
War Eternal is an epic song by Arch Enemy
---
Give it a blast :D
---
If you wish to do personal story together without re-doing various instances for same stages of each-others p.s, make sure to select same options all the time
---
What I like about the three of you choosing the same Order is you'll get to earn progress through story from level 30 to 60 together, and it'll be faster since you skip the other two Orders. 
---
However, to experience more of the story and more of the lore, it may be nice to each pick a different Order. It will mean you'll earn Story progress separately, though you should still be able to help each other. It'll be slower overall but you'll all get more experience.
---
The story converges at level 60 anyways, so either Path you take you'll be able to progress together from there.
---
A new gemstore skin ^_^
---
I like the feeling of "git gut" rather than grind mindlessly. I love that fractals/raids/pvp/wvw are about being good rather than about - "i had time to grind for this". This is ehat keeps me in game. 
---
Rotations change, yes. Builds change. In gw2 you take a day, regear and learn new stuff, no grind needed. Any good game does it to keep things fresh (take league). Part of it is understanding new situation and figuring out new meta yourself.  Its fun, if that is your thing. 
---
Best coaches I ever had respected their team and never swore at us. 
---
Worst coach I ever had did cuss at us and got written up for sexism so there ya go. 
---
Players who are missing the achievement Seeker of Truth and Knowledge can talk to Priestess Adhara at the Temple of Kormir to restore it.
---
I have yes, even been back to the room to double check
---
Really looks like that character from the manga Berserk...
---
I don't think you can say the Charr won the war in Ascalon, even though the humans very clearly lost.  The humans only "lost" Ascalon due to the kings insanity really.  The Foe fire decimated all Charr invaders and left ghosts which the Charr cant beat. 
---
 Up until rather recently,  the Charr were still attacking Ebonhawke, and failing to advance.  Only the events from Ghosts of Ascalon did the assault stop, and that's partly due to the Charr leaderships wanting the war with the humans to stop because they knew it wasn't going anywhere.  The Charr weren't even able to successfully take Ebonhawke when Kralk woke up and waves of branded stormed the walls.  
---
Just my two cents! Sorry for that dragging on.
---
A spear can be used by 7 of 9 classes... :)
---
I thought that was considered a problem back in season 1 days, or is it just worse now?
---
It was retconned on the last Living Story episode, though. It's not nearly as huge now, sadly. 
---
"Meta event" refers to event chains that are given a singular name, via a brown box in the event UI area that also describes the state of the event chain: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta_event
---
Not every meta event has a world boss, and not every world boss is part of a meta. But there is often a large overlap between the two.
---
I don't want to oversell it to you.  Most of these builds don't do much damage and aren't actively sought after by Raid and T4 Fractal PUGs.
---
That said, I think Support Scrappers are currently underrated by the community and you shouldn't overlook them, especially if the other support classes aren't your cup of tea.
---
Yeah I hate unrewarding HJs too 
---
This is where I expect Balthazar to burst out of Krakaltorrik with his sword in hand.
---
More context? Is it just a weapon skin you found in the DAT that is unreleased so we don’t know where the asset is used?
---
Nah, Warclaw is too fun to use to remove, we just have to fix the buildings instead.
---
If only! I wish they had ported them over as a high HoM reward.
---
I'm on mobile so can't see properly, but is there any indication it is actually the player character on the mount? Could very well be a new enemy type. 
---
I indeed bought the entire magi set from karma vendor (exotic) for my ele just to test out in T1 groups, and what I actually found out was, I want to delete the character LOL! As what you said bro, I think I should consider either giving back the power stuff back to my ele or make viper for a scourge instead. 
---
It's almost as if they just randomly added something to WvW that has no place in it whatsoever.
---
Can you top up people back to full health repeatedly like all the other healers can? No. 
---
Can you prevent damage and heal them a little? Yes.
---
That's what i meant from scourge doesn't really heal. You can go in expecting to heal someone at 10% -&gt; 100%, but you can prevent someone at 100% from taking possibly their whole health in damage, and maybe top them back upto 50% (outside of ressing them)
---
Wrong!
---
I don't have a "weird vendetta against WvW players".
---
I have a problem with idiots...irrelevant of what gamemode they want to believe they represent.
---
Only viable when they figure out how to sell wvw building skins in the gem store.
---
I'm not even commanding in wvw, I just understand the frustration but I'm not vocal about it since I don't see the point of it towards the new players. I'd rather explain and answer questions than yell and tell them to improve. 
---
You said that 1-3 dead can rally half enemy squad, which isn't true because 1 dead ally will rally only 1 enemy. 
---
We are going to fight at krals back, we kill him and then fall.. he fall in cantha opening season 5.
---
Or not.
---
If u listen close they empower before fights.
---
It is quite clearly Kralk himself... notice the face
---
How old was it?
---
Go in game, enter wvw, type /t in chat to get access to team chat and ask there. It's friday night so wvw should be pretty populated.
---
The screen glitch in the beginning is quite obviously just an encoding glitch from the twitch stream...
---
This is a wonderful tribute 
---
Doesn't work while in shroud. I was running them after the rework, and swapped to runes of the wurm after being disappointed. (last tested around wintersday) 
---
He will be forever in your heart &lt;3
---
Also, I wish I could make my bunny a mount too but they don't have Lionhead skins yet. The closest one is the Arctic Jerboa with its cheek fluffs, but there is a Grand Lion Griffon Skin. Hmm...  
---
*Laugh in 250 years of extreme deflation in Tyria.*
---
100% a mount skin.
---
Looks like it doesn't.  Tbh you're better off just relying on Blighter's Boon and using a might-spam build instead.
---
The actual trailer will be.
---
This was a teaser at a well know gaming event that Arenanet is attending.
---
damn if that is a skin i have to consider dumping my halloween griffon.. and i really like that naked cat
---
pretty sure its just gunna be a new griffon skin. 
---
If I 'progress' any more horizontally, I'll need to buy a bigger chair.
---
THAT'S NOSFERATU ZODD.
---
If Berserk is leaking over Guild Wars I can't wait for the Eclipse, specially since we're stuck in the Elfheim arc since time immemorial.
---
It isn't the full trailer, no. Arenanet just did a panel at a games expo, and showed this at the end.
---
However, it's 26 seconds long not 2.

If you are going to make two more characters each pick the same one, it time, do a different one next time, whispers is my favorite

Well, remember, we had a couple of Inquest join our group, Gorrik and Blish.

I think if you use magi gear you wont see any worth of heal tempest, but if you use harriers, you might be pleased. Magi gear gives you more healing, but heal tempest already puts out super high amounts of heal, so the heal stats are kind of wasted. On the other hand, harrier gear lets you give 10 people perm might, fury, protection, as well as extend raid alacrity and quickness (in case your chronos arent getting good uptime...hint: they probably arent). The only real difference between druid and tempest is spirits (in exchange for perm prot) if you dont run soulbeast, glyph if you do. SO technically, if you are super optimized and everyone is near maximum DPS for their class, druid pulls out ahead; if your raid is fairly middle ground--which it likely is--then tempest and druid are fairly similar--maybe tempest is even better if your quickness/alacrity classes arent keeping uptime high.
---
This might be close, not sure:

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Light
---
The level 40 section of the orders are completely different from each other.
---
The pro is you get to see all three sides of the story.
---
The con is that you will then need to *do* all 3 sides of the story, as progress cannot be shared.
---
I would personally each do one, but if you want to rush to the end that is the slower choice.
---
Well do I have some good news for you!
---
This is actually great, in my hours of casual wvw I would love to see new skins on the buildings. This would actually really spice up things when I am trying to take over enemy buildings. I really hate fighting but I enjoy the scenery in wvw. I wish it was more fleshed out.
---
What class are you playing?
---
Great to hear this. I will pass this on to our team.
---
Shiro played himself honestly.
---
The xunlai took all of the Platinum with them severely deflating the amount of coin in the market!
---
K bud
---
Melandru's light shine upon this adorable bun.
---
Reminds me of the weapon skin set that was both black and white.
---
Also it really looks like that Warclaw so maybe just for this map you can make some sort of collection to get wings for it and be able to fly instead of gliding. When i write it, it feels a bit far fetched but still it really looks like the warclaw.
---
It's just my old PvP PTSD kicking in. People used to pick the tiniest asurans available just so that you couldn't see their animations and skill windups. Can't stand the little critters since then. 
---
But anyway. I WANT BERSERKER ARMOUR
---
Yes.
---
Season 5 is supposed to replace an expansion, so I expect new themes and new login screens.
---
Hundreds of players with hundreds of Elder Dragon Mordemoths
---
I stare at people clothes all day and night.
---
Your lop was super cute. Lost my dwarf a few years backs and I still wake up wondering if she needs fed. 
---
Best bunny.
---
And WvW players did not like the EotM and it became a champ bag farm and leveling map until they removed xp. And the events from scarlet was terrible because they kept keeps and towers contested constantly and it was a huzzle to WvW and pretty annoying. 
---
WvW players always asked for less PvE and more WvW.
---
I feel like all the reasons they explain at the start as to why Aurene's death was supposed to have an impact are the exact reason's why her death is so implausible.
---
Aurene's story started in Season 2 (the egg the Master of Peace was trying to protect) and played a larger role as things progressed, to the point that all of GW2's narrative eggs are in this one basket - Aurene.
---
They've built Aurene this whole time to be the answer to the problem (hinting that Glint could replace an Elder Dragon, exploring that killing Elder Dragons without a replacement is a problem, even Vlast's story was actually about Aurene, or more specifically - an attempt to make Aurene's story about us (so the story still feels like our story, Vlast had no champion, he was alone, that's why we failed, Aurene has us).
---
The problem with putting the entire narrative into this one basket is it's flat out implausible when they kill Aurene. They spent most of GW2's life building her and her story up, they explored three other paths of what could happen to her (Glint's death, Vlast's death, Shatterer's servitude) and the story was so hyper focused on Aurene, it's implausible that they would just throw all that plot away.
---
Death has weight as an idea for us in the real world because of two things. One is that it's permanent - when you die there is no resurrection, it's forever. Final moments with a person are truly final moments, there is no reunion in the Mists, there is no resurrection - if someone dies after having an argument with a loved one, that loved one has to live with that as their final moment. The second thing that makes death so powerful in real life is we don't know what happens next. This was broken long ago in GW2, ghosts and the ability to travel to the underworld, communing with the dead (Alastia Crowe in the personal story is summoned to get information, I think Marjory may have done it in her short story). More egregiously, they pierce this veil with Braham and Eir - their brief reunion when Eir and Snaff pop out of the mists as ghosts shatters the permanency of death in Tyria (Braham and Eir can potentially have final words and come to terms with their relationship, it also shows Eir continuing to be a hero in the mists, begging the question - what has changed for her if she's still fighting?). Finally there are two cases of casual resurrection the story lately - Joko, who is undead and mysteriously never dies, and the player character who dies in PoF but I still can't figure out why. This cheapened death in Tyria.
---
So now we have Aurene, who's story is too big to fail, and a gradual and consistent erosion of death in Tyria - specifically at a time when they wanted to create the most impactful death in the story, but personally I found it less than Tybalt's, Eir's, Trahearne's or even Belinda's deaths because when they all died death had more power in the story, but more importantly - none of them were too big to die.
---
So while I walked away from HoT's resolution believing Trahearne was gone, I watched Aurene's death and I know her story doesn't end there. I believe Aurene's death about as much as I believed my own during the PoF story.
---
Taimi could have died and I would have believed it, literally everyone other than Aurene was up for grabs, but Aurene has the entire narrative on her shoulders atm and there is nowhere else for the plot to go - she has to return to finish the story they've been telling since Season 2. The only way they could have sold Aurene's death is if they somehow make it so she sacrifices herself to accomplish her mission (which is difficult when her mission is to live to succeed the Elder Dragons). Anything else is an interlude.
---
What ArenaNet have done with Path of Fire and Season 4 is make death feel cheap in Tyria. Braham gets to have a reuinion with his estranged mother who tragically died, Eir gets to aide Glint and have a second chance at her greatest failure, the player dies and is revived very casual, Joko takes immortality to comical levels, and now Aurene's story is doing a "fake out" with a story that has been building since 2014 and has already explored the failed paths (Vlast, Glint and the Shatterer) so it makes 0 narrative sense to have another path end here.
---
I know the last episode had an impact on some people, but I personally believe the current story (before Aurene died) has made death cheap in Tyria and even if Aurene's death is permanent, it is much weaker of a concept than in the real world. I also think Aurene is the wrong character to leverage for a believable death - it'd be like killing Superman in Season 2 of Superman when we know there will be a Season 3 - obviously the title character isn't death, and Aurena has basically become the title character of GW2.
---
Of the options they have for the story, I believe temporarily killing Aurene is one of the weaker ones.
---
I suppose it will be a story-exclusive mount
---
You think tempest is a good raid healer?
---
There is literally a warning stating that you will lose all your buffs when you enter SAB.
---
Oh God, the ingredients! My heart! It's melting!
---
Give the person responsible for it our best, will you?
---
it literally warns you on entry
---
SAB warns you you’ll loose all buffs and boosts when you enter. 
---
ANet: We need to remove the jump on Warclaws. 
---
Also ANet: Lets make a Warclaw with wings!
---
You can jump in to air and fire keep without mounts (and with ofc) and have been for years. Still not fixed and this was two expacs ago.
---
Nosferatu Zod?
---
That is the whole point. To learn something new, to adjust to new stats and figure out how to play it well. GW2 is skillbased and you will never gank someone because you have better gear, you will only do it because you are good at what you are doing which should be the thing, not to swap out the gear you earned every half a year or so to get next tier with a few more stats and bosses with a bit more vitality and toughness. That if anything is pointless. It should be about skills.
---
Look in the mirror mate. What do you see? &gt;!Spoiler alert: an idiot!&lt;
---
20 minutes for a 30s teaser, thats the minimum for WP

(great video) &lt;3

They're blue, so I can conclude that Expansion 3 will be based around Smurfs.
---
Whynotboth.jpg
---
Magi staff tempest: By far the best healer in the game.
---
Harrier Warhorn tempest: Permanent protection, fury and 25 might for 10 players, good blinds, super strong boon extention!!! Druid can run lingering light to compensate the lower healing of warhorn tempest since might is covered.
---
Copypasted from my comment on the video, not exactly proofread, bit of a wall of text, bit of a ramble, bit of tin-foil speculation
---
I feel like we've been getting implications ever since Guild Wars 1 that there is (or was?) a dragon race on Tyria, distinct from the Elder Dragons. They're always described as crazy magical forces of nature, but at the same time we have drakes and wyverns that are somehow biologically related to dragons. Not to mention the saltspray/canthan dragon, the undead Orrian dragons, and Glint herself.
---
The thing is, as far as I'm aware Primordus and Mordremoth? are the only Elder Dragons that create their own minions - the others corrupt existing life. So Zhaitan must've gotten his dragon champion corpses somewhere, just as Vizier Khilbron did in GW1, and as Kralkatorrik branded Glint. Perhaps she (and by extension her children) are just a form of purified Branded now, their connection to crystals coming from Kralk instead of being a base aspect of their race pre-branding. So wherever this season is taking us, maybe it's a "lost world" sort of refuge for the last of the dragons, nearly extinct due to what essentially amounts to overhunting by the Elder Dragons themselves?
---
An entire race of creatures that seem to be universally powerful enough to serve as dragon champions is a pretty serious resource, especially if they have some inherent ability to consume/store/use magic. At that point though, some of this concept hinges on what the origins of the actual Elder Dragons are - did they start as regular little dragons, or do they just take that form? And if that's the case, could ANYTHING become an Elder Dragon, even if it's not a regular dragon, as long as it's capable of storing that much magic? Were the Six the Elder Dragons of the planet the humans and forgotten come from?
---
Step 1: hoard 1000 raw materials
---
Step 2: start refining all of them
---
Step 3: take a 20 minute bio break while watching an episode of your favourite series
---
Step 4: select the next 1000 materials
---
Step 5: repeat from step 2
---
And then we have to deal with that thing, and when we deal with it we are going to wake up bubbles.
---
I blame you u/Cybot_G
---
That's as many as four tens!
---
Honestly the best thing they could do is release an Aurene branded mount that you can acquire after you finish episode 6 with different mastery skills than that if the griffin. Let’s say we ride Aurene into battle and she wins against kralk and we win. then when she gets his power and goes Godzilla size you get the ability get one of Aurenes dragon minions with the same skill you used when you were riding her for the story and that’s the dragon in this video
---
"ANYTHING CAN CHANGE!"
---
... sorry, I couldn't hold back :^)
---
It never served a purpose for WvW players ever except for guilds fighting other guilds. Other then that people who play WvW is not going to play that in EotM. 
---
So if you want the map to be something then you need to ask for something else then making it competative to WvW by up the rewards for it. Because that would hurt WvW rather then anything else, because people would pick EotM to farm ranks and pips which is not healthy for WvW.
---
So ask for something else to farm on that map that is not wvw related and you might find people listening. 
---
&gt; And if that's the case, could ANYTHING become an Elder Dragon, even if it's not a regular dragon, as long as it's capable of storing that much magic?
---
Something something secret about Ascension that can only be shared between dragons.
---
Are we really complaining about Ad spaces on sites now?
---
&gt; a dragon race on Tyria
---
I would think so, yes. For one there are the salt spray dragons in Cantha, of which Kuunavang is one. Theres also Albax, another salt spray dragon. Both can speak.
---
In central Tyria there are bone dragons, the decayed remains of ancient dragons that once roamed Tyria and were ressurected by the Lich.
---
There is more than plenty evidence that dragons once roamed freely on Tyria long before the gods arrived and brought humanity with them.
---
Probably long before any of the other elder races.
---
&gt; could ANYTHING become an Elder Dragon
---
No. Heavily implied that that is not the case. Theyre called Elder DRAGONs for a reason. When a human absorbed enough magic they didnt become an Elder Dragon but a god instead.
---
All living creatures without an innate ability to consume magic and store it go insane and eventually just die.
---
Even the Commander started to go crazy for a time before they managed to cure their intoxication. (This was the focus of the anomaly side story) And in states of chaos, magic can be potentially deadly by just touching it which is why Aurene shares her powers with the Commander which allows them to absorb the volatile magic that is now present in the world (mechanically only in LWS 4 maps)
---
The AB meta map runs was my first taste of public full map participation in HoT. I was blown away how everyone coordinated and made it happen without having to be in one guild or on voice chat.
---
Then I zoned into Dragon Stand and that raised the notch even higher
---
where is the  vloud in 22?
---
Or tattoo it under your armpit.
---
Or all three!
---
Why not? Zhaitan had them. It could also be armor fitted on her. Its not implausible.
---
Did you talk to the stump? You can test to make sure you have the song by leaving the hut and playing the song right outside it. If a face doesn't appear on the rock wall next to it then it didn't work. 
---
That is not possible, since it's impossible to keep players in all objectives at all times.  WvW can't be stripped of PvE because it's intrinsic to it by its very nature.  WvW is both PvE and PvP, and it cannot exist without both as it is.  
---
You can't replace a NPCs with players, for example. Even if you had a way to take over the role of a lord, giving the player lord health and power or something like that, then that would be exploitable by 'spies', allowing them to get themselves killed easily by their friends on the enemy team.   
---
NPCs have fixed behaviors, so they are also a way to control some of the rules of the game.  
---
The problem isn't having more or less PvE in WvW. It's how that PvE is done.  
---
If it's not done right, then it isn't that different from an event in any PvE map, and pretty much a pointless nuisance.   
---
I can't say I'm fond of the 'musical chairs' game that happens sometimes that makes players avoid each other and focus on capturing enemy objectives to farm WXP, hardly ever defending anything but keeps. That's also another kind of pure PvE nonsense we need to discourage.    
---
But if this added PvE is done well, you can actually get more PvP, as contradictory as that may sound, if it's done in a way that willl encourage players to spread across the map and bring them together to the same objectives, which would in turn cause more PvP.  
---
For example, there could be Bounties that players can take that give bonus rewards for taking or defending a location.  
---
Each map could get a set of 5 bounties at any given time, and only a fixed number of players would be able to take each. At one time the Bounty NPC of two the the teams could give a bounty to up to 20 players to take a tower, while the NPC of the 3rd team would give a bounty to defend it, and so we'll likely have players from 3 teams gathering at that tower for some fun fighting. Another bounty could be given only to up to 5 players, and send them to a camp, another for a single player, and send them to a sentry and have a smaller scale fight.   
---
If bounties are timed and they can't be taken consecutively by the same group, and give juicy amounts of warscore, then we would not have zergs taking turns with each bounty, they'll have to choose and spread or they'll get less warscore than enemy teams if they do spread.
---
Another example of more PvP by adding more PvE would be having a 4th NPC faction (for example, Aetherblades) that will take any objective players leave undefended for too long, returning it to the gray team.  Give each supply line from a camp to a keep a meta-event that rewards capture and defense against other players and the 4th faction.

Sticking around a supply route scouting and escorting dolyaks is horribly boring for most players, since there's usually not much to do if no players come around, and if they come, it's often large zergs.  Have NPCs attacking it every now and then, and that'll break the monotony, so it'll be more likely that a few players would stick around each supply route.

Then you just need to make this 4th faction into cowards that will teleport away when there's more than 1 player faction around, leaving the fight to be between players only so they can focus on PvP.   
---
And of course there has to be better rewards for keeping all these supply lines, not just mostly on capture and pip-ticks.

With more PvE added in a way like this, there would be more players spreading all over, and with an increased likelihood of having a player in any given location at any given time, in turn when other players get to those locations, it'll be more likely they'll meat each other and fight.  
---
Then you could even have a Mercenary system that allows players to join this 4th faction and enter maps outside their match instead going to the Edge of the Mists when all of their maps are full, or maybe even join teams of you own color in different matches when they are outnumbered.

We have to be realist. PvE will never, ever leave WvW. But it doesn't have to be boring, and it can be done in a way that actually encourages PvP.  The difficult part is figuring out ways to do so. But there's definitely ways.

I don't see Druids topping anything above 90% otherwise I'd have a better uptime of Sholarrune in my combatloggs.

Not being a WoW player, I decided to look up the Deathwing fight after seeing multiple people bring it up here. TBH, watching that, it felt like a complete version of the Zhaitan fight. Battling dragons and minions on a giant airship full of turrets, using a giant magical laser beam to bring down the dragon. Then with two different phases of fighting on the dragon's back in the sky and attacking it after it got brought down.
---
Makes me feel like if ArenaNet had the time needed to finish the Zhaitan fight, we would have gotten something along the lines of Deathwing.
---
I rather not have a "Zhaitan fight 2.0" tbh. Even if it got the epicness Zhaitan's fight deserved.
