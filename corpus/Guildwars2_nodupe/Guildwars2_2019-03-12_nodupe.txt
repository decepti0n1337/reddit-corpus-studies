I guess we will see during the week then exactly?  Since it was only showing a few days after reset.

---
---
i put together a pretty in-depth explanation for it a while ago which you can check here: [link](https://tgdm.github.io/) (text guide, some video examples)
---

---
a lot of the gameplay itself boils down to experience. you have to get familiar with anticipating enemy movements, knowing ally movements, and when/where to use your abilities. a badly placed meteor shower means that your damage in a fight is going to be pretty bad, but trying to force your way into casting one at all could also get you killed. you also need to get acquainted with how and when you should weave different attunements.
---
the downside to weaver is that unless you're really good with it, your damage output is often going to be overshadowed by other damage builds which also bring a lot more utility (rev/scourge). scourge is a really easy role to play with a huge utility incentive between barriers, cleanses, and strips and plays more frontline. rev is another good utility/damage role but can be a little weird to play when the terrain isn't favorable.
---
Your welcome \^\_\_\^
---
Yes, anything above 15k dps is viable. Trust me, Im PvE veteran.
---
Is tarir still an often done meta? Goddamn its been so long 
---
I would have liked to see the warclaw unlocked in wvw for just one point in the skill, and have the achievement unlock it for non wvw zones.

This is better for the long run than any of the farming methods. I’ve also got quite a few ascended boxes out of the reward track loot boxes. I’d say it is at least worth it to run the track until you have the 3 marks to get a stat selectable weapon/armor piece per season. Some of the best rewards in the game of you spend your queue time profitably.
---
Hmm actually wish if they cascade the world maps into categories: core, S3, HoT, S3, PoF, S4

---
Your best protection as a weaver is being aggressive and applying more pressure on enemy ranged than them applying to you. This is why Etheri said you should be skirmishing enemy ranged.
---
If enemy is busy healing/blowing their defensive cooldowns they ain't doing dmg to you. On top of that when bad players get pressured they run to safety leaving enemy players to freecast them afterwards.
---
"The car(POF) came with a steering wheel(Griffin) but it's gonna cost another 2.5k to install(buy) it. Or I gotta do it myself and that's a lot of time learning(farming)."  
---
Whenever I dive down, I can't dive back up without losing speed, but these videos show otherwise
---
Basically just swap scepter for longbow and don't worry about changing anything else. You'll lose a bit of damage but gain range and boatloads of cc.
---
i could have sworn there was a pattern to them.  like the World Boss chain or stuff like the Queensdale champ train.
---
Where you could jump from map to map with only a small amount of downtime.  but it looks like none of them line up quite like that.
---
It's this. The last morsel of magic left in the world attracted all of them. 
---
I really love this idea. I recently did a sweep of my account to update everything and replace all my level 80’s underwater gear with BIS that I could manage. With the uw headgear it’s either a level 70 rare (iirc) or ascended. No easily obtainable level 80 exotic or even rare. Really annoying. 
---
Damn we need more shitposts
---
Need advice for spvp, recently got promoted into gold tier 1, while i can hold out fine in 1vs1, i constantly find myself getting destroyed by the other team when they +1 on me. btw i main a spellbreaker warrior.
---
 if i see a 2nd guy running over to back up the guy im fighting, how should i react? Should i sakadoodle outta there or try to my best to keep them from decapping for like 10 seconds before dying.
---
 Also what should i do when a guy with bunker build rush over to a point i just decapped, i feel fighting them is a complete waste of time, since i can never kill them on my own, should i just let them have the point, or fight them until a buddy comes to help?
---
To further add on to this, unlike BDO (that actually has a very simplistic and kinda dumb combat system, that despite having many abilities you resort to a very simple rotation in most classes), Gw2 in comparison has a much more intricate combat system. Only by playing and studying it you truly start to appreciate what it has to offer. 
---
One other, big big thing, is that balance, despite not being perfect, is far from the atrocities of BDO (where balance is used to forcibly make players change their classes and re-grind all the gear). Atm, except for WvW, class variety is a thing in both PvE and PvP (WvW right now has a certain unbalance mainly related to 2 of the elite specs from PoF that hopefully will be fixed someday). 
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/condition/
---
For raids, it's more than viable but needs a stationary boss and you need to make sure your tank has more than 1120 toughness.  In raids I have also played Dagger/focus for a bit more range in earth. With weave self it is also easily the hardest rotation on weaver right now I think. Out of weave self loop isn't hard to figure out. 
---
I also find it great fun in open world from time to time. I play basically any combo of sword daggers and focus. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafXCTvVfDIVwwUVqfhY6jg
---
Shetsa does the current benchmark vid and you can also find a Dagger rotation vid there from a couple(?) of months back. 
---
No no, the blood and goo goes to the blood and goo rooms in the mystic forge. Meticulously organised by professional skritt. They're not actually used in the manufacturing of the legendary weapon. They're just traded.
---
Now why Zommoros wants a room full of goo is another question entirely. I don't want to know.
---
I quit. Honestly it seems like anet really wants roamers to quit anyway but yeah the mount was the final nail. My roam guild raged out for good after all these years :/
---
I play with longbow DH, [here](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQFATlsAhChYVQwIIQQELxDWVAYLNAkLg9vFoVI4e9oA-jRBSwAUU+FV9na6AAs/wIlgAA-e) is my build.
---
I used Spirit weapons because most utility skills are melee and they are not synergetic with the long range that longbow gives. Sword of Justice gives AoE, Hammer of Wisdom gives a knockdown.
---
Rune of the Ogre or any other rune that gives pets work because they can tank enemies while you snipe from afar. 
---
Yes you can jump between them, right now my internal meta timer is messed up cause of daylight saving time but TD starts at :30 and AB is 30 minutes after that at :00 DS resets 30 minutes after AB and VB nightfall starts 45 minutes after AB
---
sorry if that’s confusing but figure out when ab is starting on your local time and it starts every 2 hours  and then you can memorize the start time of all the hot metas
---
I know lots of people as you do about flying in WoW, so I'm not trying to dis your perspective (and I certainly don't want to start THAT argument over here!), but no flying in any game has ever beat the delight I feel when my druid in WoW turns into a bird and zips around. Including gliding and flying in GW2.
---
Maybe if I could actually turn into the griffon in GW2 instead of just ride it, it'd give me that same charge. 
---
Don't get me wrong, GW2 is head and shoulders above other games when it comes to mounts, but there's just something about the shape shifting that does it for me.
---
What weapons so you use in option 1?
---
I would choose guardian and maybe use marauder stats, it's like berserker but a little less dps for some more HP. I used to be a long time warrior main but I didn't find bannerslave fun and the DPS was mediocre, spellbreaker was the final straw for me. i share your opinion in regards to armour but i've found that necro is the class for me, despite the light armour, more survivable than guardian and warrior combined while doing more dps than warrior and a little less than guardian. in a perfect world it would be a death knight with heavy armour but this world is far from perfect.
---
This is around the northeastern corner of the domain of vabbi   
---
It exists already, and it's called the [Charr Car](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charr_Car_Tactic).
---
Here are the [free-to-play restrictions](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF).  If the expansions are pocket-change for you, I would recommend buying them as soon as you know you'll stick with the game.  If the expansions are expensive for you, then maybe wait until you reach level 80/finish the original personal story.
---
We just had a significant balance patch less than a week ago so the dust is still settling, but all classes are *viable* in every game mode.  Certain classes are more optimal in certain modes, but the game is very alt-friendly so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Guild Wars 2 is also very solo-friendly.  You'll be able to complete your personal story on your own, and open-world events are dynamically co-op so other player are like playing with friends.
---
Yes please.  JPs are so much better when you know where to go, but its tough to do - rather than blind jumps and guessing if the thing you are jumping on counts as a platform or not.
---
I just did the paths to Blue Catmander and Yellow Catmander in WvW, and it's horrible.  I'm not sure how anyone ever discovered them since its blind jumps and blind drops to get to either.
---
My girlfriend and I also named our cat [Rox](https://imgur.com/Kv0DGHf.jpg) after Rox in-game. Neither of us have made her in-game yet though, but now we'll have to.
---
When we told the vet her name was Rox, they thought we named her Rocks and gave us weird looks.
---
It's good to know there are other Rox's roaming earth!
---
Thank you :)
---
I'll have to do that next then!
---
1. Never been f2p so I can't answer that. But if you buy the expansions you get a lvl80 max lvl boost. Buy I'd highly recommend leveling from 1-80 on your first character. 
---
2. Short summary, it's very diverse. There's no trinity in Gw2. (no, dps, tank, healer) if anything. Most classes do everything with alot of support/utility abilities. Which encourages teamwork.  Some classes are still better than others in certain aspects but there's alot of diffrent builds. Gw2 has always been a good mesh with classes being both dps/support.
---
3. You can solo the entire leveling experience, but you'll always run into random players in pve to help you in events (otherwise known as live quests) as for dungeons, you can solo them but only if you're geared and experienced but if you need a party usually it's very quick to have a "looking for group" option ready. For raids, it's almost impossible and are intented for parties however raids is end game content you won't touch until you're confident.
---
I'm on my phone too, wrote everything on a whim lol. 
---
Want me to list all the ways Anet has broken promises and any kind of potential the game had? I did not think so.
---
[removed]
---
I'd be willing to bet immediately/some time after this year's Super Adventure Box ends.
---
Thanks all. You confirmed what I thought was happening. Back to the drawing board I guess.
---
I don’t agree with this analogy. It’s more like the car (PoF) came with the steering wheel (FOUR MOUNTS) but for an additional $20, you can upgrade it to a time traveling DeLorean.
---
I didn't buy HoT or PoF until I was already level 80, and I honestly don't think I would've wanted to do anything differently. You can't buy much off the trading post as a F2P player, but when you're leveling, that doesn't really matter. Also, it sounds like you're fairly busy- I think it's nice, if you haven't decided how much you want to play this game, to not feel obligated to because you've paid for it. Once you hit max level, if you want to keep going (that is, playing the story, getting masteries, trying elite specs, and maybe raiding), you will need to purchase at least one expansion, but you really don't need expansion stuff when you're leveling your first character. (note: you never *need* to purchase the expansions to play the game at all. You can run around with a max-level character on a f2p account as long as you want.) There's plenty to do in Core Tyria (the F2P areas). 
---
The only time I'd suggest buying the expansions right off the bat is if you had a friend you wanted to be playing with who already had mounts and gliding. 
---
&gt;If you do play wvw it can be done in 15 min
---
Bullshit. I did it on the second day it came out and it took 8 hours just to claim a keep on any map, including edge of the mists.
---
I dunno man, warclaw has been great so far.
---
At least one month out, possibly two. They’ve shut their office down twice in the last month, due to inclement weather and layoffs. I’m hoping the community is patient, as delays are somewhat likely with this episode. 
---
How long is the permanent Armistice Bastion pass expected to stay around for? I'm considering buying it, but I don't want to buy it until there's maybe Shared Inventory Slots going on sale first.
---
i know the max rank level in wvw is 20k, is there a max rank level in spvp?
---
knowing anet it probably won't stick out for too long&gt;\_&gt;  i feel shared inventory sale probably won't be back until last quarter this year during the anniversary
---
Wait for the Pass to pop up in the “going away soon” section, but until then, check every day in case shared inventory slots go onto the daily sale
---
Taking everything that is said by devs as a "promise" is why ANet does not communicate as much any more...because...people, like you, are idiots.
---
I really wish they'd find a better way to dish out the lore for the game.  Bobby Stein and the people under him really seem to have gotten a lot better with the story but I think their way of delivering it could be a lot better.  Its too spread out and leaves big holes that most people I know tend to seem to ignore anything outside the main storyline.
---
&gt; I just did the paths to Blue Catmander and Yellow Catmander in WvW, and it's horrible.
---
It sucked even with triple portal Chrono (RIP). Hard to return a few times to get the home instance cats. So glad to be done with them!
---
Highest WvW rank is 10,000. Stops giving anything after that. For sPvP the last rank name is Dragon at 80 and anything past that just rewards the normal rank rewards. I am not aware of a limit on the rank and from GW2Efficiency it's showing the top rank at 1,153 and top .5% at 500.
---
Now I just imagine them all standing their next to each other after finishing the magic up and mordy just being like “you guys want to take a nap now?” And they all agree
---
Honestly this is probably the best way. Basically *every* support mechanic in this game requires people to stick together, so they'll just need a little ... convincing. 
---
This is the most adorable charr I’ve ever seen!
---
&gt;  That's not a design choice that's...that's world vs world
---
It's a design choice that this is wvw.
---
&gt; If you're a straggler solo running back to a fight and you get jumped by 5 people and have an un-enjoyable time with it, you're saying the game designers should make it so that can't happen?
---
I'm saying "it's like war" is not a real justification for that. Maybe you can justify it, I don't really have an opinion either way, but "it's like war" is not a good argument.
---
How does playing on a VPN help with your connection? Genuine question
---
I've never gotten one from there.... but I swear I'm the luckiest guy ever when it comes to getting keys from map completion. I get them more often than not. So it balances out in the end I guess.
---
Chalice of Tears is the best JP!!
---
No jaggies
---
Every starting area for each race has an already unlocked waypoint that you can find on the map, should suffice as a bit of a shortcut.  
---
Scourge is the wheelchair that can carry even the most braindead groups to victory

Oh my god.

Yeah flying was heapsnof fun when you first get it! But thinking about it now, it was way OP- just get on your mount, and you can instantly vertically ascend to the top of the map, then go wherever you want.
---
Actually I feel the same way about the springer mount. It's jumps are sooo high that it just cheapens any kind of jumping puzzle or even just staircases
---
I'm getting 300ms (350ms without VPN before latency issues). It's also more stable without much spiking, though will still spike from time to time.
---
Even at 350ms last time I was able to raid, do fractal CMs and PvP comfortably. Oh, one very noticeable difference is that with VPN I can finally partake in zerg vs zerg in WvW. Without VPN my latency will spike to 2k  during mega zerg fights and literally become sitting duck.
---
As with 3 out of 4 releases yes. We’re used to it by now.
---
Thought I'd be able to finish this before I left for a trip. I'll have to finish it up when I get back. 
---
It's PvE and not raids, so go with whatever you wanna play. That's what the game is all about.
---
ikr, i got 2 exotic breathers for 2 character i use a lot, and even if i planned to get them everything ascended or legendary, i still don't want to change those breathers because i don't want to trash them.
---
It's not a confirmed drop but it's not that rare either. I got mine after about 5 mins of actively killing guards, on both my main and alt account. I heard players saying they've spent up to 20mins for one. 
---
Do you have autoloot? On my main I didn't even realise I got it till I checked my bag. On my alt it was looted manually. 
---
Sounds like an auctioneer is on the comms. 
---
I made it through chalice of tears - aptly named - but searing ascent was the bane of me. happily its checkpoints aren't/weren't required, and i'd already gotten the mastery point for it by TPing to someone at the end. Much respect for those who actually managed to get it.  
---
I followed the dulfy guide to find where to go (no hope in hell, otherwise), but there's one bit where you need all three charges of your druid magic to get to the next checkpoint, and i just \*\*could. not. do it.\*\* I tried something absurd like 19 times and every time i missed the stupid pull, which had to be done while gliding, around a sharp corner, up to a spot above you with a low ceiling... every damn time, i hit my head and fell to the ground below, and with no oakheart essence charges remaining there's no recourse but to go back to the checkpoint and do it all over.  
---
I respect that people want to be challenged but i really despise the kind of 'challenge' where failure resets your progress or forces you to goo back to an earlier point. Idk if mounts are now useable in this JP (this was pre-PoF) but i'm not going to dignify that "puzzle" with a reattempt even if they are.
---
I have to admit, I was one of those who fell for this. On the other hand, after a few minutes we did manage to rout the group on the tower and hunt them all down shortly afterward. But one of the bodies lying there in the video was probably me. 
---
Your painting is awesome! I do not know if it's too much to dream about but I would be very happy if [A.Net](https://A.Net) brought us a Shogun's theme (with samurais, shinobis, ninjas, ronins...) in future expansion. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
oh our commander went afk to answer a phone call lmfao. we expected to stay there for at least 15 more minutes
---
just a tip for future reference, if an enemy breaks a wall. Leave it open. never fully close an enemy inside a tower.
---
Yeah it progresses without consuming because I didn't eat the stuff on my main until finishing the collection, just to be safe. 
---
Had to consume them for my alt though for the skirmish tickets.
---
I agree that abadon's ascent is a lot more fun than the other 2. Is it hard though? No.  
---
  
---
Don't get me wrong, it is a lot of fun and I wish they kept making intuitive jps like this but the difficult could have been upped a bit.
---
1. As a "trying out" experience, the f2p is great. It's a mostly solo experience but the universe is really addictive and in general, I love that you get experience for doing pretty much anything. Exploring, side quests, helping people, etc. And it scales with your level, too, so helping lower level people still gives you a pretty good amount of xp. As others have mentioned, buying the expansions will give you some "comfort" - bigger inventory (the f2p inventory is quite.. limited, let's be honest) and things like that. I was f2p until lvl \~55, at which point  I was hooked and decided to buy expansions. I don't regret it one bit. Once you reach level 80, the expansions are really where it's at. Basically, in the current state of the game, getting lvl 80 is just like finishing a tutorial, kind of? That's where the real stuff begins. Levelling masteries, farming the best armors/weapons (which are basically all expansion stuff, even though you regularly have to do something for them in the original zones).
---
2. Game balance reaaallly depends on what you like to do. If you're talking pve, balance is pretty good. There are no "bad" classes, there are differences of course and some classes are more desirable than others, but unless you're talking real high level, optimized content (such as raids), it's really not that demanding. As others have mentioned, there is no "trinity" of dps/tanks/healers, to an extent. In open world pve, you can pretty much play anything.
---
3. The solo experience is the best I've ever seen in an mmo imo. There is no group-based skill, it's all zone. Whether you're teamed up with people or not, they can benefit from your buffs/heals. You also very easily get credit for just about anything. Someone fighting a boss for an event or bounty as you're passing by? You just stop for a second, help them out, kill it quickly and you also get credit. It just takes a few attacks to tag a mob and get the event reward, so that's pretty great in general. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
One thing worth mentioning as well is that the GW2 community is by far the most helpful I've ever seen. People, complete strangers, go out of their way to help you as a noob and I've literally had random people just help me out for 1 or 2 hours without expecting or even accepting anything in return because they were just happy to help. That's not to say that EVERYONE will help, and there is nastiness in the game just like any other game, but on average it is by FAR the most helpful community I've seen in my gaming life. 
---
I started the game 3 months ago, by the way.
---
Getting a trailer today and episode next week would be living the dream but my realistic self says it ain't happening. It's been 2+ months since the latest (delayed too) chapter released.
---
That was the last JP added to the game. You can easily tell when certain devs got moved off GW2 when you know what they primarily worked on. 
---
Then probably full inventory or didn't drop yet. Thanks! Will keep trying!
---
That there are entire forests in game but as for crafting we only can cut down small saplings to get wood.
---
Thank you! Added your information to my edit.
---
I stutter to much to be an auctioneer :\^(
---
Lost precipice is a lot more fun because of its verticality. Great for Griffin flying 
---
I didn't know that. I always hated that JP and had to have a mesmer guildie hold my hand through it. Updated my post to include what you wrote. Thank you!
---
Yeah, it takes time. Maybe it should be easier, I don't know. I'm somewhat undecided on that part. Comparing it to the masteries for the rest of the game, I still think it is easy. All you have to do is partake in events. Sooner or later you'll have your tower, you'll have your keep and camps. Then, in the worst case, all you have to do is keep your participation up, capturing camps. Even a newbie without the warclaw can do that. You will make progress. And once you have the mount, it's even easier. Slow, but easier. All you need is get ranks. 
---
I'm still working on my HoT masteries and have not made any progress in the last weeks. Of course the essential stuff is long finished, but the rest can only be done by completing adventures, and doing collections. The former can be quite hard, the latter takes a lot of time.
---
So compared to that, I'd say the Warclaw is easy to get and easy to level up. 
---
Wait what skill break thosevagain /s
---
So when you click the first time on the left-hand side of the crafting panel (names of all items you can &amp; cannot craft), the right-hand side detail panel opens.
---
Clicking on any of the ingredients on the right-hand side opens a second right-hand side box. You simply click on the border of the buried right-hand side box to return to it.
---
Very much this. 
---
And then there are those who hate roamers for picking them off as they run to their zerg. And the warclaw is a long overdue god sent for them to outrun the evil roamers because fights in a massively open scene are apparently "unacceptable" and almost "abusive". 
---
At this point I DO question if they are aware of the fact WvW is a form of PvP (with a mix of PvE, yes) and frankly quite an organic one. With that in mind, no you cant always win because that fundamentally defies the basis of PvP and anything that involves competition. And before anyone tries to jump out with the good o' "wvw is not a competitive game mode", it IS competitive in the sense that it involves a winning side and a losing side to function. Therefore to complain about roamers being an unfair part of WvW and "ruins your fun" is basically complaining about the risk of losing in PvP by essence, and it does sound silly now, doesnt it? 
---
Love it, hate it or ignore it, these are all part of the good, bad and ugly of WvW. If this is off putting enough for an individual to complain so much about WvW.....perhaps they should switch to PvP for a fairly more controlled environment. 
---
These are my 2 cents on the topic of warclaw as someone who has been both a roamer and a zerggling over the past 6 years. I have noticed a trend of redditors down voting any comments discussion that remotely deviates from the "war mount is great, it let's me live" echo and that honestly annoys me to no end. 
---
So thank you for pointing this out as it is a fact check ppl really needed and more overdue than the warclaw. 
---
Any chance character slots, salvage-o-matic or bank tabs go on sale anytime soon?
---
Hello there, mesmer question: How does the Feedback utility work? Do you place it on top of archer and the arrows bounce back to the archer (arrows bounce inside bubble). Or do you place it over yourself and all arrows bounce back to some direction (arrows bounce off the bubble)? :) Thanks
---
This is acrually the reason they did not announce the griffon.
---
They knew alot of people would take a long time to gather the 250g, so they did not announce it.
---
PoF came with 4 announced mounts, the griffon was just extra.
---
Well the main reason me (and others early on) didn't think elona either was due to NCSoft making them remove the elona and cantha district from divinity which they turned into the giant hole. I still hope for cantha like mad as I started the first gw during fractions and we already know dragons where also on that continent so it's likely one of the elders is there. 
---
Yes they are isolated but there's still story new faction ruling the exiling of Kurzick and Luxon I think there was a mass tengu exodus though I'm vague on that one. I'd even like to think the dragon had something to so with shiros power as it seems odd one man transformed a sea to jade, a forest to stone, and could even corrupt people into monstrosities.
---
No that wasn't him. The guy you are thinking of was the main and original JP creator, but he didn't have a hand in Abaddon's.

1. Was an F2P player for 2 months here. It's a fantastic game and if you have friends, it becomes a lot more fun. While the xpac's elite specs do make you hella powerful with certain classes, playing the f2p game is certainly a blast till you get to level 80. I think it's a valuable experience to play f2p at first because you get to learn a lot about the game and its mechanics, so when you do plunge in for the real end-game content (tbh that's where the game begins), you are pretty much prepared as a player.

2. Now balance is a tricky thing to discuss. It depends on what format of the game you are playing. PvP, Raids, WvW and Fractals have their meta builds and compositions that are favored over any random build you will play. PvE (the majority of the game) can be played with ANY build you like and come off successful, it all depends on you as a player. End-game content is all about skill progression and not gear progression.
---
3. The solo experience is genuinely as fun as a group experience. There is so much to do in this game as a solo player like jumping puzzles, personal story, map completion, leveling up, crafting and fashion wars..I have certain friends who prefer doing the whole thing solo.

If you need someone to give you a little tour in-game, PM me. I can take around spots and show how your way around things :D

GW1 wiki
---
&gt; a demon sent by Abaddon had disguised itself as a Fortune Teller and consulted Shiro... This caused him to turn to forbidden magic..."
---
Well shit I had no idea the fortune teller was a demon. When was that ever mentioned or is it like a wiki only thing?
---
Was that the deleted puzzle with the spinning faces? If so just continue playing.the.new.story and you should be ok.
---
If it is the puzzle without a chest in the end that you could reach by jumping from a tree in maguuma then the devs shut that one down with the open world gliding update.
---
I know thatnit is one of those but it has been too long
---
It is this exact attitude that led them to the layoffs as far as we know.  Their earning is directly tied to the living story releases / expansion.  “They are ready when they are ready” is such a terrible production philosophy for any company trying to generate more income/keep their customers happy.  Like you said, 2-3 months releases was a goal, they obviously fail to meet most of their goals (you know what happens in companies that consistently fail to meet their goals?).  It funny you mentioned kourna, because long live the lich was delayed for weeks.  And we still got a terrible release despite the delay.  Delay =/= more consistent/quality content.  It just shows how badly things were managed internally.  
---
But of course, we are not allowed to expect anything or criticize them because it is a “free game” and they are humans.  /s in case it is needed. 
---
Yep, thats cerebro. iirc there's still a spot where you can get in but i don't know where it is.
---
Can I never get rid of you ?!? XD 
---
Reddit still created a thumbnail, so don't worry about it.
---
This was explained towards the end of Nightfall showing that Abaddon pulled the strings behind issues in all 3 campaigns (The Searing, Jade Wind, and Nightfall).
---
See I remembered the fight with the lich and shiro while trying to contact the gods and for some reason I just never put 2 and 2 together. Oh well still loving the story even if we don't get Cantha.
---
So, aoe, mobile, slower than wvw mount, damages walls, and can shove the zerg apart.
---
Good news for you, [we already have that](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siege_Golem#Omega_Siege_Golem) and it has way more health than a mount, too.
---
no, i've got no life so i'm always here
---
Hi I am pretty new to the game but I have joined this guild recently, very friendly and we have a very active discord community, we hang out in voice chat all the time. Although I am new I never felt left out here and as almost as if we are long time friends and everyone is very welcoming so if you're interested then you're more than welcome cos they are recruiting currently plus I am doing pve currently, unlocking stuff etc and i play all the time. Ign- CruddyDrummer.9328
---
Pretty much what every commander I've been playing under has sounded like on coms.   
---
Apparently, for every 1 command you give, make sure to repeat it another 2-4-6 times just for good measure. 
---
Someone suggested some in the WvW discord recently: SBI (KS), FC (WE,BB), JQ (eA, DENT), FA (Pls), SoS (ZEAL), DB (zergs)
---
Ok
---
Yeah nothings gonna happen, just move one, maybe if you'll make enough drama the guy will get a slap on the wrist in the form of a temp ban but don't expect much else to happen :/ 
---
You are entitled to criticize and it is not a free game. It is still buy to play with a free account that is more like a trail instead of the full experience.
---
The earnings are not tied to any living story because they only get money from them when they release the next episode. The expansions are also only really that big when it releases. The most money they make is through gemstore purchases.
---
But that doesn't have anything to do with it. The layoffs were most likely NCSoft stepping in because ArenaNet was not focused on GW2 and instead did other things. ArenaNet earned 70 million Dollar in 2018 which is a lot of money.
---
I don't really understand how some can't be patient and not understand that delays can happen for various reasons. Layoffs, Datacenter issues, bugs, not being able to work at all are some of those factors. I mean if you look at the gaming scene and how the community in general behaves with "oh but I want it now, why can't you release it already" but then when they are bugs and glitches and other things in the game everyone is running wild, grabbing their pitchforks and screaming for boycotts.
---
So, "They are ready when they are ready" is a good thing if you don't expect to get paid for it which ArenaNet isn't through a new episode since anyone doesn't pay a single gem for them.
---
And from my point of view they had what, 2 delays, maybe 3 when Episode 6 will be delayed as well, now out of 12 episodes. That is not that much and saying that they "obviously fail to meet most of their goals" is just plain wrong.
---
Because at this point it's satire
---
My List of my Supports: 
---
Guardian Firebrand - Herrier or Cleric if you are not able to survive. You will be able to give them might , quickness, aegis.  By giving them aegis you give them quickeness as well and heal them with it. Your F2 does have really big range as well as your staff healing. 
---
Elemntalist Tempest(Auromancer) - Seraph or Pleaguedocrot if you are not able to survive. Build based on giving your friends auras and healing them by this way. No need to be aiming your healing skills at all. Relaxing way how to heal but chaotic way to use your skills. Sometimes I have feeling like Im pressing butons and hoping that something will happen. 
---
Ranger Druid - Herrier or Magis if you are not able to survive. Lately useless and now everyone here will hate me that I said it. Glyphs doesnt have much range so they would need to be standing right next to you. Spirits were also change now and are a bit less useless then before . So druid is slowely falling down in the healer ladder but still at the tom of the suppor buffer ladder. 
---
There is also Revenant healer somewhere around the auromancer but I didnt tryed that one myself yet. 
---
Yeah I'm pretty much new, started the game 2 weeks ago and just got PoF today. I think I have problems with every type of mesmer to be honest I just can't do anything to them when I play herald. I'm considering class changing to Mesmer just so I can understand what the hell theyre doing to me 
---
Everyone does have rights to play this game and enjoy it. If someone have problems with it then block them and move on. They can rage as much as they want to because it doesnt mater anymore ;) 
---
Yeah I think the only way for me to understand what Mesmer does is if I actually play Mesmer myself haha, so I'm probably gonna switch class to Mesmer, do you happen to have a sPvP build for conquest? and also some quick mesmer tips?
---
You can try to send all evidence to exploits@arena.net and hope for the best. They do swing the hammer but when they swing it's not perma but still enough to make that account crippled for a long time. In the past they stripped the titles and banned them from pvp for awhile. [source](https://mmos.com/news/guild-wars-2-july-tournament-cheaters)  [source](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/32066/recent-pvp-match-manipulation) 
---
Of course they have shitty pugs. They have 5 rangers in squad. 
---
just wish you would have more reasons to go there. Once you were there for the Ap and Aurora then you dont need to go there ever again. And if for loot then you can just leave one of your characters up there to open the chest daily =( 
---
It‘s great already ! Also I still hope Anet is gonna get inspired by your designs one day bc your charr, norn and canthan armor looks so good and I wish we had it ingame every time I see it !
---
I’ve got the feeling the pint of the video is to show this.
---
It basically takes where it hit, removes the current projectile and makes a new one as if you shot it from that point. The target for the projectile is the one that fired it but just like if you shot a projectile it can still be blocked by terrain or other players/mobs. Projectile physics in GW2 having built in homing so assuming the projectile doesn't get blocked or the target doesn't go out of range it should hit.
---
My static uses this in raids to get a mid-fight life force boost on encounters that otherwise have a low add count
---
I would have to disagree and argue that their earnings are deeply tied to living story releases / expansions! Yes, the living story episodes themselves are free, but they generate a lot of hype and bring a lot of players back.  When a lot of players come back, are generally happy with the content, and want some shinies, they spend gems.  Do you truly believe a company would spend resources on major projects like the living stories if they do not bring them any income?  Why bother if gem store is all they need? Scratch all living stories and focus 100% on the gem store then.  Why don’t they do that?  Because they will not making 70 million dollars last year that way.  Living stories/expansions bring them money, period.  
---
The layoffs wouldn’t have happened if gw2 was managed correctly.  You are right about the side projects.  But imagine all devs focused on gw2 and not the side projects.  I bet the release schedule will on time and the contents will be of better quality.  What do you think happen when living stories are released more often and of better quality?  I am inclined to believe the player base will be happier and player retention will be better.  What happens when you have a bunch of happy customers?  They spend gems and you make more money! 
---
I don’t deny 70 million dollars are a lot of money.  I bet they would have made more if the releases were better (time wise and quality wise).  I don’t know what metric ncsoft judged anet at.  But if they were happy with anet’s income, direction, and management, the lay off would not have happened.  
---
The layoffs, living stories release schedules, and the delays, they are all connected.
---
If you still disagree, I say let’s agree to disagree.  
---
Revenant is the slowest class. Revenant has no leaps, dashes, or teleports that work without a target. Guardian has the greatsword leap and dragonhunter F2 leap, so it would be slightly faster than a revenant.
---
I'd advice to use TacO, this way you have everything on your screen at once (note : may be too much information for some people taste)
---
I disagree here regarding guards mobility. If there is a mob as target, guard can teleport long distances with utility and weapon (Sword 2). Also you can chain F2 skill with GS 2 leap for immediate forward jumps and reset F2 with Elite if you have to.
---
During races in the open I found guard can be just as fast as mesmer. Although maybe that changes at short distances. 
---
So, the WvW warclaw boost bonus will really last until October 5 as stated on the website post? 
---
"Weeklong Bonus: World vs. World
---
Date and Time: From 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on September 28 to 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on October 5."
---
I mean, when I read "Weeklong" I thought it would last 1 week but then I saw the October 5 and Im confused now, doest anyone know for sure?
---
Thank you!
---
If you like sPvp i recommend you play warrior as a beginner to learn to defend yourself in 1v1 scenarios. Theres a Tetherbreaker build on metabattle.com if you look at conquest build's. Its a good class to learn 1v1 situations. Read the guise to understand the strength and weaknesses.
---
The silver-fed salvage-o-matic was on sale the 4th of March and bank tabs were in sale the 9th.
---
I think you have some misunderstanding of what I wrote.
---
&gt; Do you truly believe a company would spend resources on major projects like the living stories if they do not bring them any income?
---
directly? No, at least not on release of that specific episode. Any player who plays at that time will get it without having to pay for it. Even Free Accounts. Later, when they release the next episode THEN and only then they will get some revenue from that specific episode because players who missed unlocking it have to buy it. Of course, an expansion does play a part in this but it is still the same concept, play while the episode is active and don't have to pay for it and if you missed it you have to pay for it.
---
And it is not about "gem store is all you need" because of course you need to give your players something to do. That weapon or mount skin that fits with a new Living world episode will probably sell better than without one. So IMO it is that the living world draws players in but the "shinies" in the store make them spend their money, at least for active players.
---
Though this wasn't my point, and as you said, probably won't work.
---
&gt; But imagine all devs focused on gw2 and not the side projects. I bet the release schedule will on time and the contents will be of better quality.
---
Well, having only one iron in the fire is a bad thing for a company to do. You need to branch out and have other options. Unfortunately, ArenaNet managed that incorrectly, but I don't think that the game suffered under it. Would have it done better? Of course it would but it didn't got worse.
---
Throwing devs and money on something doesn't mean it will be better in the same time. Especially with bugs or something you can't really predict how hard it is to fix. Will it be on time? Maybe but it could also not happen at all because with more devs you also need to give them something to do. Which means, The more devs you have on a project the bigger your scope can and will be and that also means that you can still have delays or bugs in the end project.
---
This means, with a renewed focus on GW2 and more devs working on it you could see more stuff in a release but quality and release schedule will probably be the same.
---
&gt; The layoffs, living stories release schedules, and the delays, they are all connected.
---
Of course they are all connected because it is a company and in the end people managing that. But saying that "it is ready when it is ready" led to the layoffs is just wrong. Of course they could do better and it probably will in the future (probably not with the current or next few episodes). And it also doesn't mean that throwing people at something will make it bigger and better directly.
---
Lol the ingame recap is about as insightful as being told "shit happened" 
---
Idk about lefrere being a degenerate but you calling him trash player when you can't even cancel animation from elixir gun 4 is ummm... Well sad. What is also sad that sind, wing, cookie and torben carried this wintrader to win ToL :(
---
What about ***HAMMER?*** A big slow AA chain the way Guardian hammer works, but instead of dropping a Symbol, a skeleton pops out of the ground
---
F2P:  I highly suggest doing F2P before investing in this game.  It is 6 years old already and with the company layoffs and restructuring we aren't sure the clear direction this game will be going in.  I think the Core game is the best experience which you can do as a F2P.
---
Balance:  The game isn't balanced and there are clear cut META builds.  WvW and PvP aren't heavily invested in by the developer with the least amount of work done to them compared to the PvE side of the game.  If you want to play because you want to be competitive, I'd look elsewhere.   For PvE, while not balanced, it doesn't matter.  You can play anyway you want; however, a lot of folks play pure glass cannon DPS because content is repetitive you want to finish it quickly.  Raids do require you to use specific META builds.  Also, while there are balance patches once in a while, they aren't well done.
---
Solo Play:  Super friendly solo play.  I'd say this is a great MMO for a solo player.  I understand not having a lot of free time and this game is also perfect for that too.
---
&gt; Mesmers (especially with Shields
---
Hm, that's odd because the Chrono shield is "long channeled block move" and "AoE support move" which is exactly the sort of move they've been putting on shields the whole game. 
---
good to hear you found a family, in my case im looking for a family of 2-3members and am not fit to lead a guild like you did! and thank you but nah, im not looking for someone to help me out, i've got map chat, reddit and some people i met to help me.
---
Yeah, the toxic WvW thing is bad enough as a squaddie, can only imagne how much worse it is as a tag. Honestly, end of the day I figure if you wanna whine and say what they're doing wrong, then tag up and lead yourself to back it up - otherwise stfu and stop acting like a 12yr old .
---
When I run into what seems like a bad commander, I just drop and find another squad or another map. There's no need to say anything, they'll either learn eventually or move on to something else; and criticism is better taken from a guildie or a friend.
---
You did the little puzzle with the buttons after the spiritwood run? Only then you get the li
---
Boonbeast roamer in wvw here. Strongest roaming build around atm. Not one other build stands a chance. It got nerfed for pvp but still works good there too. In pve you'll always be meta as soulbeast dps or druid with spirits, spotter, glyph of empowerment, might stacks etc. 
---
Keep going mate. You didn't sound unsuccessful, also you didn't block an occupied map.  
---
Bet there were a lot of people having fun and enjoy your leadership and still having a gain.  
---
Most people complaining about the com are the ones who never would dare to make a run by themselves! They have high expectations but doing the job on your own is on a complete different level. Also if you are not good enough for them, they can always leave and find another com to follow\~  
---
Don't let your mood be ruined. Strangers like me who can join a random com which is semi successful is happy enough to join and brawl or flip over some towers. :)
---
Yes I did. I do my clears every Monday afternoon.
---
Remember when MO was in charge and we would get the episode in like 2 months. Those were the days. 
---
thats some really good commanding, great video too
---
Meanwhile you get 1 week ban for saying "cyka blyat rush b".
---
Anet are full of degenerates. 
---
Nothing's gonna happen, PvP doesn't exist for Anet :')
---
yea im a simplist, taco's nice but i dont need it.
---
anyone out there whos new or learning, yes its a big help cant stress that enough.
---
Even if you have transmuted an item you can still see which base item it still is. Transmutation is just applying a skin (with a transmutation charge), the object will still behave like the base object.
---
If you attempt to put your backpiece in the forge right now and hover on it you will get a warning saying (be careful even if its skin/name is B it will behave in the forge like the base item A).
---
I wouldn't bother with the majority of tags I've seen lately. They're clueless about wvw and following them is a rather futile experience from my pov.
---
But I see little point in sending them toxic whispers. And no matter what you do as a tag in wvw you'll have players QQ you didnt do what they want you to do. 
---
Fight too little or too much, ppt too little or too much, push too little or too much, talk too little or too much, Reeeeeeeeeeee why isn't this commander doing exactly what I want them to do. 
---
Not having a tag on a map can be a deliberate strategy tho.
---
You're probably looking at the wrong event (one that happened last year).
---
If you look at the initial [news on Anet website](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/tame-the-warclaw/) it's written 
---
&gt;To get you in the saddle quickly, you’ll earn double WXP when playing in WvW from February 26 to March 5.
---
Given that the update as pushed back by a week the bonus is from March 5 to March 12 (today).
---
I know exactly which spot you are talking about ;) took me quite a few attempts and in the End i think it was mostly luck. 
---
And Mounts are not allowed^^
---
who?
---
I recall a buddy of mine not getting theirs and the fix proposed by anet was: re-install and re-do the boss. 
---
I havent raided in a while, iirc the spirit woods event doesnt spawn a chest. Its not supposed to give LI? :)
---
Sounds more like Italians. 
---
The cool thing is that we already have the tech for that: WvW maps have a queue system.
---
Hey , mister Flandre or I caan say Miaz the true and only one ,w/e the names i can call u. So I just woke up from a birthday party from yday and see this , So , I am getting accused of wintrading , that's not really nice, especially when you still lying to the Community with spreading ur lies and fake dramas. So, you are basicly saying that 'Iriel' is me on an alt , that's a big problem cauz I've only 2 accounts :/ , another thingy I can say is that Iriel is a good war and I am trash at it , that's  a bit weird if I am him right? And I can say a bit more things about the Relationship about him and you sir MIaZ , if you can remember u throwing his games intentionally many times along ago and threatening to kill his 'family in real life' ,Don't try to denie it he has screenshots of it aswell :). And basicly a post coming out of the first and only one 'God of pvp' wintrader and talking about wintrade is hilarious . Thanks , I'll not waste my time anymore talking to a Shadow Lurker . 
---
6 years of playing as I want. I never cared what other things of me. Went against the meta and was hated , went with the meta and was hated . Reddit is definition of constant war because there will be always someone who will try to kick you down. Im more then use to it. The first day I started to play Gw2, my friend told me that I "must" be zerk elementalist (that was meta in those times). So I agreed and made myself cleric guardian just to **** him. 
---
Do you know what is the worst about meta ? That people will just copy it from websites, learn rotations and thats about it. They dont even know why they have this build at all. Only because it was written on a website. Meta builds were made my profesions who understand it for us. The DPS of these builds were tested probably with macros wich were pressing buttons in order and time wich we have problems to achieve. If I would have a macro and let it play, it would be better then 90% of meta players in the game. Even a monkey can be pressing buttons in specific order. But at the end thats how it works and its fine. What I personaly hate the most is that those 90% of player have some kind of cult. They blindly follow their god "META" and everytime someone will spoke against their god, they will strike him down. Having a meta build or trying it out doesnt mean that you guys should be fanatics about it =( 
---
It didn't used to but they updated this a while back because most people were simply skipping the event and now this drops an LI. 
---
https://dviw3bl0enbyw.cloudfront.net/uploads/forum_attachment/file/84000/eACzJ4e.gif
---
And then there are casual pve'ers that downvote anything thats not related to open world, jp, "cute pets" , art... They come in masses and shit in the face of progress and possible positive changes. Rarely I see a major problem hit the fan and that indeed moves Anet. 
---
It's still triple blink, it's no longer quad blink.
---
You can still get into it, theres a waterfall you can climb up with a hole that drops you through the map and then you can swimp over to the jp. Need a springer tho
---
I would not go as far as "dead" but 110% maintenance mode with included gemstore releases and living story. Both driven solely by profit. Non responsive game. 
---
Ah thanks, didnt know :)
---
Ban this shit
---
Is there a big difference ^^? 
---
That sounds like a really fun time in PvP.
---
Well one tend to have 6 reverse gears and 1 forward, the other hop from left to right. 
---
Guard gs3 is the same distance at less than half the cooldown, and no need for shenanigans to cast it properly.
---
Scrapper in WvW (after last update) 'is like a box of chocolates'... and such. You never know what you're gonna get.
---
Can we stop with this myth bullshit please ? Threads like this one about pvp or wvw abuse, or more generally about pvp/wvw stuff come to the front page pretty often, and certainly not less than pve stuff compared to their respective size. Did you or other pvp-only people get threads downvoted to oblivion in /new ? News : it happens to everyone and everything, including pve. Make a better thread, reach front page, and don't scapegoat "pve masses".
---
Hmm macro for doing their rotations as perfect as possible so they would know the max demage they could do. Set up - Let it run on Golem and you will see. Also I dont mind meta uilds just hate how people an be toxic when someone doesnt have a meta build . They literally want to tare you apart.

Maintenance mode, not dead Kappa
---
Wait are you thinking I mean all open world zones? Because that would be dumb.  
---
We're discussing the use in WvW and only WvW because the mobility is a much bigger factor. Unlike in open world where there is a waypoint everywhere. In WvW wp's aren't much of an option and without a mount you won't be able to keep up with  zerg's.  
---
If you mean having the mount available in 4 WvW takes away all incentive  from buying PoF then you aren't grasping how 1 gold per hour adds up. And you aren't even bothering to imagine simple changes like only letting the first mastery get unlocked by rental. It takes away from functionality but in a balanced manner that provides incentive and fairness. 
---
I always loved the Asian armour detailed work, they represent many figures, gods and mystical creatures, is awesome your line art does it pretty good :)
---
Too bad that medieval games nowdays tend to add: 
---
- neon colours and light mythical sparkles and huge spikes coming everywhere, making you look like a fashion space porcupine somehow.
---
Congratulations :) I enjoyed your "draw sketch( I know is not finished) " and I hope to see your work completed :) ! 
---
I also hope to see games focus in something more like this and less like medieval robotic... future wherever ppl want to call it .
---
:)
---
What they should do it make a post of the forums saying it won’t be released on the original cadence (for obvious reasons whatever we get it), and then give an extra month delay on top of it. Give themselves plenty of wiggle room cuz you know it’ll be later than they say. If they think it will take an extra week to polish, tell us an extra month. That way we’re not all hyped on a trailer/patch day only to get disappointed later. 
---
By macros I do as stated refer to having for example MB6 as E, not making macros in the sense that pressing one button starts a chain/does more than one action i.e. Blink+Shatter. 
---
Okay but these days open world dailies take 5-10 minutes for the most part, particularly if you add in easy WvW dailies into that mix. I could play 15 minutes a day, have 14 gold a week, which would easily be enough to fund mount rentals. 
---
I'm sorry but this is one of the most generous free to play type games on the market.  You can't play WoW free to play and get to max level, or you couldn't the last time I played. 
---
You want to do anything besides story in Star Wars 2 you pretty much HAVE to buy the optional subscription.
---
This whole you have access to everything once you buy the expansions which often go on sale for under $20?  Generous as hell.
---
I see zero need for it to be more generous. If you want to play the game, support the game. That's my take on it.
---
but if its a one time deal then theyll only get one report which will likely be ignored as an anomaly; if its consistent behaviour and people arent reporting it because they think its a one time deal then its a problem
---
Sind only sees the game as easy buck from subs anyway, he has shown that he doesn't actually care about the game a year ago after selling the monthly automated tournament.
---
It can be (WoW did have a competitive scene once, although it was replaced by MoBAs and FPS as the esports started gaining more tract) 
---
GW2 has the basis for good combat, it just came at a bad time and had poor spectator settings (what made Overwatch Season 1 unwatchable, they had to get on it asap). Of course it was a bad time since this was during the bunker meta, so games were extremely boring to watch (chronobunkers and scrappers for days, matches could literally have 1-2 kills, or NO kills all game). It also didnt help that they have glacial patch cadence (3-5 months between patches), something they have yet to improve on, which allows builds like mirage/soulbeast/Sw.D thief/spellbreaker/scrapper/holo to fester the servers, and classes like ele being completely deleted for 3 years without any hope on sight. 
---
GW2 has active combat and they have been removing many passive defense traits and skills, but mesmer clutter, whether balanced or not in numbers, makes for very messy to watch matches, much of the damage and heals dont have many unqiue effects like particles or traveling, so as an spectator you just see people's health dropping and raising without a clue of what happened.
---
Playing off meta just to be unique, but ending up as being one of the most generic players you can see, the irony.
---
you can, it won't be good though lol.
---
Like really there is a serious lack of attention in PvP and i believe a mount in PvP can add a new aspect and bring new players into the game 
---
Dagger mainhand is used quite often for boonstrip and CC but dagger attacks only hit 2 targets so thats quite a lack of damage and just an utility weapon.
---
Offhand isn't as usefull since it only brings a backstab and the fan, I guess you'd rather use Axe or Mace.
---
Yeah they need some real updating. Oh someone else already used a merchant now I can’t or have to travel very far away first. Oh I summoned my TP now I need a merch gotta wait for him to die. At least bank doesn’t someone anyone 
---
When I started HoT I played [this build]. It's far from optimal but it made me survive a lot more. Vigor, fury, 40% protection, swiftness and regeneration from auras. Long duration might from blasting fields and fire overload. I used glyph of storm often in earth for the constant aoe blind.
---
Op dodnt even tell us if its for WvW or PvE
---
Well, when I help newbies when I see them struggling or having questions and they ask what they can do to pay me back, I simply tell them to play and if they see someone else struggle, to simply help them too.
---
You know what to do know :)
---
Honestly no class is actually hard, as long as you know the basics youll be fine in 99.9% of cntent
---
play whatever you enjoy for map completion etc.
---
the 'problem' only starts arising when you go for HIGH end fractals and raids. groups that will run those will require a certain level of competence at the class you're playing, and ele has to work pretty hard to reach their peak.
---
This is exactly how most mmos detect bots btw :) 
---
So yes, playing using macros can get you flagged, tried it on a F2P acc to see if I could get atleast plat on a F2P condi core mesmer with entire burst rotation macroed and it got the account suspended :’) 
---
Could ofc just be ppl reporting cuz I wasn’t exactly hiding it when in pregame lobby I’d tell ppl they were gonna die to something which was pretty much a brainafk toddler pressing one key. Also proved my point that condi was way overtuned (back when ineptitude was aoe blind/confusion on interupts)
---
If you have a guild that only very few people have access to you could always exchange it via the Guild Bank: they deposit all the leather inside and then you pick it up. And there is very little chance that this gift will be seen as Real Money Trading (RMT): even if Anet has had some issues with the way they deal with RMT (sometimes involuntary) receivers they were still pretty correct that the gold was coming from RMT so no issue in this case imo.
---
but why?
---
Is this the game equivalant of couples having a shitty life and they think having a baby will fix this?
---
I dont want to be unique. Just didnt wanted to be a mindless zombie following others. The thing what is pissing me off is that my guardian is not a meta build. Quickness Firebrand =( 
---
I treyed to be diferent and ended up in the meta anyway =( 
---
The female charr faces are practically the only ones with real cat counterparts. I had made a list last year compiling all the faces to cats haha
---
I've mained ele for years and yeah it's glassy if you run zerk gear and try to tank things! I have an open world gear set I use which is celestial gear stats. Ele can be pretty sustainy if you just gear and trait it right and make use of your attunements  appropriately. A quick and easy set to grab is Soldiers (Pwr, tough, vitality) exotic gear from the TP. It will give you room to learn the class inside and out, then more to a more offensive stat combo! Additionally, take some utility skills like arcane shield, lighting flash (Tele away from foes), must form etc etc. And if you're weaver, twist of fate is great.
---
As for fracs, you will likely have a dedicated healer there so go for a more glassy build. Plus you will have an understanding of your more sustainy utility skills and what is appropriate to take by that point! 
---
Hope this helped 
---
This is beyond awesomeness. I really love the color scheme, and the characters. Especially that badass charr hanging this greatsword and staring at us like he's gonna end us in one move. Good job! Keep posting this kind of art, I love it 💓
---
It just simply depends on the nature of the reporting person ;) 
---
&gt;I dont want to be unique.
---
&gt;I treyed to be diferent and ended up in the meta anyway =( 
---
I expect people to have meta builds in time based encounters. Raids are time based. Every boss does have time limit and you need to kill him before that time will run out. The same can be said in Fotm in some situations. Observatory at the first tight where you need to jump fron one island to another and kill 4 veterans quickly before the platform will explode and kill ou all. Or at 99 CM Nightmare where you have to again kill 4 veterans ? Elites ? In specific time. I expect people to yell at me there when I dont do enough demage or sleeping. But In WvW ? That would be to much even for me.. 
---
Nametags disabled. DROPPED
---
Suggestion for HoT:  swap out Flash Freeze for Aftershock.  Lots of mobs in Maguuma have projectile spam (frogs and snipers), particularly), and you get a second reflect bubble that isn't tied to rotation (so you can keep it up while Earth is in cooldown)
---
One tip i can give is to take Glyph of Storms. It may not be a shield, but if you swap to earth you can apply constant blind through it for its duration.. which is usually more than enough to secure a kill. I always found more comfort in playing Tempest, mostly because Overloads are so useful in open world, and you have a lot more buffs for yourself. I generally run with Staff just for the kiting. I've never needed defensive traits or utility skills, but I also know everyones playstyle is different and that ele can be severely rough if you have slower reaction times. Also yes, I run full berserker stats too. would love to offer more advice, so if you have anything in particular to ask please do. 
---
I'd actually report them for verbal abuse if they're being verbally abusive. That's what it's for. 
---
I’m not a fan of the guy but I have my doubts **in this instance**.
---
The only we proof we have that LeFrere is on the Ariel account is because Flandre says so in team.
---
Now Flandre is an interesting one, because it has long since been suspected/known that Flandre is Miaz.
---
Miaz in the past has made posts exactly like this, for instance he was the one that made a Reddit post complaining about Sindrener being an ArenaNet Partner. It’s worth noting that the account he wintraded to God of PvP (yes he’s no different) is perma banned. He has made a lot of twitch accounts in the past to troll chats (mine included), trying to catfish, bait reactions, etc. Not a pleasant guy at all.
---
Now honestly what ArenaNet needs to do, is look into that account, see if it’s been shared around a lot, which I suspect it has, and from there start handing out permanent dishonour. Gate them from this community and completely devalue their achievements. 
---
Don't worry about it mate. My friend and I co-command a small flip squad all the time on a tier 1 server (he has a tag, I'm better at navigating and talking to people). We do it whenever the other tags are getting bogged down in long fights or other things we don't care to participate in. During long queues we'll even command EotM for fun.  
---
Sometimes people will get annoyed, but they usually understand if we point out that they should join the other tag on the map. But sometimes people really appreciate a smaller group. We've even been sent superior siege blueprints by people who appreciate our efforts. Signing off to a chorus of thanks, or asking if we run a discord, or asking if they can join us another time makes up for the people who question our methods.   
---
The only additional suggestion I'd have is don't be too scared. THAT is a way to lose followers. If you have enough supply and see an uncontested keep, don't be too scared to take it. See an approaching Zerg that looks about the same size as you? You don't have to be first to engage, but be ready to fight them instead of instantly running.   
---
Keep at it mate. You don't have to be a perfect tag. Just be clear about what you're doing. 
---
&gt; unless you are in the top 100 you wont be seeing things like this often or at all.
---
Why even bother getting good at the mode and trying to get to top 100 if you already know it's going to be rigged? There's no incentive for players to actually rank up, Anet clearly doesn't care.
---
It was in GW1
---
Saying a meta build wont help because the enemy outnumbers you is like saying a meta build for pvp wont help cause you can get afks and trolls. And also, a good and organized zerg can kill a bigger one if it lacks organization or good builds. 
---
People who go off on their own (roaming) are not running cleric guardian, shortbow condi thief, tank elementalist, whatever .. they used to run high mobility high single damage classes (not so much anymore, mounts cutt off the need for dedicated mobility). Either way, they were running the most optimal builds for the task at hand. Obv the meta builds for wvw on the websites are builds for zerging, one must do their own or use other resources when the goal is roaming, a totally different use case. You don't run the same meta comp in fractals / raids for instance, despite both being instanced pve content. 
---
Drugs are bad mkay. 
---
Lots of clueless tags running around since the mount came out. Either suck it up or let somebody else tag up.
---
I dunno if I agree, he seems overrated from the run ins I have had fighting him. He even brain afk attacked my AED heal with auto attacks in rampage.
---
I'm not that surprised though. ANET doesn't take their own PvP game mode seriously. The amount of neglect they have shown it and WvW is astonishing, when they are the 2 most powerful potential sellers for the game in my opinion.
---
Now that's just bullshit. I am part of the problem because I refuse to play in a system that does not have its rules properly enforced?!
---
Up until now I did not belive a person (besides SJW's) could make so many asumptions.
---
If you cant cope with other people and different experiences they had in their lives then maybe it's time to fulfill your nickname. 
---
Yeah, whenever I think of this game's potential which they turned their back on, I honestly get triggered.
---
I cannot believe, the people with the talent to create one of the best if not the best combat experience/engine in not only MMOs but many multiplayer titles shot themselves so hard in the foot by focusing purely on 'Taimi's Next Chapter of Deus Ex Machina' instead.
---
Why not just have the autoupdater prompt the user for the GW2 directory?
---
I got lost somewhere between "oh sweet a dev responded to my comment" and "oh boy am I in trouble, why would I be in trouble?" but I didn't lose any sleep over it :)
---
Good balance increases the competitive aspects and population of the game which does help combat win trading. Being able to win trade is a consequence of a huge amount of players especially at the top end not caring about the game state.
---
Also made vastly easier by a tiny competitive population. 
---
When are the hordes of anti pvpers going to be outraged by the balance state since hot/pof?
---
_worth_ it for all my WvW characters, less loading screens, can see which maps are more likely to need my help (instead of just looking for shortest queue)
---
Can get crafting done while keeping an eye on the maps.
---
I got a chuckle from reading this. I remember when dota happened once to me. 
---
Some want to learn. Some want to get better. But having others just rage at you and yell at you for your wrong build insted of helping you ? Thats not foolish. 
---
People who take this game's PvP this seriously, and think rank matters...even a little bit...makes my day that much more enjoyable.
---
It was not, is not, and never will be E-sports. If they thought that they are so good, they'd spend time playing an actual E-sports game.
---
While GW2's PvP and combat is highly enjoyable (especially compared to other MMORPGs), it is NOT E-sports quality, and never will be.
---
No the community is part of the problem by heavily being against pvp.
---
And yet this post will get higher than any post speaking about other issues pvp has and how those should  be improved because most of the community is against pvp and this fits their circle jerk.
---
And unless you are top end pvper, you're not impacted by the rules not being enforced at all. 
---
I don't remember death threats there though. 
---
I wanted to post a copy of my post above because I would like to hear your opinion on the matter:
---
This isn't entirely true.
---
There are 2 kinds of PvP threads mainly:
---
Positive ones which include community run tournaments, advice threads/videos or guides, possibly montages but not that often on this subreddit imo. These from my experience only tend to get like 20-30 upvotes MAX, and that is generous.
---
Negative ones with wintrading call outs like this one, accusations, complaints about PvP or other types of PvP drama which generally reflect poorly on the game mode. These tend to get A LOT of attention and upvotes. Like this one is in the hundreds already but a huge wintrading one was like thousands before.
---
The prime issue here is, the complete misconception that this spreads to people even vaguely interested in playing PvP that it is some toxic game mode where people constantly flame/wintrade and argue. Which is very rarely the case. Sure, flaming can happen more often than wintrading/arguing of course, but it isn't as common as you think, at least not in my experience and I have played 5000+ PvP games.
---
I think what RenaDrayen is trying to address is the unfair representation of PvP on this subreddit, and the frustration with those of us that have developed a love for the game mode when positive things like community run tournaments or events (despite the huge amounts of effort) are less upvoted than 'cute pets' or artsy screenshots or low effort memes, is on display here.
---
It isn't about "making a better thread", it is about catering to what this subreddit seems to upvote as a hivemind. I guarantee if we were to observe the frontpage for the period of a month, we would see more cutesy posts of artsy fluff than ANY other thing, sprinkled with some PvE opinions/discussions and the occasional PvP/WvW anger/drama post/complaint (including wintrading).
---
As I said above, 'quality posts' aren't as consistent for upvotes, as much as catering to popular opinion is. Heck, go and post a screenshot of your "First legendary after 6 years" and I am almost willing top put money on it that it will get more than the 20-30 upvote post of a recent community tournament with loads of effort to run/organise it did.
---
Got a build you like that isn't staff? I'm a staff Weaver in WvW and so I did map comp with one of those but I'm thinking about trying a different build. Thing is the transition from mob murder to single targets really has me annoyed and I've been trying to find middle ground. 
---
The weird thing is that my blocklist has more people from my own server than from others... there's at least as many opinions on what good commanding is as there are players. Don't let it discourage you!
---
Finding a guild will help you start a squad... a team of five can carry the momentum for quite a bunch of people. If you're on Vabbi, drop me a PM :)
---
Lol, this are exact the same characters I use. Dragonhunter for story line and events/bosses. Soulbeast for end-game pve (fracs/raids). Scourge for pvp/wvw. It's fun to have the possibility to just chose in what mood you are in to. Although, I love my DH the most. 
---
&gt; only Thunderhead Peaks offers the Diviner Stats)
---
no, diviner stats are in ls3 map trinkets as well
---
Youre missing "My whole Weekend and social Connections for the next month" 
---
Never.
---
We all know ANet won't do jack.
---
They're assholes in every game. Don't even bother replying, just set them as ignored and continue having a good time. If folks are following your tag and you're all having fun, that's all that matters. It's a video game.
---
Rev could excel depending on the distance to travel, and if you have Herald equip: On the boon level, Rev have the highest Swiftness boost at my knowledge (at least last time I checked Professions Skills) at 33% speed boost. If combined (alternatively) with Impossible Odds (Assassin Stance) and Staff 5 it could actually not be that bad.
---
For stronghold only!
---
You can fight significantly outnumbered if you have builds that are considered meta.  If you don't have, say, minstrel Firebrands, then you will get farmed, and you will notice the lack of support. 
---
Check fresh air tempest builds on metabattle/yt.
---
240 gems for a name change contract was a must have for me, so I got it.
---
I've wanted to change at least one of my character's names but at the original 800 gem price tag, I'm not that desperate!
---
70% off is nice. A shame the name change contracts aren't permanently cheaper. I reckon they should be around 400-500 gems as a standard price. 800 is just way too much IMO.
---
If you have common decency why would you chase a group that doesn't want you, and who have a play style you don't agree with? This is why I consider these pugs toxic and so many players get tired of them. 
---
Its players insisting to follow groups that aren't fit for them. Its not against the rules but it's a pretty douchy thing to do.
---
Doesn't matter if it's a closed guildraid, an elitist commander, a sneaky backcap group or a minion master only raid. 
---
If the group doesn't want you following them, find a more appropriate group. The idea that you can follow and stalk whoever you like isn't friendly at all. Its toxic / griefing yet the standard ever since the reward update. 
---
In plenty of wvw communities you were expected to be respectful of groups that didnt cater to you and allow them to do their own thing, too. Nowadays this is somehow only expected from comms, groups and guilds towards pugs with zero regard for the other party.
---
Respect goes both ways.
---
Swiftness is 33% for all classes. It doesn't stack with Superspeed. All classes have ways to get 100% swiftness uptime.
---
huh? LOL when did this turn to /me/ being the one with the dumb assumptions?
---
Scepter/Warhorn is great. It can run essentially the same traits/setup as Staff but adds a welcomed change to the combat without completely rewriting your thinking method. If you aren't opposed to Tempest that is. If you would rather not, then you can substitute a dagger or focus for offhand, depending on your preference 
---
Genial, simplemente genial
---
Haven’t played for about four years, and I’m currently downloading the game again to give it a whirl. Just wondering how, if at all, worth it the expansions are to get now instead of when I finish all the “vanilla” content. Does the expansions add anything crucial during the normal leveling process? For instance, I noticed a class was locked behind an expansion. 
---
Heng of denravi sadly.
---
Following a closed tag in WvW literally does no harm. The tag will ignore you. You wont steal the boons / heals so you're literally just another dude. You can run off and kill yourself in the zerg, stay behind and not tag the bodies, doesn't matter to the tag. So, at least in WvW, following a closed tag is not a big deal. Problem is when you flame that tag for not putting you in when you dont meet the requirements. 
---
I think in any competitive setting people can quickly become heated, and that aggression translates into their tone of voice. As suggested in the other posts here, I'd definitely just ignore them and move on! 
---
Focus on the positives here, there were a bunch of other people who silently appreciated your commanding them. Having an active commander, new or old, in WvW, is an asset to keeping the community going. 
---
If you can't find a WvW guild, I am sure there is a community WvW Discord out there. Most servers have them.
---
Someone has to tell those little lemmings (like me) what to do.
---
I'll follow you off a cliff, I'll do it for the glory of WvW!
---
I was just talking with someone about this last night. I was trying to do the Not So Secret JP for a collection, and after I fell a couple times, a mesmer landed right next to me and portaled me up (actually they had to do it twice since I died on the way to the chest). Tried to tip them and they returned it saying they liked hanging out there. Not the first time something like that happened to me. 
---
Some small groups do effectively run servers. If kill leaves WSR the server wont stay a main server just like FSP didnt. Once the comms and guilds left vabbi it went back to nothing too. Same happened to plenty of other servers. 
---
These comms and guilds might not own the server but they do effectively run it. And if they leave the vast majority of the server leaves too, within a few months of time. They control activity and ppt for a large part too. Turns out pugs don't stick around without them.
---
Wvw would be less toxic if anet gave full server control to the players, so they could make their own groups as servers with like minded people.
---
Is that CPU usage per core, or total CPU usage?
---
Absolutely stunning! I must admit that Rata Sum is my favorite racial city, not only is the architecture creative and cool, they also house a wide array of cute asuras :3
---
Rata Sum is *so close!*  Yet so far.
---
Almost all expansion content is at level 80, so you won't need it for normal leveling.
---
Some people boost a character to 80 with Path of Fire to get a mount to save travel time, but 1-80 is free-to-play. 
---
You can't play Revenant without Heart of Thorns, but that's about the only thing that'll make a difference. 
---
The only real difference is PvP, where all characters are scaled up to 80 to even things out. The expansions have extra skill sets that you won't have access to, but there are core builds that can more than hold their own. 
---
My advice: if you enjoy the game, wait for a sale and get them then. 
---
Rallybotting does harm. Watching guilds try to 20v20 but being unable to because they have 20 unorganised pugs jump in does harm and prevents them from doing what they want to do. Watching gvgs and scrims get interrupted because ??
---
It's ok to want to do a closed raid. Common decency states that if you can play what you want, you allow others to do the same. 
---
Man you sound like me.. I tried out Weaver and found it extremely underwhelming without alacrity and boon support, so i went and geared out my Mirage.. ran with it for a good long time because it was fun, new, and powerful. Now I'm back at staff Tempest just because its always going to be my actual main. 
---
It is in no way harder, you're right.. it's just very unforgiving towards any little mistakes you may make, and a lot of players don't have the reaction time to play it efficiently or would get too upset from going down during their learning phases. I know there are a good bit of alternative runes for it if the bonus is hard to upkeep with scholar, i just keep scholar slotted in because I raid with it and it's just easier overall. 
---
Also yeah, nearly all mobs can be handled once you understand their patterns, and with how strong Ele is.. I normally joke that going down is part of the rotation just for the lava font you produce. Ele is essentially the 'fuck this location in particular' class. The AoE is just so nice for open world. I've tried other weapons to kind of swap up the style and keep it fresh, but nothing really compares to staff when you want to play a bit more casually while still throwing tons of dps
---
Support does not normally like giving you "free" things...unless you have connections, then you can earn multiple things of things you should only have one of.
---
You can play Revenant as long as you have either expansion, not just HoT
---
Not sure what has led to this sudden uptick in Mordremoth memes but I'm here for it.
---
GW2 is not really that optimized to handle a lot of player models on the screen. Reduce the limit and quality and you will get more FPS.
---
I don't think there is an issue with your GPU it just has something to do. If it would constantly stay at 100% I would be concerned. 
---
Hey, Zommoros doesn't make fun of your kinks.
---
dealwithit.jpg
---
rev with executioners axe fastest by far
---
I wasn't asking for anything "free" I wanted the reward for the event I completed which I didn't get because apparently there's a bug. If they had at least acknowledged the existence of the bug I wouldn't mind not getting a single LI. What bothers me is that this can happen again and the way they replied to me.
---
So this would be the best time to gem to gold?
---
Rich wood nodes could have been mature trees.
---
Or elephant mount.  
---
Soul beast ranger with an owl as pet and sword.  100% swiftness uptime, 2 charges on low cd.  I always felt the most mobile with this.  
---
I started GW2 about 7 weeks ago and have played ele almost exclusively in open world PvE content since then.  I've completed levels 1-80, personal story, season 2, HoT, season 3, and PoF.
---
I would personally not recommended elementalist as your solo/open world character unless you enjoy the class immensely.  While they can do everything, I feel it just isn't worth the hassle.  You will die more often than probably any other class.  
---
Staff weaver, SW/d weaver, and sc/x tempest all kill mobs very quickly.  However, you are made of freaking paper, often dieing from 2 hits.  If you're caught outside of your 2 arcane shields, you will die extremely quickly.
---
Ele is loads of fun in fractals, WvW, PvP, meta events, etc.  But I feel like solo PvE should be a break from the more engaging content mentioned above.  And it requires too much attention to detail and stress for my liking.  You're always one tiny misstep from downstate.
---
If you're dead-set on ele there are a few things I'd recommend.  Use earth elemental on any moderately difficult fight.  He takes most of the hits and gives you plenty of time to burn stuff down.  Use arcane shield on your bar, as well as the passive proc in the arcane tree.  These 2 have saved me more downs than I can count.  Use glyph of storms.  In earth it is a great defensive utility applying several blinds to targets in an area.  In air it is a damage powerhouse.  And in fire it has a very low cooldown while still dishing out decent damage, great for clearing packs where air would be overkill.  
---
And finally I recommend staff weaver as it is probably the most consistent, relaxing solo gameplay.  It has heavy frontloaded damage through fire/earth OR fire/air dual skill, fire 2, and fire 1.  These 3 all land at the same time when casted in succession and are usually enough to kill a mob or 2 instantly.  Staff has heavy AoE through fire 5, fire 2, and fire/earth dual skill.  Staff can also do damage while kiting, something mainhand sword or dagger struggle with.
---
I believe sc/x tempest is more popular solo build.  It has a wider frontloaded AoE for clearing packs instantly, but the follow up attacks are relatively weak and personally the trade-off of being forced into basically melee range is not worth it.
---
 I'm not flandre and this post wasn't made about flandre. The entire pvp community should know that this lefrere person is shady. Iriel was also said to be lefrere by multiple people. It's a strange coincidence that the moment this entire situation happened, lefrere replied to it instantly. This image should be self explanatory. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554984725345861663/554991923736084490/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554984725345861663/554991923736084490/unknown.png) I don't know about the past or any of the claims you are making. What should be the focus is the investigation of lefrere and iriel accounts. The death threats should be enough to deserve a ban. 
---
god bless anyone who has to play whilst listening to this
---
I know there's a guild or two who includes DS in their meta trains. They also run AB like three times in the whole sequence. 
---
Come to mag best new player experience around rn
---
But if you are below that threshold you get to see people afk after losing first mid fight because they don’t care about losing if it means they can take people down with them with their manchild tantrums. 
---
I do agree that the team voice or separated queues that allow 5 man would reduce this crap, but I honestly think ANet is at the point with PvP that those tasks seem like more of a headache than worth the focus to them.
---
Multi class for wvw dog, your commanders will thank you for being flexible
---
I definitely wish this was a thing. I could see the nodes not resetting while you were in the map, but all it would require would be to switch maps and boom new nodes. 
---
Good shit ks
---
GPU usage should be high, 80-100% is normal.
---
You are what we need in WvW. Such a small minority has the bravery to tag up. Don't let any negative person get you down!
---
So you're going by "Commander" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Mordremoth from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Glint the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic.."
---
Then anyone else just needs [a rune set to easily pass the rev.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Speed) Or engis, mesmers and thieves don't even need it to stay ahead.
---
I have a guild bank I could let you guys use. My wife and I are the only real active members and neither of us can play right now.
---
I can log in just long enough to invite you to the guild and set up bank permissions for you.
---
I dunno.  I can't speak for other people but I can kinda speak for my guild since they keep coming back to play with me.  The energy of my raids aren't stressful, we're all really excited and people generally carry the same energy as I do.  The more excited I get the more the rest of my group gets into it and I absolutely never shout at my group in anger.  I can understand why some people wouldn't like that but for me and my crew we all get pretty into it.  You just can't really hear the rest of my group because I record my audio significantly louder than everyone else because I know not everyone wants their voices on youtube and stuff.  Additionally, I don't like downtime in comms because people drift off much faster than you'd think, and unless you've commanded its not something you'd generally notice.  That's why I think the repeat yourself shouting 6 times is so popular.  I can get why it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea though. 
---
A bit cheeky measuring the enemy zerg when the numbers looked pretty even.
---
Some commanders won't tag up if there is already a tag on a map. People might know that and resent you for not "letting" this other person tag up.  Less likely these days, but once upon a time....
---
Sometimes when there are multiple tags, the pugs are divided amongst these tags and less effective than if they were all together working toward a common goal.  This negatively impacts the player reward and the server success and commanders, especially new or returning commanders, should be cognizant of this and act accordingly. The Warclaw isn't going anywhere, you don't all have to be tagged up everytime you feel like it.
---
Sometimes people are just morons and need blocking.  
---
Sometimes people just like attention.
---
Drivers up to date. Game running on the GPU sure.

Currently i have all settings at the lowest. And i off nvidia inspector "minecraft graphics". I make few tests. And it's a bit strange.  
---
When all at the lowest. I have 15-17 fps in the center of pvp lobby.  When i change my textures, Environment to High.  Fps still 15-16. So the problem isn't in the videocard?   
---
ahh yes, let's give a zero-tell mobile stealth+smoke field to a class that has infinite blast finishers and a triple leap. 30+ seconds of stealth? sounds reasonable. /s

Does NCSoft prevent games from developing Chinese flavored zones/cultures?

She still have her Gmail account access, we're fairly sure it's under her old Gmail because she can't create a new account with the same email address. The only reason I even sent in the ticket is because I could of bought a serial and gave it to my wife (idk if buying the serial counts as "account ownership)

Well Yes, But Actually No.

The ticket probably was closed because it was flagged as duplicate to the original ticket.

Try submitting any information you can in that original ticket to get the account back. Many players have recovered their account with just the character name.

Thanks brother!

Well, it's not as big as an issue anyway if you'd missed it than to do chalice of tears for the achievement, then discover you need it again for the tokens...

...and then you unlock aurora collection... guess who's back

We provided email address, display name, character name, ans estimated account creation date. They weren't able to recover it.

I was only dead for roughly 24 seconds, buddy.

This game is marketed towards twelve year olds, so no matter what class you pick, you won't be doing rocket science with it.
---
That said, Elementalist has a lot more buttons to push than most other classes and dies pretty quick without the right buttons at the right time, because he has low health and cloth armour.
---
When you have it on lowest AND highest you both get ~15 FPS? then something is wrong.
---
Try to repair the game and check if the game is not running on the internal graphics chip that some motherboards/CPUs have.

No one uses macros dude. This game isn't hard enough to require macros for rotations. Almost all rotations for the various builds are super easy, and even the slightly more difficult ones are easily learned conceptually and then learned as a sequence of skills.

"Stealth is able to be stacked up to 5 times."

So at the end of the gyro its like 18ish seconds total.

then try to escalate this to a higher instance, supervisor etc.

Try to find any other way to identify that you actually bought it, bank statement or receipt or anything. look through your mail accounts if you bought gems or anything.

What's the latest WvW meta build for scourge after the balance changes? I would love to hear your thoughts given the big Harbinger Shroud change.
---
What is the connection between Dhuum and demons? I know he had demons in his army when he tried to take control of the Underworld back from Grenth, but was it an alliance that he made for this event, or did the demons followed him even before that? Did he command demons when Grenth first attacked and took over his godhood? I am asking for a tabletop campaign.
---
She should send as much relevant identifying information as she can for the account (including character names, gem purchase receipts, etc if she has them). If you have a serial key archived in your e-mail, she should include that as well. 
---
&gt;We did provide details on her ticket but they weren't able to recover the account. At this point I'm just about to give up on this game again and just never bother with it.
---
I get that you are frustrated, but you really can't blame them if you have lost all login information to the point you can't remember for certain which e-mail is attached to the account. They are not the steward of your account, that's your job.

Thanks, I prefer the more subtle look when designing armors. If something were to have all the particle effects and spikey look, it'd most likely be on a powerful boss or something.

thanks!

thank you

The Meta build for Soulbeast for raids and fractals is the Power Soulbeast build which can be found here:

You're running all Berserker gear (Power, Precision, Ferocity) with Runes of the Scholar. 
---
gracias
---
meanwhile this been the issue from the start of ladder, that why i stop playing after i realize a bunch of pver payed esl players to get the titles :( i can see its tsill the same nothing change.
---
By far the the most frustrating experience in gw2 to date. 
---
Don't really know what to say about this situation, he is not the first and he will not be the last.  Its kinda sad to see what people are willing to do for this title.    
---
In any case, I think you did the right thing there, and I am glad you stomped them in this game.  
---
Plus, your scrapper gameplay is cool! I should follow you on twitch!
---
Viva La Dirt League on YouTube made a great [video](https://youtu.be/YUvrLBv2zBc) on this.

Just block and ignore. If you're good, people will follow. If you're bad, people won't. Just do what you enjoy, especially if it's a mostly inactive map that could use a pin to help guide the puglings to objectives.

It can be 1 hour before/after daily reset then.

It ha sbeen asked b4, they should reset with daily reset.

PvP?
---
This price for same type of mount skin.  
---
And no way to buy the one I wan't.  
---
This is madness.
---
Wow, I thought the skins were gonna be sold separately. It's nice that they're not 2000 gems each, but I wish I could get just one for 400 gems instead. 
---
It's a hidden one that I think is called "Perfect Fit".  You need to stick your Warclaw in a box.  One in each racial city, one in LA, and 2 next to the two catmanders.  But that's bugged right now since the Catmanders are in a No Mount zone
---
All or Nothing.
---
This skin pack is so bad... Even for 800 gems.
---
I don't know why don't make well... Put each skin for 500gems or pack 2000 gems. With the price nobody gonna buy this skins
---
So, do you get them all, or is it a rng situation.
---
Where you randomly get one of them? 
---
The dude is using terms like "sjw" so it goes without saying their opinion means jack shit.
---
Anet has finally found a way to sell mount skins to wvw players?
---
4/5 have the same looking armor.

Which is a bit ugly.

Is this creativity?

Im a sucker. 2000 gems later..
---
Thx for your light, any other server consider as a good fighter which is not German language focus ?
---
A friend an I tackled aether jp with two mesmers. Taking turns at jumps and portaling back up. Huge pain in the ass, even if the area was cool. 
---
Thx for that help to clarify
---
Oh gosh that’s hella good!
---
These skins are some of the laziest ones we've seen as well. The recolours are incredibly boring compared to what they are doing with the core mount recolours and the model change looks demented.
---
Overall I think this is a disappointing mount pack, but it would have been more disappointing if they had bundled these same skins with another core mount pack (thus having a really low chance of rolling any warclaw skin without the choose option).
---
Not really, Halloween mounts were one for EACH mount. Not five for one. Why buy a pack if you only want one skin? I'd much rather buy a single skin for 800 gems max instead.
---
I don't think I'm the only one who's sick of these packs. At least, let us buy just one of the skins if we just want one.
---
Besides:  
---
* enemy stacked up in such a retarded place, they had no manouver abilities, so would have ended the same even if you came from the keep;
---
* might have as well jumped down from Air Keep wall covered by Veil with exactly the same results;
---
* squad has 20 people, so a single mesmer portal (which range is 5000, so waaaaaaay more then when you can cover with stealth on this kind of terrain).
---
Is there a reason that these People can freely behave like this? I'm sure the developers know this issue for a long time now, and the probably don't ignore this to annoy the community.
---
I'd rather have thematic packs like the branded and mad realm ones, and single-mount packs like this one, than a few scattered skins in RNG boxes, like with the beetle, or single skins for 2000 gems. like the premium skins.
---
Guess I’ll just wait another 6 months for the unique skin...
---
Twas fa, clearly this was a no comms pug ktrain just made the video for funsies
---
ty so much
---
Those people will never go away in any game, even if you find ways to detect the person who AFK andmoves ever so slightly to avoid getting botted, they will figure out that the system takes into account doing damage to enemy and then they will just run it down mid, and there is no way to "prove" this unless they say something in chat.
---
I do believe these people, no matter how technically talented they are, eventually find their way down the ranks since their attitude is almost "hardwired", they lack will power so at the sign of first hardship they drop all. AFKing is their way of protecting their ego, by blaming someone else and telling themselves that that person is the reason they lost, so the only way to make sure that self-fulfilling prophecy comes true is hijacking any chances to win by AFKing. Thing is, since they are the problem, their attitude will drag them down on the long run since they will default to that mechanism more often than others. It is a shame when you come across these people and ruin thegame for the other 9 players, but such is the nature of any competitive mode.
---
Anet tried to bring the crowd to PvP, they have actually suceeded a few times, and just recently there has been a surge of people in PvP (the ranks are going higher, which means that based on the already confirmed standard bell distribution of the population, said population is increasing). 2v2 will bring lots of people, I know Im looking forward to it, also swizz tournaments (single elimination sucks tbh). All they need to do in terms of balance is just tone down some outliers like soulbeast/spellbreaker/sw.d thief/holo/scrappers/mirage and bring up elementalist, shift power from damage to more self-sustain/defense for necros and revs.
---
Wsr and RoS are powerhouses because of strong gvg guilds, but I don't know how one pushing almost every enemy group can be considered fun.
---
Except with the Spooky/Cozy/Branded/etc. mount packs, you're buying a set of skins you could use all at once. With this you're paying more (2000 instead of 1600) and are only able to use one skin at a time.
---
Plus 2/5 are identical to the default just with slightly different dye channels. Even the old Spooky and Cozy mount packs had unique features to set them apart from the random mount licenses.
---
I have 10 characters...each would get use depending on how it fit thematically for each character
---
Remember to swap Sigil of Accuracy for Sigil of Impact on both weapons. U don't need that additional crit due to stat conversion from AR. 
---
You would still be able to do that with a different headgear item, even better if they ever add build templates and gear loadouts.
---
Just a single piece of minor gear doesn't make that much of a difference, anyways. Most of the stats are in chest, legs. So it's not like you can automatically switch builds with just one slot.
---
Thanks to their garbage marketing since PoF release I bough 1 mount skin for 1200 gems (Primeval wolf). Honestly most of the skins are pure garbage and in the case of Warclaw paying 25 USD for 1 mediocre remodel, 2 recolors and 2 mediocre reskins... well I would go and get some Pizza.
---
....and milk it and milk it and milk it.... :/
---
Ah, tag envy. Those people that for some reason can't afford a tag and feel like they just need to voice their saltiness.
---
Also people screaming at you for not defending stuff when the matchup is already decided continue to befuddle me. I sometimes PPT, but never without a purpose. 
---
Thank you for this. I was able to create a few bags without the Fury Scorched Stones. Thanks!
---
Anyone know if the peacock skin for the raptor will be back? I missed it and would love to get it :(
---
Yeah, the way this is being packaged together it's basically like selling one skin for 2000 gems and then there's 4 bonus skins you didn't care for. Definitely weird. But I'm sure lots of folks will buy them anyways. I'm considering it too. Getting separate dye channels is a pretty big deal to me, and if there's at least one skin that I like I'll probably jump on it.
---
Have they confirmed bringing 2v2 back in the near future? I missed the last one and was really upset to see that it wasn’t something that they had intended to leave in the game. I think that permanent 2v2 and 3v3 arenas would immensely help the game mode out, as would good balance as you also pointed out. There was nothing less fun than going up against the faceroll condi mirage that shat out large amounts of quick recharging conditions and more clones than you can count haha.

---
The other two literally aren't worth mentioning.
---
lol is it just me or is the head a lil on the small side when viewing from the front?
---
I definitely agree that the community is incredibly helpful in general, which I think is partially aided by the shared loot and xp, I’m never gonna be mad at someone for getting the killing blow because if we’ve both tagged the mob everyone gets credit. 
---
The other month I had a stranger spend an hour and a half running Orr meta event chains with me so that I could get a commune HP to open up. 
---
They were just farming wood for a legendary, we both added each other to a friends list and still chat randomly. 
---
I absolutely love meeting people and making new friends in the game like that. 
---
"I always get randomly frozen by something and I cannot even just reset the endfight for the achievement, no I need to do the full freaking instance from start."
---
That's wrong. There is something to interact with at the start of the Instance. You can directly Jump to the Endfight
---
Pack on all the WXP buffs and go to town!
---
They should do more of these events. Helps newbies accrue WvW ranks.
---
That's their business model. The game could not be suppoted without it. The base game is low cost and the dev and maintenance costs are paid for with cosmetics.
---
Guys, you get a AAA mmo with low cost expansions that could not fund the game on their own. And all the in game purchases are cosmetic and can be bought with in game gold. And this has been their business for 6 years. And whenever a new skin comes out, I still have to hear you all gripe rather than getting to talk about the art.
---
If i remember well there is a totem at the entrance of the cave you can interact with to skip to the boss scene. At least is what i remember...can someone confirm it?
---
That's only there if you are replaying the instance. On the first play it will not be there.
---
So you have to complete the chapter, then get the purple stars in the map for replaying.
---
Ben is still around, but I feel for him, the PvP team was already small, who knows what happened after they lost 1/4+ of the company. For all we know all thats left in the PvP team is Ben, the couple of unpaid interns and that highschool person who is just trying to get those "5 years of work experience right off college" that all jobs ask, and they have him on feedback and stat recollection. 
---
Jokes aside though, I do hope that with the recent stuff happening at Anet, they do decide to invest resources back into the game, specially the mode that has always brought streamers, youtubers, community figures, PvE/WvW on the fence, new/old players alike into a game, no matter the game, or whether it is going through a dry spell on content; human competition, specially people vs people, players vs players. The one mode that never gets boring and have a side chance of bringing drama and thus more attention to itself. I cant see a drawback to having more people to play with and having the game being more known and promoted.
---
I particularly like the bottom-left, those foo dog statues are wicked cool. Even all the little details on the building. Keep up the excellent work, this gonna look so good when finished!
---
I don't think so. ArenaNet would need to compete with Apex Legends, PUBG and Fortnite.
---
And more importantly, Southsun survival is a Battle Royale or more Last man standing game which is always forgotten...
---
I am replaying it and there is nothing
---
Nah, it looks small to me too.
---
This is just so wrong but so damn unexpected that it just made me laugh.
---
And Unbound / Volatile Magic Orbs 
---
I paid 100€ for the expansion but ok :)
---
I'm totally fine with spending 10€ on a skin but putting 5 in a box with no way to obtain the one you want is just fucking stupid.
---
Attuning to earth still gives 120 toughness, Stone Flesh trait gives even more.
---
Just afk it. Let the NPCs do the work. Stay up the ledge.
---
For raids, that's out of date since the banner changes. You'll need some extra assassin's gear most likely, but I'm not a ranger main. Best to check their discord at the moment. 
---
For fractals, it's all berserkers because of the potion giving precision for having AR (can see on the wiki for exact numbers or check discretize.eu)
---
I'm not trying to justify it and I never was. I also never said "it's like war". I said "war is war" ie: "conflict is conflict", "wvw is wvw", "it is what it is". My argument was against artificially preventing that kind of experience from happening. There is no need to justify a design decision because it's explicitly not a design decision. It's a result of the game mode. You need to justify a design decision to prevent multiple players from ganging up on single players, not the other way around.
---
No its not. Its called bundling and it happens all the time in nany different businesses.
---
No one is arguing against supporting the game. It’s HOW they choose to do it that is the issue and will hurt them in the long run.
---
People don’t want to pay more to buy things they don’t want to get the thing they do want. Anet isn’t confident enough in their own product and so they resort to nickel-and-dining their customers.
---
They don’t have to bundle skins together that people don’t want to charge more for them, that’s a choice.
---
Plenty of people would be happy to buy the skin they do want sold separately at a fairer price point. 
---
/shrug this is the sad state of the world today
---
It's situations like this that I thank the six for the block button.
---
I'm sorry people were jerks and I hope you find a nice WvW guild
---
Looks ok to me. This requires a bit of coordination and a dedicated Scrapper for every party. Enemy squad was a mess, stacked up in a choke without any possibilities to run away or even a look-out to scout the gathering enemy. Portal Bomb would achive exactly the same results. As well as jumping down from the Keep under Veil.
---
NA or EU? 
---
?
---
&gt; Commanders should try to discern the difference.
---
This is such a huge bugbear, honestly. If people are determined to see something one way, no amount of good presentation will help that. But also, if people are toxic and don't see that they are, they'll insist they're "keeping it real" and blast you for being offended.
---
No way to win from either angle.
---
Still curious as to what the requirements for Divinations will be. Wish we could get a heads up number instead of a day zero surprise you need to raid for 3 more months number haha!
---
I upgraded my PC about 3 weeks ago from an i5-2400 with a GTX-750 to an i5-9600k with a GTX 1660 Ti. 
---
It raised my open world FPS without too many other players around from low 50s to 150 or so. It raised my launch era world boss (Svanir Shaman, Fire Elemental, Ulgoth, etc.) from high 20s/low 30s to 50s sometimes hitting 60. It raised my large WB events like Tequatl, Karka, and HoT meta stuff from 20s or low 30s to something very variable, fluctuating between low 30s and up to the high 50s.
---
In other words, even with much, much newer hardware - hardware which isn't exactly top top of the line today but is still in the lower range of high end unless you want to start spending really, really big amounts of money, I'm still at times only getting 30 FPS. 
---
The bottleneck with GW2 is not really the GPU. My GPU is mostly taking it easy with this game. Rather, the bottleneck is with CPU but, as you can see with me running a CPU that's 7 or 8 years newer than the game, it's not necessarily something that you can fix just by getting new hardware. The bottleneck with the CPU is partly in the game's optimization and partly with some of the particular technical quirks of how MMOs have to work. 
---
As far as hardware, upgrading your GPU could help some, but the CPU is old enough that it might just hold back the GPU. Yours benchmarks around half as well as my old i5-2400 which was a major bottleneck. My GTX-750 was usually bored with GW2 because the CPU wasn't telling it what to do quickly enough, so if you upgrade to a GTX-750 you can expect it to really not utilize nearly all of it's power while it waits on the Phenom CPU to tell it what to draw next. The CPU, in turn, can be bottlenecked a bit by RAM speed. For example, when I upgraded my system I got 3000 Mhz RAM but never told the BIOS to run it at the 3000 so it was only doing 2666 or 2333 (I don't remember which). When I went in and set it to run at 3000 it made a very noticeable difference, as much as 10FPS in some situations and 5FPS in those big world boss events, so that is also at play.
---
When they make a new glider to match an old backpiece, those who bought the backpiece gets the glider for free.
---
When they make a skin for a new mount to match an old mount pack, you have to pay 2k gems for it and four other unrelated, unwanted mounts.
---
Logic!
---
It’s not free, I bought the core game, HoT, and PoF. They don’t choose this model as a favor to their player base they choose B2P w/ Cash Shop because it’s a sustainable model for them. 
---
Once again having a cash shop is fine but HOW you do it is important. Just read all the comments of people in here that want a single skin.
---
Also, it’s not a bundle because there’s no option to buy individual skins. 
---
An actual bundle would work like this...
---
Each skin is 500 gems, so if you want to buy all individually it’s 2,500 gems or you can buy them together all at once it’s 2,000 gems. That way Anet makes more when people buy them together but then they can also just buy them separately if they only want a few of them. They still make money in this scenario only it doesn’t force people to pay for things they don’t want in order to get the things they do want.
---
&gt; Wvw would be less toxic if anet gave full server control to the players
---
This is effectively what Alliances/WR seems like it's trying to solve; moving the burden of organization off ANet and onto the playerbase.
---
Both approaches have their share of problems - self-organization is not a panacea, but after all the time we've had under the current systems (both before links and current), just the fact that it would shake up those kinds of situations you described may be its biggest selling point.
---
$10 (800 gems) trades for just under 300 gold, which sounds good to me.
---
Omg will you guys stop complaining ffs, if you don't like it don't buy it. The game needs to turn a profit somehow to stay running 
---
Theres something at the start that you can interact with to get straight to the boss fight. 
---
Who scammed you? I payed 73 Euros (thanks to paypal converting from 80$) for the PoF Ultimate Edition.
---
what do rank levels give in terms of rewards?
---
My lord, Scrapper looks to be braindead OP...
---
It does sound good, but I haven't been playing that long so I'm not sure what the average market is.
---
&gt;Also, it’s not a bundle because there’s no option to buy individual skins.
---
This is a marketing term. Think cable channels. You can't get them separate but you would pay more for them as a group.
---
&gt;Once again having a cash shop is fine but HOW you do it is important. 
---
If it can't sustain the studio costs then that's more important. 
---
Part of the problem with this pack is the filler skins - the two basic bitch skins which don't do anything. At least with the thematic packs there are no fillers.
---
Price policy of a dying game. Nice. 
---
The mod also requires DirectX 12 support which your GPU doesn't have, and generally more recent hardware. 
---
As others stated, your CPU is hard shredding your performance (I also had that cpu in my old pc) so you should try and see if you can grab a new pc, used hardware could work if you have access to someone who can check if it's working properly. 
---
Pretty much all you can do is clean your pc and see if that helps a tad, but won't help you much.
---
Sorry 
---
Nope, 1200 gems.
---
This guy nearly enslaved my salads...
---
Excuse me while I contemplate this for an hour or two.
---
I guess he doesn't count gems there as being purchased lol
---
On my experience Desolation is usually good. I'm in Vabbi and right now is good with a lot of ppk a lot of pugmanders, but next week may go back to be nothing like it was the last month.
---
It's not just guilds, it's good or bad people who play with them as well. Some want to be carried, others just don't like playing on servers whose half population doesn't know what's voice chat or a decent build.
---
I see Dragon's Watch Dye Pack is available too, is it supposed to include all dyes (from each kit, I mean) or just one? I'm interested in the Permafrost Dye especially (Celestial Dye is too expensive...) but if it only includes one it seems a little expensive (375 gems).
---
Huh I wanted the cheetah and maybe the branded one. Kinda sucks cuz I bought the branded mount pack. 
---
Same shit on na 
---
I'm just happy wvw is getting some monetization... Hopefully more support in the future.
---
[This guy will](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b09g27/gemstore_update_warclaw_frontline_mount_pack_2000/eid1lha/)
---
All I wanted was the outrider one :(
---
It surely can't be more than 250 given the cost of the first legendary armor. At least I hope not. 
---
nothing really, but you get points to put in wvw skills.
---
you can read about the specific skills on the wiki here:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_Experience#WXP_upgrades
---
Maybe not, but they do care about people buying their overpriced gemstore junk, and the less people play (because they're fed up with the unreliable release schedule, for instance), the less people there are to buy that junk and the less people there are to show that junk off to. 
---
His account name was chocolates alt yeah.
---
I gave a guildie some bags on his second day in game yesterday and that felt pretty nice, but 50g is crazy!
---
The blue thief in my team was chocolates alt , wintrading with siki and flandre , I had to do it . 
---
&gt; and will hurt them in the long run
---
This one is debatable. It's probably true that this makes players negative towards the whole situation but I do think that this is better for them in the long run.
---
If they offer all of the skins individually players might have their "perfect" skin for the mount for a lower cost. When they release more mount skins later these players already have one and might not buy another one. However with the current system you either buy the whole bundle (you pay too much) and you probably won't buy the next skins and someone who didn't buy it might be more incline to buy the next expensive mount or bundle (also paying too much).
---
It is kinda shitty for the consumer and I'm sure Anet thinks this is how they make the most money. I can't tell if they are right but they probably have several people with more knowledge that decide these things.
---
Also sales are also more effective with these things. Players who didn't buy the expensive bundles might buy them during a sale. If these players already have the cheaper ones they bought individually why should they buy the ones they don't want even if they are on sale?
---
Well...two expansions anyway.....no third in sight 
---
Which reminds me why I stopped buying anything from the gemstore since they had first released the adoption licenses a year ago... Or almost nothing I guess. Only been buying keys like 3-4 times a year and a couple total makeover kits. Guess I won't be getting these skins either even though I want one :/
---
bros and sis need your help. I play spellbreaker for dps in fractals, and i asked my guildmates about my dps, they always say it's a bit low just like support chrono..... in golem, i do 25k, and in real fights (fractals), the burst damages I pushed out are usually 20-30% more than people who showed their high dps on youtube..... what did I do wrong? 
---
Well, at least with the filler skins you can dye the mount better.
---
I would prefer if each mount had a reward or collection that gives you a 4-channel version of the base skin, but then less people would be likely to get other kins.
---
Maybe it should start as a BL collection, like with the home garden. Get any gemstore skin for the mount, also unlock a mini-quest to get a very disable version of the base skin.
---
I know autoloot doesn't work when you die but I didn't die I was standing on the first button in the left corner which is also not that far that autoloot wouldn't work. But even if the auto loot didn't work there was no chest to interact with. 
---
Scepter/warhorn for tempest for medium/close range
---
Dagger/warhorn for close range but dagger autos are surprisingly far
---
Sword/dagger weaver for close range glassy high burst &amp; sustained damage for the cost of being vulnerable (but everything dies anyway)
---
Any mix of the bunch before, adding focus gives great utility and defensive abilities
---
Don't hesitate to swap in stuff like arcane shield for blocks and stun breaks
---
Im on NA.
---
My main is base ele, and I do run full zerker gear with scholar runes in wvw and generally have no issues staying alive and being top dps.
---
EU? NA?
---
I dout they are real people. They are likely something like life-sized minis or illusions.
---
Because when their time is up, they do not teleport away or despawn, they die. 
---
Yeah I figured it is not really "new" features but I just got the griffon quite recently, unlocked all masteries and didn't researched too much into it, I used it as an "advanced glider" and kinda knew some advanced techniques were there but didn't think it was THIS good, that's why I was mind blown seeing the video haha
---
Does it show that you did it in the API?  
---

---
You're correct, but "control" is not what I was getting at. I don't think Alliances will have any impact on the idea of "groups controlling servers" only that it will shuffle the deck more readily - and that may not end up being a good thing.
---
Anet's never proven they know how to manage populations well, imo, and it's very difficult to incentivize anti-stacking practices properly. If the alliance cap is small, and populations are large, groups will get more frustrated with a higher percentage of pugs. If the alliance cap is big, and populations just end up filling in on small numbers, we're still left with the high stacking problem we have now.
---
A number of servers on the NA side have tried to foster "militia guilds" so pugs who want to be accessible can stay so, and remain with people they don't mind working with. This hasn't worked out, because if people haven't gotten into a group by this time, they're unlikely to do so.
---
Unfortunately I think the outcome is most likely that, for all the "mobility" and "reshuffling" of groups Alliances has the chance to do, it'll end up making people even less ready and able to work together, and making tier-climbing even less attractive than it is now.
---
I'd say that a pretty decent chunk of people ended up completing Hearts and Minds (the final Heart of Thorns instance) as a duo.  Do you play on NA or on EU?
---
Guardian should be alright.  Also the way you describe playing your Dragonhunter sounds fine at least on the surface, close in with greatsword is good, longbow is terrible in PvE.  Full ascended gear is overkill unless you really want to seek it out, that said getting ascended weapons can be a decent chunk of additional damage, as well as getting ascended rings, accessories, and an amulet.
---
I actually have a non-OC'd Q6600 paired with 3GB RAM and GTX 260 and I get 25-35 FPS in LA and 40-60 FPS in open world (tested queensdale) with all settings on low (didnt use subsampling tho) at 1280x1024

"pack" FeelsWeirdMan
---
&gt;Wrong. trickle-down might rarely work in economics, but when it comes to community conduct, it is a real thing. When the average player sees that the highest profile players don't get punished for bad conduct, breaking the rules, why should the average guy follow them?
---
It doesn't start at top end PvP. It starts at the design / dev level. If the top end PvP realises that anet does not care for the mode for years straight; much less competitive integrity. In fact it constantly violates these concept through class design, balance, and so forth... How do you expect it to trickle down to PvP itself? The most dedicated PvPers treat it like a joke because the devs and community treated them this way for the longest time; not the other way around. 
---
&gt; afk leeching, toxic chat behavior, botting or griefing are part of the same issue 
---
You will see this community and subreddit have plenty of players that promote this behavior in PvP / WvW for their own gain; yet be outraged by "wintrading". I agree these are huge issues, but are the consequence of wintrades? Honestly no. 
---
&gt;knowing that I could reach a good rank if I wanted to. 
---
:))) Can't we all? Here on reddit everyone is challenger legendary or hardstuck in elo hell but an amazing player in their heart if they just tried. 
---
&gt;Participating in such an environment is just not worth the stress knowing that no matter how awful you behave, you can just truck along. Do I need to remind you of the guy that experimented with how racist you can be in chat before getting banned? I think he only got any kind of punishment becuase he reported himself with tons of evidence and it got big on reddit. 
---
Neglected by anet, hated on constantly by the community. Feedback for issues literally not permitted around here except if it puts PvP in an awful light because then it fits the circlejerk. 
---
Which creates rather stressed players that actually do want and enjoy PvP; which over time turn more toxic and resentful towards anet and other players. And here you are stating it's their fault these things happen; except neglect and a sheer lack of actual competition was a fact for years before wintrading existed. 
---
Meanwhile PvE players convincing themselves they're the nicest ever yet they won't even consider how their actions  affect other players when they AFK in PvP, WvW and do 1k dps in fractals; calling everyone else toxic and elitist for not wanting to deal with it. 
---
I agree shit trickles down, but if you think WINTRADING started the downwards spiral of PvP you're about 4 years late to the party. And this sub hated PvP long before ingame competition existed; just because it wasn't PvE. 
---
Some people are probably going to complain about this Warclaw pack, but I like it. 1200 gems for the Outrider, 400 for the Branded and Embermane and you get 2 reskins for "free". This is actually great and I doubt they would sell those separated without a price increase or some rng behind.  
---
Anyway, I wish Anet would do this kind of pack for others mounts.
---
All at the lowest
---
Yes, i guess they didn't learn much from the first mount adoption debacle that's unfortunate :/
---
A pack? That’s unfortunate. I was ready to drop some gems for one or two, but I don’t want all of them. 1,000 gems per skin I actually want isn’t too horrendous, mind. Still disappointing. 
---
Exactly.  I’d rather buy the one thing I want than a bundle of stuff I don’t just to get the one item.  Even if it’s seemingly at a discounted rate, I’m still spending on items I don’t want.

---
So instead of (random) skins you buy lootboxes. How is that any different? 
---
Ah well thank you but no thank you. I'm fine to never have bought mount skins except the spooky halloween ones and branded pack. These aren't worth it. The branded one and embermane one are the most cool out of that selection but not even that great. My wallet is happy.
---
To my understanding, Axe main hand is only slightly worse than sword. I sometimes use it when I need range for certain phases. The dodge on the sword and the autoattack are nice though. I wouldn't worry too much about the difference between the two and just pick your preference.
---
Axe off-hand is much better than warhorn though. The axe-4 hits twice if you position it correctly and hits like a truck. You usually do this skill after GS2. The skill after your GS2 does extra damage so it buffs your axe-4 even more. Also, your stances do bonuses based on each attack so they are even stronger with your axe-5. 
---
So yeah sword vs axe main hand is to my knowledge not too different, but for offhand you DEFINITELY want axe.
---
With regards to vulnerability, it is expected that other classes will cap vulnerability for you. Also, you want to get in your big damage skills in combination with your GS2 to maximize damage so you do those before the kick anyways.
---
And thats fine, they are a business not a charity, we are consumers not charity volunteers. As a consumer I spend money on deals I find benefiting to me while minimizing expenses, as a business they try to sell me stuff while maximizing profit. Nothing wrong or unethical about it. I will spend money only I see it fair, I will also voice my feedback so that they can know why Im not buying, that way they can try to come with a deal that will entice me. Perhaps im not their market and they are getting enough people to buy this deal, and thus making enough profit, and thats fine, no matter what, in every market there will always be people left out. However, thats potential profit they are missing. I have spend a bit of money in this and many other games, I know my thresholds and how and on what I like to spend it on, if I dont see a deal to my liking, i will simply spend that same money somewhere else. It is simple. But do note that feedback benefits everyone in general, by gaining over people like me and they could potentially increase their profit (or maybe they already figured out the formula and Im actually just out of their curve) who knows, definitely not me, but I do want one of the skins, but im not willing to pay 2000 for 1 mount, havent done it for the 1 mount 2000 deals, wont do it now.
---
They dont like people farming those nodes twice in a short period of time (some mins before reset and some mins after reset), even if that means farming them every 2 days, "its bad for economic balance"
---
Arenanet logic @2012.
---
But yes, they should have a fixed reset time and not a 23 hour one. 
---
Herp derp...I failed and can't figure out mechanics; SUCH A BROKEN GAME!!@$!#!! (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

---
I had someone gifting me at random and anonymous a skin.
---
I did the same and gifted one back to a random helper in pve, in map chat.
---
I suggest you try to do the same (when you can), someone will love those 50 gold ;)
---
I've never cared about mount skins, I'm not gonna start now.
---
Anet is working really hard on the skin.   Its not two years spent on a ring skin, its one year twice.  
---
I’d be curious to see the recent confirmation, because it definitely wasn’t a promise in the [article [Shacknews]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjov5H_kP3gAhUJ26wKHZMnCw8QzPwBegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shacknews.com%2Farticle%2F107195%2Fguild-wars-2-sixth-birthday-interview-mike-zadorojny-talks-the-living-world&amp;psig=AOvVaw32nBu15tuthjNelaTi_NTj&amp;ust=1552498300808146) I’ve seen usually brought up. 
---
“The promise that we're making players right now is that this season, we are planning to release a new mount that players weren't expecting. And the thing we're saying right now is, Living World is working. It's an amazing strategy that allows players to come in every two to three months, get a really cool piece of content, get a new map, play the expansion with their friends. “
---
I'm curious as well. The W1234 lego armor cost about ~12 weeks worth of LI from wings available at the time it came out, right? (now 10 for first set, 20 for second)
---
That was for a full 6 pieces of legendary gear, so if you were to translate that to just one legendary ring at a rate of 1:1 it would be 25 LD for the ring. Right now it's possible to get 7 per week, so that'd put you at 4 weeks minimum with some change left over. Probably 3 weeks once W7 is out. Or if you qualify for it still, you can convert your LI to LD.
---
Arguably the armor is way more important to have than the trinkets, so a somewhat reduced price makes sense for encouraging players to engage with the system and complete those sets. Let's say instead that the ring is primarily a vanity item (since you can't transmute trinkets other than back items anyways) and unique equip. Maybe it's a hard limit of one per account. Let's crank that cost up to a full set's worth of 150 and assume that W7 has at least 3 LD: 15 weeks.
---
I'm hoping for / expecting something a bit more reasonable like 50 LD for your first ring and maybe being able to make additional ones for 75 LD (but unique equip seems a likely case). And I really hoping it's not 77 clovers per ring but am prepared &gt;.&gt;
---
Now if only they'd introduce a graphics option to turn off skins for other players.. all these particle effects on skins are going to eat up FPS. Not to mention that I already feel an FPS hit with the introduction of just the default Warclaw mount in WvW. 
---
Reddit remembers

Changing the keybinds to something more fluid for you and it can be a  lot easier.  
---
Name dropping is a big nono on most forums. And is seem as a possible harassment before internal investigation started

bunch of psychos
---
“Shit stinks worse over there than the shit here so...don’t complain”
---
Is not the approach you should be taking. That’s how things get substantially worse. 
---
Yes, power precision ferocity.  Consider searching for "Devona" on the trading post, which will bring up the Berserker "Named Armor" for heavy armor users which can appear as drops and then be sold, far cheaper than going for the crafted versions. (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor)
---
And yeah a fair bit of that gear is just sticking with what you had from the level 80 boost.  You'll be more fragile in berserker's, but your damage output will go through the roof comparatively due to the increased critical chance and damage multipliers you'll be getting access to.
---
Well people downvoted because they don’t agree with your opinion not because of elitism. Raiding and PVP tend to be more toxic because they are competitive modes and people tend to be more stressed in them. Including the LAA and the HotM zones. But in open world people are usually more helping and sympathetic, and that’s where most of the players are, if you ask for something in the OW there will always be someone to help. Just like the story that OP told us, maybe try to stay away from the competitive modes for a while to avoid that toxicity.
---
It's better than LS2, where you have to play it first, before you can get any achievement at all^^
---
Ok so first thing first this guy was a jerk.
---
Now from what I see it seems like you were in a duel area. These aren't officials but if you play WvW a bit you get to know them. They are just areas where players who wants to duel meet and just randomly duel each other. That could explains the afk guys and the answer one of them have you. Obviously that doesn't excuse the random shitty attitude.
---
And sadly the community is awesome in open PvE but tend to get much saltier when you enter a competitive environment (PvP, raids, WvW). I guess it's a side effect of the competition.
---
I am not talking about pug groups and I am not talking about running pvt.
---
Either way, you've clearly never seen what a good ele is capable of so I wont bother arguing any further.
---
Why would I want 5 skins for the same mount? And what is the actual difference between default, assault, and vanguard skins? It looks like something I could do with the dye system as it is....
---
Wish they would have added the branded skin to the pack I already bought, btw.....would be nice to have a complete set and probably would have been the right thing for them to do, imo.
---
I'd love this. Even if there's only one for each slot and they're unique-equip to push folks to do Aurora and Coalescence to finish their slots, having a spvp and wvw accessory, ring and amulet would be a super efficient way to get those slots filled, and would encourage more folks to play the modes actively to finish them.
---
Speaking of which ... what is applying revealed to stuff like doors all the time?
---
Oops, should have put that in my other post.  NA
---
The pull doesn't matter too much in raid/fractal situations as bosses have defiance bars. The bounce also doesn't matter that much. I suppose an argument could be made that if you are in a group that struggles to maintain might, your axe 1 can help with might, but I wouldn't sweat the difference too much.
---
However, with the rotation once you understand it, it becomes much easier.I had a weird time learning Sb. I didn't realize how important combo's were with it. With other classes you can differ from the rotation and do pretty well, but Sb really benefits from a specific order. The most important thing to know is that you always use your big skills after gs2 also that your GS5 refreshes the cooldown on GS2 so you can do GS2 immediately after GS5. 
---
So a super simple rotation would be GS2-5-2 then immediately use your F3 (gazelle). This is your biggest damage combo. Ideally, you will use your stances during this, but that comes with practice. After you do GS2-5-2 F3, your GS2 should be up again. You want to do GS2 then immediately switch and do Axe 4. The axe 4 hits really hard so you want the damage boost from GS2. You need to position the Axe 4 so it is on the opposite end of the hitbox on the edge to make sure you get the double hit with axe 4. You then follow up with Axe 5 F1 F2 and auto until you can switch to GS. It is not a halfbad rotation and it actually flows really nicely once you get used to it. The main thing is to make sure you do not interrupt any of your skills and make them stop early.
---
The whole rotation is about comboing with your GS2 skill.
---
Because bans aren't effective. The chance that someone will change their ways after a temp ban isn't too high, but there is a chance. A permanent ban leads to basically two things:
---
1.  Banned player (and potentially friends) leave the game/gamemode.
---
2. Banned player decides whatever enjoyment they get from bannable offense is worth the cost of another expansion or two. Practically no chance banned player changes at this point.
---
The latter is why game company's don't like permabans, the former is an additional reason players should be anxious about permabans. PvP needs to keep what population it has if we want to convince any new player to seriously try it.
---
&gt;when I don't have anything to offer in return.
---
Nudes?
---
WOW all these people worrying about GW2 closing after ANet firings now complaining about cosmetic skins in the Cash Shop.
---
It's the same people that are sad when a store closes even though they never shopped there.
---
Either support the game or don't. But don't complain about something completely optional and cosmetic and then turn around and cry about the game dying.
---
You're probably playing the same game but not the same game mode. Player's behavior changes a lot between Open PvE and competitive game mode (PvP, McM, raids)
---
Yesterday I started working towards getting the Staff of the Inevitable and two people were asking for help on an achievement.  I helped them and then asked if they could help me take down the champions around that map which they helped me do.  
---
We ended up clearing achievements for a few hours which was super nice of them.  I tried giving them 5 gold each before logging off but they sent it back saying they were happy to help.  Good people play this game.  
---
I'm a mom to three kids.  Ain't no one wants to see that.
---
Well, if Gandara manages to repel small-minded American snowflakes then they are doing something right.
---
First you say you don't buy anything from the store but you buy keys and makeover kits and now you say you don't need keys and aren't interested in them. Why do you lie to yourself?
---
Yes please. I was just thinking about this yesterday!!!
---
You would be surprised how many people have EU accounts and are American. Great job making EU look even worse. 
---
couldn’t agree more. that’s why it saddens me to see a game like GW2 not get cool things like this
---
How come Mordremoth just ignored all that shit loads of magic sitting a stones throw from his crib nut somehow managed to get vines all the way in Diessa Plateau? 
---
you are not at fault, the raiders are the worst part of the game, they lash out on everyone. Open World and WvW is very fun and calm. In PVP you can just turn off chat and play as you please. If you want to do raids, I am afraid the best method would be to match the tone of the ones blaming you and shift blame every time they call you out.
---
Ill be honest i would pay 2k for just the branded and ember one. So to me its worth it but of course people will value things differently especially if it matches a theme they are going with.
---
Same as buying any apple product imo.
---
I’d second what someone else said in that you might want a different stat variant for your armor and weapons, and getting ascended trinkets and weapons is a decent stat increase. 
---
In terms of what stats you should go for, if you’re primarily running a DPS build (as opposed to condi) I’d suggest either [Beserkers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Berserker%27s) or [Marauders](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marauder). 
---
Berserker is generally the more “meta” of the two, but Marauders is a good alternative that sacrifices a bit of damage for more health. What you have now [(Soldiers)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soldier%27s) is what you get when you boost, but is not really a very good stat set for damage, and makes kills fairly slow. 
---
I’d also recommend looking at what sigils and runes you’re using for your armor and weapons. I don’t know the best ones for DH off the top of my head, but you can always look at sites like [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guardian) and look at their open world section for an idea of what might be the most advantageous for you. 
---
Hopefully those small changes can help you get your DPS up which in turn should help you survive better because you’re killing things faster before they can kill you! 
---
If you have any questions or need help feel free to message me here, or in game (my account name is in my flair). 
---
A couple options:
---
1. [Power Minion Reaper](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master) is the strongest solo class in the game, you could give that a try.
---
2. You could try [Nike’s Quickbrand Firebrand build](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=trm7ekgD2jU) on your guardian. It just spams Burning and Quickness and is pretty good. Still a little harder than the Reaper build, but probably.
---
3. There are a couple Thief builds to consider that are more survivable: [Bounding Daredevil](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Bounding_Staff), [Condi Daredevil](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Daredevil_-_Condi_DPS_(Fractal)). Both [evade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evade) constantly while dealing damage, making you more survivable.
---
Have to come out of lurking here to say that ESO and Fallout 76 are like night and day.

and? Only some pictures are worth a thousand words.
---
It's an expansion to a game I never had interest in playing to begin with ...
---
You would be suprised how fast I can detect an American playing on EU servers. That's why I dislike playing in the middle of the night, the cultural climate is just not the same.
---
I mean you being a red name makes you a target. Wearing my warbringer backpack makes people think im the commander and i get targeted a bit more in zergs sometimes but idc. It looks cool
---
You need rank 2000 for the highest tier of the WvW legendary armor. After rank 2k though there isn’t much of a point in the levels other than showing off. WvW in general is such a neglected part of the game that we all kind of assumed they would add rewards for higher level ranks, but they just never did. Chalk it up to one of many just bizarre decisions in regards to WvW.
---
Balthazar Inferno Bike skin RNG drop from BLchest. From ultra rare category.

There ain't even a discount for buying all five at once

and now they will totally forgot about wvwvw for another year....

Oh no, is just his teeths

Did anyone else have issues actually finding the install .exe? I cannot for the life of me get it to appear and could use some assistance. Thanks!

Have we had another pack of 5 skins for only 1 mount?

And loads more fun than "follow tag, WP if fully dead".

&gt;This person then taunts us saying nothing will happen because devs take no action.

#AAAAAND HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT!

Literally nothing will happen. **Like EVERY OTHER GOD DAMN TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.**

Anet needs to grow a spine and get their heads OUT of their asses, and start permabanning trash like this.
---
I DON'T EVEN PLAY PVP AND IT PISSES ME OFF EVERY TIME I SEE THIS RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
I can get the FPS higher by doing so, but I don't like seeing empty nameplates. I either have it set to medium or high - I don't remember which - but have the character model quality set to lowest since I don't really notice a difference.
---
My only complaint about chalice of tears was if you disconnected for any reason you needed to go back to the start or you couldn't open the chest at the end. 
---
Now I didn't even think about this the first time through and had a random dc and fought my way to the top regardless figuring out everything blind as I went (no other players were around) 
---
Got there, felt great... killed the ooze... then... shit.
---
Had to do the whole thing again.
---
This said, I love it and feel like it is a really well designed JP with some great and obtuse visual cues showing you both where to go and requiring the player to go back and look at the path from a distance and plan rather than just blindly jump forward. 
---
Welp, josh is gone so we won't be getting any more like it :( 
---
Weren't the WvW/PvP trinkets supposed to help with this with the purchasable stat reset gimmick?
---
They probably don't help that much, but I recall them getting a thing.
---
Exclusive skins + increased pip rate. The more you play WvW, the faster you earn Skirmish rewards, up to rank 10,000.
---
You can get the keep in the edge of the mists, same for tower...
---
WvW players can't even afford this
---
Then you either played with a steerining wheel, or you simply have not understand the gamemechanics. It's all a matter a action and reaction
---
What you don't hear is all the other people calling out cooldowns and other relevant info because of how he records audio. We are a very blessed group :)
---
Exactly, it is actually really well telegraphed and laid out for someone who is actually looking before they get to the point where they need to jump. And I feel like the JP even teaches people this well with the very first section when you enter the caldera. 
---
You misunderstand, I have my PVP rotation down to a science, but I'm trying to play more PVE and this PVE rotation seems easier!
---
Gw2 had this prior to launch
---
Right? Its purely cosmetic its not like its something that gives you an edge overy everyone else
---
I wish I could be this optimistic but it feels far too late.
---
They would have to make DRASTIC changes. Gamers can be very fickle, and once they have lost interest in something a lot of them write it off for good unless something huge enough happens that it gets a lot of media attention.
---
If you see gaming news/streamers/youtubers flooded with things like "GW2 PVP REVIVED WITH RETURNS OF HUGE NAMES!" or  "GW2 WVW REVAMPED, BRAND NEW MODES/MAPS AND REWARS WITH EXPANSION TIER MECHANICS ADDED" or something like that, hardly anyone who wrote it off is going to return.
---
"GW2 balances and adds more tournament reward" or anything else far too subtle/small now is just not going to cut it.
---
I tend to like the "realistic" ones more tbh. Proud owner of orca skimmer, raccoon griffon, pikachu springer, etc.
---
You described exactly how I feel. The hype is just completely gone..
---
haha okay well I am glad I could help!
---
Didn't they also give away one million dollars? Different sizes of companies here. You shouldn't be upset about a much larger company doing greater marketing.
---
And they didn't even have dragons up until this year!
---
Typically in these sorts of games, I'll look for a build and use it, but then customize bits to what I know (or find out to be) are my own weaknesses and strengths.  And that's why I'm asking for advice.  I'm just flummoxed at this point, but I am not bad at learning better given helpful advice.  For the record, I sail through most open world content.  Some story chapters (not all) are decidedly harder.
---
Why not make Aurora to cut that down to 44 :V
---
But yeah it would be great if we could get more legendary trinkets sooner rather than later. I highly suspect that with the W5-X legendary ring finally being completed we will also get one available from WvW and one from sPvP (so 2/3 game modes for a single char). LS4 might bring the second trinket which leaves us at just needing an Amulet (which I would guess will be the LS5). So hopefully by June of this year we'll only be missing the amulet slot.
---
As a PvP’er you’ll be fine. That warnings that Ele is hard is mainly for new players just learning the game. If you know the ins and outs of the class and combat mechanics, as PvPers tend to, you’ll be fine.
---
Wonder why they did this for the WvW mount and not the rollerbeetle? Maybe because 100% commited WvW players will only use the WvW mount and hopoing the skin pack will appeal to them?
---
&gt;Same.  I was ready to buy one but now I’m not sure if I’m gonna drop all the gold on the entire pack.
---
Exactly the reason why it is a 2000 gem pack because you have to pay irl money for it instead of in game gold. irl money is how the company makes money and the game continues to run. 
---
No.
---
Lol who's complaining? Shits a bag fest rn
---
This happens pretty often with training groups that *just barely* make the DPS check, lmao
---
[Meanwhile in not so alternate reality](https://i.imgur.com/hM6z6Ds.jpg)
---
I'm really curious how re-installing would make what seems to be a server sided problem to go away.
---
Spaghetti code is stronger than I thought.
---
Do you really think anet hasn't thought about what generates more profit? Clearly bundling items at higher prices yields more profit otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. People love to complain about skin quality and pricing and seem to have forgotten that this game is on death row. This pricing model is what's most profitable for anet. Complaint now but It'll be a lot worse when the game gets chopped because it isn't profitable anymore
---
A bit off topic but god the salty WvW whispers make me laugh. Was going to flip a shrine for daily and ran into some necro that killed me in the 1v1. Before he downed me someone from the other server starting attacking him. I got myself up and we killed the necro and then I left before the other guy got close to me. 15 seconds later I get a salty whisper from the Necro how he spared me and why did I attack him and I'm some cheap asshole.
---
&gt; I play on NA. I hung out around the portal for a while when I first got stuck, but no one wandered near and I feel guilty asking random strangers for help in chat when I don't have anything to offer in return.
---
LFG probably has a wider reach and therefore a better chance.
---
While going glass cannon with berserker works well it doesn't rule out more defensive approaches either. On my guardian I did all the core stuff and most of HoT with defensive gear and traits. The gear was a bit of an evolution though. 
---
What is most important is that the build matches how you play.
---
no, complain complain! but less vigorously ;)
---
Reusing model rigs isn't a bad thing, lots of creatures share model rigs throughout the game so this isn't new. The warclaw has new animations as well so it's not like *no* effort was put into it.
---
Most of the things in the game don't scare me, but the first time that happened, and I was like Wtf!!! What kind of sadistic company literally works its people to death? I just assume they respawn like we do when we die.
---
Overall, the perma merchant could use a rework; besides this, it also trolls everyone else in the area because they can't use it. Having it work like the ecto gamble portal would be better. (I use that, but I know quite a few of my friends stay away from that kind of thing due to the gambling being tempting)
---
So it's a little over 1.5 gold to buy 1 capacitor with PvP shards off the TP. The description sounds like that won't even do a full 5 trinkets, just 1 pendant, 1 ring, and 1 accessory? So... 3 gold to do a full reset, and you lose all your infusions and enrichment unless you burn another 24 silver per trinket to buy extraction devices.
---
So if you have gold to burn on this, you can fully swap your stats on 5 trinkets for 4 gold 20 silver or something. I guess that's something?
---
&gt; and you still have to deal with the trouble of losing infusions and what not. 
---
When was the last time someone actually checked that claim? The bloodstone capacitor used to do that as well but at some point they changed it from "destroy item and give you a new one" to "just reset the stat selection".
---
Then we may as well remove all extra stats from armor, keep only the armor in it, only the weapon strength in weapons, and put all the stats in the amulet for the ground and the breather for underwater.
---
I'm all in, but considering WvW just got a mount, we'll need to wait at least a year or 2 before next WvW content.
---
ESO really turned things around and are doing quite okay nowadays - for a mmo. Theres a reason why ESO is ranked above GW2.
---
At the same time though its good to remember that ESO and gw2 dont really share a market. GW2 has better open world and storytelling. ESO has better instanced content. ESO is your classic mmo experience (toned down some, but still... quests, dungeons, accomplishement driven rewards), gw2 is for a casual market, easy to get in, very much geared towards polish, convenience and gemshop.
---
What Im saying... the things that make ESO unsuited for some players are exactly the same things that make GW2 unsuited for others. 
---
Im playing both games. ESO fills my need for good instanced content and really great balancing, GW2 is for relaxed evening with friends zerging openworld or doing easy raids. Do I wish GW2 could be more like ESO? Hell, yeah. GW2 has the superior game engine (especially the better combat system). But on the other hand, both games can easily be played side-by-side. I spend half my gaming fund on GW2, the other half on ESO and have the best of both worlds.
---
We don't even know if the commander actually did receive toxic whispers or if the commander's just being thin skinned. And if they did receive toxic whispers, we don't know if those whispers were in response to them being toxic themselves.  There's just no context here.
---
I've been called toxic for telling a commander raging over a lack of callouts about incoming enemy groups, that it was in fact called out, more than a minute in advance, and they just didn't read the chat.  I've been called toxic for pointing out to a commander raging about "useless" necros and eles, that there isn't much they can do when half the zerg's guardians melt on first push and the commander continues jousting like they're all alive.
---
I've been called toxic for asking a blob guild to leave a queued map because all our t3 objectives are falling due to that group taking up most of the map limit, but all they're doing is flipping paper doors, and they're letting things fall because it gives them more paper doors to flip.  Minus the queued map part, without further information, I wouldn't be shocked if that's what happened here since this guy is only listing what he took and not what he held.  7-8 tower flips is unusual unless the commander either is ktraining, was playing a long time that day, or was on an outmanned map and just trying to retake objectives from much larger blobs that keep breaking them.  We can guess it's not the latter since the post mentions "relatively even fights."  If it's the first one, though, then the commander's most likely the one being toxic.
---
Some commanders are really thin-skinned and toxic themselves, but blame everyone else for being toxic.  We don't know if that's the situation here.  There's not enough context.
---
Oh damn I want Cantha so bad :(.
---
Wonderful artwork! 
---
They're full of delicious life force, though. 
---
Would be really nice to see a gw2 billboard somewhere in New York. 
---
I always save up gold for these kinds of purchases. It's worth it!
---
He didn't sell it... it was given for free. 
---
Jokes aside, the win was undisputed, no matter which account was used. Win trading goes into match manipulation, here Zan was simply using an account from another player. While still an offense, it doesn't affect leaderbords nor did he get any advantage over using his own account.
---
1. there are many camps so there is a mixed bag of answers though obviously the ones in the "there is only one right way to do it" camp will tell you their way is the only correct  way
---
2. you should just focus on whatever you find most enjoyable, I do a little of everything except raids
---
3. well you can buy gems with gold ...
---
&gt;  I'll look for a build and use it
---
A build is more than just the traits. It includes your armor, weapons trinkets, runes and sigils. Your equipment seems very dice rolled. If you use premade builds, you should use it as it is. Equipment for most power builds is verry cheap in the TP
---
Don't we already have enough battle royal sh... stuff?
---
Vampirism runes (forgot their name) are a fantastic set for casual play, healing 10% of your health on any kill means trash mobs become health pools!
---
Ah, well if it makes any difference, Necro’s in GW2 don’t raise human undeads, just weird fantasy creatures instead.
---
Why?
---
Welcome to the game, it's great that you're playing together! As for your questions:
---
1. This largely depends on what you're trying to get out of the game. For just running around the open world and doing story content, the best duo is the two classes you each enjoy playing the most, as tanking isn't really a thing and healers/buffers are largely unnecessary (although generally appreciated) outside late-game content like Raids. Elementalist and Necromancer is just as viable as Engineer and Warrior, so have fun and don't sweat the details. If you want to optimise a bit, having one player in melee and another at range might make your life a bit easier, but it's entirely optional. As for Raids and the like, unless you want to play a particular pair of supports that work well together (and I'm not qualified to tell you what those might be) there isn't much focus on specific synergies, with people generally being more concerned about covering all the bases and avoiding duplication. As long as at least one of you is playing a popular support build and the other is either a different one that doesn't step on the first's toes or a decent DPS you shouldn't have much difficulty finding groups. That might not end up being what you want to do with the game, as Raiding in GW2 is a decidedly different beast from similar games and isn't as central to the game's development, but if you do want to follow that path there are lots of builds and guides you can find online.
---
2. Yes. Serously though, leveling in GW2 is a much more relaxed affair than is the case in most MMOs, and basically everything gives you XP. Strictly speaking Dungeons are probably the most time-efficient option, but it isn't a race; if you want to just explore the world, hunt down Vistas and Hero Points, or just gather materials and craft all day, one way or another you'll get to level 80, so take your time and focus on learning your classes and enjoying the experience. An important tip, though: salvage *everything* you aren't using, if you aren't already, and use the "deposit all materials" option (click the little gear at the top of your inventory) to keep your bags relatively clear. You'll end up with a decent reserve of crafting materials by the time you get through leveling, which is important as crafting is one of the easiest ways to get late-game gear. Also, enemies reward more experience depending on how long they've been alive, and the passive enemies tend to be ignored by most players, so if you just want to fight enemies they're a great resource.
---
3. After a fashion (heh), yes - almost all the full outfits are bought with Gems, but you don't have to buy Gems with cash, you also have the option of buying them from other players with Gold. It's an expensive proposition, particularly for newer players, but it is technically possible to buy everything available in the game (aside from the expansions themselves) without paying a cent of real-world money. There are also a lot of great skins that are obtained through other means like crafting or seasonal events, and a few that are unique to Renown Heart merchants, so keep your eyes open for anything you don't have unlocked yet - I've been here for years and I'm still finding stuff I missed on the first pass.
---
That should about cover it, but if you have any other questions or just want a hand with something feel free to ask, here on Reddit or in-game (If you're playing on the NA server, that is; my account name is in my flair, although if you don't have the expansions yet I'll need you add you to my friends list to whisper or mail you, so drop me a line here first). Helping new players is always fun, and the seasonal event starting in a few weeks can be a bit of a pain without guidance, so don't hesitate to ask. Good luck!
---
Which leads to less people buying since they don't feel like wasting money, whereas selling the same packs for half the price would lead to more purchases, and thus more revenue.
---
Yes
---
This was from Saturday 3/9.  I wasn't commanding on Monday and was only there for half of raid but I'll pass the message on.  I appreciate the compliment nonetheless, thank you.
---
Also ty for the catch in my description.  Maybe I just wanna double up on mondays who knows :\^)
---
But honestly considering layoffs and their general hush hush was with that sort of stuff, I doubt many, if any, outside Anet knows that status of that.
---
You obviously weren't clear in your post. It could be anything, it could be last week's patch
---
Did you say the size of the update? Nah
---
Did you say when was the last time you patched? Nah
---
Weekly patches happen on Tuesdays usually. 
---
you make a complaint with no information about arena net not giving you information. 
---
See the irony?
---
There is no real end game tbh. For me personally end game is wvw. For others its pvps or pve raids/ fractals etc. U do what u want basically.
---
Max lvl is 80. 
---
Dungeons are pretty pointless but gearing is fairly easy. There is no gear upgrade in this game. The best gear you need is ascended gear. Legendaries offer significant convenience but no stat benefits.
---
If you have full ascended u can't fall behind on gear even if u quit for like a year.
---
The only pay2win element in this game are the expansions and the elite specs that all classes get with them. If you have the expansions there is no pay2win elements. Everything else is purely pay for convenience/fancy looks. 
---
As a European as checking in (apolgoy for bad English) This fool is narrow-minded( i think thats how you say) and toxic. We do not all share his stupid viewpoint
---
Lefrere has gained rating while in offline mode/sindrener not streaming so I don't know what you are on about?
---
I'm kinda mad the branded warclaw has to be purchased like this. Should be sold separately for those who own the original branded pack.
---
Yeah, even if they make you pay 400 gems for it, but branded owners should be able to get it directly.
---
We don't know this I think it depends on if those writing the stories were laid off. I'm hoping for part 2 this week but the images are also from community members so they need to wait for those.
---
&gt; But don't complain about something completely optional and cosmetic and then turn around and cry about the game dying.
---
One of the reasons the game is dying is the utter lack of rewards, so yes, this is perfectly fine complaining about.
---
Again, it depends, and we would need some context.  Some players feel that telling them to get on a proper class and build is toxic behavior.  Some players think telling people to stay on tag is toxic behavior.  Obviously if the guy was telling him to kill himself or something like that, then it's not acceptable.  But again, we got very limited info from one side of the altercation.  
---
holy shit. actually good retal. Sign me up
---
1. There's no "best" as builds change a lot, but I'm yet to see a place in which an extra warrior or mesmer won't be welcomed.  
---
2. Do whatever you want! Whatever you find fun! There's no strict requirements on anything, and you can go back to lower level content with your characters as they get scaled down to that level, so the content won't be trivial.     
---
Whatever you do, that's the endgame! Because the endgame is *more* of the game!    
---
3. Playing you can get mostly armors. For outfits and other fancy visuals you have to buy them with gems. If you can't afford getting a few gems once in a while, you can slowly buy gems with coins in the gem exchange tab in the Trading Post panel.  
---
&gt;	Sure PvE can be fun to play and sometimes watch, but human interaction and competition is what drives majority of gamers I have come across
---
You are *massively* underestimating the number of PvE-only players.
---
I for example have very little interest in competing against other people. It’s just not in my nature. I get little satisfaction from defeating someone else. I am very far from alone in this.
---
Probably awhile, considering the circumstances.
---
It's a shame too because they were *really* well written. I just wish that lore was ingame.
---
Yes absolutely sure. 0% load 
---
Yes?
---
why didn't they make a tiger lookalike warclaw skin, i want to ride tigers damn it!
---
I cannot record it, but if you'd seen what I witnessed in those attempts...
---
 AI of the fight is severly broken. The beast gets stuck sometimes in the fall left tunnel and doesnt move for literally minutes. And yes the freeze must also occur somewhere at the end of the ramp. I got hit there several times when the beast was more than 1200 unites away (my max range as Ele)
---
1.) There really isn't a best "duo" especially for core world content. I would suggest one of you pick a class with a higher health pool like Necromancer, Warrior or Ranger if one of you wants to play something more squishy like Elementalist or Thief because those two classes take a little more mechanical skill and the fact they both use a lot of active defenses, like blinds and blocks to make up for a lack of hit points.
---
2.) Exploration and gathering, mostly. Completely exploring a map gives a fairly sizable XP bonus as well as loot. Completing all the maps in the Core World maps will give you the achievement for World Completion as well as 2 Gifts of Exploration for making Legendaries.
---
3.) You can exchange gold for gems but otherwise sadly no.
---
the pet garm also interacts with it. It is not just braham as NPC running around.
---
Really awesome painting, im relatively new to game, please could somebody tell me where is location on down left(samurai one), never saw that one
---
You can create a new character with that name for free, or you can rename an existing character to that name with another name change contract.
---
It's funny how this solution actually addressed the complaints we had about mount skins, while also satisfying no one.
---
2K for a skin is too much--okay now you get 5 for 2K.
---
RNG for skins feels bad- okay now you get them all but you have to buy them all too.
---
Let us pay more than RNG price to just pick a skin we want- ok you can do that just pay 2K and have them all.
---
If Anet sold each skin for 500 gems we could pick what we wanted and collectors would pay 2500 gems for them all. But Anet knows how to make more money: make everyone pay the 2K.
---
This is why I don't take Spvp seriously anymore since after S6. The whole game mode was reduced to a dumpster fire with clowns and burning confetti running the mode. Organized play getting ATs sold twice, ranked getting win traded at the top end all the time, with all the exploitative bad practices that has been present since S1. Lack of severe consequences from devs/anet to deter continued bad practices. It's really a motivation killer to play and take the game mode seriously with competitiveness in mind. 
---
These mounts are as ugly as anets heart. 
---
This is how I feel when I ride my warclaw into battle with my Asura. Captures the moment well. Love it
---
Honestly I wish WvW was more dynamic like this.  Beef up the NPC's in the keeps and allow all sorts of chaotic movement like this.  I've long been a proponent of things like Shadowstep being used for infiltrating walls.  We need more of this not less of it.
---
Your the man. Got jacandra, owl, and a bear last night. Idk if it’s the right bear but it’s bear like lol. Thanks 🙏 
---
WvW pugs are usually clueless zerglings who can't do anything without a tag. 
---
Just dropping by to say great job Zorav (and the rest of the Collective!). Really excellent quality for a good cause.
---
And the argument would be as it was then,  "people would only log in at each reset".  As it is now, rich nodes reset 24 hours from last use, per person. Regular nodes respawn faster than old times. They seem to take only 60 min now. 
---
always felt that quasi-perma-fields on gyros was a bad idea since they posted the pre-release notes, we can expect anet nerfing 'em within a patch, so let's enjoy(?) that while we still can
---
[Enjoy!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Updates)
---
D’aw thanks! It means a lot coming from you. Thanks for supporting us the last two years!!
---
I’m sorry, why are you being so sassy to me? I’m just asking for help.
---
but their new tech allows for faster (skin) releases, this is what we were told to expect in the promised land
---
&gt; EDIT: Why I'm getting downvote?
---
It's Reddit. Some people will downvote *anything*. Just ignore it. Even the stickied Q&amp;A thread gets downvotes. 
---
Makes sense haha
---
Don't always expect it to be easy first time through.  Like others have said note what the mechanics of the fight are during all phases.  For guardian, unless you want extreme range scepter/focus does well, and focus has a timed invulnerable or 3 hits.  Also, if trying to melee the boss and they are a bit tough, range them and keep moving if necessary.  And, think about setting your utilities on whether you need offense or defense and whether you mainly plan to melee or range.    Also, dodge, weave, roll can be your friend.
---
I solo'd HoT story on 5 classes to get 5 full versions of Caladbolg (didn't want to keep reskinning it), and being tops in dps will never be my thing, rotations beyond 5-10 keys ha!.  I kinda am the pug of pugs.
---
Next, I sometimes learn from other's comments or figure out myself how to find ways to make it easier. I find I get by on getting to know mechanics not burn killing something.
---
For example, last HoT fight, hearts and minds, during updraft phase there is a tree limb you can glide to and land on and not have to worry about getting knocked out of the air from. 
---
Or, Bitterfrost story in the cave, for the first 3 fights there are steps against the wall you can climb and range everything from without taking damage.
---
and thats fine, there are kind of people out there and markets as well, however, if you look at numbers only, the most popular games out there are all mostly PvP; LoL, CS:GO, DOTA, Overwatch, Fortnite, Apex Legend, For Honor, Rainbow 6, to name a few. Whereas PvE games usually "fly under the radar" like Warframe, No Man's Sky, WoW. They are certainly popular too and got a big number of player, but they barely get any views on stream when compared to PvP games, heck even GW2, you go to the streams and most of the time that I have checked, the people playing WvW or PvP are the ones with the most views. PvE is fun to play, not so much to watch, PvP can be both viewed and played. 
---
I never implied the PvE is less, both crowds are huge (and overlapping), however, PvP is by far more popular now a days in gaming as far as all metrics that Im aware of(not just views, but also profits, subreddit sizes, youtube coverage, esports, websites tracking in-game info, etc.)
---
Never been to this site, went to Ranger builds as that's my main and it says NO with an explanation why. Okay, my alt is Thief, same thing. Was really hoping it was just a troll website telling you why each class sucked. Turns out I just play sucky WvW classes.
---
depends on what you mean by "streamlined"
---
right now, every fractal starting at 20 (goes up until 100 now if you haven't done them in a long time) has things that activate agony. Traps, checkpoints, certain enemies, etc. As long as you your resistance matches or surpasses the amount recommended, then you only take 1% of total life per tick of agony, with the amount of damage taken increasing the less resistance you have
---
For the same reason the shadowstone quest or hell, that mini story with the asura and her moa, are never getting a continuation. 
---
Was thinking the exact same thing, poor little thing
---
you do realize that chances are anet is gonna include all these warclaw skins within other licenses at 1200 for one and 400 (RNG) or create a license of it's own for these at any given moment?
---
this is a bundle, not a "permanent item" they're going to remove it within a couple of weeks, cannot wait? buy 'em all for 2k gems and stop complaining, got some patience? wait a couple of weeks and buy 'em individually for 1200 gems or play gatcha for 400.
---
Before complaining for stupid things remember, there are other games out there where you get A SINGLE MOUNT for 35+$ with no way to get 'em with in-game money. 
---
You're indirectly taking damage from said enemies, so yeah it sounds about right to me.
---
Honestly Scrapper seems to be broken in both PvP and WvW now, so I hope they get toned down a bit.
---
Berserker's an excellent choice for PvE, where you're either fighting limp noodle enemies, or bringing a fully equipped balanced party to fight overtuned enemies. Higher DPS (via power/precision/ferocity) in PvE means quicker kills since there's waypoints everywhere.
---
WvW is a different beast - there are very few waypoints, and most of your time spent in WvW is walking between places. Walking is boring. Walking sucks. If you die, you have to walk from your spawn again... Basically you want an extra bit of Vitality (more health) or Toughness (more armor) for Wvw, plus some half-decent damage, to avoid dying quite so often. Additionally, your enemies can rally off you if you die, so you want to avoid annoying your allies by rezzing your foes via dying.
---
I can understand that, I think it's important to let people invest as deeply as they want - I know I have about 3 characters I'd eventually like in full-suit legendaries.
---
As a stop-gap though, I still think wvw/spvp items to fill the existing gaps would be a good idea, whether or not they do anything fancy with them.
---
well, obviously not your face because you only got a lightbulp
---
Yes, though 100CM is no longer Nightmare but Shattered Observatory, (no idea how far back you left). Either way it's enough for both 99 and 100 as far as agony alone is concerned.
---
[The face of kindness.](https://imgur.com/9wZveZc)
---
Yes, I have...
---
That was in reference to the way they bundle things together rather than letting people buy separately... not the actual price of an item.
---
When Anet's grand quest to make GW2 a competitor in the Esports world crashed in flames, PvP went the way of vanilla dungeons.  It's now a place to farm tokens for the mini llama, or a place to buy speed clears for God of PvP title.
---
Power yes, Zerk mostly, marauders sometimes if you're feeling squishy (or in my case lazy).
---
Meet half way, and make the 2nd ring and accessory dummy-legendaries gated behind crafting Aurora and Coalescence. That way, it’s possible to get more, and incentivises getting the ‘legit’ legendary trinkets 
---
&gt; I have so much faith in the mode
---
I thought you played 5.6k games in this mode. Was it with your eyes closed?
---
Joining squad is just a matter of sharing boons/buffs/condi cleanses realistically, and it's easier to follow the commander if they talk only in the squad.
---
But just joining the zerg and fighting when the blob fights is perfectly fine. Try to join the TS/discord if possible though.
---
And running DPS herald specifically, berzerker is fine. If you don't feel like you're doing enough, maybe just take a look to see how you're supposed to play? Prioritizing certain skills for massive dps (CoR is your priority skill here).
---
It might also just be a matter of expectations. Coming in from PvE, you might not be used to how long players are supposed to take to die in WvW. 
---
It's also this way if you simply delete a character, the name stays reserved for you for a day before it goes back up for grabs
---
# BUBBLES! 
---
Ahem. Sounds silly.
---
Uhh what about the Dye Packs? 
---
Hand coded by different people who likely were not talking to each other, they made the systems and they worked and it shipped without any further thought.  
---
There have been a few times where they went back to correct (normalize) code like that, but generally only when the code fails irreversably or they're already doing a major overhaul.  
---
Not ideal in the least, it's just how it is. :(
---
I get that, just like have you tried turning it off and on again.
---
But I have never heard such a weird answer to any similar issue. Which might just be because I haven't searched for it myself. But I doubt I would give it as a "fuck off" answer in this case.
---
&gt; **I know myself personally I** saw Guild Wars 2 grow over a lot of time 
---
We get it, it's you.
---
I did it with another dude. Basically one does the encounter, the other stays on the cliff. 
---
I really like the branded one, and the fire themed one. The leopardy one looks a little derpy and the other 2 look a bit too plain/similar to default mount in my opinion.
---
&gt;A fucking skin pack costs more than the entire game now.
---
This logic is so annoying to see all the fucking time. Guys like you literally only pay once or twice for an expansion. *That's it*. You're done. No sub fees, the base game is free to play, and you can convert gold to gems. Gemstore is purely cosmetic and convenience.
---
Sub fees these days for AAA games are what? $13/mo.? Free to play came out 43 months ago that would've been $559 if you wanted access every month. Right now, the expansions are bundled for $50 (honestly don't remember the pricing when they first released). If you were a brand new player who started when F2P became a thing, you'd have spent only $50+ for 43 months as opposed to $559. In another case, if since release then add 3 years which like another $50 (or whatever it was when it came out) + $468 more in potential sub fees. Now extrapolate all the cheapskates including myself who don't even pay a single cent except for expansions.
---
No, no it's not. Or else why would it try to find it for them?
---
It's literally a one-click solution to install, and keep updated, ArcDPS without knowing what any of it does.
---
if every node had the same 22-23h timer it wouldn't matter too much, but some node reset after 2x h, some after 24, some at daily reset, some on map change and so on. I get they don't want people to do pre and post reset runs, no matter how insignificant it is (they'd just farm every 2 days instead of daily as you said), but if that's their reasoning, a 22h timer for every node would be much better. I think winter berries are like that, they reset after less than 24h, so if you generally farm them daily around the same time you rarely have problems, even if you're a bit earlier one day.
---
Outrider is so creepy. It looks wrong, so wrong. Considering a very good majority is charr players in wvw. Almost obnoxious.
---
Give me a couple of hours, I'll edit the master branch README with a few instructions.
---
this still leaves us both aurora, and as it looks to far, the raid ring being only craftable once per account, which is just unnecessary.
---
just slap a "unique" tag on there already, anet, and let us purchase the achievement gated gifts multiple times.
---
Just bought the 2 things you have left on market wish I knew about this sooner I want that twilight pin
---
I don't rlly care enough to argue about what would generate enough profit lol. I will say that restructuring of this nature is like a cancer diagnosis for companies: a few come out on the other side better/more profitable but most end up gone. Welcome to how reality works as you so kindly put it haha
---
it sounds counter productive; but the best way to avoid a lot of damage is to pack a lot of damage (especially true in HoT and PoF); with pvt (POWER/toughness/vitality) you're going to end up eating a lot of damage as you try to chip away at mobs; with berserkers (POWER/precision/ferocity) most stuff will die in a single combo; this will also help you do more with limited playtime
---
The dive achievement broke my heart.
---
I am not a pro gamer.  I'm a little arthritic.  I wanted to get my mastery points all done so I could start earning spirit shards in Core.  So I thought hey, putting on goggles and jumping in water is fun and easy.  This is something I can probably accomplish.  Just travel the world and jump into water!
---
Then I got to the aetherblade one and it was so mercilessly unforgiving.  Challenging is one thing but this JP is just mercilessly unforgiving.  I didn't ever make it to the goggles.  I just decided this mastery point would be one I never earned.
---
Sad.  I was having fun doing cannonballs into water.  I didn't expect this level of absolute PAIN in such a cheerful, casual achievement.
---
Way too soppy and apparently not proofread either. 
---
I'd say they're still miles better than almost every other cash shop out there. Besides BLC and mount licenses, GW2 doesn't really have much in the way of microtransaction loot boxes, and they at least listened to and acted on feedback about the licenses to make a relatively happy medium. That being said, these Warclaw skins (and most microtransactions, regardless of game) should have more options in how to buy them, especially if Anet wants to maximize the amount of purchases. I'd imagine that the amount of money gained from those who buy the pack but would only purchase a few if sold separately is relatively small compared to the potential money lost from those who would only buy a few separately (and there would certainly be people who would buy the full pack in each situation). Ideally, we'd be able to buy them for 500/600 each, then have the 2000 gem package as a deal for the enfranchised and the "whales."
---
outfits do allow for headgear hiding. but thats it.
---
TBH you just sound like a giant apologist for wintraders at this point -- coming up with every reason you can to excuse the inherent toxicity in the practice. 
---
 Any time any form of cheating is allowed to flourish without any repercussions, it fosters a sense of "cool, this is okay here", which *absolutely* contributes to how safe people feel botting and trolling and afking and a dozen other awful behaviors in-game. When doing these things isn't punished, more people do it. When more people do it, it becomes normalized. When it becomes normalized, even *more* people do it. All of these behaviors are part of the same toxic gaming culture, and that culture *absolutely* affects the playing experience of everyone who plays at every tier *even if they never directly encounter a wintrader*. 
---
I'm not saying the wintrading came *first --* I'm saying that your statement that it doesn't affect people in lower tiers is absolutely wrong. If you honestly think that wintrading isn't an actively contributing part of the problem, you're either very naive or are being willfully ignorant about how culture is formed and what effect it has on those immersed in it.
---
For such a fun combat system, it also saddens me that we only get 3 raid bosses a year. 
---
Anything outside of Living Story and Gem $tore is pretty much in maintenance mode because not deemed profitable enough. GW2 once diversified into multiple game modes and now it's taking back everything you fell in love for.
---
Jeebus bleepin’ cripes. This is the epitome of gw2 subreddit karma farming.
---
Thank you - with your original comment as well as this one you have fulfilled my expectations of the type of response the average player can expect upon expressing any difficulty with GW2.
---
how are they going to upcharge you to 1200 gems if the choice is free
---
Hardly any progress. I tried to do it just to get the warclaw and extra progress on reward tracks, but I find WvW so tedious I'd just turn off the game after 45 minutes or so and go do something else.
---
Yesterday I followed a commander that I have followed previously and had good experiences with. I was on discord with them (I always join voice, so long as it's a server I've been invited to) and I've always found him and his guildies to be pleasant enough to run with, too.
---
But for some reason yesterday he was just fixated on this one side of this one keep. It was heavily seiged, the defending force was definitely very present, and they weren't really giving us fun fights, either -- just poking a little bit  every now and then, mostly just sitting up there repeatedly destroying our own seige with theirs. (They kept sending in a succession of invis scrappers to disable our trebs, and despite several of us calling out what was happening, the commander clearly wasn't really listening because he seemed surprised that it happened *every single time*. A couple of us in comms were doing our best to try to catch and stop these guys, but without more help our options were limited. The pugs didn't understand what was happening because they were too busy poking at anything that moved outside the choke out of sheer boredeom.) He also didn't seem to hear anything that was said in voicechat about actively incoming zergs, or enemy taking nearby keeps and likely circling around to our position, etc. He just... really wanted to break down this one fortified wall, despite the fact that they were repairing faster than we could break it and most of us were just standing around sitting on our hands or uselessly attacking in the general area of the catas hoping to catch out the scrappers.
---
I don't mind poking the same keep for a long time if we're getting fun fights, but we weren't -- PPT was literally dropping tiers while most of us waited for something to happen. In the end, I decided it wasn't worth my time anymore and left to find another commander on another map. But I would *never* send him toxic or mean private messages because of this experience! Maybe he was distracted, maybe he wasn't feeling well, maybe his goals and mine were just different -- I don't know -- but there is *never* any excuse to be mean to people. 
---
Yeah, I would've picked up the top hat, but it not on sale on the gemstore sadly, so i have to make do with no hat Mr. X.
---
U can get the Mist Trinkets in the PvP and the WvW. Both has a little Item who u can simply reset the stats and all stats are activatet on this Trinkets. 
---
That's why they say to write things down seven times, then you've already won 4.5 battles!
---
They're still better than most, as you don't have to buy things that let you socket your gear/have a higher level gear/etc.
---
Hey thanks for spoiling it for me!
---
Event objective: Victoriously flee for your lives back to the safety of the keep.
---
but pvp is dead
---
I received my package yesterday. We were all very impressed with the quality of all of the items. My husband couldn't stop playing with the dice. He was shocked they were actually metal and such weight to them. 
---
Even the box it came in was impressive!
---
I'd argue that PvP lacked support way before they cancelled their esports. They put the cart before the horse - they pushed esports before PvP had a solid foundation.
---
A lot of people *like* the basic recolors, believe it or not.
---
Just to add on, chronologically it's Sea of Sorrows -&gt; Edge of Destiny -&gt; Ghosts of Ascalon. They can also read [The Movement of the World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Movement_of_the_World) which is a much broader write up of events that happened between the end of GW:EotN and the beginning of GW2.
---
Did you play PoF? If you did, they added 2 fractals, 2 raid wings, and like 4 or 5 living story episodes.
---
lets be honest its pretty simple - 2 skins are amazing, 1 is okay, and 2 are garbage. thats why they are sold as a pack :D
---
First piece of advice:
---
Don't refer to your partner as "hubby", "wifey", or "babe" in map chat please. 
---
That's no reason not to implement such an important QoL feature as templates that do not depend on going around with legendary gear or countless sets of gear. 
---
Most stats are not unique to maps, and they are an unreliable method to get locations populated. Look at bitterfrost. It's more effective to gather with several characters than doing the meta event.
---
And you can make the currency required to switch obtainable by salvaging stuff that is obtained from those maps. For example, there's dark energy and dark matter, those could become salvageable, and the items obtained from that used to switch stats. 
---
Or make the currency directly obtainable in those maps, with  caps per map. 
---
Rather than not adding something good to keep an unreliable method of populating maps working, a better more reliable method should be implemented. 
---
For example, monthly achievements should return in the form of quarterly achievements, that instead requiring to grind a few things (Kill 1000 rats), require completing many different things (complete every world boss meta), and give extra bonuses for it each thing quarterly. Do a meta on a map daily, you get the usual meh rewards. Do the quarterly run, you get truly juicy stuff. That oughta work better than relying on people wanting to get another set of selectable trinkets, or Seraph or Plagedoctor stats.
---
thank you
---
I think I remember an order from you recently (last week, two weeks ago? hard to keep track)! Glad the order came in soundly! The dice were a lot of fun for myself and Sara to design. You’d be surprised with how many little things go into them. 
---
No; I have a particular hate for how this subreddit won't allow any healthy PvP discussion yet it's most upvoted threads in relation to PvP are stirring drama and selfrighteous bullshit like "if PvP was this and that i'd bother and be amazing!". 
---
Wintraders can go fuck themselves, but this community fucked PvP even more so. 
---
If you think this subreddit and the gw2 community is any less to blame for the state PvP is in than the wintraders then you're equally naive and / or willfully ignorant about how culture is formed and what effect it has on those immersed in it.
---
I never advocated normalizing it. I am just rather bored of random carebears going "I don't pvp but i'm outraged and this only makes me hate PvP more". 
---
Thanks! Unfortunately that location isn't in-game. It's in reference to a continent/campaign that was playable in the first game, as well as a small neighborhood in Divinity's Reach. Developers had to nuke the neighborhood over some outside issues leaving only that giant Collapse behind. 
---
Alas, that poor feline.
---
The two crazies really appreciate your kind words! It means a lot to us that people have a good time with these projects. We enjoy making them, but sharing them is like spreading a tiny bit of ourselves (with our experiences) to others. Thank you for supporting us!!
---
&gt; How long are things considered spoilers
---
&gt; For story content the time is 28 days since the content was released.
---
250 -&gt; 300.
---
A bit less progress than it felt like, but it was really fun! I'll stick with it to unlock Warbringer, which I probably still won't get for another 6 months. I hope they bring back Call of War more regularly, and that some of the PvE players stick around.
---
I mean I'm super close to getting into the top 250 and I just want the title (first PvP season for me) but seeing shit like this makes me not really wanting to bother anymore. 
---
Yes, just about two weeks ago. I am so in love with it. Thank you so so much.
---
It has too much of everything except for what it needs. :/
---
You can craft 2 Quips for less gold than 1 HOPE.

---
Man i would give my soul out for a copy of TT...Such a cool way to show your love for a game,damn.
---
I’m very glad! And glad it arrived safely too. Many hugs!
---
&gt; All we know is they just don't post. 
---
Isn't that enough to judge how "lively" a part of game is though? Can you point me to *any* lively, large community that stays silent about the thing they enjoy, when they're a part of discussion board about it?
---
I mean, look at WoW and its forums/sub - *everyone's* shitting on Blizzard, and rightfully so. Enough people care to pay and play it, just to throw $$$ at Blizzard and tell them to suck a fat one. With certain GW2 aspects people stopped caring to even complain. At this point hate would be better than overwhelming apathy.
---
If they let the precursor become craftable more than once there's no way it would be free (if that's what you're suggesting). It would more likely have a recipe similar to the gen 2.5 legendary precursors.
---
Even if the precursor *was* free, it would only cut out \~450g.
---
Hey guys really confused about builds regarding boon support chrono. I am looking at dT SC and metabattle and all of them have different combinations of gears focused on. 
---
Context: I am new to the class but not the game. Currently leveling mesmer from scratch as i want to main Chrono for my friends as they are new and have no interest in chrono. Fractals will be my short aim reaching 100 and eventually doing cm. 
---
Lost : SC is usually my go to site but their builds are for speedrunning so am not sure if less BD is ideal. Will 6 pieces of diviner armor mixed with assassin's trinkets be good enough or should i go for a mish mash ? Also why does dT have more diviner gear in fractals when you get more duration from pots?
---
I don't particularly care what you wish to argue. Because it was never an argument to begin with. Had you actually read what I wrote, you would know that. Instead you made assumptions, then tried to pass them off as facts. Then conveniently don't care enough, when i'm pointing out the mess. But whatever you say. 
---
Just give us a wardrobe for ascended gear so we can unlock it and access it from all our characters, I'm sick of bank wars 2 to swap gear across characters.
---
&gt;It’s not free, I bought the core game, HoT, and PoF.
---
This is not enough to sustain their development costs and you 100% don't get that. Their entire business model is based around making some money from B2P, but paying for recurring development with cosmetics. That's why other games have MONTHLY SUBS. 
---
Now you know why the game is bleeding players, and studio is bleeding money.
---
Love the art, fantastic! Though is there any chance of a version without the Asura? 
---
That means you put out.  Someone wanted to see it more than once, right?
---
200g after 8 hours is still pretty shitty tho.
---
And no, a friend of mine also wants to understand whats so great about RIBA - he also thinks its not paying well. Were testing for couple hours in the last week or so. Imo there are better farmingspots out there.
---
I'm farming 61 fractals and get my 35g/h + relics so don't really care much about RIBA tbh.
---
First - keep in mind that I don't think the builds have been updated to the latest patch, so you might see changes.
---
SC builds are raid builds while dT offers fractal builds. This is where the difference comes from, as the support chrono role in a 10-man case is somewhat different from that in a 5-man case.
---
For Chrono in raids you generally have a second chrono that helps extend boons through Signet of Inspiration (through Blurred Inscriptions in the Inspiration ine), so you don't need as much boon duration compared to if you are solo. In fractals you don't have a second Chrono to extend your boons so boon duration has to be higher.
---
First off, like you hinted at, Fractals assume you have potions running (specifically [mobility](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Mist_Mobility_Potion) giving concentration and [offensive](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Mist_Offensive_Potion) giving precision). You'll see on dT that the gear changes as you have more AR though most people only run around 150 (giving 225 concentration or 15%). 
---
Second, in fractals you are only 1 chrono. You don't have a second chrono topping up boons with [SoI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Inspiration), hitting people with [Tides](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tides_of_Time) (can hit all 10 in raids), or dropping a [timewarp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Time_Warp) on the group. Previously in raids you wanted around 65% and 80%+ in fractals but most fractal builds aimed for 100%. Now with the recent patch it got even harder to maintain boons so I'm sure you want 100% in fractals. It should be mentioned that very fast groups can prestack boons and kill before they run out with full berserker stats but it's not something I would recommend.  
---
I would suggest waiting for the sites to update (it's only been a week, give it time) before fully gearing right now but dT is trying to get as much DPS as they can while running a different build since they only hit 5 targets and have no other support. Eagle runes, Illusions trait, and they can't always take time warp.
---
&gt; Seems anet thinks the better market to sell to are the folks with no self control, patience, or cash whales.
---
Unfortunately the last half-decade or so of gaming, and not just their monetization, has fostered that exact mentality (first two, unfortunately game devs won't stuff loads of money into our pockets to make us whales), and it's working time and time again.
---
Also to **add on top** of what Etheri said; 
---
It actually does harm our closed groups, especially when it comes to the groups I play with who try stealth engage tactics against bigger groups than our own. We'll all have stealth (which used to require significant planning prior to sneak gyro rework but my point is still valid) and random pugs will be following us directly telegraphing our position to the enemy group. Rare are the groups stupid enough not to understand when they see a handful of random players moving confidently towards their big zerg that there is a group in stealth ready to ambush them. We even try to communicate politely to them that they're hindering us and more often than not I'll be replied to harshly or ignored. Shoutout to the people who try to distance themselves and listen to our request :)
---
&gt; Now it's big packs and lootboxes like all the rest.
---
I know you're grasping at straws but this is a huge stretch. I agree they handled this skin pack poorly but its still leagues better than most games. 
---
Counter argument is that making you want to log in twice and play the game more is as or more beneficial for the game's life than a very small qol change.
---
The twice told legend achievement was introduced into the game for those people that crafted 2 of the same legendary weapon before they released the wardrobe (since you can't put the skin into others), so it was just like a "sorry" and here you get an achievement and a tittle in exchange. Gen 2 were created after that, so even if I can understand your petition, that achievement was for only Gen 1 legendary weapons.
---
Why go back? If you value your time, dont go back my friend.
---
Thank you? I don’t see it as exploitation if I’m in a position to afford it, it’s optional, and I’m in no way being forced to pay for it. 
---
Yes you get boonduration and additional precision/toughness from fractal potions.
---
Thats why equipment and food differs so much. Its not required running full Diviners set in fractals, you'll reach about 90% boonduration with trinkets alone so just get up to 100% and leave the rest Berserker.. maybe full diviners if you plan for raids etc..
---
As for 100% crit, don't see much use for it on support.
---
