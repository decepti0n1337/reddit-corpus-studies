Not to be mean, but this is a stupid question. It hasn't changed in years.
---
---
---
The track record of the developer this year has been... bad. quite bad. 
---

---
No (meaningful) content developed for GW2, side projects canceled by the publisher and forced lay-off of roughly 1/3rd of the company.
---
The more frequent updates you see now is the forced refocus on GW2, most likely in the form of monetizable content, like build templates and capes.
---
you know, just because you can compete and you do not need to buy shit, doesn't take the argument away.  
---
take two people which never played gw2 and one straight up buys with gems to gold all stuff to craft asc. gear and can play level 100 fractals after 4 days if he wants vs the other dude which has to play at least 1 or 2 months to do the same, then the dude who bought himself out simply had a adventage over the other player.   
---
having a advantage over someone in time means: pay 2 win.  
---
yes you do not need to do that.  
---
yes, the other player will maybe catch up.  
---
yes, either could be better then the other player.   
---
BUT yes the one who bought stuff with real money had the time adventage and at this spot you did pay to win.  
---
discussion end.  
---
btw. most players which "pay to win" the game have 30+ accounts and collect dailys for laurels / mystic coins, they do not care about  some 10s item in the shop....just saying.
---
Because its more popular to bash Arena Net and attribute all of the negatives to them instead of considering the possibility that there are malicious things going on behind the scenes.
---
Most picks will do 4
---
I don't know, this might fall under rule 1. Experiencing the cutscene this way definitely gives me an advantage. ;)
---
/u/khorren and /u/Treize_XIII i appreciate seeing you like the work and the promotion, update to the website coming soon.
---
Spot on
---
What. Didn't they add a raid last year?
---
Another thing to note is that it currently does not let you join an LFG squad without a commander.
---
So if a commander leaves, if the squad is on LFG, you can't join via the window again until someone tags up.
---
Disabling auto targeting can be quite important even though it may not be the most convenient before being used to it, as well as free camera in order to use dash attacks without targeting an enemy, and also to use your backwards dashes in the reverse direction (by turning your character in the other side (X by default) without moving the camera (free camera) then returning your character again)
---
It's also convinient to not auto target if you want to blast stealth (pistol thief) without aggroing ennemies, etc
---
Mainly I'd say : bind the closest target and try to play without auto target, as it allows you way more than you can do with it
---
thanks for the tip. looking into it now.
---
ooo.... thief batman. Also good idea.
---
I think I might. I will check it out. I wanna see funerary mask without the beard. I really like that it shows the chin, which feels close to batman's cowl.
---
I love it.
---
Ugh, still trying to get a quetzal feather for Bo...
---
a 5 man instance that you can afk auto attack, yes.
---
I'd add that raids as well are not hard in gw2 compared to other games, so you may want to try them when you feel more confident with your friend as well. The hardest is to find people to play with, start with a guild, don't pug
---
The main goal should be your first ascended armor but know that the exotic gear is enough for everything but fractals (due to AR). As for the mounts, it's a bliss to have them so I'd recommend to get them when you hit level 80. The only thing that would spoil you is the name of the bad guy of PoF, not what happened before (for the first mission)
---
Fractals are really progressing content as you should have no difficulty at all for t1 / t2. In my opinion, t3 is the bad guy because people that do them are people that can't handle t4, which is not a good omen. Here again, try to play with friends as it will remove a lot of toxicity
---
&gt; Thats pitiful
---
Your approach to farming is, yes, it is. Maybe work on that. :/
---
A couple skins, judging from ones of the pics.
---
I want sweater warclaw! üòÅ
---
1. Karma farming, for those like myself who buy all the LW minis, tonics, etc.
---
2. Achievements, including repeatable achievements - up to and including the 20 year achievement, so AP hunters always have at least one thing to aim for.
---
3. For those not interested in gambling, farming wintersday gifts to sell on the TP.
---
4. Most importantly, a wide variety of activity that is only available for 3 weeks; at least *one* of these would be enjoyable for any one person. Thus: Just doing stuff for the enjoyment of the content itself.
---
If you seek profit, there's something to do. If you seek AP, there's something to do. If you enjoy gambling, there's something to do. If you seek enjoyment from content, there's plenty to do.
---
These items are such a scam. Idiot trap and literally just deleting your gold.
---
So how do you farm? Do a hundred events a day? You cant possibly rack up a million karmabjust from kills alpne
---
Yeah volatile tools are slower. Someone did the math in the past. Maybe you can find the reddit post from googling if you‚Äôre interested in the actual numbers.
---
I kind of figured it was that way since you load in all the assets for the cinematic, showing that none of it was pre-rendered. Makes me wonder how the non-cinematic viewer sees the play. Is Joko and Aurene there for everyone?
---
Harry Potter called and said he wants his font back.
---
So i have a bad mindset because i use mounts???
---
Or is it because i don't agree with you?
---
Man some people are borderline delusional...
---
Nice - although I ain't touchin' Taco. Isn't that technically considered 3rd party software these days? Or is that just what botters accuse for getting themselves banned?
---
Nah, Tac0 is a valid source to use. Devs have stated it does not go against ToS and cannot get you banned
---
If you read my previous statement means... I'm only commenting and saying the experience I had, Im not pushing anything on to anyone LOL, why are you so aggressive man. And if you meant the title. Its more like a suggestion for new players. I love helping new players and all veteran players do say skip this and that. I do agree that atleast a Raptor would be nice but it still takes away so much. But feel free to do so, though try exploring to rather than most player just wanting that POI for completion. And idk why you mean exploring = not using mount. I use mount, if you read the last line of the title also. It's an experience you will never get again. And if you read some other comments of players who played Hot at release they know what I meant. I ain't pushing anything. Pushing is telling them to do this, it's more like a conversation and telling my experience on that comment you are attacking. Calm down man. You can play the game as you want if that's what you like
---
Good to know - cheers!
---
It's been open quite a few times, especially after cookie quit.
---
I tend to do the same thing, how many ectos per exotic di you get? Atm i forge and sell the bad ones that come out of that...
---
The Jahai Bluffs Ancestor Tree story.
---
that's exacly what I mean
---
It will change when they will add heroes
---
salvage o matic, unbreakable harvesting tools, and doesnt pof ultimate come with a passkey?
---
110% yes...do. I just have a weird obsession with looking good immediately in games...it's totally irrational, lol.
---
&gt; That's 90 globs converted to 90g+ with just that one insignia.
---
I think you forgot to subtract out the tax which takes the total sale net to around the crafting cost.  (At the time of this comment, it was ~60s profit per insignia sold instant if you crafted/bought cheapest).
---
What are QoL skills?
---
Best quality-of-life improvement: Copper-Fed Salvage-O-Matic
---
Account-wide improving upgrades: Bank tabs, character slots, shared inventory slots
---
New maps, story missions, and other rewards: Living World seasons 2, 3, and 4.
---
A pricey but nice luxury: a set of unbreakable gathering tools
---
Also, we're a week out from the Wintersday festival and that historically has meant daily sales in the gem store. You'll probably get more for your money if you hold off right now and wait to see if some of the stuff you want goes on sale.
---
Yes.
---
"What it did it cost ?"
---
"A layoff"
---
I know that you've put time and effort into your look but...I don't like the color scheme.
---
Bioluminessence, pre HoT. It was my very first collection that i actually invest myself in. I have no idea how it works and i didnt know dulfy yet, so i ask the map chat everytime i hit a dead end and everyone, most of em were very friendly. Sometimes it turns into a stand up comedy, a barren chat, and even group up with strangers where i had fun for hours to finish the challenging mote story using Caith.
---
The Mist Armor? The Revenant armor set when HoT was just released. I spend days farming Chak Gerent, figuring out how to do the meta correctly and that feeling when you finally did it is just wow! Everyone showing off the headband for a screenshot before disappearing one by one, never to be seen again is sad and great memories at the same time.
---
Least favorite was Nevermore. Ugh, the bug that prevent the event was horrible. But had fun with the community while waiting with other 10 players.
---
Uh I sense some anger here. I'm sorry I was at work so I didnt have a chance to do something you can do with Google. I suggest you google trade caches, trade keys, pact supply network scouting materials, buying cheap karma gear salvaging them etc etc. I'm sorry you think it's a "bother" but they are plenty of says to use it. I'm sorry you are just too lazy to use it.
---
Can't wait to crash the price for presents on the TP!
---
I actually prefer the new format. Players concentrate on a single LW3/LW4 map, instead of scattering between all 6 maps.
---
Not even i know what to say to this.
---
what is the music
---
&gt; why not? 
---
Because another mini would be about as useful as 100 stacks of Dark Matter.  How about being able to trade in 1000 for a mystic coin, or a 24 slot bag, a guild hall decoration, an exisiting weapon collection re-skinned in a different color, or Canach's backpack?
---
tricks; preparations; stealth. sounds pretty spot on.
---
&gt;But my interpretation of your previous comment was: "All rewards are not available through gameplay? That's sad."
---
Then your interpretation is incorrect. My comment quite clearly said: "It's sad to me that so many **categories** of skins **are either wholly, or largely, exclusive to microtransactions**."
---
&gt;These are parts of free DLC updates, not the base game or paid expansions
---
I don't think something qualifies as "free" if you have to own (i.e. buy) a product to gain access to it. If I told you, "you can have this for free, but you'll have to buy this other thing first", would you consider it to be free? I wouldn't, I'd consider it included in the purchase. But LW episodes aren't really included either, because they're only "free" for a limited time. This system lets ArenaNet have their cake and eat it too; it lets them pretend to their established player base that they're giving away something for "free" while still charging new players, when what they're really offering is a time-limited inclusive with additional caveats (you have to log in to claim it, which is of course also a tactic to keep player retention up, but more on that below).
---
So yeah, I definitely think ArenaNet **wants you to think** it is free, but they're not releasing content out of the kindness in their hearts, are they? The express purpose of releasing content is keeping people invested in their game and thereby exposing them to opportunities to spend money on microtransactions. That's the business model. So yes, in a sense, buying "lots of QoL stuff" is what's paying for the "free" content, because nothing is actually free.
---
thanks for the headphone warning hoss
---
*nervously sweats*
---
Last year I got 45 stacks of presents solely from the JP and this year... *laughs maniacally*
---
Keanu Weaves a web of lies.
---
I've already bought the max you can have... And I'd buy more.
---
Okay I asked around without any clear answer please help me. Are Recs worth doing ? ONLY gold wise. Not the pots or relics. And if so does anyone know how much? 
---
When we say t4 warm around 15-20g is that including recs or just the t4? Cuz I notice if I do t have time I just do 30min t4s and afraid of missing out on gold.
---
*my bags constantly letting out a faint, high pitched squealing noise 24/7*
---
Nah, its perfectly normal to have 200 slots and only ever have 10 slots free....
---
Right?...
---
*Right????*
---
But it's all better again at the end!.... Right?
---
One of my guildies recently spotted a Sylvari named Miley Cypress.

---
1. Maybe if you don't unlock everything you can with karma, sure. I've been playing fairly constantly since 2012 and I still haven't finished unlocking the Tier 3 cultural weapon skins (will with this Wintersday though). And I know I'm not the only one.
---
2. There are AP hunters though, and though there could be more AP to get, there's enough to keep people occupied for a mere 3 weeks.
---
3/4. I don't think these go hand-in-hand, since people interested in 3 would target the most efficient farm routes, while those just enjoying the content would go to whatever they want to do. That said, content does **NOT** need to be new to be enjoyable, and if you believe that it must be brand shiny new to be fun, I feel sorry for you.
---
&gt; Most of us farmed Winter's Presence in the first year til our brains were numb
---
Well, that's kind of your own fault, ain't it?
---
Thank you
---
i havent updated/logged into this toon since the cape update, will remove the bat wings for a cape soon, i might also get rid of the overcoat for that matter
---
but he is named "BatAsura" :)
---
That got a snort, thanks for posting.
---
How about for a change, I'll let you what really isn't worth getting:
---
black lion keys, backpack with no real effects, cookie cutter outfits, gliders, mount skin rng unless the chances are 15%+, chairs, home instance nodes, skinned gathering tools that is more animation than speed, wait out on capes for better ones to come out, package deals for "exclusive" junk, don't get more than one express lounges.
---
All of the above, you get via grinding gold - gem conversion. Late game.
---
He's level 51, so no weaver access yet
---
Thank you for your kind reply. I do hope someone knows the good amount so I can see if it‚Äôs worth doing
---
Ah yes, one of those.
---
I once came across a thief named Thieven Stealberg.
---
GW2Taco site seems to be down at time of posting :(
---
Trust me man. I defended this game since it was released. I know what it's like. You'll realize eventually.
---
I actually sprung for Rox's Pathfinder outfit purely because it looks decent across a wide range of classes/races and has stopped me from spending a lot of other resources unlocking other armor skins.
---
Probably anything sub 40silver. Wouldn't waste scholar runes on a minion build. Just pick your favourite meme rune.
---
I CAN say I have blamed a death on ping in PvP but generally I'm all right there. That said, im nkt sure how much betger i would be if i had better ping so perhaps its not possible to judge.
---
I honestly can't say I ever noticed a problem in PvE until I tried to do "the floor is lava" challenge in HoT and realised it simply wasn't possible to earn gold. I'm not aware of dying from bad ping but it might be possible. Perhaps I would have dodged that half a second sooner or my heal would have gone off after input and prevent a death.
---
i play reaper with my sydney 290 ping. i dont play much competitive group content though.
---
Start learning lfgs during the weekend. Once you get some exp you can pug no kp lfgs. CMs aren‚Äôt that hard once you get a hang of it. They feel like regular T4 to me now while regular T4 feels like T2 (I‚Äôm able to solo bosses when the situation requires it), just to give an idea.
---
Doing daily t4 + cm fractals is decent gold, and farming lvl 96 or 42(or another lvl of aetherblade/mai trin) is one of the best farms in the game for gold, spirit shards and karma. You'll definitely need to have a group of good players with decent coordination for that tho.
---
Yes, well, I've criticized this game since Season 2, as a fan who's played GW1 since 2006. Or praised when they did well.
---
I do know what it's like.
---
And the simple fact of the matter is that holiday content doesn't need constant new content to be enjoyable to folks. Things do not need to be new or first time experienced to be enjoyable - and this goes beyond GW2, beyond video games even.
---
If it isn't something you enjoy - that's fine. Nothing will be fulfilling to all people. And that must be acknowledged. But no temporary annual content should be so bloated as to attempt to have stuff enjoyable to all people all the time. Especially when there are people stuck in the mindset that experiencing for the second time ever, or for the first after a year of not experiencing, is boring.
---
Usually chairs don't work outside Major Cities.
---
Aaaaah ok :). I do the same haha. Take my time. Do all the optional dialogue. Etc.
---
How about Marjory? She was finally back in this one after basically phasing out throughout season 3.
---
I think those kind of missions are extremely rare and the worst case have is a few instances of a few episodes of the Living Story where either people in your group are not very useful (they are a kind of a wisp that can help you a bit with some unique skills (like heal you, recharge some skills, etc) but not directly fight or do the main action. And there are also a few missions where you can only get some achivements if you are the instance owner (not sure if they changed that) so if you are after achievements with your firend you may need to redo a specific instace as many times as you have people playing with you.
---
I love the Grove and I might just leave the game if they take away the place where I was born into GW2 with and replace it with another boring slab of a concrete jungle, but this is a well-crafted comment.
---
You were right, it drops all sorts of gems, including t6 (but not ONLY t6 reeee). Interesting that my old packages from the board, also contain jewels now.
---
disagree
---
Aurene should have stayed dead imo, if only for the story to have any meaning and growth. There haven't been consequences in this game since Claw Island.
---
Do us all a favor and make a jump-by-jump video guide for these? Took me way too long to beat the Clocktower JP my first time (nearly the entire event)
---
Making them into different hubs was the only thing that spares us the pain of what they've done to LA.
---
The thing is the amount of exotics have a supply limit and eventually run out.  Being able to do 200 each day can't be sustained indefinitely.  Even Using https://gw2.silveress.ie/extracting  to determine upgrade value vs the price of exotics.. and then factoring in the chance of ectos dropping, there isn't very many exotics to pick from.
---
And this is why people rush the episodes. Because of the fear nobody will do it anymore after a few weeks.
---
7-10g from T4 daily.
---
And 0-5g profit from recs, depends on how do you earn keys (best source is for Integrated Fractal Matrixes). If you buy the keys for 20s, you will very poor profit. If you buy them for regular matrixes, you won't make profit. Recs are good if you're doing CMs. I wouldn't waste time for recs without doing CMs.
---
1: his bundle had a passkey.
---
2: "[Mistlock Sanctuary passkey](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Sanctuary_Passkey)" is not available presently.
---
Otherwise, solid recommendations.
---
They planned to extend the sitting to other maps outside of major cities but, that never happened. They just don't think that this is really important.
---
Nah, necro Britney Fears
---
I think one of the few classes that would flex across PvE (Fracs, open world, raids) while also being an A-tier build in WvW would be core warrior. Aussie as well here, use to play Spvp competitively and playing with our ~250 ping isn't that terrible tbh. Core warrior is viable in both fractals and some raid encounters (if raising is also something you do) and also really good for WvW roaming. The major difference would be the utilities taken, which should be different when plating PvE compared to WvW
---
That's no excuse. People rush because people rush. Such is the nature of most. Besides, not like an episode in of itself can last you more than a day, you'd have to be really slow or meticulous, or lazy. Strictly speaking about story content at least. As for map exploration, again, nothing that will take you more than a day to, at least, experience every event.
---
&gt; Because of the fear nobody will do it anymore after a few weeks.
---
Whether it's a short episode or an expansion, this is how MMOs function. It can't be avoided. Sooner or later, maps become less and less populated.
---
are there better ways to convert with 0 time investement tho?
---
p.s. just tested it again, 14g~

---
Hmm, I don't really think it's horizontal progression that really kept this game afloat over the years.
---
I'd argue that that is one of its weakest features. WoW, ESO, and a bunch of other long lived games have vertical progression and they're still alive and running.
---
I'd argue GW 2 survived because it genuinely is a good game despite its shortcomings.
---
Thats it. My next character is going to be a guardian (naturally charr) and I now must find out what disgustingly clever name I must give it
---
What are CMs?
---
It is realy rare. The only one that comes to my mind on the fly is the last boss of the griffon quest line.
---
For amulet and a ring I'd go to Draconic Mons. Fire orchids seem to accumulate faster than blood rubies and petrified wood. You can also park a char from lvl 10 and above at the JP chest there using teleport to friend - it will be getting lvl 80 loot, including some magic and 3 orchids daily. 
---
Alternatively you could get 2 rings from bitterfrost and attune/infuse it, you can wear both at the same time in that case. 
---
For accessory your only option seems to be Ember Bay if you limit yourself to LS3. It can also be bought in WvW, but personally I wouldn't waste skirmish tickets on an accessory.
---
CMs + t4s make the most gold for an hour or so of gameplay, but you'd have to get proficient with your class to do CMs.
---
well,im getting usualy 5 MC from CM,so thats  7G daily just from that. 15G from T4 and CMs shoud give you 8 extra gold.
---
For the amulet, you can farm jade (ep4), orchids (ep5), pearls (ep6).  
---
For the ring, bloodstone &amp; orchids.  
---
For the accessory, only petrified wood is available beside the berries.  
---
Source: [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket#Trinkets_with_selectable_prefixes)  
---
I would suggest checking Tekkit's TacO paths for farming those currencies. Don't forget to participate to most events at least once per day.  
---
Note also that with the recent change to daily LW achievements, farming will be slower in maps that don't have those achievements that day.   
---
There are daily limits on the amount of currency you can farm per day per character, so you'll have to stop at some point and wait for the next day.  
---
Also, I assume you don't have PoF (because of your comment on mounts)? Otherwise, the amulet on the new map (Bjora Marches) is the cheapest to get (it requires finishing an easy collection first), and since Dragonfall is currently the most popular farming map, you'll have no issues farming mistborne motes (but it is a lot easier with mounts, yes).
---
Yeah
---
Are you a free account? Many items can't be sold by free account people. Eg. Black lion chest skins
---
I have evrything, but i am just finishing the personal story. I guess i recieve the mount while i am doing pof?
---
 1
---
The most gold per hour is probably raid selling and tp flipping, but fractals is near the top yeah
---
They are worth because you can do them significantly faster, my group always skips shattered observatory 75 and 25 because there's so much RP and we just cba. We also most of the time skip lowtier cliffside because the scaling for some mechanics in low tiers is just dumb and slows it down. They are probably still worth, we just cba.
---
With **fractal god** a usual run nets you 20-30 **RAW** gold/day. If you would sell all the stuff it depends on rng but can make up to +5-10 gold. If an aetherized skin drops thats like 10-50g plus (extremely rare tho, I got like 10-15 skins during the years).  
---
I usually convert the daily challenge mode  matrices to 20 key + 30 daily key bought on top. If you do recommended too you end up with more inscriptions than you can open so you can sell those too.
---
Without any fractal buff/mastery I think it is not that much but you still progress on ascended stuff + progress towards fractal buffs which will make you more gold.
---
Used to run with a druid named Shaquille O'Heal in raids. Punny names make my day
---
Exactly. Not to mention the chances for you to meet those are quite low. Yet some people just cant stop whining about gemstore exclusive "mah prestige!". Maybe they should remove the gold to gem to make their whine more tasty.
---
Dildo Daggins is still the best.
---
Can Taco also be used with Windows 7?
---
&gt; Horizontal progression game giving too much new content is a problem, mainly for new players, because they find themselves with too much content to play
---
I'd never thought I'd see this one. "There's too much content, it's bad". Are you high or something?
---
QoL = Quality of Life. Stuff that makes playing more convenient.
---
It should
---
Nah 700 gems Item
---
OK boomer
---
I had the exact same problem a few months ago. GW2 took up 98-100% of my cpu. (i5-4690) I tried re√Ønstalling the game 2 times and checked other games that theoretically should be more stressfull on my cpu than GW2. Obviously that didn't give me an answer. And when I acctually wanted to quit the game entirely (especially raids are unplayable if you can not react to things) a guildie told me of d912pxy.  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dkl02z/d912pxy\_dx12\_for\_gw2\_now\_v19/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dkl02z/d912pxy_dx12_for_gw2_now_v19/)   
---
this is the latest version I could find that has a reddit post. I personally don't exactly know what it does and how it works, so maybe someone here has a good explanation, but my guildie explained that it could fix the problem and it did. Just make sure that you change the filenames if you are using other add-ons like Arcdps/GW2radial/Reshade and I think also Taco, but it gives information about that.
---
For the amulet. IMO, that fastest one to get now is the one from Bjora Marches. Could easily get multiple amulets in a day with enough toons
---
I average about 18g a day  for an hour‚Äôs with of play time. And it‚Äôs actually fun
---
But only after paying almost 10 bucks for it
---
Crafting ascended weapons is easy(tho expensive). Just buy the recipe, get the mats and craft.  
---
The process you described is for legendary weapons lol.
---
The very first mission gives you the raptor, you have to buy the next 3, and complete (lengthy &amp; expensive) collections for the rest.
---
I think your 4th point is the most important one, there is a wide variety of activities. So unless a player don't like to do the same content again there is at least one activity for every player with Wintersday. I like to ring bells, play with (or destroy) toys, throw snow balls to other players and race on a Raptor so there is a lot for me to do. And the Wintersday JP is doable even with my old reflexes so I can do that a few times every year too. Wintersday is my favourite holiday in GW 2.
---
Keys cost 6 g and yes it cuts into profits but you definitely come out out on top and I value the integrated matrices than those keys
---
Plus you save alot of gold by getting ASC gear
---
So  a jumping mount for mistborne motes is hard to get?
---
I saw that one wiki. Seemed easy to get. Is that true?
---
The Bonus Mission Pack was created after Guild Wars 1 stopped active development and was first given away as a gift if you spent enough in the in-game shop.
---
It was really intended to be the last new content in GW1, before the Live Team went ahead and created the War in Kryta, Hearts of the North and Winds of Change, which was created by a tiny team.  
---
Those last 3 releases could be seen as living world and were completely free.
---
So the reason for the Bonus Mission Pack was completely different and I don't see them doing this. It's a great format to tell some last-minute stories when you're working on something new and to expand your lore, but for a live game that's still getting new content I'd rather see them focussing on bringing new story.
---
when i played the game back then, raids seemed to mostly take people on ascended gear or with a insane amount of success points, so i'm not even sure i'll be even taken, but i'll try.
---
Thank for your help, time to find a guild.
---
Bloodstone rubies are ok now, but petrified wood is still a pain in the ass to collect
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
You can have fun with that gravity on mounts in guild hall with fractal console decoration.
---
Yes. I have this feeling too. Most of the upgrades now are gem store items. I doubt the icebrood saga will be a good season. I think they just try to milk some cash (because no expansion will be ever be released in the next 2-3 years) and then let the game die.
---
Basically every group who attempts to go for optimized kills splits they clear 
---
Also the attempt to clear all Wings within a short time comes with some sacrifices to class swaps and therefore with suboptimal comps  ( not saying it wouldn‚Äôt work with swaps but you loose quite a time if not done in the right moment )
---
The idea behind us basically completely different between good kills and good runs 
---
Even tho I would like to see full wing records again :)
---
Map completions and exploration are two different playstyles. When you do map completion it's about getting through a map and finishing it as quickly as possible. TD is your enemy there. When you just explore, well you take your time, explore side areas, ect, for which TD is great.
---
I can't quite put my finger on why, but not writing the word for achievements really makes me mad. I guess it is my problem, not yours, but none the less it is still a thing.
---
And I loved it. I still hold up Tangled Depths as a prime example of a well designed, complex map.
---
Cool! I wish I had a such talent to be able to celebrate birthdays of my characters. Funny thing - almost every character of mine was created on September: two  on Sep 7, 2012, one on  one  Sep 5, 2012 and another one on  Sep 18, 2013. Youngest ones on  Sep 2, Sept 21 and  Nov 30 2019.
---
I think that Springer is a must. It will be very usefull with vistas. Also you'll be able to jump over obstacles instead of riding around.
---
sorry, i'm gen x (sorry again) while i had to learn writing by hand with a pencil long before (25 years) computers became a household item, i very quickly adopted shorthand and net-speak. mmo shortened speech is a thing.
---
Fckn PvE Pleb.
---
This toxicity is why I don't play PvP :)
---
mine is zero too. but i did start my mmo journey in perfect world international on a pvp server (open world pvp) without even knowing what pvp stood for, and thought pvp was a natural thing.
---
i then played a lot of pvp in swtor before i came to gw2. i guess i'm battle weary and havent stepped into this version except for wvw for the battle mount and a few gift of battles for some legendaries.
---
That is the beauty of the map. Theres 50 other maps if you want to sightsee or get map completion done in 15 minutes.
---
Tangled depth is rare treat that actually makes you use your brains a little.
---
You can buy account upgrades and attribute infusions with them.
---
I feel now like in PvP lobby chat.
---
I think they might be in my guild, I'm not entirely sure though. It is at least something close.
---
I just do 1-2 unranked matches a day to get my daily And thats it
---
good old PWi times.. :)
---
Its pretty okay if you have already done Druid Stone collections though. My particular gripe with it was the karma requirement for Lake Doric achievements, had 0 at the time
---
Yeah I feel like the legendary collections are actually enjoyable if you have the gold beforehand.
---
yes there is, hot is now bundled with pof.  I figured it would be like blizzard who most likely does not honor old expansions because all old ones are free and already registered to your account by default.
---
rip my chrono,that baby cost me 5k gold and now shes guarding character select screen :(
---
plenty of reasons: 
---
* *this is the same company that just broke an addon to sell a worse version of the same feature on the gem store.* 
---
*  *hot is now bundled with pof.  I figured it would be like blizzard who  most likely does not honor old expansions because all old ones are free  and already registered to your account by default.*

---
yes
---
Yeah, it's me again. I promise that I'll eventually stop asking every question that comes to my mind :p. For now, though, which class should I play?
---
Only Guardian and Warrior are in question, since I want heavy armour skins (phalanx armour, mmm, delightful), and Revenant's whole deal won't fit my new character RP-wise. I'm leaning towards Guardian due to the paladin vibe they have, but Warrior is fine too.
---
I would like a class that offers an open world/dungeon/fractal build (I mean, a fractal build is fine for open world too, right? I don't aim at being super good at the game, so some mediocre losses in efficiency don't matter to me one bit) that has good dps, doesn't rely on combos too much (can't be arsed to learn those) and, most importantly, doesn't require the usage of just one weapon, because that is boring (but also does not require non-stop switching, because that is tiring). If you think that I am too picky, yeah, I may be: being unable to find the combat playstyle that really rings with me was one of reasons I left the game years ago.
---
After taking a look at the build's list, these are the kind I am most interested in:

Charruman, it's genius. I'm laughing on it more than I should.
---
Oh look, the daily gaem ded thread.
---
shhhhhhh.
---
This ^
---
It is not even comparable to how it was in early 2000
---
They never will. The community gives them zero incentive to do so when they trip over themselves to buy them like hotcakes every time a new one is put out.
---
You think the charr tail clipping is bad now...
---
Same
---
How do you make the Group Buff time left visible in the top left ?
---
I can relate. 14.000 hours of gameplay, and I don't play PvP or will ever do it.
---
&gt; Is this a bug?
---
Nope. MM is just stupidly overpowered in PvE. MM is also by far the easiest way to cheese Mordremoth in the final story step of HoT.
---
Funny that I facerolled almost all mobs in PoF maps yesterday without(!) Reaper (my warrior can't do it).
---
But I didn't tried very hard bosses, so mb vampirism?
---
1 character, 1 map instance. I added it in the parent comment
---
You don't need attribute infusions or augmentations . I run CM's daily - you need minimum 150 AR , all the large fractal potions and then a squad that's patient , then just go in and learn the fights . Unfortunately finding squads is difficult because people ask for like 100+ kill proof . 
---
Id advise looking for or putting together a training static with maybe one person who knows the fight for teaching , then jump right in . Further than that good luck :3
---
The only way people would move on to a GW3 is if it was like Overwatch 2: New engine, improved art and features, but all previous content still playable.
---
There's no freaking way they'd revamp the whole game to say they made a GW3. They won't freaking update old maps with new features, with very few punctual exceptions, and you expect them to renew the entire game?
---
thank you ! look like most of the builds are good just for a little part of the content, urgh... don't see myself juggling with 5 differents sets to be honest.
---
Thank you a lot for your patience
---
if you run scepter, stm and chaos it's super pointless to have diviner gear as your dps will be potato anyway
---
i'm pretty sure stm can keep quickness by itself(without much bd either), there's no reason for this abomination of a build
---
no idea why you're implying there is only minmax dps diviner mix or full memestrel either! you can totally run a 1.4k toughness diviner/commander/knights/whatever mix
---
War (power berserker) runs axe/axe. You can put them in two different load outs to let you swap (and proc swap traits) but usually you run with mace/mace or nothing/mace for extra CC. The ‚Äúrotation‚Äù on power berserker is really simple in that you use your primal burst (F1) as much as possible. It has no cool down if you hit with it so you just need the adrenaline to cast it which is 3 hits, some combo of your axe skills or a weapon swap if running just axe. Also if running the DPS version and not banners you just stay berserk and keep killing things.
---
I think it is a next iteration of this guy https://old.reddit.com/user/Nijal73  https://old.reddit.com/user/Driestu Dunno what he is trying to achieve, I think we got our resident insane person.
---
i'd go with dps chrono, specifically illusions version! no, domi is not "the same damage" when solo like many claim..you sacrifice like 70% self-quickness, which is a huge loss
---
likewise, don't go boon support in open world! turning that 1.5k dps into 2k won't change much! you can still buff people with timewarp at world bosses because let's be real, nobody will stand in your wells
---
I admit I'm not entirely up to date on warrior and this just axe/axe thing is new to me.
---
bitterfrost and dragonfall imo. additionally, convert eternal ice shards/use them for the amulet
---
They used to be [Town Clothing](https://youtu.be/UmrK8SLSks4).
---
They merged them into outfits because making them split was too much work. Basically like having a 4th armor class.
---
What they should do is making them work like GW1's [Costumes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Outfit), having separate hat and body, because they already have to make the outfit versions without the hat for personal story cinematics, so all that's left is adding the slot for hats, separate hats, and letting people toggle hats on and off, so people can freely combine hats, outfits, helmets and the rest of the armor.
---
These builds are designed to serve their role in PvE, for DPS builds they want to do as much damage as they can with the group so weapons that don‚Äôt deal good damage are not taken. For open world you can always pretty much do whatever you want. As for the listings on snowcrows, unless you‚Äôre playing a support, the best DPS for each boss changes and some fights prefer power DPS while others may be better with condition damage. There really isn‚Äôt a single DPS build that is ‚Äúmeta‚Äù everywhere. That being said though almost every fight wants a banner warrior (power or condi), almost every fight wants a Druid, almost every fight wants chrono and/or firebrand/renegade for boons. Lots of common builds and honestly a lot of non-meta builds that are just fine in a lot more places than SC will list. Were you looking at running the berserker power build?
---
They just forget to keep doing things they did before.
---
Looks like nobody ever bothered making a list of 'standards' to keep in new maps. Some maps will have it, some maps won't.
---
Wow. Ty vm for all the info
---
I made a charr engineer named Linus Furvalds thinking I was really smart and funny. No one ever commented on it.
---
That sounds good - because it's simple - and also bad - because it is boring. Would prefer something a bit more interesting while still relatively simple. Preferably something that wouldn't have me use one and the same kind of weapon for hundreds of hours too.
---
Which is why I begun by saying you join your world's WvW guild. There will be players online giving credit along side you if you aren't on a tiny server. This is most easily done with WvW rank, but if you pop the others you stand a good chance of getting them too. I frequently log out and when I log back in I have "Capture and Hold" bouncy chest waiting for me.

Have you tried Xx Darth Naruto Legless Xx
---
Here to help!
---
Yes, the mmo genre is smaller than it used to a decade ago, but it didnt change much over the last couple of years. So what does that have to do with anything? Gw2 didnt even exist back then.
---
A recent decline in population in an mmo right now has nothing to do with mmos being a "dying genre", otherwise successful mmos like ff14 wouldnt keep growing.
---
It's a Dragonhunter. The focus is just showing despite not being equipped
---
I was still sleepy when I read the title so I got all excited about new specs.... then I died a little inside :D
---
I wonder if they will ever add it to black lion chests. I don't really wanna spend 1000 gems on the tools. But then again the glyph alone will probably cost that much in gold on the TP anyway.
---
well genius tell me then why both forums are filled with complains about how short the story is, or how boring the new map, or why it has no replayability...
---
naah wait, i know you will say some trashy thing like "because forums are filled with trolls who want the game to go down with no reason whatsoever" like any other white knight working for anet for free so don't even bother
---
you have your opinion i got mine, we won't reach a meeting point so lets drop it...
---
Oh man, I can get armor that has +5 more power than before, I am so hyped
---
TacO was even promoted on official GW2 twitter from what I heard. (To be taken with a grain of salt, I don't use twitter).
---
I've personally used TacO for years and never gotten any issues. I can't farm orphans without it anymore. It's not the most time efficient route but it's mindless enough to listen to a podcast or something while doing it, and that's miles less boring than having to stay focused to find my way around and keep run times down.
---
I know that feeling, it's nice to always have skills on hand. 
---
You can also mix some elixirs (stability or swiftness might be handy in some occasions), use rifle turret (low-cooldown toolbelt skill for damage), or maybe some gadget (I'm not too fond of them, but Battering Ram is a good CC, and the boots are useful when you can't mount). But you should always have at least one kit. 
---
Later on with Holosmith you can actually drop kits, Photon Forge is a kit by itself (though with a timer and cooldown) and the Exceed skills are good. Or you can just add it to your kit arsenal. I'm not familiar with Scrapper since I like Holosmith so much :P
---
\&gt; *Every single MMO* recycles holiday events and rarely, if ever, update anything about them. 
---
Both Runescape 3 and Oldschool Runescape have unique holiday event for all holidays every year, and seen other MMOS as well always add something new juicy to it. Adding extra layer on already established event isnt that hard. You could make extra extreme JP path within 10 minutes.
---
great to see others do that on a time basis! how long do you think are w1 and w7 pre combined? 2:40 h is still fast!
---
on the speedclear category: just add one to [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com) for "10 man full clear w1-w7"
---
not sure if it is viable for competition since the total time is rather long. on the other hand there are games like baseball so why not give it a try?
---
the fastest weekly fc i did was 3:04 h including all events and roleplay talk or rejoin moves. check this run every week: [https://www.twitch.tv/m4nkel/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/m4nkel/videos)
---
That is me. After Summer shatter changes and every other nerf, I havent touched my chrono for once. They just went full butcher on it instead of balance changes. It felt really rewarding to play proper rotation while also maintaining tanking and dodging. Now its just spamming buttons.
---
Because forum are filled with nolifer trolls
---
To be fair, since you said you're not trying to be as efficient as possible I don't really see why you would need to stay in Axe/Axe on a power berserker. Yes, DPS wise it is the most optimal thing you can do but if you swap to greatsword for flavor (and oh boy, the berserker GS burst skill is spicy) you wouldn't really have a bad build on your hands either.
---
Alright so karma?   
---
I found people saying that fastest way to farm karma is stuff like karmic retribution where you get liek 10k karma/hour  
---
so what do y'all do having 10m karma? What'S the secret behind the wintersday karma farm?
---
Played from launch to early 2015, only started up again about a week ago. I miss the giant zerg battles where sides were actually relatively evenly matched and the battle would go on for a while with people using revive orbs and such to get back into it. I also miss the Mesmer portal chains into the SMC throne room and taking it without breaking down any walls/gates. Those were some of my fondest memories.

PvP is real endgame of GW2.

Really this white knight stuff is boring
---
We have different opinion  is not like you work for anet is u think game is good
---
And actually game is really good from my point of view . One week to wintersaday anyway
---
Apologies, and thanks for the help. Got it figured out :)
---
This was definitely it, thank you!
---
That was it. Thanks :)
---
Ok, that's understandable. It will be my second Wintersday this year so I didn't notice this. 
---
However, I've read somewhere that they would probably release it on December 10th so I was a little bit disappointed that we'll have to wait till next week.
---
Not many players are able to reach it
---
Pepehands
---
Alternatively, we can play games built from the ground up and supported as pvp games and play an mmorpg as an mmorpg.
---
Silk Scraps you just gotta buy or farm any kind of mat farm. Fractals, any other pve etc.
---
for obsidian shards karma is your best bet. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley-Energy_Matter_Converter gives daily almost always obi
---
You can buy shards with karma.
---
Obsidian shards easiest method is farming winterberrys for unbound magic and buying them
---
Or silverwastes chest farm, which should be getting more popular again after the new map dies down 
---
Silk scraps you get plenty from salvaging green and blue unidentified gear that you come across, currently getting a s**t tonne from the chests in bjora
---
You two are just discussing feelings though. Better items for money is p2w. Insignificant time saved is not. Anything in between is a gray area where it depends on the person if something is p2w.
---
Well, you you looked at the F buttons, you wouldn't ask the question.
---
Oh my god its perfect
---
Next week is wintersday so a perfect time to get some more karma
---
Obviously dragon hunter. He has traps and spear of justice. Neither firebrand nor new spec will have access to these skills.
---
First thing to get is copper fed salvage o matic.
---
I got that with my first gems and I literally use it every single time I play gw2.
---
Throw it in your first shared slot and forget to ever move it.
---
It's the most important thing to get with gems IMO.
---
Just save up till you can get it, the rest is fluff, but that will make your time so much easier and less stressful with sorting your inventory.
---
I've got that one reserved on a bank alt, gonna sell it when we get playable Krait
---
What about with the sword variant he mentions? Correct me if I'm wrong, but with the sword variant you have almost no build differences between that and normal boon chrono.
---
Edna Mode is so disappointed in the gw2 community right now...
---
Do raids, there you get a lot of bags containing silk, and you also get karma from Wich you can buy shards in Orr
---
Silk drops from absolutely everything. I get a stack of that stuff in no time by doing anything really. Just salvage all the green and blue stuff you get and you will have all mats pretty much.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

FB or Rev for t4 Fractal runs?
---
I have two full sets of heavy armor, one harriers and one diviners/zerk mix for running either a quickbrand or an alacrity Renegade through my daily guild/PUG t4 runs. Which one would be preferred for a random PUG group? FB seem to be the more populated profession, LFG usually already has one or two in parties when I check...so maybe the Ren would be better? Can't make a decision, I keep going back and forth. I can either heal or support on both, but the FB I can also swap to dps DH if neither is needed...dps Rev doesn't seem to be something brought. Any advice on what I should focus on?
---
WvW is great. PvP is trash.
---
Last time I did some PvP was in 2014. I played few games back then. My rank is 12 and I have played since realise and currently at 
---
6,184h 52m.
---
I in general don't like PvP, WvW is ok, but small scale is not my thing. PvE is just so much more fun to me.
---
Uhhh the US fought a war to take Texas/California from Mexico.
---
What about Ritualist from GW?
---
The entire GW franchise is built on horizontal progression. GW1 *and* GW2.
---
There may be points GW2 could improve upon. But Horizontal Progression as as system is not to blame.
---
&gt;Put same content into game with vertical progression and you will see that everyone will be hyped there.
---
The introduction of Ascended Gear singlehandedly killed momentum for this game after release. Granted, in 2019 Ascended Gear isn't as bad today as we thought they would be back then, and the whole system has since been improvoed massively. But that does not change the fact vertical progression is a very BAD thing for this playerbase.  
---
To really make the point how much vertical progression does not work for GW2, infusions that increase stats are so little hyped that nobody except the absolute minmaxers give a shit about that +45 Power.
---
**The point is GW players, whether GW1, or GW2, do not want vertical progression and gear treadmills. They  want horizontal progression, and more build options to choose from.**
---
it fits a lot better with the Norn and their culture tbh
---
of course, im sure there are tons of people that are so bored they get into a game's forum and start speaking trash with absolutely no reason whatsoever... lmao
---
i'd bet they don't even play mmos, but they have fun anyway... my god
---
I got 13 obby shards from the converter at reset yesterday.
---
Its obtainable the whole year thru the collection/achievement isn't it ? I got mine in September accidentally by opening a end chest of some random JP.
---
Done.   
---
I think your promise is a bit flawed.   
---
The way people tend to create characters is either escapist (which then can be broken into cultures and whatnot, basically it's about evening out shortcomings from your real life) or a true gamer, who just want to look at that light t3 human female meta ass or whatever else your fetishes are.
---
Considering past precedent, half the elite specs will be completely unrelated to the expansion.
---
Anyway here are my own ideas:
---
**Revenant**: Shaman - Greatsword
---
New Legend: Bear.
---
Lore: Norn have long called upon the power of Bear to aid them in their hunts. However, in modern Tyria, Norn transformations have become far less frequent. Shamans recall the rituals of old, and tap into the art of transformation.
---
Mechanic: Your F2 skill is now replaced with Transform. (1/4s cast time, -6 Energy Maintained). While maintaining Transform, assume the appearance of your currently attuned legend. Your weapon skills are replaced with transformation skills. (Essentially functioning like Engineer weapon kits.)
---
lets see, you miss:
---
*A ton of stats because this build is super overloaded on concentration, which makes it "easiest" but in reality its barely usefull.
---
*Dueling, which can be taken according to his video, but with sword mainhand it's just a must-have
---
*chronophantasma, your illusions(which is a big part of your damage) just deal 50% of their damage because of this
---

Do you use any special builds like gs mirage and sb DD? Or is it the average open world autoattack build?

Just some advice before you get too many responses. If this is for school I would consider rewriting some answer selections. For example, you asked how often I might change my appearance. There is no option for "Frequently" or equivalent, it goes from "Occasionally" to "I have more wardrobe choices in game than in real life." The latter is meant to be the equivalent of frequently but it sacrifices precision for a light-hearted, fun answer.  
---
  
---
Collecting data that actually reflects the reality of individuals' habits and motivations is challenging enough with perfectly worded questions, don't make it harder for yourself to interpret this data and reduce its validity by making choices like this. Make your questions and answers concise, use straight forward language, and choose wording carefully so as to reduce the responder's need to interpret what the intent behind the question is in order to provide an accurate answer.

I've seen that name in albion online..  youtuber iirc
---
Should've gone with "Felinus Torvalds"
---
I mean, for speedruns, 2-3 hours isn't all that long. Look at runs like Hollow Knight 106%, or Metroid Prime 21%
---
Less supply of them. Before you would get mystic coins a lot. When I came back I had almost near max coins. Sold all those for like 230 some gold. Before HoT that would have been like not even 10g I think. They were only worth some silver then.

maybe what you call trolling is actually giving their opinion on stuff that prevents them from coming back, but i can see you don't even take the time to read em so who cares right?
---
maybe what u call whiteknight is you giving your opinion on the game that is actually ok as it is ? .
---
I just stuck with the character as a main and swapped to mirage. Nowhere near as fun, but hey... it still has *some* of the enjoyment there.
---
selfish ? again : anet decided to switch target from stupid ungrateful ever unhappy raiders to casuals who, guess, are great part of the playerbase since we all know from thousands of post about  "we need more raiders , how to join raid, plz we are not toxic".
---
it is not kicking it is just deciding a different path. when u will grow up you will discover that sometimes in life ppl who are close take different paths . sometimes they walk togheter sometimes they move away.
---
i'm sorry this no more a raiding game (if it ever was) . it' s not being a whiteknight or a selfish . i just enjoy how the game is and i am sorry i do not care about raids . 
---
is it cleared now ?
---
The problem is like 95% of people don‚Äôt put two and two together and realize that you need the red special action skill from fallen creatures to CC this dude. No cooldown necessary. If even just a few people attacking him have that then he‚Äôs easy to CC.
---
Nice.
---
Sounds like what a loyal neutral would do. When you loose your home, you get ready to do some shady shit to get it back or get revenge. That applies to Ascalon Survivors as well as the heroes of Nightfall.
---
Pro? =_=
---
I hope you are joking. Each conversion requires a Mystic Coin.
---
They fixed that a while ago
---
Nice
---
maybe, maybe we are all just trolls who don't even play gw2, just have fun trashing some random game on reddit lmao
---
just the fact you say the game is ok as it is tells me all i need to know to leave this discussion
---
have a good afternoon
---
Healer specs are also meta in WvW, especially in zergs. I run a Minstrel Tempest Auramancer-Midline-heal build, switching between air and earth as needed. Runes of the monk or of the trooper seem to be the most popular, I use the former and a guildie uses the latter, so I end up healing a bit more while she focuses on condi clears.
---
Yea, totally waste the support team's time! What a GREAT idea.
---
lol, and what about those of us who have 1 of each race and gender and armor class?
---
Where do I fall?
---
You forgot Dragonfall, Ember Bay, Draconis Mons...
---
It's not only a lack of a direct portal, it's the lack of any real canonical connection.
---
Even the PoF expansion only offers one-way travel. And the travel is meh at best, because it doesn't plop you down at port, it chucks you into the middle of the city. I want canonical connections. Ideally, I'd love to have an airship that will take me to any of these maps, and I can sit and wait on the ship and watch clouds fly by as I go to the map (with the option to skip that part) in a 2-3 minute voyage while I'm free to roam the ship. But damnit, I want canonical connections at the very least.
---
but you don't need 100% BD at all, maybe if you didn't run it you would do some damage
---
You don‚Äôt have to open those boxes you can also sell them. And yes I want the account upgrades
---
Seconded. Silk is super cheap and easy to get. If you really are unwilling create a [Bag Opener](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/) character and you'll be rolling them.
---
Totally unrelated question.
---
The cooldown on your skills. Is that an addon?
---
Holy Alchemy that's a lot of orges
---
Nope, just a toggle in the options
---
hu? this is gw2 basic
---
i am here since day one. i left wow cause this had no endgame. the whole game was supposed to be endgame. autolevelled to maps is great.
---
you like being in queensday doing champion train (when it existed) ? you could and i was the same than doing it on a level 80 map
---
too many maps is a concept so stupid. too many ? really ? this is waht we compain now ? not enough content byut hey too many content too.
---
pvp need to be reworked . 
---
wvw is good but without reward is nearly pointless
---
both for pvp and wvw u must realize than most player do not like player vs player action. that' s all.
---
that√¨s something anet knows so they left what exist for pvp and wvw and moved development resources where playerbase is : maps  pve.
---
it's not my decision. everything is data driven.
---
dungeons were abandoned because was impossible to mantain.
---
The build for alacrity renegade is great for a pure power build if you just swap to berserkers armor and switch your renegade grandmaster trait.
---
it's called hypotetical situation you moron
---
really m8.. you should learn how to read before answering
---
you couldn't even quote me right "even if im not playing **IT**" as in that game mode i mentioned
---
and i've been playing gw2 for 5 years, if you could read you would already know, 3 years of strictly wvw and pvp...
---
but anyway i won't waste more time talking to a selfish kid who can't even read properly, why don't you go kick some more "trolls" of "your" game lmao
---
funny you were the one calling me a kid and a moron...
---
Yo she was the shit back in the day!
---
Silk is so cheap ... just buy it.
---
For obsidian I prefer buying with airship parts+karma. 
---
I do SW if I feel like it assuming it is for chest train and not buying with crests since that has a gold cost in addition to the crests. Same issue with unbound and volatile magic.
---
You would take the chaos trait line and every shatter would apply an AoE boon around you. You could literally upkeep 100% duration of every boon, even resistance. It was ridiculous.
---
My favorite was running into a guy named Kournan O'brien.
---
I like how you make excuses/reasons why certain areas of the game are empty when literally that is the point I am making. There's nothing to argue here; half or more of the game is dead. PvE/PvP/WvW included whether it is liked or not.
---
If you want to talk about PvE content being too much, then I can give you a very inexcusable example. Ember Bay, which is a LS3 map, was a popular spot for casuals and new players alike. It was well developed with easy daily hearts and continuously-popping event bosses. They even sold a teleport scroll from the gem-store. Not only did they recently nerf the map-dailies to a once per week schedule, but the map was already slowly dying from other LS maps opening up too fast. Now there are ways to avoid this, but Anet pushed maps out too much and too fast.
---
oh so im the stupid and you are answering posts you don't even read... excuse me what? geee and you continue to act like an asshole
---
"  this is a casual player game and guess what ? do not care . we just wanna relax and have fun. "
---
and you are not a selfish person? im sorry are you stupid? or you got dropped as a kid too many times?
---
so as long as YOU have fun no one else cares... my god....
---
you do not even play anymore. why are you here.
---
selfish ? it's a game. i'm happy i'm having fun. if u do not like this game there are many others out there.
---
it's not like i'm not letting ytou play anything. 
---
let me understand. you want me to change a game i like to something i do not like so you can have fun ? 
---
who is the selfish ?
---
and still you are the stupid wasting time on a sub on a game you do not even play anymore. you must fell really lonely
---

---
actually i see an improvement in the dailies. this way there are more player at the same time on a map so you can complete more complex events.
---
3 years of strictly pvp and wvw. jesus take a break or change game.
---
there are many other game u will enjoy more.
---
right there, start reading friend like wtf, when did i said anything about changing your game??? you enjoy mindless non stop farms of mobs to earn fake gold in a game, or single player bland story modes in an mmorpg? fine!
---
enjoy it! but don't stop me from talking about how much i dislike the state of all the other game modes you completely ignore, because meanwhile you enjoy those game modes, every other player who liked pvp/wvw/raids/fractals feels out of place...
---
but anyway you are a selfish person who doesn't care so lets wrap it up here and stop clearly you won't start to care all of the sudden
---
OH BOY thats my last reply you are clearly blind or something, i've never said i stopped playing... 
---
you know what? im sick of you, go fuck your self selfish kid, enjoy your game and continue to not give a fuck about anyone else, good for you bye bye
---
ANET depends on it
---
Absolutely true. I'm a big fan of the two GDQ events in summer and winter and absolutely love their mix of runs from several minutes to several hours. I think for a possible competition format like ERP the fc w1-7 runs are just too long. For regular runs with the goal of a record entry in a database it would be a nice addition to the existing competition on single bosses and wings
---
Yes I addressed this in the second half of the sentence.
---
Here's a build template for here: OQhkAsC8gFKzJY6lDMdDBcaGgIA
---
&gt; 10 or 20 man 
---
It actually is doable but not with your usual open world player with random green equimpent pressing 1.  
---
I have done it with less than 10 before though.
---
Have you tried disabling XMP?
---
How are the cards' temps?
---
Latest drivers on the card / cpu?
---
Ele is alright. Bleeding and burning. Both tempest and weaver can be condi builds too. Staff is decent for open world with aoe. Weaver sw/d or f is good. Just stack might and just keep burning and bleeding. Tempest has overloads which is a good amount of aoe condi.
---
Oh look, it's Joko's harem.
---
they just have retarded engine and doing this whoud months for one set.
---
Honestly pick whatever you want, but don't let ping be your deciding factor, it should basically be a non-issue. The same people that recommend you tanky or subpar builds recommend those same builds to new or casual players. If you want to be better than that, don't take their advice.
---
We've had God like Aussie players compete in the ESL (pvp E-Sports League) and win the ERP (PvE Elitist Raiding Party), believe me when I tell you that they were some of the craziest high risk players out there.
---
this looks like kingdom under fire lol
---
The main problem I'm running into in my groups of 50+ is we're breaking the first bar just fine, but then we immediately burn the boss to the next bar, I mean 75% to 50% within the 5 second period of increased damage. No one's CC has had a chance to cool down at that point, so it fails. This is like the one time I wish most people were autoattacking bearbows, don't nuke it so damn hard guys
---
Only 1070 AE kids get this
---
Actually the main problem you're running into is being part of a group of 50+ :(
---
Considering the current lore plot, I hope this isn't ominous for Queensdale...
---
an issue as old as feasts themselves
---
Red Dead Redemption 2 was causing random issues for both Intel and AMD, nothing to do with the arch, there are many games I have played on Ryzen no problem
---
Disabling XMP, do you mean I should run my RAM at 2133 MHz? not something I'm willing to do, Red Dead Redemption 2 was more problematic for most people and it ran like a charm on this new PC
---
Until our dreams were shattered by Chak Egg and Liquid Aurillium.
---
Okay so you skipped over the other questions. Drivers up to date? Is the card running hot?
---
If youre going to post to a forum for help, well need some insight to what you have and havent tried. We cant recommend next steps with only specs.
---
Well, all most if not all champs are intended to be killed by more than one person due to them hitting like a truck and such. As for rotations; don't bother with it until you start with end game as rotations during the early game don't really exist due to everything dying faster than you can preform it.
---
That said, while in assassin stance, have Impossible Odds enable at all time during combat to effectively double your damage output and while in dwarf stance have Vengeful Hammers up all the time as well. This will allow you to focus more on dodging attacks and positioning.
---
Traitwise, you should run Devastation, Retribution and Invocation as they will be the most helpful during the leveling process.
---
Prioritize getting Devastation and Retribution first as the first will help your damage and the latter with survivability.
---
In Devastation you should go mid - bot - bot
---
In Retribution go mid - mid - mid
---
And when you get to the point of having Invocation unlocked, go
---
mid - top - mid
---
As for stats, prioritize power, precision and ferocity (if possible). If you feel like you die too easily, try getting some items with vitality or toughness too.
---
Seriously what the fuck.
---
[Bountiful Disillusionment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Disillusionment/history) originally applied to 5 targets.
---
Awesome info - thank you!   
---
Any particular weapon sets I should use? Should I prioritize sword/sword over mace/axe? Drop one (or both) of those for Hammer and something else?
---
Zero regrets.
---
Those other pics though.
---
how do I get the name of the item from the item id?
---
I'm sorry, i found your flute by the lake and it's broken.

I still remember the shitstorm whrn ascended gear was released...

Shiro + Jalis are the traditional leveling legends for Revenant.  You can mess around with Mallxy with tormenting runes and condition duration food, but it really isn't worth it long-term because you waste a ton of time &amp; damage stacking up conditions that are under-utilized  (and don't last very long w/o expertise).  
---
Pretty much everything outside of elites or champions will be dead long before condition damage (and the implied survivability that it offers as an attrition-playstyle) is relevant.   It just isn't worth playing condition builds at low levels unless you're trying to be experiment or be hipster. 
---
Lots of the older content before PoF/HoT is "legacy."  Meaning that there are certain bottlenecks (eg; Structures Pre-HoT/PoF seldom take condition damage) meaning that if you're doing an event or a heart you're going to be reliant on weak auto-attacks from mace and you're going to be an unhappy camper.  
---
Shiro &amp; Jalis are pretty much about sustaining impossible odds and vengeful hammers (upkeep skills) and cycling between them as you auto-attack, cast precision strike and manage your energy (Invocation Specialization).  I'd suggest unlocking Herald first and going Glint/Shiro or Glint/Jalis because it's a more intuitive playstyle (and power-based gear is easier to acquire than expertise gear).
---
What would it be exactly? Healbrand tank + DPS that doesn't care about alacrity, along with three deadeye kiters?
---
Reminds me of when I named my Herald And Kumar.
---
Tbh I go here to farm Karma for my scourge when I need em. The only annoying part are some elites and veteran takes long to die but it's a good epi center piece,
---
That reference might be too obscure
---
What troubleshooting have you tried? Have you tried restarting your computer? Running a repair on the install?
---
In TD are already HP routes from nearest WP:-)

I see someone watches [Naruto] (https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Haku) from that mesmer ice block description
---
5k gold? You include legendaries? Just shift gear to other characters. Its all account bound.
---
Whoa, thanks for reminding me that so many games have races that aren't complete shit unlike GW2.
---
Oof someone's still feeling a bit bitter about it ;) wish I could of taken the dogs off her cos its obvious she couldn't look after the bloody thing for 5 minutes
---
As I leveled my second rev from 1-80 I did it without any boosts to get a feeling for the class.
---
I first started with power stats as well but later on I realized I feel more comfortable playing a condi variant (Maybe because I love to play condi renegade in endgame content). So If you wanna try it out, I unlocked corruption and invocation trait lines first + mallyx and Shiro (you don't need a lot of healing or survivability till you encounter hot Mobs). So I played corruption 3-3-3, invocation 2-3-2. When you're able to use a third trait line I would recommend using devastation. If you got problems staying alive use retribution instead of devastation.
---
Use mace and axe as your main weapon and staff as you need to break some break bars. Hammer if you need to keep distance for example for some hot hp's. I didn't concentrate much on using sword/sword but maybe you feel comfortable doing so (:
---
I would also recommend carrion or rabid armor/weapons. As you hit level 60 I would recommend you using the superior rune of tormenting and you won't have big problems staying alive.
---
With corruption, invocation and retribution +mallyx and dwarf I was also able to solo a lot of HoT and PoF hero points. 
---
And my dps was alway quite nice 
---
I hope that helps (:
---
Man, just last night finished my 8th elite specialization collection. I've done Verdant Brink 8 times now but I still lose my temper trying to figure out which upper canopy POI I'm missing or where exactly was the entrance to this POI which is located inside a mountain. 
---
Just did the map completion on VB on my ele, all mounts - took me 20mins following your path. And may I add, excellent route choices - Griffon really shined on this route, was fun to get to use it so much.
---
Thank you for all your work for the community. :)
---
No thanks.
---
Cheers!!
---
Doing that now, took me a while to figure out how to run the repair, I was looking for an option when it is actually a command line argument.
---
I quite like the concept of Sylvari
---
leg sword,scepter and pistol,i can salvage sword and trinkets on rene at least.
---
The topic here was ambiance and graphic design do the game. Not farming. Get it right. Play the way toy want but don't ask for easy fast stuff to something that is part of a reward system based on effort and challenge. By adding a mor darker ambiance and all the details prompted before you create a more rich ambiance. How fast/slow you get your cake is. Up to you. The game has a meaning. You have to struggle a little bit eboufbt to enjoy the experience. Gw2 is. It a walking simulator.

This is a pet theory of mine -- what if the DSD invaded the tengu lands? We'd have no way to know, and it's a giant island -- perfect for an ocean dragon to target. 
---
Plus, tengu are cool.

Which client people usually install? 32 bits or 64? I went for the 64 bits client assuming that's he norm.
