That's what stopped me as well. I'm not in the habit of swapping all my stats around constantly. Plus with Ascended accessories being so cheap I can just grab more in the new statline that I want if a new better statline comes out eventually with next LW or whenever the next expansion happens. It's a cool thing for people to work towards, it's just not something that appeals to me.
---
---
---
FFXIV is most definitely worth the subscription even if you don't think so.
---
Yep, I stated this under food, I also gave the option to buy of the trading Post.
---
Yeah. I was kinda hoping this is what was going to happen at the end and not some charged leather saddle or something.
---
Yeah, those centaurs were pretty cool, until they got wiped out by Joko.
---
I know, but why the cards with the waterdrops on them?
---
i think the worst part about this who thing is ls4 maps farming
---
Dude, don't lie. People were angry just as much as they are now. Just because it happened so long ago, doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
---
No, thank the four.
---
Fair enough. My reasoning was a bit off upon looking back. The Skyscale has its evade frames reserved for example, so it'll be much easier to cross terrain with lots of anti air.
---

---
It will have its niche(s), the rentals are just too limited in and of themselves.
---
Skyscale collections have you going to core, PoF and LS4 maps... Part of the last collection apparently has you collect 250 of each LS4 map currency.  
---
Nothing was actually added to or changed about any of the maps AFAIK.
---
I did that a few times, for character slots and once for a cosmetic.  Since they clamped down hard on the gold supply it hasn't been feasible for me, though.
---
Warframe does something similar though it's structurally entirely different - players create Platinum (plat) by buying it with real money.  They then trade it to other players for rare drops.  It's possible for players to amass plat without paying for it themselves, though it requires a lot of grind.
---
I finally got decent at several of them but good gravy it took a long damn time to get there.
---
I had to google to see what Kourna is.
---
All the other maps I've been to have been pretty crowded, I haven't been in Istan though, I left it for last since it's easier to complete it by doing hearts. Maybe that's why not many people are going?
---
I've ran back to plenty of Centaurs after they trash talk you when you run far enough away from them.
---
Just brought on three friends as new players, gave them two 20 slots bags each hehe
---
Laugh all you want, platforming is hecking difficult for some people.  And we tip mesmers accordingly.
---
If I want to do pointless stuff with no progress towards my accounts and characters I would play shitty brs.
---
Just because you make a strawman meme doesn't mean it isn't timegated.
---
I can keep working towards the components of a legendary as I go along even with the hard gating a legendary has.  I can earn gold, materials, craft components and gifts while I wait for that cooldown.  However, the skyscale just stops you fully and makes you wait 24h to do anything for it without having the courtesy of telling you what may be needed next.
---
I mean you get around 70-80g+ drops for 2-3h of raid full clear, there are not many open world stuff more profitable than that. Only issue is that its once a week clear.
---
I'm old, I have crappy APM, and tons of visual noise makes it worse for me.  I've learned to do many of the JPs in the game through sheer repetition but if they're dailies they're so noisy I just can't.
---
Agreed, I think players who laugh at people who are struggling with content are assholes.  Empathy costs nothing, folks.
---
&gt; I don't understand why some people here try so fucking hard to downplay or make fun of every single negative aspect and legitimate criticism in this sub.
---
You'r discussing an MMO with people that are playing 7 years after launch. It's safe to say people here are pretty emotionally involved and get defensive when critisisms are made.
---
Why would you have lws4 currency leftover though? I've never farmed any maps, so I didn't have any of some, ever. I once slowly farmed difluorite for a trinket, I obviously wouldn't go back and continue since it was a bit tiring, same thing for Beetle, very annoying. Then I had almost a stack of Kralkatite ore, but a few weeks ago I checked it and saw I wouldn't need to buy anything from it, so I converted it to volatile magic, to get gold. I mean why not do this?
---
I never made it further than about three paces into the SAB lobby.  My display hauled off and punched me in the face so hecking hard I had to leave the content immediately.
---
That's what I'm hoping for, with balthazar and the rev wields it like he did. I doubt it but we'll see.

Why do the greaves look like shit now?  They used to be sleek when they were datamined now they look like ur calves suddenly gained 100 pounds.  They're awful now
---
Nope.
---
New player: I just found out Norns can shapeshift as a Racial.   
---
  
---
(I know the racials may or may not be "weak", so don't bother telling me not to do it)  
---
Which class (or classes as a tier list) best suit the build/theme of a shapeshifting Norn?  
---
1. I'll be playing casually, and PvE (I don't care about PvP)  
---
2. I will probably focus on Bear form (the Norn racial shapeshift; "Become The Bear")  
---
3. Prefer melee
---
&gt; They just want endless, constant content that’s obtainable instantaneously
---
that's free
---
Or just a new player who doesn't know that this game is built around horizontal progression yet.
---
If only they'd change it like how the pof outfit was changed
---
lol istan obliterated the economy harder than anything before it, even sw and leather farm
---
You could also praise him yesterday since he was the incumbent...
---
Divinitys Reach I would assume.
---
Paper bags can solve any problem.
---
The griffon takes 10 items that cost 25g each. You don't need to save up 250.
---
These people never have any actual ideas. They complain about the nebulous 'content' being missing and when Anet updates they whine because they actually have to play the game. They're just in a whiny entitled loop of not realising they either need a break from the game, or not to pursue everything in it, but hell will freeze over before they accept that something might actually be good even if they don't like it, so they'll bitch and moan about it being unfun because everything must suit their own needs and wants.
---
&gt;  had Aurene's ascension as a much more ambivalent thing, with her first words, "I'm the new god of war."
---
Yeah, no thanks.
---
&gt; the idea of her functioning as a prism that opens up a spectrum of possibilities, or focuses chaos into a single path
---
So I had the right idea based on the art they showed, that Aurene is actually a "new" dragon, like Kralk said, in that she's a Prismatic dragon. Immune to the "torment" that the others face for absorbing so much opposing magic based on the way she was hatched and the early bits that happened to her. (Born Crystal, hatched using plant/undeath, absorbing some of the power of the god of war, etc) Similar to how Kormir was different than Abbadon when she stole our, err, "Ascended" to godhood.
---
Reading the rest of it I'm glad they didn't use her outline. Granted she could be pulling all this out of her crack as a way to screw with the community based on how things happened, especially the "this was potentially the last LW Season, so take it or leave it but I'd rather leave it all. I like the Prismatic bit but everything else, not a fan.
---
All classes have melee builds. Ranger would be good, so you can be a bear with a bear friend following you, and get a bear mini.
---
Yea I don't know the reason but mentioned this to a friend a few hours ago too, they're definitely wider around the top and ankle. THe fact they're chunkier is making me not wanna get them now, really look odd with the look I was going for, which is a shame. but personal pref, I'm sure others prefer them like this
---
Maybe we didn’t want all of those in a succession of surprises.
---
Why? It's pretty evident that part of the story was pre-planned unless for some reason you are assuming they released the game without any idea of what to do next and Season One, including it's culmination were just haphazardly thrown together as it came out?
---
I mean beyond that there is also the fact that GW2 makes a good fuss about the Sylvari all the way up until HoT, (not entirely unlike how Season Three kicks off the Human focused stories) with the large beats of their overall story flowing pretty neatly, especially when you look at the Dragon you fight in the Dream before you wake up - if that wasn't intended as a hint towards future story then I'd happily rip my nipples off.
---
Tyria is the back of a giant turtle swimming through the Mist?
---
There are so many things they could have implemented with a decent overhaul of Guild activities.
---
It's such a shame.
---
&gt; what else does it give you
---
* Nine elite specs
---
* Multiple important masteries
---
* Free ascended weapon
---
* LWs3 maps
---
There's nothing "outdated" about it.
---
["Many bears"](https://youtu.be/pMBGUD16I-Y)
---
Just in case that's not clear enough, you just need to make sure the items have different names. One attuned, one infused works. One attuned and infused and one base works. One base and one infused, you get the idea.
---
Well she also says they did an outline for season 5 so I wouldn't take this as they bomb people think I wouldn't be surprised if Anet planned for possible ends while as planning for possible futures.
---
Yep. I use it all the time in WvW.
---
What does she mean by last season? Like, ANET closing down completely, or LS stopping and maintenance mode?
---
Tyrian technology has advanced considerably I see...
---
Praise the sun?
---
"250 of each LS4 map currency" My fucking soul cries out.
---
So that means we ignore her for the rest of her life yeah very mature and grownup. She worked there so she will have an insight. Also whats wrong with being for social justice I am. I won't blow up in peoples faces at one comment.
---
They can be stockpiled in advance, even if the stockpile rate is capped per day.
---
I'm stockpiling charged quartz (still on PoF story, not up so LW4 yet) and the ecto refinements even though I don't have a use for them now.
---
Food is made in the Mystic Forge, not crafted.  You can make all twelve without any cooldown.
---
haha That's actually how I found out about him
---
Currency is only a soft timegate cause you can stockpile it in advance.
---
Very easily. This game is very alt-friendly as leveling and getting gear is pretty fast. Plus, a lot of unlocks and stuff are across your whole account, not character-specific. I'm only a moderate player who plays 90% on one class and I have gotten every class to max level and decently geared.
---
Yes.  2 character slots for free accounts, 5 for base game, some expansion versions come with more slots, and you can unlock more in the gem store - up to about 70.
---
Going back to different ways to interact with a map is only something I'm good with if they keep up with it. I understand that it takes more time and work to design around it, but having the multiple options all around Dragonfall made it really obvious to me how cool these things are but how utterly pointless they are when you try to do anything anywhere else. 
---
It felt great to go from an oakheart right into a lava tube to shoot out and aim for an updraft and glide away. I want that type of feeling that builds up across a whole LW season if we stop with mounts. A mount currently does that, in that a mount is useful, give or take some of them, across a every single other map. How many maps can I use Oakhearts or Lava Tubes on?
---
I'm not familiar with the windows API, but would it be possible to try without a UAC escalation, and then only request escalation if you failed on permissions? Or test in advance if the escalation was necessary?
---
Underwater COMBAT mount!!
---
SHARKS WITH LASERS ON THEIR HEADS! YES!
---
Ok thanks for your help
---
Edge of Destiny was pretty clear in that regard.
---
At one point Snaff basically mind-controlled Kralkatorrik, and on looking into his mind he compared it to a violent storm IIRC. I don't have a direct quote unfortunately.
---
It is actually mobile, there are apps on the market that support cloud gaming, and i do this just to do simple tasks like this because of the controls. 
---
But some of them even support bluetooth keyboard and mouse, so you can actually "play" the game if your network speed allows! Quite laggy on my 4G phone though.
---
What? [Like](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&amp;multiverseid=435425) [these](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=439857&amp;type=card)? Which is to say bodies of water surrounded on all sides by land.
---
There's a big difference between fighting for equality, and claiming everything you do wrong is the result of the male gender pushing our testosterone around.
---
They're [islands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=439857).
---
Wow, plan changed? Really? New expansion? No new season5?
---
I have played this game since 2013, but during that time I never really got into the game and played it on and off for quite some time. Since last dropping gw2 I have experimented with a few mmos and acquired a really good understanding of how these games are meant to be played / work.  
---
 
---
I am now considering getting back into gw2. But after a couple tries back with the game, for some strange reason it feels a bit different, I can't pin my finger on it but I just feel like I'm playing the game... wrong. I feel directionless, I have no idea how I want to go about various content in the game. Or what I should even be doing. (And I have several max level characters!)  
---
Is there a resource for me to better understand guild wars 2 and how it's typically played? Goals I should be pursuing? Content I should aim to complete? (Story content, expansions, etc) I've always avoided the main story and expansion stories, is much content locked behind those quests?
---
Next time check them again before buying. There are plenty of things that were datamined and were changed in some way before being officialy released or not event released at all.
---
The reason for that may be because there was some serious clipping or something. You just looked at female boots. Did you checked how they looked at other races? Maybe there was some clipping during running animation, etc.
---
Needs a plains to cast [this](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?name=Crystallization) though.
---
Not sure where you got any of that out of what I said. Yes Season 5 is next.
---
The real question is "can you stop creating multiple characters?"
---
Hyperbole doesn't at all mean that. You should maybe pop open a dictionary to check what the word means.
---
I’m on NA unfortunately :(
---
Thank you so much for your generosity all the same!
---
You can literally do that, mini tutorial:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9fqs4SKsCU
---
Well she sure doesn't seem to be tolerant of Rytlock.
---
I should be clear, I’m with you on this. I’m just trying to come up with an alternative explanation.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't low effort lore, but tbh most players probably don't care. It would be interesting to know how many people play GW2 that never played GW1. I haven't, despite investing 5 years and thousands of hours into this game. I always enjoy seeing people getting giddy over lore even though I have no personal connection to it.  That being said, I have no issue with how Gwen was handled. I honestly thought the whole PoF experience was extremely lackluster revisiting old GW1 locations, along with the Joko part of this season. The story was ok, but it did nothing for me as it relied heavily on nostalgia. I honestly wish they'd move on to new stories rather than continuing to delve into GW1.
---
The supply is near the heart npc on the floor. You hand in the supply to the same basket as the roots. You can only carry one supply at a time. Pick up supply and roots on the way. You'll finish it in 3-4 rounds
---
I don't have a lot of complaints about the game but its main story weakness has always been the flavor text/ dialog. 
---
The devs have obvious budget and time reasons to get generic about stuff but a lot of times it does lead to discordant moments. A good example is the obvious later-made insert at Claw Island that indicates, yes, your Sylvari knows Trahearne already and he didn't forget who you are. This doesn't stop your mentor from introducing you anyway and that segment is as narratively rough as a Canadian road after the spring thaw.
---
Oh that wouldn't surprise me. I understand the nostalgia and desire, however I can see how it could be considered a meme from someone who doesn't have that same insight.
---
Thanks for the info! I'm gonna try this.
---
Necro is good for soloing but it can get binary. I’ve also been enjoying revenant. It has very good open world builds for solo and team in it’s buffing capability as herald and renegade. I enjoy both power and condi variants. The damage is decent and can be sustainable with jalis or glint. Also has good builds in other game modes. Energy mechanic can be hard to get use to at first but it’s fun. All classes have fun builds in my opinion but my favorite all around solid choice is rev.
---
ha I haven't played since 2012 . .  i can't remember my info to login :\\ and oddly enough when i try to submit a ticket my serial doesn't work  . .wish me luck and how is the community?
---
"Just get better" isn't particularly useful advice, though, when someone is trying to complete a particular objective and is frustrated because it's taking a long time, because "practice" at this point is just adding to the time it takes to do the content that they're already frustrated with. It will help in the future, of course, but that's not useful for what they're doing right *now*.
---
Saying you're better isn't necessarily an attack, true... but it *is* incredibly unhelpful and unnecessary, because it does literally nothing for the person who's frustrated. You could choose to have a little sympathy for those who perhaps haven't been playing as long as you, or who are handicapped and will never be able to "git gud" no matter how much practice they get, but instead you've chosen to rub salt in the wound for literally no reason at all other than to massage your own ego.
---
Just because it's not an attack doesn't mean it's nice, and it's pretty hypocritical to complain about how people are "nowadays" when bragging about your own prowess in the face of those who have less was once considered pretty damn rude.
---
There's nothing legendary looking about the skyscale (and only 1 dye channel for this entire thing). I would have been fine if each and every collection would unlock after the reset even if you have it completed or not. (It 100% has to be done in order to unlock the next step after reset)
---
At least give it a soft lock. Like if you're missing a step or two from one collection. The other part of the collection is still soft locked until you complete it but auto locks when you get it done. That way you don't have to do it in a rush. I thought when we got to the \*feeding the skyscale\* that those other collections would unlock too... nope. It had to be 100% done and wait after another reset.
---
I'm fine with the time-gate but getting a stack of each of those 6 map currencies just burned me out. I've unlock the skyscale but I honestly don't care about it anymore, I'm taking a months break from the game.
---
I'm NA, but hopefully an EU player will be along to help.  Don't be afraid to ask in-game, or on this subreddit's discord (see sidebar), and check r/GuildRecruitment for casual/mentor guilds.
---
Do you have a link to the other version?
---
No, don't do this.  This is unsafe advice.
---
Unfortunately, reset on Friday is usually when I'm working :( 
---
I'm Fort Aspenwood, if that helps.
---
http://gw2crafts.net/
---
use this until you get 400 in one of the crafts. If you're playing mesmer and necro then I would get tailor for the armor and maybe artificer. You get 2 professions per character so if you need things like greatsword for your mesmer then you can get weapon smithing too. Eventually you'll need a lvl 500 craft in all of the professions so take your time.

Nah, it's just that she's not just happy about her great great great... grandson's choice for a boyfrie.... errr blood brother.

Though it would have been nice to have her recognize you as an ancient spirit like Dunkoro does when you meet him when you have GW1 linked account.
---
Experiencing the same issue. I can get as far as the character select.
---
If you're brand new you can delete all your characters and transfer for free. If you're on the US you should be on a US server. I help people out all the time, so hit me up in game on Vayne.8563
---
Imagine if they just added ascended armor/weapon sets to dungeons for a massive dungeon currency cost + gold/ecto/whatever.
---
I have two characters and i can transfer for free.
---
Can see when FA [held the most keeps here](https://wvwstats.com/grapher?server=Fort%20Aspenwood&amp;data=keeps) and judge based on that. Looks like it's mostly 3-12 hrs after reset.
---
I wouldn't consider deleting/remaking/boosting characters something any reasonable person would do, so for all intents and purposes it is time gated.
---
Have you joined a guild? It might benefit you to find an active social guild and just fake it til you make it. Listen to people chatter about what they're doing, and either ask them what they're up to / what benefit it is from doing that, or wiki / google as appropriate to do the same if you don't want to be asking questions every five minutes. You can then go "oh that sounds neat" and boom, you have some direction for a little while. 
---
It does generally help to do the stories, they take you over the maps, introduce you to what's going on in certain regions and will point you to more content / achievements, helps you connect with the world sorta thing. Stop and smell the roses, talk to npcs, be part of the world. It sounds flowery and whatnot, I know, but hey, it might work for you :) 
---
You can use the achievement panel as a sort of quest list, find something that sounds a bit interesting and go about doing that!
---
ah okay, you only get one free transfer, if you started off as a free to play player and then bought an expansion.
---
Do you have friends that you're planning on playing with in the EU? Or are you wanting to play in a different language?  If not, then you'll probably get better ping playing on NA.
---
As someone who doesn't like the timegates (specifically the use of charged quartz over other items that could actually use a good sink), I think the armor set is a great implementation of repeatable content. It's going to take me a long time to get all the skins, but I can really clearly see the progress I'm making. In contrast to the Requiem armor which I still haven't gotten because my progress is locked behind events no one does anymore.
---
I get the pun but there's actually a lot of funny stuff you could probably do with it lol.
---
to what server do I transfer?  does it matter?
---
this sky scale mount is so successful! lots of people in all the maps! that means that a lot of people really really really wanted that mount
---
This look on gw2styles might be what you're looking for:
---
https://gw2style.com/look.php?id=8854
---
Server only matters for WvW. It doesn't matter at all for open world PvE or PvP. My server is full. I guess the question is how important is large scale PvP to you (which is called WvW).
---
I would like to play WvW eventually so..
---
&gt;  Unique Multibox Management
---
Currently under Advanced settings there is a button to "Configure Windowsettings"   This is where you can resize and position the window.  However my OCD kicks in when I can't get all the windows I want to use the exact same size and positioning.  Was wondering if in an update you can put somewhere to specify exact window dimensions and position on screen.  Where it would take the top left most part of the screen as `0, 0` for position.
---
&gt; You can buy 5 of each currency every day from the Traveling Elonian Trader
---
Phew, at least some good news.
---
Anet actually fired her because of her negative activitst attitude, not just for saying one thing.  A community member offered a suggestion, and because he was a "male", she took it personal and attacked him, and everyone else.  Then another Anet dev joined in the attacks.
---
So it was a combination of things, not just one instance.
---
My Theory: Aurene can go back in time now through the mist (remember when kralky made space/time portals and bring an orrian battle to Jahai?) and she becomes the mother of Kralkatorrik. She goes back to the beggining and have children, and kralky is one of them.
---
I don't think any of the currencies are hard set in stone timegates, as you always have the option of rolling a new character, getting it to 80 (is that actually required?) and going to the map to do more heart quests.  However, it IS severely diminishing rewards (DM).
---
Orr could do with an Ov-Orr-haul, for sure.  It's good content but it just doesn't have the same draw as SW, DT, or HoT/PoF.  It could use a buff, though I don't know what that would look like.
---
I think the reason Istan was a gold faucet for as long as it was is it probably incentivized sales.  Now they want people to spend time on newer maps, and older maps, and don't need the draw anymore.
---
Now if only they'd get rid of the fjkdlghjskfdhg meta-locked POIs in LWS4 episodes.
---
I'm in America, where Jessica and her friends are.  I'm moving to Japan.  She would hate that, because men are superior there.
---
I'd rather they fix the buggy events on the past maps, make them rewarding by giving them unique rewards that aren't anywhere else.  The leather farm in Lake Doric was a nice start but then shipments happened and leather is really easy to get now by just farming VM.  Thunderhead has a requirement to farm it for diviner's stats or pay that premium on the TP.  The rest of the maps could use something like that.
---
I really hope we're gonna have another dwarven map that's not heavily altered / constantly occupied by minions. I honestly love the aesthetic, the lore, everything behind the dwarves, and while what is there is really cool and easily makes THP the best LS4 map for me, I still wish they wouldn't have branded so much of it.
---
I think someone at Anet really liked working on this map as well, there's a ton of little details to make things more believable that's not really seen in any other map. And the amount of new assets they made just for this is astounding but also makes me hope they have more plans to use them again in the future.
---
Nope. Preferred Dulfy cause I didn't have to watch a video. Just read and look at screenshots.
---
I haven't done any of the 4, since I don't deem any of them worth my time.
---
I mean its the same world, just in the future. Visiting old places is inevitable. But the story doesnt need to visit the past with it.
---
So uhm, I did everything from 2-28 but I can't interact with the first. I fully restarted and tried it on multiple characters. Any ideas?
---
Thanks for the input, it helps! I guess I'll grind for gold to unlock Living World seasons.
---
I shouldn't laugh at this, but.. yeah, lol.
---
Now do it on an ele. Jking lol that's awesome though!
---
You are maybe the best troll account I've seen in a while. Well done.
---
oof
---
I mean... not really. She's all over the shop, and becomes even crazier during the War in Kryta (she's even at the throats of the Shining Blade). Eye of the North still has Gwen constantly threatening her allied charr, even at the end of the story.
---
I think that new guild missions would be nice but it isn't the most important thing. More important is making it easier for people to find guild via in-game means beyond map chat advertising. I think ArenaNet has forced themself into a position where they have to churn out content because people spend more time completing everything instead of just hanging out with people and doing things as a community for the sake of fun. If they encourage guild participation and community generated content they could take the pressure off a bit.
---
Well it does have that special plating that you can't see up through but you can peer through the holes on deck.
---
I tested mine today. I get less flax than I normally do at the flax farm. It was all 11-13 per toon and it's usually 13-20 (with boost from candy corn gobbler).
---
GW2 does not have 'outdated content'. All content is relevant even when development on it has stopped.
---
Even dungeons, pretty much abandoned, still remain relevant thanks to upgrades and legendary crafting.
---
Yeah, having the same issue. I can access the forums but can't log in. I was crafting in-game, the game froze, I alt+f4d (sometimes it's my pc acting up), but restarting hasn't proved fruitful yet.  
---
I'm also in Aus, but idk if that's part of the issue. Figured I'd include that as well just in case.
---
I saw the description and it seems situational. It would be ideal for farm nodes like the flax, strawberry, etc.
---
That video shows it has quite the range to it as well. Would certainly cut down daily farm time for home instance and guild gathering. The trade-off would obviously be whatever other bonus you'd normally have for the tools you have this glyph in.
---
Maybe if it was worth going back. Posting this meme means you don't understand that.
---
Im able to play just fine in NA
---
Take my upvote and go.
---
Any more mounts, and they better add a better way to switch between them, like a radial menu, or a button to extend the mount list like when right-clicking the mount button, that also shows the mouse cursor  if in camera mode, then puts it over the currently selected mount in the list, so we can right click the mount we want to equip next.
---
so far it seems like it might be an Aus issue cause all my NA friends aren't having problems.
---
Same issue here, was just about to submit a support ticket.
---
sounds like the whole ‘timegate’ drama tbh. hey, im happy you’re not scared to look in the mirror.
---
Also from Aus. Can't log in. I get different errors each time but an error all the same. It was weird, all of my actions wouldn't work but everyone around me could still chat and perform actions.
---
Deleted from forums lul
---
They do look terrible now, in the pile of the rest of shitty fat cankle heavy boots for females.  Had gems waiting for them but guess i have to sit on them now
---
I have to admit Kourna is a shameless guilty pleasure of mine.  Love farming the meta.
---
Just wish it had a bit more epic end boss. 
---
If they did the lanes system, it would've been really nice too... But I'm sure all of reddit knows.
---
This is how I play the game, it works flawlessly.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

I'd have been more than okay with that, my AGs are just sitting in the bank - I don't even know what they're used for.

I was redoing the story from season 3 with a buddy. And I was explaining what was going on every time he was confused. I found myself saying "remember we're the good guys" quite a lot to him.

The Lutris script for D9VK works perfect for me. I can’t believe the performance. I’ve played it in WINE for a long time and it’s like literally double the performance of what it was 3-4 years ago.

AUS here, same issue here. I was online this morning and suddenly it crashed, now I can't login due to errors ;(

Couple of my Guildies (also AUS) having same issues now

Down for me, Aussie

You and your fem nazis can have Trump.  I'm off to a fresh start next year.

Just don't sell anything you'll wish you had when you come back.

Its about teaching people to do things by hand and its better that way incase the script breaks they know how to bypass it
---
I agree, looks horrible on a medium toon. Esp when you got skin tight pants for a human male. Oh boy .... what a waste of a nice concept
---
Oh people can go about it however they want, Im not gonna police your farming practices. I was just pointing out that this is (most likely) the most efficient way to farm map currencies.
---
There are Charr ghosts in the Mist Wardens too...
---
Also, Rytlock shows way more hostility in the first place.
---
Leading off with "Goremonger" is always great...

The commander doesn't get the option to do that.

speak for yourself, sky scales problem is why I don't have legendaries either
---
&gt; The last is a ~~single dye channel mode of transport~~ *fucking dragon*.
---
She's tolerant enough of Rytlock. She shows some curiosity and reluctance, but gives in when Logan puts his put down, which is fair enough IMO considering that Gwen has been dead for hundreds of years (it's amazing what having actual time to reflect can do for a person) and, you know... *the world will end if we don't all work together right now*.
---
To really speed up guild hall and home instance, you'd need the glyph on all 3 though.
---
Logan WAS extremely offended by this in Edge of Destiny, seems possibly reasonable.
---
tyyyyyyyyyy

Just got Path of fire for $15 bucks looking to play either revenant or elementalist, I’ve tried them both with lvl 80 trial but I can’t decide. Coming from EOS the mages seem a bit weak and the revenant is super slow with weird hit box and animation is clunky? GW2 noob and help would help!!
---
Same, but idk half the time if it's the server or if it's my internet being stupid.
---
It'll take me couple of months to get it since I need 250 currency and I don't have much time so I only log in do a heart in all maps each day. I'm fine with it. A long term goal is good for a game without many content updates.
---

I'm a solo EU player since the beta but love to occasionally mentor new players. Still looking for some guidance or just a buddy to help do some events together send me your account name with 4 digit number and I'll add you.
---
To me Largos twins seems very much like last boss in 99CM. Lots of positioning, dodges. When I first did W6 and got to them I noticed that the fractal players that played regularly T4 and CMs had no problem with the mechanics while the other ppl were failing them constantly.
---
In the end is just experience I guess..
---
Nope.  Buying it from the trading post is the quickest way.  Look for the named armor, it's cheaper than the crafted stuff by a good amount.
---
I was... /cry. Should i look into crafting them then?
---
No sexy skins allowed
---
really good. my one gripe is the colour of the chest armor, I dont think it is supposed to be that darker grey colour, but rather just the same bronzish tone as the greaves and skirt. It only looks darker in the images because of weird shadowing.   
---
This is much more obviouso n the picture of Kassandra where her torso and legs are in the same light and all the armor is clearly the same colour
---
My only complaints are that theres always spirits in kalla and theres no offhand casting weapon. Whatd be the offhand? Sword? Axe? Both are melee weapons.itd need either a 2h casting item or two weapons added like spellbreaker got. Dual sceptors could be fun..
---
I'm also Australian and having trouble logging in.
---
I'm with Optus and living in Sydney. No problems with other games.
---
This is used to remove 1h weapons that wont be swapped if there is nothing going in that slot on different build, or if change of hand slot is required by a different build... It all gets messy at some point on alts with many builds who have multiple combinations of weapon holding (warrior for example) so i just use an extra template to equip two 2h weapons before using actual template i need.
---
She ia a bich but she doesnt lie.
---
It would fuck up your whole personal story
---
You missed the glider
---
Appreciate the reply :) Don’t have a ton of gold now but i’ll start saving up! Don’t really understand the dungeon part as I haven’t tried participating one but i’ll try to join one soon! Thankyou!!
---
Wow, I had no idea my *legendary* sword and trinket gave me all that stuff! I thought they were *just prestige items that I put the work into obtaining* ***not because they were significantly better than other things but because I wanted them and they looked cool***
---
Looking at how they steadily removed resources from this game was obvious for many they dont want to support gw2 anymore. Until ncsoft stepped in and left them with nothing but gw2
---
Content? Both are on top of pve dps lists, both are quite advanced in difficulty - to be good at, both have other role builds, both are strong and fast, not weak and slow, idk what clunky means.
---
Heavy armors have slightly better look options on male humanoids.
---
My loss. And Anet's too...
---
I bought the gloves because they seemed slim enough to  fit my Deadeye. 
---
Was ready to buy the boots too but thought they felt much too thick for my character (skinny human girl).
---
I definitely would have picked them up if they looked how they did in that gif.
---
I think that the boss punishing downed players is a part of this. A guy dying on a pool or the tornados happening to land on them can make you completely lose a player really quick and since you're already split on the last two platforms ressing isn't as easy as it is in bosses where you have 10 guys stacked on each other.
---
^yep. If the neck and shoulders bother you that much, all you can do is switch to a female model or level a new toon my dude :/
---
Definitely worth it
---
I’ve had a long time to think about the Skyscale and have made a few posts on this topic.  
---
I’ve come to the conclusion that the issues regarding time-gating and player expectations are really just symptoms of a much larger issue.  I’m specifically referring to how the Skyscale mount and the Skyscale quest have been designed and implemented.  
---
At the moment, the Skyscale mount/quest has managed fallen into an awkward “no man’s land”.  The mount is too niche to be a prestige mount and the quest is too grindy for something that is not prestigious.  Additionally the mount doesn’t have any alternate skins so it’s not necessarily going to attract the cosmetic end game players either (e.g. Grand Lion Griffon skin).  For what is probably the most ambitious mount in the game, it doesn’t really appear to achieve anything at the moment.  
---
I used to work in software development and have about 8 years’ experience in that particular industry.  The above issue I just described is generally why you have “Business Analysts”.  They’re the ones that keep track of the business requirements (what do you want to achieve) and the functional requirements (how do you want the code to operate).  If the business and functional requirements are not in sync, you get issues with your software solution.  
---
From my personal experience, when the business and functional requirements are not in sync, it is a really hard issue to fix post-production.
---
She was actually lying about that, but of course you take her word for it.
---
Actually I have a REALLY hard time understanding her. 
---
Her voice is extremely quiet to me.
---
250? no, i'm not getting off work to get on work. f that. bye
---
This is manipulation and something people here warned anet about when they hired her. They deserved this lesson. And it has nothing to do with game development. You can hold your horses captain, she is gone, she wont hurt you.
---
dragon mount is slow and doesnt actually fly. griffon was easier and is still better. good job. you know how to not make a game fun.
---
When did you start playing, 5 seconds ago? 
---
Those had similar feedbacks except weapon which has literally zero timegate unless we are starting to call it a timegate to wait for it to be actually designed.
---
At least this post shows just how hard veteran players are quitting the game over time if it reaches 90% upvotes.
---
Yeah had about a few friends check to see if they can log into the game and those who aren't with Optus seem to login just fine  
---
i'm also with Optus
---
I find Largos is just the "git gud" boss.  
---
Have a good kiter for tornadoes, drop the bubbles on right spot, and avoid the AoEs. Simple at that.
---
It is not true though, people hated aurora timegate. People complained about the ring not being there both w5 **and** w6. Weapons have 0 timegate.
---
"Preach".
---
Proof?
---
my only real gripe with the Gem store is the frequency that skins are pushed onto it, it just goes to show how easy it would be to provide in-game rewards, but instead, its a 9:1 ratio in skins for gems vs skins for in-game rewards.
---
Thanks best it will be boosted! That makes sense cause I’ve Ben insta dying!!
---
Ive been doing this for a few days already, given out 19 skins and 500g
---
Maybe because you are not being an adult person.

---
You write like you are becoming the monster you are trying to fight. Her attitude was not liked and neither will yours.
---
Other devs.  There were multiple teams working on multiple projects.  GW2 had their own teams, so quality wasn't sacrificed.  NCSoft didn't need to downsize, because they were still highly profitable.  
---
All this was the decision of a few top executives to increase profits.
---
Wtf aurora took ages.
---
Holy shit, you're still at it? Please stop being anal about trivial shit, thank you very much.
---
Fair enough, however that doesn't mean they wouldn't reconsider it. I'd replay the personal story if it was required.
---
Quotes, not gossip, please.
---
Hitting grenade with a hammer will remove the threat, yes, but kills everyone around in the process. Thats what commander learned in the story and thats why they cant process this way anymore. It was a theme since lw3.
---
&gt;do i need ascended equipment for more survivability?
---
Pretty much every "meta" build on that site is Power/Precision/(Ferocity, Condition Damage, Expertise).  Which means, every meta build entirely lacks defense, and relies entirely on skills, team mates, and precision dodging for mechanics to stay alive, and which takes a pretty bad beating when actually hit.
---
Ascended gear will give you more power, precision, and ferocity.  It's not going to give you any more survivability unless you change your stats.  Switching out a few pieces to more defensive sets with Vitality and Toughness in their stat lineup will make a big difference.
---
That is why I make norn instead even though I don't really like them much as a race.
---
Tank should be aware of them and move to places where dps players are safe from them
---
Personally I don't feel like it's sincere for a male person to play a female character.
---
:)
---
She's pretty hard to understand, but her content is great and she seems like she's having a blast making it, so I like it.
---
Support for dx912pxy with an easy on/off toggle would be great as the dx912pxy is unstable when used to multibox (due to maximizing use of all available resources causing all instances of the game to bottleneck one another).
---
That way I can use the proxy when i'm only playing only 1 client, and easily turn it off when dual-clienting.
---
Yeah I don’t get the complaint.  It can fly.  You can fly while riding it.  Dye channels wot?
---
Just got home from Uni and I can't connect.
---
Sydney and with Optus.
---
Thanks
---
I pick roots near the heart NPC (and kill the few spies that I see there). When I got all/most of the roots near the heart NPC I grab a supply, bring it to the depot and come back to the heart NPC while killing spies that I see along the way, that will mean I will at most need to do a 2nd supply delivery. If I'm lucky I go enough roots + spies that the heart is complete by the time I reach the NPC so I save 1 round trip.
---
They don't replace gliders at all. I use my glider in tandem with my griffon all the time.
---
People will only Go back to the Most Gold/Hour Meta. And There can only be one. And if they make a new one People complain (old map powercreep) and if they dont people will still complain (no reason to Go back).
---
Praise Joko
---
I agree that the chunkiness is too much. I didn't preview them when they were datamined, but the slimmer version is so much more appealing.  
---
The newer chunky versions remind me of the heavy envoy precursor boots. Super unappealing and makes it look like you have  T H I C C  calves.

I don’t have a problem understanding her, but she’s just kinda soft spoken. As long as you enjoy her content :D

---
most credit card companies in my country do automatically hold charges when they seem suspicious. though usually they phone right after and can still approve the transfer if the customer consents. 
---
your argument may make sense in your country, but GW2 isn't just played by people from wherever you're from.
---
Either you see the small notification or you get used to the spawn location and you can try to see quickly where one might be up since they pop a big purple dome so it's rather easy to see even from far away.
---
Do note that you only really "farm" each rift once per character and per day and that since a lot of people will wanna get those they risk over-scaling a bit too much and not be that worth it since they will take too much time to complete for just 5 Mistonium (I will probably go do map completions and gathering for this map).
---
I played with Sylvari the first time (my main is one) and the calls and whispers from Modremoth made me really immersed into the story, Trahearne on the other hand even tho I didn't particularly enjoyed his character much but his story is actually pretty good. He was a scholar more then a warrior and he was put up a task to lead the Pact and his sacrifice at the end was actually pretty saddening. Don't want to spoil it much but pretty much HoT with Sylvari was a blast to play with with small dialogues and touches to voice lines while going through story (Canach and you mentioning about the call of Mordemoth and fighting against it) it was a blissful experience
---
Sure, ArenaNet can do a bunch of things but most of those would or could turn the MMO factor into a singleplayer experience.
---
Grieving is bad! However, you don't know their situation as much as they don't know yours.
---
What they could think could be that you get heart progression by catching those fish and they can turn it in so that you both are able to progress instead of just you. I can't remember if that is the case here so they might just don't know either if you are not getting any progress.
---
Nevertheless all hearts have multiple ways of completing them. If someone is "grieving" you just because you picked the fastest method then just go somewhere else.
---
The whole reason why they do that (if they do it intentionally) is to annoy players, the more you get annoyed or angry the more likely is for them to win.
---
regardless is it not unfair that I can't do a certain heart a certain way?
---
No, you dont own open world. Maybe they are trolling yiu, but its not blocking your progress.
---
&gt; Bruh buying too many gems doesn't get you banned unless you were attempting it on fraudulent PayPal account (fake accounts) or you bought it and requested chargeback of said purchase 
---
you said it can only happen if he did something, but that's simply not the case. those are certainly possibilities, but credit card companies can and will occasionally hold or refuse charges if their automated systems flag them as suspicious. decent payment processors (unlike digital river, which ANet uses) often support 2 factor authentication system from various credit card companies (mine uses a code sent per sms) charges confirmed in such a way will never be automatically disapproved.
---
as for it being a banks issue, partially true, yes. if the bank has proper authentication methods setup but the payment processor is as bad as digital river, then at some point you'll have to put blame where it belongs - on ANet for chosing a shitty processor and not adjusting their behaviour accordingly. it's widely known how bad they are and instabanning people with chargebacks would only make sense when the processor requires 2factor authentication etc. but when dealing with a shady company like DR, maybe it would be time to at least allow users to retry the charge.
---
The truth is GW2 switched to a really, really, really bad hosting Company.
---
why only the human zone :/
---
asura lives matter too!
---
It is also the case for most other node farms, once you harvest the last node of the node farm once, it "hard resets" the farm to the cooldown. Also the reason why you can never harvest the last node multiple times with bounty glyph and/or item booster, it is especially annoying at winterberry farm as each pair of bushes counts as one node farm.
---
to me it's once in a long time kind of game.  when you have better games to play there is no point playing this one.
---
I would just find an lfg and join new map. Or move on and go back in 5 mins
---
I for one like the rectangular maps.
---
At least it's not Wayfarer's Henge.
---
imagine all the people... grinding their life awaaayyy...
---
Anyone have a picture of the Etherbound Greaves+Gauntlets in transforms like Reaper Shroud? I'm curious if the glow effects show through.
---
To be fair, it all comes down to the type of content you like. So find something that you like. People are allowed to have differing opinions. I'm just saying that I quite enjoyed the content and as such I'd recommend doing it. I'm sorry to hear that you didn't have quite an enjoyable time as I did.
---
Mounts on hotkeys on numerpad and I don't need any "better way" to switch between them. Look at the control options.
---
"Guess I'll have tio wait"
---
you're replying to the wrong person there. I didn't comment on your situation at all, only corrected the guy above that it is indeed possible for charges to be disapproved without the users doing.
---
Easiest strat our guild found/uses is to just have the tank follow the "last" tornado. I don't fully understand the logic behind their movement but as long as the tank keeps trailing the last one, they'll never touch the group.
---
The first 3 were horrible, but those that actually made me go around the world were fun, imo
---
A nice extra once-a-day way to get map currency for all of the really expensive stuff in those maps?
---
I haven't really noticed the in game timegates because at the moment I am real-life timegated anyway. :(
---
Kralk
---
Then they can blame those who complain about the amount of content.
---
Timegates doesn't change the amount of content. Even if they put a month of timegate, nobody would say "wow they added 6 months of content!". It would still be a handful of hours worth of content regardless.
---
Only if you buy the other xpac.
---
Park your alts at draconis mons flax farm. Much better.
---
Update for optus bois: [Support response](https://gyazo.com/983f489d42d2f89f894ec255811d49a9)

I think they are only reducing the wait time, not the actual requirements.
---
Do you know aproximatly how many racing track pieces this took?
---
Hey OP, would it be possible for you to test it in an axe at the orr wood farm?  I'm thinking about picking one up for that, and leaving a bunch of characters parked there.
---
NCSoft is essentially a triple A game producing company. There's no reason for them to shift to Steam, which is for the most part targeted towards smaller game companies and indie producers.
---
&gt; You can't have both.
---
What about all these precedents of Anet giving us informations ahead of time (see the Warclaw’s map chat)?
---
I've been waiting for someone to post this meme. It's one if the first things that popped into my head when the Skyscale saga started. 
---
Now we need an "I am inevitable" Skyscale meme.
---
Remember Ascalon!
---
Without knowing their origins you cant really know what you are dealing with. Every elder dragon is a surprise, even with kralk we got surprised at the end with his body dead but heart still working. We can run around the issue of elders but without full knowledge we never know what to do besides brute fight.
---
A better explanation is Glint mellowed her out. A few hundred years spent working with a dragon champion who is constantly proclaiming that all the races need to unite? Probably rubs off on you eventually, even if you're a mist-ghost.
---
The Population in Pvp is fine in Gold Rank higer then that can happen some rly unfair matchup. PvE is population side fine.
---
The best Class now is hard to say
---
Let's try to rank:
---
S:
---
Scrapper(Ingie HoT) a really strong bunker(tank) Build can Tank alot of dmg, but has not that dmg Output.
---
Spellbreaker(Warrior PoF) a good Dullist(Dullist means he is strong in a 1v1 against other builds but can also handle some 1v2, 1v3) he can deal some real dmg and has some good surviality.
---
A:
---
Soulbeast(PoF Ranger) a realy strong dps Build, what is a little like the pistol, pistol thief. U stand at max range and try to down somebody by pressing some Button.(why not s somebody will ask, first it has some Builds who can counter esaliy that build pretty much all Dullist Build can win against it in a 1v1, snd it is a glass canon)
---
...
---
Pretty much all class has some strong Builds in PvP even Ele has a strong bunker and a Dullist Build, that means we had a rly soild PvP Meta.
---
I really hope there will be players in that maps when I have time to play. Because now everyone is rushing it to get over with it because of the same fear.
---
Going back to old maps is great if they add really meaningful content and not one time rush jp/boss/events. LP
---
I replied to both your second comment directly regarding mounts and AFKing and to your initial comment about how busy people don't mind spending a 'little effort', which you previously tied to timegates previously (..people want to access it as soon as possible, with little to no effort). 
---
You could have just replied the initial part about mounts in my comment as it was relevant to what you just said. Instead you went with 'lol ur dumb' because you are either wrong and don't want to argue it or you can't keep in mind what you have said in your own comments, which would be dumb.
---
&gt;bitch and whine about this for a week now
---
Is probably the symptom of a problem in the game. Isn't the very root of a game fun and entertainment?
---
Really, they can place any wall they want, they could even make the delay between collections a month or a year. But if they're here to entertain their playerbase, they have to understand what kind of gameplay they enjoy.
---
If we really look into the problem, the "timegates" only do two things: virtually increase the lifespan of the content so they can boast about "x days of content" (which is false) and annoy people. Besides that, it adds nothing to the game.
---
Having 2 shorbows let you swap between them to proc the Sigil of Geomancy. If can't afford a 2nd one right now you can replace Geomancy by a Sigil of Bursting, Sigil of Venom or maybe a Sigil of Blight to mitigate that loss.
---
They have Krait runes because the Shortbow build damage split leans way more in favor of Bleed than Poison/Burning like the Dagger Condi Soulbeast would. Because of this and the fact that Soulbeast does not get to use any Condi Duration increase for Bleeding/Poison in their traits you need to get your Condi duration  from somewhere else. So we have Bleed damage/generation &gt;&gt; Poison generation &gt;&gt; the rest, so we're gonna want to min-max our build to reach (exactly) 100% bleed duration while getting the best general condi duration (for Poison).
---
For this job Krait runes are great and that they use a Sinister Helm (because you would over-cap Bleed duration). The DPS loss from having your helmet in Viper shouldn't be too big (because it's literally only 20-25 Condition damage lost and 10-ish of precision) but know that it exists.
---
2 shortbows means you can weapon swap off cd for proc on swap stuff like the sigils.
---
Sinister probable because you cap on bleeding duration or somethin. If you already have a viper helm, sure use it. Sinister will be most optimal.
---
Krait runes are correct for optimal damage.
---
I have 6 characters, all in ascended gear. After doing fractals for 3 years I had many set of asc gear. Few sets were just salvaged because I ran out of space in bank. It's just matter of time when you will be gearing your characters in asc gear.
---
You don't have to craft second gear. Play fractals.
---
im from sydney and with optus...i cant login to gw2 since 1pm of today...any soloutions?
---
i think when they manage to fix the pof metas that are already enough metas
---
I'm 95% of the way to crafting my first legendary and I was torn between jumping on the bandwagon or finishing Bolt. I have 5 more days of charging crystals because I forgot that was a thing until I looked it up on GW2efficiency.
---
I went with Bolt. While huge events are fun, I am too far invested to change now. I'll just have to do it all a few weeks later and hope for the best.
---
Sigh.
---
So waiting around NOT doing the content is now legit but grinding in a shorter time is instant gratification? k
---
American west coast here; login servers are up and down for me as well.
---
Never heard of minis ? A small models following you around if you choose that one. Useless but fun.
---
How petty
---
People think there can be only one "most" gold per hour meta because GW2's meta event reward structure has been hugely inconsistent. Even now there are several meta events that are worth your time to do over just SW or whatever "one" map people think is the best.
---
All meta events could be patched to give similar gold per hour, with slightly more rewards on ones that require more coordination, and then people could just pick which one they like the most, or do all of them.
---
Speaking of doing all of them, one way to get people to spread out would be to lay on the daily reward limits hard. This would already be effective with what we have, but even more so if some meta events got their rewards boosted to match the best ones.
---
A lot of people make legendaries for their mechanics. Infinitely free stat swaps to any stats ever with sigil swap.  
---
More than enough incentive
---
That's the Fashion Wars equivalent of raiding.
---
&gt; They'd be hard pressed to give an origin for one Elder Dragon without wildly affecting our understanding of all of them, and the world itself.
---
I think they already did that when they put that "Mother" in there.
---
I just got home and can’t log in, also from Australia.
---
Speaking as someone that owns multiple legendaries including Aurora, gen2 and even the notoriously grindy The Ascension etc, the Skyscale collection sucks ass. 
---
As tedious as Aurora was, it was fun doing the massive collection spanning all LS3 maps. I'm big on lore but man, fuck the **separate** scale, sick Skyscales and eggs scavenger hunt. Those items were like next to each other too, needing us to revisit the same places most of the time, just to rub it in. Looking at you Crystal Wing!
---
I wouldn't have much of a problem if they allowed us to summon a Skyscale at will (even with masteries locked) instead of going around roosts to borrow them. Don't even get me started with *group event* locked way points. Gj Anet, I'm sick and tired of Dragonfall now and it's not even a week in yet. 
---
In comparison, the more I did the backpack collection in Draconis Mons, the more I love the map for the simple reason that we were allowed to use the vines early on. Without a Skyscale, Dragonfall map just feels like a huge tease, not in a fun way too. 
---
I loved the Griffon collection. While 250g is a hefty price for newer players, it's totally justified for such an OP and fun mount. The beetle collection was nicely done too, just the right balance in difficulty. I even have a commander tag despite being a PvE main. 300g was not easy for newbie me to earn, but I'd do it again without a doubt because the tag was totally worth it. 
---
I've yet to feel that way with Skyscale collection. The scavenger hunt in the first part should've been scaled down. It was not fun at all.
---
From my personal experience:
---
1. Your support has to be really _really_ good. That includes chronos and your group is split far out (not many groups go for portal strategy). Mediocre boons? Your damage gets too low. Bad healing? Your dps is down and probably dead in a few seconds. Spirits have to be positioned well and timing needs to be good. Right boss needs to be kited around after tornadoes, left boss tanked properly to avoid dashes.
---
2. Your DPS has to be OK-ish and balanced. Or you just run out of time. 
---
3. You can't lag or be bad about mechanics. Good tanking of each boss can potentially help but any mistake usually spirals out of control quickly. Got knocked into water? You'll be half-to-the-max stacks (which insta kills). Got knocked into tornadoes? You're basically downed in 2 seconds and dead if you're not pulled out of that. Got dash-downed in a water pool? Same thing. 
---
4. Other people have to be good at the mechanic. Got that one player who constantly drops pools in the middle of the platform? You're fucked. Tanking is not good at porting right boss away from group and it keeps getting boons? You're fucked. Positioning of the left boss results in wrong dashes? You're probably fucked. 
---
Having scourge on the right boss generally helps as you can corrupt stolen boons, but then your dps has to be good (while being bad at the mechanics). Kinda questionable.
---
Primarily, if someone keeps failing the mechanic you have to kick or just leave and find a different group. See the same people dropping pools on the first platform in the middle? Remind them they need to move to the back of the platform or else. Still happens? Bye. DPS get knocked down by a wave repeatedly and unable to dodge/jump over it even after a few tries? Bye. People keep getting bubbled? Bye.
---
It's just an unforgiving encounter. Kinda like people failing greens at Dhuum or failing to run away with a bomb. It doesn't matter _why_. If it happens over and over the run is degraded to full clown fiesta and odds of kill go down to single digits.
---
I hope there won't be any male statue related posts in the future.
---
I'm from Melbourne, and also with Optus. Cannot login, was panicking since i kept getting errors, googled everything and lucky i came across this. Seems like not just me. I just wanna play !!!!!!!
---
Gw2 combat is very dynamic as you are almost always moving around (very few skills root you in place) and dodging. Do you have more specifics about why you feel the combat is being slow?
---
If you can already get 6 out of the 9 classes right away I feel it's a pretty honest deal already. While you work your way through those 6 classes you can earn gold to get the remaining 3 classes once you get there. If you don't have all your character slots take you can always create a Rev, take out for a spin in the PvP lobby to get a rough feeling of the class.
---
Honestly you can get a lot of things (cool skins included) in this games without the gemstore. I think across all my characters I have 1 skin (across weapons and armors) that come from the gemstore, all the rest comes from achievements, dungeons, crafting, etc. Some gold farming techniques might be more efficient than other and you may have just not found an efficient one that you like yet.
---
I was here :D
---
That is for ant man's army for plan thanus but for krak instead
---
Why worse than flying chicken tho? :(
---
9 professions x 5 races x 2 genders
---
&gt; Is probably the symptom of a problem in the game.
---
No, it really isn't. This is players complaining that they can't grind things out right away. Whining that the episode is ruined, because it takes a few days before they get their shiny. Some even shouting that they are now leaving the game forever. (Although that is likely an empty threat as usual)
---
&gt; Besides that, it adds nothing to the game.
---
Yes, it absolutely does. It actually helps create a connection to the mount. It's what RPGs are actually about. I mean originally before the loot crazy grinders demanded to have everything right away. Then it becomes not about the story, but about gold per hour.
---
People are literally complaining for anet to remove WAITING AROUND DOING NOTHING in favour of LET ME GRIND TILL I UNLOCK IT OR DROP.   
---
????
---
Ah, I already got a full stack of kralkanite ore due to the meteors though.
---
cheers thanks, hopefully they fix it soon T\_T
---
Not everybody is interested in going for that tho? Most aren't in fact judging by how many auroras there were back then and a couple of months after.
---
Each tornado goes in a straight line then when it hits the edge of the platform, it rotates clockwise by 90 degrees then goes in a straight line. So all the tornadoes will kind of go the same way over time when they bounce. If you see a large gap between the tornadoes, because all the tornadoes move the same direction the gap remains over time. So if you stay behind whichever tornado is nearest the large gap and seems to follow the other tornadoes path, you can just follow this tornado as it moves and have plenty of space.
---
Man, if only the trinket was tied to the raids and the last patch didn't come with a raid, which was specified that is going to be delayed. If only the community didn't whine for almost anything. Smh.
---
Oh yeah, makes sense! Didn‘t think this far :)
---
That's just a camera angle ;)
---
Wow raids must be really hard
---
It's only logical and many animals react like this. Nothing wrong here
---
It makes sense but that's still a no from me dawg. Unless the chimera is legendary levels of amazing
---
Thanks for the idea
---
A lot of what you describe is ability though. You can make jumps on the first try with practice. With all races by the way.
---
I could see your point, if there was actual variance there. For example if the same jump worked sometimes. And sometimes just didn't. But that's not the case.
---
And you can be incredibly precise in your jumps as well. You can aim for and land on single pixels. It just takes practice.
---
It will be for two weeks only, this is not the way.
---
Did it work on tree/sapling as well?
---
I have always assumed that the majority of the market for gear was driven by folks who immediately salvage it themselves.
---
Nevertheless every few months I come across some item which I now wish to double check if it might be useful to my other characters before salvaging or selling it... and going through all the effort of getting the various characters to a bank to make this check manually is disruptive and irritating.
---
Was going to buy them after data mine. Was really hyped since I do like to you high boots in light and medium armor classes. Logged today and saw preview of another clunky skin. No money for Anet today I guess. :-(
---
&gt; Anet shows a reward (the skyscale) but doesn't tell them right away how many and what kind of collections there are.
---
Yes, that's the players fault. Where the hell did you get this weird idea, that everything has to be offered to you right away? This is an RPG. Discovery is an important part in every RPG. And yet you demand a clear guide for all content right with every patch it seems.
---
&gt; Show them a reward and the path to achieving it then let them decide if it's worth their effort and how fast or slow they wanna work towards it. 
---
And ANet even gives you a clear path. You are just complaining, that they don't also add spoilers for the last few steps right at the beginning.
---
thanks for this.
---
&gt; Just like you mean the 10 threads every day that don't exist
---
You really didn't see them? Might want to actually read the Sub, when you try and comment about it.
---
It's popularity fades compared to PvE tho. Everybody knows theres way more PvE players so it's only natural they didn't bother with the warclaw.
---
I think they're referring to the Grow Lamp from the Mawdrey collection which was LWS2 and some of the Saving Skyscales mini collections have items which you could unlock from LSW2/3 maps (Dust Mite Twisters from Dry Top/SW and Ice Storms from Bitterfrost Frontier)
---
You don't really and aren't able to do much about the dash other than just facetanking and healing it back up.
---
You can dodge the first dash if you're quick enough, if you wanted.
---
Dash is either 3 or 4 dashes I think? Sorry it's been awhile since I've actively raided. Either way, if its 3 dashes the first one won't down you, you should be at full HP as thats really the only damage on that side and if its happening now, thats a good 10-15 seconds to heal up, so facetank the first one and dodge the next two. (If its 4 honestly you should be healed by the druid's CA3 by then.)
---
If you're a DPS you can easily mitigate charges with certain skills like Axe 3, walking into a mirror, Distorting as a mirage. Druids can facetank pretty reliably and heal themselves through tons of stuff, CA4, Staff3, Healing Spring (pls druids run Healing Spring, you don't need 10 man regen for Largos).
---
Every day we stray further away from the god...

Garbage posts
---
Garbage posts everywhere.
---
I don't get it. This is some of the best progressive content you could ask for. This is still \*1000s\* of times better than mindless grind for artificial gear treadmill stats. My ascended Berserker Staff from launch is still end game today, but the content gets harder with new mechanics and mastery gating, which I much prefer.  
---
The problem I see with GW2 is a problem with Runescape also has because they're so similar, and that's dailyscape as they call it. Literally only worth your time to log in and do your dailies and it takes so long to do that (1-2 hours effectively for the dailies from all maps + gathering) that you get tired of it.   
---
This collection is a breath of fresh air. The time gating is w.e, but I like that its a long collection with a lot of quests and travelling. It reminds me of when I crafted HOPE, which was some of the most satisfying content I've played, not to mention, its like when you were starting out gliding in HoT, and it was useful but kinda shitty until you maxed it all the way out and then its a gamechanger now. Even still, gliding is relevant. I like content like that, might take a long time to finally get it, but its relevant \*forever\* end game and beyond.
---
It's the area east of where the two bosses spawn. It's the middle layer. 
---
There are more nodes, every now and then you get a grub gobbler, but with glyph of bounty I get between 24 and 30 flax each char.
---
&gt; why did we choose between Zogia and Logan I’d there is no consequence?
---
Not a big direct consequence, but one of these choices is canon, and you'll see the result later in the story ...
---
&gt; is it worth buying a character slot to replay as a Sylvari?
---
Some minor specific interactions throughout the maps. The story won't change.
---
To me and other Sylvary starters, it has a special flavor, but that's it. Liked the Knight of the Thorn little story too (I invite you to do it, plus you get a free ascended weapon).
---
It definitely is sad not seeing “guild” used in gw2 much. I thought for sure we might get some more content after the new hall was added but… least we got some decos and new icons…
---
All in all, I just hope someone at Anet is trying to improve these systems, even if there isn’t a focus group for it
---
And the material costs for the halls, holy hell. It’s hard with my 5 man guild. Shovels are a nightmare. I wish they implemented a system similar to Warframe’s where the material costs change depending on how many players your guild has
---
interesting info, but what i really wanna know: can i replace springer hotkey with skyscale? idk where else i'd bind it :V
---
Amazing. Current subjects are disussed in a discussion forum.
---
Something that stops the endless grinding. RP elements in the RPG.

---
It's actually that small. Orr's battle in the sky. Skyscale is hilariously good when mastered at getting THAT high.
---
If it really is that useless, why get so worked up about it?
---
Thanks!
---
Absolutely mind blowing to me that an accessory with a purple glow is considered a more 'legendary' reward than a mount that can fly. I guess everyone's just been spoiled by how accessible and powerful the other mounts have been.
---
Barely. It's also a _really_ bad laptop at that price. You can get something with an AMD SoC or a GeForce MX150 at that price, and the graphics performance will be doubled, if not more, or you can spend maybe $100 more and get a 1050 or even a 1050Ti.

The new Springer is a beast with the increased charge times. As long as there are ledges for it to land on it, it just shoots up walls.

---
Why do u need to go back to the old maps? What is the reason???
---
people anet made unrank also get pips i imagine less people want want to farm for legendary armor components in ranked games
---
Your first main goal can be to get your endgame lvl80 euqpiment - that means ascended tier. as yu play Mesmer and Necro, those both are light armor classes, that means tailor.
---
Ascended has nice advantage that it is account bound, so you can swap the armor from necro to mesmer and back at will. So you can make berserker's stats and use them on mesmer, and once you make reaper for necro, you can swap the armor to it and play reaper. Later on you will want one set for every character, but you can make second set condition-damage-based, so well fitting for Scourge or basic necro. But once you will want to play condi mirage, you will be able to swap the condi armor to it and tada, easy two characters geared with multiple builds and not huge investments.
---
Also, the advantage of ascended equipment is that you can put infusions into it, thus actually progress through Fractals, which are good source of money, can give you more free ascended items , and in general are fun to play. So investment into ascended equpiment is usually permanent upgrade for your characters, and pretty much worth it. (compare it to exotic armor, that cannot be reused after first use).
---
short term goal should be to refine your materials (ore to ingots etc) so they take less space in inventory, and later on, once you level up the crafting, you should start to do daily crafts (Lump of mithrilium, silk , leather ....sarch for "ectoplasm refinement" category), you will need them for ascended crafting.
---
I tested the karma version last week..
---
Well, those were instantly gone since they last only 25 or 50 strikes (depending on kind of node), and since you sometimes strike a node multiple times, they didn't last very long.
---
Remember when Anet released a manifesto video in which they said nobody likes grinding?

I don't know how shared RAM works exactly but I don't think my total RAM usage goes over 5GB when playing the game. VRAM usage is around 1GB to me.
---
I also tested on an old PC with 3GB RAM and 900MB VRAM and it worked just fine in open world but it was really pushing it, WvW would probably be nightmare.
---
how u made so much gold would be interesting :-)

Does the current version still have issues with anti-virus?
---
I love the atmosphere in Tarir over all. The music there areas it feels so calming but yet a lot of djungle monsters. The meta evens is also a favorite and especially after when you go down to all those chests. 
---
My number one choice is Dragon Stand. It was better before, now we just burn it down in one phase. The very first time i was there just two days after HoT came out was breath taking. I had not done any of the other meta events on the other maps and just eneded up here because some one said i must come and check it out. And i think that is what stuck with me. 
---
Ah the nostalgia :D
---
They are the minis the other REAL airships have out at the moment.
---
Much like Primordus beats Jormag and vice versa, Zhaitan beats Mordremoth and vice versa. Fire and ice, life and death, crystal and water (not sure how that last one works, maybe order and chaos? Stasis and change? Lightning and water?).
---
Its because the Largos Twins requires far more out of the individual player than any other raids. Its one of the few bosses I actually enjoy in the game.
---
playing solo pvp is risky, gang up with a friend or somone
---
I THOUGHT THIS WAS AMERICA
---
It is meta-testing season, can't blame. However, if you are tired of public party, try finding a pvp guild or a pvp partner.   
---
Most of the time, you will randomly run into a partner at the arena in the pvp lobby (at least that was what happened for me :D)   
---
Good luck out there bro.
---
For me it feels like i got a new mount instead of a legendary trincket which ive been waiting for all season. So far i dont like the skyscales movements they feel sluggish and if the masteries dont fix that guess i got RP mount now.
---
Yep a big collection that leads to microtransactions.
---
Same goes for you buddy. Same goes for you. But as I said, if you prefer to be dishonest and delusional, that's up to you. You do you.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Every day we stray further from kormir's light.
---
so every week there is an update and is it random during week or there is specific day?
---
But it feels like a slower spring and a slower gryphon so im trying to find the legendary asoect still.
---
: (
---
Opportunity cost is pretty high though. Not 2k high, but still.
---
Piggybacking to suggest another option:
---
I use Anydesk.
---
It's really pretty good as a remote desktop app.
---
"no u" is srsly the best you came up with? Laughable.
---
What would be legendary about it, it feels like a slower springer and gryphon.
---
I would try and get the expansion and get the Firebrand elite spec. The core guard is not bad but comparing the support between the two of them is like night and day. A Firebrand can carry hard if knowing what to do and when and whith who.
---
I also belive you need to learn how it works in GW2 and now trying to play WoW PvP in GW2. There are ofc situations that are very alike but still not. Your PvE gear for example have zero meaning in sPvP. sPvP is normalized and even have a special build tab on top of your screen were you add your PvP build together with runes/sigil and neckless. I think you already know this but since you mentioned your ascended gear i felt that i might at least mentioned if this was something you missed.
---
I leave this link to you. It is a youtuber who stream a lot of PvP and also from other playres perspective and make comments about it https://youtu.be/_tGH3dyLZPk Jawgeous maybe can give you some insight in how to play the Guardian and maybe more so the Firebrand and what your role really is and what it is not. And what other players roles are. Jawgeous is good at talking about how the game is played and who do what and why and why i often tell new/er players to watch just to get a understanding of roles and how the PvP works in GW2.
---
I think it's on Tuesdays. Not all weeks though.
---
Sorry, I don't have the full details. Just that checking once a week is enough to not miss anything.
---
Ok. What should I call in the pvp-lobby?
---
Maybe: " silver 2 lf mate to push silver 3"
---
How would you lf a pvp-partner?
---
I think it'll start off with some debriefing about what happened inside Kralk, then exploring both the implications of that and of having a benevolent elder dragon (that we know personally and are basically it not literally champions of). Though I'm sure helping find a cure for Taimi will be a big part of the season, I feel a major theme of the season will be exploring the nature of elder dragons and of magic itself. Although I doubt we'll have much contact with Steve, if any, until maybe later in the season.

Though, we are still in a fantasy game so anything goes really.

Can you give me an actual supp/firebrand build?

---
I’m looking forward to the 50-day collection to get the underwater mount, and probably the 500 mystic coins Anet will make it cost
---
When you have one update a year, ability to cheat, skillag, ability to jump inside Air keep and some other objectives without siege, server destroying reshuffle every month, and Scourge/Rev/FB meta it is natural to lose playerbase. I am surprised that actual core WvW so good that people still would eat all this shit from Anet and play.
---
Like what for example? I can never imagine anything.
---
The only thing I really do regularly is Matriarch, for the amalgamated gemstone.
---
When I was grinding these season 4 maps before, I did it for the armor and weapon skins, and the occasional mini. I'm okay with that, but it seems that's not enough for some people. Yet I have a hard time imagining different rewards.

My suggestion would be to get an affordable Chromebook for class; Note-taking, light-browsing (etc) and to challenge yourself to build a PC in the $500-600 range with a decent upgrade path.  There are lots of friendly and helpful communities to talk with. 
---
/r/BuildaPC, /r/BuildaPCSales, and sites like [LogicalIncrements](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) &amp; [PCPartsPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) that'll help you brainstorm some ideas.  
---
You're probably going to be limited to 1280x720 or 1366x768 (720p) gaming on low/medium settings for the most part.  It really depends what you're trying to play.  You'll get more mileage out of a desktop CPU than you will with a budget laptop CPU.  Most modern games really aren't budget-laptop friendly; they'll run, but they won't run well and will be fairly unsatisfying to play.

Just dropping by to say you're absolutely awesome, having seen some of the prices of weapon skins I'm in awe. Seriously though, 9k gold is amazing and it was cool to see your comment on how you got there. Thank you for making this community awesome :)
---
Nah man, Dwayna
---
had no troubles at all, did it at arround ~1 am in the morning and there was no patch in between. got the skyscale without trouble. maybe try another rift if one doesn't unlock. dunno.
---
You dont have to spam sun spirit for vigor. Morage generates perma vigor for itself.
---
I'm curious how Anet is going to sell Skyscale Skins if only a tiny portion of player base unlocks this mount.
---
When are they gonna sort it? Howcome we have access to everything else lol?
---
They added other HoT masteries as well. As you said  having more options is not a bad thing, that's why mounts can fly on their own, but gliders require updrafts.
---
If you add all features on mounts then gliding becomes worthless.
---
imagine thinking timegating is good game design LUL

What guardian do you play exactly? The class isn't the best for "solo carry", but tbh a good player can solo carry with any class up to about Gold3. If you're really a good guardian main, then you should rise in rank pretty easy. But not with a heal support build. You need a good DPS / bruiser build.
---
About half a year ago I started to play sPvP again and I really can't remember beeing stuck in low ranks. I landed in Silver 1 after the 10 innitial ranking games and went up the ladder to G3 very fast. (I always was \~G3 or P1. That's pretty much my skill level). I played a lot of ranger (Power DPS - bruiser Soulbeast, not even the suggested boonBeast build) and did just what I suggested you to do in your last post.
---
&gt; At this low rank I'd suggest to go far and just stay there, hold it for as long as possible.  
---
If you're good, you should easy and quickly win 1v1 and even win most 2v1. And you should basically never die. If you get overwhelmed, you should be able to get out. That's at least how I blasted through S1, S2, S3, most of G1 and G2. In that season I actually went up to P2 with that same (stupid) strategy. But just for one game until slowly dropping down to G3 again.
---
\--------------
---
If you can find a friend, this process should be getting even faster. One player can go far and the second one can roam.
---
\-------------
---
Also important: Top stats at the end of the game are not equal to how much impact you had. Dealt most DPS, but never enough to down a target is worthless. Healed the most to a team of s2 players... most likely worthless, ect.
---
But isn't playing in the old maps content? In order to earn the currency you can play events, fill hearts, complete the map and do the meta.
---
did u contact them? did they give an eta?
---
why are people mad? i mean they advertised it on the trailer! new map, new legendary, new mount! and they delivered exactly that....
---
As some have said, though, the timegate creates an artifical, semi-arbitrary block. I like the changes they're making to it because it still makes sense; instead of feeding a skyscale once every 12 in-game days, we actually get to feed it everyday (24 vs 2 hrs). It's much more satisfying and immersive. It took what could've been a fun quest/collection and made it just part of that dailyscape. And from the sounds of it, it's potentially a drop in the pond of time it'll take to finish it.
---
I've been troubleshooting for about 4 hours.. done so many things to the game and my network. Really appreciate this!
---
The general idea is this indeed what you wrote.
---
Since you only strictly need 1 portal and maybe a 2nd one to go to the very last platform after killing one of them and portal has a ~50sec CD with full Alacrity only 1 portal would be needed. If it's a Boon Chrono that takes the portal the boon uptime of that sub-group will indeed probably suffer but since phases will be shorter it may only be really visible before splitting.
---
I find this strat to be useful/necessary when doing low-mans but very dangerous and counterproductive for pugs/regular groups as dealing with 25% a fully enraged Twin is hellish, whichever you kill last. The dash from Nikare will completely destroy people, the bubles will hit very hard. The shockwave from Kenut will almost certainely down anybody, tornadoes will down/kill people very quickly.
---
For most groups if you have troubles doing the split you risk having even more issues doing the portal strat. It will look like you have progressed because most of your failures will happen at the last platform but you will have only moved your flag around a bit without solving the core issue. If people have trouble avoiding attacks while splitting without enrage and end up dying they will not be able to avoid them better on the last platform where the consequences are even bigger because of the enrage.
---
Note that this may not be an absolute truth but a feedback from my raiding experience that includes leading training runs on various bosses, including Largos.
---
Where is the line "What is this, a X for ants?" originally from?
---
Optus still down unfortunately; some other game servers don't seem to work either.
---
dont no, havnt unlocked it yet lol still stuck grinding mats
---
Just makes me not even try. I hate the process enough as it is, I'll sit down one day and decide to do it till it's done, then be done.
---
Being forced to essentially stop and start over an extended period of time just makes me forget doing it because I don't even want to think about it unless I'm working on it.
---
Curious, are weapons considered to have 0 timegate because you can just buy ascended crafting materials from the TP? Because only being able to craft 1 plank a day is stupidly annoying.
---
Map currency is easy to farm and many people have stocked it up. A good portion of those currencies aren't even that used  (not all maps give useful trinkets) so I can't see how people find it so difficult. It feels to me people were expecting this mount to be a free 1 hour hunt. Then they complain no content or in game rewards for game play.
---
Im also with optus, I can use a vpn to access arena net ect. but yeah mobile and main internet wont let me connect to arena/guild wars or login on the client.
---
Thanks to everyone who replied about Optus knowing about the issue and trying to fix it!
---
Here's my take on this, hopefully people find it objective:
---
1.  Comparison of effort vs payoff between Skyscale and previous Living World end-of-season reward.
---
I disagree that the effort for Skyscale is comparable with Aurora. Aurora is a legit Legendary item that required 100 Icy Runestones and a Mystic Tribute. The resources required for Skyscale doesn't even come close.
---
2.  Map currency requirement.
---
For new players, if they were to pursue some other high-value, premium reward instead of the Skyscale, they would have to put in effort somewhere else just the same. So this issue is a non-starter for new players. 
---
As for veteran players who have been playing since the start of Season 4, I find this complaint rather unreasonable. I don't farm any of the Living World maps beyond my initial targets. For example, in Episode 2, once I complete enough achievements to get the exclusive skin, and get the Golem Y backpack, I'm done. Same goes for Episode 4 when I unlock every piece of Requiem Armor.
---
That means the only way I've been getting map currencies after that is purely through daily farming of home nodes. And guess what, I have more than 250 of each except Mistborn Mote. In fact, I have over 1,000 Diflourite Crystals. This is minimal effort. 250 of each map currency is more than reasonable. In fact, a veteran player who's experienced Season 3 should anticipate this. I did.
---
3.  Charged Quartz timegate.
---
My opposition to complaints over this issue is largely the same as point 2, that if you're a veteran PvE player who has done past Living World seasons, and unlocked a Home skill point node and the Home Quartz node, there's no reason to be complaining about this. I've not farmed Dry Top at all, and have over 500 Charged Quartz. I fully approve ArenaNet rewarding diligence in the game.
---
4. Other timegates.
---
Such as feeding, I find are wholly legitimate, and ArenaNet recognizes that too. And the changes are in line with the internal logic of the game world, which is fantastic.
---
In conclusion, I feel like had ArenaNet planned for the Skyscale to be Season 4's Mawdrey/Aurora, they could and should have framed their messaging better because players are more likely to assume that the Skyscale effort would be more like the Roller Beetle and the Warclaw than Mawdrey and Aurora. 
---
More importantly, the implementation of the collections should have been more like Aurora, a process that is made up of all the epic achievements in Season 4 (1x Stellar Weapon, Golem Y Backpack, Roller Beetle, all Requiem armor, all Dragonsblood weapons) in one half, and completing meta-events/boss kills once more in all Season 4 maps for the other half. That way, loyal players who have been dutifully completing Living World content will already have half the Skyscale journey done. There's still timegates such as Golem Y, but the diligent players would feel the payoff for their effort.
---
Predictability, reward for diligence, driving traffic back to past Living World maps. That would be how I would have liked the Skyscale to be deployed.
---
Please yes do this and ranked could be team queue again!
---
And now he’s quiet 😂
---
One chrono takes portal, you drop the first one on the edge of whatever platform you don't all go to (usually the left one with Nikare but it's up to your group) and rejoin the group on the other platform. Once you phase that side you drop portal on edge and all swap over. Once that one phases you take the water spout to the next one but instead of landing you take the water spout across (chrono does land and places a portal quickly). Again you port back across and kill. Last one you leave will be enraged the full 25% so people usually leave Nikare for last.
---
glad its not just me ty for posting =\]

Update 2: [Electric Boogaloo](https://twitter.com/Optus/status/1131127868937756672)
---
You'll find this comment on pretty much every NSFW post on here
---
Dang young’ins and yer fancy new gadgets. Back in muh day, we had dem mesmer chuu chuu trains
---
I guess we are not the ones grinding.
---
Better save up some then 😅
---
Used 2 on accident, ad I didn’t know what they were
---
Maybe I don't get players. GW2 wanted to not make to many new maps. Because they where from the first day afraid of spreading the player base. They made LS1, which was AWESOME. LA changed, Kessex changed. They did very cool events on a couple of base maps. 
---
Then came the player base. "We can't do the original maps" crycrycry. Don't know if people here remember 2014/2015. But that's kinda what happened. 
---
So what did the GW team do? They started just giving what people wanted. New maps and expansions. 
---
Resulting in spreading the player base obviously. 4 new maps won't make a difference. But by know we had about 15 new maps. And to make sure people come back there they think of something like needing the map currencies. 
---
In their effort to constantly do things right for the crybabies they only created more crying. And negativity. I don't think they even desserve. People wanted this! Remember 2014/2015? 
---
So honestly what do players want?
---
I mean yeah, but it's more relevant here
---
[$38 for the full game](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) is the best price you're going to find from any authorized retailer.
---
Yea, BDO comes close to one of the most grindy MMOs ever... graphics and combat and node wars to some extent fun, but progression and RNG in that game one of the most demoralizing mechanics I ever saw in a game. Work hard to acquire stuff, try to upgrade, \*poof\*, reset to crap backups... Ok, time to spend 4-5 hours grinding 10000 mobs in an area for another .002% of a level, armed to the teeth with my combat buffs...
---
Because despite her being fired and the ammount of brigading users from questionable subreddits commenting here when the controversy happened she was one of the main reasons the story content on this game got considerably better and her input about the game's writing can be relevant for the people who might be interested in what's next.
---
Also sort them by colour
---
Skyscale -griffon - skimmer - jackal - warclaw - springer -roller beetle - raptor
---
Bought hundred of cards of Gameivo, they're really reliable but nonetheless, I always pay through PayPal no question asked, they take care of every payment and hell even helped me with issue with double purchase where they gave me money back and dealt the issue with the company.
---
Other than that, your Fashion Wars is pretty strong, what's the shoulder skin called?
---
It's irrelevant to Season 4, being a epilogue of sorts to the PoF storyline more than related to Kralkatorrik in the Mists, even if they occur in similar locales. Same with how Jahai Bluff has some Zomorros and Qadim lore, but the raid has no relation to Jahai Bluffs.
---
I would love this. Not only did it add a whole new element to GW1's story (An almost Goldeneye-esque hunt for challenging bonus objectives), but in general added a whole lot more life to the game, and made its equivalent of GW2's leveling up far more compelling.
---
If I could level my characters in a sort of hard-mode story with my friends, I might actually complete it again on my alts (as opposed to just eating a bunch of level-tomes...). There're some really interesting encounters and gimmicks used in the Personal Story that are just, unfortunately, terribly easy to cheese. I'm not sure if that's a fault of their design or simply a matter of our characters becoming that much more powerful, but it is what it is.
---
I love small-form group content, and Fractals are great, but it's really hard to convince my friends to do them beyond the initial round of dailies. Anything to get people more invested in repeatable, party-scale content is okay with me. 
---
PS: Bring back dungeons! I don't care if you have to build them from the ground up and change them entirely, they had something to them that content like fractals just lacks.
---
&gt; I wouldn't recommend buying the game frome anywhere but the official arena net site.
---
That's nonsense. DLGamer and others are official Arenanet retailers for a reason.
---
had to claim the world first ;)
---
do you think they will follow steam summer sale?
---
I actually have info on this! This was just mordrem concept art, being used for the logo. This was confirmed onset when a couple of artists I know asked about it. It's on one concept artists artstation account but I don't recall the name.
---
oh bro, thanks a lot
---
Its explorer section achi not skyscale collection (you could use this guide for it too)
---
Mayne also some dolyak multi carrying mount
---
If you can link the official retailer list from arena net, that would be great
---
imagine playing pvp/wvw and getting thousands of those mats WHILE having fun
---
&gt; Edit - Looks like JP sent her attack dogs to downvote me. I may be male, but I'm Japanese, so that makes me a minority too!
---
How delusional can you be before thinking that people downvoting you because your comment has less value than the time spent on loading the page are doing so because they were sent by JP?
---
Use free camera and it will never go to initial position after left click-dragging.
---
I think there's a point in-between these two extremes however...
---
Yes, it absolutely should be earned - to simply give away a reward would be silly - but on the other hand, it should be earned by completing compelling new content. Challenges that test your skill with the mount, things like that.
---
I've never felt particularly like I ever *earned* something locked behind a collection in this game, just that I spent a whole hell of a lot of time performing menial, easy tasks. I know, MMOs tend to have a lot of those, but you can absolutely make those menial tasks fun and engaging, whether through exciting encounters, or more abstract rewards such as story beats.
---
&gt; RP elements in the RPG.
---
We need weapons for our pact soldiers in the jungle, give what you can spare. Oh but only 12 each day btw
---
But .. but .. Bubbles is a cute Quaggan you know that right ? Looking cute while [sleeping](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/05/Resting_quaggan_icon.png). Wake him up and you will see the world destryed !
---
Expecting to change what? Sorry, makes no sense to me.
---
It's a baby ship. It'll grow once it gets older, don't you worry.
---
And since that's tagged question rather than a joke/fluff, here's the serious answer: making ships (and other things) smaller than they actually are is a somewhat common trick to make them appear to be further away than they actually are. Games do that forced perspective stuff all the time.
---
I like that idea.
---
I feel like that could cause issues with balancing. I mean okay, there's only one unterwater fractal boss, and rarely any open world underwater content worth doing except for some specific achievements, but I feel that ground combat/weapons do so much more damage than underwater weapons, that it would make some underwater content even more trivial than it already is. (plus erase the need to equip a decent underwater weapon)
---
How easy is it to use the chat function on mobile?
---
I would rather Dhuum tho. But unfortunately there are no known Dhuum statues remains on Tyria. 
---
LUCKILY WE HAVE DHUUM HIMSELF SITTING ON A BENCH AND THAT'S WHAT' MY FAVOURITE POSITION IS 
---
:feelswetman:
---
Hey Optus; Have You Tried Turning It Off And On Again?
---
&gt; Expecting to change what?
---
I never said anything about changing. I asked people what is their thoughs about it. With this rate we will need to farm more then 5000 to finish it all. It is progressing more and more up making it more and more difficult to keep up and enjoy it while the requirements are going up with every another episode.
---
I wanted to check the animation in a video and discovered [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNNYCrkYn3w). At 0:30, the charr needs to harvest nodes one by one, even if they are very close to each other. Bug or intended ? Some nodes are maybe not recognised as identical type already. 
---
Maybe somebody who bought it can confirm this and/or should we ask/send a ticket to the support ?
---
The time gate isn't supposed to be "fun", per se, any more than failing a difficult fight is supposed to be "fun" but it's a way to add tangible worth to something and slow players down a bit. If you look at it as the Skyscale requiring dedication then every single player would need to put forth that effort to get it. Casuals already need to spend at least some of what little time they have working on it day to day, people who can play 16 hours a day need to work on it over a significant period of time instead of a period of ~2 hours.
---
Watchwork skins ? Watchwork  Springer , Raptor and so on ? Well Roller Beetle could be just one big cog wich might be funny . 
---
We do have Wintersday , Helloween skins and maybe some more. Now when Four Winds will be permanent (hopefuly) then we should see some skins right ?
---
&gt;I don't think that she is lying here.
---
TBH, I'm not so sure. Some of the things she says her contradicts her own statements in AFCs before, as well as the last Guild Chat. Though some could be just simple word choice. For example, she says here the Elder Dragons and Six Gods are opposite forces and that was one of the concepts of conflicting magic they were going with, but in what I want to say was the April AFC, she said they're completely unrelated.
---
She says here there were no plans post-Season 4 halfway into S4's development (she says she came in with Eps 1-3 "already in production" which would mean around PoF's release), but by Tom Abernathy's words, they decided to go with a Season 5 when they were starting Episode 3 pre-production (around One Path Ends' release). Got a 2 month discrepancy there, someone's not telling the full truth.
---
Add in that the last time she had tweets about Anet, they started good but ended on a sour man-hating note (this was around the layoffs time) I just can't trust anything she says fully.
---
Best u can have is the Bank —&gt; TP —&gt; Hairstylist.
---
And tbh it’s a game ... if are lucky and got a perm. contract just use it. 
---
If u don’t like it sell it.
---
But collect them and don’t use is a waste.
---
I'm not exactly hardcore, but I will say this approach sucks total ass for the people somewhere in the middle, who mostly perform casual content and choose to every now and then dip their toes into something more 'hardcore'.
---
The only time I ever felt like the game had satisfying, challenging yet casual content was the Queen's Gambit\* (which was coincidentally my favorite thing ever in the game, but that's an aside) - past that, casual content mostly just rewards participation, and maybe following a few simple instructions if you're lucky.
---
It's kind of funny, there's so much casual content in GW2 - probably the most in the genre, but it all feels so samey to me. They've got this amazing combat system and its potential is almost completely wasted.
---
\*- And fractals, the CMs are pretty fun even though I'm horrible at them.
---
there is also the Alloy theme, which is at least a mechanical texture, a bit more model change for it would have been nice.
---
Don't be racist. It's for asura.
---
It looks like armor, not a skin suit. Actually looks better this way.
---
they will definitely have a sale in August during the birthday celebration. they do it every year.
---
That store is like G2A. What quarantee do we have that their seller has acquired the gem card codes in a legit way. There are people banned for buying cards that were originally bought with stolen credit cards.
---
Thanks. Is there a way to track member's might? I've got ARCDps but it's my understanding it only logs against certain bosses in raids. Right now it does display DPS and Healing per min but I'm not seeing a setting for tracking might.
---
I'll keep the VM tools I think. The trophy shipment brings too much
---
In every city there is a [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aesthetician](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aesthetician) where you can preview appearance settings, go there with your armor on and go trough all options :)
---
Thanks for the response. I'll set up as only melee and run some metas as only melee. Maybe I can work through it. It's just weird its almost like I'd expect motion sickness to be. I get a little queezy watching all the movement.
---
Let's be honest, nothing is safe, they even said buy at your own discretion, but what I am saying is I did try and I bought plenty of them and I do mean Plenty, so far it's been a nice service.
---
&gt;  They said 2 hours = 1 Tyrian day.
---
That's the cycle in game between day and night.
---
Turtles are very fast swimmers.
---
I don't have the armor yet 😅
---
But I'm about to create my female Norn character so knowing it in advance would be good.
---
Sorry to get your hope up. I've personally received backlash because of this thread. The thread itself was subject to many, many downvotes, being one of the top Controversial thread right now on this subreddit. (Why? For suggesting deprecated instances be made into gorup content?)
---
Community has clearly spoken. They don't want this feature.  Or at the very least, they really don't deserve it.
---
Spreading 10 minutes over 7 days is still 10 minutes.
---
aw heeeeeeell no. I don't want some noob in a mob that didnt roll out of a red circle blocking my tab when i am switching targets to attack.
---
Don't they already take priority with the action button?
---
Huh. I didn’t know that. I stopped looking at the mount skins when they were put in RNG boxes. I wanted the basic 4 channel skin for the raptor for example. I wasn’t aware they were direct purchase now.
---
Or maybe just a series of gurgle-noises. Because how would you say your name if you're under water?
---
By selling 2 week skyscale rental licenses for 400 gems of course. Oh, and the countdown starts when it’s used and includes out of game time.
---
The RNG version is called "Mount Adoption License" while the non-RNG, select-one version is called "Mount Selection License", as seen for example on the [wiki page for the Exalted Raptor skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted_Gate_Guardian). But as I said, it's 1200 gems for a single selection license, even for the most basic reskins of the RNG package. So it's on you if you're willing to spend that much money on a simple reskin like that.
---
cant wait for my 7th birthday present :D
---
Is this the ship i can find tiny on? I'm sorry, Taimi
---
Oh thanks for clarifying!
---
Congratulations!
---
Yes, jackal is intended design, but the fastest way is indeed to start at temple of Kormir WP, get all the way to the top of the cliffs and just fly over to the top of Sanctum JP.
---
It's part of the secret miniature army that is amassing to murder the large size overlords.
---
No problem. I'm actually working now. Won't be online till around 20:30, but I could definitely use your input whenever you can  =)
---
You need 2 portals for the lazer room skip to be worth your time and cc is not really a problem without a warr.  And does the white mantly one not have a long cooldown?
---
It was for Condi Engineer
---
This sounds awesome though! Thank you.
---
how would you have done it
---
I can't see the training circles or the icon on most maps! Anyone else have this bug?
---
This is not the first, and not the only mention of such changes, but probably best formatted one. So good job there, but i lost you at sloloable radis (i mean some of them already are, but not in same way)
---
Would not be the least bit surprised - especially since pants are often barely visible.
---
Bots can get legandary and you can too.
---
That's the secret lever to open the door to the underground city beneath Divinity's Reach.
---
Thanks for posting, Optus is still not logging into GW2, steam, even netflix is not working. Way to ruin a night
---
Black pls
---
Brutal
---
If you don't play PvP in a party then you need a build that can solo most players up until mid Plat. Don't depend on your team and don't do a support build for them.
---
[Radiant Hammer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Hammer) and [Radiant Greatsword](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Greatsword_(PvP)). I prefer hammer, but I also haven't played it since last season. If your cooldown on Wrath and Intervention are up, you can kill players in a second after Intervention and the weapon swap, if they are not prepared. This takes a person out of the fight and will it make easier for your team. Rinse and repeat. Make sure to just back off if bullying them with the hammer doesn't work and wait until your next burst. Once in plat you actually need to adjust to your team and the meta.
---
Speaking of which, you should play FOTM sPvP builds (Reserve a character slot, delete the character for the next char, etc) or try out other builds since you don't need gear for sPvP. If it works, it works.
---
How do you show your middle finger with that hardware?
---
What doesn't help is that the largos area is one of the toughest on your graphics card of all raid bosses. I'm not sure what's doing it but I can always sense a serious performance drop during the fight that I don't have anywhere else.
---
There's nothing natural about the new map... it was fallen from the mists - so why should it look "natural" fitting into the world?
---
I just wish that anet would release all the specific mount skins like they way they do with the gliders. The mount select licenses are too limited.
---
(I'm just salty cause I want the damn fire pinion)
---
Fair enough
---
im on optus too. its still down for me
---
Yeah, I'd mount that.
---
Meat and cheese between two flour or corn tortillas
---
What do you need the gold for?
---
Sounds spicy,but i figure levelling to 80 must be a chore with only 2 weapons available.
---
&gt;so why has it been three business days and still no update? 
---
Because you are not the only person sending tickets? 
---
They read tickets in the order they come in. And considering we had a rather hyped up release about a week ago, I can imagine plenty of people coming back (or new people joining) that need help from support so might be a bit cramped at the moment.
---
Im new to the game, so i've got a few questions, thanks for your time. 
---
1. Do the Charr hold any areas under occupation, like a human village; if so, are those people treated well? Could collaborators find ranks within the Legions?
---
2. Do the Charr use any race (apart from there own) as auxiliary units?
---
buying pieces of the collections from vendors and the grow lamp recipe
---
Quickness FB builds condi or power? Seems interesting.
---
awesome thanks!
---
Exordii...?
---
There are a number of factors that con be in play here.   
---
If any of the other post about support time that have popped up over the last few days have shown me is that.  
---
Maybe they have a high ticket count and will get to you when they get to you.  
---
Maybe it's something that needs a deal of investigating before anything.  
---
Or any other factor that could lead to a wait.  
---
You've put in a ticket. Which mean at some point it will be handled. Just be patient.
---
I honestly think this is good for people with lower specced PC's so they don't have to draw a bunch of polygons for stuff that's high up in the sky. 
---
Would be nice if they had a higher polygon version for when you got this close though.
---
Is there any of the female Norn body sizes that don't do that? The leanest one maybe?
---
Oh silly you, everyone knows it's just a prop in the sky.
---
*Puts on tinfoil hat*
---
See? The Elder Dragons are but a hoax propagated by the Tyrian military industrial compext, and the destruction of Lion's Arch was an inside job 
---
:|
---
I was just able to log on with optus, it might be fixed now
---
You don't need them, but (imo) you won't really understand what's going on in the story, without playing HoT and LW Season 3 first.
---
It took me 6-7 days to get responce that someone is looking into it and then another 5 days for the admins to solve the problem ? Or something like that. There is just a lot of them thats all. Now they had layoffs wich means less people working on tickets. Yeah you will need to wait a bit longer.
---
Engineer doesn't have only 2 weapons, it has tons. 
---
Bombs, grenades, plasma gun, flamethrower (best farming build), rocket launcher ect. You have ao many skills that you can play with.
---
That's way too uncomfortable, considering I'm used to switch between them very fast.
---
I have them in Shift+ Z-M. But there's only so many keys you can hit fast with that.
---
Moving the hand from over WADS out of the question.
---
Ah, I hadn't seen the gold cost there - just the map materials. Thanks for clearing that up!
---
I wish they would go back and add the new mounts to the old packs we paid for. There wasn't that many packs since mounts were introduced.
---
Guilds totally need a rework.
---
Not sure
---
Yeah. Both elementalist and revenant would look great with double scepters.
---
And thanks to soulbeast we know that repeating a weapon for double-wield is not out of the question.
---
after trait rework daredevil has a bit more of healthpool and an almost baseline damage reduction.
---
Ok, really wanted to know how long others waited. Thanks for this!
---
I'm fine with it. It's a mount almost comparable to the Griff. They also didn't add a big money sink for it, just made you work for it, like people been asking over and over and over. The only people I see bothered by it are the ones in a rush to get it or lazy.
---
A few things to your points, the others I don't really have an opinion on.
---
&gt; 4. Rework of Gamelauncher (QoL)
---
The security aspect is the choice of the user and not the software. I for one don't have my account data stored in plain text somewhere and yet I can login into both of my accounts without any problems with a Batch file. I save the dat file and move them around which IIRC is also possible with an update of launchbuddy. I don't see that as a QoL change, the possibilities are there and the game is for one account only and not for multiple. If you use more than one account then you need to think of a way to access them in a convenient way. 
---
&gt; 5. Raid instance opener (QoL, Raid)
---
I don't really agree on this one. This might be more of a technical limitation than something else. The whole instance resets and not just certain boss encounters so you would need into put every encounter into their own instance to reset them individually. Maybe a different approach would be to allow players to spawn or reset the encounter after a full clear at that location of the boss but not by creating the instance.
---
&gt; 8. Rework of Gift of Exploration (QoL? Feature?)
---
Well, the frustration is because you already did it and if the end result is the same why does it really matter? Exploring the maps got already ridiculously easy because of mounts and gliding and IMO those shards would only take up space you don't really need to "waste" just to give you something in advance. This idea will probably promote that you actually do the less amount of work and with two characters and don't even have to be on a higher level.
---
For example, for the Maguuma area you would only need to be level 70 and Kryta 55 for Bloodtide coast. Which means, your time spent would be even less even with mounts.
---
The Gift of Exploration is, as the name suggests, to explore the world and get an additional reward for completing it to 100% and not just parts of it.
---
&gt; 9. Instance Scaling... (Feature)

I'm split on this. The game is already pretty easy and because it is we get those ideas that content is too hard. You can already see where those dumbed down content leads to, players not being able to dodge, to simply jump an attack or just sitting at the side and pressing 1 to AA the enemy. Now what would happen if you advertise that you can do every content with the minimal amount of effort?! People will get used to the lowest point because why would they work for something.
---
I mean, look at the discussions we have all the time "Content is to hard we need to be able to solo or have easier content" and then we have "content is not rewarding".
---
I can totally understand that if you are handicapped you will have problems but this is still an MMORPG and MMORPGs are NOT singleplayer games. If you don't want to play certain content with other players then that is your choice but we shouldn't reduce a game to the singleplayer experience.
---
&gt; For the veterans out there... when you are thinking back to Gw1... there were a lot more themes of halls for all the orders there... so why not in gw2 too?
---
Guild Halls in GW1 are tiny in comparison so they have more variety. I'm not saying you are wrong and I wish to have more variety but those two things can't be compared because they are different things entirely. Though, I'm all for more Guild Missions, Guild interactions and general representation of Guilds in the world.

&gt; 2. Ranger-Pet Skins (Gemstore)
---
Absolutely not! Not because of the monetization aspect but rather because what that means. You basically will change how certain professions or parts of it are identified. The same goes for Necro. While necro minions are negligible a ranger bet is not because it is an integral part of the profession. Most of the time you need to identify the pet by its appearance alone especially since you can't look at the name. Now, with gemstore skins, you need to learn all those different skins which will make them so much more difficult to identify.
---
Not to mention the additional stress they will do on the other players. Everyone is complaining about flashy skins and the reduced performance already now add mounts and pets to the mix.
---
From I might buy those and the gloves to match to oh that's awful nevermind in two gifs.
---
Uhh, pretty sure the HoT meta's are the most ran in the game aside from the silverwastes.
---
seems to be only partially fixed for me right now cause I can get in but then I have errors after I get in
---
Is it possible to recieve the rewards for story multiple times, with different characters? Didn't know that. Should try that too, still have alot of achievements left to do within the story missions. Thanks ^^
---
You can get a VERY easy 5 Mistonium per character in approx. 1 minute per character by having your LS4 tome/scroll/Spearmarshall's Plea in a shared inventory slot or having Soul's Vendetta Waypoint unlocked by doing the HQ at Pact Vanguard.  Ignore the DERVs,  just hit up the target dummies and you can do the HQ in under 30 seconds.
---
Hint:  You don't have to be level 80 to do any of this...
---
let a man dream.
---
It's worth it for me. I pretty much almost stopped using springer and it covers short distance upward movement that the griffon struggles in gaining height
---
I hate when they make you do a freakin collection for a mount or make you go to a zone that you do not play for warclaw. I havent played the newest episode because it annoys me. At some point i will get it. I would rather then offer paying ten dollars to unlock than charging us more for skin unlocks. Still do not have warclaw either
---
It opens the door to the basement where we will know about the origins of the dragons.
---
Rampage :^)
---
Many of the LS3 maps are indeed low-pop now, but what time and region are you playing that the HoT metas aren't running?  I play NA, usually around 6-10 PM Eastern, and there's always a group running AB, TD, and DS metas.  VB is a little less consistent, but even then, you can usually find a group doing the bosses, even if they aren't trying for T4.  Are you checking the LFG when the main meta events are actually running?
---
As for the hero points, wait until the weekend, and check LFG for a "HP Train".  People still consistently run all the Hero Points on weekends, since you need them for map completion, and thus Gen 2 legendaries. Many trains even take you to the strongboxes too, which is nice because you get some bonus loot and mastery points.
---
So I know the charged quartz and the 250 of the map currencies is part of the challenge. I didn't play for the last 2 years. I bought Living World S4 yesterday and I'm working my way through it. There's some grinding in my future. 
---
It's not the difficulty making me unsure - its the mount itself. Do you see yourself using it, really? My jaunts around Dragonfall haven't sold me on it. So I'm curious how fun you guys are finding it once you can go worldwide with it. (For additional context, I love the griffon races and dorkin around maps exploring more than running meta)
---
Was a suggestion what would rly be consumer friendly.
---
Also: The last two LWS had "free armor skins" as part of the content. :)
---
meh probably not for most players but I'd do it again bc i have enough free time
---
Well you don't need the warclaw if you don't play WvW.
---
Pretty sure it is (the exp and bags of loot at the very least), the primary objective was indeed achievement hunting for me. Especially once I had seen the dialogue once for a sylvari and once for another race.
---
Amen bruddah!
---
&gt; All Scales of difficulty would be percentally - so even on "Easy" - raid wouldn't be soloable.
---
How would you know where to draw the line of the easy setting? There was one player who complained about the difficulty of PoF first mission but what you actively saying is that we need to take players who can't do that content take into account. But how far do we go exactly?
---
I hope you see in what state the Dungeon difficulty are right now, they were damn fucking hard on release and I postponed doing Arah for years because of it. Now they are a joke because players complained about the difficulty.
---
I'm not saying that a reduced or scalable difficulty will make raids a joke but rather make those difficulties also need to be adjusted whenever there is a balance patch. A lot of work for little benefit.
---
Some people want to be able to trade them for BL statuettes directly. It may be too much to make all consumables tradable, but there's definitely a bunch that could use this. And for others there could be some tweaks: 
---
* Consumables that have an everlasting version are useless for those who have the everlasting one, so I'd like to see a new BL NPC that trades them for statuettes at rates between 1:3 and 1:50 depending on the gem value of item and how easy it is to get them for free. Or so you don't need to gather a lot of the consumable to trade it, exchanging them for an intermediate token, then different consumables would give different amounts of that token. The cost of a statuette would be then several of that token, allowing adjusting the trade rates so it isn't 1:1.
---
 * The banker golem from making a new character with Digital Deluxe would not be usable for this (they are already separate items).
---
 * Revive orbs: These would be another exception, these should be changed into a currency, so they are always available on the defeat screen without having to carry them around.
---
* Teleport to friend: Also make them into a currency, and add a teleport panel that we can open with a new button in the minimap toolbar map and/or the upper toolbar.
---
 * Allow unlocking [all teleporting devices](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Portal_Scroll "all scrolls and teleporting devices") in that panel by right clicking them, like the Hall of Monuments portal stone and the home instance portal stone). Teleport to friend  would appear at the top of the teleport panel while you have currency.
---
* Boosters: They already have an NPC to exchange them. But I'd like to have a method to trade time-based boosters for use-based boosters or "augments" that work like the bonus exp from Pools of Reflection in Diablo III.
---
 * Instead working on a fixed timer, augments would have a fixed 'fuel' that is consumed when you trigger, allowing you to sit around with them on without feeling like you are wasting time, they would work mostly like boosters, but they would the server storage of time variable to store the fuel instead. The higher the benefit (e.g.: XP, WXP, rarity of a dropped item for mf boosters), the more of the fuel is consumed. 
---
 * The upside of using augments would be that you would never waste them if have to go afk as their fuel is only consumed when they trigger, the downside would be that they'll give less overall benefits than timed boosters if you were to take advantage of them for the whole duration. Time-based boosters and fuel-based augments would not stack, having both on would count only the timed one until the time runs out.
---
* Skins you already have unlocked: Right click and select a new option to trade them for a Transmutation charge.  
---
 * The skins that are extremely cheap like the wintersday toy weapon skins and those that can be obtained endlessly from vendors for free or a very low price would not get this option either.
---
If you have Lake Doric, killing centaurs non-stop in the leather farm (North East of the map) is popular and very rewarding, both in terms of XP and gold. But yeah those maps are a bit empty especially right now with last episode release.
---
Hero points, most of them in HoT are soloable with some practice, but if you struggle you can also try to find Hero Point trains in LFG, they aren't that uncommon.
---
And do meta events, check the timer in the wiki and go to the maps 15 mins or so before they start.
---
For daily S3 achievs, it can take less than 20 minutes to do the quick ones like :
---
* Bloodstone fen -&gt; jump from ship to get 10 magic while gliding and use the combat skill 5 times while doing so. That's like one minute.
---
* Ember Bay -&gt; Use ley-line to grab 10 magic, maybe do Drake or Karka if there is people around
---
* Bitterfrost -&gt; Defend one bonfire, get 10 magic underwater, gather some berries
---
* Lake Doric -&gt; North of map talk to Oakheart and consume the peach, gather 10 magic around him
---
* Draconis Mons -&gt; gather 5 Orchids, get 10 magic, do the Diver at the beginning of the Jumping Puzzle
---
* Siren's Landing -&gt; Gather 5 pearls, grab 10 magic, do the "/wave" for the Visit a Stranger achiev if it's up
---
Dragon stand with boosters. Ez xp
---
i'd use my credit card so fast i'm embarassed to admit
---
I usually only see one or two DS runs, when I look. I'm living in MEZ (+2) / in Germany
---
Wait appears to be working now.
---
Yeah, well, I am used to the ones from GW1. Even the Primeval boots are smaller in GW2.
---
No. It's weak, clunky, and slow. I'm doing my best to give it a fair go so that I can find situations where it's superior to other options like bunny/griffon switching, but so far I'm just dissatisfied with its low movement speed and ungenerous flight ceiling.
---
Just wait a little bit more for feedback on the skyscale with masteries. A big part of the players are getting theirs the next few days depending on if they already got everything hoarded or not. You can just play normally and hoard stuff in case you decide to go for it.
---
Also, you don't really have to worry about buying them until you hit 80, since they're max-level content. There's not much at all that you can do with lw stuff at your level! Don't worry too much about gold this early!
---
Wel... lol
---
Condi firebrand can also run Sinister gear, since Burning duration is so easy to cap. It's about 1% less single target damage, but much higher aoe.
---
ah thanks, guess i missed that unlock.
---
Does bond of faith not reset the base height for the Skyscale?
---
competent players
---
The adventures, you will get quite good at them after doing them a bunch.  Easy Golds on quite a few, easy silvers on the others.
---
I got nearly all of my exp from the adventures and from doing the story on my alts.
---
Reaper can survive anything that isn't scripted to instant down you
---
Absolutely worth it for me, because I enjoyed the quests along the way. I had something to be excited about, something to focus on, and now I have a new mount that's pretty cute.
---
If you don't personally enjoy the quests, and don't think the Skyscale is something you'll need/use, though, then don't bother. The amount of whining I've heard over the past couple of days about "forced grind" is nauseating. Nobody is *forcing* anybody to do *anything.* It's totally fair for people to decide it's not fun or not worth the trouble -- different strokes for different folks -- but I will never understand why people who think either of those things *insist* on doing it anyway, and *insist* on grinding it out as fast as possible, and then *insist* that ANet is holding a gun to their head and *forcing* them to both get the mount and get it *now*.
---
If you don't want the Skyscale, or the quests make you miserable, then don't worry about getting it. It'll still be there later if you change your mind.
---
If you think you want the Skyscale, but don't enjoy grinding, then don't grind! Just work on it over time, whenever you feel like it. The hard part is over, really. From here on out you just have to feed, kill some mobs, then later do some puzzles and play some games with it. Get the map currencies you'll need as you feel like it, no rush.
---
Thanks for the info.  I habitually use the Plea to get to the Refuge so wasn't aware.
---
Warclaw is basically a worse version of the Raptor:
---
\- Slower
---
\- less jump range
---
\- no CC on attack impact
---
You only use warclaw in WvW, because it is at least a bit faster than just running.
---

---
&gt; The security aspect is the choice of the user and not the software. I for one don't have my account data stored in plain text somewhere and yet I can login into both of my accounts without any problems with a Batch file.
---
There are people with 10+ accounts, i have 5 by myself.  
---
&gt;I save the dat file and move them around which IIRC is also possible with an update of launchbuddy. I don't see that as a QoL change
---
Ofc theres a "workaround" and i using launchbuddy by myself - also wrote my own launcher, doing same as launchbuddy. BUT. Some of the game-options are also stored in this file. Sound-volumes for example.  
---
Launchbuddy places the .dat while starting - but any changes you made on these specific options get lost with the next start of the game.  
---
The .dat does not only contains account-login-information!
---
So can you tell me any reason against a possible "account"-selection inside the launcher? And "there are other ways" isnt a thing if you want it user-friendly.
---
5. 
---
&gt; I don't really agree on this one. This might be more of a technical limitation than something else. The whole instance resets and not just certain boss encounters so you would need into put every encounter into their own instance to reset them individually. 
---
Currently, People look in LFG for an opener, who opens the instance and leave afterwards. Currently instances open always on the last progress state the opener was - but there is no problem at all to open an instance on a specific progress-state.  
---
The only thing what is missing... is a selection for this. So why not letting choose the encounter (as far as you reached this week) instead of having groups searching in LFG for an opener.   
---
SC-Monthly competition April - Cairn CM - i always had to start my alt-account to reopen cairn... was frustating.
---
9. 
---
&gt; I'm split on this. The game is already pretty easy and because it is we get those ideas that content is too hard. 
---
i agree - the game is way too easy - i would more prefer the upscaling of content. would even be fine with only upscaling.   
---
The "easy"-mode was only a word cause for the players really are not able to beat some content - also some stories.  
---
Would be perfect when story is the only thing with "down-scaling"-option, every content meant to beat as group can only scaled upwards.
---
good but too expensive
---
Detha is a really buggy NPC. If something like that happens, try to kill her, port away and back go dying. If nothing helps you can just restart the Dungeon.   
---
And dont bother, Detha wont be fixed. Ever.
---
Why would that make it a chore? Do you regularly swap weapons out on other toons when you level? I don't. I use what I enjoy most and stick with it.
---
Either way, it's selling engie short to say that it only has two weapons. Your kits swap in an entirely new weapon set. You can bomb, grenade, use a flamethrower, etc. and swap them out as you feel like if you're bored.
---
Engineer has the most varied play of any class, IMO.
---
Bo mobs were close enough to kill her unfortunetely. Thx for the info tho.
---
LW season 3 story gives a ton of exp with the boosters on. Otherwise you can do the metas on the lw season 3 maps to get mat and xp at the same time
---
I think you are under the impression that being 80 will make you die less? Gw2 has level scaling so unless you learn to dodge and know when to fight or flight, you will keep dying constantly even in level 1 areas.
---
Anet to fix dungeon recipes
---
Open world pvp events like beta branded kralky
---
You can finish this heart very fast by just talking to the Dredge.
---
I don't disagree. There are levels of acceptable timegates. This is one of them. But it is technically still a timegate.
---
I would like to see some content that required you to run all across the map, gather multiple resources and do several achievements to unlock!
---
Well, yes, but if you play Wintersday content at all, you should have twelve Charged Quartz.  Coming into all this Skyscale stuff, I had 185 Charged Quartz built up over however many years it's been around.  Maybe 30 or 40 of that is from when it was actually introduced and I was manually charging it at hero points, the rest just came from home instance mining, Wintersday gifts and the other sources for it.
---
Mist shard skins for Mounts.
---
Being a strong class and being unchallenging are two entirely different things, though. Have you actually played boon chrono? I personally find it challenging because its priorities are different than most other classes, which requires a shift in mindset that isn't easy for me.
---
Similarly, heal druid is pretty easy as far as rotation and abilities go, but in raids they often have other things to juggle other than just DPS rotation, so that's also challenging for me personally.
---
The open world dialogue is a bit... lacking overall, in all honesty.
---
Ofc, because the dps have to actually dodge something themselves.
---
 Sie sind das Essen und wir sind die Jäger!
---
Most of it isn't too difficult. I do wish I had known about the map currency bits before yesterday though. I find the jahai currency the worst to get tbh even though I'm running that track and have been for a while in both PvP and wvw. Something about that map just doesn't make me want to keep coming back as much as other maps so I'm lacking currency for that.
---
On that though you can buy 5 of each maps currencies per day at the first vendor where you come into dragon stone by spending a tiny bit of magic, so I've started doing that to try and finish the jahai currency..... Then back to square 1 for the last 3 bits of the jahai armour collection. Just when I thought I was nearly done ☹️
---
&gt;And I don't understand why not making it happen all the time. It's just a bunch of dialog to add with some "if" statements. The writers should be aware of that.
---
It's a bit more than that, since every additional bit of line also has to be translated into half a dozen languages or more. And the more conditions there are, the higher the chance of bug is (in Friday's Guild Chat, they even talked about one such bug in one of the camp NPCs' dialogue - Gwen's even, iirc).
---
FYI the LS map currencies are for one of the last collections, so you could work on getting those during earlier steps (especially during the days where you just feed your baby Skyscale) if you don't want to farm it all beforehand. 250 of each sounds like a lot, but it actually goes pretty quickly if you have some alts you can use to complete the hearts repeatedly each day, especially if you can do some events or nodes along the way.
---
Nope, if you first use your griffon and fly for a bit, but then use bond of faith, you end up with a lot less (or negative) flight fuel, because the distance to where you mounted your griffon is greater. That's why I assume it's the griffon mounting point which determines the point of reset, and not the point at which you use bond of faith.
---
Ayin &gt; Dulfy
---
Can we make clear festivals have nothing to do with living world so that number is less but yes the music is good
---
the AP were worth it, but as it stands all the little shit has going for it is being the "shiny new toy" in my collection. it's clunky, it's slow, and its interactions with other masteries is severely limited. and, surprise surprise, it also suffers from the mount load bug.
---
Reaper can solo almost anything. I use mine to solo dungeons, fractals, and champs easily (slowly and methodically, but easily).
---
I find Daredevil more exciting to play, though. It's also capable of soloing many things, but is less forgiving.
---
Anet forcing people to group up. Bring the mmo back into gw2
---
They have *not* released the original set with select licenses, however. If you like a particular skin from that set you're still out of luck.
---
You can mail the items to someone you trust and have them mail it back. Pick up the mail on your other character later.
---
&gt;Eye of the North still has Gwen constantly threatening her allied charr, even at the end of the story.
---
**Pyre Fierceshot:** *"When you set your mind on victory, the  world has no chance but to hear you roar. That is the difference between  a hero... and a corpse."* 
---
**Gwen:** *"The* [*Charr*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr) *is right... this time. I suspect the world has not heard the last of you!"*
---
**Jora:** *"A* [*human*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Human) *agreeing with a Charr? Without insults? Strike me senseless!"*
---
**Vekk:** *"I am amazed they even talk to each other. There may be hope yet."* 
---
They're not exactly threatening each other at the end of the story.
---
Gwen even alludes to her relation to Pyre in the new map with how she has met some charr who are tolerable and consider Rytlock among them.
---
I really just sounds like the Skyscale needs a little rework so this isn't necessary, it's just another drawback at this point if you require another gold-sink mount to use it correctly (and I do have a Griffon,) but this seems tedious to do every time and isn't available to everyone.
---
That's exactly my point. You need a reason to repeat content, this is true for any game. It can be fun, rewarding, requiring some time to succeed before you can move on, artificial timegates, intentionally stretching out gameplay (I.e.having to run through maps,...)
---
The start of gw2 was focussed on producing engaging gameplay in lots of different areas.
---
It took me under 3 weeks to get max level and BiS gear, back then timegated by dungeon rewards. Low compared to any mmorpg at the time.
---
You had no gameplay "stretching" systems like moving goods to banks, running world to world, drawn out and static quests, etc. Gw2 did away with all of these and focussed on gameplay. I'll remind people when teq was revamped most servers couldn't kill teq at all.
---
But under the demands of the gw2 community, most of the engaging gameplay had to go away. The games focus had to be on PvE. And on open world. And everything had to be accessible and easy. No really even easier please. 
---
By the release of HoT everything had to be focused on trivial pve. MUM A PACK OF RAPTORS KILLED ME IN A VIDEOGAME I PAID FOR WTF????
---
Meanwhile rewards had to increase. Remember when this sub spent 5 months demanding buffs to dungeon, hot and fractal rewards, simultaneously demanding difficulty be lowered? And anet did both.
---
Gameplay got mind numbingly boring across the board, as demanded by this sub. Rewards got even more unbalanced between maps and gamemodes and increased, but require no effort, as demanded by this sub.
---
Now the game, to me, is more and more mindless grind for rewards. Engaging gameplay, or requiring social interactions or players or groups to actually TRY and improve before they beat content to prolong its life? 
---
... cant exist because those arent accessible enough.
---
its bugged, free camera doesnt help
---
Turtles can swim about 22 miles per hour, that is not slow by any means.
---
Totally agree! Haven't unlocked it yet but I'l get there!
---
Also funny how everyone are raging about the mount, but no one mentions all the mistborn motes needed for the full new armor collection.
---
Looks better to me honestly.
---
Griffon : *\*staring intensifies\**
---
Dungeons are the main reason for this:  
---
Cause you would also bea able to increase the difficulty. Since the difficulty is percentual - it has never to be changed when balance patches raises.
---
Normal would be the same setting as it is today.
---
Hard would be 200% mob life, 130% mob dmg
---
Expert 320% life, 190% dmg
---
and so on...
---
Adding new mechanics to specific difficulties is optional - fractals do this already! 
---
ok just compare it to fractals
---
Imagine dungeons today are on T1 state.  
---
Adding T2-4 for dungeons with ONLY percentual increased mob-health and mob-damage as said above, would make dungeons way harder - and maybe stop this ignoring everything and just burn the boss to death in notime.
---
Dungeons as it is today is all about skipping and boss-burn... as you do in low-tier fractals.
---
"Easy"-Mode could be \~60% health, 80% damage, 33% loot. I dont know.
---
That's unfortunate :(
---
I don't know, going to 100 different locations and pressing "F" isn't very engaging.  It's also more solo content in an MMO.  They could have at least made the collections more interesting than the same old F-pressing.  At this point collections aren't engaging, they are just tedious.
---
As far as I know it's just pitched an octave down for Rytlock
---
Yes, please
---
i like this dragon it climbing easier than bunny but i agree that it cost too much
---
That’s surprising. I presumed that the most basic were the most common. I’d prefer not to have twenty skimmer skins in a row. Probably best I use the more expensive option to avoid that.
---
If they do a proper GvG, it should be something like a 10 man spvp mode on maps with objectives that are not conquest. This is more like gw1 (8man then) and was highly competitive. Right now the community organized gvgs in wvw are just the players trying to facilitate something that Anet hasn't.
---
These are details, worth discussing and improving.
---
Don't have the mount yet, but with the skill 3 mastery you should be able to dismount mid-air and remount on the griffon from the gliding after that ?
---
[That's](https://imagescdn.juno.co.uk/full/IS451180-01-02-BIG.jpg) the correct hardware for ele
---
I love flying an untrained skyscale in Dragonfall, so I imagine I will enjoy it even more with masteries. 
---
My character can't fly upwards unless there's an updraft. My raptor can't jump long distances and move upwards. My griffon can't fly me upwards. My springer can't cross huge gaps in the ground. My jackal can't jump upwards. 
---
The skyscale can hover while I survey the terrain, or look for a shiny something on the ground. The skyscale can move from one ledge, fly raptor distance to another that's also above where I started.
---
Did I mention it's a dragon?
---
Watchwork human running on fours = jackal.
---
Watchwork human crunched with arms crunched in front = bunny
---
Watchwork human flapping its arms = skyscale and gryffin
---
Watchwork human with tail = raptor
---
Watchwork human lying face down on the ground = mantaray
---
Watchwork human curled into a ball = roller beetle
---
Watchwork human standing up = tonic
---
what? You can't dismount mid-air with the special skill?
---
I never knew this was a thing. Most likely because I never played through the personal story fully with a Sylvari.
---
springer can't cross huge gaps, but raptor can. jackal can't jump upwards, but springer can. griffon can fly upwards, it just takes practice.
---
Not really.  The main reason I even bothered with it was to get my masteries maxed again. lol
---
Is that what you want? Because that's how you get ants.
---
Does this need a post ?NO  there a hundred of post like yours every week can you use search ffs
---
Thanks for the reply. I just gave up yesterday after trying everything I could find online and seeing if I had updates to anything. Oh well, guess it is not meant to be for me to have it again :( .
---
&gt; Since the difficulty is percentual - it has never to be changed when balance patches raises.
---
Not really.
---
The problem with dungeons where two folded.
---
1. They were nerfed because they were to hard
---
2. They got insignificant because of power creep
---
The problem with the power creep is that it only goes upwards as we have seen in the latest years. Even after the dungeon nerf it was pretty hard to solo them but the power creep to professions especially through the elite specs made it the way it is today that they can be played solo.
---
I'm all for making it harder, or giving the option to be harder but making content easier is not the right way to do things. Content, including raids, are fairly easy but require players to spent time with the content and getting to know it.
---
All those mechanics we see today in Dungeons, Fractals or other things are because player found them to be easiest. It is easier to do the no updraft on Gorseval and if you can't do it then you are less optimal. Players will go the way of least resistance.
---
And that is why I said where you draw the line when and for whom it is easy. We don't need to make things easier, we need to encourage that players learn the game.
---
First of all most people never set aside their emotions, so asking them to do so won't really work. But beyond that, I think you're missing a point.
---
This game has often, since launch, made it so that the stuff you need the most is easiest to get. You don't need the mount and therefore the grind is optional.

Tons of people will think it's cool to have a dragon. I like the puzzle solving aspect of it. I like figuring out how to use it to get from one place to another. It doesn't have to be more efficient to be good. Efficiency is not the only point of anything in any game. Most of PvE in this game isn't competitive and you can't really use it in competitive play anyway. So if enough people think it's cool, why should they set aside their emotions and not enjoy something they think is cool. Are you somehow happier than they are by setting aside your emotions. In fact, I don't think you've set aside your own emotions at all.
---
For people who enjoy puzzle solving and sort of idling, there are going to be few mounts more enjoyable than this one. I'm one of those people.
---
You do need all the episodes, you just don't need them _immediately_. One of the last collections requires map currency from all 6 maps.
---
you can't dismount mid-air on any mount.
---
&gt; Because the game doesn't have multiple accounts in mind. 
---
Exactly - thats why i say it needs some changes!  
---
All they have to do is let the user store multiple account-login-informations and select. Not even any logic is needed behind this feature.
---
We have to use third-party software to handle this - we manipulate the official launcher - so best would be the launcher does this by itself - so we dont have to manipulate it.
---
5.  
---
With your argument - no one would be able to do the same boss multiple times a week - no matter what instance he join.  
---
But you can do the same wing several times. If the owner of the instance leave and do not join the actual fight - it not even changes its progress, he dont get the kill - even if he is the owner. He "just" opened the isntance of a specific progress-state, so others can do the boss again. Its almost a no-effort feature to implement. The Instances are DESIGNED to open on a specific progress-state, but you cannot select the state currently.
---
&gt; NO there a hundred of post like yours every week
---
skyscale is only out for a week, though
---
The [Skyscale Lost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_Lost) achievement involves going to 8 jumping puzzles, 10 PoF/LWS4 locations (some being jp like and 1 being a map meta event) and killing 3 bosses (2 being world bosses, so are on multi hour timers), you will be given 1 free food when you start the collection (hence only needing 20 to skip it).
---
In terms of Pros/Cons, it depends on how much you like/dislike things like jps, etc. for me the collection was relatively easy but I do jps quite regularly and have full map completion so getting to each of them was easy and I know skips for several of the jps so didnt even need to do them but I know theres alot of people who find them frustrating so may want to use the item to skip if theres no friendly mesmer around to port them, for me I used my free food on the last of the bosses (the Branded Leyline Anomaly) because it was the last thing i had left so i might aswell not waste it.
---
And yes if you choose to skip them all you will need a total of 42 Charged Quartz Crystal but those last 20 are completely optional and only need to be used if someone either wants to power speed through it or really doesn't want to do jps, metas, bosses and location hunting.
---
&gt; so I can't see myself using the Springer anymore after I get the Skyscale
---
After all these times where I tried to land on a small ledge only to fall further down because rabbit is fat, or got hit on the heas by a small subtle ledge when jumping, I won’t miss the springer.
---
You must have missed the last month of playing as well because Anet gave out episodes 1-4 for free over the last month for anyone that missed them when they were out.  They also put all of LS4 on sale
---
No quest markers after Krytan politics - not sure where to go.  The main story seems to have just ended and it looks like the next story doesn't unlock until level 20. Am I missing something? I'm just not sure where to go from here.
---
Such a concept pleases me.
---
&gt; As someone who watched multiple guild mates bankrupt themselves swapping between magi and minstrel stats while trying to get into raiding (because the douchenozzles "teaching" thought it would be funny to troll them) I have to call BS on ascended really counting as future proofing.
---
I am sorry that your friends got tricked like that, but that is hardly a reasonable case to use as a point of reference - and I can feel pretty confident saying that legendary armour is far more expensive than whatever amount of gold they spent on swapping stats a few times.
---
&gt; Anet loves adding new stats as gold sinks (Viper, Minstrel just as two examples)
---
Do they? They haven't introduced a new expensive statline since those two which was 3.5 years ago. Statlines now are all crafted with new mats which are either account bound or plentiful. A diviner's inscription which is the latest big new stat to come out costs 1g 34s and a few things you gather. A mordant inscription with harriers stats costs 1g to buy off the mp. They don't "love" to do it, they've done it once ever when heart of thorns released.
---
For the record, vipers is not any more expensive than other stats and hasn't been for a long, long time. Even minstrels is really not that expensive any more (10g for inscription), and there are numerous ways around the extra cost of minstrels when crafting, such as using fractal pages so you don't need an inscription or insignia.
---
Her insights are skewed.  She lives in a world where her thought are superior and she does no wrong.  If she likes something, that's fine, but if she doesn't, then she blames it on men and goes off on tangents that she has so much experience.
---
I would say the griffon is better for instant gratification because it is not gated, but has a flat liquid gold requirement (you could cheap out on the skyscale and not buy the items from the tp and save quite a bit of gold). The only time gating is waiting for events to start, and those usually happen within a few hours at most.  
---
The skyscale is good in that it is more involved like the first few gen2 legendary weapons collections, and has optional ways to progress through collections 3 and 4. The timegating is not 100% ideal, but Anet has proven to be listening and have accommodated for the feeding your skyscale step at least. The skyscale collections feel like a love letter/apology for not giving us proper collection-based legendaries since Chuka and Chamapwat, but without nearly as much of the cost as actual legendaries.   
---
To anyone who is not in the instant gratification boat, this is obviously meant to be a prestige mount that is not something just anyone will have at first. Some people just need to chill out and enjoy the game they're playing before complaining that they can't get *everything* right now.
---
&gt; My ascended Berserker Staff from launch is still end game today
---
Quibble: ascended wasn't around at launch, and in fact I distinctly remember a lot of people griping about it when it was released, thinking it was just the start of ANet adding vertical progression. 
---
Those people were wrong, obviously. Again, minor quibble.
---
I've been thinking the same thing! I love that look.
---
&gt; skins? for free?
---
They unlocked the wing gliders for those who bought the wing backpacks.
---
Yeah, I was surprised when I ran into Turai and Dunkoro and they said my spirit was familiar and found out that a lot of people don't have this dialogue. Little details like that fill me with joy.
---
You should. S2 and HoT are basically The Sylvari Story and they get far more flavor than any race before or after.
---
I hope not.
---
relatively new player/refugee from other mmos, so yes I did miss it. until recently i also had school in the last month, final exams and whatnot.
---
Healing stops.
---
Love it
---
1. Play a build that gets kills not a support. 
---
2. Do not rely on anyone else, but yourself to provide downs, win 1v1s, 1v2s, etc.
---
3. Classes that excel at solo queue pug stomping, Rev, Reaper, Holosmith.   
---
I've done this with my main and alt account to get me to Plat 2 with duo queing with friends. I'm happy to queue with you if you are on NA. I have an alt that I can help get you to high levels by duo queing and communicating.
---
No, because everyone has already learned that new armor = needing currency. I mean, comparing the griffon collection to the skyscale collection they're actually pretty similar. Griffon requires gold, skyscale requires time. 
---
I think it's a fair trade off and those who don't want to wait will still have the griffon, those who can't afford the griffon (I know a few) will get the skyscale.
---
Griffon has nothing to worry about IMO.
---
Yes, I definitely want to see this
---
Hey, someone who understands that max speed isn't always directly correlated to how quickly you can get from point A to point B.
---
I'm also looking into Renegade, does heal renegade works fine on fractals tho? also what prefixs are you running on heal Renegade?
---
That looks sick!
---
Even with all the shared slots in the world, saving the click and drags to unequip and re-equip them between each character would be worth 4-800 gems imo.
---
Looking at your username, are you just trolling or what? :D but to your question: skyscale with climbing ability can probably fly higher on a steep cliff than springer can jump, but as a drawback its a little slower to do..
---
Welcome. Best to post in the Guild recruitment subreddit:
---
https://reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/
---
They surely have some good players. Doesn't change the fact that you encounter some others here and there, and it's usually very unpleasant even without any aforementioned "aggressions". It's not like we straight out bully them once we see one. We just started kicking them after having several bad experiences.
---
I've spent $6,000 on gems in about a year and have never been flagged.
---
Ikr it's kind of a smirk face
---
There are still a lot of ppl that don't speak multiple languages and the German GW2 community is pretty big. On multiple occasions I had people ask me for if there were any German guides as they don't speak English well and play their game on the German language setting.
---
I personally like some aspects of the site more than on SC and if there's enough people interested in guides in German, here they are. And if you're lucky enough to speak both languages you just doubled your resources.
---
I'm a bit late to this, but I get the feeling there's more than 5 rifts per area. I found another rift in Wayfarer Foothills that wasn't listed here. It's just north of [Victor's Point](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Victor%27s_Point) past the river waterfall.
---
Now now, child.  You've already been caught with your pants down.  You actually took my arguement for JP's.
---
I did all of the Skyscale Lost missions in a littke over an hour last night. It is NOT worth it to make the food. Use your free one in Vabbi and then you have a bunch of easily done JPs and two regularly done world bosses. So easy.
---
I think I have a weird bug in my game, but the only music I ever hear is the lions arch music?
---
So your'e directly contradicting your earlier claim that she lied about it. Cool. It's hard to keep all your hateful garbage lined up and straight, isn't it?
---
Tyvm! &lt;3 It's the Raven Mantle skin from the gem store, unavailable atm sadly.
---
Skyscales "red bar" should be completely removed imo. The green bar is enough of a limiter. 
---
So, what if you can gain some extra height with dashes or wallclimbing? That's the whole point.
---
Its not like there's any place in any map you couldn't already reach with griffon.
---
It's just extremely polished. It's one of the only MMOs I've never experienced any amount of scuffness. I can run the game at Max graphics and have not stuttered once since I've started playing. If the PvP wasn't completely pointless and lackluster, it'd be the best MMO hands down. I'm also not a huge fan of cash shops in subbed MMOs.
---
But it's 100% worth the sub simply because of how smooth the experience.
---
You were expecting Skyscale, but it was me! Griffon!
---
it cant be a time gate without you being forcibly restricted by time
---
Steve Blum had a naturally sexy voice.  You can make adjustments in production to exaggerate it, but most of Rytlock is just pure vocal talent.
---
If you guys are offended people speak german then just ignore the post and move on, it's not harming anyone. 
---
This seems like a great resource for german players and gj on the hard work!
---
Do the $ prices include taxes if you're located in the EU?
---
I never said that.
---
Was Krytan Politics my level 10 chapter then?
---
In my opinion, if the post is about gw2 in a gw2 subreddit, then it belongs here.
---
It's like a precision platforming helicopter.
---
So how long does it take if I started right now to get the mount? And how much gold?
---
Vielen Dank für das, was ihr für die deutsche gw2 Community macht. Ich persönlich spiele das Spiel zwar lieber auf Englisch und finde einige Begriffe ("Direktschaden Tatendrang Abtrünniger") etwas übertrieben zu übersetzen, da ich die deutschen Begriffe eben nicht kenne, aber trotzdem sehr gute Guides und Informationen auf eurer Seite und im Stream. :)
---
Dolphin sounds so normal.
---
I hope they keep will giving us fantasy creatures.
---
Well the effort of getting the gold to buy the griffon is more. If you already have the gold, Griffon is easier, but it personally took me a few weeks to grind up the gold for Griffon.
---
Skyscale just takes longer
---
*Is that a*
---
**MOTHER FRICKIN JOJO REFERENCE?**
---
Can confirm it works on all tools and you can remove it and put it in any tool you want at any time for free!
---
Yes it does!
---
yeah basically. in terms of mechanical value i would strongly recommend the griffon, it's value is infinite compared to the skyscale's limited use
---
Every time a new meme is born a skyclaw gets its nutrients.

"And if you're lucky enough to speak both languages you just doubled your resources."

I guess you're not lucky enough either :)
---
Heal ren is outstanding in fractals. It's harder and a little more group dependent, because your healing radius is very narrow when you're in Ventari, but the healing is so much higher than druid that it almost doesn't matter. Also it allows you to take a firebrand rather than a chrono. Giving might *and* alacrity *and* healing used to be quite challenging, but with the staff buffs it's kinda trivial.
---
Full Harrier's gear. In raids, if your group needs a tank, you can swap three trinkets to Giver's to overtop 1400 toughness. The breakpoint for full group alacrity is right around 80% boon duration (depending on how much tablet pulsing you do, which is ideally not much). Monk runes are ideal, but water runes are fine and help with the boon duration. Standard healing sigils and food.
---
So now we're shitting on people that are trying to help other people?
---
Definitely do every Octovine you can, the whole event gives close to 400k xp
---
Check your Documents\Guild Wars 2 folder, if it has a folder called "Music" in it, delete that. See: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack
---
It might be something different, but that's the first thing that came to mind
---
Good stuff!
---
Why did you make a throwaway account for this?
---
Adventures are great
---
Oooh maybe that it, I have a special software for my graphic tablet to play osu and it's launch at start so I never close it, my tablet is not always connected to my pc but maybe its because of that.
---
I'll try closing it and I'll give update.
---
Best mount ever:-)
---
Almost all the players who went into making this do know english, but the goal of this is to create a guide for their native language. It's just an extra resource.
---
Hello Reddit
---
It's a new mount.
---
It does what it was advertised to do.
---
Do you want a helicopter mount? Yes? Then get it. No? Then skip it. It's pretty self-explanatory.
---
Me, personally, I got it because I'm a completionist. I also enjoy having access to all content available to me because it gives me the freedom to do whatever I want. So, am I satisfied? Yes!
---
killing enemies is also a daily, and killing someone that's afk is the easiest way to do it.
---
killing enemies is also an ongoing achievement.. so free kills are hard to pass up.
---
Yea, but do you really need ascended gear for fractals? I mean, unless you are doing further tiers, but for first levels of T1 you don't need ascended gear and for later stages I think that asc trinkets are enough for agony resistance, and they are obtainable by fractals currency, laurels or LS maps from previous seasons
---
Nevertheless, GW2 is not punishing players for playing on their own pace, so just enjoy the game and you will eventually get all of the mounts and things you want! :D
---
I'm saying knowing both languages is lucky, read your own damn quote. 
---
Außerdem: Was zum Teufel hast du grade über mich gesagt, du kleine Schlampe? Du solltest wissen, dass ich meine Ausbildung beim GSG9 als Jahrgangsbester abgeschlossen habe, in mehrere Kommandounternehmen gegen Al-Kaida involviert war und über 300 bestätigte Tötungen habe. Ich bin in Gorillakriegsführung ausgebildet und der beste Scharfschütze im deutschen Bundesheer. Du bist für mich nichts als ein weiteres Ziel. Ich werde dich mit einer nie zuvor gesehenen Präzision vom Antliz dieser Welt tilgen, merk dir meine verdammten Worte. Du denkst du könntest hier im Internet so eine Scheiße über mich erzählen und damit durchkommen? Denk lieber nochmal darüber nach, du Wichser. Während wir uns hier unterhalten, habe ich schon mein geheimes Netzwerk aus Spionen kontaktiert und deine IP-Adresse wird grade rückverfolgt, also mach dich besser auf den Sturm gefasst, du Made. Der Sturm, der das erbärmliche kleine Ding, das du als dein "Leben" bezeichnest, auslöschen wird. Du bist verdammt nochmal tot, Junge. Ich könnte jederzeit überall sein, und dich auf über siebenhundert verschiedene Arten töten, nur mit meinen bloßen Händen. Aber ich bin nicht nur im unbewaffneten Kampf ausgebildet, ich habe auch Zugriff auf das Waffenarsenal der Bundeswehr und ich werde es aufs Vollste ausschöpfen, um deinen elendigen Arsch von diesem Kontinent zu blasen, du kleiner Scheißkerl. Wenn du nur gewusst hättest, was für eine apokalyptische Rache dein kleiner "witziger" Kommentar provoziert hat, hättest du vermutlich dein verdammtes Maul gehalten. Aber nein, das hast du nicht hinbekommen, das wolltest du nicht, und jetzt wirst du dafür bezahlen, du verdammter Idiot. Du wirst in meinem Hass ertrinken. Du bist tot, Junge.
---
That's a really nice pitch shifting plugin in that case, I've tried doing that with voices just for fun in a DAW but it sounds like crap
---
Nobody expects the Spanish Icon Griffon
---
WvW is free for all open world pvp zone. Going there expecting enemies ignoring you is pretty arrogant. Calling out those who play the mode the way it's intended to, aka fighting you, is even more arrogant. They CAN leave you alone if they feel like it but they have no obligation of doing so.
---
Griffon : Wrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Griffon is going on holiday.
---
Saying knowing both languages is lucky means you're also saying knowing English is lucky, and nice wall of text in German WeirdChamp
---
Actually they are not. They can farm GoB by doing passive "Big spender" daily or join/create eotm trains. If they actively choose not to take part of the mode to get dedicated reward from it, it's only their fault.
---
My thoughts so far:
---
PROs:
---
* massive amount of AP
---
   * the new map and skyscale collections gave me over 500 APs
---
   * most of the APs are relatively easy to get, just some dedication is needed
---
* a helicopter mount that can hover in the air
---
   * I do not like griffon that much because it's a bit too fast for my liking and hard to land on a precise spot
---
   * I still need to level masteries, but skyscale so far seems to be a bit easier for me to control
---
   * hovering is a great feature for precision landings/take offs
---
   * hovering is great for geographically stupid people like myself: I can stop and check the map without looking for a safe location first
---
* new reasons to revisit maps and regions that I do not normally go to
---
   * people asked for it, people got it
---
* a reminder to do one's daily crafts
---
   * many people were upset with charged quartz crystals requirement, but I think that it is not so bad to remind once in a while that there are some time-gated crafts in this game
---
CONs:
---
*  the skyscale collections
---
   *  unnecessary tedious and extremely repetitive (however, it could've been much worse if more world bosses were needed)
---
   *  excuses for all the collecting are not very convincing; it is really not the best writing or design
---
   * excessive use of similar locations in the early collections
---
   * collections are mostly scavenger hunts, that do not conribute much to the lore or story development; a series of quests probably would be better
---
* time-gating
---
   * time-gating per se is not so bad, but I would prefer if we had to wait a set amount of time rather than for the next reset
---
* the original loss of XP due to a new mastery track
---
   * it was fixed, but those of us who actively worked on achievements lost 2 days worth of XP; it's not a major loss but rather a sign of poor design
---
* the skyscale mount is ugly
---
   * considering the amount of time and effort invested in this mount the default skin could've been much prettier
---
   * makes me wonder if ArenaNet tries to convince me to buy skyscale skins ASAP
---
* overall lack of feeling that the effort invested is proportional to the final reward
---
   * it seems that skyscales will have limited usage, not as situational as beetles, but far from jackal/raptor that are default options for many players
---
   * I keep asking myself if it was worth putting my life on hold to get this mount...
---
Realized yesterday you can use the pvp reward pots to get currencies for all the s4 maps! Thank god I'm a hoarder.
---
You can buy all the items made from charged quartz off the tp as well.
---
I think this is a really cool take! Completely different feeling than the original. It reminds me of some 80s television and gave me flashbacks to [Tomes and Talismans](https://youtu.be/6DzzPDnIKtQ), a public TV show we used to watch in school.
---
&gt;Am I wrong to think that's not very nice of them?
---
Yes. Believing that they are not nice people because you are trying to cheat/game a mode, which you have no interest in playing in aside from the rewards and potentially causing other players to needlessly in queue, is not reasonable in any way.
---
it's generally considered to be bad manners to slaughter someone that makes it clear that they are not interested in fighting through the use of tonics, emotes, and senseless jumping. unfortunately ANets neglect towards the game mode and the following rippling consequences, including the decay of the wvw communities causes such unwritten rules to get more and more forgotten.
---
so bottom line: no, it is not "very nice of them", but it's also their right given the environement.
---
or.. you just have 1-4 stacks of them anyway
---
I see,thanks a bunch.
---
Don't forget the 500 trade contracts. If people never do PoF maps it'll take a bit to get those.
---
Try to get gold on all adventures. You will get chest for doing it for the first time and bonus one which can be done daily.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tendril_Torchers
---
At the bottom of this page you can see how much XP you can get by opening it. First table is for first time chests (so only once) while below is daily chests.
---
I will say it again. Try to get gold on all adventures since they give massive xp.
---
That is how I was able to fully master Skyscale in matter of several minutes since I had plenty Griffon master/expert adventures never done so I got these chests for doing it for the first time + daily one.
---
Yeah I made sure I have all the recipes from the vendor.
---
"I'm sure if I actually experienced this it'd be a huge 'oh shi-' moment but..."
---
We world of warcraft now
---
Eh... I'm not sure. The whole "exhaustion"/"your skyscale can't maintain this height" red bar thing is really annoying. I had been thinking that the wall cling mastery would make it so you could just refill your endurance with no exhaustion, but it still limits you with how high you can go before your skyscale is exhausted. The skyscale is really wonky with updrafts and ley line gliding, too- you hop on it, expecting to have a full green bar, after going up an updraft for extra height, but it's already exhausted and you just start descending. 
---
The collections were interesting and pretty fun, but I think the griffon is a lot more worth it.
---
I don't mind grinding for the currencies. But some sort of heads-up over the weekend when I was passively feeding the thing once a day and then moving on would have been nice so I could spread the grind out more.
---
She was the only one my heartstrings were vulnerable to.
---
You'll lose a lot of health, but with the healing signet you should get your HP back pretty quickly as long as your constantly landing hits. I run a staff/sb DD in open world. I get downed way less than on most classes besides my main (DH).
---
Ofcourse, but every update we get the same group of cryers. It's never right. And so over the top. But game makers do change their courses because of this group. Apparently not always for the best.
---
The way they were talking about it on guildchat before it released, this was the first mount where they designed the mount before type of movement (dragon--&gt;hover/climber instead of high jumper--&gt;springer). So Im sure they already have a bunch of skins on the back burner for it, and Im not mad about that.
---
gotta love the downvotes. you're pretty spot on with your assessment OP, even though you don't seem to have played around with all the potential interactions. even the "afk mid-air away from monsters" niche is instantly rendered moot when a ranged mob is nearby. it has as much of a niche as the warclaw has *in PvE* right now in terms of practical use.
---
that said i fully expect it to receive some tweaks soon™, as that has been thecase with all mounts so far, especially the post launch ones. additionally practical inferiority won't stop people from choosing the skyscale over other options due to subjective reasons.
---
after playing around with it for a bit... i'm simply glad i got some AP out of it, but that's pretty much where my personal appreciation ends with the current state.
---
Turtles are most definitely not slow swimmers.
---
Yeah. The thing is that farming the currencies just gets boring very fast.
---
Btw if this is your art, I love your style!!
---
I luckily had watched the full season 1 movie by then (100% would recommend it), so it wasn't quite as disorienting. Season 2, though, was confusing as fuck.
---
Makes me wish we could play a condensed version of LWS1 (hell, the full version would be better) rather than just watching a cinematic. Doesn't really get you invested in the story. Or, if Anet wants to keep it as a legacy thing, they could do an annual rotation where for a month or so we can play through Season 1 again.
---
&gt; a Canadian road after the spring thaw.
---
This brings me pain.  
---
Also, my personal favorite bit of writing in recent memory was a pack of ghosts coming up with an excuse for why I was immune to a plague that *didn't affect my race in the first place.*
---
If people want to ensure that the raiding community isn't (sometimes rightly) criticized for elitism, toxicity, and inaccessibility, then guides and content in other languages are essential. Thanks LN!
---
Thank you! I wouldn't really consider it "my style" since it's what I'm barely managing on my tiny phone screen, but hopefully I can get it to at least be consistent for the purpose of comics.
---
If you want to farm this then you ppt train
---
Are you sure you can't skyscale into BoF into skyscale to get the same effect. Because this should be a bit easier.
---
As some who did play Season 1, I still don't care about Taimi.
---
*Taimi will remember that*
---
As far as I've seen it explained, they "lost" a lot of the assets somehow. But even just rebuilding or regenerating some of those assets to play through as some new Fractals (I know we have a couple Fractals and a dungeon path if I understand correctly based on LWS1 already but it's very brief at that), or as you said as maybe a "Memorial" two week event to replay some of this content would be great
---
That degenerative condition better hurry the fuck up, I'm sick and tired of Taimi pulling a million deus ex machina out of her ass every episode.
---
People are saying that Jessica's fans cheered when Anet had to lay off 100 people.  That type of thing shouldn't happen.
---
You still need volatile magic, so it's good
---
How would you have gone about it? I'd love to hear some suggestions from these armchair developers on how Anet \*should\* have done the Skyscale to please everyone.
---
Look at your map. Go to the green circle areas. Skewer some branded.
---
Right back at ya with PvE. Why can't I craft a legendary weapon soley in WvW? Why do I have to do map completion?
---
The living season 1 was particular. A big chunk of it wasn't in the format of a story mode. It basically turned a part of Kessex Hills into some kind of dragon stand event.
---
If your supply is truly of no help and isnt willing to supply any support or compensation id strongly recomment taking the  issue to the ombudsman ( [https://www.tio.com.au/](https://www.tio.com.au/) ) since, theres no point in paying for a service that isnt willing to help you meet what youre paying for
---
Bitterfrost Frontier is better if you have access to that map.  Events are popping up constantly at the braziers that you can just run from one to the other until the next Champion spawn during the blizzard.  You can farm it constantly with virtually no downtime.
---
The first problem is you can't even organize anything properly. Social tools are nonexistent in this game. Want to send some mails to a few guildies? Ha ha, good luck. Want to have fun partying with a dumb toy? Too bad there's none.
---
This whole negligence will eventually impact the gem store directly, since one of the major points of fashion wars is bragging or showing off to other people. The less people you interact with, the less you will care about fashion altogether.
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
People are unhappy because they need to revisit the maps to grind hearts (probably the most universally disliked content in the game) and wait around for zerg events to spawn. Instead of say, if the maps were actually fun on their own so that you wanted to play them out of your own will. But nope, players need to be coerced into "playing" because of how unappealing the actual gameplay of the maps are.
---
Level 2 minimum for the plea, so if you're making toons for this, you have to complete the first instance before bailing out and doing the heart
---
It seems you need to learn about inventory managing procedures:
---
1. Deposit all materials ^(click on the cog)
---
2. Sell all the junk ^(on any vendor press the "sell junk" button)
---
3. Open all and any bag or chest
---
4. Repeat~
---
Now you have cleared some space and can be certain of what you have now is somewhat, somehow, valuable. Probably a lot of weapons and armor so decide now what you want to keep.
---
1. Open the trading post, check prices of what you have and decide if you want to sell anything.
---
2. Use a salvage kit on everything else.
---
3. Deposit all materials.
---
That's the basics. Once you git gud you'll learn how to squeeze every penny from your inventory but I don't think that time is now.
---
Scarlet was trained by the Pact. Mordremoth Vines can't break airship beams.
---
They do different jobs. You should compare the springer to the skygate more than the griffon tbh, or a mix of the 2 at most
---
Well, no fee...  
---
You're paying on Paypal's exchange rate.
---
I am thinking a combo of using it on one tool, say pick, and using normal on the rest.
---
Idk imo skyscale is much better for climbing, but griffon is better for actual travel and speed.
---
That's a good shout, can't the Springer jump higher though ? (Just thought, the skyscale will be better for diagonal climbs tbf)
---
I've been trying that for quite some time after making this post, and sometimes the red flight bar disappeared so I wouldn't lose any height, and other times it was still there, but never I regained a full flight bar, which I did with the griffon. I wasn't totally sure what makes it disappear, but I didn't really get consistant results, and once you use it but still have your flight bar negative, you're screwed.
---
The problem with season 1 is that it was designed to be temporary content. The idea was great at that time but they released a new episode every 2 weeks with a long break in between which was not sustainable for either devs nor the players. You felt you had to rush everything so that you don't miss something.
---
Another thing was that most of those things were open world content which would not work well today with all of the power creep.
---
So bringing it back isn't something that would be easy since you basically have to rework everything again to bring it in the episodic form we know today and make all those encounters in some way accessible and beatable with a low number of players. I mean fights like the Marionette or Scarlet's hologram were a pain (but pretty awesome) but designed to be played with a full map over multiple stages.
---
Springer is still the best CC. So it has that going for it I guess.
---
As someone who trys to cheat up things alot griffon is much nicer for doing dodgy stuff than the skyscale
---
Finally some good content.
---
Don't worry, Anet is skittish about killing anyone off after HoT. Taimi will just become an Elder Dragon or something.
---
USD purchases are not exempt from VAT (19% in Germoney), it's just not included in the price like it would when you're buying something in Euros.
---
10USD = 8.96EUR
---
8.96EUR * 1.19 = 10.66EUR
---
0.66EUR more.
---
I second this.
---
I feel like she's gonna wind up putting her consciousness into Scruffy somehow, the same way Blish was transferred to a golem body (F)
---
Compared to a proper story driven rpg, sure, but I still think it's pretty good by mmo standards.
---
Can confirm as of 1:30pm est (22nd may) it's glithced and doesn't count.
---
Same, to my canon commander at least. My RP character, on the other hand....
---
"Gold Sink Mount" its only 250g and you get like 50g a day from fractals wich take about an hour to complete.
---
Spending that little timeinvestment on a Mount shouldn't be a problem.
---
Aquiring the Griffon is supercasual and laidback, you don't need to watch for anything besides the completion and can even buy the items single for 25g...
---
Well, yeah. That's why I'm saying shift the bulk of the rewards to the fun stuff because if people are going to naturally go to the most optimal way to do things, shouldn't that thing actually be fun and engaging?
---
I got really lucky with a weapon drop worth 200g
---
How exactly am I whining?  Anet has a long history of putting the cart before the horse.  Same old shit.  Lets take a look:
---
-full legendary weapon set with collections promised for HOT.  Opps actually didn't even finish until the living story season following the next expansion, and the legendary journey concept canceled after a few weapons.
---
-Fractal leader boards promised with HOT for the third time ever (yes thats right, this concept was promised three times).  Opps, its actually a really stupid concept so we are just gona cancel it.  
---
-6 raids per year.  Opps we meant 1 every year maybe.  
---
So I don't think its unreasonable for me to be annoyed that Anet is yet again, talking about a lofty goal, while they fail to complete their existing "short term" goals in any type of reasonable time line.
---
I mean "lost" and "deleted from hard drives" can mean the same thing. Although no official word from Square, it is commonly assumed that FFVIII has been lost as well. They were moving house and working on 2-3 other games while VIII was in production and they have probably lost enough of the assets that remastering it would be incredibly expensive and time-consuming.
---
Well, if has to be done, then it's time to be done.
---
Depends on how much disposable income you have. $20 is nothing compared to someone that makes 100k+ a year.
---
It was worth it and I enjoy it, but I really hope they make some meaningful changes to the flight ceiling and how long it can stay in the air. the masteries don't really add much to the experience imo.
---
Its actually pretty useful for navigating dragonfall because of how dense the map is(able to get to events easier = more keys). But, for everything else its pretty sub optimal.
---
it'd be nice if it could fly in a straight, horizontal line for longer than a few seconds. I want to be able to "take to the skies" with it, but after a few yards it just falls out of the sky. ITS A DRAGON THAT WE'VE BEEN CHASING ACROSS THE WORLD! why does it just fall out of the sky after flapping its wings a few feet?
---
I don't mind traveling around. It is indeed rather nice. It is just, what am I doing between the time the collection is complete and the next reset? Absolutely nothing. I am not playing. As far as I know, there is nothing to do, nothing I can knowingly prepare for. And now here I am on the saddle collection needing to get map currencies, I could have began working on this days ago, which would have kept me playing, but here we are a week later, and I am frankly bored of this collection crap. I get what they were going for, and I respect that, but they dragged it on a bit too long IMO.
---
Animation bugs are the funniest things now and then.
---
They aint wrong lol
---
obligatory "umm sorry sweaty, but this isn't gvg :^))) "
---
God this will be annoying to see everywhere in 6 months
---
Freut mich, dass ihr wieder die Guides anbietet. Das begrüße ich sehr.
---
Found the burn player
---
To this day i still wonder what the hell it's the point of Rox
---
It's a holdover from the last few GvG tournaments, and it's mostly an honor-type rule. I'll have Roy be the mediator for what is and isn't considered driver sniping.
---
This should be pinned. Didnt touch GW2 for a while, heard about a new mount and was looking for feedback on it. Thank you for saving my time.
---
/r/woodenpotatoes
---
no, guilds work fine.  
---
improvements would be nice, but are not necessary at all.  
---
the cost of rewriting all that could isnt offset by anything short of completely breaking the game, and at this point just shutting down the whole game might be the better choice financially.
---
I used to say that things like this are why we need multiple skin versions or in game sliders that touch on scaling and gear placement.  Those are generally tied to physique choices and modified some by the height slider in a makeover kit, so we don't even need to screw with the gear to fix this.
---
No, this was posted on... err.. /r/funny I think earlier today? Basically, the claim is that the woman in the picture went to the salon to get her nails did-up and allowed the individual to take (and post?) this photo. 
---
OP is on point though. Elementalist could use an extra pinky. Or two.
---
Your screenshot doesn’t look like Dragonfall. The quest only works in the new map
---
A punishment for using SAB minis
---
The Balthazar fight was sooo cool!
---
I liked a lot the touch with Kormir.
---
But they ve done quite well with the Sylvaris in HoT, especially one of the last instances... Where you see your friends as enemies.. And they did it even tho HoT has been rushed. Even your favorite vertue from Ventari has got its own dialog! 
---
For PoF they had their time, more than HoT, but even tho the story didn't make it feel this way. :/
---
I really want them to put more efforts in that, in the future.
---
To add to that, the GW1 prophecies player character runs into her during the pre-searing tutorial zone when she was maybe 8-10?  
---
She survived the searing but was captured and held as "a prisoner of the charr" for several years, though what exactly they used her and other human prisoners for is not spoken of as far as I know.  In a bonus mission pack her escape from captiviy can be played out in game and all we really know is that they were going to have her killed for entertainment.  
---
You run into her again presumably when she's 18 in the Eye of the North expansion.  
---
In the Guild Wars: Beyond mission series you see her relationship with Kieran Thackary (hense Logan's last name) and the story of the Ebon Vanguard's journey that led to the founding of that city is spread throughout the city in game in a series of books.  I assume she eventually died in Ebonhawke, where her tomb is. (A hero point in the city's graveyard)
---
She's not a huge character in the games, but she is one hell of a character over all.
---
dude the rifts omfg, just the worst. The scaling on them is out whack big time.
---
Not sure what is going on but most of the armor in the game is chunky, there hardly any good looking sleek armor. Also, its super hard to find any good medium armor too, I have a hard time finding armor I like for my theif and charr ranger.
---
Idk about that actually. I love my Daredevil, but have felt so useless in raids that I just stopped trying a few months back. It would be best to find a class that you love, yes, but it's better if you love it and it's viable in the game type you're looking for (PUGs will kick you otherwise)
---
Hmm, well I missed Season 1, and I still love Taimi.
---
Nobody is forcing you to do it, you don't have to do it if you don't want the mount 
---
I don't know about you but some of fellow players and myself are enjoying this collection 
---
Griffon was fun too but it was more of gold poring rather than things needed to be done (exploring, collections) when compared to skyscale
---
Back in the day, Duke would get sniped, but he'd have a back up driver, and just call orders through Vent.  I haven't GvG'd in years, so I don't know the current meta where there is no type of sniping, unless Necro bombing doesn't count.
---
&gt; No matter what I do
---
Did you try going into the green circles that signify story? Probably not.
---
Lazarus is part of season 3 and a callback from guild wars prophecies
---
&gt; obligatory
---
"this isn't (GW1-style) GvG!!!!!"
---
obligation accomplished.
---
I think 3 is not enough. 4 would be plausible. Halloween skins were the first one for mounts so it would be nice if second  series started with it. This gives us ~5 months for LS5E1 which could release another mount [if](#s "we are truly focusing on DSD, so underwater mount is necessary").
---
Y I K E S. 
---
Okay, I just saw it when I went to feed my skyscale for today. I did have it in my inventory. And yeah, I did expect a popup, but I guess I should've read the collection description properly. Lesson learned :^)
---
Many thanks.
---
Well obviously. Copy-pasting is cheaper.
---
Ive started that bounty yesterday two times for guys from my guild as they've been asking for help there, in map chat, for hours. One of them for two days. You can make nice group in like 10 min for it (at least i managed both times), but i do remember time when ppl been actually waiting for leg facet to respawn on the board. :)
---
Well it was but more 'oh shi-, not her AGAIN!'
---
As someone who played at launch and season 1.... yeah it is just a mess that everyone afterwards missed out. Dragon's Watch feels forced upon you.
---
Mate I'd love to join you unfortunately I don't have time to play much currently. Best of luck in your quest !
---
I’ve been salvaging without opening my blue and greens. So I should definitely start opening them? Just seems like it would take forever tho because I get like 100 per day
---
I'm honestly okay if they copy paste rigs.  Means we get more new content.
---
but it has a new flying and idle animation
---
I agree on this, the zephyrite aesthetic is so nice
---
Certainly true - and my own precise problem with Engi. Rotations always feel like they're reduced to "Swap to package A, use one skill. Swap to package B, use one skill. Swap..." and so on. Having said that - it certainly gives you heaps of situational stuff you can then fall back on; I certainly wouldn't pass it up on that basis.
---
I just hope it get's a buff..
---
There are dungeons pros that still pug dungeons, if you pug everyday you will meet them eventually, best you ask them to tag along on your dungeoneer endeaver. Most people in running dungeons are complete noobs, quits after 2 tries, never listen to instructions, when things go south they attack the person in charge.
---
Dragonfall from what I've been seeing.
---
I go back and progress a sub-80 a bit when I'm feeling bored of other stuff. It doesn't take all that long if you kill mobs and have the right buffs.
---
In order to prevent clipping, what you need to do is tell the leggings not to draw the lower polygons when wearing tall boots.
---
It's a very common video game thing.
---
GW2 only does it in rare and random occasions though, for some reason.
---
How can you call the Griffin collection "instant gratification" just because it's not timegated? That collection is still damn long and even has some unique instances associated with it. It's easily my favorite part of the expansion and nothing about it was "instant". People act like the griffon collection consists only of dumping 250g at some vendors and then you have it. But hey, if you think timegating is good because it delays gratification (a tactic mobile games use to keep people logging in) then all the power to you.
---
That you STILL need to do one more achievement after the entire saddle step is just hilarious. Like after everything you've gone through to get to that point, they still couldn't resist moving the goal post again.
---
Hey, for some people it's a flying cat
---
...where did that happen this episode?
---
Or last?
---
I saw some reports of a bug where if you mash that feed treat button and have alacrity it's possible to go faster than it gives credit for the achievement and your account is locked from getting the drop again.
---
Otherwise, for anyone else that isn't sure if they got the drop or not, I would recommend using something like [gw2efficiency's overview](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/overview) to search your account / all of your characters for the item rather than switching between each in-game.
---
I think she really toes the line between annoying/endearing. I just started the PoF and the prologue has Kiel talking about Taimi's "superiority complex" so it's definitely the way the writers intended for her to be written.
---
I mean, she's Asura—which is bad enough—and then she's a Dexter-type prodigy *on top of that*. Not surprising that she gets on people's nerves, but I think she has her cute moments as well.
---
[What more do they want?](https://i.imgur.com/j4PLhew.png)
---
I missed season 1 and admittedly laughed when I finally heard about her condition because I thought they'd never kill off this character... Am I a bad person?
---
...Three of those are legendary my dude, the mount isn't, that's the huge difference.
---
How u get so high up?
---
I think there will be a lot of ppl for at least next couple of weeks, probably even more. :)
---
I just started LW s4, so i quite like the thing that all those maps are packed. I enjoy them much more like this. Even that i can understand why ppl are complaining...
---
You can gamble them.... But it will cost literally everything... &gt;.&lt;
---
if you are expecting to get something as soon as humanly possible, you should also expect that it will take insane amounts of grind in a short time
---
&gt; How other RPGs handle such things then if it was that hard? GW1 did it well already with some flavor text in quest. So did other great RPGs. 
---
GW1 didn't have many conditions in the text, just a handful of variables for primary profession and character name.
---
GW2 could do a better job, definitely, and the fact that the only line change for humans was if they were blessed by Balthazar or Kormir (and ONE line each at that) was definitely bad, but the camp NPCs already had a ton of conditions applied to them based on progress of the meta, so in those cases it makes sense that it's not there.
---
Eh, of the thirty odd Season 1 releases, maybe 5 of them were good.
---
Most were trash but people choose to remember the good ones.
---
The original update gave us 4 lines of dialog and signs to pree F on and that *was it*. You're not missing out by not being able to play that.
---
I'm pretty sure this subreddit spends more time putting words in Anet's mouth than it does playing Guild Wars 2.
---
right, the mount doesn't really add to much to the gameplay the other mounts can't do already lol.
---
If you measure gold spent vs time saved this is a horrible trade. I would recommend using the free treat in Vabbi so you can dodge the boss fight but otherwise you can wrap up the whole collection in about an hour. One of the required JPs is even a daily today so it's got a mesmer on it at all times. The hardest JP to do may be the one in Lornar's but since you just need to get across the path and don't need the bomb it's a lot easier.
---
AND YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY GOLD FOR ALL THIS? Absurd
---
I wouldn't mind joining you working on this, I'm a bit rusty on dungeons so it might take me a a couple runs to get back in the swing. Im pretty regular with daily t4s so I can handle dungeons without too much trouble. It'd be a great excuse to tackle some of the lanes I never got around to because of lack of people.
---
I am an English speaker certified with near-native proficiency, and I still deem this a great offer that a lot of people can benefit from - including me. Whether or not English is your native language, don't be a prick about people using theirs.
---
Nothing, you can't reach 100th percentile since you can't be better than all players. Other players will also have 100% uptime, so you can't be in a higher percentile than those people
---
I strongly recommend just doing the jumping puzzles, especially at this point when there are tons of players active in them. If you absolutely hate JPs / don't want to do anything that take more than 5 minutes and takes a bit of effort, use the skip for the following:
---
* (JP) Goemm's Lab in Metrica Province
---
* (JP) Griffonrook Run in Lornar's Pass 
---
 * *Note: this one takes like 4min if you know the way or are using TacO markers to complete it*
---
* (JP) Coddler's Cove in Timberline Falls 
---
* (JP) Sanctum of Nabkha portals in Crystal Oasis 
---
 * *Note: You can griffon ride to this place from the pyramid as well. If you don't have a griffon, I made a video guide on how to cheese this thing super quick so please don't gold sink yourself on food :( [YouTube](https://youtu.be/QenOxw8bsQg)*
---
* (EVENT) Hall of Ascension in Elon Riverlands
---
* (EVENT) Branded Ley-Line Anomaly in Domain of Vabbi
---
Out of all of these, those last two events are the only ones I would actually recommend using the food for. They're not on timers and are really annoying to wait on.
---
If they had explained that this was basically the end of season reward rather than something you got from episode 6 people might not have complained. Hell, then people would have known you were going to need all the mats before the final step so they could gather them during the time-gated portions. Instead, they bumbled up something that could have been cool by failing to communicate what it actually was.
---
What's the difference other than a title?
---
No. She was an annoying overused plot device in Seasons 2 and 3.
---
She was also very childish in Season 1 with her fanatic fanboying over Scarlet who was a very poorly written character.
---
I still wish Season 1 was permanent though, despite how poorly written it was.
---
I've had 100th percentile on other things before. In any case, how does that make sense? 100.0% is *the* best achievable.
---
Well, she can't walk (for lengthy periods of time) and can't run, so it's not inaccurate.
---
It's certainly a cool idea that would add replayability, and challenge, to releases, but I'm not holding out hope that it'll ever happen.  The fact that we haven't got one since Hearts and Minds, leads me to believe that the number of people who ran them must have been pretty small, enough to where Anet must feel it isn't worth the development time anymore.  Maybe with the increased resources going into the game now, we'll see their return, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Glad to see such initiatives. Over the past few days, I've been running TA to gear up my condi soulbeast and I've met incredibly toxic new players (around 1k ap).
---
Group today had 2 players just constantly berating and trying to votekick another player for being unfamiliar (e.g. not skipping trash efficiently and accidentally breaking stealth).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Wish there was vote mute button during dungeons lol.
---
41 GOLD!? ANET DO YOU THINK THIS STUFF GROWS ON TREES???
---
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!
---
If you're complaining about the TP costs, the price has already fallen over 100G in less than 1 day after the first people unlocked their skyscales. It's steadily declining from there as well, not to mention that the most expensive part is *completely optional* if you absolutely hate jumping puzzles.
---
*Too late you're already invested*
---
Taimi is kind of Trahearne 2.0 in that she's a pretty great character people keep throwing hate at for no reason
---
I think I've seen a Bavarian translation of that copypasta in r/de. But the best experience is finding an intentionally mistranslated meme or sentence and having no idea what it originally meant.
---
The irony is that this wasn't the case in Season 1, and ArenaNet originally planned to kill Marjory off at the end of it, but players loved her introduction so much that they scrapped that plan. Ironically, she quickly became disliked for exactly what you point out: the two suck at relationship communication skills.
---
This may just be me being way too many years out of a math class, but I think that's just how high a percentile goes? You're at the very top, the literal 1%. You're higher than 99% of the population, therefor you are in the 99th percentile. Being in the "100th percentile" would mean you are higher than 100% of the population, and you are obviously not higher than yourself.
---
Hidden Achievement complete: Kneading Dough
---
Title unlocked: Pervert
---
I feeeel this lol Ive always been max mastery it feels weird to not go for them
---
Exodia
---
I remember hearing that they add low growls and a lower octave version of the voice under the actual voice. It's subtle but works.
---
&gt; Treats do NOT have a daily limit. Spoil that thing rotten on the first day if you want to.
---
Careful with this step. A few people have complained that they spammed multiple treats too fast and didn't get credit for all of them. Probably best to feed one and wait until the achievement progress popup appears before continuing if you've got multiple treats in your inventory. If you do lose a treat then you can go grind for it again.
---
Great comprehensive guide! I only noticed a couple of errors:
---
- Shadow Behemoth and Golem Mark II do not always happen consecutively. It's true that they're next to each other on the schedule for their first occurrence after reset, but they have different respawn times and only line up like this every 6 hours.
---
- I'm 99% sure Branded Leyline Anomaly has no cooldown. It should respawn whenever the chest is interacted with (I auto-pilot opened the chest just after killing it last night and accidentally spawned another one, much to the horror of the nearby players).
---
ty
---
What's season 2 &amp; HoT like as a Sylvari? Does anyone question your lovalty. Is anything different?
---
Please tell me in due time you'll be making a comic about this lol
---
The new meta shits out gold, the gold doesn't even register as an issue.
---
Season 2 feels more personal as sylvari in that a lot of the story points affect the sylvari race. HoT is a COMPLETELY different ride as a sylvari with an extra layer of spookiness and tense bits that I absolutely preferred.
---
Yes, i think the same...
---
Same reason they're upset at the skyscale requiring 250 of each map currencies.
---
Yeah, I think if Anet had a more fleshed out plan for LS1, so that each episode delivered a substantial chunk of permanent content, in addition to the limited open-world stuff, it would have gone over a lot better, because the actual ideas were really cool, IMO.  The Molten Alliance dungeon, the Tower of Nightmares, the Marionette, and Escape from LA, all were really fun.  
---
But once a given chapter ended, there was just...nothing. A single new dungeon path (that replaced an old one), a handful of new dynamic events, and some cosmetic changes to a few zones, are all that remains of the season. They stated at one point, that one of their goals was to deliver an experience that would leave newer players wondering, "what happened?" while older players waxed poetic about the times of Tyria past, but instead, unless a new/returning player went to LA or Kessex hills, it's far more likely they'd ask, "So, did anything happen?" and that's a real shame.
---
“Praise be!”
---
Imagine complaining about having to spend 41g lol you ~~probably~~ earn more than that just by playing to get the map currencies that are required
---
"Reach incredible heights"  
---
Griffon:Hold my beer
---
Gratz on the mount! :D Now what this mount is useful is to show off.
---
Incels?  4 hours ago, you called Jessica's followers "queer leftists".
---
Good point on the Behemoth/Golem, though as far as I know it never happens in the reverse.
---
As for the Branded Anom... I have seen maps waiting for him for &gt;30 min, &gt;60 min, and still get nothing. If nothing else, it's bugged out for now and I would still advise skipping it if you're not able to get it going.
---
If Anet doesn't bring back Season 1 anyhow, then they shouldn't forcefeed Scarlet down out throats like in the Domain of the Lost, anywhere outside of Season 2. 
---
They could leave it legacy and remove its relevance from current affairs; make it hidden for accounts that didn't play Season 1, OR grant access to all players in a playable recap and keep her relevant to the player character.
---
Yeah that's a very fair point, it is nice to be an older player and remembering these huge open world events. The fact that almost all trace of them is gone as well as the introduction of all of the major LS players is frustrating.
---
a harrier healer FB allows lots of mistakes
---
chrono support, i think it's effective for a static group and you have most boons needed
---
druid. not bad to have the 5% dmg and then might stacks and heals
---
Yeah I get it. I just really enjoy achievement hunting in this game myself.
---
Don't you need all the S2 achievements to unlock the luminescent set? That's nice armor.
---
I think one of them is not that long. One of the other three that is not p4.
---
I don't have a lot of time to play to rake in the gold. I've got a paltry 23 gold in my bank.
---
Hey, thanks for sharing your thoughts. HoT has some very intriguing narrative moments and I'd consider it a diamond in the rough which unfortunately fell victim to a tight schedule when the expansion could've used one more year of work to polish some of the map and story instance stuff to fit their original vision of it.
---
As for your questions:

1) Rata Novus could've definitely played a bigger role given its significance in the story (and its discoveries somehow leading to the jarring moment where the Commander realizes Mordremoth's weakness out of the blue), but there are some interesting lore hints in the city if you do the optional objectives like finding the hidden notes scattered around the area etc. Some of the lore hints that the city's defenses may have been sabotaged from the inside and if so, it would be intriguing if the writers ever retroactively tied that possibility to the reuse of Inquest tile assets in Novus architecture and reveal that one of the members of Zinn's council could've been the founder (or one of the founders) of the Inquest who wanted to get rid of Zinn and the co-councillors by deliberately speeding up the city's downfall and later taking Zinn's symbol as the symbol of the Inquest megakrewe. Could be a nice lead-in to any future Primordus/asura expansion, especially if that founder lived on as a digitized consciousness in a computer network deep within the Inquest's hidden headquarters (which was teased in a certain optional console dialogue in S4) somewhere out there. :)
---
2) Wyld Hunts are a tricky thing. Most sylvari don't have Wyld Hunts, and it's rare to have Wyld Hunts being tied to Elder Dragons, even less so for two sylvari to essentially share the same Wyld Hunt as Caithe and the sylvari Commander apparently did. Whereas sylvari Commander's Wyld Hunt seemed to be less about Zhaitan per se and more about ensuring the downfall of all Elder Dragons (as the Wyld Hunt "reactivated" once Mordremoth became a threat), Caithe may have either misinterpreted her original Wyld Hunt as kill Elder Dragons instead of it being "pave way to protect Aurene from harm from her rivals by any means necessary" or then she really did receive another proper Wyld Hunt as the story leaves it somewhat ambiguous.
---
What makes it more complex, however, is that Mordremoth apparently became aware of Caithe's Wyld Hunt and abused his connection to the Dream to send Caithe mixed signals, fueling her desire to protect the egg and sow seeds of mistrust as she wasn't sure who to trust and thus she "betrayed" the Commander by taking the egg, as Caithe explains in Season 3 episodes. It's possible that the Pale Tree had foreseen Caithe's role tied to the egg (as she was already aware of Tarir and the egg as per the vision she showed the Commander) but she couldn't foresee Mordremoth twisting that Hunt into fooling Caithe to deliver the egg to him instead, which would explain the Pale Tree's confusion when we told him that Caithe had left with the egg when the Commander was meant to bear it.
---
What's another intriguing thing about the Wyld Hunt is that sometimes sylvari can misinterpret their Wyld Hunt. So you think the Hunt is about something when it's actually about something else, but you don't necessarily realize it until that strange itching feeling returns and you feel that you're missing something. This concept hasn't sadly been explored that much in the story, but it opens up possible future plot avenues if we ever explore the origins and true reason for the existence of Dream and Nightmare and why even some non-sylvari like the White Stag are part of it and if it's tied to the "soul" of Tyria somehow.
---
3) It was to give us a semblance of choice, which they promoted HoT with but sadly had to cut many of these choices from most missions due to tight schedule. I recall a dev mentioning that more people saved Logan and Zojja although I'm not sure if they would've used these statistics similar to Evon and Ellen voting to decide on which character would become more prominent in future storylines based on the Commanderr's choice or not. My gut feeling would say that there's no correlation, but it's interesting to think about nevertheless. I also thought it was a nice, dark touch how Zojja's clones beg to be killed, revealing that she had bigger mental resistance than Logan did.
---
4) That chase was indeed fun whenever it wasn't bugging out for me. The instance truly made Faolain a terrifying creature, magnifying her villainy tenfold and revealing the twisted machinations of Mordremoth. Part of me still wishes that Faolain hadn't been corrupted so early in the story as I wanted to see her take her role from Edge of Destiny and become a reluctant ally as we both care about the same person: Faolain. Who better to track Caithe than her ex who knows her intimately, and imagine Faolain attempting to convert Canach and sylvari Commander to Nightmare with some juicy back and forth between them while we explore what makes Nightmare different from Mordremoth's corruption.
---
5) The cutscene vision Aurene shows us in Tarir after placing the egg in the chamber reveals a disturbing image of Mordremoth planning to clone an army of improved Mordrem 2.0 via using Trahearne, Logan and Zojja as templates and unleash them on what seems to be Divinity's Reach. He might've wanted to use it to also demoralize the Pact, turning their greatest heroes into their greatest enemies. Perhaps it was also symbolic revenge for us killing the Mordremoth-influenced Toxic Hybrid (aka Ensolyss if the fractal name is canon for the hybrid), the first of the Mordrem firstborn from the Tower of Nightmares in Season 1, so corrupting the first of the firstborn from the Pale Tree would be a nice way for the circle to be complete. I imagine the devs may have had more ideas for the Mordy-Trahearne connection beyond it offering us a convenient way to enter the Dream with Trahearne acting as an extension of the Heart of Thorns, but sadly it was likely one of the victims of the plot cut short due to sheculing conflicts.
---
6) The "potato" is just an avatar Mordremoth's mind conjures to fight us mano y mano with the real Mordremoth being the transcended shadowy faces that watch our struggle from the sidelines. He apparently wanted to pummel us to the ground as the fight was personal to him; his true shadowy form would've been unable to fight us via traditional means. Why Mordy specifically chose that look instead of a slimmer, more muscular figure when he had more or less unlimited power in the Dream realm to choose whichever form he preferred, is sadly unknown to all but Mordy himself.
---
I did feel something when Trahearne died although I was one of those players who started out as a sylvari so this whole expansion felt very personal to me. The added commentary, and understanding Mordremoth in earlier missions, gave the expansion a nice touch and were a visceral reminder of the terror the sylvari and their allies were going through as more and more sylvari succumbed to Mordremoth's siren song. I do wish there had been more scenes with Trahearne somehow to make the death even more impactful, perhaps so that we save Trahearne but Mordy doesn't immediately reveal his last seed being inside the marshal so we only learn it at a later moment and have to kill Trahearne ourselves in a true final battle but that would've required extending the storyline beyond what they had the time for. I also feel the expansion needed more than the post-battle dialogues inside Heart of Thorns tree, maybe a proper Pact memorial for Trahearne given that for most players Trahearne would've been a closer friend than Eir who received a better memorial than he did.
---
To add to the above, yes, I highly recommend playing through HoT as a sylvari. The missions remain mostly the same but there are some neat added moments and dialogue here and there (particularly one chilling moment in "Bitter Harvest" with the Mordrem Guard which I wish they'd extended as that was a genuine WTF reaization in a wonderful way) and you actually understand Mordremoth's whispers and roars throughout the campaign. If you stop personal story before joining any of the three orders and enter HoT, the mentor battle in the Dream is replaced by Trahearne, so you can use that as an additional reason for a playthrough. I wish my sylvari had chosen Priory to get Sieran as the mentor boss as it would've been heartwarming to hear Blighted Sieran and sylvari Commander's familiar greetings once we free "Sieran" from Mordy's control.
---
Also, be sure to play through the side story called Knight of the Thorn after finishing HoT story once you get mail in your inbox. The knight storyline ties up some loose ends and is what I consider the proper epilogue to HoT as it deals with Caladbolg's fate and the pasts of its previous wielders (it's even more impactful if you've played through Chapter 3 of sylvari personal story so you understand the significance of Caladbolg's troubled past), culminating in a final boss that is very personal with lovely storybook-like narration throughout the mini instances which I've interpreted as Caladbolg speaking into your mind. :)
---
But not if they have been seen like everyday :D
---
Done 6 today and gave 2 more people gryphon money. I have a Storm precursor in my bank i will add that into the rotation as well but want to give that to someone who wants to make meterorlogicus or whatever its called.
---
Thank you for sharing that
---
*tfw that wasn't the intended meaning of the title whoops*
---
I think you are looking for a reason to bail on it since you feel the pressure to have it but you don't like the collections and time gating it involves. There was already a post detailing how you aren't missing anything if you don't have it since it's basically Griffon + Springer, so if you really are on the fence about having it then don't.
---
I can only suggest to look at it in another way: You don't have too much time to play so you probably repeat the same content. Maybe the collections time gate can give you some diversity on stuff to do.
---
It's hit and miss. With groups of 50, it's almost not worth doing if you're not a specific farming build. 30-40 is the sweet spot. 
---
If I'm running as commander, I often skip it after the first time round, if I'm honest. I think 90% of its status is because it's convenient.
---
Also I’d encourage farming the Living World Season 4 maps for their respective currencies while you’re waiting for the daily time gate! I suppose this won’t be applicable once they make the time gate only 2 hours next Tuesday
---
yeah, but the saddle is not a time gate because the only limiting factor is your own dedication and if you already have a lot of characters which let's be real, everyone who plays this game a lot has dozens of maxed characters
---
The horror.  ;\^)
---
I just wish the Skyscale felt like an actual legendary mount. Everyone who has it says that it wasn’t worth the trouble, even with the mastery. You got the mount but at what cost?
---
That's what peak performance looks like, the apex of gaming evolution!
---
A standard speed run makes an entire tour of at least 8 paths take 45 minutes if not less.
---
**YES YES YES YES YES!!**
---
The Skyscale is an absolutely fantastic mount. SO comfortable and easy to traverse any type of terrain. Its not a speed mount, its a traversing mount, able to clamber up any damned thing imaginable. Moving around with the Skyscale is extremely forgiving. I'm klutzy and the Skyscale is the ultimate anti-klutz mount!
---
The hover capabilities allows you to inch your way very easily to your objective. I'm finally able to collect every floating bit of Unbound and Volatile magic out there. And I love scooching up to the new rifts, and collecting the shinies to the end of the path.
---
Also, there's a rather nice bonus of being able to get high above the mobs which allows you to not have to aggro everything nearby when you just want to do your own thing and not be in combat constantly.
---
I'm truly beyond thrilled with this mount. It was absolutely worth it! :D
---
500 AP? Holy shit
---
Is it really moving a goalpost if that's how it was designed from the start?
---
I get that the collection feels really arduous for what is a very underwhelming mount (*[AND](#s "STILL NO LEGENDARY TRINKET REEEEEEEEEEEEEE")*), that it felt really dragged out, but at the same time, if you're big on lore / immersion design:
---
You discover a new species, but there's no time to learn more about them because Kralkatorrik is still an end-of-the-world threat. You haphazardly figure out how to use them within the greater context of defeating Kralk and then continue to plug toward that goal. And yes, even though they're totally unnecessary if you have a griffon or LS3E5 masteries, it's a solution which works within this independent episode.
---
After that big threat is dealt with, Gorrik, who specializes in this sort of thing as introduced in LS4E2 and expanded in LS4E3, begins his investigation on this species. Turns out there's some complications and more data is needed on them. They're demonstrating symptoms of a sickness experienced by other reptilia, so Gorrik wants to determine just what's going on.
---
Gorrik's hunch was on the mark and he proceeds to concoct some medicine to treat the symptoms, but because this is all new territory the best he can make are educated guesses as to what is going on and what needs to be done (if anything needs to be done at all). What he thought was some kind of disease was actually an accelerated aging process. With this new insight, your target is changed: collect the eggs to ensure a second generation survives long enough to continue growing the population.
---
Quick version for the rest:
---
* Figuring out how to hatching eggs of a magic-born species and how to nurture them
---
* Hatching and caring for the newborn
---
* Domestication
---
* Figuring out a way to actually mount this thing safely
---
* Bonding with the skyscale and...
---
* Taking the first steps to introduce a potentially cataclysmic event across Tyria in the aftermath of your battle with Kralkatorrik: Reality Rifts
---
***
---
Personally I don't care for all the immersion stuff. I am never a fan of immersion at the cost of gameplay and I rarely care about the story in games unless it is seamless with the gameplay.
---
At the same time, I can appreciate all of these belabored steps. The reality rifts is planted so casually at the end of all of this that it seems like a minor / unimportant thing, but I expect it's a seed planted to gear us toward the next season.
---
Doesn't the vendor sell the upgraded variant that requires the base variant to unlock? It's pretty consistent with "upgraded" armor pieces. WvW does something similar.
---
It sells the skin of the upgraded variant only if you have the basic version. So you are buying the upgraded version of the set you picked from the achievs.
---
I’ll do my best to be patient.
---
You get the base variant of the armor from the War Eternal Achievements. 
---
Once you unlock the base skins, the vendor will offer you the purchase of the /upgraded variants of those skins/, which are more intricate, spiky, and flashy.
---
So the vendor does not sell you skins that you already have. :)
---
250 kralkatite (NPC) = 3,2 gold
---
difluorite, inscribed shards, mistonium, branded mass, mistborn note = 250 each @ 20 VM per.
---
Total = 5*250*20 = 25.000 Volatile Magic.
---
25k VM = 117,5 gold.
---
So you are looking at 120g. It's not "OMG so much money" but i bet for many people it's some money.
---
Add the 25g + 6,9 gold from 1500 vm...
---
Total saddle cost is 230-240 gold.
---
PLUS! The lamp (30g?) 12x food (35g) and the toys another 6.
---
This is 70 more gold (may be a bit less with buy orders/tp fee if you sell it).
---
Do, 250-300g, leaning towards the expensive side.
---
Oh. What's the difference, some effects on the armor or something?
---
&gt; As the springer, I guess springer can jump faster than skysclale can ascend
---
Is it just me, or did Springer get a stealth buff with a reduced charge time on its jump? I feel like it's faster now compared to PoF's launch.
---
Necros have really good dps and support
---
Just go to metabattle and follow a guide, then you'll get invites :)
---
Gotcha, thanks! That definitely clears things up. Felt like I was taking crazy pills ;)
---
Land on any mildly-horizontal surface and the ceiling is reset.
---
I guess people would just like it more if it actually felt like a part of the game rather than a boring arbitrary checklist. Nothing turns me off more from a game than seeing a huge list of stuff I have to do by following an online guide (or spend hours looking for these small inconsquential hidden interactible objects on my own) for an underwhelming reward. It's not an "achievement", it's just busywork.
---
It's the same idea on how I (and I think many other people) loved early jumping puzzles in which it's obvious how to move forward even without a guide, but hate or quickly get bored with newer ones in which you don't even see where you're jumping/gliding/flying, in which you need a guide to see on which small invisible ledge you can jump without falling. Where you don't even get pretty sights to see or enemies to fight but instead, just look at various rock formations for the entire duration of it.
---
I played Season 1 and I still feel like Dragon's Watch feels forced upon me. The Pact was so incredibly well done - first you become a local hero to your people, then you get recruited by Order representatives of your people, then you realise you need to do things differently, together, to defeat dragons so you become a founding member of the Pact. The Pact kills the first Elder Dragon through a massive effort of collaborative works of different characters and races.
---
All of a sudden, after accomplishing something people believed impossible, you abandon the Pact and join five unaccomplished NPCs to meddle in minor dramas only to basically ignore the Pact once another dragon becomes the main threat.
---
It makes no sense that we basically left the Pact. They should have created an elite team within the Pact, still heavily using the Pact's resources and intelligence but allowing more personal contact with a reccurring cast.
---
The transition from the Pact to Dragon's Watch was probably the biggest narrative mistake they've made with GW2 and the story never recovered from how little that makes sense or how awkward it is constantly dealing with Elder Dragons while trying to create space for our character to be the center of attention. It's a mess they never cleanly broke away from and it constantly holds back the GW2 story in many ways.
---
There are many ledges around the tower I could land on. Combined with Skyscale’s third mastery and Bond of Vigor, you can reach near impossible places. It’s all about pathing your ascent.
---
Ew metabattle.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Hmm... okay, well... maybe I can change attunement with that properly finally.
---
or you can just get it all done by playing pvp.
---
Still waiting for that husky skin
---
dungeon pro here. i dont play dungeons anymore.
---
They didn't kill anyone they considered important anymore in HoT. Eir was a side character to Braham's story, Trahearne was the leader of the mostly irrelevant Pact (they are no longer a multifacted group of explorers, researches, mistics, soldiers, strategists, scientists etc, now they are just a blunt army to form cannon fodder in the background of Dragon's Watch's story).
---
Guild Wars 2 is Game of Thrones Season 8.
---
You can play the story or metas
---
Ive already got the title but Ill help out if you need/still have an open spot.  How do i reach you in game?
---
I dunno why this made me giggle
---
Having to? Last time I checked you got those for free by just doing the metaevents on that map. Or what keyplates are you talking about?
---
Yeah, mostly some crystals and glowing things on the upgraded one, more detailed too.
---
You will need one level 80 character to unlock the mounts. Once they are unlocked, any character on your account can use them regardless of level.
---
They are already using Gorrik for it now. Exposition asura is a writing crutch they can't get away from.
---
Any notable compatibility problems with the new patch to note yet?
---
having irl things to do or not having enough time in general does not count as time gating
---
Not me but since you are looking to get better, videos like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5s5G-tEZQ might be worth something to you.
---
dungeons are alot of fun imo and there is a massive amount of room (for most players) to improve and get faster clear times.
---
hey i got like 3500 dungeon runs im just here to brag
---
I actually feel like this is the best part of the release. After completing the skyscale collection (it was definitely too much work, especially when they should have had you do the collection while using the new mount instead of to unlock it) I think the new armor set was done far better. It wasn't too hard to unlock on the new map, it got me to explore and see all the different things (it also made the achievements worth doing, something GW2 is awful at) and it looks pretty cool.
---
The armor set and the way its acquired or upgraded is easily the best part of this release, dwarfing the mess that is the new mount.
---
Why is the demand of Teal Petals so high? They don't work in the MF, there is no recipe for it and are only good as junk item for sell. Is like a passive increase to gold while you farm, which is pretty good, but the current demand for it doesn't makes sense. People are buying this stuff at more than twice the price you can vendor it, and ... well, you can only vendor it.
---
Is this speculation?
---
In case you don't know the price the petals and blooms go right now:
---
On vendor:
---
1 Teal Petal = 4s
---
12 Teal Petals = 48s
---
1 Teal Bloom = 1g 8s
---
On TP:
---
1 Teal Petal = 9s
---
12 Teal Petals = 1g 8s
---
1 Teal Bloom = 1g 27s
---
Yep, so much dope scenes to remake:
---
- SeeD assault on that city in the beginning
---
- introduction to Galbadia Garden
---
- that whole rebel mission in a train
---
- disc 1 end mission where they try to assassinate Edea
---
- prison escape sequence
---
- Garden concert
---
- Garden battle
---
- Fisherman's Horizon setting and getting to Esthard (sp?)
---
- Lunatic Pandora sequences
---
- time compression sequence
---
- most of the Laguna sequences, especially when they go to the LP
---
- etc
---
...why are they just remaking FF7 again?
---
The music was really, really great this season. I love the roller beetle music, I loved the sinister version of Fear Not This Night, and the mellow Aurene song in Thunderhead really tugs at the heartstrings.
---
My recent favorite is the theme that plays during the Dragonfall Meta, a new iteration of "Pointless Fights" from episode 4! Diving through the sky on the griffon, taking down these evil pylons while the OST plays and an army is slashing away at Kralk below... it is very cinematic and epic, could be something out of a movie!
---
I thought I would use it in this scenario before but...
---
With the very quickly noticed red meter height limitation and slow ascension speed, the Springer is still more useful in a variety of scenarios. There are specific places I would use the Skyscale instead, but definitely not a general replacement.
---
Same here! I bought commander tag around that time, was leading a lane, leading a bubble.
---
We really had to coordinate.
---
Have you experienced any other amazing PvE fights in GW2? I've been looking for the fun PvE content. I haard Raids were really fun
---
I'm making a profit while saving my T6 mats. The Dragonfall meta is ridiculous.
---
I am 200% sure it'll be nerfed, but until then... Ectoplasm for everybody!
---
You just missed a 50% off sale that ended on the 19th.  Another official sale will probably happen in August for the 7-year anniversary.
---
[DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/search?keywords=guild+wars) is often the cheapest official retailer and sells the bundle for $38.
---
Avoid any seller that is not on the [official retailers list](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedKingdom-digital).
---
And why wouldn't you?
---
Nah disagree here, what I said is still what it is and it's not Anet to blame; this community loves to latch on words and repeat them over and over like beating a dead horse lol
---
No. I like collections and epic journeys in games but this was a mess. Three scavenger hunts for the first tier was just ridiculous (scales, then sick skyscales, then eggs - many of which were in the same locations). 
---
The time gates were absolutely awful and it felt like I was waiting to have fun, then they added the cost and while I made a lot of money off of it, I was beginning to have hesitations (my friends all stopped there).
---
There were no rewards along the way (no skyscale backpacks like the springer cub, no miniature skyscales like the BLC minis, no skins for the skyscale or even toys) and they don't really let you use the skyscale (other than on the new map)  so while there is all this new "content" and "gameplay" involved in this release, for all of it you never touch the skyscale anyway. By the time you get the mount, you've been all over Tyria, you've done scavenger hunts, you've farmed the new map a tonne and it feels like one of those games that gives you this crazy ability after you kill the final boss - what's the point, I'm already done playing? I actually hated the final step (find the rifts) because it was so completely redundant (it's supposed to be flight training, but I still need mastery points and experience to train the mount once I have it).
---
The mount itself is actually not that fun. Sticking to walls when you don't want to is a big problem when you just want to land, the canopy is very restrictive and it's not that fast. Overall I find myself not using it much at all.
---
Literally the best thing I can say about it is you can AFK on it safely in the air anywhere in the game. That's likely to attract a lot of people but it's the wrong reason to get a mount.
---
I'm gonna be getting mine today. A lot of people will within the next week.
---
They lower the pitch and add background growls an crackles. 
---
As far as I can remember, they seem to store the original voices and apply the effects on load. Apparently because it's easier to compress voice sounds into smaller file sizes before the effects.
---
yes I did why else would I post this and the friend i was doing it with me got everything . We did the same things and he got the special action key right from the start with the spear.
---
You should see what you make more off of.  Forester Glyphs or VM.  Considering the price of elder wood.
---
Oh so people have actually completed it now? Good
---
How? I mean, you can get in to the first part via mounts through that cave, but once you're up there I'm pretty sure you can't use mounts at all to get to where the Skyscale is. Do you have a video or anything?
---
We all assumed you didn't because your screenshot doesn't tell anything and doesn't even look like you're in Dragonfall tbh.
---
It wasn't a stealth buff, ArenaNet announced that they were going to make the Springer's jump charge up faster to help keep it relevant... well, it wasn't enough of a buff to do that, imo
---
Ban him!
---
Wall latching and bond of vigor don't reset your height limit. The only example of narrow cliff climbing I can think of the skyscale potentially being more useful is when you're fishing for a very specific place to land for a collection/mastery thing as opposed to trying to get over a very large cliff (ex. Augury Rock).
---
Id like the battle for lions arch to be a thing
---
I appreciate the instant cast skills and I love moving the tablet but the orb generation at the beginning of the move instead of the end+lack of remote rez come together to make rezzing one or two people off the stack really feelsbad. When people's poor positioning is the cause of most downs, the lack of remote rez is really apparent especially considering every other decent heal spec has that capability. VG greens, Cairn ports, and Sam kb all have proactive mitigation but people miss them and drag the ren away from the stack.
---
Heal mesmer has the same issues since Illusion of Life can't always lead to a rally.
---
Considering we don't have different quality gathering tools besides limited and unlimited (not counting the level restrictions).  It could be something we might see in the future.  For Exotic (2 slots), and Ascended (3 slots).
---
Obviously I was talking solid gold cost...not inferred value based of using the currency for profit....
---
Bond of vigor does decrease the red bar but not all of it. I literally just tried it
---
Its timegated. The flight paths appear the next day/night cycle after you close the rift.
---
Cryptic?
---
Gratz! I'm still working on all the lws4 currencies myself, I'll get there soon!
---
I only need about 100 more diflourite but that's easy to get.
---
I'll help when you do Caudecus Manor or Arah.  PM'd.
---
Wish more people emphasized this instead of blind praising. Warclaw and skyscale rigs and animations are mostly lazy copypasta.
---
"Moving the goal post" implies it wasn't designed like that from the start.
---
I've had about 75% success with them, I've only encountered one whose final node didn't work. 
---
To trigger them, hover on them. They will glow, draw in energy, explode, and fly away leaving a trail of volatile magic. Each sphere is worth 1 magic, and the final one is worth 5.
---
The real reward is that they all create a path going up into the air, perfect for gaining a tremendous amount of altitude.
---
Don't forget Living World Season 2, 3 and 4 fot the whole Story! (Season 1 is just a recap video today :/)
---
It used to be the tonic rule
---
The same 5hing happen with me once. Jerks, yeah
---
Bc they knew advance what was needed and got past the timegates in advance…
---
Turning the story missions (especially the boss fights) into instances seems like a comparatively effective and smart route of adding repeatable instanced content to the game, and I've always seen it as a logical step. 
---
But then again, I know nothing about developing an MMO.
---
How do you do this Boost? ;o
---
The game will not teach you the things you skipped. Only use the boost if you're prepared to do a lot of dying and wiki research while you learn how to play
---
I'm just level 64. :(
---
Kid friendly?
---
Absolutely loving how they implemented the armor this time, hope this sets a new standard for future fashion items
---
The Warclaw is more or less a copy-paste of the griffon as well.
---
You understand the feel of the class and it helps you find the one you like the most. You'll unlock waypoints youll need if you need to go somewhere. Also...you enjoy the content in the game lol.
---
&gt;Griffon require more gold!
---
Griffon requires 250 gold.
---
According to a recent [complete guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete_skyscale_unlock_guide/) skyscale requires around 41 gold OR 258 gold if you want to skip some stuff by buying it from the trading post.
---
If you have the gold griffon can be done in a weekend without much sweat (if you have a few hours to spare each day) while the skyscale collection has some timegates and seemingly a lot more steps.
---
Well natural lvl brings you a bit into the lore and you also get to experience the low level zones and dungeons as they are intended and don't just rush through everything. For many this is a Downside because they have to do exactly that. They just want to go right to the Endgame. Another point to consider is the gold that you farm on your way to lvl 80. And you will need a lot of gold to the your gear Endgame rdy. If you just boost you sit there with lvl 80 and pretty much zero gold. And then you have to do mindless grinding till you get enough gold. 
---
A con of not using then blast is that you won't get access to the mounts. You first need to go through pretty much  everything in the base game to get high enough to enter the zone's for mounts.
---
I said 99% of PUG healers have access to these rez tools, not that they use them.
---
who are you the discussing-arenanet's-future police?
---
From what I gather (heh) it’s worth it at tree farming locations.
---
that kind of makes sense, unless you're an asura
---
When will the patch that reduces the time gates be implemented?
---
You'll get there fren! You're almost there!
---
Yes, we definitely should ignore because she's simply a toxic person - just like every single social justice whatever/internet-feminists.
---
I'd say teen friendly.
---
The Scarlet world event was....amazing! I'm so sad that it's not a dungeon.
---
Heal Mesmer also lacks… healing. The HPS ceiling is very low, even with mantra.
---
People off stack is definitely heal Ren’s bane. It’s not as bad as they say, since you’re only in Venturi half the time anyway and most of your healing is in Kalla or from staff, but it still sucks. Can be hard to carry a potato group. But then, nothing carries like heal scourge, so…
---
Nobody, just like JP.

You can still scale vertically it just takes effort. Here's jumping from the highest point achievable in BFF  [https://clips.twitch.tv/SucculentFantasticWebGingerPower](https://clips.twitch.tv/SucculentFantasticWebGingerPower)

Takes a while to learn how to use it but you can definitely get to some pretty high up locations when you learn how to fly it and use masteries.

One run with slightly higher DPS means nothing. Do it 10 times with consistently higher DPS you'll have your answer.
---
omg thats great, doing it now xD
---
Please dont kill taimi
---
Yes
---
one thing that i think about is that its not necessary to waste some flight time when u dash, u are using a endurance charge for it.
---
I only ask because it was the first time i kept above 13k but im going to. I may have just gotten lucky with bombs rly
---
Everything.
---
they could make new fractals from this....
---
You don't have to use up your level 80 boost at all. You can keep it to test different classes. The boost send s you to a level 80 area to test out the character. If you don't like how the character plays, you can undo the boost and use it to test another class
---
No, not at all
---
Outside of buying the game itself, pretty much all purchases are convenience and quality of life. You can buy power if you really want in the form of legendary weapons, but they don't have any intrinsic power bonus over ascended weapons. Ascended items are the top tier of gear, and there is a bit of work involved in getting them, but it's really within the scope of a few months max
---
Does... That actually work? I thought raptor would only unlock if it was your active story step, but I haven't ever tested to be sure
---
I can agree. Just once, I'd love to see an asura completely stumped over some alchemagical nonsense, and then an Iron Legionnaire comes in and points out the obvious engineering mistake that the asura never considered possible.
---
The asura are just as overconfident as they are genius, and I wish the writers would stop leaning on the "asura have all the answers" trope long enough for the other races (especially norn or charr) to have some time in the sun.
---
Yeah you do, but I think it's ugly. I'd much rather spend that 200g on all Requiem Armor, for example, which is much more prettier and has dyeable FX
---
I'm pretty sure they lost most of the assets but if possible I think they should just take a season and redo it. I'm sure vets would appreciate going back to the content and I know those of us who missed it would appreciate getting to play LS1. I dont think many would complain about how it breaks the timeline up
---
You know, calling it a spoiler then putting the thing that's questionably spoiling in the title only... defeats the purpose of tagging it at all.
---
I managed to get Gloves in 1 hr by joining a multi-map bridge farm squad. Then I kept opening new instances by entering my guild hall and leaving it. Squad was full, so every time people jumped to a new map I pinged, the game decided it needs to create a new instance. Everybody was super happy.
---
I do love the diversity of mounts in this game, but switching can get annoying, but it is fun to use movement in the different ways, and explore different possibilities
---
Which is also bad writing (in case you're a Charr) because the Inquest was conducting *deadly* experiments on Charr during the previous episode and there were mentions that this race was extremely fragile when exposed to what they were testing (which is implied to be the scarab plague at the end of said episode)
---
[last collection was visiting rifts in various maps with rent-a-skyscale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bomiqm/skyscale_scales_collection_unlock_thread/)
---
I'm in the same boat as you, I stopped playing 3 years ago and just got the PoF expansion and jumped back in. Likewise, I feel like there's a lot of new stuff (or old stuff I forgot about) that's overwhelming me.
---
GW2 is kinda like Skyrim in that you just sort of... explore the area, and things pop up. "Oh theres a vista there, let me find a way to get to it. Theres an event nearby, maybe I should do that." It's kind of jarring to me after spending the last 3 years playing instanced games and arena shooters, both of which are very, very straightforward "get right in the action" type of games. I'm beginning to remember, though, that GW2 is more about exploration and experiencing things organically.
---
What I'm doing right now is going through the story line, since that's a good way to get acquainted with the new maps, but taking the scenic route and stopping for events and whatnot to boost the experience I'm getting towards my mastery tracks.
---
Great post!
---
I must also point out that the main gate of the griffon, the gold, can be acquired however you want. Map currencies? Enjoy your heart and meta grind.
---
This might help explain why it's mice and not mouse in this sentance structure
---
https://www.espressoenglish.net/learn-english-grammar-one-of-all-of-most-of-none-of/
---
Mice is plural to mouse, so it just depends on if you are talking about a singular mouse or a group of mice
---
Biggest point: it's action based game. 
---
Give them some kind of endgame level in god of war, dark souls or something else and what now? You are fully geared/skilled but you won't be able to play on decent level.
---
Also, builds. During levelling you can try everything. All weapons, skills, traits. At max, you know exactly what type of gameplay you like and how to gear up. Boosted equipment locks you out of builds. You will have one, kinda defensive, with one type of dps either condi or power. To try anything else, you have to buy whole set of new, specific 80lv equipment that is beyond reach for boosted players. And trying skills that don't benefit from your boosted stats will make you as powerful as a wet sock full of rotten noodles.
---
But if they are pro players, able to swipe a card to get extra gold for respec at 80, then they are free to go. Also, remember to never tell them stuff they can learn normally. Seeing players picking all loot manually in meta events is rad.
---
We're all Asuras now due to an experiment gone awry in the Eternal Alchemy.
---
Griffon can get that high too albeit taking longer
---
oh damn, I feel dumb now.
---
I know, but unless you have a high starting point it will take a lomg time to build up the a height
---
Sam Reigel is wonderful. I think Matt and maybe Liam also voice a few in GW2?
---
&gt; Literally the best thing I can say about it is you can AFK on it safely in the air anywhere in the game.
---
I can see a certain type of person using this in LA with the most outlandish skin ANet releases, when they already look like someone dipped them in neon tie-dye and glitter. It seems very much like a status symbol mount so that's probably what it's mostly going to be used for as everyone else sticks to the Springer/Griffon combo.
---
Don't, english has so many stupid inconsistencies, even native speakers often screw up. I wouldn't even have picked you up as ESL
---
I LOVE high heels for all three armor types so much!
---
The achievement versions of the armor look a ton better than the vendor crystal versions though.
---
What's the goal? Let them use boost, they can always return to 0-80 on alts. After posting a mandatory "I boosted, what do" thread in here.
---
1-80 = learn the class in question, mechanics of the game, can test every weapon you get before you have pigeonholed yourself, get waypoints you'll want for world bosses.
---
boost to 80 = can instantly play x "endgame content", have to do/get to do all of the above, while possibly be raged at as people expect the basics with you being 80.
---
i suggest checking out the meta builds considering you will only be playing those aspects of the professions for your high end pve.
---
Maybe even try them out in pvp lobby, go trough the rotations on a dps golem (gear doesnt matter for most cases for trying out rotations) and then decide on whats most fun for you
---
I'm running the same build as you and I'm a returning player as well. Thankfully, my muscle memory still serves me well and I was able to recall how to play the build correctly last night. Funnily enough, I also first made a soldiers set before switching to berserkers.
---
Most of your damage is burst rather than sustained. Open with the greatsword 4 (phantasm), then move towards your target and press 2 and then 3. Then dodge towards them for a clone and shatter (mind wrack for damage). This is your opening burst.
---
Once you're done with that switch to sword, since the sword auto is your main source of sustained damage, and the shield offers a lot of utility. You can also set up a burst by using shield 4 and sword 3 for clones, then shattering during your sword 2. By the time your weapon swap cooldown is done, you should be able to swap back to GS and burst again. *Don't* stay in GS and autoattack at range, since that's the easiest way to kill your DPS.
---
Game knowledge.
---
Vindication is supposed to be burstier. On the 10% phase you might have higher damage but loose on the previous 90%
---
Yes but it’s a bit trickier imo. Never managed to really pull it off.
---
Also, you ideally need big open spaces (so finishing the meta basically) whereas with the skyscale there is a hidden route you can use anytime to start climbing.
---
The only way you lose out is if you have a buff that can give you extra gathering swings. It appears to skip those, so you only get extra swings on the one node you touch. This isn't ideal, but it's how extra swings already work: if you do a full base harvest on a node and get an extra swing, and then you go gather something else, your extra swing on that node will disappear. This should probably be "fixed" regardless of the glyph, but it would also benefit the glyph.
---
If you don't use those kinds of buffs, then the glyph gives you the exact same loot as harvesting them all one by one.
---
Contrary to popular comments here, core Tyria teaches you nothing about endgame, gearing, buildcrafting, mechanics, breakbars etc. If you are experienced with mmos you can use boosters and start from there, using wiki when in doubt
---
I'm not a huge fan of the design, but it is probably one of, if not the, best methods to obtaining an armor set. Achievement for a box of the base armor, unlocking skin of one weight and giving recipe for other weights. Then a vendor that sells upgraded skin for a reasonable currency cost. The only thing I'd change about it is that I'd like achievements for completing the sets, kinda like The Best Offence for Requiem, but I don't think they'd need any rewards aside from a few AP. But after spending the past month or so working at Reqium, I was glad to see the new set wasn't as bad to go after.
---
I hated the eggs, but the stack of ls4 currencies? This one is breaking me. Doing hearts multiple times, mining nodes that dont always give you any currencies...this is the one subcollection i wont get done asap because it is so mindlessly boring to me
---
I'd join you if I could because I do daily Arah p1p2p3p4 nearly every day if I can, but sadly I play on EU servers.
---
Especially good at wood farm locations.

I've also made a list of Skyscale related farming guides + I've updated all season 4 routes in my all-in-one pack:-)

If you enter that mini dungeon in Dredgehaunt Cliffs, [the Forsaken Fortune](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forsaken_Fortune), I’m pretty sure the Skelks will run away from you without the need to carry a torch
---
Which soundtrack is from the All or Nothing Trailer?
---
funny thing is i'm almost 30k ap and i dont have all my paths cleared, kinda of a community problem and also my own, cuz the time i was  just a n00b i was playing only necro and ppl used to despite necros on dg's, so i gave up on that content and never looked back :S
---
PM me your account name, I'll add you ingame

Haha cool! Send me your account name in private, I'll add you to friends list ingame and we can chat

Tbh I would do dungeons but I am in EU so I can't sorry
---
1500 VM is worth only 7.5g though.
---
Source: Time of comment https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html says the profit per shipment is 1.21.90 after taxes assuming sell listing (maxing profit).  Each shipment costs 250 VM (so the 1500 currency is only 6 shipments). 
---
12190/250 = 48.76 - so I rounded up to 50c each to be generous.
---
50c * 1500 = 7g 50s
---
So where did you get 130g from?
---
You could also just right-click the precursor and click on unlock skin. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that just makes it account bound.
---
I thought it's an unlimited floating dragon until I saw the green bar :0
---
... why?
---
&gt; And away from my axe.
---
Is this referencing something?
---
I think it is some reasons that they are some copying and pasting on three of those mounts (Griffon, Warclaw, and Skyscale). 
---
They are more like our real-life cats as Large, Medium, and Small Cats. For example, ALL Cats are almost one same behavior. Only depend on their conditions as for an example about the Lions. Lions hate to step in the water pond when the meat in it, but Tiger loves it. Lions struggles to climb up on the tree to get meat, which Leopard love it for their safety and can bring the huge meal top of a tree.
---
Also, the bone body shapes will make the brain will realizing the physical movements to make them look like them.
---
I think it is why Anet uses those methods to set the mounts.
---
More like the wrong neighbour*wood*.
---
How do you even make 50g from fractals? The most I make is usually like 20 something gold, sometimes less..
---
I'd be interested in doing a few runs! Don't know that I can commit to 3 a day but I'd still be down to join for a few.
---
I have done all of the paths at one point or another but for some it's been awhile.
---
ac p123 + cm p123 is like 30mins total
---
yes
---
Now that people are starting to get skyscales, they will complain they don’t fly for too long.
---
lol everyone would be rich if you could get 130g
---
It's a spam bot, just got through our filters because the account is old enough.

Loved the hell out of i9t, immediately made a set for my revenant so i can test out a build for raids.

sure, it's exotic, but does the role rather well i'd say.

I didn't know u could trot what. Teach me ur ways please

Probably referencing how annoying Braham can be and how they wanna chop him up.
---
^(I mean don't we all secretly wanna axe him at some point.)
---
Is that confirmed already :0 ?? Did I miss out something?
---
So many golden children....
---
That would be true if level 1 areas were designed like HoT+ areas, but they really aren't. Even the crap gear you get from boosting to L20 will turn L1 areas into a joke.
---
anet dev spotted :D
---
RIP, that guy's bot farm. If Anet didn't know before, they now know all of his character names.
---
Not confirmed but a lot of her dialogue heavily implies it. Anet isnt known for subtly
---
The heart at Soul's Vendetta Waypoint - [&amp;BIMLAAA=] has huge pieces of rubble laying around. Pick up 3 of them and you can trot, but I'm pretty sure only griffon, warclaw, and skyscale have unique animations for it.
---
THEN IT IS A FEATURE
---
This is me now.
---
She has a broad range of emotions. Sometimes I find her annoying but when she's being serious, I really like her. Especially in Sun's Refuge and when &gt;!she's wailing over Aurene's dead body (that actually isn't dead, and I'm still upset about that :T).!&lt;
---
It's p2w in the sense that you can buy gems with real money and get convenience items and gold which can make you gear faster, BUT all that can be earned reasonably just by earning gold in game at a decent pace. Of course, you will have to pay for the expansions
---
PvPeoneer
---
So a question: People talk about the time-gating. Does this mean my progress resets at any point because of time limits? Or is it just a limit on how quickly I can get the collection done?
---
He probably just makes alts, unfortunately. It's way too easy to bypass a ban now that the game has a F2P alternative, or plenty of ways to get extra keys on sale or for free from giveaways.
---
I wouldn't say that reports don't do anything... I've had many, many friends get caught for multiboxing and they've received varying suspensions from a few days up to permanent ones.
---
12 as far as I'm aware.
---
Doing the full WvW or sPvP track gives 3 weapons and 1 armor piece, as well as some dungeon tokens. The reward tracks are repeatable so you can do them over and over until you have all the pieces
---
Does anyone know the best meta to just get VM as efficiently as possible?
---
What?! Straight up 3 weapons and 1 armor from a DUNGEON COLLECTION??
---
If that's the case... I am totally sold :(
---
PvP and WvW have reward tracks that gain progress and give you loot as you participate in those game modes. You can choose a reward track for a specific dungeon and get rewards from that dungeon.
---
Ahh, yeah I do know about the theories from her dialogue. If it's gonna happen it'll happen in season 5 probably.
---
Found out yesterday those choppers instant kill anybody they actually hit directly... Now I know what to blame!
---
Feels bad man. I'm learning German in my spare time since I want to love in Germany eventually but reading this made me realise how much more I need to learn lol.
---
Since that is in VB it is definitely not a F2P account. Also need 25 laurels and 15g for that back. The gold probably doesn't matter if they are botting but the laurels require a bit of waiting.
---
They look like tomatoes
---
How does it work on Windows?
---
Is it bad that I didn't even realise before I read the caption?
---
Works great i will put up a guide here in a min
---
There's also nothing else to do
---
Fair on the F2P front, but still... If you run a bot that can keep you online 24/7 farming on however many accounts, that backpack is nothing but a couple weeks of play. He could have played for a month 3 years ago, gotten the backpack for all his bots, been banned for 2 years, and now be back - having a certain item doesn't prove anything in regards to whether he's been banned before, or whether he's legitimately paid for those accounts.
---
We get content?
---
I farm home instances every day and even though I'm only getting a bit at a time, it adds up and I have all those currencies. With how valuable home instances are I'm surprised more people to farm full ones daily. Particularly because it often gives you one of your dailies anyway and there are always people offering. It means a lot less farming when you need them.
---
GW2 was my first MMORPG and I accidentally bought PoF before even HoT so I was even more confused than missing just season 1
---
Pls do, I was bummed out when I saw on that dev stream how basically everything but flying was the same.   
---
Also I really hate his face, looks dumb af. I like the idea of him curling his neck and tail like a snake, but then you see that absolute unit stance with his legs. He is like a bulldog-snake with stolen animations.
---
I'm almost there, hopefully i can completed this in 2 more days.
---
I miss dungeons =\
---
after Tiiiiiiiime
---
Not so much after this episode tbf 🤔
---
Taimi was really helpful in ls3
---
Just farm Istan or Riba then, back in the day when Griffon was released Istan was still fully functional, a good group could hop maps and clear Palawadan up to 2-3 times per event and get Great Hall done in the downtime.
---
Its harder nowadays but I started with PoF release and it was really easy to make gold then, just dont waste your time doing whatever! Farm gold the fast way and not the slow one.
---
Servers only matter for WvWvW.
---
As long as both of you are on either NA servers or EU servers, you can play together.
---
But if you want to play WvWvW with your friend you both have to be on the same server.
---
Only if you want to play WvW together will you have to change servers. Everything else is on a mega server
---
It's Mermay in the art community, everyone's drawing mermaids. Nice Trahearne fanart though.
