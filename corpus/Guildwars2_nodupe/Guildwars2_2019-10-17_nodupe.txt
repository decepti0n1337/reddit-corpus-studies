Bit late on the repost there buddy

---
Oh Steve, I've missed you like...
---
Lol, maybe you should migrate to hello kitty island adventure, more your speed for its wholesomeness, wouldn't want words like cuck or mcfaggin to disrupt your delicate sensibility
---
same thing! jumped down, glided, landed, STEVE WAS RIGHT BEHIND THE CORNER
---
OOooooo nice.  As a huge Destiny fan, looking forward to seeing how the story develops.  The recent expansion is turning out pretty good right now.
---
Sounds like you should do some tests
---
Part of the oath process was supposed to call upon deep and powerful emotions as part of the binding... Fighting to the death for a greater cause, our character's social anxieties about the people we're surrounded by, being basically tortured with fire, water and having rocks thrown at us etc... Stuff that could be candidate for being revealed in the Dream.  
---

---
BUT  
---
The whole thing was hammed up so hard the whole way through that I would not be shocked in the least if they put it out in story that the whole thing was bogus to begin with.  It felt more like a fraternity/sorority hazing-type initiation than something deadly serious.
---
Are you drunk?
---
I had the same disappointment
---
Armor skins that can't even be dyed are so pointless
---
Well, you *did* say "how to make gold" in your title...
---
Yea
---
&gt; ...assumption based on a lack of information.
---
The hilarious thing being that letting people make assumptions on lack of info is almost certainly SOP for a secretive agency like the Blade.
---
&gt;monetization, as i stated, they couln't monetize much from wvw compared to pve
---
* You know, I think this is false. I can't count the amount of wvers who were sporting new gliders quickly after anet introduced gliding to wvw.
---
* Mounts? I sure see a lot of people with mount skins.
---
* Fashion? The number of legendary weapons I see in wvw is nuts too. And lets talk about the number of legendary backpacks made there too.
---
* Server transfers? Yeah, gems.
---
* There's tons of things they could add that I'm sure people would love. Any amount of cosmetic stuff based on rank and kills.
---
They can totally apply their fashion formulas to WvW and make money. What's hurting right now is the core issues that haven't been addressed.
---
Maybe the problem is that they've taken to calling their GMs devs for so long they're confused about the number of developers actually working on WvW.
---
For a game mode in which the fundamental content has changed so little and yet remains popular, it's insane they haven't tried to make it more successful.
---
Look in LFG for meta trains. Usually they’re between 6:30 pst - 9:30 pst if you have time. You can hop in and out any time. Guarantees you to get the metas done.
---
Imagine losing to a 'god' who you can auto attack 111 to death.
---
Nah im afraid id run into you if i started playing that game

---
I landed in an empty lab and he spawned right on top of me so I tried to solo him. it didn't go well....
---
&gt; That would mean that the oath is bound to your spirit.
---
Which would make since, given Livia is a necromancer.
---
Seriously. If I want the shadow raven mini-pet (which I do) that's approx ~40k bags to get the 120 candy corn cobs, ignoring that I also want a bunch of halloween pails. Guess I might get it next year lol unless the cobs drop a ton in price
---
This is one of the things Anet won't answer since they don't know if they will use it in future or not.
---
Same thing with Lyssa (Balthazar cursed all gods except her), , what happened with Balthazar's former power (did someone took it and became new god; was it sealed somewhere or maybe it was split  between remaining gods), etc. They put some things there and there and leave it to potentially use it in future.
---
*laughs in Skyscale*
---
Yeah I love how my Charr is now a lackey of the Human Queen.
---
Gonna suck if the 2 nations ever start fighting again.
---
"I'm just gonna sit this one out."
---
We don't know, and I imagine it's a plot thread that's going to be dropped.
---
It was a *really* bad idea to force our characters to swear allegiance to the queen's lackeys.
---
There are some players who park alts at each checkpoint.  I use LFG to find them, and tip generously if they don't have prices.
---
GOOD.
---
I would have been super salty had they just resorted to using Crystal Desert mastery points. I got enough purple, thanks.
---
Bud, I think you may be a bit colorblind. It's very very purple.
---
Free accounts are accounts you haven't paid for at all. If you bought the game before it went free to play, whether you have expansions or not, you're an upgraded account.  Buy any expansion or the original core game, you're an upgraded account.
---
But an upgraded account can be a core game that doesn't have restrictions, but it can also be a game with expansions. When you buy Path of Fire now you get Heart of Thorns as well, which would give you both expansions and the core game without restrictions.
---
This means two sets of elite specs, access to an additional 9 zones, ability to use guild hall buffs, masteries including mounts and gliding  and log in rewards, if you weren't a paid account before.
---
lmao, when you're doing the most damage on a minstrel healer you know something is wrong.
---
You can't do Chalice of Tears, but you can do the tops of the Draconis Mons and Siren's Landing JPs, for some map currency and a nice free little blob of Unbound Magic to go with your loot (DM usually includes a crest, and SL sometimes has a freshwater pearl).
---
At least your runes have power in  them for "dps" I assume.
---
It's actually the same, both warrior and guardian are heavy so the [Devona set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s_armor) will be the best for you. Check out the [gearing guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for other options and ways to get weapons and trinkets. I would really suggest you not go tanky, GW2 is very focused on avoiding damage with the use of dodges, blocks, and invulns. You should be trying to learn and get better at timing your skills and blocks. Dragonhunter F3 is a very powerful block and gives free aegis when not in use, focus 5 is 3 blocks. Your heal skill is also very powerful and basically makes you invulnerable while it is active (assuming you're dealing good damage). What PvE content are you having issues with? I may be able to offer some more specific advice. Also the sigils of accuracy suggested in the build you linked are useless as you hit 95% crit even with no runes, sigils, food, discipline, or spotter. I'd suggest just building towards the [raid](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/)/ [fractal](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter) build for now and leaving the runes as the default Devona ones (strength) while you save up for scholar eventually (I'd only swap when you get all 6). You can also work on getting sigils going but you're ok starting without them. 
---
Let me know if you want any help as well!
---
The oath was supposed to call upon those strong emotions, in other words it counts and it's now part of the dream.
---
Oops.
---
I won one of the races but I think it's only because I was able to get away from the Labyrinth horror before he yeeted everyone else off their mounts.

Chattering laugh in chattering skulls.

I miss that... I really do. If it was a nice long range wave, it was a beautiful thing.

XD

&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, I am 45, and my motor control is also not the best since chemo, so there might be something to that, too. I mean, I'm good at twitch modes (WvW, PvP and raiding in other games) but this is somehow different.
---
I mean just by being a Sylvari you do that by existing.
---
Nah even as someone who played GW1 it was trash, and they did Livia and Lazarus dirty.
---
Oh most definitely, they wrote themselves into a stupid corner with a stupid plot line that should never be brought up again.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Luminous_Heavy_Pauldrons_Skin I believe

They're part of the armor sets you can get for your 6th or 7th birthday

Wow that sucks, thanks for saving me the effort.
---
Is there a way to raise gamma (brightness) of Guild Wars 2 client in macOS WINDOWED mode?
---
Was running a comm tag up.... had lich fight going on and ppl kited Steve over to us.... ugghhhhh
---
As a legally blind player, I have begged ANet for *years* to allow us to have the minimap and chat on the same side, so I can actually navigate and see text commands/chat/whatever. Nope, they really do not give a shit about disabled players!   
---
It's the one thing that's almost made me quit the game, and makes me consider it every time I discuss it  because of their indifference to disabled players and this would not be a difficult thing to do.  GW1 allowed you to do exactly this, so they went BACKWARDS in accessibility.
---
&gt; Back in Divinity's Reach in the secret Shining Blade Headquarters under one of the mausoleums, Anise agreed to have the Commander take the Shining Blade oath so that Exemplar Kerida (Livia) could reveal her intentions with the aspects. One of the exemplars protested the Commander taking the oath, but was silenced after Anise said that she had been watching the Commander for a very long time.
---
 -[living world season 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3)
---
I don't think it was making the commander *part* of the shining blade. even then, what would the commander do with that information that livia is alive anyways? tell a few people? like people *know* the shining blade exists as a the queen's royal guard. the only way for the commander to find out that Kerida is Livia is by taking the shining blade oath as her whereabouts is a shining blade secret. if the commander did tell people that Kerida is Livia, Livia can so easily just make up a new identity, as well as have Anise even help her through that process with mesmer magic. 
---
but let's say it *does* hold up, what's the thing that would actually kill the commander at this point? *the shining blade?* Anise would *know* how important, hell, how much it weighed for the commander to be alive; their death would just bring them back as the world is not done with the commander, there's a much greater importance in the commander than there is with telling one secret anyways.
---
In game gamma is only in full screen mode, you'd have to use something else to change the computer wide brightness.
---
That's 120 gold. Not nothing.
---
Not really, there is a mystic forge recipe to get obsidian shards but it's not worth it.
---
and getting pubstomped by the god of war is barely "legendary"
---
thats because you are not reading, maybe that also is why you look at every wvwer talking about the poor state of the game and all you read is "complain this, complain that" maybe if you start to read you would understand better
---
first you have to read it as a whole, connecting all the dots, you want a brief explanation? current fb+scourge+rev meta, turned this game into a wow clone, were the side with more players, spamming more skills win, ok? second, mounts turned this game mode into a "get back in line" style, were everyone is running towards a zerg, that means no more havoc groups, roaming groups, zerg busting groups, solo players, ninja capturers, etc... do you get it now? i never said mounts affected combat, mounts affected the gamestyle, this pirate ship meta ruined the rest
---
" No, that's what the game was like before mounts and aside from the bit  about firebrands and scourges, higher populations servers have always  beaten lower population servers. "
---
Now this made me belive you are not a wvw player, or at least not a long term player who has seen all the eras, because its amusing you tell me higher pop servers always beaten lower pop, yet you don't even aknowledge all the types of groups that were running around back then, any wvw player who has been around for longer than 2 years knows back in the day low or high population didn't matter at all, because organized groups could beat zergs in a 10v30 match anyday anytime, they were called havoc/zerg busting groups and they were all around, or maybe siege before it was completely nerfed to the ground, with 2 arrow carts you could hold off a giant blob for hours, guess which change ruined it for havoc groups... you got it? it has something to do with everyone running around with 10k hp extra and 3 dodges.... now you understand? how between the stupid meta we have now and those beloved stupid cats the whole experienced took a serious downgrade towards android mmo combat?
---
Game's still in beta.
---
Doing the race is easier and faster than 30 cobs
---
S3E6 was so bad I stopped after I got to Orr. Wrapping up the Mursaat may have been one of the biggest mistakes they made in the story other than "Kralk wasn't *that* bad"
---
As you already acknowledge, you can't use GW2 Effeciency for that, since the data is slated toward more involved players. Actual casuals don't even know GW2 Effeciency exist, let alone have an account.
---
Sounds like you're being a total ass hat. But who am I to judge?
---
lol, probably.
---
I'm blind, not colorblind.
---
That's like saying that the Poke Balls in the games are red when in fact they're fucking ORANGE. It drives me insane!
---
...I'm talking about the item icon in the bag, not the actual ball that is thrown in 3D or the ball sprite used for battle scenes in the 2D games.
---
I know my way around colors. I could be off on the name or the fucking hex code but I know purple from red. It's almost like there are varying degrees of tones out there, gasp!
---
What's even more funny, when you go fight in WvW this could actually give you an edge over an enemy. They'll have a problem mousing over your food to check the build you are probably using.
---
Ah yes, the obvious choice. lol
---
Not sure if I'm not playing the right build or unlucky but most of the time I find that mobs die way to fast for anyone to tag unless you are like the first 3 ppl in the front. So what's the point of being in a 30 man squad? Just curious.
---
Yes
---
Thankyou for your G
---
It all depends on how fast your build is and how quickly it takes to deliver each packet of damage. Take say a staff necro for example, everything is on a 3/4 sec cast time per mark which will likely tag ~3 mobs at 1200 range with additional time to target select. Compare that to a shortbow thief which can tag 3 mobs in 1/4 sec autoattacking at 900 range and it will let you tag more mobs overall. Another route is just to try to move ahead by being faster, say by adding movement abilities. It's worth playing around and just finding what you are comfortable with.
---
Other than that, reminding your group to lower the dps or stick to the deathball can work too, sometimes people just forget to do that or don't know.
---
I hate that weird on the racing scarves, I'd love to use them but they look like plastic.
---
Pvp mistforged armor and Pvp obsidian sword
---
Opened 115k last year, no ember infusion. Not this year satan.
---
much faster, especially if you wait until the last day of the festival
---
Aw you got me
---
SUPER IMPORTANT: USE ALL OF THE MAGIC FIND BOOSTERS YOU CAN
---
It's light and day farming with and without them. with 700+ MF you can get over 800 bags/h. If you also have crystallized essence, this is the time to use them for an extra 12g/h
---
The majority of the community is very friendly, there just exists that toxic portion in every game. Probably because they think because decent at video games means anything in life. Hardcore gamers are basically a waste of time.
---
You could even say that it has been discussed endlessly since the build templates post first appeared, both here and on the official forums.
---
Don’t feel I can contribute thought, because every thought has already been talked about on this idea a thousand times in various posts both here and in the official forums.
---
lol, ok 
---
 " You can still beat a poorly coordinated, unaware pug group full of noobs with an organized group. " 
---
This shows me you didn't even read half of what i wrote, and you know shit about havoc groups, portal bombs or melee train/ball and all the crazy combos you could make
---
"  The meta you are describing of everyone getting in a group and throwing out abilities has always been meta and always will be "
---
As i said above this also shows me you know shit about really cordinated high skilled havoc guilds or zerg busting raids, did you start playing wvw after pof?
---
 " capture the camp, then run away as soon as any enemies show up " 
---
and this sums it up, as i said you clearly lack wvw hours, and a lot of reading, won't waste my time explaining how good this game was, you clearly won't understand, how long have you been playing wvw btw?
---
Next time can be better ask to the owner instead take a screenshot :)
---
My friend sent this to me asking what the shoulder was and I didn’t know. I didn’t take the photo
---
ah ok ok, I just suggested it.
---
Power Warrior is a solid damage dealer. Metabattle.com is also a great resource. If you want to get into the JUICY content and classes, you can buy Path of Fire and it comes with Heart of Thorns as well
---
Wow, I got a Red Infusion on the first day, worth about 107 gold.  I must have gotten REALLY lucky, as it does not appear once on that table.  Probably my biggest RNG roll in 16 years of Guild Wars.
---
Just adding: While pulling mobs together is good, using the Raptor engage is discouraged. It pulls them together, but brings regular mobs to half  HP in the process.
---
Thanks so much for the efforts!
---
this community is exactly same as any other,but you cant rly fuck ppl over in gw2,so ppl think that ppl are nice here. you shoud visit some META events,pvp and you gona find out,that ppl are just toxic everywhere.
---
So that's where she was during  Endgame.
---
Made 80-90 with one char yesterday. That's pretty neat, didn't expect that much with this way!
---
Yeah Tekkits Routes are awesome! It's pretty quick with all these methods, didn't expect that. It's great to replay the old maps and I don't think with this pace it's too much of a grind / trouble. Thanks for your answer!
---
TBH 200-400 euros is very reasonable for something of that quality. Considering it's realistic, the lighting and perspective. 🤷
---
Never forget, what one person finds difficult is not necessarily what another person finds difficult, and **neither** of them is wrong.
---
Like i get it in situations when the WP is far away (sometimes I will also stay dead and wait for the fight to be over so someone can revive me)
---
But in the labyrinth, when on WP, you hop on griffon and can be anywhere in 2 seconds.
---
This man litteraly chased me all across the map
---
It's easy to repeat once you've mastered it but it takes time to get there, don't feel bad.
---
Mine is in the historical section which means it would be impossible to progress ...
---
Tell your friend that all armour skins can be viewed in the wardrobe option of your bank. Locked an unlocked. 
---
Then all you need to do is type /wiki and then a space and shift click the item when you have foiund it to bring up ther wiki page to tell you how to get it.
---
That is NOT a screenshot
---
Are there ways to get these boosters as a new player without a level 80 main?
---
Yup, it's not late notes, it's a new patch.
---
If anyone is wondering they are 60s a stack gold baron btw
---
just finished, thanks heaps :D
---
Yes because people can play both. I play classic but I also play GW2 its not a case of choosing one over the other.
---
I doubt most people know how flexboxes behave - I work in IT as a web dev and at least 95% of my company don't get how it works :')
---
But it's flexible
---
That's why I want this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcn35w/gear_blueprints/
---
Works even with screaming at the wind. Just quadruples all effort. So...yeah.
---
On a sidenote: I wonder what offended people *so badly*.
---
I've been playing since Factions
---
The Commander stresses that in various forms (depending on race) right before taking the oath that we can't be anyone's lackey or at the Queen's call. Countess Anise said that we would be an agent at large, and that we are free to do as we like as long as its not against the interests of Kryta.
---
needs more boons
---
Looks same to us Europeans
---
I still see it :S
---
I meant left the way they are by the devs, as in they haven’t been updated or really worked on. Sorry if that wasn’t clear.
---
He's building an army, hide yo capital cities p\_p
---
But are they a light source, like the Haunted set for example?
---
honestly, i doubt any1 at Anet even remembers this. and im 99.9% sure it will never come up again
---
Who exactly buys those?
---
As fast as you want, baby.
---
Preferably slow enough that they don't liquidate in mid-air, I think we could get more than one use out of each li'l quaggle before it pops.
---
that's some weird ass shoulders you got there
---
Now can we have permanent ghost/regular ones too? I love both but hate the changing
---
Its gone
---
I tried classic then went right back to GW2. Besides I don't have to pay a sub to play GW2.
---
There hasn't been any noticeable change in players IMHO
---
Festival achievments
---
Even for games with sub fee, QoL and most cosmetics are paid or non existent.
---
Theres three different tabs (plus dailies) for halloween achievements, think you maybe just missed a tab
---
If your comm is killing rather than tagging, and isn't waiting for the full group to arrive at mobs doors, find a new comm. Doors scale, so not having the full crew there when you knock costs everyone bags, including the comm.
---
&gt; Disable Player Item Chatter
---
&gt; * Disable the random chatter from player items, such as the Replica Job-o-Tron Backpack.
---
Maybe it could, you don't know.
---
&gt; head onto the LFG system under "Core Tyria - Squads"
---
Please, don't do this. There is Festival category for squads.
---
This is new, you had to have finished LS4 - EP3. =)
---
something you can always get is food. specifically omnomberry bars or creams and halloween utility such as flask of pumpkin oil. if you're in a guild you can get the guild magic find booster as well. also there will most likely be a hero and spirit banner you can pick up either in the lab or in lions arch at the entrance. you could also buy a booster for laurels at any laurel merchant.
---
i think no gaming company will say anything about that because money... apple even removed taiwanese flag from their iOS to not anger china
---
It is at least 50/50 already and you should encourage in such guides to make people switch to proper category :)
---
Anet stays out of it the same way 99% of companies do.
---
So can I go and play a long range power dps rifle necromancer? A spear warrior on land? Maybe a support thief with a warhorn?   
---
By the way, why do people who don't even understand what a meta is have such a fixation on sucking dicks?
---
Most notable boosters are: 
---
Hero/Gold and Magic Find banners
---
Spirit Banners
---
Most Halloween foods/utilites (the MF boost with boons is best if you can sustain them)
---
Item boosters, celebration boosters, and MF boosters you will get over time, not usually worth the gems. 
---
Guild Magic find drink thing from the tavern
---
Black lion booster (not sure if this is worth the statute, but it's an option).
---
Communal bonfire boosts (the hardest to get, but take it if someone drops one)
---
Check the wiki if min maxing is a priority
---
No why should they. What to capitalise on Blizzards mistakes. Yeah Anet use Hong Kong to get more players. Gaming companies should stay out of politics.
---
I feel the same
---
&gt;went up suddenly
---
It simple, dev asked people's feedback about CM fractals, which means they working on them. That also may lead to new recipes, sinks for materials, etc. Speculation, yes, but its cheap for ~~us~~ to do.
---
Maybe I am confusing year 1 and 2 then. Year one I would have done it on my ranger, year two would have been on my ele or warrior. I remember moving faster than some of my friends, going into the pvp lobby messing with my pvp locker and seeing that the build had run speed increase in it somewhere, then my friend and I experimented with what run speed enhancers worked. Thinking more about that, it was probably year two, I remember testing to see that the warrior melee weapon run speed increase didn't work because you didn't count as having a weapon equiped.
---
Then where does it start? Because I talked to the candy man in the LA fort and it didn't change anything.
---
The commander has never met Desmina. Anet has come out and explicitly said that the Commander, and the Raiding group are completely separate from each other in the lore.
---
It’s purple lmao.
---
Emm, but our character literally mention events of personal story in wing 4.. Tsk, thats what happens when you keep getting new narrative designers.
---
The Jackal can use its movement ability on upward slopes which the Raptor and Skimmer fail miserably at. It can also use it in mid-air to instantly change direction and completely negate fall damage. Without abilities it is the fastest mount on land too. The evasion perk is *really* good as well though the Griffon is even better at abusing that one (seriously I do not understand why it gets *sooo many* evasion frames with every damn flap!)
---
Also the enchanted sand just looks *way* cooler than a stinking lizard or dumb kangaroo-bunny but maybe that's just me.
---
Depends on your group.
---
A good commander call for retreat, pull Steve away, kill Steve, then get back to Viscount and explain how to do the candy corn vomit mechanic / when to drop your reflects.
---
When going uphill, maneuvering inside caves and traversing uneven terrain is faster/easier with jackal than with raptor.
---
It also allows you to negate falling damage when dropping from very high places - just teleport before hitting the ground and you can keep going.
---
Jackal is &lt;3
---
dumb idea
---
Since I use griffon the most I don't really need to negate fall damage.
---
And even if it's the fastest without skills, but why don't use the skills?
---
But Thanks for the repsonse :)
---
Even if this is the case when they join the squad message will be there instantly. And even if they don't see that then people usually tell them to read it when group realise the person is not working together with the squad. 
---
And still after all the chances to grasp what the squad wants, some people being shitty back and moaning about why things are in a certain way and why not change the group to be like that person want even though there are like 50 other lab open who will give that player exactly what he need.
---
I don't get why they made an icon saying that your food has run out that looks exactly the same as the food big icon.
---
Just take away the icon like it was for years. Now when I think I still have food, I actually don't.
---
I use jackal 95% of time, not sure is if used raptor since i got jackal, sometimes i just jump with this ugly-ass rabbit. Jackal is perfectly fine, there is nothing to upgrade.
---
I definitely prefer them stacking horizontally than vertically.
---
That Sherry person seems to have some real connection issues o\_o
---
Also: impressive work man, thanks for sharing :&gt;
---
Oh yeah you meant these things, okay. Welp, they were last in gem store from 4 June to 2 July, sooo prolly not soon, but maybe soon, never know with these gem store stuffs.
---
You mean THAT herald.. I want to kill her so bad, she is too anoying...
---
Why would they? Don't get the point...
---
no, its a mastery. you approach a rift and follow trails of dots. wtf
---
It's a company, they side with money. The best stance is no comments on political stuff, which is what pretty much all companies do. Including Blizzard, by the way. The didn't "sided with China", they have a policy to prohibit people participating in their events to use them as a stage for political agendas. Which is why the same would've happened if someone made a pro China statement.  
---
The punishment was clearly too harsh, though.
---
Haven't played since HoT.  Opened my inventory and it's just full of stuff. I can't remember the significance of these things. Are there any apps or sites that can help me to understand what to junk and what to keep?
---
(I don't have the new expac.)
---
Vistas in Grothmarr count for Ascalon dailies.
---
If you in-game, type /wiki  
---
It should redirect you to the wiki, and there's plenty of info where you can check if is trash or not.
---
What are the recommended weapons for each profession ?
---
Interesting, but also fun fact mining and visas in labyrinthine cliffs count for maguma jungle dailies
---
For game mechanics, it's Ascalon. 
---
For lore purposes, I think it's unclear, since it's the Ascalon that the charr first conquered from the Forgotten but not the Ascalon was was conquered by humans.
---
Hey, Magister Tassi... Got something for me?
---
Yeah, I didn't mean to paint you as definitely being afraid of getting hacked or whatever else, there are as you said lots of reasons to be leery of third party programs that have nothing to do with malicious intent. I thought in my first post I was more general in listing them but I lost that as it went on. "At your own risk" is just too much of a risk for some people (and I didn't even consider use cases like disability software) and that's totally fine.
---
Not really, PvP received plenty of attention for the first few years they added maps, features like spectator mode, tried several systems like paid/free tournies, the original leaderboards, solo/team queues, etc.
---
And perhaps most importantly basically designed and balanced the game as far as combat goes virtually entirely around PvP until a little before HoT when they also started to consider PvE raids.
---
Yet most of the PvP playerbase quit within 18 months, the most known team at that team (Team Paradigm) quit before HoT, etc.
---
So neglect had little to do with it in PvP's case.
---
Now WvW was neglected and that did account for loses, but even then a lot of the big guilds / alliances quit early on, simply because WvW as an RvR game was poorly designed. (e.g 4, very openly designed, maps is PvDoor heaven, no mechanic to encourage the 2nd and 3rd teams to attack the 1st, transfers/bandwagon, etc)

*you leave hell-o kitty out of this*
---
A lot of people still playing since gw1. It was the first halloween event in Tyria when I reached Lions Arch.
---
Do you not mean Skyscale Flight, the last part of the Skyscale Collection? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_Flight
---
Do they need to?
---
no and they dont have to.
---
What a great time early GW1 was, I remember having to go into the instance outside of town and drop trading your gems with people because there was no trading system or TP
---
Doesn't matter how you coat it up, the fact they made us join an human faction is bulshit and one of the worst moves this game has done in terms of story. It was also when I stopped taking story seriously and giving it so much attention.
---
It has been getting better thankfully but its a move it still stings whenever I boot my norn up (which is my main character for story).
---
well actually I know people that were not able to beat balthazar solo and asked for help, after having a 30 minutes fight against him
---
The conditions the opposite way around though. Dying is the effect,  spilling the secrets is the cause. No one said the oath doesn't remain when dead.
---
I opened some (personalized) bags and they didn't count for achi. Regular bags should be fine.
---
I think they did a great job but hope this is not going to be how they handle new stuff from now on.
---
Even after all these years of playing (since release) I am still contemplating if it is worth buying the commander tag. Until now I still couldn't find a reason to get it, because you can do pretty much all of the content the same way without dropping 300g for the tag.
---
 And it's not like I can't afford it. But the frugal economic in me just can't let me do it as I can't see the ROI on this.  I know most of the game metas, but I'm not really an expert at meta driven pve. Even after all these years I still feel a bit "green" at some of them. So why even tag up? But at times like the lab farming, I sometimes feel like I would rather lead myself and start on fresh maps, than  trying to get into a full one. But that's still like 10 hours of farming just for the tag, do I really want to do that?
---
So fellow commanders, what convinced you and how do you think you've made it worth yourself with using the tag? Did you ever regret it, how did this change the game for you? And would you encourage me to do it?

Verrry slooooowly.

you know in gw1 buffs and debuffs were displayed in 2 different locations and were easy to read.
---
Would be nice if they could move maybe say food and flag/semi perm buffs to under your health bar or someplace less dynamic than where every boon and condition go as well &gt;&lt;
---
also maybe boon on the left condi's on the right and they fill from thier respective side and have thier own space, yea that would be nice

I will take the one thing at a time advice! And I think that's what drew me to Rev honestly, the skill set feels so fluid when you actually do pull a combo off. At first I hated playing it and the set utility skills but it grew on me and became my favorite profession before long. Thanks for the help and encouragement, sounds like you've got Rev down pretty well and I'm excited to get there too.
---
Gw2 isnt casual, its aggressive towards anyone who doesn't conform to the low-performance playstyle.
---
Casual in any other game means something else than it does here, even if there is some overlap.
---
&gt; I'm not a he, Lady is right in the name. C'mon now.
---
That never stopped anybody. ;)
---
Wow has several magnitudes more casual players than gw2. Percentage wise their demographic might be different, but wow still has vastly more players than gw2. Including casual ones.
---
You forgot: Commanders not being doors
---
CSS can insert text with the content property when selecting :after and :before tags.
---
You could use that to make your CSS file add "Internet Explorer is bad and you should feel bad" all over the page.
---
Something like this:
---
    
---
    *:hover::after {
---
    content: "IE is bad and you should feel bad";
---
    }
---
@support queries do not work in IE, so you can't use that to make the rule only work in IE only, but you can make the rule universal, then use @support to override it.
---
Minion doors are always worth it, and the more players there are the more minions you get to farm as it scales up.
---
The doors that spawn Veterans aren't really worth it loot wise, but they still give XP and Karma.
---
Champion doors are skips. Unfortunately you can't skip Steve and he will just keep up with the zerg, so you generally have to deal with him.
---
There's an easy way to get the scarf with an exploit I discovered yesterday night (I sent the bug report so do so at your own risk)
---
Start the race, when it's almost finished go back to the trial npc and tell him you're going for speed, then go finish the race. For some reason the game considers this as gold time and you get the scarf. My record is 1:28s which is way above the gold time limit, and I have the scarf.
---
That barrier tho.
---
I've been playing Guild Wars on and off since the Guild Wars 1 beta.
---
No, I use it all the time. If you're not getting full use out of raptor's jump, jackal is faster. There are plenty of small hills that sabotage raptor's ability to go fast. There's also the evasion, super useful when going through groups of mobs.
---
Never saw this before. Great tip!

no, i mean Rift Repair, part of the skyscale mastery track

Type /wiki, shift click an item, then hit enter.

Daww, how precious

FOR SCIENCE!
---
The effect is kind of buggy. If you change maps at all you will still have the food buff but not the ghost effect. I made sure to eat the food at each location prior to event spawning or opening chests.

Not gonna happen.

Tons of games feature politics in many ways. In some cases even real world politics.
---
It'll be like trying to get politics out of literature. Yeah, you can have books without politics, but you can't have politics out of literature.
---
As a high school biology teacher, I quite literally read them on a daily basis. Yes, there is one particular natural cycle, which we commonly refer to as the circle of life, which includes death and birth. But natural cycles are everywhere, and life and death are not necessarily part of all of them. There's the seasonal cycle, the tidal cycle, the day and night cycle, to name a few examples. None of those have death as a necessary part of them.
---
Now to get back to Anet as a studio; of course there will likely be a point where the studio stops existing. It's not a rule that is as absolute as death is for humans, since companies can survive way longer than a human life, but it's likely to happen at some point.
---
I was simply stating that a few well known people leaving isn't necessarily a sign that the company as a whole will soon be breathing its last. It is common for big companies, and especially big companies in the gaming industry, to have a high turnover of employees. Therefore it's more likely that these people leaving is just part of that 'natural turnover' than anything else.
---
I'm doing the pvp reward track anyway which will reward you with a pail at the end. 
---
I just thought, I could open the bags I get while doing the reward track to buy me an extra Paul, but after I saw this post, I noticed what a waste that would be.
---
And today you learned that only a percentage of the GW2 player base is informed, and of that percentage, only a smaller percentage reads REDDIT, and of that smaller percentage, only a smaller percentage agrees with this advice...and so you end up with a considerable amount of folks who want to open bags, even if it means buying them from the TP.
---
Was gonna say, it kinda clashes with your look =(
---
We're never gonna go after Bubbles because nobody gives a damn about underwater
---
It was worth it for me from a quality of life standpoint. Being able to easily put together raids, get help on open world events, and heck even just using squads instead of parties with friends so I can mark their heads with an icon when we're part of big groups.
---
I doubt the payment will ever fully come back to me, but that's okay. I see it as an improvement to my fun. Buying gw2 in the first place doesn't bring me profit, but I paid for the fun.
---
They also said that you could expect raid wings in 3-4 months intervals...and that pvp updates were coming out #soon
---
Ah okay. That's interesting, thanks.
---
My exact problem with the Reaper weapons.  I think they look boss, but the green aesthetic doesn't match, or even come close to matching any of my characters.
---
My Necro has a red / blood theme, and Dark Harvest fits her look way better than the Reaper weapons.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
The problem with that mentality is that it means the system can never change in a drastic way.  Once it goes live and Anet starts selling the template slots, they can never change that really.
---
I thought there was going to be an update to the late game
---
dabbing at ludicrous speed
---
could you enlighten me then to the political message of tetris?
---
Oof
---
I've had the same question for a while. I just did some quick napkin maths, and for me to climb from 237 to 300 would require around 1890000 luck, translating to about 72 ecto stack salvages. In the current market, that is a loss of around 3456g by not direct selling those 72 stacks on the TP.
---
I simply can't see how one could argue that that is even remotely worth it.
---
Started playing GW sometiime afyer EotN was released, remember buying the bundle. Never got too much into it unfortunately.

---
They hit rock bottom and became worthless at the start of August, but they went back to 4 copper around September.
---
Maybe it's new players.
---
I've been suggesting all over the place that they should make them salvageable. 
---
For example, most of the time it could be cogs, gears and sprockets, just junk to refund the cost of salvaging, but with a chance for fractal relics.  
---
So it would not give fractal relics every time, just sometimes, keeping it from becoming too valuable, but still worth salvaging instead selling, so people would be less likely to sell them until they value gets good enough to be a good alternative to a chance for a relic, and that'll keep them more valuable. 
---
I don't think they'll do a fixed value refund like with the fractal tonic and the fractal potions, since they are not account bound. Salvaging or trading them for a RNG box will probably work better for it.
---
Out of curiosity, did this math take into account getting 1-5 Piles of Crystalline dust with the salvages?
---
I simply had to give up trying to farm with a group on thief, even when hitting mobs I wasn't getting credit, too many people either don't know or care about common courtesy when it comes to farming, and by the time you find a reasonable group you've wasted time on many of your buffs.
---
I'd heartily recommend going pew-pew deadeye, finding a quiet instance and run around farming on your own. Far more profitable in my experience. Even if someone comes in and tags up, mobs respawn fairly quickly so you can just stay away from the group and do your own thing.
---
I feel dirtied.

Guild Wars 2 is basically dead in China, but I get your point.

I've been using them for my fb, chrono, Rene. Any boon class since it's so cheap and efficient.

#FREECANTHA
---
According to Reddit and people in game, anything that doesn't have an official name (or hell, even if it does) people nickname Steve.  The elder dragon in the sea, Octovine, plenty of other world bosses.  It's cringey as hell and maybe I just see the few people who constantly just call everything Steve but it's just so dumb to see it over and over.  After the 100th thing being called "Steve" it stops being original or (if it ever was) funny.

All mount skins in the mount menu are classed as new mounts rather than skins.

Children can't reach the top shelves though. Checkmate.

I think if you press evade, dash and leap of faith fast enough you'll [change your mind about its disposability.](https://streamable.com/lo5mp)

Yup! Mesmers and thieves lose a lot of their advantage when  the terrain is not with them. Same with soul beasts and line-of-sight.
---
They didn't do a "Kralk wasn't that bad". You may have mis
---
Why wouldn't they be able to? Ingame systems like traits and wardrobe have had major reworks to them in the past, and they certainly had monetization items coupled to them...didn't stop them to change those, I don't see why this would suddenly be different for build templates.
---
I do think that the Jackal is a bit weak once you get the flight mounts, but I still often use it for ground transport because its boost is more flexible and fun. If the Raptor's jump worked ballistically then it would be better all around though. 
---
I definitely wouldn't mind them expanding the usefulness of the Jackal, at least by adding new portals to newer content areas (like snow portals or something). Or by just improving the boost refresh.
---
Plus, since it's higher off the ground, it will always seem slower relative to something on the ground.
---
Hey!  Be nice to my fangirl
---
Probably him and Hiwa.
---
You could try writing to support.  But that’s about all you can do.
---
&gt; So guys what do you think?
---
Now just need someone to put it in the wiki
---
Maybe if you think people don't deserve to enjoy earning rewards their way, you don't deserve to enjoy earning them your way?
---
That comes with the larger collision box.
---
The rollerbeetle and jackal and go through a lot of smaller holes, but the rest of the mount have troubles the bigger they get.
---
And that's a starting point. You are going to want to inflate that number by a few times over to increase your odds of getting one. You are better off selling the bags and buying the infusion
---
That's not happening tot sales man/women.
---
But by buying it with gold you are not earning it.
---
You can not compare time spent in PvP against farming pve. First of all you would also have to include the liquid gold each match and during season the rank rewards. But mostly you shouldn't because of you should do what you like. It's not a job n
---
What you should compare it to is other reward tracks. I think liquid gold it is the best even on 15 g. However other tracks give a key, or a skin. And all of them give mystic clovers aside from Halloween. It depends how you value those, they're not liquid gold.
---
Thank you! I mean, even for wanting to cover future releases :)
---
I'm not able to see the current exchange rate in game (It should be in the wiki but I couldn't find it) but the 12,500 bags shown in this pic amounts to about $33 of gems converted to gold. Just going by what I remember gems costing a few days ago.
---
Ever seen subli destroying some pug dps players heavily with her reaper? Sure enough in any optimal setup and short phase times in coordinated groups reaper is far from optimal. Still, well played it's totally fine for pug dailys. The biggest problem is, that the most reaper player play like trash and we therefore have a pre printed image ones a reaper joins up.
---
You don't join the Shining blade when you take the oath.
---
um.. yikes
---
&gt; I can't see the ROI on this
---
It's a video game and all your time spent here is time you could be working side jobs for real money. The RoI for anything in game is negative.
---
That said, this is the best time to get gold and the cheapest time investment you'll be able to put in for the ability to call a group to you whenever you want. There's been enough times in the past year I've wanted to do something small, like make a meta taxi or do a particular bounty, that I'm absolutely buying a tag first thing with my halloween gold.
---
I love how janky the dancing is.

[The Devil Went Down to Georgia intensifies]
---
It is, but also isn't.
---
The Blood Legion Homelands are the oldest territories of the Charr Homelands that were taken back by the charr from humans that we can visit in GW1. So they had less human ruins, and spent the least time called 'Ascalon', if any time at all.  
---
By the time of GW1, they have not been under human control for a long time. But one can still see remains of Ascalonian style construction. A pillar here, a bit of a road there... 
---
The Cathedral of Flames clearly shows Ascalonian architecture, and it was probably in a better state of conservation because the shaman caste repurposed it for their sham religion.
---
Then the charr brought there tons of stolen treasure from Ascalon, and turns out it was all cursed, with souls of the dead attached to them, and the strongest of them, Murakai, took over them all.
---
But they are basically part of the same territory, and share the same biome. The different naming is mostly from history.
---
Oooo
---
They _are_ spikier than Quaggans, so they have a natural advantage, and they're much more aggressive.
---
I think they'd have a better chance

I vaguely remember there being a glitch that made the weights look odd? But that's got nothing to do with the texture.

FYI, 
---
**Eve of the Mad King** you have this spelled incorrectly " acgievement  "
---
**Mad Maleficience** &lt;- that isn't spelled correctly but could be how the game is spelling (not sure).  But also at #13 under that title you have a "Forbdden" Vault
---
 **Mad Mementos**  \#3 "suspisious" location &amp; "supdue". Same suspicious issue on #5 with "watter" bucket.
---
 **Mad Memorial** \#6 -is that supposed to be Farshore?
---
 Labyrinthine Horror  &lt;- is that spelled correctly?  Thought his name was Steve not Stevette.
---
 **Pumpkin Carving**   pumpkins are in " Labytinth "
---
"when you will be done" isn't the best grammar.

Not hating on what you did.  Your eyes have reviewed it so many times that you are blind to these.  Just thought you might like the help.
---
Anet was too busy milking mount skins  to make regular engaging content for the majority of PoF
---
Is there a website that scans your material storage and determines what items would be most profitable to craft? It seemed like gw2efficieny kind of had something like that but I don’t think it’s what I’m looking for.
---
I swear, EVERYTHING in FFXIV was done better, build templates, custom UI, Glamour Plates (stored cosmetic looks), EXCEPT the combat. Gw2 wins there. Square Enix and Ncsoft need to make a game together.

I played  quite a bit back when I played, I'm not home at the moment but I do believe I have quite a few laurels, ascended mats, and gold. I was also doing fractals with exotic gear/the ascended items I do have back when I played.. and I know I got a few drops, not sure which at the moment, though.
---
But if you follow through with that example, you have to think about design: Do you really want to make and maintain a system for the most extreme power users of that system? The number of people who have that many builds is astronomically small, compared to the vast majority who either don't use templates from arc or those who have 1-3 builds per character already. It doesn't make sense to make your system that much more complex if there's almost no-one who's going to use the max out of that...especially, when those extreme power users would still have the alternative of either saving build links in a personal guild message or like in the past, have multiple characters available to hold different builds.

This is great! (: I would just say to add bookmarks at the top of the page to link to each achievement. I do love how expanding on images is really smooth compared to other websites I have used.
---
I've always been sitting at around 1k gold and then spending on fashion items, but never below 500, so I could have always afforded it, it was just so hard to justify the expense for something I wasn't sure I wanted to do. I prefer following others that know better routes and are more experienced but as you said, maybe sometimes you just want a group of people on you to do a group event. 
---
But because I am so frugal and persistent I would rather try soloing everything, and have learned and adapted my builds for solo play because of that..:) That might just seem silly to someone, but I actually enjoyed playing it like that so far (or in very small groups). But then again, on the other hand, I would feel guilty for tagging up and calling people to me if there's just some minor event I wanted to do. Or sometimes I would just wander off in the middle of the event and do something else, again I would feel guilty doing something like that. Or maybe I'm looking into this too seriously?
---
I got it for 100g back in the days.
---
It was indeed worth it, I main Guardian and for events you can tag up.
---
It helped me a lot farming Aurora and Vision, as well as other events you need to target to unlock certain metas. You can tag up and gather people, if you spam in mapchat it really gathers a large crowd asap.
---
Leading bountyruns or metas is really easy and even for the weirdest little occasion in older maps like core Tyria etc. you can find people with ease if you have commander tag.
---
My buddys ask me all the time to help them out revitalize their current map.
---
Simply tag up!
---
Well yes, probably. But it's not the topic here
---
Again, coat it the way you want, pretend to not be what it is, close both eyes and turn soud off while you play, whatever you wanna do.

Read this: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shining_Blade_Secrets
---
Quoted from the actual episode:
---
"Exemplar Mehid: You're an honored agent of the timeless Shining Blade. We may now share our secrets with you, without penalty."
---
We might not be bound to follow rules, we still took part in the most sacred ritual of a human faction .. its like putting a female human in a faharar and tell ourselves "Oh but she doesn't follow the high legions and the imperators" ..
---
or just, literally dont open viscount because its a waste of time
---
Competition requires a reason for the losing team to keep showing up in days 5, 6, and 7.
---
Losing in WvW is miserable. If you lose because your side had 10 people and the other side had 20, you'll lose that fight basically all day long.
---
When dedicated WvW players have multiple accounts on multiple worlds, they can and will coordinate to shift their time played away from blowouts and onto matches with fun gameplay.
---
Years of experience with WvW suggests that it's more likely for a loss due to 10 v 20 to snowball than to even out. It'll become 9 v 20 or 10 v 21 or 9 v 21, etc...
---
I don't think alliances can solve that. I also don't think ANet will deliver alliances in a timeframe that will matter.
---
Making gameplay fun -- especially on the losing side -- could bring players in to even up sides.
---
Additionally, ANet could and should have let guilds instantiate private copies of WvW maps for semi-organized large group play.
---
Also don't be mad for mobs being knocked away because it might be people leveling up that does it. If they didn't change that mechanic.
---
Maybe I missed some details, but I got the feeling that he was trapped by the Elder Dragon Cycle as much as we were. He didn't want to devour entire civilizations, but that was his role and his nature. This is why, even though he loved his daughter Glint, he destroyed her for opposing the Cycle. His last words, from my perspective, were a hopeful warning, praying that the new path opened by Aurene's ascension could end the Cycle another way.
---
I was in the same boat. Attempted since it was first introduce and never was able to complete it. 2 years ago I decided I was going to finish it no matter what. Watched Dulfy's video numerous times to get the path down but still was having issues. Someone suggested switching to Action Cam and I was finally able to do it. Would suggest trying with it if you aren't already.
---
I want a system that works for all users, so that this community can come together and think highly of this game.  Also, how is it more complex to simply have a different pricing model available?
---
Not that I know of, and I'd be rather surprised if they did. ANet is owned by a Korean company, so it's highly unlikely that they'd publicly support China or react as aggressively as some companies have, but they also don't want to lock themselves out of the Chinese market so they wouldn't want to publicly support Hong Kong either. Better to stay neutral unless it becomes impossible.
---
I believe they meant the average value of opening a ToT bag is 3.5s so you only lose 18g (1.8s each) doing it on alt accounts.
---
No argument from me, dude.  I made that as my original GW1 character back in 2005 when I was like 13 years old.  I'm sure when you were 13 you did some cringey shit too.  Not sure how that's relevant here though.
---
I hate bosses with special buffs. 
---
They contain instructions on how to deal with them, but in order to read them you have to deal with the frustration of them jumping around
---
Go ahead then. ;)
---
What is action cam? First person or max zoomed out?
---
Super easy!  Barely an inconvenience!  
---
Honestly though, took me about 6 tries before I got through it again this year.  Muscle memory, something great.
---
As long I have to babysit some Charr on their patrol lest they get butchered by a small group of morons that will literally worship anything, I'm going to have to agree that the Grawl are probably the rightful residents of Ascalon.  Shiverpeaks too.
---
The octovine is named P A N I C
---
95% of the reason I'm buying them is to anchor taxis for stuff like Chak Gerent or Junundu rising. If you can solo those, more power to you.
---
No game offers unlimited character slot right?
---
I never agree with Teapot but I think he is right here. This strike mission in the prologue is the first phase in effect the second phase will come in episode 1.
---
Aggroing less stuff and the HP pool being limited for a good reason. Thank you for your advice, I never thought of these things.
---
Oh. My bad, then.
---
Oh okay thanks, yeah I have never really attempted to do any Halloween achievements before so I was probably looking in the wrong place. This is a skin that I legit want though.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Teal_Branded_Mist
---
       
---
Sorry, this is the one I meant
---
You would probably want pictures of these skins too right? OK i will put it on my todo list.
---
My theory is people quit because they get bored, start planning other games or are insane like you.
---
No. He always said he wasn't leaving he just wasn't going to focus entirely on GW2 anymore.
---
Honestly, that's pretty much Ascent to Madness, isn't it?
---
It's 5-man instead of 10-man, but "strike mission" is still the most similar definition that comes to mind (compared to, let's say, dungeons or fractals)
---
REALLY hope they make them more difficult over time. Most people I know are solo'ing, or working on that haha
---
The WvW bags are much cheaper ways of getting 18 and 20 slot bags
---
You could try Dark Reader extension. Works like charm for me.
---
I never really followed his YouTube(?) stuff, but I do have him friended in the game and he is on a ton
---
doesn't necessarily add anything significant to your point, but ff14 had to fail completely, die and eventually come back from the dead first before becoming a realm reborn, question is would anet survive under the same circumstances
---
Maybe some kind of Wiki system where people can drop suggestions easily would help!
---
Lovely guide! I would also add that for the Lunatic's Fashion achievement, instead of crafting you can also get one piece of each armour from different achievements (like boots for doing the jumping puzzle and so on).
---
Wishful thinking at its best.
---
I think he hits the bull's eye when he says that people have a form of prejudice towards Raids because of other games. I think WoW did most of the work there scaring people off with that. I think absolutely anyone can beat Wing 4 simply by smashing their heads off the headboard.
---
What did I missed?
---
just a few things imo worth considering:
---
- sooner or later they are gonna have to add an aerodrome-like area for these. walking over to the portal feels like it takes more time than the actual mission already.
---
- while it is a reused instance and it doesn't have significantly tuned mechanics, it still is a fully designed raid-quality encounter with unique abilities and visuals. that is arguably the hardest and most time consuming aspect of raid design (that had to come from *somewhere*).
---
- rewards are pure RNG based. that is already bad, but ANets implementations of that are notorious for being insufferable. this needs a token system to reduce frustration.
---
- fuck unskippable RP dialogue in *daily* content that prevents any form of progress.
---

see this is why i struggle in this game sometimes, i am conditioned to think i am supposed to stay out of red circles
---
I'm sorry it doesn't work for you, I can't get the hang of the beetle mount at all and I must've tried 50 times :D  
---
It could be that they hotfixed the bug, however I haven't received any response from ANet so I have no idea.
---
It might be orange circle, I don't remember :D.
---
to be fair i avoid both, i have no idea which effects i am supposed to avoid or not, i mean i find it even harder when a boss does a move that doesn't have a circle because i struggle to concentrate on boss animations and all the other things happening.. but that i am supposed to stand in a circle? that was a new one for me, thanks for the explanation
---
Yeah its best to get Berserker anyways because you will most definitly need it rather sooner then later.
---
All classes make use of Berserker set!
---
It doesn't land on its own though, only if you're outside of its flight canopy. You can hover indefinitely (I think? I mean I haven't tried for more than a few minutes.)
---
I really hate the random clinging. I wish there was a separate "cling" button so it doesn't cling on its own.
---
This is why you don’t keep your vibrator in the quiver
---
&gt; GW2's raiding atmosphere is infamously extremely elitist
---
You are trying too hard to paint Raids as something they are not. Frankly you should give an effort to understand the meaning of "elitist" and "elitism", because most of the time people babble absolute nonsense.
---
or preplexity runes
---
I'm playing a Minstrel Healbrand and tag up in current events as commander.
---
Its nice being a Tank / Heal and at the same time active commander. This way I can protect those that come and help me out doing those giant metas.
---
If you get commander yourself you most definitly want to get tanky gear asap. If you die too often in those clusterfuck AoE fiestas nowadays thats a real bummer if you're commander.
---
If you're a Tank you can lead groups and help others out. Nobody plays groupsupport in open world! On my alt chars I can tag up and support because I know my commander tag will attrackt some people so a real support build like Alac Rene, Chronomancer, Healbrand, Scourge etc. will help my group the most.
---
If you have commander you don't need to run dps or an open world solo sustain build. You can and should most definitly help your team and be a full Support / Healer (with a little bit of tank to help with selfsustain). This way you can take on much tougher bosses!
---
Also if you do play healer / support to face difficult events - you can't afford to die, if you die your team wipes as well. Trust me I've seen that often. Thats why imo Minstrel Healbrand is the best role to tag up and lead a team, you have strong buffs and a ton of healing / groupsustain. Hence Healbrand is picked as THE group support in WvW!!!
---
That was what I thought. Is it even worth going through the world with underleveled basic specs and stupid newbie gear? When I could just cut through the boring process, get my mounts, rush through the story chapters and farm the end game gear right off the bat.
---
I'm not trying hard at all, it's widely known that the GW2 raiding community is elitist.
---
Not my fault the bootlickers from here forgot or won't acknowledge it anymore.
---
if you buy path of fire you get heart of thorns for free so you won't need to buy both expansions, so purchase PoF and use the rest for a gem code to buy the living story episodes
---
Infamous? Have you seen WoW? How about FFXIV? they are infamous. Asking for a meta build and a bit of KP to prove you know the fight isnt elitist. Dont have the KP? Go learn the boss via a raid training guild or by yourself running a training run, you'll quickly realize why "Training run, all welcome fuck the meta" will **never** clear cairn, which is the easiest boss let alone any other bosses. Pug it via a semi-exp run or run it with a guild. No group of 9 players who only have enough time to clear one wing is going to take you on to wipe for an hour on the easiest boss because you dont know the fight, the attacks and make it a lot harder on them while you are pulling 200 dps and pulling dps from boss be ause you are down more than you are up, that's what training runs are for.
---
FFXIV raiding atmosphere is pretty chill actually. So no, not every raiding atmosphere is elitist. Especially when compared with GW2's. The LFG is a massive blob of "Get this much to raid with us", effectively locking a lot of people out of the content they offer.
---
I believe http://www.gw2profits.com/ is what you're looking for.
---
Just contact support and ask them to undelete it?
---
so how does ff prevent wiping to the first boss for 48 hours and more?
---
Deleting a different character probably?
---
I thought there was, but I can't find it. Perhaps my mind is playing tricks on me.
---
[This site](https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/#browse) sorts all the skins by release, so if you know when you stopped you can piece it out. If you put in your API key you have probably a clearer picture.
---
If you are really hardcore, you can [look on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release) to piece togheter what you missed from the big releases, but will probably miss smaller skins like the ones from the black lion chests.
---
I hope this helps, even just a little bit :)
---
I think the age resets when they restore your character. But hopefully I am wrong.
---
I once accidentally bought an item from the gem store that I already owned. I was trying to buy the other skin that was in rotation at the time, but I spaced out super hard.  
---
I was super tired after a stupid long shift at work, these things happen.
---
open 3k and got 2 pink polys lel
---
Strike missions have a lot of potential but just a general queue system is more needed. If we do anything in this game, we have to use LFG. Why do we not have a automated system for players who want to just queue and go? You won't be able to refine your group with a LFG message but the convenience would be so insanely high.
---
I'm not asking for myself. My friends are asking and both of them are dirt poor. It's not about being stingy. Thank you for your response though !
---
I'm not sure, I remember that some point, the PoF was sold for 15dollars.
---
I don't see any positives in this. All SM's "merits" either could be implemented in raids (reused assets, progressive difficulty (WHICH DOESN'T MEAN EASY MODE RAIDS), updates to encounters, excluive rewards that scale with perfomance, complex mechanics, story context) or come from their mindblowingly low difficulty (accessibility (EASY MODE RAIDS GO HERE), possiblity of lfr, lack of prejudice towards raids (because so called "casuals" actually must know what they are going for, when aiming for hi end coordinated pve content) etc) . The only way for strike missions to evolve is to lose the second quality and become raids (kinda shitty bite sized one-boss raids, but ok), and we already see that a-net doesn't want raids and raid-capable community in their game anymore. So yeah, strike missions will just stay like this, easy low effort rng-based daily farm.
---
He kinda lost me at "mixed feelings regarding recently added strike missions" (third word in the video)  tbh. Yeah. Mixed. Sure.
---
I like the concept, I see potential, but does Anet see it? 
---
I don't like that Freezy the Snowman killed more players than a being corrupted by Jormag.
---
Which parts aren't on the wiki? I thought there were only like a couple new achievements or something this year?
---
It looks really fantastic. Great work!
---
I don't care
---
  
---
Go cry that people have opinions on the internet somewhere else
---
been a long day and I was deleting a diff character. didn't even think as i typed the name. the longer im at uni the dumber i get :(
---
Hey at least those were somewhat meta at one point I think  
---
I almost had a heart attack when they broke Pack runes for like a week with the changes to "on hit" effects
---
The other week during the wvw livestream, nightmare said that the overhall statistics of the strike were positive and he was personally asking feedback and ideas in chat. I believe they've seen the light.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/492728263 at 27 minutes.
---
Okay, I didn't even know that HoT being free if you purchase PoF is still happening. Thank you :D
---
Wow that’s cool. TIL.
---
I have more beef with the waiting. People are upset that build templates have 3 layers of monetization. Well guess what. The JP has 5 layers of waiting. At 3 points during the JP, then after doing the JP, and then waiting for the PvP round to finish (last 2 minutes). About half of it is waiting. I'd like to play the game. Garbage.
---
Thanks for the vid. I'm liking the slow addition of basic wall and floor panel decorations. I'm slowly able to make more ambitious builds.
---
And people have survived, both in Guild wars, and in real life, heavily burnt and missing a limb or two. When people arrive at a scene of a crash, they don't just look at a bloodied body and state that he's dead just by looking.
---
Besides, Balthazar slammed the commander in the face with a massive fireball that burnt them for the short period it took them to die. It's impossible for them to arrive and see a pristine commander body laying there.
---
Thank you Loco :).
---
Cheers thanks for the reply. Good to hear that there's some build variety in Necromancers as a result of the result balance patch.
---
You are welcome :).
---
Wish you luck!
---
True but my point was to illustrate why it still lives on to some degree long past it's developmental expiration date while Gw2 won't.
---
Supposing Anet released both as single player games that didn't need a connection to servers to play, only Gw1 would offer any real enjoyable experience thanks to the hero/henchmen system and a fairly reasonable drop rate for items.  
---
Gw2 in full dead in the water, "maintenance mode" would be nearly impossible to sell to a new potential player while Gw1 could conceivably
---
A few reflects and the glitter puke mechanic can make him kill himself in under a minute. You don't even have to have "proper damage options", just 5 seconds to swap out missile reflect as the fight starts.
---
&gt; None of those would have anything to do with "a huge part of their playerbase" though. I mean, the game could lose everyone who plays any of that content and nobody would really notice. 
---
The best thing about GW2 is the end game content the game offers. Having high-level end game content is the sole reason why there is a consistent player base in the first place. If you take that out, people will get bored of doing metas and map completing.
---
The biggest criticism for Path of Fire is the lack of Metas yielding very good rewards. People were getting sick and tired of farming Aruic Basin, and Dragon Stand day in and day out. PoF lacked any of that. Hence why most bounties lack players unless it's a daily.
---
In league of legends, top players consist of a very small portion of the player base. Lol Esports makes a boatload amount of money. If all the top players left because the game got too stale, then league would suffer from a decreasing population.
---
Disagree, they're about half a step up from people who don't CC anything ever.
---
hmm wtf then
---
I don't think "several magnitudes" means what you think it does ;).
---
Of course, we do not have official player count, but judging from Reddit statistic for corresponding subreddits, WoW has about 6x more players - that's not remotely close even to two orders of magnitude (i.e. 100 times more)
---
I think I read that support in that case undid this for others, try!
---
Reminds me of me screwing up recently by buying 500 Piles of Compost Starter. Only I typed in the "500" in the field to buy them, didn't remember that you buy stacks of 10 and clicked the confirmation "ok" just by habit too fast for my brain to catch up. Guess what's now still sitting in my bank: quite a few big, stinky piles of sh.. .
---
&gt; It is recommended to disable "Autoloot: Quick Interact" to avoid  immediately looting the chest when it spawns, giving you time to put on  the ghostly aura.

I kinda lived in fear of this for a while. My characters' names differ in a single grammatical sign (ó vs. o for example). Needless to say I stopped doing this for frequently deleted slots such as key farming. Now, why would I do it in the first place I do not know.
---
I wouldn't say pristine either. But when you say mangled, I can't imagine a burn on your face or a burnt arm. Mangle is more like a bear turning you into shredded noodles. And I doubt we would have been missing a limb either. Ressurection would NOT have restored our missing limb. The magic was to restore our bodies spark, allowing our spirit to re-inhabit it, but it wouldn't regrow a limb. Just look at how healing functions now in the world. Healers literally have to bind your wounds and give you medicine and use low-end healing magic because all the crazy hoopla from 250 years ago is gone.
---
Oh no it's not a problem at all so no need to apologise. 
---
In some ways I'm glad the scarf is pretty unnoticeable so I don't have to grind it for hours at a time.
---
I run on 250 ping and had this problem only on sylvari character's. Was in several different zones for my testing across 4 characters.
---
That was HARDLY "loud" music.

You can get it for$20 here
---
I think I got it from the daily chest that pops up in the corner.
---
Touche.
---
yeah, pretty easily actually. It's just an HP barrier, the mechanics can be negated in a lot of ways. If you can hit 20k/s dps and not fuck up the mechanics it's easy. My full raid group can clear it in about two and a half minutes including the run there.
---
Arguably Foodlike should be 300 candy corn, not 150.
---
Might make a note that there's 3 chests on the Clock Tower run as well.
---
Under Mad Memorial, it should be Lunatic *Fashion*.
---
Great guide overall, thanks for putting this work in!
---
they'll most likely stick to the first four for packs like that because those mounts are more accessible.  
---
The others might get single releases or have some skins in licenses.
---
I guess maybe you forgot something. When you come and see a tag already on map. It means, maybe, that there's somebody here who's trying to have fun while leading a loop. So, don't light on your own tag. It's not usefull. At all. 
---
Thanks OP for this sub. 
---
Have fun everybody ! o/
---
If you read my comment again you'll hopefully read what I actually wrote, unless nuance is beyond you, as it sounds like you've misunderstood my comment.
---
If we look at twitch viewers, it is closer to 100 times more. Do you actually think WoW only has 6x more players than gw2?
---
So Evon caught a bunch of Forged and shove a pumpkin on em?
---
Thanks for the unboxing pictures. :)
---
Everyone knows its a business, but let me buy expansions or extra content, not necessary updates to UI.
---
Arenanet has shifted to caring more about gemstore than game itself because else is free. Its saddening to understand that no more major updates are coming.
---
Fractals and raids. Last fractal was over 8 months ago (supposed to be one per 6 months) and we’ve had no word about any new raids being produced. In fact I’ve heard rumors from people who would know that they’re not working on any raids at all and currently not planning on it
---
Hate to break it to you but every game has elitists, and every gamemode has elitists, as well as nirmal plebs who take it chill. You dont just suddenly turn into flaming hot mess when you Waypoint to aerodome.

In [The Battle for Khylo](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Battle_for_Kyhlo) Devona's father straight up dies and gets Rebirth'd onto the castle wall.

The problem could be that you are a ghost at the end of the path, maybe that overwrote the effect from the food.

People that like to gamble.
---
The idea of the boss evolving over time is a great idea when it comes to teaching people mechanics. 
---
The worst thing imo about pugging a dungeon/raid in an mmo is the experience of going in for the first time and knowing absolutely nothing of the potentially massive amount of mechanics, especially when they bog your team down massively.
---
It makes people more comfortable if they are introduced to things slowly and are given opportunity to learn one step at a time.
---
omg, I love it!!! &lt;3
---
It's not people getting toxic, it's people being toxic in general. In competitive scenarios it's where this aspect of a player shows itself.
---
My issue with that is those certain types with a disposition of obsessively doing things over and over for rewards. The same people that stay up 40 hours straight on release night of a popular rpg just to farm as much as possible. These people need something to tell them enough is enough. These people are also notoriously elitist and exclusionary, so I doubt they'd be willing to jump in with newer people that will waste their time learning new bosses versus one shorting them. These are the people to consider when making content repeatable.
---
PvP isn't too bad actually, but the botting, afking and wintrading is a serious issue for sure. I've made posts about them in the past but it's certainly something anet needs to fix to really begin improving the gamemode.
---
Sounds about right, eft subreddit normally stops complaining 20 minutes into the next wipe
---
It  took me three years to beat the thing the first time and usually another couple of hours to figure it out again every time it comes back
---
I think you took the point of a general post about the community and twisted it to fit your agenda. i.e. making your reply specifically about build templates instead of actually reading the post and applying what was said to the community st large.
---

---
shooter camera (not necessary first person, but it's really similar, your mouse controls the camera and where your character is looking and you have an aiming dot),  really cool for open world random play. Sadly skills that "need a target" can't be used aiming this way (you can right click the enemy to target them tho)
---
Not a fan of your comics, but I do enjoy this picture, a lot.
---
+1
---
Congrats! The case looks pretty cool.
---
Really nice way of showing the weapons, a lot better than what dulfy did. Keep it up!
---
Good point,
---
obviously anyone would look like an idiot trying to define a normal player, but I'm willing to say the majority of people I play with in-game have owned the game with release, don't spend a lot of time posting on the forums, certainly don't agree with everything Anet releases but nonetheless will share their opinions without making demands from the company or trying to sensationalize their posts to emorionally charge the reader into agreeing with their point of view, especially if their opinion would be considered "unpopular".
---
Simply put, people who don't let every decision a company makes define their happiness and control their emotions because they are busy enjoying the experience that the company provides them, rather than listening and believing everything they're told from people who have no experience in the field.
---
&gt; They would be the primary users of such a system and so many have left for other MMO's that are offering what they actually want. 
---
I so want to disagree with this.
---
Only... I write this while playing FF14. Ahem.
---
hahaha thierin i know what u mean but that event on sunday is to cater to the people who have spent large amounts on there fashion so this is why i do multiple events for fashion wars to include everyone. Such as todays event for cosplay! next weeks fashion wars will be for duo fashion wars partners! I'm still very excited to see the high class event on sunday!
---
Did you eyeball this or use a template? I'd love to recreate it but I'm artistically handicapped.
---
 Congratz!

\[off topic\] Friendly FYI: F6/PrintScr keys are default for taking in game screenshots. They will be placed in your User/Documents/Guild Wars 2 folder.

Thank you for your input, I'll make  sure to prepare a simplified english version of this post in the nearest future.
---
Is this legit?
---
I tried but didn’t see the “screenshot sent to [file name]
---
Yup. Whenever something doesn't go their way. Can be in open world meta's as well.
---
100% you got it right for all of pvp. I havnt had much trouble with toxic people in pvp except when those situations show up
---
Okay, I am currently talking to my friend and he asked me if he buys PoF, will get get HoT directly?
---
I’d be happy finishing it once....
---
I once got flamed at Chak Gerent for not saying how much hp it has after first phase while tagging up. People are amazing.
---
Yes it is. Official retailer.
---
If he buys the key, will he also get heart of throne?
---
Oh I didn't think about that. I remember farming a mastery cavern somewhere in PoF maps (several rooms full of mobs, with jackal portals in between), kinda annoying. Think it was last year.
---
Thank you so much. I appreciate it !
---
Exactly. The problem I find is people will often try to change the argument and make it about something else the company has done "wrong" instead of admitting their own fault and changing for the better. It's as if people are natural liars and have never been held accountable before.
---
&gt;PvP isn't too bad actually
---
Yay for PvP!
---
&gt;but the botting
---
&gt;AFKing
---
&gt;wintrading
---
*pikachu face*
---
I’m using a lvl 80 berserker staff on my condi scourge lol. Sometimes doesn’t do enough damage to count as tagging things though. :(
---
hello /u/AugmentedPenguin,
---
The majority of matches my friends and I have in PvP don't include the afore-mentioned issues, but they are still problems that must be addressed if the game wants a serious competitive scene.
---
A dick right out of the gate XD and wrong too.
---
[&amp;CmsgAAA=] apparently.  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Luminous_Heavy_Pauldrons
---
You're not correct, but you're not entirely incorrect.
---
I used the phrase "properly understood" to show that I mostly understood what the boons etc did, but not entirely. Meaning that I had a working knowledge of the boons/conditions I could apply to myself and others, but not of boons that were foreign to me like aegis or alacrity. Ergo I didn't know the full complement of boons as I hadn't seen all of them yet. At that point it was an "unknown unknown"
---
To address your main point: I never said that I couldn't read debuff descriptions because they disappear too quickly. That wasn't in my comment. However I concede that it was implied, and that it is more or less true.
---
For context I'll give you a better insight to the situation.
---
During the first few months of me playing the game, whenever new boons or conditions appeared I would try to mouseover to read them, but after the first few dissapeared too quickly to read I gave up trying. 
---
I played my necromancer for the first few months, leveling her up, having a lovely time, and knowing how boons and condis worked didn't matter cause I wanted to have fun attacking mobs with my minion army.
---
I never considered looking up stuff because I had no need for it. I was having a good time playing a game I liked.
---
When breakbars became important, I made sure I understood the relevant mechanics, including boons/condis and so on.
---
In conclusion, I feel that you "laughing at my ineptitude" was both rude and out of place.
---
&gt; ANet employee decided to make it not possible to reach the follow run in time.
---
Yup this part is quite annoying. Should have a few seconds to restart, instead of having to wait a full run time (less only if others are bad) in the lobby between each completion ...
---
no
---
No, I'm saying GW2 competitive PvP is a joke.  Everything from skill balance decisions to GM punishment for breaking rules like wintrading.  Same with WvW, there is no desire to address issues others complain about for years.  People have left both these modes.  PvE is the only focus now, since that's where they can monetize the most content.
---
Both achievements seem to be buggy - yesterday I ran Teq with autoloot turned off. Chest spawns, eat strawberries until I'm a ghost, loot chest manually.. no credit. The achievement specifically says "loot the chest"
---
Ignore jealous people. Just promise you'll keep it in good condition!
---
Except its been this way for years. If you think the reward structure of this game is good then I guess you love Anet. If someone is doing their job badly you normally let them go. This is one of those situations. 
---
Also don't forget, our most recent patch has been one of the best and its with a new set of devs after laying off a bunch of older ones. New blood gives new results and this game needs more of it.
---
Teapot’s playthrough of the story and strike mission killed me. I love his positivity and drive for the game.
---
“All right boys let’s see what we’ve got. Oh no, they’re making us RP.”
---
I’ll do my best I promise
---
yes watch them fix dungeons
---
Or you can just list them at 10 silver...domt necessarily have to keep them in inventory.
---
That damn upper left corner of the labyrinth map.
---
This is why I run full Minstrel heal Scrapper like WvW here. Literally had his scenario play out and I just spammed heals and reflect.
---
google images. held my phone close to it and used a pumpkin sharpie to sketch it prior to carving
---
all the logos inside + that big knob + some strange thing make it look bad, at least for my taste. change that and then it would be a way better looking watch.  
---
might as well run arround with a mikey mouse watch. &lt;_&lt;
---
Believe it or not, there are some people out there who can't even afford to put thirty dollars in a game. There are some people who get paid around 300 500 dollars a month and use that money to feed their family. Be a bit more empathetic.
---
&gt;I would pay for new elite specs.
---
Don't give them ideas.
---
Okay but if it *did happen* my character couldn't fight against humans. I understand the pc in the game is basically the most bland nothing-bag of a character you could have but I can dream that he has some connection to his people. The point is that I never got to choose to join a human faction and now that is part of the pc's identity even though that episode was garbage filler.
---
I just like to share that info when I notice these posts just in case people don't know about the in game functionality.  I promise I did not mean it personally :)
---
Thank you for putting this together!
---
Nothing to do with autoloot.
---
Wasn’t taken personally. Part of my bad picture was not knowing if there was a timer at the end.
