In the books its said that Jormag freezes his victims in ice where they are slowly brainwashed and corrupted.
---

---
It is also said that when fighting his champions people will hear whispers that drive them mad.
---
Destiny's Edge found some way of blocking it through a material that they applied via tattoos.

---
As a lark, I just rattled this off to a friend of mine:
---
"Experimental Gliders" - With this buff, gliders gain height during the fight with Xera as in the final instance of LS3E5.
---
The old jetpack bug, reintroduced as a *feature*!
---
Which does bring up another thought for me. These could be introduced as training wheels. Each one you add reduces the rewards, but help you crutch past some of the more difficult mechanics of the fight.
---
For example: Soulless Horror - one buff could make the wall deal some damage and put conditions on the player instead of instant death. Another could increase the tanking time for the two tanks (inverse of the CM.) Yet another could make the tormented dead pools smaller, and/ or remain in place for a shorter duration. As you get used to dealing with a mechanic, you can start leaving that wheel off for better rewards, until - Tadaa! You can do the thing!
---
Stealth Mount would be nice
---
This
---
That's the power of spiral energy, Kralkatorrik!  JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK WE ARE?!
---
If only one of the things the commander said to rally the troops was "Believe in the me that believes in you."
---
No it's really not. It's still currency conversion in a micro economy. I've had minor impacts on gem prices as well. You can see it will a conversion of a couple thousand gems.
---
lol Good point.
---
Yes i knew taimi mount was coming!
---
Can just make a spider that is a mix of the spider guild race web grapple and the LS3 Drac Mons special ability so you can swing around places--only because the spider race ability is too OP on its own.
---
Eh frankly as long as its good content I wouldn't mind waiting just a bit.
---
Especially if it comes with a trait/weapon/utility rework to make more use of diviner gear.
---
Well...Why not an Underwater mount?! I'm thinking a jellyfish type thing or seahorse looking thing. Then again...maybe not. But let's look at the mounts we already have to see what niche could be filled: 
---
1. Raptor- fast ground movement, long jumps
---
2. Skimmer- hovers, can allow movement over water
---
3. Jumpy Bunny- very high jumps
---
4. Jackal- multi directional jumps/ dodges
---
5. Griffon- long sustained air gliding
---
6. Roller Beetle- incredibly fast ground travel
---
So...what niches does that leave? 
---
-Maybe some kind of gathering mount? (But that would maybe be  an unfair advantage to non PoF people...dunno). I can't see them doing this as it may upset the game economy...
---
-Some kind of diving, underwater mount? This would allow fast underwater traveling and that's all...
---
-A mount that can climb/ hold onto walls? If we're going further to the shiverpeaks, maybe that would make sense?
---
-Maybe a Moa mount? A LA Chocobo? Moas have always been in GW and can get pretty big...maybe big enough to ride. Not sure what they're purpose would be though...maybe some kind of stealth ability for safe traveling?
---
I'm not sure what other kind of ability we would need with a mount right now..unless Anet create some other kind of map mechanics or geography that necessitates new abilities in the form of a mount...Exciting though...wonder how many mounts we'll have in the end. I think part of the problem with mounts is that...once you start making them, it's hard to find a reason to STOP because there are always new cool ideas.
---
I hope everyone remembers how pissed they were during the first 2 years that trahearn got the spotlight and we always were the number two. 
---
they changed that and now we have the standard RPG story. :D
---
Mats are a much smaller pool. MUCH. The gems pool is one big pool for the entire game , for one commodity. Not tens of thousands of different mats each being speculated seperately.
---
If there wasn't a release of some skins, or items then it was probably 1 player unless a bunch of players got an idea in mind to manipulate the economy for something which can happen in trade guilds.
---
Not going to say the trick to enjoying scourge since otherwise Anet will probably nerf it.
---
like a butterfly!
---
&gt; Dolyak mount: can carry two or more players at once;
---
This one I don't get though. What is the point of carrying other people beside you? Couldn't they also use that mount instead being depended on other person? If the sole reason why we should use this mount is because other players can join then I am out. 
---
You can't even hide gloves on the "newer" outfits, and they don't come with toys any more. D:

Good pep talk. I'll try to not be the worst necro ever.
---
I doubt it was either of those for such a large spike. Even when a hot seller like character slots and shared inventory go on sale , and everyone buys gems at the same time , it moves like 10-20 gold. not 110 all at once. It was more likely a glitch.
---
Tomb indeed. I don't think the map break is possible anymore, but I may be wrong.
---
What's ttgl?
---
&gt; On one hand, I absolutely adore the idea of a Golem suit Mount, but on the other it presents a bit of a logistical problem: access to it would need to be tied to S4E6, but it wouldn't make sense for players without the episode to not have it seeing as it's, you know, Taimi.
---
Not really. We got the beetle mount that is exclusive s4e3.
---
Plus it's not like they ever late gameplay get in the way of the lore.
---
A crystal phantasmal copy of aurene maybe?
---
So, [repost for karma](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ag9ypc/story_driven_rpgs/)?

&gt; We have a high speed land racer, a medium speed land racer, a high maneuverability medium speed land racer
---
Beetle, raptor and jackal in that order?
---
Scourge seems fun too, but not as tanky and fancy moves as Reaper :D
---
I just logged into my character for the first time in years. I'm stuck falling through an empty void. The stuck command doesn't do anything. Is there any way out besides waiting days for a GM to reply?
---
I don't think so, he was attacking and used LB2 while having condis on
---
This Might also come with Lunar New Year patch too..
---
Well, that sounds like a Bus right now. xD Sorry I just had to. But actually that would be pretty cool. Especially in Open World.. how many times has there been a situation you had to show someone the way and they run wrong or something else that happens. Now, you could just drag them along on the mount.
---
Next episode spoilers:  we find out that for every norn in the word, there is a matching dwarf that can merge with him into a megazord.  
---
If Lunar New Year drops with this, balance patch will probably hit at the same time.  If not then balance patch will be with Lunar New Year like it was last year.
---
I mean, you'd never know that was an exchange between guild mates or anything, but ok.
---
The first server switch is free as far as I know, so if your friend hasn't done that already then they should be able to switch for free once.
---
I'm not. For me, 4 jewels total is the plan, and 5 is a good day.
---
They already nerfed a bunch of racials because people bitched about them or something. Probably human players because they have crappy ones.
---
There 2 complete free sets of new weapons this episode?!
---
Same with armor last episode
---
If by "mad" you mean crazy, then probably not, the commander is always portrayed as sane.... well, as sane as a person fighting gods and dragons can be. If by "mad" you mean pissed off enough to hijack a skypirate ship and ram it in to his (vigorously stabbed/poked) eyeball, then maybe? I mean the commander has been shown to be a little bit of a hothead.
---
Personally I would very much like to hijack a goddamn airship and fly it in to that overgrown healing crystals eyes. 
---
I wouldn't be too surprised if we end up sitting in a bar somewhere, drunk off our asses and taimi comes to try n cheer us up, but we tell her to fuck off. Then caithe comes in with some kinda "go to the mists to find aurenes soul and we fix this somehow" plan. Desperate to save their little baby, the commander and caithe rally the group to go to the mists.
---
God I hope someone will come by with a stupid "go fight the emissary of grenth for Aurenes soul" plan.
---
Uh, we got 2 weaponsets with this LS, last LS we got 2 armor sets, Daybreak gave us 2 weapon sets too.... and there's various standalone pieces too here and there.  
---
A few months back we got the weapon contest winner weapons, those 3 were all obtainable in game doing stuff. 
---
You obviously haven’t played the last two episodes. 
---
Oh - the _same_ character has to finish the episode first? I see it now in wiki that this is indeed a prerequisite for all those quests which didn't work. Guess that also explains why I fail so often with story AP's - my Alts simpy did nearly all the quests which don't require that by now and I never realized this requirement. Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; This wiki pretty much states the opposite.
---
No it doesn't. *"four-legged equines which are presently not seen in the accessible regions of Tyria."*
---
&gt; Horses exist in Tyria
---
No, horses *existed* in Tyria. There's no evidence they currently exist.
---
Hahaha phone auto correct.
---
It's because the Forgotten build both Tarir and the Hall of Monuments (which the Ascension is bases its aesthetics off of)
---
Yeah. The weapon collections are a huge mess too, I don't know what they were thinking. They just feel rushed and half-assed.
---
Okay, you ran out of time. Can you go back and make them better now?
---
Oh yeah, makes sense. Guess the cool glass is also in the Hall of Ascension inside Augury Rock (just less rainbow than the egg chamber and the back item).
---
The "jump into hole in the ice" achievement could have been a beetle adventure too.
---
The bounties in the last map were raid escapees, so it's not like they can't make up some excuse to shove something in.
---
Not true. Plenty achieves are repeatable. Some daily, some weekly. We had monthly ones once.
---
So if they want to make the different levels of raids to give different rewards and be repeatable at different times, all they need to do is create a set of achievements that are a mix of the ones in the last LS instance (activating buffs remove the eligibility) with daily/weekly/monthly achievements and set the rewards on them.
---
What do you mean?
---
Unexpected in my mind is basically left to "we lack underwater/ multiple people". That said I'm actually expecting a straight up either bulky or slow yet"safe mount. Legit expecting Junudu wurm personally.  
---
A full ascended set is only a 7% stat increase. Exotics work just fine but elitist will tell you to only run ascended.
---
&gt; It's like ArenaNet want to create a single-player game where everything happens once, but then also have to throw in massive grinds to pay the bills.
---
This has been the sad case since PoF, which was a glorified single player expansion.
---
Hear me out, ArenaNet. If I wanted to play a single player game, there's dozens of better alternatives out there. This is supposed to be a social multiplayer experience, for fuck's sake.
---
I don't find raids that dificult, but I find really hard to get a full 10 man group. I live in NZ and don't have a lot of time to play daily, so timezone and time constrains make it hard to form a group.  I do play fractal cm often and find them harder than most raids,  but easier to find 4 people than 9.
---
That one should have been a bounty.
---
I get that bounty hunts are terrible and really need improvements, but just throwing them away in exchange of normal events won't help either.
---
Really? Because that's the majority of what people are posting.
---
When those freaking ears came out as wings for the glide, I lost it. 
---
Speaking of nodes, why are all nodes we got so far mining nodes? Really grinds my gears.
---
Its almost like reddit isnt filled with people only holding the same opinion 
---
I'm thinking of picking up the game again. I really want to do raiding and dungeons with my mesmer.
---
Are there any big changes to the meta or mesmers specifically soon? The last two times I've tried playing again, as soon as I learned my character and bought all my gear, there was some change and I had to relearn everything. Which basically killed my interest in the game. 
---
tl:dr Are there any big changes coming to the meta or mesmers soon? 
---
How about Mantra's are precast on map load. Full recast on death is fine. Incentive on not dying. I hate loading into  a map an casting 3-5 mantras before I do anything else. Mesmers that use mantras, this would be for you too. 
---
inb4 she comes back wearing all black and channeling the power of Rytlock Brimstone, the legendary revenant stance
---
I understand everyone wants to be the hero, and so do I, but probably the most heroic I have ever felt in the game was when Lion's Arch was attacked by Scarlet and we had to go in to save everyone, and then defend the beach and finally go derail the invasion at the core with raiding Scarlet's stronghold.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
To me, this picture is the embodiment of EPIC: [https://orig00.deviantart.net/b290/f/2014/063/0/d/lion\_s\_arch\_\_enemy\_controlled\_\_by\_guildwars\_2-d78yca9.png](https://orig00.deviantart.net/b290/f/2014/063/0/d/lion_s_arch__enemy_controlled__by_guildwars_2-d78yca9.png)
---
i really can't explain it but if I had to, the idea of us, running in into a city being bombarded with corrosive gas and explosives, crawling with enemies, breaching the beach and defending it agaisnt all odds, only to come together as a group to take it down. 
---
I have never been a solo RPG kinda guy, I dont like being "the chosen one", I like being another soldier that has just achieved a lot through hard work and will power, basically, keep it "humble", but most video games throw you right into being general/commander of armies and powerful allies after a couple of "deeds", when said allies are doing similar or greater deeds but nobody sucks up to them, it just doesnt feel "earned". 
---
With that being said, I like that the story hasnt made us all authoritive as of late, and I do feel we have earned being high ranked in the GW2 universe (core story ranking did feel forced to me though), other characters have, well, character, rather than just being an appendix to us who follow us because, well, because.
---
I really, REALLY, hate the chosen one trope. To make things worse, GW2 executed it worse than poorly with the stupid commander role.
---
Imagine if we had been rookies instead, getting a small group of allies across our journey, then joining the Pact as a squad. We would get to kill dragons too, but no one would recognize us for it, just our fellow soldiers and the NPC hero leading the whole operation.
---
Then we can leave active duty and walk around the world, and everyone we meet ingame thinks we're just another dumb adventurer, not the DRAGONSLAYER GODKILLER who happens to be wasting his time at some shitty annual festival.
---
You could tune it up even further, and make our RPG characters fit specific roles in the story. So, instead of total freedom on character creation, which almost always leads to shitty character development, we get fixed slots (shy slender female human, fat lazy male charr, etc) which we can fill, each getting a spot in the story. Then those characters (our characters) can all play together in the story, each player playing as one story character (with its own character customization, but the same personality and plot).
---
Whatever. I just hope someone gets this right some day.
---
*Some day.*
---
Let's hope we don't have to go to the third dragon. Cure-ne.
---
Eh...I'm pretty sure the magic is pure, and not attuned in anyway. Dragons don't seem particularly interested in what a lich considers immortality when they live insanely long already. The plot is mostly going toward finding a way to not kill the Elder Dragons, because it creates power vacuums the other Elder Dragons adamantly try to fill.
---
You mean deformed centaurs.
---
So no under water mount because that is what we are expecting.
---
The Trahearne hate was blown out of proportion because of memes. In fact, our characters was even worse at release.
---
We literally joined an order, and ranked up with every story mission (oh, you're now a lightbringer, just a few days after joining, wow much skill!). Then we just get named second in command of the world's united army, because fuck why not.
---
not the shoulders. Only the helmet and sometimes the gloves.
---
if it's a single asset, then why is it you can turn the headgear off? why is it that the shoulderpiece can be [equipped as a standalone piece](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Braham%27s_Wolfblood_Pauldrons)?
---
To be honest if you've got the gold you could just buy the Glyphs that give those bonus materials, as they reworked *all* gathering tools (though ones existing before the change like the Watchwork Mining Pick would have to be converted by talking to a certain NPC in Lion's Arch) and slot them into your pre-existing tools.
---
Unlike runes or sigils, Glyphs can be removed or added at will (so you could slot in the Watchwork glyph onto a logging tool and get sprockets as you cut trees).
---
Condition tempest is not optimal enough to be a  main build. Condition Weaver and Power Tempest are the other main builds.
---
All i can say is; I don’t know
---
Ascended has the ability to add Agony Resistance... only required in Fracs. Plus the small stat boost, but it’s totally not mandatory. 
---
It's barely a difference. Bitterfrost frontier has quite easily obtainable trinkets though and fractals/laurels/guild commendations are by far the easiest way to get ascended trinkets with core stats. 
---
Server will likely be phased out of relevance soon enough and wont be something people have to pick, since, as others have said, they are only important for WvW
---
they don't even have to make them different for each type of armor. They can literally just let all 3 armor classes use them. (I mostly say this because I have to use outfits for my medium armor class characters. Their armor aesthetic is abysmal unless you are going for a trench coat or cobbled armor look.)
---
Are you a revenant ? Because you may be blind :) 
---
If the interview is from September, isn't the Roller Beetle the unexpected mount?
---
Welcome to Gw2!!  It really is the friendliest community in gaming.  Even at endgame, the vast majority of people are super nice.  If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!
---
But most of the changes affect pve. So can be dropped any time. By dropping mid season, it messes up people ranking and no wonder nobody plays pvp game mode anymore. It has to be kept alive by bots. It's sad
---
This video reminded me she ate, **Joko the Undying.** Maybe we go on a quest in to Joko's history and find out how he did that, and activate that mechanism in Aurene. 
---
Rip
---
Secret lair of the snowman? I must've missed this. Crap...
---
Charr tank from core game
---
But it’s difficult for them to make armor that won’t clip /s
---
Anti-easy-mode people are the same guys who complain about escort or river of souls.
---
Geez, I wonder why this kind of raid encounters were added, and who is their target audience...
---
There was a pretty neat shoulder piece released as a reward for the Living Story Season 3 episode 'Flashpoint'. I believe it may be called the Houndskin Mantle?  If you are willing to put a few hours into the achievements for the episode it is a nice looking shoulder piece with fur/animal aesthetics that can be used on any race and unlocks for all armor types. 
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
Hey you should probably wait more than 7 hours to steal a post without giving credit, just saying. Funny how this was on my Google News feed and not the original. 
---
Beetle mount is from June.
---
Found it, thanks!
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy\_Houndskin\_Mantle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Houndskin_Mantle)
---
Well reward tracks with stat-selectable gear include the new expansions/seasons gear, that's probably the least pve you'll get for them.
---
[This one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track) and [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert_Reward_Track) come to mind.
---
Hmm , the multi person pump and dump I could believe .
---
Not sure if extremely stupid, bad troll, or simply ignorant.
---
That example was one of a couple they made exclusively to give players that option. 
---
New elite specs means another nightmare to balance. I don't think the next expac will add more, although it's possible, I think they might have realised it's just taking its toll on the balance overall. We might get a new race since it's easier to implement, who knows.
---
Yeah, couldnt have been because he datamines literally the whole patch minutes after it drops.
---
Giant centaur/warsteed mount? It could fill the horse motif without actually being a horse. Would be a good compromise.
---
&gt; Either way, with Mordremoth's power up for grabs, I wouldn't be surprised if Kralk does attempt to mess with our heads at some point.
---
  
---
  Maybe that's it. We're not dead nor Aurene is, but he's in our mind.
---
If this was from September. Wasn't that just before the roller beetle was released meaning they already lived up to this promise?
---
that one and Orbital Strike tripped me right out when i first equipped them.
---
I never minded Trahearn.  Dude was dope.
---
Yeah people saw it and dumped their gems VERY quickly. As soon as I made the post ( I'm not saying BECAUSE of my post , just as a time frame ) it started surging back down , within 2-3 hours it was back at 130
---
&gt; I do think there are some valid points here, and difficulty settings using tech we saw in the LS Ep5 i think is not a bad idea at all. But there is also a valid debate on what kind rewards should be given though through an easy, normal, and hard difficulty, and the replayability of said rewards (can i get these rewards multiple times?).
---
Fractals of the Mist model, where each tier unlocks rewards from previous tiers as well.
---
I would settle with something like this:
---
* **Easy:** One exotic per boss, chance for generic ascended loot, and a single LI for the final boss. Most achievements disabled, unique loot in the vendor disabled as well.
---
* **Normal:** The above plus another exotic per boss, chance for unique ascended loot (minis, raid weapon skins, etc), and a LI for each boss. Most achievements enabled, and unique loot available through the vendor.
---
* **Hard:** The above plus chance for double additional ascended loot, and progression towards rare hard-mode-only unique rewards.
---
Easy mode should be the same as normal mode, but with less insta-wipes. Maybe even add something like fractals' [Mistlock Singularities](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Singularities). Hard mode should be insane, for the 1%, and be good for streaming.
---
Why can't WE be the villains instead for a change, or at least have the choice to be one. That would be different, but I guess people just want to "feel" like heroes even though an actual hero wouldn't need to feel that need as they'd be more preoccupied with actually helping people.
---
A centaur specialized for mounting could fill the horse motif, possibly?
---
We were all on separate servers and wanted to consolidate everyone onto one server.
---
Oh for sure.
---
Majority of the stuff they produce are still fine imo. Even though I personally love StarCraft 1 / diablo 1 and 2 and don't play much of the newer stuff anymore, so I don't really 'like' blizzard even.
---
A whole hell of a lot of decisions are made to just grab more cash though. That is Activision at work. They are basically Grima Wormtongue whispering 'add more microtransactions' into blizzards ear.
---
Cool story. Doesn't change the fact that there are no horses.
---
That's fine. A transmutation charge is far cheaper than a second ascended axe.
---
What happened with the good old *sigh*?
---
A centaur could fill the horse motif. Think a centaur warsteed. 
---
A phasewalk/mistwalk mount maybe. Activate the ability and it takes you to an alternate form of the map, allowing you to move through it for a short time before reappearing.
---
So like a dream world type thing. Activate ability and you get like a grey filter over your screen to show you you're phased. No enemies or anything, so you can move around and when you deactivate the ability or it runs out, you phase back into the normal map.
---
So it would function almost like a stealth mount but not quite. Then they could put hidden things inside the phased area if they had the tech for that
---
W E B B Y M O U N T
---
You literally have more matches played than I have minutes in the game lmao
---
Dwarves came first. Norn are just big dwarves.
---
A warsteed centaur. I am standing by this. It would be the "horse" without actually being one.
---
jeez good luck with that trek 
---
Wow, that’s a long a time! Probably in that whole time you never came across anyone who had the opinion that anet should release more armor skins and less outfits, huh? I guess that would be a pretty UNpopular opinion, huh??? 
---
Me too! If they could make an algorithm to down scale the armor skins it'd be really easy to do the whole backlog of skins.
---
You're the one who is ascerting they don't when your own sources show that they exist *in the world* just not in game. 
---
Do you play this game ?
---
What does the altar of glaust do again?
---
I'm afraid I can't offer up any suggestions for male characters (turns out, none of my medium-armor characters are), but female humanoids have the Krytan jerkin. It's not perfect, what with the bustier, but that short coat is an improvement to be sure. There's also the Aetherblade jerkin for a pretty cute skirt look. I'm still sad that I haven't found a use for that, personally.  
---
... After some looking, males have the Duelist armor (works for females, too) and human males /females have their Scout's armor, too. The other ones that jump out at me are the Perfected Envoy armor and the Glorious armors, which... well, maybe they're more reachable to you.  
---
We DO need more visual options, and it's hard to work with what we've got sometimes, but we're not at a total loss.
---
my dream noble steeds and how they work:
---
- An actual horse - you don't mount up instantly when you press the button, but instead you whistle and your horse comes running towards you. Takes 5-10 seconds to get to you, BUT you can use this mount button in combat.
---
- A shadhavar - dual seated mount; a bit slow, but faster than walking, and the passenger doesn't need to own the mount. good for carrying your noob friends, figuratively and literally
---
- W E B B Y M O U N T
---
Your post probably did help. Don't sell yourself short.
---
I only play males, and I have constantly been on the lookout for an aesthetic I can only find in light armor for my daredevil. I'm kinda going for a monk feel with the staff and all that
---
it's an example demonstrating that anet can make the shoulders separate.  it's just a matter of whether they want to do it
---
ArenaNet hates overhauling and making useful stuff out of old content. One of the game's biggest fatal flaws.
---
&gt; The suggestion of reusing forgotten assets and not having the most brilliantly designed boss is cool but something anet just seems to go against it as a principle.
---
Well, then it's a shitty dumbass principle that is hurting the game.
---
R
---
They don't even need to reuse old content, just spend their artist's time better.
---
We constantly see them "wasting" resources on stuff that will be on screen for just a few minutes. Glint's Lair, Kormir's Library, etc. Hell, look at the last episode, with the whole fight against Kralkatorrik. Just for a 10-20min story mission most players will only play once.
---
Correct. But they're not going to go back and do it for older outfits. If this is in regards to future outfits going forward? I agree with you. 
---
there is still 1 good dragon boye left in the world and we rescued him from shiro many years ago 
---
A sidecharr sidecar!
---
You probably won't find that.
---
Add-ons are not an official thing in GW2. The most we have is a DPS meter that works by parsing combat data and overlays that aren't technically part of the game but interact with an official API.
---
Arenanet comes down hard on any third party app that provides any sort of advantage. Your usage probably wouldn't violate that, but I don't think anyone has really bothered with things like that due to the gray area add-ons exist in.
---
Dear person who ignores all the stuff they add in game. You should pay more attention. Plenty of weapons and armor have been added in game, as well as the gem store. Outfits are gem store only. Full armor sets are now in game only. 
---
Cash grabs were around long before Activision had any real power.
---
See things like: WotLK cut/recycled content (Azjol-Nerub zone, dance studio, and Path of the Titans scrapped, Crystalsong empty, almost no new raid content at launch), WoW microtransactions (20€ sparking pony), SC2 having no chat channels and forcing you to use Facebook (right after purchasing some social media monetization patents), D3 auction house (the loot was rigged so you were encouraged to use money instead), SC2 and D3 story being divided in 3 because "trilogy" (and story being overall garbage anyway), W3 custom maps being killed by a patch right before the SC2 launch, SC1 eSports being killed right before SC2 launch, SC2 active custom maps being forcefully sorted by popularity (killing the SC2 custom maps community before it even started), and bla, bla, bla.
---
Blizzard didn't go bad when they joined Activision.
---
They joined Activision because they had already gone bad.
---
Anet is strict about 3rd party add-ons. 
---
The [general opinion in the official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/18677/do-raids-need-easy-normal-hard-difficulty-mode-merged/p1) follows the same lines too.
---
Asura can mount a Charr or a Norn. Or the otherway around.
---
u/SrGrafo
---
Ascended amulets, rings, and accessories can be obtained easily from winterberries and laurels. If you really want to craft ascended gear, Domain of Istan is a easy/quick way to earn gold. I did a 1 hour and 30 minute run each day and came out with out 75g-82g and bought all my ascended gear over the course of a week. Otherwise, there is not a large enough difference to warrant it. 
---
I hope it's the spider mount.
---
[This will cure your arachnophobia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7H_Or9Nr5I).
---
&gt; They could make accessing the Mount a Side Story thing that only becomes available after either finishing E6 or starting a later episode, but that sounds like an absolute nightmare to code.
---
Am I misunderstanding this or is this the exact thing they did with roller beetle?
---
Love your ideas! As one of the "wannabees", I think having stuff like this implemented would really open up raiding for those who feel a bit intimidated. I did the Secret Lair a couple of times over Wintersday and had fun :)
---
You don't compete with other players for mats ever (loot doesn't work that way in gw2 ).
---
Also players from all servers are usually mixed together, so your server choice doesn't matter for that either.
---
The only thing that your server determines is who you play for on World vs World. So I would recommend looking at wvw as a concept to see if it's something you'd like. If you have any friends that play the game I would recommend joining on their server. If not, your server choice will not impact you in any way. 
---
Runescape has a similar thing. They talk about "hornless unicorns" like they are a mythical beast lol
---
Rather than make it part of the weapon's effect, I think crafting (and account binding) a legendary bow should also unlock a similarly themed quiver back piece skin. If you want it, you can use it, if you don't, you can ignore it, and it avoids the problem of interfering with other back piece skins.
---
can't do that anymore, thanks to the Signet of Inspiration nerf x)
---
It's official. We're getting the Spanish Inquisition.
---
But it's 2019, we should be able to use the year as an argument!
---
I've never played WoW, why was this raid so good? Can you provide some context?
---
The fact that there are Female Norn is enough to disprove that Dwarves are not mini-Norn.
---
Raid question:
---
What’s the minimal DPS you need to get by in raids? I’m far from a pro player, so my DPS is obviously on the lower end. While I’m unsure of exact numbers of my DPS, it’d be nice to have a goal to surpass. 
---
If it helps, I play condition damage firebrand. 
---
We gonna go full Rick and just find a new dimension where we won
---
I've been afraid of an Aurene mount since I realized aurene was using the same rigging as the gryphon. I super hope it's not her. That would feel so disrespectful. 
---
Would be cool if they split the stories Raids were going down. Start a collection of related wings like 1-3 that are part of the larger story which can be the "real" raids, while following on the W6 story and have the escaped Qadim create a wing of weird monsters to fight. You could even work with Zommoros as the "easy mote" 
---
I seriously doubt they'll undercut episode 5 by making any part of it an illusion. That would be mildly insulting to the audience at best, and at worst call into question their writing if they're willing to inject a dramatic cliffhanger and then call it a ruse immediately after.
---
I have a different theory.
---
The secret Glint told Aurene is that ascending is how your magic "becomes unbound" (to quote Joko's dialogue). And that not only her, but also Joko have left their bodies behind and gone somewhere else, or they've become something else.
---
Joko's secret statue dialogue seems way too thorough and is in way too hidden an area to be meaningless IMO. His recording suggested that he knew the origins of the universe, and that he knew his body was going to die in the moon fortress. There's too strong a parallel between Aurene and Joko, about death and visions of the future to be a coincidence. They both knew something about how the world works that we don't know yet, and I think season 5 is going to build on our realization of what they've both done.
---
I decided to test the waters since I wasn't sure myself. It seems to be going over fairly well, at least for me. And especially considering that the GW2 section on AO3 barely has over 400 works, which for a game that's about 6 1/2 years old, absolutely surprises me.
---
If you do write it, I'd be eager to read it. I'm flattered that this inspired you to want to write your own piece.
---
World vs World (WvW in short) is large scale PvP, where three servers (So techincally its WorldvsWorldsvWorld) compete for land and kills in big maps. So if 100+ man PvP fights sound appealing to you, WvW might be something for you. Some servers are better represtented in WvW than others are, so if you want to join a really busy server that is something to look out for. I might be able to look at the WvW Tier lists and tell you more if you tell me if you are on NA or EU.
---
Skritt Horse pls 
---
Now I'll add Skirbblr posts to my watch list on gw2 reddit
---
Yea that definitely sounds fun to me, I'm on NA.

Ooo, thank you! c:

A chronomancer who placed their continuum rift 2 months ago?
---
You also should consider that fact that if they do make easier raids which pull more people into the content they can then justify spending more time/resources on it. If more than 10% of the playerbase participates in raids its likely that we will see more of them made since you can then justify spending those resources. I also don't think that anyone will be made 'complacent' by an easymode (so long as rewards properly scale.) The people who'd only ever do easy raids are the ones who already don't raid or do so very casually. Most people like myself and I imagine you raid for the fun of it, for the challenge of certain encounters. We'll all still be doing hard raids if they put out easy/training modes. I do agree reward scaling is a very important and tricky thing here tho. Possibly have the easymode raids not drop the unique skins/ascended pieces.
---
Some silent story mission would be great for the mood. No one talking, we just go somewhere and do stuff.
---
I am expecting deep sea dragon to be the last dragon after kralk with a solution to put the others to sleep again and stop the destruction wrought by killing them.
---
I wager we end up defeating kralk by season 5's end or in the expansion, the expansion will either be about bubbles and cantha or he will move into action by season 6 and we start dealing with it then.
---
We may get another expansion past the the next one, but I am not really sure how well it will be doing by then (assuming another 3-4 years from now). And budget matters hugely when considerin how to handle three elder dragons. 
---
Hey, who knows, maybe we get primordus and jormag next expansion and S5 we deal with kralk for the first half and their awakening for the last half ala S4. 
---
also Taco and soon Blish HUD
---
The thing about the chosen one trope is that you either love or your hate it.  Some people get more enjoyment out of being the chosen one that saved the galaxy from an intergalactic empire.  Other people get more enjoyment out of being a humble farmer that “helped out behind the scenes”.  
---
Personally I get more enjoyment out of being the chosen one.  I absolutely hate it in life when people get all the credit for work you have done (big problem in the tech industry).  Whenever I’ve played an RPG where you are the “behind the scenes” person, another NPC generally gets all the credit for the work you have done, even when the NPC wasn’t physically present for the final battle.  Basically it’s like “thank you for saving the galaxy now go away”.  
---
As a side note, the GW2 devs basically retconned the hero of GW Nightfall from being the chosen one to a “behind the scenes” person.  In GW2, Kormir is often referred to as the person who orchestrated the rebellion that ultimately defeated Varesh Ossa and Abaddon.  From what I remember in Guild Wars Nightfall, the player character was the one that single handily orchestrated the rebellion that ultimately defeated Varesh Ossa and Abaddon.  In fact Kormir was presumed dead for most of the game and didn’t make an appearance until near the end of the game.  Heck the NPCs in GW2 don’t even recall the name/gender of GW Nightfall hero.  Talk about revisionist history lol.  
---
Spider mount that uses endurance while it climbs walls?
---
I'd be up for that!  One of the things I excelled at was terrifying my friends in Aliens vs Predator by dropping my alien off unexpected roofing onto their faces. Made one of them physically jump out of their chair once :)
---
The nerf to female human meta we need, but don't deserve.
---
Truth be told, in wvw (unlike pvp) u can abuse the PvE gearing system creating totally broken builds, One perfect example are thievess and especially mirages running double energy sigil + endurance regen food making u almost unkillable,  creating an advantage. The same happens with ascended gear and wvw infusions. U basically stack small "advantages" and suddenly have a big big advantage against players who run with cheap gear AKA exotic.
---
When running in zergs, classes, communication and coordination (and numbers) will always be better than the small boost ascended stats give. 
---
In solo or smaller groups though (havok/roaming) having that edge is extremely important as u often need to fight outnumbered hence that small boost could mean a kill that normally wouldnt happen or surviving a burst that would normally kill you.An advantage is an advantage no matter small or big.
---
The question isnt if is okay to run exotics or not but if u really care enough to invest your gold into more expensive gear.
---
10/10 would want to ride a mordrem
---
We all live in a yellow sub-aurene ...
---
Came across this today. I thought I was in for a stupid fight on a precarious cliff but it just stayed dead (thank the five)
---
Karka Mount when?
---
It's Jason Momoa isn't it?
---
Every time you mount: "COMMANDER!!"
---
They would have to make a really good story to justify Aurene coming back imo. Even if it was some climax, but it ruins any other death Anet ever does.
---
I don't think the rewards are as bad as people make them out to be, but I hate the chart you're using because if you want the player base to come back to the game-mode, you need to prove it's profitable *without* using exploits like merged paths. 
---
Also, most people aren't going to be able to do a tour like that in an hour with pugs, especially if CoE or CoF lock.
---
So I don't doubt the profitability of dungeons if you merge paths and have a static willing to run them. I doubt the profitability of dungeons without merging and with pugs. 
---
That's where the Forgitten purged Glaust of Kralk's corruption making her Glint. An Asuran (forgot the name) found it in Orr and was able to purge a Risen Chicken of Zhaitan's corruption in the Personal Story
---
There's the Dragonsblood and Heroic Dragonsblood sets, Pharos, the mace and shield you can loot from doing events, and armor-wise the Corsair's leggings. 
---
Don't get why you're complaining.

Oh no, I feel like we'll get some hate for sure, I hope we do. It's only fair. But you're right, if anyone has reason to hate us, it's Caithe. I really hope she isn't, but it is deserved. I'm in the same boat. I'll listen, and I hope our characters will work it out with her, but I'll be suffering the whole time. DX
---
We also don't know who else might have died during the fight. Oof, the next chapter is going to crush my soul. Not as much as this one has, but still.
---
For warrior..
---
Start with power bannerslave (str/tactics/disc), it's very easy to find the guide on metabattle or snowcrows. Ideally your precision is around 2100 to cap (someone can correct me if that's wrong), then go with power and ferocity to increase your damage. This build is very good open world pve burst, good for breaking CC bars, and you don't need to change anything for fractals and some raids. Limitation is needing a/a + m/m so youll need to melee.
---
The other banner metas have uses but are more specific (condi banner for raids)
---
What to do with bags opened with lvl 53 toon in Silverwastes?  Sell contents, or sell what is salvaged from the contents?
---
Okay, Dome Chak &gt; normal Karka. You convinced me. Would remind me of artillery so much. Artillery Chak. Slow moving, with a 5000 range attack. Hm...
---
The idea of stand alone raid bosses is really cool, and it can be easy to implement lore wise - Shit is constantly going wrong in this world, and we've got a fucking DRAGON in the Mists. Who knows what's gonna be piling out of those portals. 
---
Actually Cantha invading isn’t out of the realm of possibility with the whole Ministry of Purity/kicking out non-human thing. With how that group acted in gw1 they aren’t the nicest people.
---
It depends on your skill level and play style. If you're zerging, then you won't notice much difference. However, if you're engaging in several-minute-long duels, or taking small outnumbered fights, then it's absolutely worth the upgrade.
---
Keep in mind that it may only be a small stat boost, but those stats often multiply each other (think marauder or zerker gear), so you end up benefiting much more than it first seems. 
---
OMG... Plz I need this
---
That will surely be fixed soon. Did you report the bug ingame or in the forums?
---
Yup, I was specifically thinking of those when I said overlays.
---
If Caithe starts blaming us and saying things, I'mma cry. I love Caithe and her character development means a lot to me on a personal level. I wanted so much for her to succeed and find a place of belonging. 
---
Also I'll be upset if Rox or Almorra didn't make it. I love my Charr and I'm a staunch supporter of the Vigil and their code. Eir COMPLETELY wrecked me in HoT (something I've never forgiven Anet for) because she was one of my favorites. ~~Basically I love all of Destiny's Edge except Logan lol~~
---
(As a side note I *kinda sorta* ship Caithe with the Commander... they have history! Doubly so if the Commander is Sylvari. I like the idea of two strong, queer women raising this awesome dragon baby like some sort of adoptive family. And yes this strongly implies my Commander is queer, because she is)
---
I imagine a debuff on the Commander during the next episode. "Soul Crush: completely break down at random intervals (10s cooldown)"
---
Yes the video you talk about went live in september, but i'm pretty sure it was recorded wayyyy before, pretty sure he talked about the beetle

Salvage, then sell mats

You can get ascended  and even sort of legendary gear with the stats from the expansions (if you own them) through both PvP and WvW. I guess PvP would be more easy since WvW require some grind of rewardtracks and some ranks that can take a while to aquire. 
---
There is a legendary backpack in WvW which also demands ranks and in PvP which don't require any ranks. Ascended backpacks you can get from the season maps for mapcurrencie and i guess it is about what map you like to grind. The Bitterfrost Frontier is probably the more easy one to grind since you gather the currencie and get unbound magic at the same time if you use the gathering tools for that. But you can also use the rewardtrack for mapcurrencie. That will take longer though but all about what you want to do to get it. 
---
I my self usually use the backpacks from Sirens landing because i have tons of karma and add some currencies from the rewardtrack if i feel i need another backpack. This backpacks do not require and unbound magic and why it suits me better. The unbound magic i grind do more or less all come from gathering tools and you gather synts in WvW and i also gather outside of WvW so i have enough of that too.
---
Well that is one way of doing it but i guess there are other ways too that other people use.
---
i' m certain next episode will deal with the fallout and grief of this episode but what got suggested was just a poorly thought out version of that
---
What's the point of having a gap at all? All the gap means is that there's a gap where we can't earn full rewards for playing PvP.
---
No it doesn't. First of all, that wouldn't even be the first resurrection in the game much less in the series. Bar the PC and that one guy from the Flame Citadel every other death has been of minor secondary characters. Aurene isn't secondary. At this point she was deuteragonist. Much more important than most of Dragon's Watch.
---
That's a tiny cat
---
They are connected in so much as there is the ability to switch seats without un-mounting it first.
---
That's why we have awakened sylvari.
---

---
Just do tier 1 one by one. 2avg players can carry on this tier.
---
how can reddit drama be better than ERPing in salma district?
---

---
All of these seem unrealistic.
---
I feel this in my soul.
---
Anet have spent so much time developing Aurene's character, we as players have spent so much to raise her and protect her for her to just die like this. It will take a long time to fully develop a new dragon entity properly to not feel like it's just another Deus ex machina. I am willing to bet she will come back in some way, shape or form 
---
Frankly, it isn't hard right now for ANet to make PoF maps replayable.
---
All they need to do is give 25 trade contract as a reward to heart vendors,  give mosiac elegy to all bounties, nerf Vabbi meta to be a little easier, and finally give the Realm of Torment meta a actual timer.
---
All the living story maps are extremely replayable, yet they only half-way copy the design for it into the PoF maps. 
---
What would be the best necro build towards open world content? I see a lot on metabattle but not sure which one would be great. I want to be able to solo things, if possible :D 
---
So wholesome 
---
There's a difference between optimized and exploits. Silverwastes doesn't have you map breaking to hit chests before they spawn. Istan doesn't have you glitching bosses to get multiple rewards from one encounter. Daily fractals don't have you combining multiple paths into one.
---
So I get that you're responding mostly to my pug comment, but the elephant in the room is exploits, not pugs.
---
The main problem for gw1 to gw2 is that they don't have a specific character they can use as the gw1 player character.. so using kormir is the easiest option. I think maybe they'll be able to use "the first commander of the pact" for gw2 references
---
Only criticism is that you kind of lose the "Trailer" part of it by showing the ending and final words... Really good summary of the story building up + episode though!
---
What about a legendary mount that absorbs the power of all the ones you already own so if you have fully unlocked all of them you can jump fly skim etc without needing to swap 
---
That would be amazing. I would love a spider mount that could run up and down and sideways across walls and ceilings as if it were on the ground, web sling across gaps, and drop down and land on all fours at will. Hahaha that would be so fun. 
---
However, it might traumatize the fuck out of people with arachnophobia. 
---
spoilers!
---
It wouldn't be easy to rewrite the entire story to make place for dwarves. They would need new leveling areas or totally change all other areas. Additionally most of them are dead in gw2 lore so it wouldn't make sense seeing tons of them running arround. 
---
if a charr or a norn mount an asura, it would be like a flesh light.
---
If you have the extra **$** why not spend it on your **fav** timekiller?
---
Primordus focused expansion - maps dealing with battling him include the fire island chain and sea of sorrows, while the rest of the Deldrimor front is given as dwarven leveling space after they return above ground to help us take down the dragon.

I got a headache fighting that thing. Never again.....

thinking its gonna be caithe who dies...her story arc has been done for a while and i feel anet doesnt know what to do with her, why not give her a grand ol send off. her characters been trying to redeem herself since heart of thorns.
---
I did dig deeper in the whole phone camera screen shots thing. Turns out most of the abusers, use reddit app exclusively on the phone. And have no decency to cloud their gw2 screenshots folder.
---
they are releasing a lot of normal armors since PoF, you normally don't notice them that quick because they aren't on the frontpage of the gemshop
---
If my ISP connect drops from 5G to 2.4, GW2 lockup or crash is soon thereafter.
---
They can scale a norn to be a dwarf but can’t scale armor to fit a norn. Hmmm...

Your point about Rox is awesome. I live that idea.

There's open world section on metabattle. Reaper is practically definition of build for soloing, everything else is based on preferences. Pets are usually the easiest choice.
---
Dude imagine us hearing voices or seeing apparitions in the next episode and it’s Caithe and our friends trying to contact us. I’d LOVE that. My only question is how will they incorporate a new map?
---
Ah, season recap was probably a much better description for it than trailer. And I'm really glad to hear you and your friend enjoyed it!
---
I actually couldn’t tell we broke an eye. I just read here that we did and was like oh.
---
Yeah it's going to be interesting to see if the whole resurrection thing comes up in the future.
---
Still make your video! It's not too late for that at all. 
---
I'd defiantly agree it was a bit messy, but I like the suggestion for it - thank you!
---
[Here's the post from one of the devs last year, giving some details on the design.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72qdic/hidden_mounts_ability_is_definitely_not_a_glider/dnlfzfe/) You can get a little higher than you started, but it's limited. I didn't mean to imply that you can't gain height, just that the amount of height you can gain is related to where you started ("Not every ascension..." means some will get you higher, i.e. your first few). When I said it's based on your initial position, I meant it's your initial position plus some height they coded in. If you're able to ascend to an arbitrary height, regardless of starting point, then it's either a bug or they changed the behavior. I'm betting on bug because I'm not able to replicate an infinite climb.
---
Also, [Astralarium pokes above the cloud line to begin with.](https://imgur.com/OeyYOuK) So if you're starting there, you're already close to the cloud line.
---
Thank you :)
---
Just needed for WvW and RP servers.
---
WvW is in the process of getting a big makeover, from Server vs Server to Guild Alliance vs Guild Alliance. I’m hoping ANet will carry that over to PvE as well and get rid of servers altogether and rebase the game on guilds and guild alliances. Players in the same guild or alliance will be put on the same shard together.   
---
Yeah Trailer was probably a poor description of what it was!
---
100% condi duration = double amount of damage you get per condition applied (over double duration of course). It's a lot more worth than a few hundreds of condi damage (in pve).
---
Toughness is irrelevant if you don't get hit and the whole point of mirage is doing damage while avoiding damage. Power may be irrelevant in longer fights, but there's some skills that have good scaling, making weaker mobs die instantly instead of after few seconds. However, you can never have too much damage in pve, defensive stats can be quite useless though. 
---
Only one dye channel, though. 
---
What would power reaper dps be using blood magic instead of soul reaping? I've always used blood magic and don't want to switch just for more dps
---
Snowcrows has it at 29k for power reaper with soul reaping, how much Lowe is it with blood magic?
---
Positioning with mirage takes some practice. Don't worry mirage is good for most of the game.  
---
Viper is the standard for most condi builds. Building up them condis takes some time so having them last longer is always good.  
---
Make sure your runes and sigils are also correct! A big part of your build relies on them.  
---
Regarding the chaos line - currently the meta is illus/duelling for mirage, so there's that.  
---
A daredevil requires practice to get it to be survivable. But a well played Daredevil is unkillable. Crit heal is definetly sustainable, with proper gear you can get a pretty high crit chance. Tho if you have positioning issues with mirage switching to daredevil won't solve it - you'll be dodging a lot on daredevil and you dodge much further than normal dodge. You'll have the same issues just with different animations.  
---
Basically - i think you mostly need to get properly geared and practice. Go into HoT and solo every champ you see that'll teach ya.
---
What is this? The new tooltip that shows how many of a thing is in your bank seems to be counting that as a normal potato.
---
Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Commanders use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, S. Tuberosum, know the true power of the potato. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the potato called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the potato. Behold the Commanders, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the potato. Let it be known, if the Commanders want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Commanders are lost, and they will resist. But I, S. Tuberosum, will cleanse this place of their impurity.
---
That's why I don't have any incentive to log in. The story overuses the same plot device - make us like a character, then have something terrible happen to them in a desperate attempt to rip an emotional reaction out of us. It can't be all flowers and rainbows but it's getting so repetitive and predictable that I just can't take it seriously anymore.
---
[Here it is in a build editor](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs+cnsIClfi9pBGoBUrhlVjqeZj2ptcDGhA48HSiiA-jxRBQBA4EAcQ1fMjSQis/wVU+NxHCAe0LEA4A48mHzDO/8zP/8zr5nf+5nf+5nf+5BA-e) if anyone can’t see the vid (text was blurry for me). Just replace the Commander armor with Diviner armor (calc doesn’t have Diviner’s yet), weapons and trinkets are Berserkers.
---
There's a better way to fix that problem; Allow the players to make their own outfits.  Allow the players to utilize the transmute system to set skins to always overwrite current equipment.  Separate skins from the item in a way.
---
Have a nice day :)

&gt;Type 2 Ability: Multi-person

Purpose: Transportation and traversing large areas carrying from 1-4 extra people. We’ll be trying to make it so a 5 person mount is a thing(yup crazy) as we see a lot of benefit to carrying a whole party. Easier to travel as a group with friends between events, locations, etc and help promote more social interactions between players.

In my guild the rule ended up being : we teach you as soon as you have full ascended trinkets and exo armor/weapon with the proper stats, and prove you are at least working on your rotation. Its not a huge time investment, but there's still one. 
---
In the end, people putting in the effort learned much faster, were more willing to take advice, and stayed in the guild for a very long time. As opposed to the times we'd teach anyone and ended up with 4 out of 5 trainees just quitting after getting their free AP from getting carried. 
---
It's hard to say how much dps loss will occur, since no one is really going to take their time benchmarking a suboptimal build. 
---
For open-world it doesn't matter whether you take Bloodmagic or Soulreaping. You lose quite a few raw offensive stats by not taking Soulreaping and thus your burst will be weaker (albeit sufficient for pen world). 
---
For instanced group-content (raids, fractals): People already don't take Reapers seriously, even if they play an optimal build, since the spec itself isnt consideredoptimal. You might find people having a problem with your build.
---
Oh wow, I didn't know that, that actually looks pretty cool!
---
because jokos magic might be what revives her...but it needs the life force of something else to power it, something connected to her.
---
only beings connected to aurene are caithe, and the commander...arguably more so caithe since she literally branded caithe.
---
I don’t think I lack perspective - in fact one of my main points is that I understand the perspective of those who don’t want to wipe or even get ten people. I suggested that some raids could be unfailable and soloable lol.
---
You mean *Lobster's Arch* ?
---
I had that exact feeling when we were fighting against Caudecus. Since release, his storyline was interesting to me. But Arena Net went the standard "dude is just evil and wants to rule everything" route... What killed my expectation that they can pull off an believable villain that is not an over the top ED or god. And I was proven right with the Palawa Joko story.
---
Scarlet was not that bad. I think the LW1 format was just really awkward with introducing new characters. It took Scarlet way too long to actually do something. Everyone was already annoyed by that point.
---
Yeah, I'm playing the Minion build. With berseker gear I am still dependant on minions to take the damage for me, but the shroud second hp bar helps. I only got in trouble once when the burst was so high it are through both bars haha. I played with scourge a bit, the only things I disliked was that it seemed he is limited to the shades area - meaning he can't deal easily with high mobility enemies - and that there's no fancy animations like with reaper :D
---
Tbh, both are beaten by my mirage mesmer who can't get hit and has similar dmg (albeit not bursty like reaper)
---
Well Yeah, That was a weird experience.. It went from pirate town to Atlantis..
---
Make people forget about the same top 10 win traders that have been there for the last 6 seasons. 
---
But there is currently not enough underwater content. You have a couple of maps south of LA and in Orr where it would make sense. But other than that? The final map of this season would need to be at least 80% deep water for an underwater mount to make sense. And as long as we don't swim to Cantha, I really don't know where this map is supposed to be located.
---
My wholly subjective opinion:
---
**Central Tyria**
---
* Pact Commander: worth going to the end as the last one has auto-loot, which is a massive convenience boost.
---
* Legendary Crafting: Due to resources needed to craft legendaries, I would put this as the lowest priority. You can still collect materials for them. If you really want to, unlock the first one then swap back to something else until you're ready to unlock the next step. 
---
* Fractal Attunement: Definitely unlock Follows Advice if you want to do fractals. Daily rewards and access to the vendors is very worthwhile.
---
**Heart of Thorns**
---
*Bare minimum needed* 
---
* Gliding: Ley Line Gliding is needed in some raids, so if you want to raid you will need to unlock this eventually. You need to unlock Updraft Use to continue the story. 
---
* Itzel Lore: Bouncing Mushrooms is needed to continue the story. Vendor (language) one is useful.
---
* Exalted Lore: Exalted Markings is needed to continue the story. Vendor (assistance) one is useful. 
---
* Nuhoch Lore: Nuhoch Hunting is needed to continue the story. Vendor (language) one is useful. 
---
There are also achievements and collections that need some to progress. For the elite spec weapons: Exalted Gathering, Nuhoch Stealth Detection, Stealth Gliding. 
---
**Path of Fire**
---
Less to say here as they are all related to mounts and the game is very good at telling you what you'll need next. Adroit Evasion (Jackal 4) is useful for getting around unmolested, though.
---
**Dungeons and Raids**
---
Dungeons are instanced story content. Many people do them as they're levelling.
---
Fractals are a special kind of dungeon that is more like the Dungeon Finder in WoW. They get harder as they go up tiers. 
---
Raids are raids are raids. Look for a training guild (you can join up to five guilds). The LFG can be unfriendly to newbies. 
---
i want this soo bad...my fave parts of path of fires story were when it was just the commander...
---
i wont mind being alone and getting some revelations next episode.
---
it does happen rarely but i do appreciate when anet attempts to develop the commander a little.
---
It is generally expected of every DPS player to pull their own weight in order for the Group-DPS to be high enough to get clean kills. What that means in numbers depends on the group you are in and the encounter itself, as well as the class you are playing. 
---
In general, I would say you should measure your performance based on the other player's performance in your group. As a Firebrand, you are a DPS player first and foremost. As such, try to have higher DPS than all of the Support specs, including Banner-Warrior specs. Having lower Damage than any of the Support specs is gerenally a sign that something is going wrong on your end. Keep in mind though, having to deal with mechanics will negatively impact you DPS heavily, so take the actual numbers with a grain of salt and think about what you could have been doing better. 
---
You stab spears into both his eyes and use them as handles.

Obviously charr roller.
---
PS tempest
---
god I want that mount, and then I want a raid wing that actually uses mounts.  
---
empty atlantis 
---
i miss zerker warrior dps
---
Can you expand on that?  I really don't see an exploit or cancerous effect from it.  What are the main negatives you see?
---
God do I wish there was a way to replay that somehow. It was amazing and Epic.
---
Well, I dunno. The events from the 3 wings of Forsaken Thicket are essentially a prequel to Living World season 3. And Bastion of the Penitent reintroduced Eye of Janthir, which would become relevant at the ending of Season 3. Hall of Chains events are happening in no small part due to Grenth's absence (and the actual fate of the Gods and reasoning behind their decision was a story point in PoF). The only raid actually non-relevant to the overarching storyline is now Mythwright Gambit (and even here some points may be made against this notion).
---
A seahorse mount and collaboration with Aquaman movie
---
WvW is still unbalanced but Anet is working on a new alliance system that has potential to fix things. Hopefully sooner rather than later because that gamemode is bleeding players.
---
You're right.. I'm awful, only a monster would say the things i've said.. Please forgive me, I'll fly away now and never come back.  Oh wait..
---
I also had a problem with the Caudecus fight that stopped progress on the first try. Once I finished the fight in the library, the dialogue after the cutscene of him escaping and shooting Demmi didn’t play and I couldn’t use the portal. At all. It was there, it even had the interact option, but I couldn’t actually use it at all. Guess who had to start ALL OVER AGAIN. Definitely my least favorite part of LWS3, hands-down.
---
It took me a while to make my first charr since I didnt like their face in hair from the defaults. Finally bit the bullet after getting a total makeover kit with path of fire. Holy shit has it been a struggle. I spent a few gold just to get a shirt I could wear while leveling her that didnt have the tail clipping. Avoiding that tail clipping is hell. But at least a lot of medium armor still looks decent... I looked through my wardrobe of light armor out of curiosity and immediately felt relieved I didnt go mesmer for her like I was originally going to.
---
Woo riding choya on piggyback!
---
Maybe that's the idea of the gap - to give us time to try out the other gamemodes.
---
It's ironic how this picture is also a potato.
---
i'm afraid of bears.
---
Spider Mount with "no spidrs plz" toggle and "no bearz too plz" in the options that replaces them with snakes. :D
---
because they are not in the shop. there have been only single armor parts in the shop, but not many.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

I dunno, it's a pretty big table. Maybe pushed nearer to the corners?
---
The Mists are not part of Tyria.
---
Wrecking and rebuilding Lion’s Arch was great fun, and totally felt like *hey, we really we did stuff!*
---
I feel like we need to return to the Living World content that actually changes the core maps... Having everything happen so far away feels like the effect is lessened somewhat. 
---
Kralky is a great candidate for this! Like, why stop at the Crystal Desert? Let him take a happy lil jaunt across the Shiverpeaks, let him purple-nuke a few things. Let’s take him down on home turf! \o/
---
Another another another one after Glint/Vlast/Aurene?
---
That's excessive. 
---
yeees. My asura have always wanted to mount a golem 
---
2008 called; they want their hackneyed opinion back. WoW has been an Activision-associated product for over 2/3rds of its lifespan. Can't we all just admit that after nearly fifteen years, it's just getting old?
---
 Hey, old player returning to the game. Was wondering how are the classes these days when it comes to pve? Is revenant and necro irrelevant? Thanks in advance!
---
Volatile magic gathering tools are on sale
---
Only 2800 gems
---
I think some people are scared of snakes too, hmm. . . I guess there could be an emergency fallback that replaces them all with "social situations." 
---
Well the big plottwist on Lazarus being Balthazar was "Dude got a mirror of Lyssa. From where? We don't know... Just deal with it!"
---
Maybe Kralk has Lyssas hairbrush and is now the elder god of crystal and lies? Just joking of course...
---
But still, his magic is close to what I would assume Lyssa could also do. Not the tearing part reality. More the summoning of chaos storms. And last episode mentioned the "we need to shatter Kralk" part way too often. Yes, I still hope that Lyssa is somehow involved in more things as we think. Not necessarily involved in Kralks powers but something is going on with her. (Or it is just me not wanting Arena Net to drop the only interesting plot for my favorite god.)
---
After doing many and more pugging I realized the problem with pugs and their take on raids is that EVERYONE is trying to copy SC and their strategy (for example No-Updrafts on Gorseval) even tho they don't have the required DPS to that kind of strategy.
---
&gt;The idea of an underwater focused expansion, or even LW map, makes me a bit nervous. Even tho GW2 has one of the best underwater systems in the industry, but gamers usually tend to hate this kind of content. I for sure would not like a map that is mostly underwater.
---
One idea I've had is to 50/50 on the underwater aspect by mixing it with the Depths of Tyria. So the expansion would be a mix of deep-sea floor and underground tunnels/caverns kept from flooding by magic or some other contrivance. 
---
&gt;I think the best bet we can make on a new mount, would be something that can traverse vertical terrains. Not sure if this is possible in the GW2 game engine, but something that can walk on walls or ceilings would be interesting. 
---
I'm sure it would be possible, but tricky and likely nausea-inducing. If you've played Portal 2, Valve originally had a purple gel in development that would allow players to stick to walls, but was cut for precisely that reason.
---
&gt;Arena Net has a track record on abandoning features that are even related to our current content. The new map has no sandportals for example. Most of the HoT and LW3 masteries are completely useless in 90% of the world. So the new mount would need to fit universally in most of the content without too much adjustments.
---
I don't think it's quite fair to say that they abandon those mechanics at all, rather that because of the nature of the game's content distribution and sectioning, it's entirely possible for them to have a scenario where a player might buy PoF but not HoT. So they can't really utilise HoT features as a result. The new map isn't exactly thematically fitting for *sand* portals either.
---
fuck you
---
my personal onion: petey the beetle is one of those rare insects with two adult (sexually mature) life stages. his second form is that of a flying insect. petey canonically is a  mutant scarab and we has seen plenty of scarabs flying throughout pof /takes off tinfoil hat
---
Just like the Jackal sand portals, the next mounts could have mechanics that can only be used at specific locations.
---
Ah that is what you mean. Like those shoes and gloves. Yeah, just a whole set would be nice. :)
---
Bearing in mind some of them look rather grizzly by default.
---
Returning players (stopped pre HOT) want to know what's the best way to play the game now. Some background: two other friends and I got our hands on some free HOT and since I played before, we want to play the game together again. I got a few thousand golds, two lvl. 80 characters and loads of xp scrolls (enough to level three of us to 80 I think). But we are busy people (less than 5 hours play time a week) and I have not played the game for many years (seriously overwhelmed when rejoined) so I want to ask for any advice on how to best enjoy the game now. I suspect we will play mainly PvE since we can do that at our own pace better than PvP. The two other players know nothing about the game. I used to enjoy (pre-fractal) dungeons a lot before I stopped but things might have changed.
---
Understand that there is no objective "best way" but appreciate all ideas nonetheless. Thanks in advance!
---
A chariot pulled by 3 norn in bear form.

Gigantic if factual
---
Please spoil me I can’t play until April 😣
---
Personally I think you tied it back quite well and this is one of the more plausible theories that people are suggesting to resolve LS4. I hadn't considered the process of getting The Ascension and was quite sceptical on your points at first but the Hymn of Battle and the very deliberate choice of choral music motifs, used for the first time apparently, won me over.
---
I just hope the next episode is good because All or Nothing felt like a bit of a let down sadly. 
---
They did change the swoop at one point, it is less responsive than it used to be.
---
Hey man just wanted to drop in and say I appreciate the effort on the post!  One thing to keep in mind which is a very common thing I see when theory crafting posts with a "35k" DPS average is that some classes just *really* excel in some encounters.
---
Like losing DPS spot on lets say a fight like Gorseval might matter a tad less than losing a DPS slot on SH where Mirage can go absolutely mad. Or for instance a DH can completely destroy split phases on VG. I do enjoy the constructive thinking and I think you'll be happy with the Reddit post for FB/Ren stuff you'll be seeing soon :)  
---
Also horses mentioned in the novels. Just because we haven't seen one in game, doesn't mean they don't exist
---
Nah, I don't think it's about lore excuses, more like their decision to keep bounties tied only to PoF-Elonian maps. There's a chance they won't bring bounties for the next season, or at least won't bring them on regular basis anymore. Questions about how good or bad it is are for another topic though.
---
I thought about way two as well, so I'm trying on shields at the bank. Apparently shields always replace your batwings backpack, so it doesn't matter which one you pick.
---
That's a shame 😢
---
On first glance it looks just like her!
---
It needs more housing, more street life and more dialogue. That oversized plaza feels inappropriate, like a massive blind spot in that city, or a void that everyone tries to forget about. I bet you can percieve the curvature of Tyria on that plaza.
---
Only point of critic is that you might have wanted to streamline the aspect ratio through out the footage
---
. Normal game play and trailers are in 16:9 (normal style) and cutscene Ik game are in a wider fashion (16:10?) with the black bars at the bottom and top. 
---
Why would you use reddit on your phone &gt; on your PC?

Do these ppl also post on official forums?

r/unexpectedwarframe
---
Yeah we are EU, we play on Ruins of Surmia realm
---
I'm still annoyed they dropped the spider mount. 
---
A multi seat mount would be amazing. Being able to run my alt account around and do double world map sans renown hearts would be bae. 
---
That would make this message annoying and insta-delete-worthy.
---
It's up to you if you ever want to make someone else smile and send it to them or not.
---
Every time I see a "chain" message my first instict is it delete it and block person who send it : P
---
We do have both of the expansions, I must've forgotten to mention. I didn't know that HoT was before though I think we might jump onto that, we only did the story for that up to the point of the gliders 
---
Thanks, I think I did very well as well, at least according to the amount of downvotes.
---
Underwater mount + final LS4 mastery ability to autoswitch mounts per environment.

Mystic for : exotic

How would weekly 'force' you to do anything? You can just skip it if you don't want to do it.

Although I'd hate the quest marker to pop up - 'Have existential crisis' or 'wander around a bit' haha

Wait...
---
That would be awesome!
---
A rebound Dragon will only help in the short term! hehe
---
Thanks. I just got a Black Lion salvage kit yesterday and was wondering what to use it with. Now I know!
---
i dont get it. do people not have self control?
---
I'm almost done with the Holo Ascended Sword! gracious. Just need to kill that bounty and find a caffeinated skritt to kill LOL.
---
Should I run a sword-pistol perhaps?
---
What a nice guide. Thank you.  
---
Now can you make the same guide but with more things going on?  
---
Like... I don't know... Some place full of ads and with your party stacking and you know, actually fighting?  
---
That would be great!  
---
Just to put a closure on this subject, don't be selfish thinking everyone can see as well as you think. And more on that, I am not the only one who finds that birds are hard to spot.
---
flash forward to us holding Grenth in a headlock.
---
Do iiiiiiit.
---
I have a feeling that's an oof towards a certain someone else making comics on the regular here
---
Entire fight with the drunken haze filter? I'm game for that in a major way! And I for sure meant the latter. Either the commander becomes totally despondent, or loses his/her temper big time. Scorched earth! I mean Tyria.
---
Hello!
---
Quick question: What are the the statistical (non-fashion related) pros and cons of Holosmith using Sword-shield versus Sword-Pistol.
---
I really like running with sword+offhand, but I'm not sure whether shield or pistol is best for running story or open-world solo stuff.
---
Pistol on engy is a condi weapon. It also won't change the fact that you will still have shiled :p
---
I get what you mean. I want her back, but if they go down the 'alive' in the mists, with her mother and brother, then that's okay too. Her death will still matter, and she gets to be with her family.
---
On the other hand if the twist is clever enough I'm fine with this being all part of a larger plan.
---
A spot of gold perhaps, whilst the world burns?
---
Perhaps a spot of fishing... xD
---
Accurate except that the offhand sword has a sigil of force, not conc, and remember that commander's is major: power, precision whereas diviner's is major: power, concentration, so some boon duration is missing.
---
Guilty as well b cause I couldn’t care what people think of my posting decisions. That’s what the downvote button is for. 
---
Maybe the old team will help keep the new team together, even if the commander goes awol for a bit.
---
Sometimes I get nervous and get really sweaty hands when I'm trying to reach a small high spot with my Springer xD I still like the feature, but the struggle is real sometimes :D
---
I wouldn't say we're adored us (we managed to skirt around telling everyone to leave the dragons alone), but yeah - I want fully fallen from grace, raging, vengeful commander.
---
Essentially I want a cool, personal version of what Braham went through.
---
Big THONC 
---
Not sure how an alliance system has any impact on skill balance.
---
That's an awesome skin. 
---
Not having much buildup hasn't stopped ANet yet from randomly throw something out. Just look at the Balthazar reveal or the PC trapped in the death realm scene.
---
Neither really had much buildup and we were left to deal with it so while I personally don't agree with Nox's ide, I also wouldn't put it past ANet to throw something similar outthere.
---
&gt; I prefered to create a new to post since it would be easier than searching through all the questions.
---
May the downvotes be with you
---
Actually, this was one of the easier mastery achievements to finish. Not a buttload of 'Story Journal' achievements, which are the ones I dislike.
---
And the mantle looks GOOD on my human and norn characters.
---
What I would personally recommand you to use, is WvW chest armor ([Sublime Mistforged Triumphant Hero's Brigandine](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sublime_Mistforged_Triumphant_Hero%27s_Brigandine).  
---
It has 'backpack like' [effect](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gw2/images/8/8a/Sublime_Mistforged_Triumphant_Hero%27s_Raiment_%28skin%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180604080130&amp;path-prefix=ja) while in combat.   
---
Still doesn't solve your issue, but you can dye those wings and it works more dynamically with how your character looks.
---
Buy them as soon as possible and at the very least do the first story chapter from PoF to unlock the raptor mount - also consider going a little deeper for the springer mount, both are absolute godsends in LS and HoT content
---
Not everyone likes them.
---
&gt;for end game fractals
---
solid as support renegade
---
&gt;and dungeon
---
only if you want to be useless and get carried
---
Is there a utility that uses the API to track which mastery insights/strongboxes/achievements you are missing?
---
Yes please. I'd love to experience the story of raids, but I'm neither a particularly skillful player nor find challenging content fun.
---
GW2 raids are NOT super hard. There allready is noob friendly wing4+some other bosses. What else do you want?
---
IMO you literally want to carry players through the raids. Players which don't want to spend 5min reading dulfy raid guide, players wearing absolutely random gear, not knowing optimal rotations, knowing very little about their prof capabilities.
---
I will repeat - what's the point? It's MMORPG, where in order to achieve something you have to invest some time and effort.
---
Oh, yeah, you need to try daredevil before making judgement on it based on thief. daredevil Staff is the most class-changing weapon out there other than like, maybe Druid staff.
---
Hey.
---
Afaik LS1 isn't replayable
---
LS2 introduce HoT
---
LS3 introduce PoF and add 5 maps (correct me if i'm wrong)
---
And LS4 is running but the you may not have the firsts episodes and unlock some maps as well !
---
If you want to know more about the lore and the story go for it (I did it for the 2 lasts ep of LS2 that I missed). But if you are not that much interested maybe only take the episode in LS4 witch unlock the Beetle...
---
Remember that the packs in the store are cheaper than just 1 epidode from the personal menu

state your region: na/eu
---
&gt; I thought the living stories were included
---
no, anet has to make some money, they are discounted to 0 if you play the game during releases
---
&gt; are they worth it ?
---
well they exist, and many people have purchased and played them, worth is up for you to decide. there is noting to wait for 2 and 3 are on discount in gem store, 4 is ongoing and will take a bunch of months to go on bulk discount.
---
&gt; what do they offer ? 
---
content, story, mount, items, etc...
---
"go to corner and weep" :P 
---
but really i dont think we'll be entirely alone...think caithe will be with us the episode....might even start seeing the pale tree for the first time in...years...caithe would go to her for guidance after all that.
---
If you look at this potato as example ... the answer is obvious 
---
It's most likely gonna be back next wintersday :)
---
It was introduced this Wintersday and was available for 3 weeks.

---
Serious question here, is it me or are the Norn a lot smaller than they were GW1?  I remember Jora towering over everyone the first time I saw her.  In GW2, they seem to just be a foot taller and chunkier.
---
Really depends on what you want to do, I really enjoy the fractal and raid content myself so you could work towards that but since the other two are brand new it might be better to not rush them. If they decide to level normally and not boost to 80 I'd just suggest to not focus on hearts and aim for events and yellow mobs to kill (haven't been killed in a while = more exp). If they are going to boost to 80 they'll need to learn a lot all at once and it can be pretty overwhelming. In the PvP lobby there are practice golems and NPCs and it equips you with whatever stats you want with all skills unlocked so its great to try things out. 
---
Once they have a handle of everything you can try out dungeons (not all that active most of the time) or start learning fractals (they start off very easy and ramp up slowly). 
---
Feel free to ask me any questions and I can help you out with guides or more info.
---
&gt; It's still a condi weapon.
---
it's there only for the stats, and cc anyway. so it's ok
---
Man, I’m so bitter about the invisible shoes. It’s all I’d wear on my charr characters if I had it unlocked. But it’s so rare and expensive. Sad face. 
---
I got 4 symbols of control since the release of that patch and i salvage about 500+ items every day. All others i got about 20-40 of. 
---
Mind though i am not going to pile up my magic find to 600 something every day and imo it should not have to have that either. 
---
But i agree for me symbol of control is the one that is simply way to hard to get.
---
You wont be able to use mounts in non-pof story instances anyway
---
And you wont experience the open world difficulty as it was intended
---
As you are interested in the story, do it chronologically.   If you want to prep for end game faster, get raptor (you can avoid spoilers by turning sound off :D and playing other guy's story in party till raptor part)
---
For the love god. Screen shot button says hi /s
---
Yeah, it's typical experience entering HoT. It requires a little more tryharding, active play, and a couple "Oh Shit" skills always off cool down just in case.
---
 Also exotic gear would help a little, but mostly it requires you to be more attentive, fine tune you build and just work a little harder than in core maps.
---
Isn't it equally ez to take screenies via phone?
---
I think those are gnomes lol 
---
Hey, 
---
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk1ek-SZd0Q) from Deroir made how it actually plays out clear to me.

&gt; 6% !

wvw infusions 
---
I would watch that OVA.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. Nice to have a ball park figure to work with. I’m sure I’m doing more than that already, so I reckon I’m good. I expected the numbers to be a fair bit higher, to be honest. Just need to work on learning all the mechanics, because a dead DPS is zero DPS!
---
It will include a Jason Momoa outfit too
---
they will always be inferior pictures of led display bits, compared to real screenshot

Well I can rewind an electric motor - can you?

What's so hard to grasp about anything?

And here I was feeling good about my 1k-ish with powerful venom sacs.
---
The Norn men definitely show this as their body model is basically that of a dwarf, just made tall.  They most certainly were not in GW1 though.  
---
Also the Norn women don't have beards in either game, so no dwarves there.
---
I've checked, crew is the word is wanted to use. Translation is right for me. :/
---
I got the Haunted Armor Outfit because I thought it was simple and nice, the shoulders weren't too big either BUT they clip horribly during the Sylvari arm swing idle animation. I want to hide the stupid shoudlers. :( Or an option to turn off idle animations, that would solve 90% of my clipping issues, tbh.
---
I full clear every week. I don't know what point you are trying to make. 
---
I want more content for this game mode not less. Gatekeeping is only going to suffocate and kill it and you'll only have yourself to blame. This content needs more players. 
---
I don't know if it was the same for other people, but originally when it was released, Guild Wars 2 was sluggish in the PC I had then. This really affected the enjoyment when compared to now, in retrospect.
---
On plenty of boss, shield if useless for tanking low pressure boss. You just lost cc from shiled 5 but it's not that good since nerf. But of course, it's better to use shield if you need it (better have it than go down =p).  
---
Desmina is a condi boss so not concerned by my post.
---
WvW alliances, the mounts might have respawn timers or others on the mount may have the ability to shoot off of it. 
---
I also have some fps issues with the game. My specs aren't the pc master race lvl (Fx6300  16gb r9 280x win10(drivers up to date)) but i used to have 30-50fps. 
---
So today I launched the game to play the new LS and oh lord. I had 13fps in the Durmand Priory. Also in the story instance had like 20fps. (both at best performance settings). 
---
Used repair tool, run in compatibility mode and now I am re-installing the game. Any fixing suggestion is welcome. :)
---
I expected real life cosplay :^)
---
Thanks a lot for your answers, I'll wait a little bit before buying them, I have a lot to explore for the time being, but I'll definitely be getting them. 
---
There's hardly anything left of Blizzard. Soon it will be nothing but the brand with activision employees. 
---
There is a big story spoiler right before you get your mount. Although if you do want to go through the entire story then you may forget about it by then.
---
I took my time enjoying HoT and season 3 before buying PoF. It sucks at first but you'll quickly get over not having a mount.

Back in 2013-2014 I used to send one Crystalline Dust every day to one of our most enthusiastic WvW commanders. I called the mail "Daily Dust" and had a new dust-related poem for him every day, most of which were self-invented.
---
Made him smile, and something extra to talk about during the more dull moments of WvW commanding. I'm afraid none of this survived the test of time.
---
Mechanics and, since there aren't set rotations, skill priorities which are impacted by procs and momentary changes. WoW also requires a degree of skill with tanking and healing which is completely absent from GW2.
---
WoW does raids far better than GW2 but getting used to the feel of movement and combat in GW2 pretty much ruins other MMOs. 
---
Theres rotations and on top of them resource management. As for the raids yeah mechanics and the existance of the holy trinity. GW2 mechanics are more like WoWs mechanics from 10 years ago. Just google a YouTube video of some recent WoW Mythic raids or something (think the most recent Mythic Uldir world 1st race topped the charts on twitch). If I were to compare I'd place the raids somewhere around WoW Normal tier. (There's 4 tiers, LFR (noob tier), Normal (casual tier), Heroic (slightly less casual tier I guess) and Mythic (big boi tier).  
---
Long story short there's a reason why WoW world first races are very popular and lucrative while most people don't even know GW2 has raids x) Just gotta see for yourself, like I stated above, GW2 can't even come close to making any interesting or challenging mechanics like that because of the way the combat is designed. 
---
a mount for multiple players
---
This, with the mursaat chilling there in GW1 it's not wierd there are some pieces of jade construct either lying around or being used for "research"
---
I think that Caithe will be the key to Aurene's return.
---
This captures my feeling of mesmer perfectly.
---
Love the class but god all that purple! 
---
blizzard 3k employees, anet 400
---
I'd advise on getting Path of Fire cause thats the one you get all the mounts, Heart of Thorns gives your the glider and thats it.
---
Mounts work almost everywhere in open world(except jumping puzzles). In instanced content (dungeons, fractals, story instances pre-PoF...) they will not work.
---
Heart of thorns however has much more active maps to this day, and imo better designed ones as well 
---
Super beautiful. I love it, clearly you're very dedicated about doing art and it pays off! 
---
I wish classes would have (even if in gemstore) animation replacers. Imagine replacing purple and butterflies with grey smoke and reavens. 
---
The ban hammer was never so fast
---
&gt; instances 
---
this means anything to you? if not, when you do the story... you are not in the base game world where your mounts do work, you are in the instance, where you alone and npc-s exist (and up to 4 possible party members in case of story instances, but this is irrelevant) So when you do past story, and the current world is change, instances are still outdated most of the time - so they do not support any mounts or gliders, if those did not exist when instances where created/updated).
---
Condition duration increases how many ticks your dots last for. It doesn't reduce the damage of individual ticks. It's a multiplier to your condition damage, unless the enemy cleanses the condition before it expires, or dies before they expire.
---
As a sylvari main I'm all for it!
---
Yep... never spent a dime on this game since launch (other than buying the game). Then recently I finally caved and used some of the 600 gems I had collected over the years to buy more bag space. 
---
That pretty much opened the flood gates.  
---
I just wanted to echo what everyone else said and follow it with this: it gets easier. 
---
Heart of Thorns is notorious for the pocket raptor welcoming committee and mordrem snipers, but (especially after Verdant Brink) are some of the most popular maps due to the long and rewarding meta events. 
---
Look out in the LFG for HP trains/runs - giant mobs of players working together to unlock hero points. They should be able to help you (and you'll help them).
---
In general Fractals and Raids don't have preferences between those two DPS builds unless one of them is much more efficient than the other, aka is meta (most effective tactic available).  
---
To be more precise, some meta builds are more or less effective depending on the specific raid/fractal you're going to deal with. This is because power builds do great against mobs that have to die quickly/skip to the next phase as do their dps with mostly raw damage, while condi builds do much better in situations where they can stack conditions onto enemies and can keep hurting them even when they're not directly attackable.  
---
Depending on the fractal/raid, some classes are more efficient than others as well even if they share the same stats due to their own mechanics. For example, Power Soulbeast is currently very appreciated in Fractals because you can quickly kill all the trash minions thanks to the high-damage skills you have, while in Raids both dps builds are sometimes a good pick and others not.
---
Currently, the Ranger class and relative specs happen to be good at both power and condi due to their skillset that covers both efficiently. There's also the option of playing Druid in if you want to play support, so they're a very versatile class in general.
---
Base ranger *does* have a condi build, but that's a weaker version of the condi build for the Soulbeast spec, which also covers power much more efficiently to the point of making a power Ranger a poor choice compared to the condi version. That doesn't mean you can't play however you want in most game modes, but you just won't fit in the current meta and people might not want you in their fractal/raid team (which is in their rights, as often non-meta builds in the hands of not-enough-skilled players can ruin the run and waste time).
---
Metabattle offers a good choice of fairly-meta builds for Rangers and specs ([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger)), but if you want to keep using the base Ranger you'll probably have to create your own build after studying the others.
---
As for the Axe/Axe thing, I wouldn't suggest mainhand Axe at all as it's not as efficient as other mainhand weapons as it doesn't provide good damage (Sword is more efficient, with the acceptable option of Dagger if you have Soulbeast) nor as many condition stacks as the Double-Shortbow condition build (in alternative, dagger+torch is the meta for condi Soulbeast).
---
There's a decent chance the season end legendary trinket will require some of those jewels. Not guaranteed, but pretty likely.
---
Exotics are fine for most content, but fractals above fractal 20 will need ascended gear. They can be crafted or bought from various vendors but some stat combinations are harder than others and some may be locked to certain zones. 
---
Ascended gear is a slow process and you usually get it from a mixture of sources but basically: crafting, crafting specific currency and buying, rare random drops, collections (some quite easy) and one or two stories or achievements. 
---
As with lots of things in GW2, your first piece is the hardest but it gets easier after that after that. 
---
I rate Dungeon difficulty above Living Story (solo) and under Fractal T4. Many still hilariously faceplant at level 80 dungeons (TA, HotW and Arah). Dungeons aren't killed solely because of the nerfed rewards. It is appropriately rewarded for the intended difficulty. However, the meta groups that largely ran daily dungeons find better challenge and profits in daily fractals, raiding and selling raids. The casual groups now have an easier time to accumulate gold through mats and tag farms like SW, BF, Istan. The new players intimidated by the absence of LFG activities would dismiss dungeons as a great source of newbie content. The only people who run dungeons currently are those in need of dungeon tokens or simply because of nostalgia.  
---
TL, DR: Dungeons are ignored by players due to the shift of interest in other more lustrously profitable areas. They are also built on ancient engines which are nearly impossible to expand and improve upon.
---
I'm going to start sending cakes and pies. (I have a character named I LOVE CAKE AND PIE) 
---
Yeah they're adding new armor pieces and sets quite regularly now. Love it. 
---
Hi, Dummy!
---
There's a whole community for GW2 roleplayers, where people list their guilds. You can even post a profile for your character. If it's your first time role-playing, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with basic ettiqute and terms like "god modding" or "meta gaming". That much can be done with a Google search, and will help you avoid any faux paus. 
---
I even have my own sylvari RP guild listed in the NA guilds. :) I hope you find some fun and friends in the community! We're a friendly bunch.
---

If people could stop taking pictures of their computer screen with their camera, that'd be great.

You would end up with necromancer ; P
---
&gt; the first few comments  
---
&gt; Everyone in this thread  
---
Or just post it from your PC?
---
This!! Pleast Anet! 
---
I agree with having easy 10man, HOWEVER there has to be only one version of said content. The fact that we have one time CMs and non-cms is enough variety. Hindsight is important and atm this is a talking point in WoW how different difficties split player bases and negatively impact the game long term. All the people that participate in the content need to be doing the same content. 
---
If we have stuff that impact the difficulty of a single person, like in the latest living story mission, where one can choose to do take less dmg and do more dmg and etc. with individual character buffs and receive less personal loot if they enable it, then that would probably be a good place to be at. However depending on how that scales we also don't know if people won't start demanding that buff or if it is hidden, if people won't try to get carried for more loot.
---
All things considered, if push comes to shove - I'd rather we have only one universal raid difficulty with different bosses having varying skill requirements (pretty much how they are now) vs an easy, a normal and a CM version of the same boss/raid.
---
Norn can shapeshift? Oh yeah, I forgot that. Since it never happens.
---
I've never had a problem understanding any of them myself.
---
Affects the tonic, too.
---
Hmm, the feels going on. You selected nice footage but you have to stitch then better together. Sometimes the audio cuts or starts ti abruptly. Need some fades.
---
Also, so in Aurene's vision of her multiple deaths, she saw herself die in the exact same position she did die in? Hm.
---
I think NA TTS still does them. I used to do it with them all the time. I've gotten 300+ commendation with them.
---
Yep, https://ttsgamers.com/event-calendar/. Apparently there are four active sub-guilds doing them so hopefully one of them fits your play schedule.
---
Okay, I understand, thank you. Sounds useful anyway.
---
Is there a Skritt wearing a backpack as a backpack? Anet pls.
---
I've found LS content to be a bit boring to do alone, so I'll bench that for when my friends pick this game back-up. Should I just jump into HoT content or am I mssing things by not finishing LS2 first?
---
Also, all that new mastery crap, is that on a character basis or is that account wide?
---
Ah yes, the glory of fiery greatsword, ice bow, and Norn bear form. :)
---
ESO has an outfit system like that. Each character has one "outfit" that covers up the armor skins, and more outfits per character can be bought through the Crown Store, so you can switch between styles as appropriate.
---
Of course, ESO's outfit/transmutation system works a little be differently (you can mix and match armor weights, for instance), but depending on what the coding of GW2 looks like, it might not be an impossible venture.
---
&gt; When unidentified dye was expensive 
---
man I just discovered I have over 700 unid dyes stashed =p should've sold those..
---
Anet better not stop working on gw2 until we have had underwater weapons made into terrestrials with especs
---
" Guides suggest viper instead of my current rabid+dire equip. Seems a bit  strange to me. if I understand the stats right, the viper stat set will make dots tick for a lesser amount of damage but prolong their lifetime  to make more ticks? "
---
The real question was - is sacrificing conditional damage to get condition duration worth it. Basically, rabid -&gt; viper stat change. Tooltips take care of the basic explanation what stats do.
---
Nice thank you
---
Thanks
---
&gt; they exist
---
Incorrect. They *existed*. There is no contemporary evidence that horses exist anywhere on Tyria. Horses, Mursaat, Aloe Seeds &amp; Husks, Wendigo, Hecatombs, and Iguana all existed on Tyria at one point and there's no evidence that any of them exist currently.
---
I mean, she can still appear in cutscenes and open world chats and you could summon her golem independantly.
---
One of the Awakened Olmakhan actually showed up in this episode as well - chatting with their best buddy, who was over the moon that they had returned. 
---
lol my 6 year old asura thief is named solanum tuberosum. We could've been good friends.
---
Random odds, small sample sets. Your individual results will vary.
---
There are many"collections" in the game that do not award AP and some people have asked for them to be added. Dye collections, several minipets, wardrobe unlocks, home nodes, cats, mount skins, etc. 
---
I'm personally glad we don't have an AP hunt for everything...
---
It's nice that people often ask about this, but doing guild missions is actually a service to the guild. They benefit from you being there, so I don't think you need to feel bad about it. Show up for missions, maybe be neighborly and talk to people a little, and no one should have any reason to be upset.
---
Who wants to look like Logan?! I never hated a NPC so much. 
---
Can’t dive deep but want to say thanks for the work. 
---
If control is least dropped, I’m not sure why supply is increasing and price dropping. Maybe demand for nullification has peaked?
---
What you're saying is we want to be a hero not the hero.
---
I don't have an ascended weapon yet, is this a good way to get a staff?
---
I love it!! &lt;3
---
Didn’t Blackgate get the first reworked Teq kill? And then people immediately guested with no end to get into their servers, clogged them up with worse people and they had a super hard time ever killing it again? :^]
---
That would be nice. But then look at the cost benefit to implementing all the new code. What problem would it be addressing? Yayy players can break up outfits now.
---
It will give no benefit to Anet to do changes like that now. The best we can hope for is a reduction in outfits and an increase in armor sets (ex: primeval armor).
---
But yea, my main point was just to explain outfits. Seems like most people hate them here without understanding who they are really for. I do like your idea just don't see it happening anytime
---
You should be able to jump into HoT, but you'll be missing some story cues if that bothers you. 
---
If I didn't already think spiders are super cool, this would have indeed done it.
---
Very nice.  
---
(Getting a Homestuck vibe.)
---
Except that’s not the point. The OP is trying to highlight the fact that the Dragonsblood weapon set were not only given an AP based collection, but that they also were given more attention as a new collection. The stellar collection simply wasn’t. They are right in making such a request, for the sake of AP continuity.  
---
The OP made zero mention of not wanting to do them because of a lack of AP’s associated w the collection. So not sure why your response needs to be semi-patronizing.
---
I‘m a Sylvari tho
---
It's easy with Griffon, there's several routes to take. Without griffon, you need to map break.
---
But they do not play GW2 from their phone.
---
Therefore they are on a PC, and have access to a Print Screen button. Why are phones even getting involved?
---
Hardly rocket science.
---
Not exactly unnoticed. I remember many comments regarding the cost of crafting them, which many thought to be steep. I personally crafted the torch because I needed one and liked this one. 
---
Do you also play GW2 from your phone? No? There you go then. No paranoia required.
---
Noticed that on wiki a few hours after posting this. Not sure how I missed it despite running through the instance a few times.
---
While I'm on board with things that alter old maps and shake things up, I don't think the answer is more shit turned into purple crystal.
---
Because they don't have reddit access for some reason on their pc. Also that can be done and posted in a matter of seconds rather than having to screenshot crpp save upload while being tabbed out of the game possibly. 
---
That outfit should have been new cultural armor 
---
Interestingly enough, if Caithe does the exact opposite I'm probably still gonna cry. Mostly because I don't think I (and the Commander) deserve it after what just happened.
---
A lot of my characters have story! Some more fleshed out than others. My Charr main runs through story first before my canon one, but she's a Vigil Warmaster (her armor skins have never changed in the years after I got her the Vigil skins, except when the peg leg and hook came out because she also has prosthetics and I can finally put that on her character model), and is also more Norn than Charr (that also requires a lot of backtracking into other games I've put her in, to include Skyrim, where the idea originally came from).
---
My actual Commander hails from Dragon Age: Origins, as a City Elf Warden. A City Elf Warden that romanced Leliana (see where I'm going with this?).
---
&gt;	Please don’t longbow 4 push enemies out of aoe. This is the most annoying thing rangers do.
---
Nothing like stacking up a lava font, firestorm, and fully channeling a meteor shower on some big HoT monster only to have a ranger thwack it to safety.
---
&gt; the Six
---
Better sit down, I#ve got some bad news for you...
---
Special Ability: Raise blue, red and white flags at the towers of Vale Guardian, which form a freedom banner while you call in an airstrike on the boss.  
---
Getting some Persona 5 vibes. Very nice.
---
Don't know if the charr and sylvari ones are like that anymore but I think they used to be
---
Yeah I know, the Six are at the center of the Mobile Game they've been working on 😁
---
Never had a problem here. =/
---
I'm not sure if I understand the new system. I'm not getting any of these as drops when I salvage gear. I sometimes get the little hourglass-looking item that goes into material storage. 
---
If it's floating, how can it weigh anything?
---
Dwarves don't transform. Female dwarves have beards.
---
Not mini norn!
---
Raichu, use Psychinium Z!
---
So much this. I realised that with Logan's outfit which is nice itself, but the shoulders just wreck that look. Also I almost always hide the shoulder skins on the characters which still use the armor sets.
---
Ah yes, the ol' F5-with-2.131.200 clones trick.
---
Well the solution is simple, buff race skills and let other races earn those skills by playing the game.
---
I'm a WoW veteran myself, enjoying GW2. Got over 1.6k hours already. 
---
This game is not perfect, has its own pros and cons, but overall it's amazing.
---
Btw, I'm weaver main too. If you got any questions, feel free to whisper me in-game (moveon.6071). 
---
Makes me think I'm on /r/superbowl
---
nice piece of work there, as a person who owns both of those last two items it gave me a real chuckle cos the statement is correct, they are expensive lol
---
big "social" guilds ussually do guild missions weekly. These kind of guilds ussually have a mix of both new and veteran players so it's a good way they have to "socialize" and do things together once a week. Of course, at this point of the game i wouldn't expect one of this guilds to do these missions more than once a week.
---
If you make CMs give rewards just once, people will have less reasons to repeat them, too many people would do CM just once, then forget about it, and new players would find less people to do CMS.  
---
* So it's better for all CM rewards to be repeatable.  
---
And people have limited time, and over time more raids will be added, and there's other things to do in the game. It would not be very fun to have to do both every week to get full rewards.  
---
* So it's better when it works like fractal tiers. Get both normal and CM rewards when doing CM.
---
But if every boss gets a CM, and they gave full CM rewards every week, that would split people between those who do CM, and those who do not.  And that is not the most desirable situation. 
---
To make sure both CM and normal raiders groups will mingle every now and then, and to increase the changes of new players getting to do CMs, and to have normal raiders doing the jump to CM more frequently, one solution that would quite probably work is making so the CM rewards are only repeatable when the corresponding raid has the call of the mists.   
---
That would make more likely to have CMS repeated with reasonable frequency, while also alternating CM and non-CM parties mingling for wings that do not have the call of the mists. By having them mingle, it'll be more likely that a player that joined a normal run may also join the same people for a CM one.   
---
The CM-normal split would still happen, but it would be isolated to the wings with bonuses each week, so those who do not want to do the jump to CM can still find parties for the wings they want when those wings do not have the Call. 
---
It's a compromise that gets you a bit of the best of all worlds.
---
Ah yeah on sylvari I did not mean to have them floating but it does look like it
---
That's was not a bear, it was a [griffon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/6/68/Deldrimor_ranger.jpg):
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:Projects/NPC_models/Dwarves
---
She looks great. Caithe is one of the more fascinating characters. Major props to her VA as well, who really gives a nuanced performance. 
---
Okay, thank you.
---
Challenge Mode is just another name for Hard Mode.
---
There are, and that's why I was hesitant. It wouldn't really offer much new, but I hadn't seen it mentioned for a mount yet.
---
When I read "Dueling mesmers", since they are a profession usually tied to the 'fine arts', what I picture is [this](https://youtu.be/gsC4kf6x_Q0).
---
One of my favorite mount skins in the game, I use it on several characters and have to remind myself that not every character needs to use it haha
---
I would be much happier about the instability change in general and a lot less angry about Slippery Slope if I wasn't convinced that it's gonna take a couple of months (at least) to be changed/removed IF the issues with it are even going to be acknowledged.
---
I feel you. My main male character was SUPER hard to put together a good look for until they released the new armors in episode 4. Nothing I could come up with felt at all right.
---
I remember I kept thinking to myself that it looked like the other armor classes would have had more options for him, but after looking through the medium ones... no. Not really. I probably still wouldn't have been happy.
---
Hopefully they put out an option like that soon. 
---
Cheers!
---
GoE really doesn’t add all that much, even in a zerk comp. The spirits are exceptionally important, but that’s about the only vital irreplaceable thing that druids bring.
---
I genuinely chuckled in work reading this, well played.
---
quick question, are those spiders actual enemies or critters?
---
Noob here - Which shoulders are they?
---
"Anet please let us hide shoulderpieces on outfits"  
---
"Anet please let us hide gloves on outfits"  
---
"Anet please let us hide boots on outfits"  
---
"Anet please let us hide.."  
---
It applies everywhere. And it's not gonna happen.
---
Have you tried aggro-ing 7-8 at once and killing them all together, I think leaving combat ruins the achievement.
---
yes
---
Due to how common arachnophobia is, they would lose A LOT of potential customers (for the mount and the skins).
---
I personally am okay with fighting the spiders in Deep Stone even though they bring me shivers. But i would DEFINITELY not buy a spider mount, nor spider skins.
---
Very!  And there's a free model that is effectively the entire base game.  It's definitely worth trying out, at the very least.
---
[Winter's presence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Winter%27s_Presence_Skin) and [nightfury](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightfury_Skin)
---
There is a lot of people playing, if you are in a zone with very few players, it will tell you and let you transfer to a more populated server. Just have to remember the game has been out for a long time and it will take awhile to get your footing with all the content.
---
The first option won't work for OP either because he is an engi so he doesn't have a weapon swap.
---
And as important as fashion war is, I can't even imagine manually equipping a pistol or something each time I'm ooc (and you can't reequip your shield if you enter a combat you didn't plan)
---
Just show some initiative in any guild and you'll do them all.
---
All I want to ask ist: How is this exactly a trailer? I know that trailers are always a bit spoilery but nobody that hasn't played the episode should basically watch this.
---
Apart from that: Nice work, really impressive!
---
To add some context, Winter's Presence is a skin from the wintersday event requiring completing collections, consuming 10k drinks, playing the different games, etc and Nightfury is from the Halloween events (though is easier to obtain as you can just buy everything as nothing is tied to an event with it), both of these together make up around 1300g :P
---
I rather get my armor skins from playing the game (like it is currently) than buying them via gems...
---
On boss with no phase (like Mo), GoE improve zerk dps by 3.5% on boss. 
---
On boss with burst phase like you said (like KC or CA), it is really important because you can have 100% of the buff (+10%).
---
On boss with split phase (like Gors, Samarog, Sloth) , you can have more % of GoE than boss with no phase because you keep it during invu phase and only use it when you can dps the boss.
---
But GoE is not why you have to bring druid, I agree. You have to bring druid because if not, you have to replace it by at least 3 classes... and it is not worth it.
---
Druid bring spirit, might for 10, fury and speed for 5, heal, a good package of utility (immo, cc, grab, condi clean).
---
Gorgeous!
---
Thank you, very much appreciated!
---
The Desolation kill one was actually Triple Trouble. It released the same day as Marionette, and commanders were going back and forth without sleep for insane periods of time.
---
Tequatl got it's first kill pretty quick. 
---
Accurate.
---
Someone explain?
---
The styrographs and the right mesmer make me think of Homestuck.
---
Do you even play wvw? Why would we need a mount for that mode? We need actual updates not more gimmicks causing lags
---
Since your flair says 'Guild wars noob', it's a reference to Guild Wars lore. ;) Back in the first game, the fiery Destroyers of Primordus were rising up from underground and threatening the world, and the dwarves were foremost in leading the opposition against them.  They performed the Rite of the Great Dwarf, a ritual that transformed the race as a whole into living statues, to better be able to fight the Destroyers.  Doing so largely sacrificed their individuality, though, with most of the dwarves becoming a hivemind dedicated solely to Destroyer destruction.  As we've seen in GW2 from the few surviving statue dwarves, there were a handful of individuals able to escape that mental fate, but all the dwarves are still made out of stone, unable to reproduce, and in at least one case shattered into pieces and rather grumpy about it.
---
Yes, and I've been wanting it fixed for ages
---
This pretty much sums it up. I'm a Revenant Class Lead in a major WvW guild, have about 1,500 hours playtime on a Revenant, and suck big time using a Centaur healing build (as a Renegade). Moving the tablet so that it's useful is nearly impossible unless you have chokes or favorable terrain, AND the commander moves slowly and deliberately. If there were a trait that allowed the tablet to auto-move with you it'd be super-viable, but as it is it's mostly useless.  
---
The build not only heals well, but also provides 100% Alacrity uptime for your party AND for siege, so it'd be great if it weren't for the movement issue.
---
They won't do that, because they want races to be a cosmetic choice. They don't want to to choose a race based on its racial skills. Maybe it would be cool if they buffed them in Open World, since it's not competitive content.
---
Am I the only one who thought of Bayonetta? xD
---
I assume there are several guilds that do them weekly maybe even on multiple days.  I am in 2 guilds that run the guild events.  1 does them on Sunday afternoons which I generally miss.  And the other runs them on Wednesday nights of which I pretty much always make that one.  And I know other guilds run them at the same time on Wednesday as when we go from one event to another we often see the same 2 or 3 other guilds at the same events.  
---
At least in the Wednesday group they are the pve setup, that has 1 pvp event (which we don't run as it usually bugged out when we did try to run it and it always ended up a logistically pain to get it for more than a couple people) and 1 wvw event which depending on what it is we run.  I do use them but I gain guild commendations much faster then I spend them and currently have about 1800 of them.  
---
I would assume just map chat in Lions Arch should find you a guild for the guild events.
---
Its not rly a raid...more like a 10 man fractal/dungeon difficulty wise 
---
THWACK
---
Condi FB praticly cover fury alone with Axe and elite. If your chrono is playing Inspi, Fury is cover.
---
Makes for great animated wallpaper.  Good job!
---
Easily one of the best MMO's around currently. I've been through a lot including World of Warcrack, but this has a very unique design that keeps you wanting more.
---
So true, lol. I did buy Nightfury, though. It's the only shoulder skin I use. My characters are Night cycle Sylvari with dark skin colors so it always matches. :)
---
Char model limit - low 
---
Char model limit quality -low 
---
one gives you hypothermia and one gives you ebolaids
---
You are welcome!
---
Ah, I see
---
Well, the appeal that I personally find in it is the ability to be something I'm not, and it's just fun to try and create a realistic character. I'm not an edgy cat man with a drinking problem in real life but it's still fun to step outside my own shoes for a change
---
Taking your 0.0001% literally would mean, that everybody would be rich after 2 hour of playing.
---
0.0001% drop chance is waay too high. :P
---
Not today, maybe in the future. 
---
Yeah it wasn't difficult at all (as someone who never tried raids or went above T1 fractals). Just read the wiki page about the mechanics beforehand, and you'll be all right.
---
Obviously. I was just correcting the guy who said Insp chrono covers whole squad.
---
Astrlaria please!!
---
You need to play 1 mission in HoT and 1 mission in PoF to unlock masteries as a whole, and also to get access to expansion specific masteries.
---
More bang for my buck than the price of a movie...
---
but do not get me wrong, i also thing the chrono+fb+rene is the new meta 
---
in the double chrono+druid comp is the fury problem really cancer both chronos need pack rune and have to trigger it befor boss fight starts and the chrono where dont in teh druid grp is have to pick banner for fury at start.
---
As someone with arachnophobia I really hope it isn't. Most if not all mounts have a specific use. If they make a spider mount that would mean that I prolly HAVE TO use it at some point. While I can deal with other people's spider minis, pets or potential mounts, I won't like the fact that I am the one using/controlling it.
---
&gt; To give a bit of perspective about the uneven distribution, I've scraped the API to count how many weapons and pieces of armors are related to a given element. I only counted gear whose level is between 77 and 80, that can be salvaged and is not account bound.
---
Until now, I only made in depth research into the exotic drop loot table from what i learned there, I can draw some conclusions why your API scraping uncovered quite a different distribution.
---
On the exotic loot table were only generic weapons (those we talking about here) level 76-79 but not sure if its the same rule for rare and masterwork generic weapons.
---
&gt; I imagine most of the items you identified turned out to be of masterwork quality
---
Thats right, the bulk of your charms and symbols will come from identified green gear (unless you identify rare unids)
---
&gt; the symbol of pain-related weapons outnumber other weapons (160 vs 79 vs 29), yet each of these 160 weapons is available on the TPthat is, appear in https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/commerce/prices. Only 16 are post-vanilla game (the 16 reclaimed weapons with a sigil of earth), the other 144 are your regular trash loot you salvage without noticing it.
---
this seems to be reason. On your wiki page, when scraping for masterwork gear, you got a very high result for weapons with minor sigil of earth (117), so I investigated. [Here](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/tp/search?name=earth&amp;rarity=Masterwork&amp;type=Weapon&amp;level-min=76&amp;ipg=200&amp;sort=name&amp;cust-search=sell%2Cbuy%2Cprofit%2Cprofit-pct%2Csupply%2Cdemand%2Csold-day%2Coffers-day%2Cbought-day%2Cbids-day%2Clevel&amp;page=1) is a list of all tradeable masterwork level 76-80 weapons with an earth sigil. Its quite obvious that there is a substantial amount of dire and shaman weapons but I am fairly certain that unid gear only drops the core vanilla stats (Berserker, Clerics, Valkyrie, Rampager, Carrion, Assassin, Knight).
---
So you would need to exclude any weapons and armor that have other stats from your scraping.
---
I did it yesterday with my Soulbeast, first off all u had not to equip axe, second u can use beast mode(only keep in mind u had to stay under 10% of the unmerged health.) i did use the black baer. For 2 extra invuln with sigel of stone. I had done it on a normal Power Slb with Lb and Gs. 
---
According to a person on Discord it is important that u relog after some trys. The Achivment is a kind of buggy

&gt;There was this well hidden cave with tiny Quaggans somewhere in the world. One of the Quaggans was always singing. It was a precious little gem.
---
this sounds like the jumping puzzle, [Coddler's Cove](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coddler%27s_Cove)
---
Nice, nice. I actually recently dropped WoW because BFA doesn't feel solid to me at least (to each their own).
---
Including the recent:
---
Gorrik: "Great! You got it, now get out of there before the Brandstorm takes you! Flee for your lives!"
---
Canach: "VICTORIOUSLY, flee for our lives!"
---
Logan: "Just run, Canach!"
---
im scared of spiders too but really? its just a game and they're not that realistic. but im not trying to invalidate your phobia, i guess they could make 2 starter skins one spider and one sth else of similar structure 
---
So I don't have to have the killing blows with the axe? Hell, I'm using my shortbow.
---
A'ight, spill it. What'd you buy? :) 
---
Caithe bloom dagger? Logan Pact armor?
---
shoulder pads that are the same size as my character's head is the bane of my life 
---
Not true. All that's required is the chrono not in the druid sub has pack runes (no need to pretrigger) and someone in the group Discipline banner 2s at the start for the first round of SoI. It will be maintained from there with no effort.
---
The Revenant's "Legendary Assassin Stance" gives us a taste of the Assassin playstyle, especially with dual swords, but I feel like there's still design space to create an Assassin Elite Spec for the Thief. Consider that the Thief has a lot more stealth effects/backstab/etc effects and the Legendary Assassin Stance has little to none of that (it has zero stealth gameplay, at least).
---
Creating a dual-sword Assassin Elite Spec for Thief could even be more support-like in effect, if they wanted. Hear me out: less Power and Condi Damage, more CC to lock down enemies/break bosses and more ally-stealthing/boon sharing. A single Assassin rarely gets the job done with large marks, so enabling your allies to assist in the kill would have a higher assurance rate, no? Think a bit like Shen in LoL, tanking and disabling enemies, shielding and enabling allies.
---
Wake up. WAKE UP!!! He did kill them. Don’t you get it? We were Awakened by Joko. Our deeds were/are his deeds. Our lord isn’t dead and will return. This has always been the plan! Praise the great and benevolent Lord Joko.
---
This has always been the plan. He doesn’t want to kill Kralk, he wants to awaken him...or become him... hard to tell. 
---
I can never get through them, you're not alone.
---
Of course you are right. Easy mode as in separate version with different mechanics is an absolute no-go. It would eat up time spend on making new raids/fractals.
---
But there's been several ideas already that would increase stats of players. From "trainings armor" you can lend in aerodrome, to this newest idea of buffs that increase dmg while decreasing dmg dealt.
---
The point of easy mode is to take players this "angsty feeling" they have when someone simply says "raids". And to offer trainingwheels to make it easier on trainingsquads.
---
As for loot... honestly... I think the only difference between easy mode and normal mode in terms of loot should be:
---
a) a lower shard cap and
---
b) no chance of specialty items (dhuum bench, etc.)
---
Everything else should stay the same. Ascended, exotics, bags. You need incentive for players to even start raiding. And that would put easy mode raids before t4 fractals in terms of difficulty and natural progression, which is exactly right.
---
This is an absolute BS argument that Anet have parrotted as well. Armor is NOT that high-quality that it takes this long. Most armor has clipping/other issues. They don't need to worry about this. If this IS a concern for them, they're making their jobs harder than they have to. Cut the outfit apart and roughly stitch a few vertices in place and color them dark so it's not really obvious. The Logan outfit in particular is a really striking example of this. Are you seriously telling me that they can't cut those shoulderpads off and make them their own skin? Or the helmet which is literally already separate? I can see the chest and leggings causing problems but, again, do it quick and dirty and let people who want to Fashion Wars find their own solutions (i.e. covering over rough cuffs with larger gloves, etc.).
---
It makes absolutely no sense. They have already made the armor/outfit fit every race and gender, that is not a valid excuse. They're doing it because it makes them a lot of money and I'm proposing they CONTINUE selling it for money while also providing it as a large gold grind for players.
---
They also matter for raids as well actually. NA and EU cannot join the same raid instances.
---
there's quite a bunch of dwarven chests on the new map placed on places exactly like that. Mounts don't fit on those places so the only way to get there is gliding from a higher position or using the new mount ability granted by the new mastery "Bond of Faith". (they are probably designed to use the later).
---
On the one you show on the image both raptor and griffon (and maybe jackal) could get you there but all of them would force you to use the new mastery to dismount/jump at the last moment because the mount itself is unable to land there.
---
Thought you meant challenge motes.
---
Just an ascended Aurene, which won't be Aurene, the same way Godess Kormir isn't mortal Kormir.

Horses are a myth. No horses.

A post which has real representation of what dueling mesmer feels like would belong in NSFW.

What? Are my eyes just not working? I only see pinkish red...
---
The thing is, it's literally one dev that does the talking. He also likes to hang out on Twitch and in discord, so thats where shareable info tends to end up first. It's worth noting that Ben has always made it very clear that anything that is shared on these platforms is the same information that would be shared on the forums. 
---
look at SC discord, mesmer channel i dont remember the name atm
---
yeah 600 range is nice but you still have boss mechanics, if you miss Soi or Pack 6 you have to wait for new boons
---
i dont say double chrono is impossible, but is worse then fb+ren+chrono in my opinion, i dont like it cuz i am chrono main but the last 2 weeks i get better results in my static with the new comp vs 2x chrono
---
If you think that they check for clipping, you haven't unlocked enough armor pieces. There's multiple pieces of armor (mostly pauldrons) that literally do not have a reverse side to the mesh (i.e. it is invisible when seen from the other side). Also individual dye channels, what? They already have those. I hate people who say "this is just two lines of code" but this literally is that easy. They have already made the outfit fit for all races/genders. There is no more work to be done on the development/design side besides slicing it up and I swear to Jesus if someone thinks that's too difficult, I will volunteer my time to cut the model apart myself.
---
This is a corporate decision, not a practical one.
---
To sum up, you replace an offensive druid and 1 dps by 1 Tempest and 1 Power Soulbeast ? Interresting, I want to see this in video =)  
---
A quick question, you don't have any heal with this compo no ? (even if offensive druid heal is not much) 
---
Personnaly, if you have to bring an Harrier Ren to bring heal, I don't think replacing druid is really usefull but it's an alternative.
---
There has not been a balance patch before the season for the last 5-6 seasons.
---
Shoulders, helmets, and boots are fine, that has been done before (Brahms wolf outfit) the issue is always the chest and legging.
---
You can't tell me that the Logan pact armor legging can be cut wherever and made to fit into any female human light chest armor, for example. It'll look ridiculous.
---
They should have a summit where all the races come together and teach each other their skills.. albeit the humans would be weird 
---
Well if it is not being branded, I'm pretty sure it's just simply about playing with your mind, that doesn't exclusively needs dragon magic
---
The new entity would be Aurene, but not Aurene. I don't think Glint mentioning Ascension to her was just a coincidence.
---
The difference is that 1. PoF had more opportunities to be out in the maps (bounties, races, etc.) and 2. The maps had shit to do in them, small stories told via the events, etc. This map is DoA.
---
Winter's Presence isn't that expensive. You just have to successfully do the Wintersday jumping puzzle for like 60 or so hours.
---
I've noticed that a considerate amount of those against easy mode are just raid sellers.
---
I want to raid with my noob friends. I don't want to carry them, and they don't want to be carried.
---
You obviously don't play PvP. I thought my quote was clear. You can get all the rewards you can when season is on, aka chest rewards from ranked season. Reward tracks from ranked season and off season is the same, except for the reward chests and ascended shards you get in ranked play. Pips count towards reward chests so can only gain when ranked season is on. The leggy wings only count for ranked season. 
---
Off season, there are unranked, and ranked matches. They are 2 different pools. Ranked matches have no whatsoever rewards in ranked besides reward tracks. You'd be asking then why people play ranked matches in off season? Because the pools of players are better and you can only solo or duo que and not full premade 5 man like in unranked. That's the difference. The skills cap is day and night. 
---
Just because the season is off doesn't mean people stop playing PvP. This is why PvP folks need the off season to rest and do some in house practices. One or two weeks are just not enough and it's really tiredsome to already force yourself to be ready when a new season is on. 
---
&gt; Personnaly, if you have to bring an Harrier Ren to bring heal, I don't think replacing druid is really usefull but it's an alternative.
---
It's more about making it possible to replace your chronos without two-healing. If you're willing to two-heal (or if you want to for other reasons), then you don't have to replace the Druid; it's still an exceptional class so long as you're willing to carry a second healer. Taking a Harrier Renegade gives you hilariously higher healing with ten man alacrity, enabling the quickbrands.
---
Condi Quickbrand is the real goal here, given its massive DPS advantage over support Chrono.
---
Back in MY day we had CITIZENS standing at entrance in LA docks and Cliffside with long way up with [hammer which could land in the middle of air](https://i.imgur.com/OVEzj3d.jpg) and since there was no gg yet implemented, people had to suicide
---
Horses currently don't exist on Tyria. Your persistence while being completely incapable of proving me wrong is hilarious.
---
PvE streaming, even if small, is far bigger than PvP streaming anyway.
---
Heroic Dragonsblood weapons (ascended) do NOT have infusion slots. 
---
You haven't proved yourself right. I've given you evidence provided from your own source. You just keep saying "nope." What about this evidence is wrong then? You haven't challenged it.
---
Yes, very much so. I'm not sure of how many, but due to the mega servers and how the game is designed, you'll often see people. 
---
why is it labeled twice?
---
You really want more raids? This gets you that, the more people doing raids the more time the devs can justify developing new ones. It’s a simple win win case there’s no need to get defensive.
---
Kill yerself and go bek 2 wow
---
Ok, I actually went and checked that, Reaper is one of the highest with 27k (the Condi reaper showed 29k, no idea what that is haha). The only thing higher was dragon Hunter with less than 1k more and Deadeye with 33k. Now those are top numbers, if you look at mid, reaper pulls ahead of both of them. Soooo idk what your getting at.
---
&gt;Lon-ami comenta en [Spoilers] Guys, wait - What if the story isn't what we thought
---
My point is that those changes for the worse started happening long before Activision came in.
---
Those cancelled WotLK features I mentioned, were actively advertised in trailers and other promotional materials. The good old Blizzard mantra "when it's ready" has long been thrown away. To date, they still scrap multiple features with every expansion, some of them proving fatal in the bigger picture.
---
D3's loot was proven to be rigged again and again. It was pretty much impossible to complete Act 1 on inferno without very rare drops that took months to farm. Then some players managed to skip the finale and advance to Act 2, were most common loot was better than Act's 1 best. Result? Why bother farming when you can just buy it. And I'm not even getting into the abundant shady movement of items, which many suspect were listed by the company itself, since none of the top players and communities ever saw them drop.
---
D3 was also supposed to be a trilogy, from the very early leaks. We even got recent confirmation that the second expansion was cancelled, by Activision's influence.
---
just looked this up on the wiki, and holy shit that's a garbage achievement
---
what labels you mean?
---
Mashed potatoes!
---
The lack of cohesion between the different game modes in GW2 is really damning. Everything should be integrated into a single story, yet it isn't.
---
The Mists are also a huge mistake. The PvP arenas should be part of the real world, and WvW should represent current real world battlefields.
---
Ah, I see the problem. You believe that seeing horses in the past proves that horses must exist now. So then there must also be Mursaat, iguanas, etc. on Tyria. That's an interesting delusion. Completely ridiculous and unsupportable, but interesting none the less.
---
Most of my 12 commanders have found some good ones
---
TTGL is a better mecha anime then Evangelion. Change my mind.
---
Explain how in 6 years they went extinct. Seeing something in *recent* past is a lot of evidence. Coupled with circumstantial evidence that shows Kryta uses Equine creatures (as I noted above, the only evidence of any equine creature existing in Kryta is the horse)
---
You're supposed to be leading an army yet you just wander around with clone-nobodies doing random errands.
---
It's just cheap children show "cool factor". Oh look, I'm the COMMANDER, how cool is that? wow! Lot of barking, and not an ounce of biting.
---
The bat shoulders still bother me to this day.
---
Anet : “everyone has too much money we need an item that makes people spend money to decrease inflation”
---
*creates bat shoulders*
---
Everyone : “wow this is a really cool cosmetic anet, I’m totally gonna get it when it comes out”
---
Anet : “glad you guys like it, it only costs more than most people have even if they liquidated their account, it’s also only for a limited time”
---
*very few people get it*
---
Anet : “why didn’t anyone get it?”
---
They could have made several items that cost less and then had more people spend money but instead they made one item not a lot or people got. Ultimately not solving the problem they wanted to solve. 
---
Scouts get rewards now. A squad leader can pick a number of people that get same objective rewards as the zerg.

You're just not seeing them. [Check this page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zone).

Yeah, and it costs 600g for the runes/sigils.

With diviner gear (or before commander), chrono duel illu can keepup boons alone, no need of a second chrono.  
---
That being said, you need to have people staying in your wells and that makes it a bit complicated to run this build on every enounter. It's meant to be played either in fractals or bosses like MO, cairn, sabetha, ... I guess you could play it on Xera, gorse if aegis is taken care by fbd, maybe VG and some others bosses but well, it might make it weird. 
---
Okay thank you.
---
It is in fact really fucking expensive, and the fact that you can farm the puzzle for hours on end doesnt take anything away from said price. That JP is very lucrative alright, but at the end of the day you're still sinking about 800 gold into a single skin of shoulderpads.
---
Also, the same can be said about Nightfury, because the Labyrinth from the Halloween event serves the exact same purpose as Wintersday's puzzle. And at the very least, Nightfury is an actual piece of ascended gear, not just a skin.
---
Last panel makes me crack up. Good job!
---
I've never felt more insulted 
---
As others have said, I think it would make a excellent trailer for LWS4E5 if you cut it about 50 seconds shorter. As it is in full length, it makes for a great overview of/tribute to Aurene.

My [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/magicnaanavi/) and [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/magicnaanavi) are usually up to date. I will eventually post them here after I have animated versions ready too.
---
&gt; The source you link states equine creatures are being used at the time of the game beginning.
---
I'm sorry. You can't just make things up and pretend they're true. This includes the made up information in the wiki which is maintained by the community and is 100% non-canon. If you're going to read the wiki, you need to read it with the understanding that it can be edited by anyone and anything found in it may be nonsense.
---
The specific reference you seem to be talking about says "As recently as 1325 AE, Krytans used equines to pull carts and carriages in Queensdale.", but that's nonsense because if you bother to look at the footnote you'll see that statement is based solely on the presence of hoofprints and cart tracks near the hunting lodge. Since there's no difference between the hoofprints and cart tracks made by a horse pulling a cart and those made by a centaur pulling a cart, the presumption that it must have been a horse is ridiculous.
---
You've made an unsupported assumption based on somebody else's unsupported assumption and then you expect the rest of the world to accept your assumption as true. I'm not sure what the technical term for that would be, but I suspect a psychologist would have a word for it.
---
&gt; Until something is told to you that it doesn't exist the default assumption is that it does.
---
Right. Then I'll be double-checking everywhere to see if I can find my Maserati. Arenanet has never said that it's not in the game, so it must be somewhere.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the joke :)  I don’t appreciate the arbitrary-ness of thread removal - mods are human, but there are objectively comparable things here that don’t make sense wholistically. 
---
I had the same issue and fix.
---
Though I imagine it's not limited to just arcdps, so if the OP has other mods/addons, definitely look into that first. Otherwise, it's just looking at the usual gamut of drivers, reinstall, etc.
---
:( tried it just now again
---
&gt;but I suspect a psychologist would have a word for it.
---
You've been incredibly passive aggressive throughout this whole thread but this one takes the cake. If you're correct in your statements you can do it without the insults. But please keep doing it. You claim its funny that I care about this, but I think its even funnier that you care enough to continue to engage *with insults* instead of civilly.
---
If you'd like me to continue to entertain you with responses, I will. But I won't engage with you if you're gonna be a dick about it the whole time. 
---
Most of the guides I know of are outdated now, but there is this one https://youtu.be/GAtDKypiS5M that while old still covers the basics when it comes to combos and rotations, learning those is a good start, and once you get them down and get used to all your cd’s you’ll be able to play more reactively with your skills. as for how to build for wvw this is my setup http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJAoYhcMoyhFOwzB8RMQAY1aIJWGiCQAIISZhjQUA-jFyHABzpE0dVV0TtiBOBAA8AA+WPQ47PskyvAAIA7sODgduzduzduzqzduzduzduzduzdWKAWHaB-w if you have any other questions or want some help feel free to contact me in game anytime my in game name is noble.2670
---
The issue I see with this is that, as far as we're aware, dragon corruption is permanent - the control can be broken, but the physical changes cannot be reverted, and I somehow doubt ANet would want to force players to have purple-blue characters, possibly covered in crystals, after a certain point in the story. They could just hand-wave in some easy solution, but that would be an embarrassingly bad writing choice from an otherwise generally competent team. It also can't be permanent, as that runs into the Gilligan's Island problem: it would end the plot. It's an interesting concept, to be sure, but I don't think it really works within the rules and narrative that have already been set out at this point.
---
Nooo, what do you mean? *pokes hole through chin with spike*
---
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS, HOLY SHIT GOD BLESS
---
&gt; Do you also play GW2 from your phone?
---
*something something Guild Wars 3 in 5 years*
---
&gt; if it's done right. 
---
that's big IF considering anet's storytelling
---
Yep, it takes a bit of setting up and tinkering but once it's done... makes the entire process a breeze. Still pretty boring as you have to do all the hearts, but it minimizes the tedium and speeds things up 10 fold. 
---
ANet has talked about it occasionally several times the past year, but they’ve always qualified that it’s a big project and will take a long time. They made a forum post about it in the past month or two iirc that got linked here. Maybe if you search for “WvW update” or something similar you’ll find it.
---
I finally got around to finishing nightfury just before this last Mad King's Festival, only to not use it on a single thing.

u draw next level good, darn! esp the girl looks yum \^\^  but i honestly don't understand the last picture thaha

Aw, no Twilight. The only legendary I ever got. And then really killed my motivation to play afterwards. (Granted, was that period right before the expansion that was really boring. )
---
&gt;Everyone will be searching for the commander who is hiding in the super adventure box festival
---
EP6 Plot leaked.
---
i dont know, kind of ruined by the first character being a female human/norn; possibly the combination with the least shoulder woes
---
Beetles just aren’t as creepy/scary as spiders. And imagine every player in the game crawling around on the walls and ceilings on their spider mounts. That’s a far cry from the occasional stationary spider boss, which are sometimes so big and covered in FX you can’t see it all in your screen and forget what you’re fighting anyway.
---
I used to be big into RP, and there was a humerous, in character sentiment that Mesmers were the most annoying opponents to fight (even when most Mesmer RPers were great, even in combat scenarios). This was agreed upon by most of the RP community 
---
"F*ck Mesmers," was a popular tagline.
---
Sarcasm is, you know, stronk in this one. 
---
Oops, fixed the sigil, thx. And yeah the stat #s for Precision and Conc will be off. 
---
Well he said "weren't" expecting, not "aren't" expecting, so I take it to mean that "before I said this, players weren't expect another mount... Surprise!"
---
I don't have wallpaper engine but the original Nevermore wallpaper is the best I ever had in my life. 
---
I always wanted to have a beautiful wallpaper that has some special meaning to me. I rocked my favourite football club's logo for a few years now, so this was an enormous upgrade.
---
Thanks for making me happy every time I turn on my PC :)
---
I need to fix up a bit the original Twilight artwork first, but the plan is to have all of them animated.  :)
---
League is also a skilless shit show designed to sell this month's 5 meta characters and make you suffer buyer's remorse after the last 30 or so you purchased were all thrown in a dumpster and set on fire. There's nothing in a competitive format that should ever be compared to League except as an example of how to fail at esports balance.
---
I play on an iMac late 2012. I have medium settings on most stuff. The biggest fps gain for me was to switch to subsampling. But I prefer that over no shadows or no shaders. 
---
Text etc stays sharp only the 3D parts will be rendered in a smaller resolution. 
---
But I guess you just have to try to find the best balance (or switch around a lot). 
---
Maybe let's love on stuff without hating on other stuff? Don't have to put something down to prop something else up.
---
^(&gt;:))
---
to confuse you
---
First I'll second what most of the other comments say: get exotic gear. With exotic zerk gear, the pocket raptors will be dead before you finish overloads.
---
A couple of gameplay tips:
---
- In options, turn on "show all enemy names." If you so mordrem sniper with a posse of mordrem thumb-twiddlers, you know what you're up against and who you want to kill first before you get into combat.
---
- Move. With some exceptions, most enemies attack directly in front of them, so running around is often just as effective as dodging.
---
- Enemies play dirty, but so can you. Blinds, stuns, and even immobilize can give you a huge advantage in an otherwise unfair fight.
---
- Don't be afraid to ask for help in map chat. Everyone remembers their first experience with HoT, and yours is pretty common.
---
HoT is pretty punishing (even veteran players will down quickly if they're not paying attention) and ele is known for being relatively squishy and difficult to master since it has so many skills. But if you can learn from this, you'll be in a great position to progress through other endgame content and learning other classes in the future will be easier.
---
lol
---
The bat shoulders are expensive, don't get me wrong, but it's not limited time.  You can get most everything you need for it on the TP outside of the Halloween event.  The gift of Ascalon you'll have to grind for yourself though
---
mfw I finally rip the last defiance stack for my ice bow 5 but some plug thief steals because hes a monkey
---
Damage and boons.
---
yes, thats the case.
---
That Charr face is a riot. lmao
---
do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
---
Recently relocated to EU. Are data centers specific to each continent, or can I easily move my character from US to Europe? If a cost, what is it?
---
Thanks guys , love you &lt;3
---
I was trying to do it on Mirrage - if you don't mind, I will give you my report:  
---
I am on viper (I am aware that condi burst might not count for the achivement based on the fact, that it has to be me killing those mobs, like with slayer achivement).  
---
I have 16500 hp, so i have to be under 1650 hp for the achivement to tick.  
---
Not even trying it solo on branded, because they can one shot me.  
---
First try to test it out. North meta. I'm running around like a mad man, with no heals, tagging everything, waiting for players to kill, screaming to myself  - didn't work.  
---
I went to the spider cave - the same you visited.  
---
Changed my stats, limited amount of clones, ignored shatters, forgot condi damage.  
---
Nothing.  
---
I prepared Veteran Spider, pulled mobs around him, bursted.  
---
I swapped to Chronomancer - took me a sec to realized I can't use axe - i run head first into a wall.  
---
I swapped back to Mirrage, changed stats to pure power, not using clones, just 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.  
---
I prayed to old gods and new, gave money to charity, smiled to female cashier at my local shop.  
---
I'm slowly loosing my mind.  
---
I swapped to power Scourge.  
---
First try.   
---
Done.  
---
Reasuming.  
---
I hate this achivement, and game hates mesmers.  
---
But you should consider using necro. Good luck!
---
Insanely good for chrono.
---
Also decent with FB &amp; Renegade combos (with one of them being healer)
---
Hopefully Anet does an overhaul of traits/weapon skills/utility skills before long to get rid of or merge useless ones and tweak/create ones that make more use of diviners for all classes.
---
Purity of Purpose 
---
...so why didn't you just play those classes instead?
---
If you can *almost* get to a milestone like 100% uptime for a key boon (say, Quickness, Fury, etc) and want to hit that milestone, swapping in a few pieces of Diviner gear makes it possible without going whole hog on concentration.
---
It really feels designed for minmaxing DPS support, rather than building a full suit out of.
---
Holy shit I didn't think that could get cooler
---
2 again.
---
A link to a thread which links to a thread which finally links to [the actual thing](https://github.com/ideka/AugTyr/releases/tag/v0.4-beta)
---
It should be up on Anet's soundcloud (soundcloud.com/arenanet) at some point soon. 
---
/u/maclaine reminder to put the music up there, thank you! :P
---
Maybe the non-driving players can fire weapons while mounted and still be protected by the HP of the mount?
---
Seems like necro is the most common one to get the achievement on. Which is kinda crap. Glad you were able to get it.
---
I’m glad someone else feels me about shoulders. 
---
I like my racing scarf, it’s simple and has nice physics lol.
---
Yes, there's one data centre in the US, and one in EU. You will find much better pings in the EU servers if that's where you're located at now. Keep in mind that your whole account will move if you transfer servers, and you can only move back with a transfer. Also if you move to EU you will no longer be able to play with your NA friends. You can still talk to them and send them things and even party with them, but you wont be on the same maps together. 
---
The cost varies on the population of the server/world and is listed here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Transferring 
---
If you have any interest in WvW, you might want to pick a more populated world (ask around for the general vibe / activity of a world if you're so inclined). If you don't care about WvW, then I'd just go with a lower population world as it will be much cheaper. 
---
i have no idea whats going on in this one, actually.
---
Tbh you can enter air keep you just need a ele inner and outer are very easy to get through
---
I'd be the wrong person to ask, I haven't touched a mac or bootcamp in many years. That being said If this is only for GW2 than I'd say 70-80GB at the very minimum. Windows 10 requires something like 20GB to install through bootcamp and GW2 is roughtly 35-40GB, though the recommended free space is 50GB
---
Necro and warrior as it seems.  
---
Thank you and i hope you'll soon get it too.
---
I’d be into this, it’s an interesting idea at least.
---
Not to mention they can come out with a branded themed outfit if they need a player model. 
---
Which usually only affect specific bosses, not the whole experience.
---
Just let people choose a mode before loading the instance, like with fractal levels.
---
OMG it's the Sheppard Indoctrination theory all over again....
---
Xcept that one kinda made sense in the day + was needed to fill in a completely unsatisfying ending; neither of which are the case in this situation.
---
Gandara is best choice for open zergs? 
---
That's exactly what their power was. It was referenced in the lore about the bloodstone and the last awakening of the dragons. The 5 strongest races of Tyria (Dwarves, Jotun, Forgotten, Seer, Mursaat) had agreed to band together and pour their magic into the bloodstone to protect it from the dragons. But the Mursaat chickened out and betrayed them, retreating into the mists to save themselves leaving the rest to fail spectacularly. This ability to phase out of reality is what made them invisible to most humans which is why the heroes of GW1 needed to ascend and gain "the sight" that allowed them to see them in their true forms.
---
They are expensive but your over stating it here. I'm fairly casual and I managed to craft both these skins.
---
You have any build?
---
The size of the radiant shoulders on the sylvari dude in this comic is actually not that far off from their size on male sylvari in-game.
---
Elaborate please
---
In fractals CMs also have motes. They are kind of like a T5 that only some levels have.
---
It is preferable like that, because you may want to do 3 consecutive bosses in a single wing without leaving the instance, but only the first and 3rd CM, and skip the CM of the second one. Maybe someone doesn't have time, or there's a bug in that CM, or any other reason. 
---
If CMs can be activated before each encounter, players have the freedom to do that. 
---
Oh man... the fellblade is probably my all time favourite weapon from GW1. I was always bummed that it was a GS in GW2 instead of an over sized one handed sword. 
---
I have plenty of wall real estate for this too... 
---
HMMMMMM....
---
As another WoW player it will take a bit to get used to the games mechanics since it is very different from WoW.
---
And remember to explore! You aren’t limited to only quests for leveling. The hearts are there to guide you to event heavy areas and vistas/Hp/herbs also give nice xp. 
---
You're right that I don't play much. As some one who doesn't play it much, I guess I don't want my play time dictated by whether there's a season active right now or not. I'd like to be able to hop on any day of the year and be able to get full rewards. There aren't off seasons for WvW. You can log in any week and be earning pips and achievements. Why can't PvP be like that. If you need a break, just take a break. If you feel you need to try your hardest to get the highest rank you can every season, that's on you.
---
It's not like ANet uses the off season to test out balance changes anymore.
---
Real talk:
---
This is one of the things that drives me crazy about this game. Anet has to have so much control over the content that they will force players to grind (in a "casual game" according to Mike O') and then it will take ridiculous chance, luck, or hours to get those types of products. They mess with the market way too much and it screws players over.
---
It's sad because I had winter's presence almost done until I needed the runes and sigils. Then it became as expensive as a legendary and doesn't even have stats..
---
Makes you want to just cry at all the effort you put into it, and then get blocked by the company that is "anti-grind"..
---
I wish it worked for me. I am using Windowed Fullscreen (and run Taco fine). I watched Wooden Potatoes video. I watched another video posted in November by Tsu Praesumptor. I've googled "augmented tyria" "black screen". I don't use windows 7 so enabling aero is not an option. I tried running it as administrator. Any ideas?
---
Needs more Mirror Blades in face, or 50 stacks of Confusion.
---
Yes, if you are good at your rotation and not cancelling your skills.
---
I guess I don't pay any attention to the leader boards myself.
---
Lol honestly I'm guilty of buying gems to exchange them for gold to buy crafting materials for ascended sets. It's a much deeper hole :(
---
But if there's always a season going, you can try out other game modes any time you like, and come back and PvP any time you like and get full rewards.
---
Its actually very thin on the graph.
---
What were the names?
---
Crafting costs are a shitshow though. Yeah it's roughly consistent from a resource perspective, but when HoT came out ArenaNet made a bunch of nonsense changes to resource reqs on ascended gear.
---
It's not fair that a dual-wield build pays double for weapons.
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.
---
Soulbeast is hard to play because it is completely reliant on burst. However, it is very high in dps benchmarks, and it brings a *lot* to the team.  It's also key to supporting offmeta comps, greatly increasing your team's versatility. 
---
Practice it, and you'll have a very powerful class at your disposal. 
---
&gt; features I mentioned, were actively advertised in trailers and other promotional materials
---
That answered my question on that part, again I would be fine with it if they cancelled content (they always do, most game companies do.) but advertising it then cancelling it is bad. I agree with this.
---
&gt; D3's loot was proven to be rigged again and again. It was pretty much impossible to complete Act 1 on inferno without very rare drops that took months to farm.
---
Me and a friend did this on softcore within 2-3 weeks without touching the AH, sure we we're still teenagers with a lot of time to spend on games, but I disagree fully. 
---
&gt; I'm not even getting into the abundant shady movement of items, which many suspect were listed by the company itself, since none of the top players and communities ever saw them drop.
---
This is pure conspiracy theory stuff.
---
&gt; D3 was also supposed to be a trilogy, from the very early leaks.
---
Just found the article of it being cancelled, that said. I personally don't think they skimped us on content. Like I have said before I don't particularly like the game but I still put several hundreds of hours into it. I was fine with the base product and through patches introducing rifts / GR etc it has just gotten better. So great if they had plans for another expansion, because the content is actually decent and adds enough in terms of value to me.
---
Thanks!
---
The Shining Blade, please! Your art and the animations are perfection. Great work.
---
oh. my. gosh. this is beautiful. this is one of my favorite griffons and you've portrayed them so well. aaaaaahhhhh the little baby ones i just wanna hug them all!! and the berries are such a lovely touch of color to go with their eyes!
---
You need to own Heart of Thorns for a start. Then the easiest way is to start your story. Press H to bring up the Hero menu, click on Story Journal down the left hand side, click on heart of thorns, and begin story. 
---
You'll do a small story segment in the Silverwastes that will take you into HoT. After that point, you can take more characters through bypassing the story and just going through the portal in the corner of the Silverwastes. 
---
The portal thing you mention was for a beta event prior to HoT coming out, so you can safely ignore that :) 
---
If you have the Heart of Thorns expansion, you need to be 1). level 80 and 2). do the first story mission of the expansion.
---
Do you accept payment in bits of string? Because that's about all I have right now. Curse you, poverty!   
---
These are gorgeous though! One of my alltime favourite weapons from GW1. How much do your replicas weigh? It's probably for the best I can't afford this, because I would 100% try to swing it around and that would likely result in serious injuries.  Hope they all find a loving home!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_Maguuma
---
&gt; Getting there
---
The Heart of Thorns expansion is required to access this region. Activate the Heart of Thorns story in your Story Journal in the hero panel, then go to the Silverwastes and talk to the scout at the green star near Red Rock Bastion. Alternatively, if your guild has the Lost Precipice or Gilded Hollow guild hall you can enter your guild hall via the guild panel and then walk through the exit portal. 
---
the portal you are talking about was for the beta test way back. you dont need it anymore. ;)
---
Silverwastes. Bottom left, near Amber.
---
Bubbles expansion confirmed!
---
I bet rytlock smells like rotten eggs all the time then. Alot of charr second names sound really cool (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blood_Legion) and the imperator of a legion better have name thats a cut above the rest in cool factor and fear factor.
---
just look at ash legion, the imperator over there is Malice Swordshadow. Malice: the intention or desire to do evil; ill will. that sounds way more like a villain name to me than bangar ruinbringer.
---
Will you provide the location and pose ideas? Great idea, btw.
---
I don't understand why it's bad for there to be an achievement associated with the collection.  If you don't want to complete it, it existing doesn't compel you to do so, right?
---
Is there a daily character limit on the Chak gerent chests in TD and the grand chests in AB?
---
This is so relatable. Shoulder pads are definitely the most ridiculous armor piece. Finally found a decent pair (druid) for my Charr after only 6 years...
---
Love the comic! 
---
Thank you! Glad you like it! :)
---
The WoW client also gets a giant performance boost installing on windows on the same machine.  It is however more stable overall, the GW2 Mac client crashes on things like using the trading post.
---
I bought a million things through g2a and had no issues, but it's definitely important to be aware of. I'd never buy Xbox live/PS plus time from there, for example, because I know they come down hard on you.
---
But a lot in my steam library is from there.
---
The thing is, they could still force new heroes to go through old LA until they trip the LS1 flag that says LA destroyed/rebuilt, and then after that hero would only ever load into new LA unless replaying old stories.
---
&gt; Maybe let's love on stuff without hating on other stuff?
---
I literally commented on *this* comic about what I like in *this* comic...
---
&gt; Don't have to put something down to prop something else up.
---
...and you're telling me I can't say it under *this* comic because that's "putting down" something else?
---
Well, tough luck: that's how *relative* evaluation works, and *everything* in our experience as humans is absolutely *relative* - to common, regularly occurring things that we tend to perceive as "baseline".
---
For some reason, when Novelties were added to the wardrobe, the backpack on the [Skritt Burglar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Skritt_Burglar_Tonic) got messed up.  The backpack is rotated 90 degrees, clips thru the skritt, and means cage with the cat somehow just sticks to the side.
---
Super cool idea. I'll send you a message later this week. 
---
What resolution do you take your shots in?
---
My big division between the two is that TTGL delivered on it's promises and NGE just didn't. At the climax of TTGL we have the biggest most bombastic robot fight of all time, NGE gave us monologues.
---
They're already made, each looks similar to the one in the site above.
---
- Deployable catapult (you are the payload)
---
- Spider that can traverse walls (so not jumping but actual scaling up and down (and upside down)
---
- shared mount (some giant bantha like creature)
---
- underground drill, lets you bypass enemies (just acts like the toy)
---
- massively prohibitively priced mount one time use that lets you deploy train tracks and sell train tickets.
---
- possess mode that lets you temporarily take control of client side mobs (would be great for puzzles)
---
- crystal wave (aurenes branding) let's you 'ride it' like silver surfer 
---
- kidnapping bag (the bagger from Bloodborne) lets you get in another players sack and get transported.
---
- office chairs
---
- permanent waypoint deployer (5 for entire world, last will replace first, client side)
---
The backpack got rotated 90 degrees, so it clips thru the skritt and the cage just kind of sticks to the side.
---
By complete accident, merely because she was there.
---
Yeah, this seems very likey an error in their database. It's a physical, in-store copy only but it's not actually in stock anywhere. Someone in their system probably made a mistake when entering inventory or something.
---
That one with the sword twirling water with the ocean in the back is very good.
---
Just wanted to highlight it, cool stuff
---
Nice to know that, i'm just not a very good advertiser haha
---
No shame. You're doing your part. :)
---
Part of a fallen god who was stripped of his divinity and had to regain power. Who coincidentally also turned evil for plot convenience and no actually thought out or displayed development.
---
Its not just beating the raid bosses, in WoW need to grind the gear as well as level. So its a big marathon each time a new expansion come out to be 'first'. In Gw2 every time a new raid come out players can just optimize their builds for the new encounter with their horde of free ascended gear in the first hour.
---
Link the hardest Mythic raid and dungeon then. Because when I search for them on youtube the combat and encounter look boring as hell. Gw2 actually has to do more than other trinity mmo games for it to 'feel just as hard' because the combat is gw2 allow for much higher tiered game play for very experienced players.
---
(physics)
---
Even if it is somehow levitated (eg magnetic locking) it still transfers its gravitational attraction through whatever interaction allows it to hover.
---
For instance, hovercraft do their thing by forcing a greater mass of air downward than their own weight. Whatever surface they're floating over still experiences the full force of their weight.
---
Skritt are my favorite &lt;3
---
Thanks for the tip. Mine were already on but it was worth a shot.
---
One person steers the other person can attack with their ranged weapons. 
---
While there has been good additions for armor, some are insanely expensive, like the set from "Star To Guide Us". I don't have 200 gold to dump on sigils. 
---
The best 35 canuck dollars can give you.
---
yeah no thanks. i'd rather not have a whole class of mounts i can't use
---
Largos, the water sylvari
---
It would make sense, plenty of games already do that, doesn't have to be 50%, but around 75-80 would be nice, seeing as you need 2 one handed items, but only one two handed
---
getting carried last season was so urghh \*shudders\* i don't know how else to describe it.
---
For those reporting this for spoilers in the title, stop, there aren't any. 
---
[Bubbles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deep_sea_dragon) is not new to the latest LS episode. 
---
&gt;This is something the devs commented on already. They can't have submerged cave systems that act like pockets of air underwater because the engine has only one water level. Everything below this level will be underwater, everything above is land content. Really sad if you think about all the possible map design that died with this technical restriction.
---
That's not necessarily an end to it, you can achieve a similar effect with trickery. To reference Portal again, think about the portals themselves and their implementation. I've also seen seamless teleportation done in Minecraft with command blocks.
---
That's not to say it would be easy, but it's possible given time and some head scratching.
---
&gt;Yeah true... And the directional keys for left and right would be inverted while hanging from the ceiling. Don't think they can also turn the viewpoint upside down on client side.
---
I would imagine they could, and it would certainly be tech that would be useful in other instances, but also likely a pain in the ass.
---
&gt;But Arena Net is not using it to it's full potential. And they never can build a map around one of these mechanics because not everyone will have the respective expansion or LW episode to unlock it.
---
That is pretty much what I just said. :\
---
&gt;Should the next expansion not introduce new mounts, with similar abilities, we won't see as many things that compliment the mount system anymore.
---
If they leave the system as it is now, I partially agree. A new expansion could feature a new roster of largely duplicate mounts, just more thematic for the new region, and that would be one way of getting around the issue.
---
ANet really need to reconsider and overhaul how they package up and distribute content in the game. Because as it stands right now, the system is a mess.
---
Roll Safe guy meme except it's a Mr. Potato.
---
I like the theory that he has dominion over secrets (to parallel Abaddon) and that people who read anything about him have problems remembering it.
---
Is this the eternal alchemy
---
What would that be?
---
[&amp;BDgCAAA=]
---
Hidden quaggan village you've been talking about :)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjomCMIk4PA
---
Can you imagine the voice actors/actresses saying "We have to fight slebbub". Holy shit that would be amazing, and new players wouldnt understand it at all
---
They may be referring to the title saying that Kralkatorrik isn't dead. That's far fetched, but hey could make sense.
---
Around 24 h mark i think. Or was it the first 1% fail. Not sure. Still for me Tequatl was the best part of Season 1 next to the SAB releases. 
---
Honestly, I feel surprised anyone would see this title as spoiler, considering I tried to make it as ambigous as possible and then even marked the post as a spoiler for people who aren't far into the story so they wouldn't run into important plot points by accident.
---
Yes, basically i can hear it start to “work harder.” Fan (or other parts) spinning faster etc.
---
Same. 
---
I don't know where you are looking mate but 2 Chronos with 2 Pack Runes is easy perma 10 man fury and swiftness on everybody after the initial proc.
---
Logan is one of my favorites cause he isn't a one dimensional caricature. I mean lets look at the rest of the Destiny's edge.   
---
\-Barbarian ranger who is at one with nature
---
\-tormented rogue with a dark past
---
\-Angry soldier who is too old for this shit
---
\-Stuck up genius 
---
and then we have logan who is torn between his loyalty to his friends and his oath to the queen he loves. He makes mistakes because he has the capacity to have conflicting emotions rather than just be there filling a role. 
---
FB craps out allot of low duration quickness true.
---
But to reach full up time you still need quite a bit of boon duration.
---
Some guy recently mentioned having 70 capped characters.
---
I don't know why anyone would do that to themselves. Especially not when the character slots cost money. One of each class I can definitely understand, but wtf.
---
While technically correct ive always found the hero points to literally be the least annoying thing about core tyria completion
---
Maybe we just get to ride Aurene O\_o ..
---
Depends if your group has a chrono or not.
---
If you do then it only really helps as a healer.
---
If you don't and are using FB + Ren then it helps quite a bit to maintain quickness &amp; AEGIS among other things.
---
While your explanation could be correct, by definition, it is wrong.
---
Furthermore, if we were to use your explanation as a basis for it's weight, it would mean the species under the shoulder pads would have higher density than the object...and I think the rest is self-explanatory.
---
So if I were to post a build and want decent input to tweak it, where would I post it, or is there a better community for that?
---
There is also a reference in this episode when in the hallway before the briefing and the last fight, it's listed by a soldier (cannot remember if it's a Pact member or some other faction) as the very last dragon to ditch. Something like "after Kralk we go Primordus and Jormag and then the *unnamed monstrosity lying under the sea*".
---
Haha, Ele was my first class too back at launch, but rerolled before 80 for the same reasons. It's more complex than average and doesn't really feel good till 80 with good gear. Once you're able to start a fast rotation through its attunements, especially with an even faster [Fresh Air](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fresh_Air) build, it gets more fun.
---
Don't delete it, there's a good chance you'll want to explore it later. But probably better to level 1-80 with something more straightforward.
---
If you haven't already done this yet, read/watch the [Combat Mechanics](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers#wiki_combat_mechanics) guides in the new player wiki. GW2 plays differently than most other mmorpgs and those guides will help you understand it all a lot faster than figuring it out on your own.
---
Actually I was thinking of a Kaiju-theme expansion properly entitled **Cantha Rim** where we would pilot giant asuran Golems while mentally linked to some of our allies.
---
Great!
---
I'd give them the benefit of the doubt since season 3. Exempting the finale though I personally enjoyed that episode.

The biggest consistent sink on ascended weapons is the inscription.  While reducing (even rounding down) the remaining costs wouldn't have a *huge* impact, it *would* be nice if the total non-inscription production costs for a one-handed weapon were closer to 50% of the resources required for a two-handed weapon.
---
I personally enjoy doing most achievements because it takes me to new areas of the game and gives me excuses to play in totally opposing playstyles compared to my normal behavior or interests. Nearly all of the achievements in GW2 so far are surprisingly simple and not very grindy at all, which a collection of these weapons would disrupt.
---
I do agree that I feel like I haven't fully completed an area until all of its achievements are done, which for some zones is incredibly frustrating such as Ember Bay or Bitterfrost Frontier with their respective "I'm Rich, You Know." and "Koda's Blessing" achievements. I still have goals I want to complete for my characters outside of achievements, but massive pay sinks like these essentially cease all future progress for my characters, although I still don't mind them. However the distinction here is that it's all liquid gold that can be earned throughout the entire game, while needing something like 16560 Kralkatite Ore would effectively lock my account to the Domain of Istan for months upon months due to both my vicious achievement hunting mentality and the map-exclusive currency. No other achievements so far have asked for such a tremendous amount of work on one specific map (unless you count all of the Precursor collections combined and their requirement of 1000 Bandit Crests each, which I still despise with an undying hatred of).
---
I don't like leaving achievements incomplete because I really love this game. I feel like I owe it to the developers for building such a wonderful experience to actually go out and seek all of the challenges they set down for us. I'm not crazy enough to go after the entire Wardrobe, though that's definitely a higher-end goal, but achievements are basically the next step down. This is why I feel like there should be more caution between just making achievements based on filling out the Wardrobe and having achievements being tasks, quests, or challenges that actually bring you through new experiences. This is a big reason why the Dragonsblood weapons aren't as annoying to me, as you forge a weapon you get further achievements that provide interesting challenges for using the weapon you just crafted, adding content beyond just "unlock 16 skins for the real reward".
---
I'm not sure if any of that helps to see where I'm coming from. Essentially it boils down to feeling that collections for crafting skins seems pointless because we already have a Wardrobe that provides all account unlocks in a numeric fashion, while enjoying achievements that actively seek to change the way you play content in different or exciting ways.
---
Here or the /r/GuildWars2 discord are both good places.
---
youre looking at the "all fractal bosses" section which is not the right one. That one works in a very wonky way (look at raid bosses one. It shows core bs doing 41k or smt 99th percentile but thats just because of the CA logs).
---
When you go to the correct one you will see:

---
I can go on for the 100CM bosses but you can check yourself since theyre the exact same story. all the other classes do about 25%+ of reaper damage making it extremely inferior to them.
---
You do not need more boon duration to maintain quickness, aegis uptime is fine unless ppl get hit if they do duration do not matter. Not much else you do that'd worth losing the dmg you lose.
---
Also, ren can go healing easily so fb+ren can still have a healer.

Scarves are sooooo last year.  The new female human meta is gem aura outfit. c;

Lord Faren as a mount. he is good at everything you know!

Honestly if it is a decent savings, get it.  Copper fed is the best Gem Store item to have when combined with shared slots, the unbreakable tools are a super convenience, and more slots are always good.  If they do the prorating on the copper fed I might get it for another character I have been playing lately.
---
I have winters presence on my ele as part of his 4 elements look and nightfury on my necro (obvious choice lol)
---
one word: quaggans.
---
Picture 4th from the end, female with blue swirl, does anyone know what gear that is?!
---
It most likely didn't target you specifically, it takes something extra special for that to happen. Most 'hacking' is just throwing a wide net and seeing what you get, I imagine.
---
fuck, i wish we had this mordi :(
---
I have tried and tried with WoW but it just never clicked. The lore is interesting and there is something iconic about the art and the feel of it... But I just never enjoyed it. I agree about everyone being on edge. 
---
GW2 has very, very little competition in PvE - it's all opt-in, whereas everyone's fighting for resources in WoW and that's kind of interesting. People will stop to res you *anywhere* in GW2, which is cool. A lot of the open world content requires passive teamwork. The worst I've seen is people "trying to have a philosophical conversation" (by being elitist) and casual homophobia in map chat ("you know most gay people don't like it when you use us as an insult" is an instant shutdown). Oh, and those fartbags who spawn vendors inside chests in Auric Basin. 
---
I like the horizontal progress in GW2. WoW felt like you were always grinding, whereas GW2 rewards variety. Yesterday I did a starter zone completion and some PvP. Today I did my 32-slot bag achievement. I'm tempted to hit WvW for the dailies tomorrow because I never do that. 
---
Anyway, welcome! It's a different sort of game and the openness can be like staring into the void sometimes. Do your dailies. Look at achievements. Cheat and use the wiki. Use the LFG. It's all a valid way of playing. 
---
I died on the 5th panel.
---
P.S. I love everything about this, and the details on those armors is aces.  I hope to see more from you. c:
---
I really just want a condi version of it, for more options. Swap power and ferocity for Condi damage and Expertise, and see what sort of support condi builds arise.
---
[Sure](https://i.imgflip.com/2rb9ib.jpg)

Are you on NA or EU?
---
Fan spinning harder could simply be a setting change due to an update somewhere or change in heat in the room temp. Basically most fans that are on cpu heatsink will be 4pin fans which means their spinning changes the hotter cpu gets. You can adjust this with plenty fan control software (or bios if your mobo allows).
---
Fans will also make more noise overtime because their bearing will get worse and after some thousand hours of usage they'll make really loud noise (which is their life-end) but that takes 4-5 years of use usually.
---
Overall just clean the fan/heatsink and make sure it is mounted properly and check your CPU's temps when it is idle and in use, compare it to what is recommended (google) for your cpu. If your temps are okay and your cpu is working at the speed it should there is no problem. At that point if you want it to be quieter you can get a more silent fan.
---
For the question, heatsink for cpu will be on top of  the cpu socket. It is a big metal piece with some pipes or stuff (depending on model) and a fan will be attached to the heatsink directly not to the case. If liquid cooled, there should be a small piece on the socket with tubes going into another part which will have fans on it to cool the water. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
&gt; minimal rewards.
---
I mean this is still a problem. I would do raids once for the story and never go back since the rewards aren't worth it. I know people hate to hear it but if there is a easier mode the rewards need to be almost on par with normal mode. 
---
Grand chests in **AB** - not limited, free to do it again and again all day long. Instance hopping to multi loot several parallel metas might not work, and for me sometimes bugs the chests for the rest of the day(I used to dc a lot...). Only thing that is limited is the hero's choice chest - once per day per account.
---
I hope they change that ugly druid staff sound soon. Druid is my only solid choice since i love playing support in pve but really that sound haunts me in my nightmares.
---
Honestly we need a set like viper, but one that swaps precision for concentration.
---
GW3 - Kevin Costner’s Waterworld
---
long story short, yes
---
long story, i dont have full numbers because gw2spidy is actually down right now
---
Ok i have one too. I joined pug run, one of them had SC tag and pretended to be dps war. But since his rotation macros didnt work coz boss was moving he raged and left, and i blocked him. The end. 
---
I would love this, it could really amp up support Scourge which has quite a bit of free choice in ability slots to adjust to such a thing.
---
Selbbub\*
---
And yes, I think Selbbub would be the perfect nod to the community. It even sounds just as dragon-esque as Zhaitan or Kralkatorrik, imo.
---
Just post it here, you'll get downvoted but you'll most likely also get the help you want - I guess that's the price you have to pay.
---
I'm sorry to hear that you had an infantile reaction to a post you saw on Reddit. Would you like us to contact a therapist for you?
---
It's Profane Armor Set from the Gemstore
---
Are the effects/color levels/etc shown in the portfolio the effect of photoshop after the fact or do you take screenshots with certain visual mods on the game?
---
NA, sorry i forgot to specify that
---
But he play soulbeast cant upvote that :/. Oh well at least he is not mirage :). Have one from me too .
---
Does condi cleanse from Cleansing Water (Ele, water, grandmaster trait) and trooper runes stack? Do they remove 2 condi or just 1?
---
35 canuck ~~dollars~~ bucks well spent
---
PvP is 100% skill based. You will only be held back by certain gold-gated rune and sigils which are part of your build. A couple matches  of pvp and you can unlock the runes/sigils you want. 
---
You just described Spellbreaker.
---
wow 1:15 is some instant karma shit haha
---
Mirage is pretty much your only option with those requirements.
---
It’s skill/build based.  There are some classes that are just on different tiers than others, and most of them require you to own the expansion to unlock them.
---
BUT, the game mode is entirely skill based, you cannot pay/grind to be better other than having access to the elite specialization.
---
The Deep Sea Dragon is insurance to make sure there is still plot left when we kill all dragons.
---
That said, the devs made it clear they haven't forgotten about it. They gave us Twin Largos in a raid for seemingly no reason other than to remind us that their plotline still exists.
---
As soon as you hit level 2, you can compete in sPvP with the same stats and gear as someone who's played since day 1.
---
WvW has more investment to it (have to reach level 80 and get Exotic gear), but that should be doable within a couple weeks. On the upside, there's no treadmill; level 80 and Exotic will always be sufficient. There is another gear tier, Ascended, but the benefit is marginal and the time investment is high.
---
This is the final boss HoT deserved.
---
&gt; I need to do that stuff on 8 characters per day
---
Why is that, take a break, reconsider your options and choices.
---
The raids imo are too cryptic.   You have no idea what’s going on if you just jump in.  It isn’t like WoW or FFXIV where the mechanics are more normalized and it’s very obvious when to stack vs spread, etcetera.
---
I remember hearing that over 6000 people were involved in wows production at one point
---
i mean, i was giving real world examples.  
---
Granted, this is a magic world, so true anti-grav might be a thing, but by conventional physics whatever force keeps the pads 'levitated' would still transfer their weight onto the thing they're levitating over.
---
So in order to do the much easier Pepperseed achievement, people are being encouraged to start the Forgotten event whenever possible, without announcing it, and without helping. An event that has an achievement for which you're supposed to succeed, to dodge all the things, and to have been there from the moment the event starts. And an event for which the only apparent incentive is the achievement.
---
ANet, no.
---
ANet, why.
---
ANet, stahp.
---
*looks at flair tag*
---
Yeah, reapers are fun.
---
Silliness aside, they're the class I've enjoyed the most, aside from Thief and Mesmer. Their skills have great effects without being overly flashy, it's a slower class with the sword but there is something so very satisfying about diving into a group of enemies and just, destroying them. I used to main Elementalist before HoT came out, but the squishy factor and the fact that it was just an exhausting class to use. I felt like a squirrel on Crack while I was fighting, my friends would hear the rattle of my keys and ask wtf I was doing. Meanwhile they're over there plodding along.
---
Needless to say it was a breaking point. I needed to try something else. Mesmer was okay but I wasn't into it yet, Necro, I kinda liked it, I wasn't sure, but then I hit that Reaper stride and never looked back.
---
Maybe he is a good boy.
---
he woke up, stirred the sea and scared the quaggans. Then Steve saw kraits and karkas as evils so he attack them and they ran away, so now he is just chilling.
---
Or maybe he is a coward dragon?. He felt when zhaitan died so he thinks "Crap, there is something in the mainland who can kill an elder dragon?, better get away", then he felt Mordy bite the dust, "yep, not gonna get anywhere near land, fuk that".
---
&gt; a pretty much free utility slot you can use for support etc (spirits,
---
I play condi soulbeast so not too familiar with power build. If that’s true then I’m disappointed with all the power soulbeasts in my fractal pugs because not one of them ever bring spirit. When I bring spirit, it’s at a huge cost to my personal dps &gt;_&gt;
---
....yes.... *only* $10....

[Here's a quite detailed movie about Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg), currently the only way to experience most of it. Watch it after you've played through all of the personal story of the base game.
---
You can skip buying season two if you can find someone in game that can take you through the episodes in a party.  
---
Season 3 and 4 do not work that way, you need to unlock them on your own account.
---
Yes, there are ''fake'' invasion bubbles. 
---
Someone asked a physics related question, which i gave an answer to :S  
---
I mean, i know it's a fantasy world and all, but it's not as though it has zero correlation with real-world mechanics. In the absence of an in-universe explanation, i'd tend to assume ordinary physics would apply, which means that any floating object must transfer its weight to the surface it levitates above, otherwise you're looking at a much more complicated system where the object must be locked in a fixed position relative to its surroundings somehow, to prevent it either drifting away into space or simply being left behind as the planet it's proximate to continues on its merry way through the cosmos.
---
Is there any PoI in the first map of HoT that is usually hidden? been searching for hours and I cant find it yet. its becoming really infuriating to be quite honest.
---
You can try one of these spellbreaker builds, see how you like them.

Another question, as a returning player who played through the original game, so understands the mechanics and concepts, but hasn't touched HoT / PoT, is there a priority list of what I should focus on? I suppose getting a mount is high up there, but there's probably a lot I'm not aware of :P 
---
The fucking Moon Theme always gets me.
---
Yeah, but in ESO you rarely return to completed areas. I like the upscaling of ESO but it is not the subject.

19,212 in full Ascended Vipers.
---
LS2 probably isn't worth buying unless it's a great deal or you really want to see some story issues.  There weren't any new maps with it (I believe Dry Top and Silver Wastes are in base game).  The LS3 and 4 add a lot in terms of maps and things to do.  Just my 2 cents.
---
A guildie asked me if I was the one that sent this potato.
---
I feel like the fact neither of us was sure until I actually read the message is an indication that maybe I send a few too many potatoes to other players.
---
^(For clarity, it turns out I actually *wasn't* the sender of this particular potato. A+ to whoever did, though)
---
That rant is pretty shit and he isn't objective at all.

Amazing comic. My charr and sylvari are suffering from lack of good looking shoulder bads.

Of course! Don't you?

How is it shit and not objective? He is reading straight of the tool tip and give you the exact numbers and how you can use the skills.
---
Wow. Thats a lot of health coming from traits. Which runes?
---
3. Most dungeons can easily ve cleared with 3 people (exceptions are crucible of eternity path 1, 2 and 3, twilight arbor aetherblade path and citadel of flames path 1, due to mechanics, that require more than 3 players to handle). The only requirement for that is, that you know, how the dungeon works and being practiced in the combat mechanics.
