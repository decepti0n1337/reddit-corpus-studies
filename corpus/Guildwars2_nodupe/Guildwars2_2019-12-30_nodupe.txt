You're failing to see my point. A reaper can also skip nightfall and well of power to just immediately get into shroud and use soul spiral. Im not talking about damage, Im talking about the speed to set up the burst. In my post before, I even addressed the fact dgh can place traps before the boss. Ignoring this, the full burst of dgh takes longer to set up than the full burst of reaper. And yes, Ive played with many good dghs, as a reaper. a common comment is that they dont even get to do any damage by the time Im bursting. I am not commenting on damage. Dgh outranks reaper by far there, again, Im pointing out simply the speed at which reaper is capable of dishing out their burst. If you still dont believe me, then youve either never played with a power reaper, or the ones you have played with have been dog shit horrible.

Thank you for this post!

What i think a lot of people do not understand (also in this thread) is that the 'this game is dead' comments are having a significant negative impact on the player influx. In todays time when you want to invest a lot of time in a online game, you always visit the forum / reddit of the connected community. In gw's case, the reddit has not only a very negative atmosphere about the game, but also a lot of toxix behavior against people who have a genereally positive opinion on the game. All of this "white knights vs. whiny veterans" memewars is really funny to me, but if i were not yet invested into this game, it would 100% put me off and keep me from playing it.
---
Every "should i play this game?" post gets spammed by "game is dead; arenanet hates us" comments, which more often then not actually seem to hold the op off from buying pof or investing more time into gw2. And for no good reason at all. Gw2 is still probably the best value for money game you can get. The raids in this game are great, they just dont offer the right reward structure and replayability. Every single person, and especially every mmo fan, should play gw2 and will have a lot of fun for little money. The insane thing is, that the people who spam thos posts are often frustated people of the raid or spvp communities who complain about a lack of players, while (wrongfully) driving every potential new member of their communities away from the game.
---
I understand those players are ultimately the product of bad business practices by arenanet and ncsoft, but as someone who is reasonably invested in the game, but never was very invested in any forums or reddit, the toxic comments worry me more and make me more sad than the so called "content drought" and bad game updates.
---
I would much rather have elite specs come out as a part of an expac rather than piece meal release in living story.
---
This is going to be counterintuitive to a lot of people on this sub, but actually GW2's only hope is if people spend *more* money on the current content and microtransactions and enough new players join the game to prove to NCSoft that GW2 is profitable enough to warrant enough investment to hire more developers to work on core content such as raids and fractals.
---
If the current content proves to be unprofitable, then the only logical next step from the publisher's perspective is maintenance mode.
---
So you're arguing that they will release no new features over the next year or two? This is it? Where's your basis for that?
---
&gt; If anything they should focus more on stuff outside living world in 2020. they basicly only did open world in 2019 except for 1 raid and the warclaw. 
---
That was one raid and one warclaw too much. If they can convert that effort into open world content in 2020, they will be in a better place.
---
you also forget that PoE is competing with.. what?
---
diablo.. and thats pretty much it.
---
as far as I know and thats why PoE had it so easy there arent a lot.. or even any? other online dungeon crawlers.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GW2 however, especially during its first years had to prove itself against the competition and most noteably WoW. LS1 went okay.. but then.. especially after the content drought before HoT... thats when the honeymoon phase was gone.
---
I'm someone that got in with my then girlfriend, and we played the ever living shit out of the game. As time went on though, We got the first expac, and it was dreadfully different, even challenging. The problem was, it felt hard to do without groups. We were noobs then, so ofc it was hard to kill stuff.   
---
Everything feels so empty right now, and its all so confusing so we stopped.
---
Should be top comment. 
---
We all want this game to be supported. We begged Anet for dungeons when they left then we began to support their new direction. They abandoned the direction as soon as players wanted more. Same for anything else the players want. I regret every dollar I've ever given the gemstore.
---

---
How is the community? Are there guilds taking newbies?
---
1. If you want to play the game, play it
---
2. Avoid reddit at all costs
---
Have you seen "road map" for upcoming 3 months? We will get:
---
Same boring map, with its own currency and collection of lame weapon/armor set. New world boss- Drakkar, that will be on dificulty of pre nerf Triple trouble. I really doubt it will be difficult. Same was told about boneskinner, but it turned out to be too easy. 
---
New story mode, that most people will play once, and never come back. As any other story before.
---
Swiss style tournament, that was promised to get released 2 FUCKING YEARS AGO. At this point not even 99,9% of population will care about.
---
WvW balance, the only thing that will probably be good. But, personaly i dont care about. I am not that much into zerg pvp.
---
We will get more easy content as it now. And if you think we will get anything game changing... Ill sadly tell you... No, we will not get anything good. EAnet will just milk everyone as hard as they can, till it will become clear to everybody, that this game is no more a priority to Anet. Its clear to me now.
---
Yeah, giving a temp account with ONLY access to that camera "hack" would've been 100% fine IMO since I wager they could limit it solely to that, and then they could provide official support and get more involved.
---
How are they going to balance them competitively from people using them in PvE?
---
Dude, I like your optimism! It is akin to someone finding his/her loved one with another person in bed, naked and saying: "It is not cheating, he didn't put it in her yet!"
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What made me lose any hope in ArenaNet was the Icebrood Saga anouncement. That was crushingly disappointing.
---
*Deadeye has entered the chat*
---
reddit is not representative of the 'state of the community'...
---
it's reddit, where people love to bitch about anything and everything, no matter what the subject is - reddit has always been a ~~screaming~~ vocal minority
---
Aye, as far as the "expansion-level" stuff, I'm wiling to hold out a few more episodes at least.  I'm mainly hoping that we get something more than just a couple extensions to the masteries, and ideally some masteries that can be used outside of their specific maps like gliding and mounts.  The one big thing they could do that would make me and a lot of others giddy would be new elite specs, but I will be genuinely surprised if we get those.
---
looking in the general direction of your screen during fractals isn't "ultra clean", it's doing the bare minimum
---
i've always found people like you so hilarious, hiding behind some lame excuse about wanting relaxed runs or whatever instead of simply admitting their inability to improve or even play at an acceptable level
---
Why compare gw1 to gw2 anyway?
---
They‚Äôre totally different in basically every way.
---
In the very least, it's live bug testing...
---
&gt; We have no reason to believe that such features are not on their way, at the appropriate time. 
---
Perhaps no solid and un-arguable evidence, but the new mastery lines raise a lot of red flags. They're pretty much identical to the throwaway "this map only" masteries from the other living world maps that introduced their own masteries. At best, they can add new levels (or an entirely different mastery track) that pretends like the current Icebrood ones don't exist/are completely standalone.
---
I'm still holding out hope that we'll get at least one new mechanic that has a game-wide impact, but the new masteries seem to indicate otherwise.
---
Anet‚Äôs mismanagement lead to NCSoft course correcting
---
&gt; How are they going to balance them competitively from people using them in PvE? 
---
They won't. Remember, these are the same people who unleashed PoF elites into an ongoing ranked season.
---
But more to your point, I agree with you in questioning the value of balancing sPvP/WvW specs based on PvE. It just makes no sense. Everyone suggesting that specs be released piecemeal and be somehow balanced based on PvEs strikes me as players who don't do a whole lot of either competitive mode.
---
Not to be entirely negative though - despite every indication otherwise, I really do hope we get elite specs at some point, I just don't see them coming in pieces though.
---
When I said I unlocked all skills, I meant all skill slots. While I get that GW2 doesn‚Äôt have a hard trinity, it is very off putting to play an mmo without it, as playing Support character has always been important to me in any game that I play. I have played wow but also many other games like ESO, Mabinogi, FFXI and FFXIV, Tabula Rasa, Wildstar, amongst others. You are right, not every game is meant for every player, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt state what displeased me about a game set in an amazing world
---
Also, I had unlocked all the skill slots including my elite skill, and there was only one dungeon. The next one wouldn‚Äôt be for another 15 or so levels. 
---
And you‚Äôre right, GW2 isn‚Äôt the game for me. I want to like it. I really do. The world is so beautiful. The races are all unique compared to other games. I absolutely adore the sylvari and love the charr, but the only taste of group gameplay didn‚Äôt leave me with anything to look forward to.
---
I am not talking about before the boss, I am talking about right before it spawns. You can literally drop all your stuff before skorvald even spawns for example and you will outburst reaper. I play with george who is the power reaper only player in SC and even he says dgh and weaver burst harder. Also, there are no phases where the dmg that reaper does is higher than the one of a dgh even if it would burst faster because phases are almost always long enough to drop traps (with exception of deepstone end boss)
---
I don't think you know what a gear treadmil is.
---
New stat combo is equal to a treadmil now? Especially at that pace? Further new statcombos hardly ever mattered and were never flat out better. Missing defensive stats makes them not better but different.
---
Berserkers is still the best all offensive power stat comb while they just introduced a new all offensive condi stat comb aka viper. It's not really a treadmil when they just introduce stats that make sense for also introduced elite specs. Like they aren't any better they might just fit better to a spec or were missing in general in case of an all offensive condi stat combo. That's not really a treadmil it's introducing missing parts for possible builds.
---
Further there aren't any tanks in fractals. Like it's not even possible to tank...so you can't call that a holy trinity setup either. Neither is a dedicated healer meta. I think it never was at any point it's just more comfortable. The only thing that is meta is bringing max offensive boons everything else is optional.
---
viable means good enough to be played at a reasonable level, as in not meta or super amazing but still workable
---
this doesn't include "any build" ever since some of them can be extremely bad
---
More and more new players are getting in the mobile game market now sadly, which hurts the gaming industry as a whole.
---
I don't think they've managed to get the specs we have now to all be useful. So if it were me I'd prefer a better balance between specs rather than get a new cycle of flavour of the month/year/expansion. Buuut new specs would still be exciting new content even if they'd end up like that.
---
Especs are not comming, deal with it
---
Doubt it. They'll milk players until they cant milk them anymore and then maintenance mode. I wouldnt waste a single ‚Ç¨ on Anet. Destiny 2 on the other hand, in the past they provided quality replayable content so I keep buying expansions, season passes because I know they will deliver.
---
Most of the good talent left anet for quite some time now, for amazon and others who pay them much better.
---
**Do not listen to the reddit community as a whole, they are bitter and full of people who no longer play but bash the game anyways**.
---
There has been "doom and gloom" posts about GW2 being shut down since 2013. And these kinds of posts have increased drastically since the large disappointment that was the PAX announcement this year, but in all honesty, the releases have **improved** since ArenaNet began recovering from the forced layoffs in early 2019.
---
They're not perfect, but they're not bad either. Worst thing to happen this year was the ridiculous prices of "build templates" (actually build loadouts) which is, in all honesty, a result of the community shooting themselves in the foot for saying for years that they would pay for build templates.
---
The game is still going, with bimonthly content plans that easily reach the entirety of 2020. And for new players, it's effectively monthly content since there's bimonthly festivals that occur.
---
Even if GW2 were to go into maintenance mode like so many like to claim it already is (it isn't), you'll still have a good year or two's worth of gameplay, with a few months' worth of gameplay from just the F2P content.
---
The biggest question you should ask is not "is GW2 still worth playing" but "is GW2 worth playing for the type of player I am". If you're a person who enjoys little more than high-end group content, or if you're into pure PvP stuff, then GW2 may not be for you. The game is geared towards casual solo gameplay with an active community that comes and go.
---
While there is high-end group content, and there are PvP modes, they don't get nearly as much attention as the open world and main story that are geared towards solo gameplay do.
---
My suggestion: since you started, keep at it. Get to level 80, and see if you like it. The gameplay and story does get better the further you go, too.
---
Yeah, I mean who the fuck is going to take Utility Goggles over something more useful in a group comp..
---
The thing is, in GW2 you dont really vote. If each game mode offered something players could buy with gems, lets say a new map/piece of content. Then we'd know what people desire the most. Since atm you can buy only skins that do not effect gameplay it's mostly throwing cash at Anet for eye candy.
---
Right now they can either somehow monitor what players play or just make "educated" guesses. In first case by not producing more content for certain game-modes they drive the players away - whats been happening for the last few years.
---
Then we could provide proper feedback and know it was being seen, such as asking why ANet management thinks doing exactly the same thing that got a third of their studio laid off was the best move right after promising to refocus on GW2.
---
Communication doesn't just mean "ANet dumps info" - it means they see and respond to the concerns and criticism from the actual human beings who play their game. That back-and-forth can't happen until ANet tells us future plans - ANet's refusal to respond to things means the community never knows they were heard in the first place, and so the issues fester in the community rather than reach some actual resolution.
---
Narrator: It will be good for healing.
---
&gt;Game has been in maintenance mode for nearly 3 years now and all they add are story.
---
Ah, yes, Guild Wars 2 is the Game Paradox. Where it is in maintenance mode, and yet not in maintenance mode.
---
It's called Schroddiner's Game.
---
What separates useful, if negative, feedback from 'bitching' in your eyes?
---
Agree with your second point but the beetle and skyscale were released before the icebrood saga. And what is being questioned here is:
---
&gt;Anet's promised Expansion-level content **in** the "Saga"
---
Also, when players refer to mounts as expansion level content they are talking about the mechanic itself that was introduced with PoF, not diferent kinds of mounts, just like HoT introduced gliding. So far, it remains to be seen if the icebrood saga will bring a new mechanic like PoF and HoT did, though I wouldn't keep my hopes up.
---
I was another "playing since GW1 beta" player, but I just don't bother to log in at all anymore. I am/was a guild leader in what was one of the largest PvE guilds on my server, and I even met my wife through GW2, so the game has a special place for me... but it's just not a game that's made for me anymore. Even my wife only logs in once in a while to say hi to guildies or to grab whatever the current holiday rewards are. 
---
I would say the situation is salvageable, but I don't have any faith that the current management in ArenaNet will be able to turn the ship around. Even if they were to announce GW3 tomorrow with a new engine and every bullet point on the collective subreddit's wishlist addressed... it'd still be the same management in place that got GW2 to where it is now, and they aren't going anywhere until the company shutters.
---
It is. I believe that was how ANet got their funding for making it.
---
I do it by looking at the chat box and seeing someone say, "Need help with Temple of Melandru chain."
---
And then I go, "You have my ax!" and join up.
---
Now that's open world and the requirements are that you can play without peeing on your own shoes. It gets me all the social I crave without me needing to conform to a restrictive set of build, gear, and role requirements.
---
That's me. You seem to want to do the hardcore stuff. Your play time is a problem for sure, but /u/NarutoFan420 got you covered for the best way to find a guild in your situation, IMO. Just keep at it until you find some good-to-go guildies and you'll be at each other's throats when you wipe in no time!
---
That user is correct.
---
Real talk: Necro really needs a long-range condi weapon. Staff on necro is not only the most boring weapon in the game, it's also very situational and very inconsistent (the autoattack is power damage exclusively, and despite having the same firerate as revenant hammer's autoattack, only activates projectile combos 20% of the time). Scepter is truly condi but decidedly mid-ranged.
---
IMO, a longbow or rifle condi elite spec would fill a currently under-served part of necro's toolset, and while I would prefer rifle to give that weapon some more use, longbow would also serve to give necro a 1200+ range weapon that isn't... necro staff.
---
Anet has been mismanaged by its own senior staff for years at this point. Nearly a decade. Ncsoft is not the reason why they made a series of bad decisions that pigeon holed them into making more worse decisions later on. Ncsoft is not the reason why anet lack any kind of a conclusive, coherent vision on which they could base GW2 development. Ncsoft is not the reason why anet moved to developing new product at the expense of their only commercially viable game 6 months after its release, in an unhealthy an unsustainable manner. Ncsoft is not the reason why anet have the corporate culture that they have, which also contributes to their poor success. Ncsoft is not the reason why instead of hiring competent specialists anet are hiring for diversity.   
---
Anet are the only one who have dug this hole years ago and kept digging themselves in for a decade when there were dozens of points where they could have chosen a different path forward as a company. But they didn't.
---
Damn, y'all getting paranoic. No sane person end a message in :). After reading this reply I decided that white knight atleast are human beings.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 is one of the most ambitious MMOs ever created though
---
One of the most ambitious MMOs ever hyped you mean. Even the original implementation in 2012 had **nothing** in common with their grand PR designs like their infamous "MMO manifesto", and all further development for the game took it even farther away from those lofty goals (or, more likely, lofty PR lies - there is scarce evidence of the game ever being truly developed in that direction) and towards the regular template of themepark MMOs.
---
I did watch the videos a bit, but don't see skills being cast on the ground next or behind the character. Is it like GW2's action camera?
---
&gt;If the Christmas card project was somebody's "baby", and I think it's  safe to say it was, then it makes sense that the project died with them.  It's not like no cards went out at all, but the person who cared about  making this awesome is likely gone.
---
I'm not sure I agree. To me, at least, here's a world of difference between the two types of card. However, I do think that that in itself isn't anything particularly worrisome. It might be an indication of something or it might not be. Personally I'd very much like a sign that things are okay over at ArenaNet, though. Especially given recent developments. Buuut I'm digressing.
---
You can also raid with 25 paladins in WOW. It's more fun but requires people to be good and it's harder, probably impossible, to pug.   
---
Remind me again, where the supposed "MMO revolution" is in this regard? The revolutionary MMO copy-pasting the most typical implementation of raiding much in the vein of the types of content Everquest had in 1999 is anything but "revolutionary".
---
They are developing their new game. I guess NCSoft figured Gw2 could not be "revived" so they gave green light to Anet to work on another game I guess .. the layoff were simply cost measures .. too many ppl for so little revenue the game was having.
---
&gt;City of heroes/villains was killed because it ‚Äúno longer fit the image of what NCsoft wanted‚Äù. 
---
They killed CoH because at the time they got a tax break from the Korean government for it. That particular bit of corporate welfare has been removed by the Moon administration and thus you won't be seeing the same thing happen with GW2.
---
&gt;I see a lot of negativity thrown at ArenaNet.
---
Tunnel-visioned hardcore players trying to convince anyone that listens that tailoring the game to them is a guaranteed license to print money despite all the evidence to the contrary. Ignore it.
---
pfff ok boomer :)
---
I have been reading this and have done some deliberation and I like all of them, which is good because I dislike a lot of the order agents presented in the various races' introduction to them.
---
But if forced to make a choice I would not pick Tybalt. He'd come last, actually. I think I like Forgal the most (I really liked seeing him in the battle with Mordremoth), but it's close.
---
Good luck Chris.
---
*it's totally normal for devs to move on*
---
&gt; The reality is there isn't a long-term, big picture plan.
---
I see people are finally starting to catch up on this point. I won't lie, I had high hopes for the game back in 2012 and even during the first season, not necessarily because the game was great and what they were doing was even greater, but because it was *unique* (not really, strictly speaking, but unique among games still popular in 2012) in its approach. There was a clear vision, even if the implementation was sometimes messy.   
---
But then after the first year of LS the direction of the game suddenly changed, and LS2 was based on entirely different ideas. Then that was also scrapped and we got HOT which was good but it was also entirely disconnected from all of their lofty PR speak during release and from the first years of post-release content. Then we got LS3 which was also going into a different direction. Let's not even bring up POF and how it changed the entire game's pitch yet again, now in favor of casual content and pointless time sinks based on intentionally frustrating mechanics.  
---
The game has been a rudderless ship for nearly its entire life, going wherever the wind blows at any given point.
---
[I made my peace with the game about six months ago.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cblqff/its_been_fun_but_as_a_vet_i_feel_that_the_game_is/) I continued to play for a little while, but I wasn't excited about playing the game or the future of the game itself.  It was time to move on, and I didn't have the luxury of pulling punches.  I said what was on my mind then and divested of the crux of my relationship with the game.  I'd be happy to see it do well, but I'm done with it. 
---
Yesterday I logged into the game for the first time in a while.  I ran around Twinspur Haven in early Wayfarer Hills in a fit of nostalgia for the Shiverpeaks.  I realized that I get a similar feeling from the [EoTN character-select in GW1 with far less effort.  I don't have to login the game and I can stare at the hearth for a bit.](https://binged.it/2MEJrbU) 
---
I don't get nearly the same sense of adventure from GW2 anymore.  I think that reason alone is enough to move on to new experiences and adventures.  Whether that's IRL or in other games like the Witcher or Path of Exile.  Whether that's volunteering or heading back to school in Summer 2020.  
---
I don't think that you're incorrect about the game being a self-fulfilling prophecy, but at the same time, ArenaNet really haven't done anything to return calls to their veteran communities? The ball is in their court and has been for a while, but all they seem to really want to do is throw free-throws and cash in on the casual community. 
---
My general sense of GW2 is that the ArenaNet from 2015 &amp; 2017 isn't the ArenaNet of 2019.  They lost a lot people to the lay-offs like Josh Foreman or Benjamin Arnold (Chillstep Coder) amongst countless others and it isn't really the "same" company anymore; it's the same place, but with less personality, character and heart.
---
Another senior staff member. :(
---
 &gt; Living world drops and funneling all rewards through cash shop 
---
literally my biggest issue with this game since its introduction. Why should I do raids, fractals, dungeons, ect when the cool skins are locked behind my wallet?
---
I dont mind some stuff in cash shop but not everything. Why cant I do X activity under X,Y,Z challenges that require a group effort and get some cool skin or mount?
---
Which is sad and ridiculous when you have people from daoc designing it.
---
... and skills 2-5 doesn't always works depending on the implementation details the enemy
---
Id rather have elite spec in the worst possible way than no elite spec in the best possible way. 
---
The saga isnt helping me want to play more. 
---
Elite spec would.
---
Yeah that's a pretty good way to put it.
---
Honestly I wouldn't trust current anet to design elite specs.
---
As much as I'd like to see new content like that, I don't think their pvp and wvw scene could endure another year of "balancing" their overtuned ideas.
---
The saddest part about the past two living world updates is that they're becoming so small with hardly any content when they promised expansion level content. I  am very disappointed. Don't get me wrong there are still a few fun features but it's just not enough to sustain interest for longer than a day or two. 
---
I can't remember the last time I logged in.
---
Another big name to go...best wishes in your future Chris, and thank you for the past 7 years!
---
LoL no I can't be bothered playing content, that is 6 years old and should be farmstatus by now, properly every day for months and years on end.
---
You take about an hour with Heal and Support to clear those fractals anyways, and you can pug that shit whenever **you** want to run fractals not only with your premades.
---
 I can't be sure that those guys I have in my team actually have exp or not; I'm selling my killproofs from 100cm because I allready have the Infusion and keep faking them with GW2chatcodebuddy so I guess others do the same.
---
Running a proper fucking Alacrigade as well as a Healbrand guarantees me that I can carry my DDs through the dungeon! If you dodge thats fine, but we both know that actual skill cannot be required in this community crowded with lazy people that show up for raids in greens and blues, barely know their rotation or their class in general.
---
Running fractals with Healer and Support (real Support not Shiro Renegade ffs) ensures that you can carry those fuckhead facetanking DDs that can't or won't dodge at all, those guys that stand in fire and refuse to move out of it - all those shitlers you get in random pugs - you can carry with your defense and heals.
---
Also yes, for that matter redundancy is great - having Jalis Stonestreet as well as Healbrand Ulti Mantra increases the odds that your teammates survive!
---
If I run with premades and buddys I know we sure can go 5x dps and maybe play clean but its still better not to, imo farmcontent should be fun; you bring classes you never played before and test them in real encounters instead of at the golem! I prefer testing new alts of mine in fractals and just do normal CMs + T4s; -- or if I have a new Armorset like Medium Viper for core Engineer or Condi Thief. Just bring that shit into CMs and dupe around.
---
I'm doing this, playing shit I never played before and therefore I am expecting others to do the same.
---
You can't rely on killproofs; you need to look at their Infusions - Titles - Armor etc. to confirm their experience.
---
Also I really can't be bothered to play the same farmcontent that is 6 years old and be mentally active doing it for the n-th time, so YouTube / Netflix and chill it is.
---
Fractals are a meme, Wing 7 was a meme too - this game needs content fast! We need something to acutally be forced to play properly! I'm not running fractals without a proper Healer anymore, its just too laidback and relaxed - you can facetank mechanics just as all those other fuckers around you do all the time; you can relax and clear the "hardest" fractal content there is with ease.
---
I guess you're just tilted that newbies today can clear CMs so fcking easy because nowadays real healers and supports exist.
---
Chris was cool. 
---
Anet is fucking doomed. And they deserve it.
---
it hasn't even been a full year since the massive layoffs. They've lost nearly all of their original team at this point. 
---
Pretending people shouldn't be worried because "well they are hiring NOW" is a bit disingenuous to the past year of ANET disaster.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; Real talk: Necro really needs a long-range condi weapon.
---
Or at least something that can counter rifle deadeye that spams immob at max range and you can't do anything..
---
/s
---
Half true: GW2 is catered to people who don't no-life their games and are content putting a little bit of time in, when and where and how they can. Show me another MMO that asked me to pay $30 two and a half years ago, and is still delivering content to me today, while the personally-offended rail in the comments section of threads.

If you're looking for a game where people hard-dedicate their time, go play a game that asks you to pay $200 a year just for access to your character. You can moan about the squandered difficulty in the game, but the fact is, times have changed, and most people don't have time for MMOs anymore, and several of those don't want to bother with content that demands they Git Gud or whatever.
---
If Guild Wars 2 is a game that is "tragically wasted with auto-clicker difficulty", Then That's Fine, because perhaps this game is not meant for every player. If you want more, there's games that do that. This is the foundation of every "if you don't like it you can leave" argument.
---
Thank you kindly for you honest opinion.

does it come with the  [**Living World: The Icebrood Saga**](https://buy.guildwars2.com/store/gw2/en_US/html/pbPage.pathoffire/themeID.4785548100#standard5) ?

---
Nothing "comes with" the living world Icebrood saga. If you're logged in when it's live it unlocks, like every other living story. In other words there is zero difference buying the game from dlgamer or Anet. It's the same game that unlocks the same stuff.
---
It comes with the current episode.. you have to buy the previous ones.. however since you've been playing on free to play.. you probably already have them unlocked (depending on the last time you logged in), but can't play them until you get PoF/HoT.
---
okay thanks. A little unaware what Living World: The Icebrood Saga was
---
I know it is not a Sloth, but I just found this funny because it looks like the Sloth backpack.  
---
For reference: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sloth_Backpack
---
To reiterate: this game has been free for people for nigh on two years. This game is making money off the cash shop, to bring all this content, that everybody moans about, to you, for $0.90 a month, one-time payment.
---
World of Warcraft can afford to throw legendary-tier drops into the actual drop tables in the game, because if they put it all in a cash shop, the players would riot. Who would pay $15-20/month just to be told you have to pay again, just to look good? If you spend more than one month trying to get something in World of Warcraft, let's face it, you paid $15-20 for that item. The same price as a deluxe mount skin in Guild Wars 2, which is... optional.
---
Legendary PVE armor is something I'm less familiar with, and fair enough, if it's broken, needs to be fixed. That much isn't really negotiable. But moaning that there's better-looking paid cosmetics than items it takes you months to get by playing means you either pay to support the game, or you acknowledge that you basically paid next to nothing for those raid wings that you're farming to get said armor from.
---
But the casual player doesn't give a flying fuck about raids because the casual player plays casually.
---
People that care about anything being gated behind raids aren't really "casual".
---
You necros give up your souls for anything
---
Just LOL @anyone who is still doubting the sinking ship.
---
ofc it's Human female meta too
---
oh shit. gw2 is officially dying
---
I play both a minstrel firebrand and a minstrel scrapper.
---
They both have a straightforward rotation with protection, cleanses, and heals.
---
They differ in that the scrapper adds super speed and smoke fields, and the firebrand adds stability.
---
As for which to play, I suggest you ask your guild which they need more. That way you‚Äôll fit in with the guild comp better.
---
If you run with pick up groups, I would choose neither. I‚Äôd stick with a damage class with high mobility and survivability.
---
PUG groups don‚Äôt stay on tag enough to get the benefit of a minstrel healer/support class.
---
FFXIV. the game went from a FO76 level of a disaster to a game that have surpass wow for some people as their number 1 mmo. and yes it taken them a while to get back the trust of the players but now the only big drama the game have is a buttnerf.
---
ESO also improve themselves since their bad release.

[Let's not forget this is Chris scoop-up-your-info-spyware-style Cleary.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/gaming/guild-wars-2-monitored-all-running-process-in-order-to-ban-users/) Who took steps to *intentionally ignore* the community. He has had a direct role with all the rampant botting and false positives over the last 8 years.. Out of all the employees that have left the company over the last year or so, his departure matters the least if at all. Quite frankly replacing Chris ages ago would have been good for the game.

would like the option to make my own choice on this
---
Well, being that he comes from a game that means not much in the current MMO market, no wonder why PWI would hire him over, say, Blizzard or SE.
---
I mean, day after day of the exact same point worded slightly differently at some point is no longer useful, no matter how constructive it may have been the first time it was posted.
---
There are not new exciting things on the horizon. If you go into the next 12 months expecting something different from the prior 12 months, you will be disappointed.
---
The recent roadmap post was clear communication. Expect small changes. Do not expect large changes or improvements. GW2 is a 7 year old game and the -quarterly- plan for WvW is a skill balance patch and warclaw balance.
---
I used to play this game casually (as I didn't have too much time on my hands to play), but even as a casual player, I enjoyed the more difficult content such as raids, CM Fractals, WvW etc. Even from a casual standpoint, all of the old content starts to become stale, and when gamemodes like WvW aren't taken care of, they become less enjoyable. I have no desire to login to this game these days as it's lost my interest.
---
&gt; What I thought might happen is instead of a new elite spec for each class, a new elite trait line would unlock for all classes as part of a campaign.
---
That was not a reasonable expectation.
---
There is a community problem of people speculating baselessly about what ANet will deliver.
---
ANet has rarely overdelivered.
---
A writeup like this could get a lot of the devs attention if it was posted on the forums as well as on reddit.
---
But the point is, regardless of how many people are doing the maps, practically nobody is doing raids, so they are irrelevant.
---
I made a statement on this many months ago on the forum and got a warning for conspiracy theory.  I said before that the developers were making another game that isnt a MMORPG like many people are assuming the GW3 was.
---
Insert "Everything's fine" meme.  
---
Founder's gone, GW2 sequel gone, all these major employees gone in a span of a few months due to firings or resignations. Who's left?
---
&gt; Perhaps no solid and un-arguable evidence, but the new mastery lines raise a lot of red flags. They're pretty much identical to the throwaway "this map only" masteries from the other living world maps that introduced their own masteries.
---
Possibly. We'll have to see how they play out with later content. Right at the moment, they're kinda lame, but there is room for improvement, and HoT had plenty of stinkers too.
---
You are right, but this api is very powerfull tool for those who have some free ram space and cpu power :)
---
Once you have a full account you can buy anything from the gemstore with gold too, so if money is an issue you can grind in-game gold to unlock any missed living world episodes
---
&gt; Same boring map, with its own currency and collection of lame weapon/armor set. New world boss- Drakkar, that will be on dificulty of pre nerf Triple trouble. I really doubt it will be difficult. Same was told about boneskinner, but it turned out to be too easy. 
---
I hope it's not that hard, Triple Trouble is a PitA. 
---
&gt;New story mode, that most people will play once, and never come back. As any other story before.
---
Yeah, this is working as intended. I don't see a problem with that. 
---
&gt;Swiss style tournament, that was promised to get released 2 FUCKING YEARS AGO. At this point not even 99,9% of population will care about.
---
Yes, this annoys me, they should not be wasting any time on something like this, but hopefully it's just like one or two devs in their free time or something, like SAB.
---
&gt;WvW balance, the only thing that will probably be good. But, personaly i dont care about. I am not that much into zerg pvp.
---
Same, this should not be a priority.
---
&gt;We will get more easy content as it now. And if you think we will get anything game changing... Ill sadly tell you... No, we will not get anything good. EAnet will just milk everyone as hard as they can, till it will become clear to everybody, that this game is no more a priority to Anet. Its clear to me now.
---
We still don't know what the new map content will contain, or what new abilities they'll unlock. Even the "next three months" will only be a a quarter or less of the Icebrood Saga, so they have plenty of time to make good on their larger scale promise of being "expansion worthy."
---
Yeah people dont realise the flak devs or community managers get. I think it was Apex Legends community manager that treated redditors as they treated him, they roasted him, dragged his name through the mud. Then they slowed down on any type of interactions. Surprised to no one. Doomed if you do, doomed if you don't, as the loud minority ruins it for a lot of people.
---
They'd probably release the first 30 skill points towards each specialisation in the first episode, then incrementally build from there. Or release one class's specialisation at a time and then cancel the whole thing before they get to ele.
---
And you get a downvote for complaining about downvoting. Also for being pretentious.
---
Why I quit the game not long after Pof.
---
I log in every once in a while to poke at story but usually leave before getting anything done. I'm not part of the target audience anymore and the only hook left is nostalgia for what was lost.
---
Really not true at all in WvW. The real advice should is to suck it up and have zerk for pve and some kind of mix for WvW.
---
At one time the Druid was a good support healer. Too good, so they nerfed it again and again just to be sure. Can't have players enjoying a role.
---
Agreed. Years of living world is starting to get a little boring.
---
So far the elite specs released aren't all that daring and questionable inventive either. Really a greatsword on necro was the first and only time they've done an interesting weapon set.
---
Sniper on thief? Meh
---
Longbow on guardian? Hopeful but BORING
---
Sword on weaver is probably the only other thing that was an interesting choice
---
I wanna see stuff like a longbow on elementalist for interesting elemental arrows (it'll be like a fast paced staff of sorts?) or a melee staff on warrior as a sorta slow paced daredevil? Maybe thief could get greatsword. These are just examples. Do the INTERESTING weapons first, then follow up with the sorta more boring ones like warhorn and sword
---
The longbow (please not shortbow. That can go to mesmer. Elementalist needs a great long range option and staff is not a great option) elementalist could be called something like Arcane Archer, the warrior could be a monk (yes I know they were in gw1 but this isn't that anymore), thief could be a Scoundrel or maybe something like a Thug.
---
Entire PC crashes are not a gw2 issue.  The game has been incredibly stable for many people and many months.  It uses the CPU heavily.  I'd check the CPU cooling and leave the vid card alone.  As mention power supply could be an issue, but that is  usually fatal for the power supply.  
---
Try a burn-in CPU/video test.
---
Repairing the client rarely does anything helpful except kill a day.
---
System crashes will NEVER been in a log, except for the restart afterwards.
---
I uninstalled for that reason exactly. The problem if I leave it installed is I just want to log in and do dailies, and then end up doing some WvW, and then oh look at the time it's midnight. Skinner box indeed.
---
After 3k+ hours there is not much new to see. Just grind.
---
Oh idk. Just assuming I guess.. Considering that only games Anet has ever released has been MMOs.
---
Banks are forgiving like that
---
Honestly? We don't know what goes on behind closed doors.
---
[This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) has a nice list of build websites and what they are good at.
---
About what qualifies as a good/ok/meta build I would say it really depends on the game mode and the situation in the game mode (Unranked PvP, Ranked PvP, Chill raids, new to raids, Just T4 fractals, doing fractals CMs, WvW zerg, WvW roaming, mostly solo  play in Open World, world bosses/meta-event, etc, etc). Some people on here can give some additional details if you want our opinion on the efficiency of a build in a specific situation.
---
For Legendary weapons you can checkout the [Legendary Collections on the Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Weapons_(achievements\)) and als [Gw2Efficiency Crafting Calculator](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries).
---
Doing HoT meta is usually interesting everyday (except DS because it's a bit long ^^) and a rather fast way to get some map key, currency, map specific material (Chak Egg, Aurilium Ingot, etc) and Amalgamated Gemstones (which are always useful). If you can try to craft yourself some reserve of the daily cap crafting material to make T7 like the [Spool of Thick Elonian Cord](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spool_of_Thick_Elonian_Cord). If you plan in a semi-near future to get a legendary armor through PvE raids or legendary runes/sigils I would highly suggest (even if it's better now) you start getting some [Provisioner Tokens](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Provisioner_Token) because even if you don't see the immediate need/benefit it's worth it to not have to wait to complete your armor because you need a few more days of Tokens. It can also allow you to get enough tokens for way cheaper if you select the right exchange.
---
Wont get much cheaper than $20 for everything.
---
better let pvp and wvw die without any interesting content
---
and no, alliances and swiss tournament wont make anything better
---
i like how people downvote you fpr the truth. imho CC should be fired after that banwave that went horribly wrong
---
ofc you are not, you are the average in this subreddit: a casual who is pleased with anything anet releases
---
It‚Äôs sad to think back to ~3 years ago when I first started browsing this sub, back before I even had a Reddit account. I noticed that this community was WAY more supportive and passionate about their game than most other MMOs.
---
It‚Äôs rough to see that enthusiasm die out and be replaced with disappointment and dissatisfaction with Anet‚Äôs aggravating management. They HAD one hell of a community, and they totally blew them off it seems.
---
maintenance mode  ;)
---
There will probably be some eventually, they just wouldn't make much sense at this point in the plot.
---
Totally GW1 flashback. Even with community team with the original dev backup there still some OP build left.
---
IMO firebrand healer is better because it's easier to carry disorganized pugs with it, while scrapper needs a bit more coordination. For example, stealth gyro needs your people to not run ahead like idiots. Also FB controls the flow of stab and stunbreaks. For example, with Mantra of Liberation, you can free your party from a bubble or bomb because of the group stunbreak. You can also quickly save people with Merciful Intervention while the function gyro is.... questionable. This also makes it much easier for you to personally survive. Also the masses of reflects on demand is just useful in any situation, really. In non-blobby fights, the blocks can also be useful. Sure in an average fight, you may think the aegis isn't going to block much, but a single hit could be like 4-5k damage easy on your squisher friends, plus you can trait to make it heal on aegis removal too. 
---
Scrapper is still a solid choice in an established group though, and brings incredible utility as a good stealth push can easily allow you to win fights. The condi clear is second to none with purity of purpose which effectively makes your whole group immune to condis. Actually not just immune to condis-- condis actually help you because you turn them into boons. I find it funny when enemies pull chilling fog because that's just free resistance for everyone. Oh, and don't be like me and kill yourself with Bulwark Gyro as it shares damage so if you cast it randomly you're eating a whole group's worth of damage which can get ugly fast.
---
The tl;dr is if you intend to just  pug, firebrand is generally better since chances are you have less firebrands than needed.  If you do intend on investing more into wvw and are willing to get in coms with server or guild, then perhaps they have the FBs cover and you can do scrapper. But all and all, I'd recommend Firebrand because they are just in high demand.
---
Thanks a lot, there is so much to this game haha.
---
Best Challenge ever xd  
---
I still have the mail of chris in my inbox

~~Chris wasn't security lead in 2018~~
---
Kinda? The problem is this will also probably result in nerfs to current elite specs. Mostly because you want people to get new OP things (that will get tuned down later) instead of ignoring them as being underpowered niche things unworthy of raid or fractal. Odds of them _just_ being "different weapon" are kinda small though, no?
---
The only way to grab Anet's attention is hurting their revenue. This means stop giving them money. I believe 5% of the overall community is here in reddit reading this, let's say 3% of it will go for it and stop buying gems but that number doesn't represent a huge loss for a company like Anet. I would say you need at least 25% of the overall community to stop spending money on game to actually grab their attention. If you really want to go for it the community needs to do more than a reddit post. Organization is key.

Why are you even here? Go back to black desert

I think theyre going to milk GW2 as long as possible, so I kinda doubt they will release something to replace GW2. Maybe they do some android game or whatever. GW2 is still making money, less than before, but still.
---
That's easy! Useful feedback is feedback that was requested by a person or organization with the means and opportunity to act on the feedback.
---
A comment on an ANet thread asking for feedback or an ANet CEO or GW2 game director AMA would be useful feedback.
---
Apart from that, it ain't useful because nobody asked and nobody is listening.
---
Additionally, ANet has a bad track record of listening in cases where they did ask for feedback.
---
Do you stalk every dev on twitter or how do you guys find this out so quickly?
---
https://ayende.com/blog/Images/Windows-Live-Writer/Career-planning_A664/image_2.png
---
I dont think we've ever had a period where players were trully happy with the state of the game but  we will still look back at what we used to have and miss those times. Yes se3 wasnt that great ow wise, episodes took relatively too long to come out for their content, yet i look back at those times and i miss them because for me se3 was the period of fractals, we got so many changes, additions, rewards and just new content in general that it balanced out the lack of lw content or the lack of raid content for me.
---
Similarly i remember hot and early post hot how i enjoyed the game because hot was the mmo expansion and it was the time where i made a bunch of friends in the game and ran content with them all the time.
---
yeah im not playing this game anymore until they release new elite specs, they fucked up one too many times. I love the game but they way it's been treated i won't be surprised if it dies
---
I remember going to the official forums in **2013** and seeing a very well received thread with a whole list of QoL improvements/fixes that I mostly remember being very good ideas that would benefit anyone. That thread has been totally ignored and I don't think we saw even 10% of its suggestions put into the game in the 6 years since.
---
I have to think of that thread every time I stand in front of the TP but can't use F to talk to him because some useless ambient NPC is taking up the focus. Fixing that was one of the higher up items of that list.
---
The point being: If Arenanet can't even be bothered to fix these small annoyances of everyday life that would make everyone's life easier, there is no reason to expect them to listen about the big issues either.
---
Hi everyone!
---
I'm at level 80 for a while now, and I taking things very slowly. Mainly because I'm a fresh father, and don't have the energy to go full force. I find GW2 a chilling experience after a long day. I enjoy doing all Hearts quests and diving into each zone Lore. I actually plan to do all classic zones before moving into HoT zones (I'm around 50% now).
---
However, once in a while I want to take a break from zones, and I figure some gear grinding will be a nice alternative. I want HoT to be a challenge, but I'm assuming the game also scales on HoT zones? so if I'll get Exotic gear - I'm still not going to sweep over HoT content easily.
---
I'm running a Ranger right now, so I'm assuming a Berserker Exotic gear is what I want to get for Beastmaster.  I have around 150G I was able to grind during Halloween/Wintersday, and my current gear is a mix of Exotic/Yellow gear I got during the events. 
---
Where should I start? Should I grind a specific gear type first? should I used my gold for that? or better save the gold for Ascended gear later on and I should instead grind the stuff from Berserker? Is there any guide somewhere to point me into the right direction and save me some research?
---
Thanks!
---
That's me too. How did they know?!

I'm not hunting anything, and there's nothing that can link this character name to his real person (i don't know him, never played with him, never heard his name before, reason why i'm surprised why real heavy insults are cheap and free), i could have reported him if i want to harm him or something.
---
Insults are very personal, it's not zlls who received them but my own person.
---
Anyway, just wanted to get some feedbacks, or to sensitive i'm not used to reddit so if it won't get posted it won't change anything.

Wow man those lines in bold

---
Thanks but it  says invalid too, I think they disabled them before the actual expiration date (March 31, 2020)
---
Oh, oh no, I feel I may contribute to this type of behavior.  I've been playing a LONG time, and I have my tags... I may or may not use them when I get drunk and want something done.  If you've ever been in a RIBA group and the comm starts using comm chat to shout garbage rap lyrics at you... hi!
---
I mean I do try my best (albeit drunk) to contribute to what I'm after, but I can't imagine I'm at my best in that moment.
---
No you don‚Äôt. You need only hero points.
---
I don't find your hypothesis believeable without any arguments as of why they would be in a better place, here is my hypothesis:  
---
When they would only go for open world content another huge part of the community will leave and new players won't come in as much, because single player games also offer open world (might not be as good, but atleast the game isn't in danger of being shut down) and there's even less marketing for the game.  Strike missions would disappear as making an entry step to a dead game mode doesn't make any sense.
---
Also in this case for anet to remain this profitable (and by NCSofts pressure they seem to think it's not enough as of now) the remaining players need to make up for the loss of gem store profit aswell. would you pay your part of that difference? you might, but most people won't. Resulting in Anet losing losing loads of money if they would go that way. NCSoft would at that point probably demand it to be only gem store items or completely shut down and fire another bunch of employees. not really what I would call a better place.
---
Reading most of the comments here makes me sad, I dont want GW2 to truly die. 
---
GW2 is not dead yet, a dead game is were no development is in work nor support from the company really which will in the end shut down the game servers. We are not there!!!
---
I still hope and pray ANet could turn around this and perhaps start to excite us again, a 3rd expansion would be amazing.
---
This is my absolute favorite game and I have been playing this ever since the very start, the 3-days ahead launch even, lol.
---
I still have faith in you, ANet! Please dont kill off GW2
---
I doubt there will ever be new elite specs.
---
I received a card once. I was so happy. I contacted them to change my address when I moved because I wanted to ensure I don't miss them if I got selected again. They told me they can't update my address details....
---
I can suggest Destiny 2, if you are into those kind of things, but it is on a very similar path as GW2, and probably heading the same direction, will take less than a year to get there (if they don't change things fast).
---
I‚Äôd save the gold for ascended. You can get trinkets and weapons for free and armor you craft. You can get exotic gear from farming dungeons, also for free. (Free as in it only costs you time, not liquid gold).
---
As for guides: google: so you want to gear a character gw2
---
Follow that guide and you‚Äôll be in full ascended in no time at all.
---
Yknow, I don't quite remember that. Granted, I don't really remember what happened yesterday, either..
---
By ignoring sub rules, you're no better than them. Here's your feedback.
---
well this particular dev wasn't professional to begin with and quite bad at his job, so there's that
---
They're the same fucking thing, Sherlock.  Skill points are an older term.
---
No it was onie of the narrative people.
---
Then use the correct terminology.
---
I even prefer shitty mmorpgs on my phone atm lol
---
I believe I may have sent [my guide](http://bit.ly/gw2help) to you in the past, but if not then go ahead and bookmark it - it'll come in handy.  Using exotic armor will be fine, which you can craft easily or buy from the TP or buy it from the Karma vendor in Orr.
---
For rings, the easiest way to obtain zerker rings is to run the daily fractals. Even running the tier 1 dailies will net you 1 pristine fractal relic per daily and buying the red ring of death + crystalline band will cost 10 pristines each. For the ascended amulet, Bjora Marches (the new zone added in Icebrood Saga episode 1 has a collection titled the hunger that will allow you to purchase a stat selectable amulet. 
---
For accessories, winterberries from Bitterfrost, the lws3 episode 3 map. Then next easiest would be dragonfall (s4e6) since you can also convert eternal ice from bjora into mistborn motes which can be used to purchase an accessory. If you're in a guild that runs guild missions, that's also an option (purchasing accessories for guild commendations) 
---
You'll also want to work towards ascended weapons next before considering armor, which can come last. For the weapons please check tanetris gearing guide which I have linked in my guide. That guide also has alternatives to obtaining all the gear mentioned above. 
---
Sorry I didn't provide more direct links - typed this on my phone. Best of luck and let me know if you have further questions.
---
The unbreakable bell already is a musical instrument and as the novelitie storage only includes the endless versions of the items, i guess this won't happen.
---
Oh really? I didn't know Exotic gear is tied to farming dungeons. I haven't try Dungeons yet, mainly because I try to do things in "Order", and story-wise I was told to finish Personal Story before I'm doing any Dungeons. I'm already at the very end of the Personal Story - so I'm assuming I'll start doing Dungeons soon. I don't have much time to group with people, because the baby cries and I might need to go AFK all the sudden. I understand that the Story section is solo-able? and the other sections require a group? can I farm things from The Story section of Dungeons?
---
I completely forgot you need craft your Armor. My two professions are still pretty low level wise. I should probably level them. No Gold again when leveling professions? or it's harder to grind?
---
that's not true, there are games 7+ years old who are expanding and getting more successful by the day. they're not declining. gw2 died not because playerbase "conviced themselves" that it died, but because of no development, ignoring players, generally becoming a shitty game that people don't wanna play anymore.
---
Thats objectophilia
---
Does anybody care about the rest anyway?
---
Perfectly fine with that buddy. Thats why it's downhill for Anet.
---
My friend, i read (sorry English isn't my native language) the 10 rules right, what rule i'm ignoring?
---
It's not about this this person, i can post way many others.
---
I wanted to have feedback on this kind of player's behavior, i don't see how can this insulting to somebody.
---
They are, just like how the tonics have endless versions.
---
It's true tho. Have you ever played other mmos? Nwords would've been exchanged in wow/wow classic.
---
sorry maybe i'm missing something, what's the rule you're refering to?
---
Daily might be an exageration given the fact that I have never read a nword in gw2 in months of wvw/spvp. But continue.
---
Classic.
---
Its literally irrelevant to talk about dropping your soj trap and f1 1 sec before the boss spawns. Its still part of the rotation you do on the boss and suddenly you do all your burst in the first 1 or 2 seconds of the boss. If you are not going to start 1 sec earlier when there is no downside to it because "burst speed" then its completely pointless to compare
---
I have also never encountered racial slurs in FF14, outside of fluffy open world this community is nothing special
---
&gt; same people who freak out and yell "Game is dead!" any time a known name leaves the company are the exact same people who said the mass layoffs in Feburary were actually good for the game
---
i think you got that backwards, mate
---
&gt; new type of story with Visions of the Past.   
---
I just realised this is another **new thing** made. üòπ   
---
The game is filled with new low replaybility things and no revival of older....things. Like, how much content is literally laying around barely touched. Dungeons, Orr metas, PvP, WvW, living world maps and stories, S3 masteries, etc etc etc.
---
Been there mate
---
What I started to do is say in map/team chat that I'll be tagging up for small scale fights and see who is interested in joining, once I get like 5 or 6, I create the squad and go invisible tag afterwards. Some people can't understand that a tag doesn't mean a zerg and there's nothing you can do about it. Eventually a thick skin will develop and you'll rise above thoose small insults.
---
Burn the witch!
---
I mean... in software industry, it absolutely is. That's often the only way to get a significant raise.
---
I love it too, however... I'm a little put off this year due to last couple years worth of hackers/bots speed-hacking to the center gift then home repeatedly which ruins matches.
---
On top of that, some people did report to support that theirs was lost and got sent another. There are people with two blue bauble infusions.
---
I quite enjoy it too.
---
I just wish the achievement for it gave some AP.
---
Maybe a dev account trying something like with mastery points
---
I love how this chart fails to label its axis, it's as useful as all those "career advice" "professionals".
---
Thats why companies have CMs to talk with people. Developers should not have to do that. And btw dev in your example is as smart as the player.
---
Dev attention is utterly irrelevant. I don't doubt that a lot of devs care about the game and want to put in the effort, but management calls the shots and you won't get their heads out of their asses no matter how hard we try.
---
there are players who are really that desperate who needs to win in a minigame of and dying mmo?
---
I could have sworn, but it's hard to argue after making another account to see myself. Thanks for setting me right.
---
F
---
The client is doing you a favor by not downloading the rest. Please try to understand
---
then report that to the creator and there is a good chance that those people will get blacklisted
---
It's the only thin that would justify "expansion level content" at this rate.
---
I couldn't agree more, OP. I have been,till today, in 3 fractal/raid guild, for like around 3 years or so.And we were around 90-100 players in all of them.Today from all those peoples only 1 still does fractal runs with me.And i have been playing with these guys/girls for like 3 years, doing raids, achiv fractal god title and all that.
---
This boss would be a LOT easier if people would realize that red circles hurt.
---
There is no one-for-all stat. Minstrell for WvW, but Scrapper and Firebrand are the heal of choice there. For PvE Harrier or Plaguedoctor
---
Can confirm. When I started the game I thought I was actually doing lots of damage. Reality, I struggled to break 1k a second. No joke. 
---
Now I'm hitting 26-30k. Same class as before.
---
I just genuinely had no idea I was doing no damage because the game throws the bold numbers at you, it makes it feel good to do damage even if it's a small amount
---
Genuinely curious, can you give me some examples of this? The only one I can think of is World of Warcraft, and even they went through a huge decline and aren't even close to what their peak was. 
---
Also you're already saying gw2 has "died", isn't that jumping the gun?  Consider this: The last raid was released just 6 months ago, the last fractal a little less than year, and the skyscale around seven months ago. 
---
You talk lack of development- but Arenanet has rolled out content despite the layoffs, just not the content tailored to hardcore veterans- but if we were to really break out the numbers, what percentage of the playerbase has actually been doing the most recent raids? Maybe my experience is different, but even most of the veterans I've talked to never bothered to do Key of Ahdashim. After the layoffs and what I'm assuming is a tighter constraint on manpower they decided to forego something that's being played by what 5% of the actual playerbase, even if it is that high- it's almost expected? 
---
And looking backwards from now to all the entire history of GW2, has the game really become shittier? Do you remember how HOT's first reception? We literally got mounts a little more than two years ago and some of the best maps developed less than a year ago. 
---
The game is in a drought, no doubt about that - but back to my original point if the player base gives up, convinces itself that the game is has "died" then the game wont even get a fighting chance at coming back.
---
It's hard for me to fathom how strike missions are preparing casual players for raid content when pugs will run in using racial skills...
---
This and if people learned to watch animations, Boneskinner has easy tells when he is gonna do the charge attack that deals a lot of damage etc.
---
For all new players listen to me very carefully, the copperfed is the best of the best item that is in the gem store. Ultimate Quality of Life. Now it is your chance to get it with reduced price. 
---
Remember, you can use your gold to buy it as well, but if you are very new, I suggest dropping just 10 bucks for this item. No buyer‚Äôs remorse at all. 
---
The silverfed can be ignored because of the existence of mystic salvage kits.
---
stop promoting hackers, also hacking record doesnt count cus they can insta teleport to the end to any place
---
nice stuff
---
Dungeons technically are side story that happens during the personal story. You can check out this [*very* in depth guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/?st=k4selh23&amp;sh=2cc356dd) for the full story in order. All dungeons are designed with 5 players in mind including story mode so while it is possible to solo most of them you're going to have a hard time (especially when not experienced or fully geared). There are a lot of very cheap options to gear up such as buying the berserker stat [named armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) for your armor weight, this will get you the best general stats for power DPS. As for leveling crafting check out [gw2crafts](https://gw2crafts.net/) for a general idea of what to do to level (you can also run boosters and in general you'll need to craft less than what it suggests). I'd suggest you take a look at [my guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) where I have this info, resource links, and more.
---
Thoughts on D/D Full Signets Necro for solo PvE? I'm only Lv.16 but so far I'm really liking the setup but I'm just wondering about the viability a bit later on.
---
It's pretty common to follow creators of any media you like on Twitter.
---
What is your average ping?
---
To be honest at this moment the community is tearing itself apart, the game has been going in a questionable direction(for the more invested player) right after HOT release and since then we are feeding on this negative narrative, always looking only at what's bad about the game.   
---
I am not saying we should stop being critical but if you step out of the scene for a few months and come to it with fresh eyes, you realize how depressing it is, its like everyone wants to be miserable all day.   
---
People keep repeating  the same thing over and over for 3 years expecting different results, realistically speaking from a developer point of view we should have seen massive changes with how the game is going starting with Ice Brood Saga, they had the opportunity after the lay offs to refocus on some much asked for things by the community and they did with some and did not with most.   
---
Its time to accept the game for what it is and keep playing or move on and return whenever there is something new to do.
---
That is a horrible idea and i am glad that you are only a player and not a developer.
---
Yeah I always considered myself to be quite the lore enthusiast. However i am halfway into episode 1 and don't even feel the urge to finish it.
---
Kinda like how people are going back to gw2 really.
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
Which will be a p2w, since cryptic is owned by PWE. Look at their other games. It may not be  harsh p2w like neverwinter is now. But with each update..
---
&gt; you are unable to recover the runes without an Upgrade Extractor or the Endless Upgrade Extractor
---
LMAO - you keep believing that.
---
Gw2 was never a "hardcore" game... Go play something else if you think the utter nonsenses you wrote are correct...
---
If at the end of saga we don't have extension level content, the game is dead.
---
MTG, a mother of TCGs, is by definition a p2w game and I expect no less from their spin off games.
---
[Keeper Jonez Deadrun](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Keeper_Jonez_Deadrun) sells the berserker karma armor in the temple of grenth **but** there is a huge issue that it is not salvageable. This means any good runes you put in there are essentially lost. I'd suggest instead spending the few gold to buy normal armor (or one of the many other ways to farm it) instead of going with karma armor.
---
After the staff changes what did you expect? My point isn't that the content Arenanet has been rolling out in the past couple of months has been good- but that we're jumping the ship too quickly, which will in turn doom the game anyway. 
---
And when exactly did they specifically announce an expansion level upgrade?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV
---
1. Farm gold/mats to sell first few legendaries.
---
2. Exploit market and poor players to sell even more of them.
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
This method has aquired WoodenPotatoes seal of approval of 2019.
---
6) gamble 20 stacks of Ectos
---
7) throw 5 inventorys full of greatswords in the toilet
---
It's not. We're not going to have more raids.
---
That's what point 2 is about :)
---
&gt; Exploit market and poor players to sell even more of them.
---
&gt;
---
  
---
I've been in plenty of triple trouble maps where there were commanders setting up, explaining, and then executing triple trouble. Did you ever check LFG around spawn time? (Cause you know, apparently, checking there is sometimes too much to ask for.)  It sounds like that the maps you're in, are instances with low population, maybe?  
---
Might be playing during off peak hours?
---
Oh, I can spare 15 minutes :-)
---
 " But the facts and actually released content show the exact difference. "
---
you mean opposite, right? :o
---
yea supporter is my favorite class too. really feels like you can make a difference when playing it well.
---
&gt; to move back to their GW1 model
---
they had a cash shop in gw1 as well, but I think this was post EotN
---
Yeah, they'd be pretty stupid to talk to any of you.
---
To be fair if you've played since launch they were called "Skill Points" for a long ass time. I still call them skill points as well, the rename never made much sense.
---
Evolved Jungle Worm is like Chak Gerent. It's better to go to the map so early that you are on the first map when people arrive. 
---
If you do this at reset (I advise you skip Chak Gerent to ensure you're early, it gets done almost every time it's up) you can just wait at the WP and commanders will eventually arrive. In NA I do TT after reset and normally with randoms. No guild commander group.
---
I figured it out a long time ago: One downvote is a bot. Several downvotes are just several people who are wrong. :)
---
During the pax disappointment stream, they said that the saga rebrand also meant that some releases would be non-story releases so they could release expansion-like content. There were also forum posts if I remember correctly.
---
It just amazes me how different this community is ingame and outside ingame its still the greatest MMO community in the genre. Outside bloody hell WoW's community is better than this fucking cesspit.
---
Yes?
---
They are killed just that it is usually organised groups or guilds making them. lfg-tool is your best friend and be there early on the map. 
---
I know there is one guild in NA running it every day, problem is i have no clue what time it really is in NA since i play from EU and for me it is around 2 in the night so cant really help you with that. 
---
In EU i also seen guilds but i rarely do it there since i have all achivements and collections and what not for it and only do it if i happen to pass a map that have a organised group on it when i am there. I seen the group that someone posted a link to in EU try and jump on their runs.
---
Right you realise the last founder of Blizzard just left does that mean that company is dead no it means people are moving on like in every line of work. There are still plenty of GW1 devs at the company who have given years to this community Mike Z started from a QA on Factions and is now the Game Director, Bobby Stein has been at Arenanet since I think Prophecies release, just looking through the wiki of devs so far I've found 38 devs right now who have been with the company from 2004 to 2011 I chose this criteria as this about the time GW1 development was ending. I say 38 devs but the wiki doesn't give dates for all of them if I had to guess there is at least 60 or 70 devs at Anet right now who had some hand in GW1. My point is companies have problems I'd be amazed if any company doesn't it does happen. Devs leave is it sad yes but devs also join. I'm not worried for Anet at all for one they are NCSofts only western developer and are making them a lot of money and secondly we are talking about a company who made a game on less than 100 developers with GW1 Prophecies.
---
Woops, you're right. I corrected it.
---
The line at the lunch stand will move faster allowind devs to get back on their desks quicker than ever!
---
My first impressions from Boneskinner is its mechanic is too easy to outheal, while its mechanic is too hard to do properly.
---
I think this would be a fantastic fight if you couldn't outheal his damage.
---
Also the flavor is super weak... They could have added new animations like how thief holds staff for Daredevil pretty easily, but instead just holds it like a greatsword.
---
It's so vindicating to watch this game fall apart, i told you guys the game was dead
---
These are always posted by people who claim to have a finger on the heartbeat of the community.  As such, we have two options:
---
A) they're lying, as you barely need to check in once a week to see these posts - in which case their 'analysis' is based on shaky ground
---
B) they're not lying, but they're posting yet another one despite having seen so many go up previously - in which case your complaint is invalid
---
I think he refered to the statement that Arena Net did with their number and said that it was hard to ballance it due to the numbers that was given in the first post.
---
Liar, not everyone is a mesmer. I am tho.
---
You are just 7 years too late. It was THE event during the pre HoT phase. Whole communities rose out of this event.
---
&gt; Insults arrive few seconds after i tag up, reason why i don't get it (i can't blame people with mental diseases) 
---
Ignore them. Especially as a commander you need very thick skin because you can¬¥t make everyone happy and some people feel entitled that you fulfill their wishes but ignore the rest.  
---
&gt;  I won two gold WvW seasons, fighted in great guilds, have a deep understanding of my different class mechanics, and even when i join open raid i'm always on top dps/boon strip/cleanse, i can hardly believe that some need rocket science to play WvW in descent way. 
---
You are right that playing decent is not hard but commanding yourself, especially with voice, is way different then following a good commander who knows what he is doing, while staying silent.   
---
To name just a few things you need to keep in mind while commanding: Your zergs positition, comp, strength and weaknesses. Can I stay on range? Do I need to push hard to enable my 10 SPBs? What is the enemy doing? Go Left? Go Right? There is a wall/cliff/choke/tunnel how can I or enemy abuse it?...  
---
When you made a decision you need to communicate that clearly but quick to not waste much time.  
---
Besides that you need to play your own class in a good way to not kill your own party from it.
---
If your zerg is so much ahead skill and number whise of the enemy that just saying left, right and push is enough then everyone could lead them or even nobody it wouldn¬¥t change the outcome.
---
Doing it in a public group and you have no choice, you get what you get because it is not a real group people just port in with what they have.
---
Most people just consume the media and don't care about the largely irrelevant people who worked on it. It's weird man, unless they are like, close personal friends or something.
---
Imagine watching a movie and being like, "I really want to see pictures of the sound guy's dog and get updates about their personal life!" like wtf
---
At least he found the print key...
---
They said Ice Brood Saga would have expansion level content in it not that we'd get a full expansion.  Expansion level content from HoT and PoF were:
---
1) New Maps
---
2) New Stories
---
3) New Masteries
---
4) Mounts/Gliding
---
5) Elite Specs
---
Of that list the Ice Brood Saga has delivered the first three points.  We've seen them deliver on the fourth item in previous living world episode releases.  The only thing that is expansion-level stuff that we are missing with the IBS is Elite Specs.  I think people are expecting Raids and Fractals to be expansion level content but that stuff always came as some other living world (or out of cycle) update.  Should they be updating that content more -- yea, it would be nice just to shut some people up... but I bet you're right about so few people playing that form of content that it doesn't make sense to devote too much time to it.
---
Oh Look!   
---
It's Exactly What I've been telling people , but with better words and everything.
---
your pugs were not humans. You were unlucky to get 9 subhumans with soldier gear who cant dodge and dont know what their skills do. You can do boneskinner with 2-3 subhumans, but if you get 8-9 just quit, and try to get normal group.
---
Doesn't even matter if you tell Anet what you want.
---
We have been screaming from the top of our lungs since even before LWS3 started what exactly we wanted. Anet just simply never gave a shit about what we have to say, they have to listen to NCSofts wishes. And they wish for squeezing every last penny out of us with the cash shop, that's literally the only thing they care for.
---
Old School Runescape
---
For real tho lol, its like weekend at bernies at this point
---
I still don't know how to cancel gs 5
---
1-2 at a time makes sense, however Reddit and the forums would glow incandescent with rage over why they have to wait for [Elite Spec X] when [Elite Spec Y] is already out.
---
I think you're over-extimating how much it costs to click a follow button.
---
I don't use that much twitter but I do have followed lots of ANet dev when there was something about the game happening, like them sharing stuff they've been working on or some artworks of upcoming content.
---
If they really had such a personal use of twitter that they didn't want it to be shared, they would have not a public profile. Heck, this tweet has the precise purpose of being a public farewell.
---
Being what you are calling a casual, I really enjoy the pace of the releases.  It gives  me time to finish the achievements that I want and to still have time for the festivals between these releases.  
---
I am not sure what qualifies content as being "re-playable".  I hear this thrown about a lot.  There really is no content that is re-playable for eternity.  It all gets old after a while.  Are there any examples of an MMO that has re-playable content that is not being replayed solely for fun and not because some reward has not dropped yet?
---
I prefer not having skins for anything to be locked behind forced group content and would like to never see that implemented at all.  That being said, it would be nice to have some mount/glider skins available through some form of quest/collection, but leave it all soloable.  MMO means that I am playing solo with other people for me, not being forced to associate with them.
---
I mean, yeah? Especially in the US, sticking with the same job for more than 5 years is the exception not the rule. Even League, the biggest most successful game in recent history has had tons of developers leave one way or another. Course its normal.
---
IS nobody realizing just how Fuckawful that'll make the balance team's job?   
---
They're already struggling to get people to play ANY core spec over the Two elites, Thus rendering Effective WvW Play a game of " Can you buy the X-Pac Or do you prefer to be suboptimal and Therefore Kicked out of MOST content? "   
---
Which, yes, is more a problem with Blistering elitism in raids than anything.   
---
WvW Will be widely uneffected because you can run just about anything in a blob and still get kill credit / contribute.  
---
But Imagine 36 Different Possible things to play , each one with it's own unique Niche and gearing type that makes it effective or Fun.   
---
And then imagine trying to balance 36 Fucking Class Subtypes , Traitline Synergies ( 8 traitlines Per character Post-new-elite! ) , Gear + Rune + Sigil Synergies, Food and Buff stacking And More.   
---
OH , and you gotta do it perfectly or the community is gonna build your crucifix for you .
---
not sure if it's off peak or not but not really my choice, is it? I don't chose when the worm sporns lol
---
lfg seems pretty dead
---
thx anyways
---
Yup! Due the holidays we do fewer runs, but you can always join our Discord for info/taxi for when we go for a run! (Discord also at the website, phone didn't let me grab the link itself)
---
Axe is fine to yolo camps, i switch weapons according to the situation, what makes you thik axe/axe is for noobs in a situation where we were like two capping a tower?
---
War is more than ok for commanding, you have the adrenaline to push, you need more focus and less dancing left and right untill you looks 3/4 of your squad, i used to tag with firebrand but it's less fun to solo roam with. (I saw amazing scourges and tempests as comanders on deso and it's not a solo game).
---
Fights is everywhere my brother, you can call it, just hit any wsr wall and you'll get 25+ of them.
---
Last, there's nothing to gain here, no real money, no power, no glory and not even sex, so the word "proving" is somehow strong, as many i use dps meter and i believe any one can be surprised to see how people are doing. It's not about trash commander lot (if we do not count ppl afking 24/24 at spawn) of players can be as bad.
---
Notice that i do not use the word trash, and i never have the conviction from one screenshot or one sentence, or one blue square tag that someone is dumb and do not want to learn, you're really too fast to make conclusions.
---
It's just about few hours of time to share with strangers, if you can be kind with your familly or teamates, just try to be it with all people, again there's no money to gain, i came back, i saw, and i'm leaving this game, maybe in annother life.
---
Cheers.
---
It‚Äôs been called hero points for longer than they were called skill points.
---
well, you will eventually run out of mystic stones for mystic salvage kits. SilverFed is still must have and it becomes cheaper after 200k salvages.
---
I've tried it a couple of times: doesn't feel that hard honestly. Just not as absolutely braindead as the other bosses, or the story...or most things I've done til now in this game.
---
You literally only need enough people who know what they're doing. It's not hard to figure out what to do. And when looking at other bosses for example: gathering a lot of people doesn't seem too hard either.
---
Makes me worry a bit about the standard of the game/standards of players
---
They went with the wrong balance, instead of forcing players to do the mechanics they increased the damage over time you take, so people stack healers instead of doing mechanics, Anet TM, good idea, bad realisation.
---
This is such low effort you didn't even hide the GS to make the picture look decent.
---
I'm not sure what you mean because the only opinion I've heard from anyone in the hardcore scene is that they love the combat.
---
going same route as DAOC they gave up their main game so they can work on something new(warhammer) then something new failed they also lose their main game.
---
Do you know how much gold is 1 opened fractal chest on average?
---
The stances are kinda nice when playing in an group
---
Who here can honestly say they would not be happy with bi-yearly expansions with replayable maps, elite specs and  new group-oriented content, be that raids or fractals. I don't believe that it's a bad form to do business in, but ofc nothing can beat the mobile-game MTX games in profits. 
---
I believe the reason they don't do that because it takes a lot of dev time and they don't want to be a one-hit wonder. Living world probably is the more cost-effective way for them to keep going while they develop a second foot to stand on. Unfortunately, it does not go unnoticed in the quality of the patches.
---
Honestly I would've preferred if they went out with a bang, one last expansion instead of just fizzling out in uncertainty, but unless it's guild wars 3 they've been working on, I don't see how well the community would've taken that either.
---
I'm happy to keep coming for patches but honestly I've had little interest in joining in on release dates.
---
Go check any dev's twitter and click on any random post and read some of the replies from people with furry and/or anime profile pics and tell me it isn't weird
---
too much organization required for reward/time
---
It was literally right after that banwave.
---
*Do you wanna*
---
I agree with this 100% " ArenaNet needs to put more investment into re-playable content and listen to their community. We have to come together and realize we need both casual and hardcore players for GW2 to live up to its potential. "
---
I don't think you needed to add the whole stop your whining bit, as you say yourself we need both casual and hardcore player content and the only way Anet will hear us is to voice our individual opinions.
---
This is how I've become as well. After HoT, I took an extended hiatus from the game. I came back a few months ago, purchased PoF and played through it. I had a lot of fun and even went so far as to grind all the way to get the skyscale. 
---
Started the Icebrood Saga but just lost interest in the game again due to the long periods of inactivity between releases.
---
Also, probably my biggest issue is how the game seems to have become nothing more than a backdrop for the gem store. It just seems like it's become a guy on a stage showing off the gem store and then saying "oh by the way, there is this game here that you can show off all of your purchases in so everyone can see how much money you've spent!", which is pretty much how EVERY OTHER game seems to be done now.
---
Lag is your enemy; not the class, not the skill, and certainly not the people who don't main warrior.
---
Thieves can teach you a few things about real "clunky mobility". I'm sure they enjoy using 6 initiative for a total 0 displacement due to uneven ground and random obstacles, and getting "no line of sight" for their steal with absolutely no visible obstacle.
---
Ah yes, I remember Annas badass greatsword.
---
Looks good, though :)
---
&gt; Deso commanders DODGES fights all the time
---
"all the time" is a problem, but dodging fights is a smart move if you know you would loose anyway. Just going elsewhere and being generally a pain by taking objectives without giving bags sounds like a pretty smart strategy to me. Just head-ramming into the main enemy blob sounds just dumb to me.
---
Why are you booing him he's right
---
But leggies aren't sold at tp. They are sold on gw2exchange = no tax

They've been playing for two months and already sound like a salty veteran.

You may just look at lfg at the wrong time. When the event is "up" is the wrong time. 15 to 30 minutes earlier is a lot better: it is then that maps are organized and fill up. Once the event really starts, the good maps are usually full already and taken off lfg.
---
Thoughts on trading a person gold for gemstore gifts since the exchange rates aren‚Äôt balanced,  making it a win win. (Is this against TOS?)
---
IMO
---
Deso/BT: if you want more karma-training/PPT/blob oriented gameplay
---
WSR/As: if you like on and off skirmishes at Towers/SM with other with occasional blobbing
---
&gt; perhaps this game is not meant for every player 
---
It's also equally fine, not all games are meant to be sempiternal classics that last decades with positive community sentiment about them. Sometimes, they just devolve into gacha simulators, and That's Fine, they just die. 
---
&gt;This is the foundation of every "if you don't like it you can leave" argument.
---
And this is the foundation of how a game dies. The game's combat system, art assets, and general setting, all have massive potential that is wasted by Anet's current direction. It's not about "hard dedicate their time", getting good, or no-lifing the game, it's about the game having satisfying, thematic rewards for your playtime. 
---
I started playing this game on April, I finished all story content by now, and every time I see a discussion on reddit about how to better the game, there is an appaling number of players saying "you can leave if you don't like this". THAT is what kills games, not the people suggesting how to get the game back on track, or mad about the current state of whatever system they are ranting about.
---
A playerbase vocally complacent about the state of the game, urging people critiquing it to stop playing while the company pushes out an aggressive gacha monetization style on their game with most good looking cosmetic rewards costing 5-20‚Ç¨ a pop on the gem store if they are ever available as direct purchase, or just a gacha gamble for a chance at a rare or unique reward, completely pushing any good thematic reward into an inmersion-breaking "BUY THIS FOR GEMS AFTER LOOPING X TIMES THROUGH FARM TRAINS" gemstore purchase. THAT is what kills games. This is specifically the reason I have stopped playing this game. I have 3 level 80 characters, and zero incentive to chase anything. The story was good while it lasted, but the endgame, the content you actually play MMOs for, is abysmal in terms of engagement.
---
Those are good to get "little, easy and safe money". To get more, you will need others, and most of the time that means, play the TP, and play it well.
---
Do you want to get a new skin? 
---
Come on log in and pay... 
---
You don't even have to raid or do achieve.
---
All you need to do is paaaaayyyy...
---
We used to do dungeons.
---
And now we're not
---
I wish they would tell us why
---
Do you want a new skin?
---
It can even be a mount skin. 
---
Or Fractal leader boards and moreeee?
---
I think some content are overdue
---
We started spamming banners on the wall..
---
It gets a little lonely
---
All this empty map
---
Just watching the meta fail...
---
Anet, please I know you're in there
---
Players are asking where you've been
---
Casual say, "have hope" and I'm trying to
---
Were right out here for you
---
Just let us in
---
We only have strike now
---
It's just not enough
---
What are we gonna do?
---
there was a "community" that was used to do TT every day at least 2 times , but i think is disbanded now...
---
Such big drums and all they had to show off was a trailer and FunkoPops... I haven't logged in since
---
Last week WSR had like 10 soulbeast when we were looking to fight your squad.
---
i remember the first kill with gw2community after a fucking week doing 3-4 try per day... it was awesome when finally we kill it
---
I agree. Which is why I told him to convert his gold into gems to buy it.
---
Deso and blacktide probably has the most fight commanders right now, as well as night chatmanders ppting, but I would look elsewhere, as it's pretty stacked here right now.
---
WSR has a few commanders, but otherwise it's clouds hanging around Stonemist.
---
GH is also pretty stacked too, SFR maybe a bit more active due to transfers and Gandara is out of T1, with maybe a few active commanders left.
---
It was the perfect opportunity to use Snowball Mayem as the first off season mini-season event, but alas, they didn't have the time and ressources because PvP is 2 devs in a corner of the building.
---
I didn't talk about the announcements here - I was talking about the reasons behind locking new content which should actually be included into the last addon, behind paywalls (just like it was the case earlier) - Gw2 did not improve the engine or mechanics - nor did they introduce mentionable changes in endgame content like WvW so I don't think there's a reason for actually selling those things...
---
well u said it urself, those are way too big ifs for the gw2 playerbase
---
You are potentially telling new players that "$20 unlocks the entire game for you." Do you really think they know that the living world seasons are not included in it? ... If they even know what they are.
---
We have log in rewards.
---
Even if it's a self-fulfilling prophecy none of the complaints and negativity are entirely made up. It's all rooted in something real. If Anet wants to keep people playing and thus keep potential people buying into the gem store(their chosen MMO business model) then there needs to be something for people to do. IMO the best way they could accomplish that and kill two birds with one stone is with new Elite Specs. WvW and PvP essentially have to create its own content with fights/competition and Raiders have to learn E-spec mechanics and figure out comps. Trickling down from that are Fractal goers who also have to figure out comps and specs if they do any sort of min-maxing/speed running. Elite Specs would revitalize and shake up all of the game modes and give players, especially veteran players who've seen everything they want to see something new to figure out and play with. So at least for me my saltiness is due to Anet seemingly not having Elite Specs on the radar. They merely said, "its on the table".
---
Them and the fact that we (a 20man squad) were fighting you (40+man squad) while you needed to play with your arrow carts, banners and canons to kill one of us.
---
As some others said. It's their way of making money and keeping people logging in. If you don't log in once every three months it seems you have lost interest in the game, so now they charge you. 
---
And as for not introducing changes, i would agree that story is bad content, but it's the only content they do and so they charge for it cause it costs money to create.
---
The LW stories were always free if you were logged in during when it was current and you'd have to purchase with in game gold if not. The way I'd look at it is the new LW chapters are rewards for playing. If you're playing you're either spending money on gems/gold OR you're doing things keeping those who are spending. 
---
Changed a lot from season 1 sure, but after that not so much. I mean lots of stuff and content added but the business model and in game community hasn't really changed since season 3. (other than no more Xpacs :( 
---
With the time the game's been out I do wish for new players they'd sell episodes as a package, but then how'd that work for players who've played season 3 but not season 2? Would they have to pay for season 3 again?
---
sorry for missunderstandings but by dodging i meant Deso commanders tags down when WSR commanders tags up because they get destroyed almost always. It wasn't about dodging fight itself, it was intentional avoiding to tag up when WSR commander is up.
---
Boneskinner is what the other strike missions should be: a stepping stone to raids. It is meant as a raid preparation, not as just another fun thing for casuals. It is meant to prep you for raids and in order to do that it must hit you, hurt you, wipe you, until you are ready to learn tactics, mechanics, and using a correct type of build.
---
Just like raids, you can either do the mechanics and go for a slower but safer kill ( and if you do it that way there is no need for massive benchmark damage), or you can ignore/dps through mechanics if you are good enough for a faster kill but taking more risks. Unless you are a pro ( if you are in strike missions for their intended purpose, being to learn the basics, you are probably not) ignoring mechanics means you die. It is not that different in raids.
---
It was never meant as a walking loot bag, if anything the other strike missions should be buffed as well ( just not to Boneskinner level since Anet mentioned they wanted Boneskinner to be the hardest of the bunch we got so far). While Anet should be more clear where on the scale of challenge they wish to put these strike missions ( Right now I would rate Boneskinner below raids, below fractal CM's, but around the upper half of T4), a lot of wipes right now are mostly because pugs refuse to learn or even listen.
---
When I explain mechanics, I usually already get 2 people leaving. When I get to the part where I start to explain a bit more about roles and asking if people want to try/volunteer, another one or two leave without a word.
---
Next I get interrupted by people saying "lets ggoooooooo gogogo" and rushing in without reading or listening to anything.
---
People refuse to do mechanics, or even worse, refuse to do anything. They ignore torches, they ignore the spawned adds, they ignore the breakbar, they even refuse to dodge out of the Boneskinner AoE pools. And they continue to do so even after I have explained it multiple times.
---
Most of the time I even get rude responses after I whisper people about what went wrong and what might help them. Even daring to suggest people to do a mechanic, to dodge, or change a weapon/trait/skill is met with anger and refusal.
---
I even got called out for being a shitty healer ( naturally, I play healer scourge) by a guy. Guy however managed to always be on the opposite end of the arena of everyone else ( rule 1: You cannot get heals if you are not near a stack or move around like such a headless chicken I waste 2 of my 3 shroud charges to get one near you and you still manage to dodge the healing and barrier) or managed to stand in 3 Boneskinner damage pools at once without dodging even a single time.
---
For many people it is not a difficulty problem, it is a mentality problem. And with that mentality, you will also fail in raids or high fractals. So why should you succeed in content that tries to teach you these things? That way you will never learn.
---
Those that want to learn and actually take advice will still get there ( and for those people there will always be people like me who are willing to explain and teach!). It is those that refuse to learn or change anything that will not.
---
This made me lol in the real world.
---
That tongue bleb tho.
---
Hi guys. I took my time and made [this drawing of us.] (https://imgur.com/a/UfX3oSc) I call it "Big Happy Family" and it represents us as a community. My dream is one day we can all walk happily together like this. Sorry I cry.
---
Ok, byeeeee~~~
---
Having problems with ele attunement swapping. My profession skills are bound to Shift + 1/2/3/4/5.
---
While I'm not moving I can use the shortcuts to swap between attunements without problems, but while I'm running I can't switch to Air using Shift 3. The other attunements work though. Clicking on Air manually or using F3 works too.
---
Can anybody explain this to me?
---
She actually use a single hand sword in 2
---
Yeah I can imagine selling them in packages would be neat. Not sure how they could do it.. 
---
Gw2 has a complicated business model. I am never sure if they are pay to play or free to play... it feels like it was designed like Gw1 back then - but during the years they decided to turn it into one of those Korean MMOs. Usually it's always clear: Either you pay once per month and get everything or you don't pay at all or a very few amount of money and have to buy everything instead of content.
---
But with Gw2 it's everything - you pay for the game, you pay for the armors and you pay for content... It's chaotic in my opinion.
---
I am just glad they already published many armors before they started selling outfits only on the gemstore...
---
I don't consider what I stated as "getting personal". It's merely an observational comment.
---
The vibe your posts give off is that you have been brought up as a self entitled spoiled brat.
---
Moved on? Probably fired once NCSoft found out how much of a colossal fuckup he caused.
---
As long as you've done everything there is to do with Grawnk, you should be able to collect the items from chests whenever you want, even after Wintersday.
---
With that said, it's not really that much of a grind.  You find a chest, open it, and get your item.  It should be an almost guaranteed drop, so it's usually just a matter of waypointing to a region and finding the relevant chest there.
---
People that sell gifts have no resources to craft legendaries themselves. You seem to think opportunity cost is not a thing.
---
Also people that sell gifts need gold, not mats, thus gw2 exchange isnt really more gold. Because you will still have to pay the tp fee when you sell those tax-less mystic coins.
---
But keep thinking that 450 gold *now* out of a gift is a bad deal because you can get 650 out of a legendary in... X months (because a new player most definitely can't farm a legendary in a month).
---
Heck, i literally craft about a  leggy per month or so and i regret selling a meteorlogicus (yes, at tp, because i needed liquid gold) instead of just the gift.
---
I have rewards missing on 8 tournaments over the last 2 weeks, and the monthly. I have not contacted support, as I assumed they keep records and will send everyone the rewards owed to them when they fix the bugs, but now I am wondering if they actually will do that.
---
This continuing situation is unacceptable, I play tournament a lot because I like it, but I do want the rewards also. The last tournament I also got no rewards, that's why I came to check here. 
---
Warning, if you play tournament, you may get no reward.
---
[Yup.](http://giant.gfycat.com/InferiorBlushingErne.gif)
---
You're a very friendly person. Thanks alot for informing me about my life. :)
---
Very nice! Can we also see a front view? Would like to see which skins you used!
---
That's a great gif.
---
&gt;  I also love the condition cleanse/transfer on dagger offhand; I like the idea of using dagger mainhand immobilzing someone, inflicting bleeding on myself and then transfering that bleeding to them; feels really dynamic and intuitive.
---
The condition transfer is a very useful skill on off-hand dagger, the main issue with it in your setup is that as a Power build, your conditions are very weak, and thus the bleed you're generating on yourself and giving to your opponent will only do miniscule damage.  That setup is much more effective with a higher Condition Damage stat... which would mean giving up the base Power damage on your main-hand dagger.
---
It's open world, so as mentioned above you can do whatever you want, and the cleansing aspect of the condition transfer is still useful regardless even if transferred conditions don't wind up hurting much.
---
Leafs from the vine
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
thanks but I just paid for it last night before I saw this.
---
Scepter is your primary condition damage main-hand weapon.
---
The Power stat increase base ability damage.  It needs to be noted that "basic attacks", the 1 button auto-attacks, are still abilities that have their own effects.  The thing about Power, which is hard to identify without digging into the Wiki, is that it affects different attacks to different levels.  Some weapons like Dagger and Greatsword for Necromancer will have abilities that scale highly with increased Power.  Other weapons like Scepter will have abilities that don't scale much with increased Power at all (which is fine, because their focus is on the conditions they inflict).
---
This is tricky because sometimes you have weapons like the Firebrand's Axe, added via Path of Fire and looking like a weapon focused on inflicting conditions.  However, for some reason it was also given a high Power scaling coefficient, making a weapon that looks like it's focused on inflicting Bleeding and Burning into a very strong direct damage weapon too.  This is something you won't know unless you're checking the Wiki, or being advised by someone else who's checked the Wiki. ;)
---
And a final bit of advice, generally the levelling experience is easier with a Power build.  I can tell I've tempted you with talking about conditions, and Necromancer is a very adept class at inflicting conditions with tools like that Dagger off-hand, Epidemic, Blood is Power and Plague Signet, among others.  It's just a little bit harder to kill things with conditions at lower levels than it is to simply blast them into oblivion with direct damage.  You can still switch over if you want, it's easy enough to swap and try things out, just don't get disappointed if it's slower than you expected.  Things will get better at level 80!
---
Because he is disappointed and taking revenge this way. I mean, its not hard or time consuming and, well corporation is not your friend. 
---
Does it look good? No. Does company partialy responsible for it? Yes.
---
Okay, bye....
---
Instead of spending hours farming or flipping on TP, get a job and convert money to gems?
---
Watching your history of posts makes me wonder why you are here on reddit writing about a game you obviously have no interst in anymore at all. And yet every day more posts like this. It is a bit sad, isn't it?
---
That's called being petty as hell
---
Not sure why you are experiencing this but holy hell why would you put the most important hotkeys on such terrible hotkeys.
---
English (sadly) not my native language, so I may sometimes strugle with expressing my thoughts, but in general I prefer to be a bit vague in internet discussions.
---
Do you mean, the game will change and won‚Äôt be able to go back to the way it was before, or players who left won‚Äôt ever go back, or something else?  That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs not clear.
---
Technically it is fair play. Tags who don't spy can but choose not to because of internet honor. Information is useful and knowing the numbers of the opposing zerg as well as who is leading them is the key to making good decisions before a fight occurs. 
---
Not to mention it's very easy to avoid being spied on. Verification on discord and appearing offline in-game. Those who get spied just aren't aware.
---
I think you got it the other way around. Your tags ragequit complaining about dragon banners while having 3+ in his squad at all times. Or maybe you mean "fights" as in sitting in SM with a 50 man cloud and 100 arrow carts? I mean shit, there's so much trash on WSR these days you're literally building catapults on top floor fingers. Don't get me wrong, we look forward to WSR matchups, but there's just a handful of fights worth the time. Organized fights are good for 20 minutes, you lot wipe a few times and start with your pulls and shit and no one can be arsed anymore.
---
I just gave up and stopped caring. Nothing can save this game now.
---
I had same problem as u. in most instances 40-100 ping, but when it comes to wvw.. or even sometimes pvp.. but I were playing on wifi. When I switched to LAN, lagg problem was solved
---
if you don't see water you might want to update your version of d912pxy that bug should have been fixed quite a while ago
---
The sword she uses is more like a frost conjure.
---
In GW2 there's nothing quite like it.  
---
Even the corrupted sword and kodan sword are frozen  blades instead completely made out of ice.  
---
And the frostforged sword has a metal handle. 
---
There's the coldsnap scepter, and the dagger Jormag's needle, but they don't look enough like a sword.
---
There's also the Glacial Sword, which looks completely made out of ice, but it looks more like a rapier. 
---
If there was an icy sword shaped like Infinite Light, that would be just right. but without that, the next best thing would be the corrupted blade as the ice is bright blue and covers the metal inside well enough if you don't look too close.
---
that's called organizing but ok
---
You are wearing blinders and living in some delusion. /r/2007scape is double the size of this subreddit, far more active, and about a third of their playerbase actually uses Reddit. Take 5 minutes to do a reality check and compare all time top posts on /r/guildwars2 to all time top posts on other "peaked" games and you will see which are stale and which are fresh. You will also notice that all time posts on GW2 are mostly complaints and negativity, and in other games they are high quality original content. 
---
The people defending this game are some of the most extremely introverted and mob mentality folk I've seen on any other game. It's no wonder devs largely ignore this subreddit when it's devolved into furries posting their charr and upvote quaggan LOL memes. We went from a medieval themed fantasy game with established story to an emotional fanfiction with out of place graphics. Why would the original team want to work on a game that has deviated entirely from its roots? Zealots remaining in this game defend it as if it was their religion; though it probably is the most important thing in life for most people here why is why they so vehemently oppose anyone who speaks otherwise. 
---
If you were raised in a cult for 10 years and that was all you knew of the world you would naturally want to destroy free spirited people who have no life-long affiliation to one single game.
---
Yeah the F is even worse lal.
---
I have profession skills on / Z X C, utilies on RFV, weapon skills on Q E 1 2 3, Elite on 4, Heal + Dodge on side mouse buttons, weapon switch on middle mouse.
---
Have you ever seen a fail/near-fail Octovine? This community is filled with human toxic waste and people like you painting it as somehow special and more friendly are not doing anyone any favors.
---
What do you need so much gold for?
---
There is a guy with almost 1,000 stacks of bloodstone dust..
---
It's pure QoL, buy it if you don't want to deal with the MF. I don't regret it for a second.
---
This game sucks don't play
---
I feel that, even tho the copper fed is still a good item to have, it's utility has gone down somewhat with the introduction of unidentified gear.  Without having blues and greens cluttering up the inventory, you don't need to be able to salvage on the fly as much anymore.  I still think it's a good item to buy, but no longer a must have. As for the silver-fed, it's obsolete.  You should get the runemaster salvage-o-matic, since it's 30 copper with only a 5% reduction in rare drops.  I never use my silver fed anymore, personally.
---
thanks!
---
I tried using the -assetsrv thing but no go. I didn't try using it with an IP on the end, yet. I go this but not sure what I should do with it.

&gt; well, **you will eventually run out of mystic stones** for mystic salvage kits.
---
Who does enough rare-and-up salvaging that this ever happens? I use Mystic kits and my stockpile of stones goes up anyway.
---
Yeah same. Went from having 6 hours of logged in time a day to only log in 2 times a week for my static raids. I was rly hyped about everything until they killed templates and gave us loadouts. My static is taking a 2 weeks break and i'm not planning on login in until we go back to raiding.
---
So yeah i went from 6 hours a day to 6 hours a week...
---
But the handle is too dark and it has that hanging thing in the pommel.
---
There's also the zodiac sword, which is also kind of blue, but has that face in it.
---
This game is in disarray.  
---
Sad.
---
Perfectly said. Life's too short to keep holding out for something to change. I jumped off GW2 years ago and haven't looked back
---
I'm having issues downloading the game.
---
I'm currently not at home for the Holidays and I was able to download Fallout76 (~80 go) and even Red Dead Redemption 2 (120 go) just fine but now it's been three nights in a row that I start the client and eventually it falls to 0mb/sec and get stucks at 1%.
---
How do I solve this? At this rate I'll have spent my entire week off just trying to download the freakin' thing.
---
Have you read the links I provided?
---
Use the nslookup (what you added) to get an asset server IP. Choose any one of the IPs and append them to the -assetsrv parameter. And add this to the shortcut of the game.
---
by this logic, you can succeed with literally anything thus making the word itself worthless
---
why qualify/describe something if it doesn't actually mean anything? let's replace it with flooberwoop! 
---
"hey guys looking for a flooberwoop thief build please?"
---
"hey buddy all builds are flooberwoop please use [insert random word i prefer instead] to describe them"
---
such nonsense lmao
---
Same. I honestly only log in to play the minigames during the festivals now. Snowball mayhem and Lunatic Inquisition yessssss
---
I would never do it man, I'm just a pessimist. Because slow releasing elite specs or making elite specs a micro transaction sounds exactly like where we're going.
---
GW1 is in maintenance mode. No significant gameplay-impacting changes will occur. The most substantial changes to GW1 in the last few years were hack-y changes by a single dev whose duties included other things besides GW1.
---
Yeeepp. I'm not saying they'd release then when they finished, I'm saying there's a chance they'll intentionally stagger them.
---
This is probably good news considering how incompetent at his job he was
---
&gt;We have to come together and realize we need both casual and hardcore players for GW2 to live up to its potential.
---
From a hard core casual's perspective:
---
Hardcore players leave because new content for them is far between and when they do get something casuals complain that they're missing it and shouldn't have to do more than stand wherever and spam 1.
---
For me a couple Raids every year just isn't enough to keep me playing, or spending, like I used to. PoF was so pathetically easy, maybe not a walking sim but walking sim adjacent, that other than pretty new maps there wasn't much for me. HoT has been so nerfed and mounts added that its sucked any joy of accomplishment out of it. That's fine for casuals I guess if that's what they want but there hasn't been balance for those that want more.
---
I used to play a ton of sPvP because of the combat system and challenge, but the game mode is in such a state that the only challenge is if you get a bad Queue draw keeping it with in 200 pts and if you get a good draw how many kills you can get farming the other team's Gold 1 player. Now I just spend that time in LoL.
---
Used to get hours of fun solving solo boss kills. Bet I spend at least 200 hours learning to solo all the HP and MP bosses in HoT. PoF not a single HP boss first time through got my a quarter of my health. Seriously, most of the PoF HPs can be beaten with Rare gear on Core thief builds. Bounties were cool but nearly impossible to solo because of the spawn mechanics making too difficult to get in attempts to learn and aren't hard with a group of random casuals just spamming 1 clueless of ground circles and blue bars. Now I'll spend that time playing games like Dark Souls and Witch 3 on Death March or Cuphead or something.
---
GW2 has always been a Theme Park, I love that about it. But more and more it's become a theme park without exciting roller coasters, just ferris wheels and ring toss games.
---
Just finished reading through it. Going to give it a shot.
---
Do a mix of Bjora Marches (a vendor there exchanges ice shards for LS4 currencies - no daily limit) and farming LS4 maps.

There's a chance your keyboard doesn't support being able to hit those specific keys simultaneously. I use the same keys for my profession skills and have had no issues but I use a mechanical keyboard with N-key rollover

If you want to use greatsword I would maybe look to play a shatter mirage as that can be a high impact role with good mobility and burst
---
...or your chronos can share aegis...or the fb can share stab or aegis...idk...just a thought.
---
It's very low on the list.  There are many other things that would provide more QoL and it's better to save your gold/gems to getting those like shared inventory, bank tabs, bag slots, VIP passes, unlimited gathering tools, permanent contracts, etc.
---
At the end of the day, the Mystic is 10x more charges on a kit to salvage a rarer item type that doesn't drop as much so the silver is much less utility than the copper fed. Because a lot of gear drops as unidentified now, the chances that you will be like "oh no, I must clear all these yellows out of my bags" is also lower than it was before. The mystic kit is also much cheaper per salvage. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Silver-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic#Notes
---
Eventually you will run out of mystic forge stones, but by that point you will have amassed so much stuff that the question will become moot. I bought the silver fed a few years ago (maybe 2-3?) and started using it conjunction with the loads of mystic kits I still had. I salvage all the yellows I find. The result? According to efficiency I still have 7 mystic kits standing in random places and 421 mystic stones unused.
---
Basically, if you have to ask, no. It's a very minor QoL boost that you may buy if you ran out stuff to do, and by that time penny pinching the last bit of your drops is a very low priority.
---
It's supposed to be an entry level encounter to raids...like strike missions were meant to be.
---
Wintersday is all ruined for me this year because of the daily bug that doesn‚Äôt allow wintersday cheer to complete, I‚Äôam not even playing the game since :-(
---

Your first mistake is thinking were going somewhere hah! And you call yourself a pessimist
---
Oh, Wiki said it has a big drop rate, but not almost guarantee. I'm enjoying Jumping puzzles, so I will assume at some point I will unlock it with time than. Thank you1 :-)
---
&gt;  I don't chose when the worm sporns lol
---
You can. There's a guild upgrade to spawn it
---
You can try it out as it has F2P version with limitations - then you can decide if its worth your time and money. There's no sub fee; item shops is present with QoL items, account/character upgrades, as well as skins and of course optional loot boxes. 
---
And yeah, people do complain here and while some arguments are justified there are still people who bitch for sake of bitching and the "dedicated" anti-whiteknights who are coming here, not actually playing but having the goal of disencouraging other players and potential ones from having fun for whatever reasons they think are good. Some are doing this for years in this sub under various accounts which clearly qualifies as mental issue.
---
And?.......
---
You can't stay the same forever and expect to survive.  In 2012 and for a few years GW2 was doing well but if you never change then you get left behind.  If you don't adapt to the times you get passed over.  I'm sure some people have the original Model T automobile does that mean it's fine because it's unchanged?  No.  By your logic nearly every other person is "wrong" because they changed their idea of what an automobile is or should be.
---
That's what happened in GW2, that and living in a bubble.  Those that have only played GW2 as their main game won't see that the grass is greener.  Once you start playing other online games and realize the communication from the developers and content releases is far superior to GW2 and Anet you will then see how bad GW2 really is.
---
I appreciate that you took the time to really read and digest my comment, because unfortunately some of the responses I‚Äôm getting seem to have missed the point and still think I‚Äôm talking about GW2 specifically even though I tried to make it clear that this isn‚Äôt an issue that is unique to the GW2 community.
---
I agree that growing up and finding yourself invested in projects outside of gaming is a big part of the decline of a lot of individuals‚Äô participation in MMOs and shift into more casual gaming. A lot of people who still put in a bit of time into MMOs are now approaching the 25-50 year age range, they‚Äôve got full time jobs, social lives, side hustles and projects, hobbies, and relationships to maintain. Some of them are starting families and are finding it hard to balance an MMO into all the other stuff they have going on. 
---
We have an older generation of gamers that are becoming more invested in real life and less invested in games, we have a younger generation of gamers who are more interested in competitive games that they can pick up quickly and drop as quickly as they‚Äôve picked it up, and that doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of players who are actually fully invested in MMOs right now, it‚Äôs become a pretty niche thing.
---
&gt;and on top of that the games market gets more saturated every year with everything from AAA to indie games all competing for that time.
---
The older I get, the more inclined I am to take a long hiatus from MMO gaming to jump into a AAA title I‚Äôm excited about, or an indie game I really like. I can start them and stop them any time I want which leaves me with a lot more free time and flexibility than MMOs offer me, I don‚Äôt have to build the rest of my life around what‚Äôs basically a vice.

According to OP, you can be Cool, but not Smart! :3
---
If you present this "S A G A" as having expansion-level features as they did multiple times you would expect expansion level features like, I don't know, **elite specs**. 
---
Nice try though.
---
If anyone actually still believes that, then they are under a grand delusion.
---
The "best community" died back in 2014.
---
You can find extreme toxicity even in open world metas now...and that's not even a competitive gamemode (where toxicity is normally expected).
---
&gt;...we only get about an hour of story content every couple months and all of the flashy items and rewards seem to go to the cash shop first.
---
It usually takes a friend and I three or so hours to play through a new episode on release day.  We're thorough, we explore a lot, we read dialog, contribute to the Wiki along the way, etc.  Then in the weeks following, we'll play through again independently with other characters at our own pace.  This works for me, and I have learned how to best pace myself and consume new content in such a way that I don't feel as... underserved, as you seem to.
---
Maybe, then, you should consider finding yourself a new game to invest your time into instead of contributing to the FUD-laden doom-and-gloom atmosphere with this kind of post.  **If the** ***pay once and be done*** **no-subscription model doesn't suit you, perhaps you should find a game with a hefty subscription fee so you can bypass the cash shop and get your shinies without "paying" for them.**
---
Toxicity is justified...right.....
---
Same here, arcdps made me 20x the player. I honestly think a in-game meter would be a positive thing down the line, if they want to push harder content they should promote getting better, part of it would be a in-game DPS meter of your squad/party.
---
But I don't think this will ever happen, they will just adopt easier content and abandon any hard content, from what I've seen so far I'm willing to bet the next strike mission will be far easier than boneskinner...
---
Thanks a lot for your clarifications! 
---
Much appreciated
---
Why don't you leave and make room for someone who is interested in playing?
---
Anet isn't making much by contrast to Lineage 2 mobile.  compare gw2's peak of like 30 million to the literal 1 billion Lineage 2 mobile made in a year during 2018. Apparently this year lineage 2 is nearing/has hit the 4 billion mark.  With likely cheaper operational costs as its a mobile game 
---
Honestly the most amazing part is ncsoft continuing any support for this game considering their habit of just canning projects once they become irrelevant.
---
I think you confuse reddit for gw2 pvp.
---
&gt;So you're going into this argument by going off on what they clearly lied about
---
No, I am basing my own opinion of things on statements from the company that develops the game.
---
&gt;I'm not defending how they advertise this season but it sounds like you just want a new expansion.
---
Of course I do, and I expected to get a similar experience from what they stated multiple times.
---
&gt;Complain about something that makes sense.
---
Yes, you get to tell me what makes sense and what not, lmao.
---
&gt;Obviously people want new things
---
yes, people have expectations, you are very smart.
---
&gt;Nice try though.
---
Nice catchphrase, where did you get it
---
That's as fast as your flick speed, there is no speed limit, it's moving your "cursor" from point A to point B in both cases.
---
In reality, an action reticle and a cursor are fundamentally the same (the reticle IS a cursor), the only difference is that your character follows the direction of your aiming, which is important in BDO because there are special mechanics when you're attacked from behind.
---
As opposed to what you may think, the difference isn't felt in ground targetted abilities  (and how fast you place them) since both cursor and reticles place them the same way (point and click).
---
The difference is in targetted attacks: with a GW2/old-MMO tab targetting system, you can just press "tab" and do abilities and the game will throw them at the ennemy for you. Whereas whith an action reticle you have to keep the reticle on target otherwise you'll just miss. Which makes things even harder on consoles since it becomes FPS like.
---
That's the reason why you have the illusion that it's "slow", in GW2 or other MMOs (like FFXIV too), since you "tab target", you have less things to do (you don't have to aim) so you can use abilities while already "pre-aim" or "pre locate the cursor" where you want to place an AoE since your cursor isn't used for anything else.
---
TLDR: it " looks limited and slow " because the old-MMO targetting style (likg GW2 and FFXIV) doesn't require constant aiming, so for the few times you do actually need to aim, you can do it it advance.
---
people in wow sell raid runs, people in pvp sell god of pvp title , does it mean nobody wants to get god of pvp title? , people sell food, does that mean nobody wants to eat? its a stupid argument
---
&gt;You asked for Elite specs from content that is no where near an Expansion and you QUIT
---
you didn't read properly.
---
Im baffled they decided that letting us go for most likely 3+ years without new toys was a good idea,like who does that????
---
No
---
It was sarcasm.
---
It's a general trend on western entertainment. Even the big flagships are going down, either because of low quality, political pandering, or incompetent visionaries. I mean, look at Star Wars, it's the epitome of everything wrong with the west.
---
Only eastern media is safe, for the moment. Anime is the only watchable thing nowadays if you have any taste for actual narrative structures. Hell, the script of any quarterly anime fanservice garbage is miles ahead of most Hollywood superproductions. That's how bad it is.
---
I don't think I've enjoyed a modern game since 10+ years ago; not counting indies, of course; though they aren't safe from trash either (see incompetent visionaries above, though in this case lack of resources is to blame most of the time).
---
I don't know, I barely play games anymore. I got into gaming right in the modding era. For fuck's sake, I learned programming by building maps for Warcraft III as a kid. We went from a decade of originality to a decade of pure trash. And monetized to the extreme, to spit on the corpse. It's depressing.
---
Most of the threads where people are leaving the company, people want to avoid talking bad about them. It's just not really the right place. That said, Chris Cleary's cocky behavior on Twitter while constantly fucking up banwaves means that I don't think that sentiment applies to him. He's definitely generated a lot of ill will by talking shit on Twitter after falsely banning people.
---
Imagine everyone being at the same level as me; skill, experience, efficiency, and intellect - now they're all my clones.
---
I am always justified to be toxic to people who do not meet my standards and aren't my clone - that's your logic.
---
Don't take out a gun and shoot someone in the face over a disagreement or difference in opinion? 'Murica would disagree.
---
I don't need to be sarcastic, it's how it works in 99% of shareholder-based companies.
---
It wouldn't happen so often it developers grew a fucking spine now and then.
---
this is simply about human nature and it has nothing to do with gw2 at all
---
whenever there is something at stake, people become more toxic! this obviously happens more often in competitive modes but you can even see it in open world, like in dragonfall meta when the champs aren't killed correctly or whatever
---
wvw and pvp are dead cuz anet slowly killed them, not because of some randoms being rude to others! you can just disable chat and go invisible and do your own thing, like cmon stop it with this bullshit meme already..same for instanced pve!
---
&gt; even though they won't touch PvP or WvW unless they wanna make a legendary
---
yea cuz they don't enjoy the modes? you talk like they're interchangeable, which is an extremely delusional stance
---
it's almost as delusional as believing it's player behavior that kills the game, when in fact it's anet not giving a single fuck and not caring about said players' experiences
---
**tl;dr** this self-fulfilling prophecy bullshit that became so popular on this subreddit lately is just a big joke! it's not the players fault nor their job to fix the game with some vague concept of unity and positive thinking
---
no?
---
Technically correct, however Anet management decided long ago to pull more and more devs from GW2 to do side projects, this caused GW2 to be ignored and made a massive content drought, eventually NCSoft moved in and basically said, why are we funding this, and pulled the plug on it, hence the massive layoffs last year, which eventually lead to Mike O'Brien leaving also.
---
It makes sense for a company to have more than 1 game/product, but to completely sacrifice the game that is keeping the $$$ coming in, for a project with no name was a bad bad bad management decision, and Anet has never really recovered from that.
---
But that isnt what always happens, ive seen plenty of constructive feedback that goes ignored, its more a PR stunt from Anet at this point, its yea we want your feedback in this one big thread that we will lock after a week, and they just ignore it all, its been done several times in the past via the official forums, the only time they pay attention is when the backlash is that harsh that its picked up by 3rd party websites, then its like they are forced to acknowledge the problem.
---
They dont really ever want your feedback, it just looks good for them when they ask for it, so they can say we are listening.
---
Of course not. But there's some bare minimums.
---
In the case of Guild Wars 2, the bare minimums in open world are extremely minimal. 
---
If an open world encounter fails when there's enough people around to complete it, by now it only means they failed on purpose. Maybe to farm a failing event or something of the sort. 
---
That is not ok, as it ruins other players' fun.
---
Problem here is Anet never really communicated, they just ignored so people got more and more detached to a point that when a dev did reply they got jumped on, you cant ignore the playerbase you rely on to play your game for months on end and expect a happy dance when you finally show up, when NCSoft took over Anet again recently, they should have made it a priority to communicate better, as it stands the game is losing players daily that wont come back no matter what ( im very nearly there myself ) because they just get ignored.
---
I'd actually grade how the game is doing by the ammount and quality of proper content they do and to be frank, Anet dropped PvP and WvW while any serious PvE was left behind with 5th raid wing.
---
Not being charged for a season pass is actually bad if you ask me. Season passes in other games present a promise/obligation to deliver more content to playerbase in exchange for what ever the pass is worth. For example Destiny 2 has weapon quests, story, new replayable areas challenges, traits, classes overhauls, progression and extra rewards for player that buy 10‚Ç¨ Season Pass. Arena net right now doesnt seem to be producing any quality replayable content and if they truly had something good to show they would pack it into either expansion or a pass.  The plan seems to be "prolongue the story for as much as possible and sell Gemstore skins while at it".
---
This.
---
You will eventually realize anyway that you don't deal enough DPS to even necros and will start swapping out marauders pieces for berzerker. In GW2's PvP survival depends on active defensive skills (invulns, blocks, dodges, distortion and to a lesser extent protection, cleanses and heals) not on how much damage your gear can absorb.
---
Copperfed was so good before shared inventory slots (and being a alt'aholic) I kept it in the first slot in my bank. First thing I did after logging on a character was pulling that into my inventory.
---
Now that shared inventory slots are a thing, it's not a problem. But if you are new and reading this, the copperfed is honestly the best investment you can make in the game.
---
More should see your post and the community needs more teachers like you
---
Does anet even have any interest left in GW2?
---
If you count Quiznos, a chain that like the game, is dying.
---
As a casual player, WvW portrays itself as pointless to me. You conquer something, ten minutes later you lose it. Isn't it pointless? Personal glory? What's that? If they introduced something like Tarir with layers of defence (one guild initiates a defence, gets matched with a guild looking to conquer). You win or lose in steps, regroup, go again. Not just two concentrated masses colliding, break the groups. Heck, tie in the actual guild halls/resources they can generate (if you hold more than your primary hall, you can queue to defend one of your auxiliaries, reward increased production for that hall or something. If you lose your only hall, go claim and build up a new one). Or something.
---
They can still leverage the remaining playerbase, and who knows, eventually resume growth. But if they want to do anything new with PvP, they need to hurry. I can participate, but I have no desire to try to lead this stuff. At this rate the best they can populate is going to be something like world boss clashes with two supporting factions (still cool in my books, but balancing those in the open world would get artificial quick, nullifying whole point of PvP with a swift snap). Tying the future PvP with guilds would at least allow relatively fair matchmaking.
---
But what do I know. All I care about is making a quick buck to fund my drinks for the night.
---
Yikes. I have 2 Christmas cards from ANET and they were fun, and endearing. 
---
This is just corporate coldness and hardly even ANET or GW branded. Looks like NCSoft really has taken over.
---
I would be absolutely okay with GW3. After 3k hours, 6 Legendaries, 6 different toons. I am totally ready for a new game. I really only log on to do the dailies, even the stagnant holiday events don't keep me entertained anymore. I've exhausted a lot of things in GW2. I will however appreciate more game changing moves from Anet but at this point I will understand if they want to move on. I will be disappointed at the same time however. My suggestions for PVP is something they can try to do in its current state or even implement in the next game but we'll see.

&gt; Information is useful and knowing the numbers of the opposing zerg as well as who is leading them is the key to making good decisions before a fight occurs.
---
I agree that it is useful information. But getting this out-of-game by using accounts "on the other side" I consider pretty much cheating.
---
You need a new phone friend.

Should be open world, permanent and with more songs. Such a wasted minigame. They could even monetize it with new instruments, but hey, I guess ArenaNet hates money :(.
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
They also help organize post reset, and more often than not the tags and blockers at post are RnT members; however, it‚Äôs what they call a ‚Äúcommunity slot‚Äù which means anyone can lead a wurm or be in defense squad.
---
The way WvW is played now is not the way it is best enjoyed. During the heyday of WvW you would see ~4-7 guild groups running around on a BL. These groups would independently look for fights, capture structures, and defend their owned structures. The combat becomes much more engaging in WvW when you don't have 10 other people doing the same job as you.
---
Now it seems you just run around in a circle capturing things and not defending and that's if you have someone with a commander tag at all. Whenever I'm in WvW lately it seem like no one even bothers to tag up, people just kind of run around randomly.
---
I agree with you that having some sort of pseudo open world PvP would be excellent. If you had to PvP to get something expensive or powerful, it's a really good motivator to drive people towards the content.
---
Release Manager here and agree. I'm usually looking after 2-3 years, give or take on if it's a good company, work/life balance, environment, etc. I've never gotten any worthwhile raises staying put (1-2% at best). Meanwhile going to a new job is usually at least a 15% raise. Lowers a bit as you get closer to the high-end of the field.
---
I upvoted just cause I laugh so hard xD
---
HoT is always relevant primarily for gen 2 legendaries. You will see all meta being played in each of the 4 maps. You just have to be vigilant with keeping track of Event Timers provided through the GW2 wiki and keep track of LFG so that you are in a populated map. Heart of Thorns is one of the best things Anet has done thus far. Path of Fire will provide you mounts but you will always have reason to revisit the HoT maps. Don't get discouraged with the current state of content development. Focus on doing what's fun for now. Everyone here has done everything the game has to currently offer and are starved for more immediate content because they don't play anything else. Anet is arguably slow at the moment.
---
The entire game's reward system is shit you'll get blues greens yellows and exotics anywhere. Since you're new you'd want ascended gear do what you can to get it even if its not the stat you want you can change that with the mystic forge. Achievement points are worth getting if you plan on playing long term but not needed.
---
Want a surprise? Most of them also worked in GW1 and developed the ORIGINAL GW2! Pretty much all the original devs of the GW franchise left. GW2's falldown goes deeper than "lel some ppl ruined it".
---
This reant could be copied and pasted from literally every MMO out on the market right now.   
---
Why is that? Couldn't be the genre - could it? (Hint: It's totally the genre)
---
there is no such file for me there...
---
any way to toggle or disable the device/driver/fps overlay?
---
Freaking eh, that ancient line just spam played in my mind lol
---
Also, there's not much to skip, just the regular straightforward story path which should lead you to all the available maps. Its up to you if you want to grind the Meta events that happen in each 4 maps, just know the gen 2 legendaries have a LOT of steps but are very rewarding.
---
Content in this game doesn't get outdated.
---
Even level 1 content is relevant.
---
Your comment made me realize something. There's an even worse fate, one we've seen happen with other companies and franchises:
---
**Eventually, ArenaNet will kill GW2 on purpose, so players move into the new game.**
---
And by killing I don't mean leaving GW2 in support mode, I mean *ruining it on purpose* so players quit, and leave for the closest alternative, offered by ArenaNet themselves.
---
I saw this happen with Blizzard. After years of abandon, they decided to patch Warcraft III, adding a few improvements, but ruining a big part of the custom map experience for a lot of people. Right before StarCraft 2's release, which came with a brand new map editor (and mod monetization talks).
---
So yeah, don't be surprised. I've seen worse.
---
Remember: Corporations aren't your friends.
---
ayy lmao
---
&gt; though it probably is the most important thing in life for most people here which is why they so vehemently oppose anyone who speaks otherwise.
---
And then you have out most "respected" artists making comics about how we supposedly call White Knights people who have a possitive opinion on the game or have just joined with a friend when a quick search reveals the contrary... I mean, people who just come to the game have their questions answered and are even told "This game is good for new players".
---
What GS skin is that?
---
I found a good way to get my personal fractal level up was look for the daily recommended fractals. There was always one in the 1-25 range, one in 26-50, and one in 51-75. Use them to level up. If there is a daily level 46 fractal, and your personal level is lower then that you can keep running that daily 46 until your personal level is 46. It really helps to play around reset time, if you are able to, as that is when the most groups are running. Keep joining groups doing the recommended dailies. 
---
With lower level fractals you don't need a full group either (if you know how to keep yourself alive). There are even fractals that you can solo, and I believe mesmer is one of the most solo friendly classes. You can keep running some of the solo friendly fractals over to increase your level as well, but it will take longer without a group.
---
New World will be a nice wake up call for a lot of people here.
---
At least those not in absolute denial, that is.

I was happy on WSR but by the time I was home from work the queue for eb could be 50+ recently. Something to consider with both servers at the moment I think. But both have good players and good commanders and a fight ethic which is healthy for the game. But like another commenter said - relink soon could change things up a bit. Hopping between links could be an option as its often a cheap transfer and you can try out different servers to see what suits. I also noticed while on WSR that some servers will avoid blobs from WSR and deso likely too. I've found in tier 2 theres more 3 way blob action - perhaps not the same quality but it's still fun. Just food for thought ofcourse. Did spend a while just chasing ppt groups map hopping because they wouldn't fight which isn't all that great

Let it go

The way to write it here i make it seem like its achievable to not have ppl bitch. What i mean is that we've always had a sizable portion of the online community disatisfied with the state of the game.

Other games have had phases were even despite some issues the games were overall really solid and mpst ppl agreed. Thats what i havent seen in my time playing gw2.
