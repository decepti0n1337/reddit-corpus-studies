Do you want to experience the story or the rewards?
---

---
If you want the rewards the S2 is worth for Mawdrey but that’s pretty much it IMO.
---
S3 maps are however my personal favorites, so many new things, I loved the stories and discovering a new map every now and then!

I wasn't saying LA was a racial activity. I was saying it was pretty obvious they wanted to funnel players to LA for mid to end game. Also I agree on your second paragraph but from a utilitarian standpoint racial capitals being that massive was a waste of development time. Development time they could of used on actual end game content which gw2 lacked for the first 6 months after launch wich isn't okay for a pve focused MMO to launch like that.
---
if half the people like the former and the other half like the latter. Than that's overall a good thing.

Once you have the application in in \~/Applications, you can stop the client and move the app to any place you'd like.  Restarting the client will continue the down for the data and it will be where the application lives.  That said, this game loads a lot of data on map changes.  If your main drive is an SSD, an external drive will be noticeably slower on loading times unless it's something like a Thunderbolt drive with an SSD.
---
Today I was surprised at myself for trying it again. Fair enough, I was using my mesmer for portal backups, but I didn't fall many times. I think I fell twice. I actually did it legitimately.
---
Which isn't surprising it ended up like that because they funneld everyone to LA. Also if you looked at other popular mmos at the time of launch and now like WoW for example. Every racial capitol is pretty much empty except one city every player congregated to. Time they spent on it could of been used on more end game content which the game launched without any.
---
what would you recommend for getting armor sets quick then? i don't really have enough gold or time to grind in order to get 1000s of gold at the moment, but i need to gear a firebrand (minstrels, zerkers, vipers) and gear a holosmith (zerkers and at least another set iirc)
---
So what happened exactly?
---
He was probably one of the more enjoyable gw2 streamers to watch.
---
This is about loot boxes, not pay to win mechanics.
---
Eh social media sites call just about everything "hate speech" anymore
---
Right. What you're saying is you think that a city that's functional is the main point of playing an MMO ignoring those who play for flavor and immersion. I don't really care what city most people spend their time in. I care about what time I choose to spend my time in. I don't spend most of my time in Lion's Arch.  With the exception of the mystic forge, and I have a portable forge anyway, I only go to LA for jumping puzzles. Rata Sum is a more convenient city anyway, if you talk about bank/trading post closeness.
---
I'm not saying they shouldnt exist but they made each one fully functioning players hubs. When they could of just added buildings and npcs with a few RP spots and moved on since its clesr they wanted most of the player base in LA because story content funneled everyone there and made all the banks and crafting location close to each other. They knew that players would congregate there they planned for it.

Why do you feel that the moral integrity of rich people in business is somehow worse than the moral integrity of rich people in the government?  I mean, the second group actually has the power to impact your life in a profound way, yet you don't even give them the same level of skepticism as you do corporations?
---
Also, you read the article, right?  You know *which* senator introduced this bill?
---
This is how MMOs used to work. There used to be multiple large cities, with one of them being the place the high level places where.
---
It's good for world building. If there's only one proper city in the game, it makes the whole thing feel shallow. I also highly doubt the designing of these cities took that much time away from other content.
---
This is my favorite place in the whole game

Comment? Unoriginal and Overused

So I actually got something like this working a while back using the demo version of TriDef3D and Virtual Desktop with actual depth. The company that makes TriDef went out of business though, and the activation server for existing owners doesn't work anymore. VorpX is the next best bet iirc.
---
TriDef was perfect. The Re-Shade plugins kind of work but you get REALLY weird depth warping and it made me want to throw up.
---
Kind of wish depth-mapping a game into stereoscopic 3D were a built-in feature in Virtual Desktop or Bigscreen.
---
Why are you blanketing what is clearly two opposing groups of people within the Guild Wars 2 community as the eternity of the group. When people have a problem with something, they'll speak out against it. However, more often than not, if they don't have a problem with something, they won't speak up. At least that's been the trend within internet culture over the last decade or so.
---
If you want easy HP's for elite specs after hitting 80, find a HP train in LFG for Verdant Brink. There are a regular few with names like "Squad For HP Train" who run groups every couple days which get you 330 points, enough for 1 full elite spec.
---
It makes too much sense though.  Have a couple of story instances playable as 5mans for replayability and keep the story mode as is so solo players can get through as well.
---
I use the tomes to get my other characters there.
---
I for one certainly do not wish to get fucked in the ass. I'll just continue avoiding world bosses like I usually do.
---
You’re correct. I don’t know why I thought Sylvan. :)
---
This is the problem with getting the government involved in games. Government regulation is a blunt object used to imprecisely bash at a problem that may need a more finessed approach. Plus it could open up the door for legal precedent, where could theoretically start regulating game content rather than just monetization.
---
To answer the question, though... Ideally they'd just look at the content of the game and make a determination for the intended audience. Stuff like the lego games and etc are clearly meant to be games primarily for and marketed at kids. The issue comes in with "suitable for all ages" type games that aren't primarily marketed or intended for kids, but get an "E for Everyone" rating, like the recent Crash Bandicoot and Spyro remakes.
---
GRIFFITH!
---
aka you're bad at it and dismissing it is easier
---
You can't just say things like that on the internet.
---
If a restaurant shits in your food but it tastes good you don't have to go back. You know it's shit. You dont need government to stop them. Make them go out of business. Hell they might even change their way.

I believe he was well known in the tournament scene back in the day, and for reaching pretty high levels in ranked sPvP.
---
though, it was thought he didn't necessary use the most honorable methods to achieve this... not quite sure about that one, might just be a rumor mill discussion I came across once.
---
&gt;due to the way downscaling works, level 80 players will forever be able to just steamroll through low level content.
---
I definitely think downscaling needs to be improved. Badly.
---
One solution for things like world bosses or meta events would be to upscale players and enemies to level 80. 
---
They could even have flavor text similar to Eye of the North in GW1 like "What you do not have in experience you make up with courage. Your level is temporarily scaled to 80 while you fight an epic challenge."
---
Obviously this might be jarring if you're just wandering Lornar's Pass and you get scaled up to 80 all of a sudden. But what they can do is draw inspiration from the Rifts recently added by Current Events Team, where you're teleported to a boss area. The boss area doesn't even have to be a separate map. It could even be an underground area below the map, similar to Breach in Silverwastes.
---
It's not exactly the same
---
The main guides out there are dynamic. They go off the cheapest way get get from point a to point b, at the moment you view the content. If runes or sigils are expensive, then it wont even suggest them.

Twitch is pretty clear in its guidelines and I'm not personally aware of any times they banned someone for hate speech when it wasn't. Are there instances of it happening somewhere in not aware of?
---
People forget that you don’t have to be “doing something” constantly to have fun. In fact it leaves little room for fun when you just grind. World bosses can be a reminder to breath and enjoy the game without feeling like you have to rush around all the time. Slow down and you might find you’re having more fun even though you’re technically achieving less or making less gold.
---
To be fair if any of those convenience items paid for themselves too quickly then the game starts sliding towards pay to win. They are supposed to be convenient, not economical.

I feel that the people that want to do the jp will do it despite the ports. I did the jp while a random newbie followed my lead. We never spoke a word to each other heh.

poor man legendary for 3k gold,thx. no trail on blade,some dumb stones as *effect* footprints are joke,offhand weapons have longer animation. btw ppl who actualy liking this,you understand what LEGENDARY means right? its suposed to be "OH MY GOD   WTF IS THAT? I NEEEEEED IT !!!" kind of stuff,this is like  "OH MY GOD YOU SPEND 3K GOLD? ON THIS?"
---
Apparently. Based on posts, people were expecting the chances of getting at least one infusion during the first day.
---
"Chipotle Mexican Grill"
---
&gt;Pretty much noone really expected to have a fair chance of infusions
---
The complaints I've seen say otherwise. Sounds like a **lot** of people expected at least one infusion after a "full" day of running world bosses.
---
jokes on you! you have to go back to it to get achievement! so technically i used it twice! aha!
---
Sylvan is (infrequently) an adjective. Singular and plural is indeed sylvari.

extreme homophobic remarks

This sounds like fun! I just got done with school so I would be down to play. Those evenings work for me. Just let me know time, my time zone is different though
---
You have to imagine that too.
---
That's a joke right?
---
It's been long enough now that you are very unlikely to be banned, as almost all fraud is caught within a month.  Nothing to be done about it now, except only buying from official sources going forward.

I wouldn't worry about it and just enjoy the game.

Lol, way to rub it in Tybalt.

Spoken like someone could review a movie based on the title card.

That sounds fun, i love jumping puzzles and think I'm okay at them, but i get really discouraged when you die on them and have to get back to the area to start all over. Thinking of darkdream enclave, not so secret... i usually do the daily jps by myself, but i admit the portals can be very alluring, especially when there is less then an hour left.

Isn’t there a tab for preview all available gear in bank? Like last tab or something

I feel you. I think the soonest i would start this is next week. What kind of times would work for you on Thursday/Friday?
---
Not all of their suggestions are awesome, especially on the forums. This one happens to be pretty cool tho :)
---
can you go more in details about the first 2...im curious...
---
There are both welcoming and unwelcome players on every game, every forum and every reddit sub. Players from this sub have gone through ups and downs lately, and have encountered hundreds of these threads since 80 boosts came out. 
---
Don’t take it too harshly is all I’m saying.
---
Past that, Welcome to the game! I see you’ve gotten great advice. I’d also recommend you watch some YouTube videos. Sub to WoodenPotatoes. There’s so much great content that people pass over these days. 
---
When you’re ready, check out PvP. It has a bad rap with PvE players, but it is pretty awesome. Better than combat on any other game I’ve played. Whereas in PvE I personally feel strangely overpowered, underpowered, super meaningful and useless, I feel crucial in PvP games. 
---
Good luck out there, fellow Tyrian.
---
The skin the wiki is referring to is the Glorious Hero set which you can only get through winning tournaments. You either need those skins or the Ardent set to buy the Mistforged set.

But I want a REAL wardrobe system. Show me infusions. Legendaries. All the shinies!! 
---
Let’s get crazy - what if there were even “suggested looks” or “popular combinations”???
---
I’m a noob. I see things and think WHOA WHAT IS THAT? I NEED IT! Anet needs to play to that strength somehow.
---
Guys, it took me two weeks to figure out what infusions were. Probably because I’m dumb. But still.
---
The customization options in this game are INCREDIBLE and I just want Anet to help noobs see what’s out there. It will inspire us to keep playin 🖤
---
more like fph (frame per hour)

You are &gt;!America’s ass! !&lt; lol

Shameless plug.

I loved the ghosts of Ascalon. I just wish they did more with the characters ingame too. such as Dougal I know they placed him LA but it feels like they could have done more.
---
“Bugged NPC.Caption this.”
---
I've seen him there but not often enough to know if theres a specific cycle of when he appears.
---
I haven't seen anyone say that. Can you send us some links?
---
Ehhh I cant be bothered anymore, they were cool when I first started, and if I haven't done one I do it. But for a daily? I'd rather just get ported than have to restart cause I accidentally pressed W too soon and rolled, or slightly missed the pixel and slid off. It's not that fun repeatable content, at least for me
---
tangled depths, its has the most depth... and best meta before it was nerfed to the ground
---
I assumed he meant guild halls.
---
#8 looks real pretty, yeah
---
No one's said that explicitly. But a lot of people complained *on the first day of the event* of not getting a single infusion.
---
You can find a few fairly easily just by looking through [this thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/909229#Comment_909229) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bln1l5/chris_cleary_on_world_boss_week_rewards/)
---
This...OMG I want this now so badly. Imagine if they thru in something like a Sim builder or DQ builder option just for the housing, some of the stuff people would come up with. Not to mention it would open up a whole new section for the gem store, or certain pieces of furniture/decoration could only be obtained by doing fractals or WvW.
---
Timberline Falls, feels cozy
---
This would definitely be a dev question tbh
---
Check out r/GuildWarsDyeJob and gw2style.com for inspiration if you haven't already.
---
Well there are four versions: Glorious, Ardent Glorious, Glorious Hero's, and Mistforged.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Glorious Hero's armor is a special version obtained from PVP tournaments. If you have Glorious armor from the reward track, you'll still need to get Ardent Glorious first, or win Glorious Hero's from an automated tournament.
---
Try disabling adblock and similar addons on the entire site. Worked for me, had the same issue previously.
---
And castlevania has been a series since 1986. What's your point?
---
C'mon... A GOP senator would never discourage pay-to-win.
---
thanks, but do you happen to know if its another wardrobe skin or the same as ardent? The wardrobe only shows me 3 skins
---
It's different than Ardent, just a little bit shinier on the little details. Must be hidden, a few things are hidden in wardrobe.
---
Well that depends. No , we don't think that. And in fact , Anet already has addressed this issue. Players in Belgium are blocked from buying keys or getting BL chests , cause they are lootboxes , and illegal there. So this has ALREADY been addressed. But since it is mostly a NA / EU focused game , if the USA banned lootboxes they might : either block out lootboxes only in the USA , same as they did in Belgium. OR , do a rework so that the majority of the game is on the same page , design-wise.
---
The new LS armor set
---
&gt; has been used before in state regulation before such as the prohibition of schedule 1 drugs and during the Prohibition Era. 
---
These paternalistic arguments have been soundly rejected by the people, and despite the claims of morality and ethics, they are in fact not moral.  The state has a moral obligation to allow people to make their own choices, even if they're bad ones, provided they do not harm others.
---
&gt; They are blatantly anti-consumer and a cash grab
---
This is not a reason to pass federal legislation.  If I dislike them, I will avoid them.  If I feel the practice is harmful or anti-consumer, I will avoid commerce with the publisher (EA, for example).
---
What I will NOT do is impose my preferences upon you.  THAT is the problem I have with it.
---
My impression from reading the latest 5 or so pages from the first thread is that people are complaining about the value of the contents of the box being too little for the effort.
---
Many people brought up how they could introduce a ticket-style system like the one in place with black lion statuettes, where there's a visible goal you can see yourself working towards instead of blindly hoping with each box to get an infusion. I personally don't think that system would work with the infusions, as I agree that they're supposed to be really rare, and any amount of tickets you'd need to purchase one would (and should) be astronomical. Maybe some other reward such as skins or exotics or something else could be redeemed.
---
There are also many people saying that the reward of the rare unidentified gear feels "invisible" the normal rewards unnoticeable, that they'd only got some basic materials, and that they'd rather have T6 mats. A lot a lot a lot of people were wanting T6 mats. Chris Cleary responded to this later in the thread saying that the rare unidentified gear is guaranteed, and I think that that is somewhat comparable to a T6 mat.
---
Someone wanted a complete revamp to the infusion system with some suggestion about buying something extra to add on to it in the gemstore? (confusing. unsure)
---
A few people wanted some unique, visible reward you can slowly see yourself working towards like a title.
---
A group of people wished the 0.000000000001% chance of getting the infusion would be changed to 0.00000000001% for the duration of the event.
---
Some quotes from the thread:
---
&gt;"too much garbage in the drop tables
---
&gt;1 ore, 1 wood and 1 cloth in one chest.
---
&gt;I was just hoping for a few t6s ... opened 10, got 0.
---
&gt;For an individual there is simply no reason to try because the chances to get a super rare items are non-existent and there is nothing else worth the time.
---
Even T6 mats are too rare.
---
&gt;I was looking forward to the boss week event and the loot is fine. As others have pointed out, making the rare loot more common robs it of what makes it desirable. 
---
&gt;@HardRider.2980 said:
---
"People are just upset they aren't getting the Super duppa ultra rare mega gold infusions."
---
&gt; response: no. read the thread again. no one here complains sbout the infusion droprate at all.
---
Its about the rest that is in that chest.
---
&gt;And no, I didn't expect a very rare drop from 9 kills, like some kind of infusion. But to be honest, I wouldn't expect such a drop from 3000 of these boxes. You don't farm for these items, that's like farming the mushroom to get invisible shoes, which drop maybe once every 20.000th kill. I expected a little bit more exciting materials to come out of these boxes. I regularly get Deldrimor Steel or Elonian Leather Squares from playing WvW and Tier 6 mats.
---
&gt;"People are just upset they aren't getting the Super duppa ultra rare mega gold infusions."
---
&gt;response: I'm not. Please don't speak for others. I'm disappointed -- not upset; this is only a game -- that the rewards seem lackluster for something advertised as a "special event." Doesn't seem special. YMMV
---
It feels like people are more complaining that the content of the boxes feels worthless, as you get around four extra rares per hour, and that's just not worth the effort when compared to other farms. 
---
I feel like people are taking the complaining about the rewards as complaining that the infusions aren't common, when that just isn't the case. The content of the boxes is very much "feast or famine", which I saw one or two people mention, in that you either get the infusion (which people agreed was going to be really rare outside of one person before the event started saying that the massive influx of infusions would be too much) or you waste your time.
---
Does it have a name?
---
#1 : Of course they're only "on par" . The boost gear is exotic. Which is the 2nd best gear tier in terms of stats. Ascended is better , but events don't just pass it out like candy.
---
#2 : Yes HOT is very difficult to navigate. Updrafts and endless gliding is very necessary, and a mounts help too. But many players still dislike HOT maps because of how annoying they are to navigate.
---
#3: Incentral tyria masteries, get auto loot as soon as possible. if you are gonna do fractals, do the fractal ones asap also.
---
 In HOT , get updrafts, and endless gliding and bouncing mushrooms. Then its whatever sounds useful . unlocking the vendors is good. In POF , get the first 4 mounts and train Raptor to 3 , springer to 3, get skimmer but leave at 0, jackal to 3, then skimmer 3. then eventually get a griffon

---
Probably have to ask one of the 12 people who were watching him.
---
If the drop rate was even as high as 1% thousands would be added to the market, the price would crash and they would become useless. It's not even as high as 0.1%. For regular events it's accepted to be about 0.01% (or one in ten thousand). For this event I'd suggest it's lower still since they can all drop, people can farm it brainlessly, and it's not limited to one meta a day.
---
So I'd say one in a hundred thousand kills will drop one infusion. ie. Even if you farmed 100,000 world bosses (impossible for one person) it's still not a gaurentee.
---
You need to reason these things out, since Anet has always been shady as fuck about telling you the odds, do your own research and figure out if it's worth it for you. I mean sure if you enjoy the bosses but don't force yourself. You are basically not going to get one.
---
BTW how good is the loot? I decided I'll wait for War Eternal but are these worth the time and effort?
---
Debatable.. medium pvp is way better imo
---
If you want to get 3600 ascended shards in the absolute minimum number of games, you should stop at Persimmon each season. It will take 16 seasons to get 3600 shards.
---
The Caithe art looks so... Weird... It's not a bad piece but it's just dissimilar to most other Guild Wars 2 pieces.
---
Were you the person that kept asking about this in bitterfrost frontier over and over again?
---
When you throw price tags onto that stuff, consider that the mount skin lootboxes are already literally $15 worth of gems in order to choose a single mount skin from a pack.
---
The Suntouched Scythe, to think of a gemstore weapon skin, is $7.5 worth of gems.

&gt; the government has now power of authority that doesn't derive from us

As an American citizen in good legal standing, I hereby grant the American Government the power to prohibit lootboxes from being a monetization source in games that are not rated Adults Only, in the hopes that the companies affected by this will be forced to find a less exploitative way of funding their operations.

I think one of the reasons I was getting burnt out was the gear tredmil. I like the idea of it, but I think not having it will be a benefit for me in the long run. I like making characters and experiencing the story from different races and such. Sure I wanna get to level 80 and start working on getting into the end game but I'm not going into this game with the mindset of "I need BiS asap" like I have with others
---
Good thing that they didn't; when has an MMO trying to go all eSporty ever ended well, or any other way except in wasted money?
---
I'm a relatively new player (less than a year) and I'm glued to gw2 everyday. I play a minimum of 5 hours. It has a great community. Recently I joined a guild and I think the people there are awesome. They are very helpful &amp; extremely friendly. Glad I picked up this game. It's my first MMORPG &amp; will be the only one for a long time.
---
Way more than several months ago he quit. Only played casually after PoF. It wasn't really a "noisy" quit as you call it and I don't recall there ever being drama as you imply. 
---
Yes he quit because the pro scene in gw2 was completely dead thanks to a lack of effort or proper balance on anets part at the time. This is not something he alone felt, it's the consensus among many veteran players who are still playing or have quit for the same reason.
---
If you are a "pro gamer" who looks to play games competitively then ofcourse you would quit once the pro scene is gone. Other than quitting because of the pro scene he also talks about his successes with his job as that is a large focus of life now.

How the initiative from the US have any consequence for EU market? Unless your argument is "they change laws in US so Anet will leave Portugal".
---
&gt;Then the content drought starts since theres no expansion in sight.
---
Except for the fact that we're going into Season 5. I guess every LW season has been a "content drought" in your and so many other complainers' eyes though.
---
but it's 16 seasons. Around 2-3 years of minimal PvP.  
---
All in all I think it depends on if you do enjoy the PvP content or not.
---
Probably the hardest part about Necro is getting groups who will let you bring it into raids and fractals.
---
its more like 6-7h of active gameplay (if even) and the rest is downtime where he can do other stuff...
---
Yeah, would have been far better if they had showcased a non-mesmer for this teaser, since we already had two/three animations shown for mesmer skills. And now we have a couple more + walking, instead of say, warrior GS skills.

Omg a corrupted tombs a la GW1 would be amazing! Is Menzies still around?

&gt; Meanwhile, myself and many others are sick to death of being exploited and subjected to predation at the hands of game developers and publishers.
---
Then stop fucking participating.  It's as simple as that.  No law is necessary, no threat of force or violence, and no infringement upon me.  
---
You do not need the government to pass a law for you to stop supporting the lootbox model *right now*.  Today.
---
You only need the government to get involved to compel others to agree with you, and that is morally repugnant. 
---
Leave others to make their own choices.
---
Advocate for your position.  Explain to everyone who will listen why your position is the correct one.  Hire billboards and write online articles about it.  Convince me to make the same choice as you, but DO NOT USE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE TO DO IT.
---
Life in a free society requires that you allow other people to make their own choices.  Even if you think they're wrong.

msi meg godlike z390 motherboard, 64 gb(16x4) trident z royal ram, i7 8700k cpu, gtx 1080 gpu, thermaltake 750w power supply, cosmos c700m case, corsair 360mm aio(all in one) water-cooler plus some corsair ll120 case fans,  the main thing to worry about is cost, size of the parts to make sure they fit in the case, that the cpu is supported by the motherboard, and power of the power supply( you can use calculators online).  after that its just fluff and peripherals.
---
Owch!
---
I miss dashing around with tripp, great game hope to see something of the style re emerge.
---
&gt;&gt;What was the point? the people who worked for the store didnt hear you?
---
&gt;Exactly my point, you don't complain outside the store (or on Reddit), you complain inside the store (on Anet's forums were devs's DO read posts).
---
I was trying to point out that you discuss "negative" things outside the store all the time lol. There are many benefits to be gained from this. You maybe notice that you arent the only one who has realised this problem, maybe you figure out together the precise exact nature of the problem, maybe even you come up with suggestions to fix the problem and maybe then you take it to the store even. Oh also some of your friends might have workarounds to the problem that you didnt realise yourself. 
---
You can gain much from all kinds of discussion, even negative ones. You should give it a shot! and not manage where things should be discussed. Just join in! disagree or agree, but give your own input and read a few others.
---
If you want tips or somebody to guide you to learning how to do it i would love to help!
---
Good post. I think one other thing to mention is that all progress is cumulative. So every game you play is a tiny little bit towards that reward. Don't want to play to death? Don't. Just play enough for what you enjoy. Pvp should be about fun. And OP is talking about the full armour set. Along the way you'll have crafted some of the pieces, and you get the benefit of those immediately. One seasons to Byzantium plus two repeats of the final cheat gets you shoes or shoulders, for example.
---
The most expensive is the cheat piece at 400 shards. But you could just get three chest pieces for each weight as your goal and rely on, for example, the much more frequent fractal drops for shoulders boots etc. Mix and match to your appetite! :)
---
Good news! This release introduces crystal armor sets for all weights!
---
And there's always the Glacial Gauntlets of S3E3, the Herald shoulder piece, and a few other things you can mix in.
---
I've got rank 100 yesterday and bought the set, so it does work, it was 2400 Ascended shards of glory overall because i didn't have the Glorious Hero's skin unlocked. Wiki says that Ardent Glorious unlock is fine for it too, i don't know about that.
---
Just make it an infinite range skill, point blank : it's just 2 exordium and 1 bear. But at 2 500 units it's 8 exordiums and 7 bears
---
Racial cities are a useful mechanic for introducing new players to the lore and culture of that race. Going around and talking to every NPC and immersing yourself in the art/architecture is useful for establishing a cultural foundation for each race. Think of racial cities as cultural hubs where you can read up on lore and buy cultural gear. It's all for flavor and rp-value. This is an mmoRPg after all. Racial cities also break up the constant danger and combat of the outside world in the early leveling experience (since most towns outside can be taken over by a dynamic event).
---
LA doesn't provide as much lore or meaningful dialogue as it is meant to be the hub for player-to-player interactions, and it's a safe spot to break up medium to high leveling content. You can team up for fractals, or even competitive modes and raids, ask for help higher level leveling zones, gamble on ectos, suffer on that rooftop jumping puzzle, participate in community-organized festivals or Halloween, etc. There should only be one player central hub, one LA in a game (somewhat equidistant to all waypoints compared to any other city), and Anet intended this. Racial cities were never intended to compete with LA.
---
That’s a bit of a weird necro. Also that was before the Unid patch that disabled MF and enabled drops in Tyria
---
Oh awesome! Me too! If you decide to make it let me know. (Sunwave.4039)
---
They're probably hoping for a May 21st release but aren't sure if they'll make it so not announcing until they know for sure they can't make it.
---
If they were to announce the 28th "just to be safe" but then are able to make a 21st release, they wouldn't really be able to deliver it early without some idiots backlashing over lying or some stupid shit (yes, there would be people who will bitch about such a thing, I guarantee it).
---
Endgame was bad. They didn't even play a game in the trailer!
---
That "wooosh!" gives me tingles now.
---
What is the World Boss Rush Event that people keep mentioning in the subreddit as of lately?
---
[Gliding Disabled]
---
[Mounts Disabled]
---
[Mesmer Portals Disabled]
---
[Fun Disabled]
---
I wish they divided the holidays among the cities. A whole gauntlet event based on war and tribulations would have been perfect for the Black Citadel. There is potentially a new pvp/wvw holiday coming to the game, but that will probably be located in LA with all of its portals.
---
The [event mentioned here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-world-boss-beatdown/). World bosses don't have daily limits and there are very small chances at extra drops.
---
...the weapon effects?
---
Considering mount select licences ARE 15 atm... LOL, sure, I'llbuy one for 10
---
My problem is you don’t get to have the option of buying it.
---
If I want to buy something let me buy it otherwise it’s just obnoxious.
---
Reality is often disappointing.
---
Yup, and nothing is disabled int the NEtherlands.
---
Cause Belgium isn't in the Netherlands, genius.
---
They don't and I don't see anything wrong with it.
---
It is active for a few days already, and already had been written about. It's actually a 30% discount on the usual price (you get 20% off if you buy all episodes at once, which comes to 44% discount combined, and is the reason for the "odd" number). This is also, as already noted, a pretty good deal.
---
For completeness, someone in an earlier post about this topic noted that the sale might be a long-term one, according to claims of information from ANet about it. Take that with caution, like everything you read on the Inet and not directly from ANet.
---
Roses are gray,
---
Violets are gray, 
---
I am charr, 
---
Woof!
---
Don't you also need to be rank 100 to get the precursor armour?
---
Nope, the armor looks relatively the same, except for the shiny parts. Ardent has a purple ish look to it and the Hero version from tournaments has a bright blue ish look in them. So those are different wardrobe unlocks, but the Glorious Hero doesnt show in the wardrobe cause its a hidden skin.
---
Either of those is fine to unlock the rank 100 (mistforged skins) but ardent is easier since winning tournaments is relatively harder. Im not sure if normal Glorious armor skins unlock it.
---
Aetherblade Jumping puzzle and dive - Not So Secret is the worst but also most fun JP in gw2 and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise :P Anyone who ported through this will never know the agony of getting to the end only to fail the dive and have to do it all over again, best feeling when you actually complete it.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack
---
With this, you can put that soundtrack back as your character select!
---
HoT theme sounds awesome but you're right. I actually prefer PoF theme because it's more quiet for idling (I usually do it to save on buffs).
---
Oh I love the idea of a event currency for those types of short time events in PvE! This way, they can rotate the merchant tables and people can work torwards something specific.
---
Rewards could be like what they did with the SAB festival merchant: Mystic Coins, vouchers for map or dungeon currencies, legendary materials, crafting material boxes or special boss skins. Maybe even the infusions if they make them expensive enough?
---
thanks I needed that
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I already took some of the great advice. Started PoF campaign with a greatsword and sword/sword build from one of the sites the guys recommended (metasomething).
---
I still like the idea of re-lvling. So I'm gonna do that with my friend once we get the raptor, bunny and skimmer mounts. Maybe level them a bit too.
---
I'll try PvP for sure. I love the fast combat and quick weapon swapping. Reminds me of BDO.
---
Yup, same for me. I regret making Klaw of the Khan Ur so badly because it just does not feel like a legendary at all with the missing bladetrail.
---
&gt; Today I learned: making something illegal is literally the same as clubbing someone over the head.
---
&gt; 
---
Okay, let's game this out.
---
Me: You can't do that anymore, it's illegal
---
You: No, I'm gonna do it anyway
---
Me: You can't, I'll make you pay a fine
---
You: I won't pay it
---
Me: You have to, or I'll take your stuff
---
You: I won't give it to you.
---
Me: Then I'll put you into prison
---
You: I won't go
---
Me: Then I will send men with guns to make you do it under threat of force.
---
The only reason you use government to do anything rather than just saying the thing yourself is because you are using the implied threat of violence that the government, by definition, is.
---
Welp, no wonder most of my builds suck xd Thx for answering :)
---
I remember when these were on tumblr or some such. Loved on. Bookmarked. Thank you for sharing.
---
You mean to tell me you are a skritt?
---
Awesome.
---
Yup and don't you dare say anything the Borg doesn't agree with /s

For the future of build making/gear stats

---
The fact you think media calls “anything hate speech”? Yeah sure. Good luck defending that one, buddy.
---
Just goes to show how little people understand math and odds.
---
Can't complain too much though, as a native American idiots like those paid for my college
---
You won't lose your account permanently.
---
Worse they will do is ban your key, but not your account. You can buy a new, legit key, reapply it to your account and get back in
---
The solution to that is more elite specs being underwater viable.
---
That being said while it would be neat to have more weapons like this it would also mean exponentially more work for anet with each expansion
---
because it's not just about punishing bad parents, it's protecting children from predatory practises.
---
You don't pay much attention to the media or reality for that matter do you ?
---
Its gotten to the point where they call people bigots for advocating for merit instead of "being born as X" as well as asking for reason &amp; logic to be considered instead of feels.
---
But please do keep showing how off in la la land you are
---
Don't trample my liberties by attempting to infringe upon my right to petition my government to do something.
---
then who the fuck are they writing the story for? i've read childrens books that are better written and more interesting than this mess
---
But that's not experiencing, that's farming.
---
Yes. I also miss the vanilla one.
---
Super TLDR; Maximum of 2 pieces of armor per season (150 tickets each)
---
Definitely WvW has it harder. It has a weekly ticket limitation meaning (1 piece every 3 weeks). There are no seasons on wvw, so no downtime, but it definitely requires more dedication. Not to mention that there's a rank barrier of 2000 for the most wanted chest piece, which is a big barrier for new players (there's no such a barrier on pvp).
---
True, but at least I'm still having fun running things with so many people that my computer screams at me. It's like I'm back to gw2 core launch month.
---
You think it’s possible Exordium won’t have a blade trail? It’s hard to tell from the trailers so far but the throwing animation definitely doesn’t have one.
---
I feel the exact same way. Crit animation and projectile are epic but a blade without a blade trail just feels... lackluster
---
People like you are the reason why society can't move forward
---
Or you can just right click on the item and "add into the collection" or something like that. Yeah we all made these misstakes the first time we tryed it.
---
it looks like a f2p anime game tbh. not a fan of this graphics
---
Human Patron God adds some additional fluff to PoF dialogues.
---
&gt;cause I accidentally pressed W too soon and rolled
---
Always, *always*, **always** turn off double-tap to dodge. 
---
I can't really think of a single thing where double-tap to dodge is helpful, but it can legitimately get you killed or waste your dodge charges in a ton of different situations. I personally use V as my dodge key.
---
Overall I like JPs, they're fun and I like the jumping/puzzle nature.
---
Would it be a good idea to set up a JP guild, to help with the organisation of regular, community assisted, JPs. I like helping people out, and need to do some of the JPs myself as I've not got them all yet. I'd be up for joining a guild like that.
---
A friend and I have been vaguely planning on doing the Siren's Landing JP soon, as neither of us have done it before. If you do that one I'd hop in for sure.
---
no. the most expected more materials per chest.
---
Not a huge pvp fan but have to say the armor is one of the things that draws me in. The winged helmets and chest piece look pretty awesome
---
How is that any different to your glorious opinion of "It doesn't hurt *ME* so why should I give a fuck about anybody else?"   
---
If people legitimately thought like you we'd quite literally still be in the middle ages.
---
I just miss HoT
---
so whats new in this news?
---
We already know that, because they already told us.
---
&gt; laws advocated by people like you
---
You haven't been paying attention to this thread it appears.
---
&gt; where there's too much of them 
---
What?  The old chestnut of "overpopulation" wasn't true  100 years ago, it wasn't true 30 years ago, and it's not true now.
---
&gt; Sure, especially all those cunts who run away when they knock somebody up and those cunts who'd exercise that legal right to make life worse for the mother for whatever reasons not actually caring about the child.
---
So to be clear, you are advocating that the father have legal responsibility for the child, but have no say in if the child lives?  Doesn't that seem one-sided to you?
---
&gt; you'd still make decisions based on feelings instead of logic or prosperity.
---
Again, what?  There are at least three people involved in every pregnancy.  My position is that all three deserve to have their voice heard and their wishes advocated for.    
---
But scroll up.  I started this thread by saying that this particular issue is a very difficult one.  No simple solutions exist.
---
And what of those who have 1 parent working 2-3 jobs to even feed and clothe them? Or those who have non at all? Fuck them too right?   
---
*ADVOCATING PRO LIFE THEN SAYING "IDGAF ABOUT THOSE KIDS THEY HAVE PARENTS DON'T THEY" 3 POSTS UNDER.*
---
yes
---
Why is that?
---
Nothing will happen. Most of my alt accounts are from there and then have been fine for all those years.
---
&gt;Aetherblade Jumping puzzle and dive
---
Just did it the other day, got really annoyed with the jump pads but got it done eventually. Definitely one of the more interesting ones out there
---
Wonderful, great mindset to have - Best of luck! Mine Iron ore like crazy!
---
Expectation:   Mithril and rags
---
Reality: "Map full"
---
Oh well I totally missed that disco then tho personally mainly roam alone and dont tend to run with zerg, but that said I can see how it was boring xd
---
You continue to attribute to me claims and arguments that are completely invented by you.  
---
You're entitled to your own opinion, but you don't get to tell me mine.
---
is it a nice rock?
---
Bet you didnt played the story yet. She isnt having a heart attack but she is holding a "branded" flower at her heart. Those flowers are from Aurene when she branded Caith so she could speak to us.
---
&gt;Expecting measures to protect consumers over corporations in the current climate is highly unrealistic.
---
No, this is unrealistic because the proposal is worthless. "Aimed at minors" is useless as a target because many games (especially the lootbox-y ones) are aimed at all age groups to maximize profit.
---
Further, who decides who the game is aimed at? The developer? The publisher? Good luck getting an admission of "this is aimed at minors" then. The courts? Sure, let someone else decide who your product is meant for instead of marketing. That'll end well. Or maybe the rating agency? The article even points out why that would be phenomenally stupid. 
---
It's meant as attention grabbing publicity stunt since the statement of "Minors shouldn't be allowed to gamble!" would be uncontroversial otherwise and "Think of the children!" hasn't worn out its welcome yet.
---
The only good way to implement something like this would be a need for age-verification before a purchase, but that isn't what this proposal is about.
---
i dont miss citadel of flame.
---
dungeons have pretty good rewards if you are not a scrub and can run them in a timely manner. people do not run them because they are bad or think that dungeons are dead.  
---
i am still doing them and whenever i open a lfg at any time, most of the time the group is full after 1 min or full after 5 when its a dungeonpath which people hate or its late already.
---
D912pxy allows the game to use directx 12 instead of directx 9, potentially improving the performance on new and capable hardware. No graphics changes.
---
Gw2hook is essentially a reshade so that's your eye candy
---
they're never gonna add "true" flying mounts
---
Yeah, I think this was the best one.
---
What the fuck are you even?
---
I am not advocating a pro-life or a pro-choice position, for fuck's sake.  I said it was a difficult issue with no simple solution.  Personally, I feel that if a father is to be held responsible in any way for a pregnancy (which he should), then he should have a *voice*.  Additionally, the pregancy in question is also a person, and probably deserves to have someone advocate on their behalf.
---
I am intentionally using words like "a voice" and "advocacy" because there is no simple solution.  Not all households are the same, and not all circumstances are the same.  Not everyone is an unwed minor working 4 jobs to pay for college or whatever, and also not everyone is upper middle class with a summer house and a maid.  
---
It is a difficult issue because of nuance and because not everything or everyone is the same.
---
I support advocacy and *all* parties being represented in the decision-making process.
---
Now that I have taken the time to make crystal clear how I feel about the issue, would you **please** stop making shit up about what I am saying?
---
In fact, why don't we remember that we're in a video game subreddit and consider the subject tabled.
---
Thief needs rework, badly. I bet nobody knows how to do it, honestly. Shame, much of it's mechanics are really fun. Don't forget chrononamcers had to rework their build and rotation every month, compared to that thief nerfs are quite stable.
---
must be that thing jutting out of her chest
---
i did every JP at least once alone.
---
Skipping stones is not that complicated.
---
But i appreciate and use the Mesmer portals to the chest.
---
i love you all Mesmers out their helping people doing their daily stuff quicker.
---
no its 1/3 for 2g a Day ;-)
---
why do infusions *need* to cost 10k+ gold?
---
Many people think so. Many people assume that it's commander's job to somehow make game fun for them. Irritating.
---
you give them 5-10g so that you can get your 2g daily reward?
---
That doesn't make any sense :-)
---
Aaaaaah the good memories...
---
I get where you coming from, but not being able to use flying mounts without good reason, when they exist and work everywhere else would be just as bad. 
---
If they find a good excuse/explanation: sure. Otherwise they will have to design the maps in a way that complements the existence of flying mounts.
---
I feel like it doesn't have a strong character as a design. I mean, look at Twilight/Sunrise/Eternity and they have very strong and apparent themes. 
---
I am not sure what the design is. Glass? Ribbons? Colorful twirly bits? Mesmer theme? Its weird.
---
Not finished with the PoF story yet (returning player) but I remember the boss fight in HoT so well, it was epic. The whole atmosphere was like "now you safe the world or we all die" and I loved it!
---
I like announcing that I got a Chak Egg Sac and linking my green wood logs to guild.
---
They can say days, which could mean it's coming out tomorrow but they can say days and still release it at the end of the month.
---
They can say weeks and you'll know it's coming out later rather than sooner.
---
gw2hook is a branch of reshade made specifically for gw2 so it doesn't fuck up your UI
---
Well no thats my point. The post says more information in the coming days. In the past they would say coming weeks.
---
Jp is not Amazing content. Is one of the most frustrating content in Gw2. You don't fight against gravity, you fight against stuttering, dodge missclicks, Low fps, and so on.
---
God bless the mesmers, i don't want to waste 40 minutes eating My liver for a stupid chest.
---
Is this near the wind cantle? I don't remember that structure on the right.
---
Yes that would be more practical.
---
Very nice, waiting for it to be ready
---
Why is this spoiler tagged
---
yes it is before the wind cantle
---
Defintly, the Hot Main Theme, it was the first song that i hear after installing Gw2. And it rly Build up this heroic feeling that this kind of game had. I rly miss it as the Main Menu Theme and i rly hope there will someday bring a option to select, what Music u hear in the Main Menu.
---
Yeah Anet copy Blizzard you know the thing you have been avoiding doing since 2012. Look I get the rationale behind it but unlike WoW where you can fly across a map and not do anything. GW2 doesn't have mounts like this.
---
The HoTs soundtrack
---
The rally to arms for the Pact, where it felt nothing could stop you, that you were truly the heroes....
---
were...the heroes...
---
&gt;Are those things fixed yet or not?
---
No, because they don't need to be. They're not bugs, that's how the game works. You can rebind the keys however you want to, but the first 5 skills are based on your weapons. That's how it's designed.
---
As for the mouse, you hold RMB to turn/look around. If you don't like that you can try the action camera (you need to keybind it) which basically makes the controls work like a third person action game: just move the mouse to look around, RMB to select target, LMB to autoattack (skill #1). Since it's bound to a key you can easily swap between action and normal camera whenever you need to.
---
&gt;...wonky, cheesy...
---
What exactly feels wonky and cheesy? Seems completely subjective to me.
---
&gt;...unstable, slow laggy...
---
Seems like a connection issue rather the problems with the game itself.
---
good vid ty for sharing. Too bad many gw2 players don't see the harm and keep protecting this.
---
\*Unrewarding events are turning boredom into disappointment and even disgust in many cases.\*
---
With the ridiculously small chance of someone relevant reading this statement, I urge AN to tread carefully when comes to the public opinion of their product.
---
Yeah, HoT has tons of great music in it.
---
And Fear Not This Night is an absolute masterpiece, I frequently let it play in the background on YouTube/Spotify while doing other stuff.
---
It may be decomissioned now (Unsure as I've not tested it) but I don't see why it wouldn't work 
---
/u/queicherius actually recreated this launcher and released it a couple years back. [Link](https://github.com/queicherius/gw2-beta-launcher)

Guild Wars 2 Original Soundtrack was exclusively sold by Soules company DirectSong. It was a nightmare. Many people had delivery times of several months, many people still didn't get their copy till today.
---
Oh wow, that's the first time I've heard of this, that's awful :/
---
It's a good theme and back in the day it gave me goosebumps, but I'd rather have the original OG theme back! 
---
And if possible old LA ♥
---
They show a couple extra effects that didn't make it into the previous trailers.  Most notably the footprints, which would be better shown on a different floor IMO.
---
I did 5 world bosses, opened those 5 boxes, and knew it wasn't worth doing anymore at all. Though, it was nice seeing so many players doing world bosses again.
---
This, happend to near all Game Soundtrack where Soul, produced. Skyrim....
---
We dont know how much skyscale will cost to unlock. 
---
Beetle and Warclaw (WvW mount) not expensive at all.
---
It is Caith and she is holding the flowers that are important to her in the last chapter we played so ofc she is keeping them close to her heart.
---
yeah so much memories, it always reminds me of every single character I made during that era, wish we could choose which theme we want in our login!
---
&gt; Expectations are what keep people's drive to do content.
---
Exactly. I tried a round of bosses for the last couple of days.
---
Got nothing that I can't get from farming nodes in WvW. I'm done with this.
---
Oh God please don't let it return as a gemstore item or something bulshitty D:
---
how about some T5 instead?
---
LS3 Have some of the best farming places, like Bitterfrost frontier. I’ve saved hundreds of gold coins just grinding daily to get ascended gear *with* PoF or HoTs stats for my alts
---
Even if this passes the only thing I see them changing is probably having everyone who plays sign or check a box that lets them know if you're a minor or not. If you are then boxes are disabled, if you're not then everything just stays the same. Work-around.
---
Guild Wars 1 EotN login screen music was a true call to a heroic battle.
---
I would often delay logging in just to listen to the Heart of Thorns login theme. It feels maybe a little out of place on a login screen but I don't care, it's just so good!
---
What class do you play?
---
funny you say that, he doesnt really stream or play gw2 often but hes still one of the most viewed gw2 channels lol.
---
Now they know ;)
---
Lol I thought ow meant over watch at first!
---
Lmao
---
I was running a condi trapper druid until recently - it's viable after the nerfs but it's not brilliant. It's definitely usable though. That being said, I don't like GS/Axe/sword/torch, and I love the druid glyphs, so I find it more fun to play a slightly subpar druid than a more suitable Soulbeast. Shortbow is much more fun imho, and I love the Celestial avatar aesthetics.
---
The problem with making the infusions really expensive is the duration of the event.  Having items that require well above average playtime to obtain is bad PR.  If the event were longer this wouldn’t be an issue.  The highest tier currency item should only require 2-3 hours a day gameplay max.  If a person wanted to go for multiple high tier items that is their choice:
---
I didn't expect infusions or any high tier loot for that matter but when i saw what i got i decided an hour in fractals is way more rewarding. I had fun and so did everyone else but the reward you get isnt proportional to the effort you put in, unlike in other pve content. It's just a fun event, that's it.
---
Looking open world builds on YouTube by Nike. He tends to prefer builds that DPS and have some supporting abilities
---
I just posted the acquisition method for PvP mistforged on another reddit.
---
Just so you know.... The Glorious “Hero” Armor is NOT the “glorious armor” from the reward track.
---
Glorious Hero Armor is from old mAT wins from before the newer armors were in game.
---
99% of current players do NOT have the older glorious heroes skins so they must use the Ardent skin unlocks method to reach the mistforged armor unlocks.
---
Just sayin it can be somewhat confusing
---
Was finding a hidden enclave, grinding out a tedious collection, grinding for 250 gold, not "work" for a griffon? Lmao
---
TD isn't half bad once you play some more in there, but pretty much only get to that damned library once before having to scour it for Griffon stuff.
---
WoW is a sewer of meme speaking man-children at this point. Heres really no comparison.
---
Your gear is probably fine, actually. Without knowing what you have, it's hard to tell. There was a significant change to runes and sigils a while ago, but it mostly made them *better*. Support builds changed quite significantly in the last 6 months, but DPS builds are mostly fairly similar. 
---
There was a move towards crafted and unlocked gear over gold-sinks (although ascended is still expensive whatever you do). The beetle and warclaw are unlocked through collections. I don't think either have a cost in gold, rather map- or mode-specific currencies.
---
Given that the option to right-click and select "unlock skin" is right there, I'm not surprised that it either hasn't been worked on or is very low-priority.
---
Oh the drama, the tragedy!
---
Dude looks like a lady
---
It rocks.
---
Issue is, if they increase the material rewards you earned, it would destroy those economies and make them worthless. If they are to increase rewards, they would need to be unique and not tied to gold/materials.
---
Fractals are daily-gated, so the comparison is not fair. Dungeons do have good rewards for the time it takes to complete them, enough that they can compete with most other farms, the problem is that the community doesn't realise this, and thus never looked back after abandoning them.
---
The fact that lfg is empty and the players that do join are not familiar with speed running tactics are a community problem, not a problem with dungeons themselves, but the harm is done anyway.

And as such, I say let them SUFFER

Golden pogo stick!
---
The expansions are frequently 30-50% off from official retailers. Each comes with new maps and new elite specifications (basically sub-classes). 
---
Heart of Thorns has a focus on huge events and has a glider to help navigate. Path of Fire is generally more of a solo experience but has access to several mounts. If you can get a good deal, it's absolutely worth getting both.
---
The game has a very extensive achievement system.  I tend to spend most of my time in Dungeons, Fractals or Raids.  If the mood hits sometimes I'll play player vs. player.  I enjoy pushing the limits of what I can do with my current skill level and fighting bosses.  It helps that instanced PvE tends to be fairly profitable which lets me craft legendaries or buy nice gem-store items every few months. 
---
I'm not huge on achievements, but I do like more difficult achievements that involve well put together collections.  There are quite a few of these if you're only just starting out.  I think the raid titles like, "The Eternal," "Demon's Demise," "Champion of Zommoros," or "Voice in the Void," are a really cool reward and reflection on time spent on some of the harder challenge mote content in the game. 
---
I don't play a whole lot of open world content except when it's new.  It's fun to explore and see what a new patch or map has to offer.  I think ArenaNet generally isn't afraid to change things, but that they don't always hit the mark when it comes to balance patches.  This makes balance patches in of themselves fun content in the sense of a community activity in figuring out the changes.  
---
The game has stories that have improved over time; from Zhaitan to Heart of Thorns &amp; Path of Fire as well as the episodic living world series.  LS2, LS3 and LS4 provide story between expansion cadences.  However, these are 200 gems each and I know that can be a bit of a turn-off for people that have only recently joined the game.  They aren't strictly necessary to enjoy the game, but tend to provide a lot of core, HoT &amp; PoF mastery points for unlocking additional quality of life masteries. 
---
The mastery system itself is a good way to frame your gameplay.  It can seem a little tedious at first, but it takes several months to work through at the minimum and while it can seem grindy at first it really does lend to an exploration of all the things that GW2 has to offer as a PvE, PvP/WvW &amp; open world focused game.  It keeps you busy with varied tasks.  
---
I like PvP in the sense that it's really satisfying and fun to see that your build or build(s) have a direct influence on other players.  Whether they're struggling to kill you, you're supporting your team or vaporizing people with burst or conditions.  It can be really satisfying to pull off an outplay and simultaneously down or kill multiple players at once.  
---
I think in order to enjoy GW2 enjoying the gameplay itself is a core requirement.  You're not always going to be working on gear progression or character progression beyond ascended equipment or elite specializations.  It's important to note that really learning your builds and professions can result in what would otherwise seem abnormal mounts of damage relative to other players.  Experienced players survive longer, deal *significantly* more damage and have a lot of "carry potential," overall. 
---
The game is setup in a way such that for the most part it's very cooperative.  People won't try to keep you down, but breaking into harder areas of the game does require joining certain discords or working on your damage, boons or buffs until they're quantifiably and noticeably decent.  The damage difference between a newbie and an experienced player can vary by like 5 or 6 times.
---
I really miss the beta login screen tbh
---
i use gw2taco markers for all jp's and my daredevil staff#5 skill. some of them i can do easily enough without markers, just had a lot of practise at those ones.
---
when i first came to the game, jp's were an insane nightmare, my brain-to-fingers reaction time wasnt tuned i guess and i hated them, now i enjoy all jp's. but some, like skipping stones, i have never completed without a mount shortcut or a teleport. i now have all cheevs for jumping puzzles except for the wvw ones. i was kinda waiting for the wvw server merge so i can do it with a friendly map and friends.
---
The part before the comma in your second point, as well as the fifth point are the most legitimate issues with this thing currently, because if the article was accurate in that the current bill does not explicitely state how it will differentiate which games kids play or not, then this bill will only amount to a political stunt.  Basically lawyers will lawyer it into oblivion, it's what lawyers do.  
---
The thing point 4 referebces is meant to pressure players in affected countries to get their governments to undo the laws.  It's the company very directly saying, "Oh your nation voted to not pay?  Well look at what you can't have now.  What're you gonna do about it now, huh?"  
---
Whether or not anyone actually at Anet has a direct hand in it, it's a very blatant FU to players in the affected areas and it will blow back hard if nations with larger and/or louder populations start seeing that in the gem store.  
---
The lootbox issue actually spans the globe, and is still expanding with each game that implements it for the first time or is developed to lean on it.  It's a consumer irritation that is constantly being renewed, with an international market who refuses to listen to their customers; The customers who have no other choice for the content provided other than paying an unknown amount (The true sticking point of the issue, though the rush of the gamble is another level of it).  This type of exploitation of the citizens is what Western style governments, in theory/*, are supposed to stop because the markets and companies running them refuse to.  
---
/*Reddit's per-post character limit isn't nearly long enough for this rant
---
Are support classes actually wanted in PvP? Up until now I've been doing well as a bunker/support but I'm suddenly getting a lot of QQ about the lack of damage. I thought that was the deal with bunkers - stay alive on points and keep teammates alive? Am I doing it wrong?
---
Draconis Mons
---
I can be Spider Man
---
If I could have a golden pogo stick instead of Bunny as a reward for jumping puzzles.....I'd be thrilled.
---
yea i had that problem while creating Eternity.
---
Had just finished my Twillight and immidiatly threw it into the forge with my old Sunrise and fell into despair :(
---
Support hooked me up though :)
---
Let me get this straight. You are playing with that many monitors AND on a laptop? On God.
---
Left clicking on nothing interactible will untarget, that's probably your issue.
---
Targets do not disappear unless you make them, they die or they stealth.
---
You can target closest enemy with an input (not sure what the default key is, might be 'C').
---
You do not seem like you are trying to get into the game but want to game to shape itself for you :
---
* That's not gonna work.
---
* It doesn't give much incentive to try and help you...
---
Simply breathtaking
---
Nice trailer, but sadly no information at all.
---
Not for fractals or raids. You want to stack and share boons/receive healing. And almost every time melee will perform better than range in terms of dps.
---
For open world events, casual dungeons, casual low level fractals I found Deadeye to be quite strong in terms of dps thanks to Maleficent Seven.
---
yes but if you go on the video page you see it was uploaded 2 days ago. why was it only found now?
---
Omfg why can't I find this on yt? Is this legit? For real?
---
probably because it might be spoilery and they want us to do the story first and enter the map (and discover its name) a bit more naturally.
---
to leave the name out says a lot imho.
---
Expansions are way more taxing on hardware than core tyria. Especially HoT, have some heavy maps, where you may drop down in fps. It all depends on how much you can take and still feel reasonably fine.
---
It may vary depending on you specs, at newer maps you can get arround 30 fps or drop to even 10-15. There are a lot of factors that contribute to that.
---
Yeah pretty sure he has done that multiple times over the years, guess twitch staff was there for it this time or someone reported him.
---
I love that login theme though it was a little jarring going from 0 to 11 in terms of volume when launching the game :P
---
its from the official GW2 facebook account
---
they said that they will give us more infos in the upcoming days.
---
Yeah just saw that, but why is it not posted on yt or Twitter, this social media are way more active
---
just play wow then 4Head
---
&gt;EXPLAIN THAT SHIT. YOU CAN'T COS THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"just rebind the" NO. SHUTTAFUCKUP.
---
Then don't play it. It's not like we need assholes like you in the game, anyway. What a fucking child..
---
Yes u can
---
I'm thinking my theory was right well the date proves it I think we may get a teaser of the armour today, the new map possibly tomorrow or the trailer next Monday or the trailer today. I know its narcissistic but the amount of hate I got for speculating May 14th seems worth it now.
---
what I think is, that ppl sterted to watch it and thought it would be some kind of requiem related trailer and stopped watching it and just missed the big reveal at the end. :D
---
I think he said he thought they did the right thing, but for him personally the incentive to "tryhard" was gone when the cash tournaments went away.
---
You had to do this in XIV and it was an unnecessary time sink. I hated it. And it wasn't fun when they relocated a bunch of wind currents so you could help everyone who just wanted to power through it, do so.
---
Nobody likes this shit. You already have to do a quest/collection for griffon, roller beetle, and skyscale. That's rewarding. That's a journey, that's fun. Unlocking flying in XIV is not.
---
It could have been a mistake. The post doesn't mention the new episode and just seems to be a generic advertisement. If Anet had been preparing for multiple release dates and this was accidentally posted on Facebook it would explain the lack of media elsewhere, formal announcement and really short time to release compared with previous trailers.
---
Holy shit! This has to be one of there best trailers yet! This is how you pull people in.
---
The Facebook post doesn't mention the new episode and just seems to be a generic advertisement. If Anet had been preparing for multiple release dates and this was accidentally posted on Facebook it would explain the lack of media elsewhere, formal announcement and really short time to release compared with previous trailers.
---
I'd still be very happy with it actually being the 14th of course!
---
Sounds logic
---
it says the 7th of may at my end (maybe timezone tomfuckery)
---
Maybe it's an unreleased one with an old release date, since everything else points to the 21st.
---
That's interesting. I got T6 trophies for pretty much all the bosses on the first day......I wonder if I used up my RNG luck for the entire year for that, lol.
---
Until we log in and check the dailes tab
---
I agree with you, though you could maybe say it was "noisy" because he did make a video/stream about it. If I search for "helseth twitch" the second result is the twitch vod "Moving on from Guild Wars 2".
---
It's designed this way because when you have 2 weapons (main and off hand), the first 3 skills are the main hand skills and the last 2 are from the offhand. This design also allows easier communication between players (everyone know what you're talking about when you say "dagger 2 on thief"), and has some kind of coherence between all classes: 1st is an auto attack, 2nd is most of the time a good damage dealer, 5th is like the "elite" weapon skill (usually have a special effect and/or a longer cooldown).
---
This also allows devs to play with this design, mostly for the 3rd skill. Thiefs can have the 3rd skill change depending on their main hand and offhand (pistol without offhand is different from double pistol), and the weaver spec for the elementalist plays a lot with the 3rd skill being a "dual element" skill.
---
&gt; unlike in wow where I can literally multitask 20+ skills with sequence macros without even moving my hand.
---
That looks lazy, the combat design is meant to be active in GW2. If you want a game like WoW, go play WoW I guess.
---
that's what I call a HYPE  
---
I want this song on repeat please btw
---
Don't forget the HoT combat music! I prefer that to the PoF ones too.
---
Its not new for this kind of thing to happen. Back during HoT IGN revealed raids before Anet did their press conference at PAX Prime, Anet back during HoT revealed the release date for the expansion before PAX Prime. I'm pretty sure a couple of living world trailers have released before Anet wanted.
---
Might also explain the no map or armor names.  Especially when we got an armor name already
---
What.
---
 Your division doesn't matter. 
---
&gt;**Calculations:** If our win rate is 50%, our loss rate is 50%, our top stats rate is 50%, and our close game rate is 5%, then a single PvP game is worth this many pips:  
---
&gt;10(0.5) + 3(0.5) + 1(0.5) + 1(.05) = 5 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.05 = **7.05 pips earned per game, on average.**
---
70% winrate gives
---
10(0.7) + 3(0.5) + 1(0.5) + 1(.05) = 7 + 1.5 + 0.5 + 0.05 = 9.05 pips earned per game, on average.
---
6030 / 9.05 = **666 Rounding down.**
---
6330 / 9.05 = 700 games after rounding up.
---
So 15 minutes x 666 games = 166,5 hours of PvP.
---
Or 15 minutes x 700 games = 175 hours of PvP.
---
Did a mod just hide this post? It no longer appears on the subreddit when sorted by new
---
Holy damn the MUSIC! &lt;3 &lt;3
---
That hasn't worked out well for people in the past...
---
ERP
---
"-*Upgradable* Armor-"
---
Looks like there might be more than one set with this release?
---
I can say I have never opened the achievement panel for a new episode before I've entered the new map before. Might just be because I'm excited about the story, though.
---
Except a release date...?
---
ha, first thing I do is pressing M and looking for the "80" :D
---
Anyone else think they tried to go too phylisophical and fail, some of that didn't make sense.
---
Thanks. But I am able to read a title.
---
&gt; This is the problem with getting the government involved in games.
---
Government involvement more or less needs to be a nuclear option to encourage industry to effectively self-regulate.  Only when industry repeatedly fails to provide adequate curbs to abusive behavior does government get involved.
---
&gt; Ideally they'd just look at the content of the game and make a determination for the intended audience. 
---
Nothing of the sort.  They'll work from the ESRB rating and complaints.  If a game has gambleboxes and carries anything less than an M or AO rating they'll get hit with huge fines.  Most developers still see the M rating as the kiss of death.
---
visible for me under "new"
---
Wow fuck this. I literally just changed my boxers and I already need a new pair.
---
Hype is real.
---
No, both ascended pvp armor are precursors, **Mistforged Glorious Hero's armor** is just shinier.
---
Expectations subverted
---
Tangled depths
---
And close second is verdant brink
---
Yeah never do this, there are always bugs. If anything, it is always great to go to work, let the common folk be on the receiving end of the bad bugs and when you get home it hopefully works!
---
Which is a stupid thing to expect...
---
That would break the economy of those items. A better analysis would be to think that you'll get the same loot rate than usual, aka infinitesimal.
---
I hope LWS5 has a new theme and background art
---
They actually did it! The absolute madmen! I'll admit I got a bit suspicious when the legendary teaser didn't specify a date despite the month being a third over, but I never dared to hope that they would actually release it before the 21st.
---
Yeah! HoT theme = hype!
---
Wow that trailer was really well done 🤯🤯
---
This is what makes this community so great. Seeing how much work has been put into the game and wanted to go out of your way to get others to appreciate it as well.
---
It does say season 4 finale War eternal may 14th.. How does that not mention the new episode?
---
None of us have hidden it!
---
No, both ascended armor you get through spvp vendor or from tournament will work.
---
Only one of those require being lvl 100
---
Launchbuddy also has a feature to pull off something similar
---
Fuck me, 5 days to finish prep work on that sword, I thought I had a bit more time lol.
---
Last line sounded very weird to me. What is the meaning of it even?
---
There's a save button
---
In my timezone the patch will hit tuesday evening and then i take wednesday off and enjoy the bugfixes after some healthy sleep :D
---
Interesting, if I log into my acc it is invisible, if I log out then it appears in the /new list - and no, I haven't hidden it or swiped it away.
---
I've had that happen before and I have no idea why. I just chalked it up to weird internet goblins :)
---
As much as I love the way HoT music sounds, [the music during the Balthazar fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkUMvj3s4RM) is pretty sick too.
---
Gotta say nice trailer, looking forward to next episode.
---
&gt;Its likely on all their social media and set to a timer for release
---
This, I guess. My job involves posting on social media for my company, and we plan a lot of things in advance.
---
Btw, Maclaine Diemer [commented on the cover](https://twitter.com/maclainediemer/status/1126279814845874179) too! I just wanted to share it with you all because I can't possibly contain all the happiness on my own XD
---
Would it be rewarding if every second drop as a "very rare" drop and everybody had them after the event?
---
Do you bro
---
Exotic Aquabreathers are only available as rare drops in Wintersday gifts, or as a reward choice for completing Wintersday achievements. As such, they're infeasible to get right now.
---
You can also jump straight to Ascended breathers, which can be crafted like normal helmets using recipes available on the TP, or can be purchased from [an NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dive_Master_Astora)
---
Hell, I didn't even KNOW there was a jumping puzzle after Morgan until this time through. Actually looked around and went "what's this over....why are all these sylvari trying to -" \*sees mushroom pattern against wall\* "Oh. NO. Another  one???"
---
That said, I do wish the chests took into account actual level of person completing the puzzle, and gave loot that reflected the level.
---
Pre-redesign, CSS is used to change AutoModerator's name to appear as Tybalt Leftpaw.
---
Finale is made by kourna team, we know how well polished patch was for that release. Don't waste your day off on crashes :)
---
That damn Mordrem Bloom vendor is still pinned to the edge of the compass in Lornar's Pass
---
Thanks to your post, I bought the 3 of em. I wanted to do so for a while and kinda forgot about it cuz life happens. You just reminded me :3. Cant wait to start reading!
---
It also suggests the purpose of Aurene *ehem* having a snack of a certain death variety this season
---
Nah they already returned Kamadan and that was pretty cool
---
Apparently, you aren't or you can't since you said, and I quote: "sadly no information at all".
---
you can see them when you do the missions though ;)
---
I suspect it'll be something like the astral and stellar weapons in Istan. 
---
Type one: sexy shield. 
---
Type two: sexy sparkleshield.
---
Not all of them
---
It could be rewarding with some target achievement with some reward aside of ghostly chance of getting infusion. Do you really like to kill bosses over and over and over again without getting anything? It's mmorpg, getting loot is a base and main trait of genre.
---
You are not right. You base all this on your experiences on diferent games. Gw2 isnt like diferent games and you should know that after 6 years. You are not dissapointed in this game but on your own expectations. Noone was saying that you will get legendary items while doing these events ! Noone was forcing you to do them. It is something what we could do between episodes. If you dont want to be doing this then go and farm , do raids or Fotm, play with your friends it doesnt mater. You are only mad on yourself right now. "You can downvote all you want, but you know I'm right."
---
&gt; we are here for the drops and Arenanet give us a middle finger instead of items.
---
What do you mean? You are recieving the Bonus Box of Goods as promised. It's all working as intended.
---
Fool, now I take your place as the 102324458th in line for Chak Egg Sac.
---
After all the time we had it, honestly, no. I was so sick and tired of it and fell in love with the PoF login screen during the playtest weekend. It's not bad, but for the amount of time we had to listen to it, I can't really miss it.
---
does anyone know the timer for Mark III Suppressor Golem ? Because it's been 40 mins now and the golem hasn't showed up yet.
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
why would a lot of upvotes here mean you can post it on the official forums? if you want to post this on the official forums, nothing is stopping you.
---
The main issue is that people were stupid enough to get into the event thinking that the infusions would drop like mad. That was never the case, nor is the event in any way or form forcing (or even pushes you) to join in. 
---
It is just a bit of extra rewards with a chance for some nice stuffs for people.
---
Yep, GW2 is surely not like all different games. Even worst gacha shit respect your time more than GW2.
---
Nah, you get an upvote from me.  I've stopped after 2 days. WvW event was good for me as I could get visible progress towards rewards I was wanting...it was true engagement.  This is just like highlighting loot tables and saying you could get this....but I could also blow up a normal mob and get a precursor.  I get that those items in the box are more rare, but still...its just a bummer to wait around for 10 15 mins to get a rare and a few low mats.
---
Mesmer finally gets a legendary that adds effects with its attacks and people start complaining? Of course its going to have effects for other classes.
---
It would destroy the economy if this wasn't a temporary event but a permanent change in boss loot. We see a huge influx of valuable stuff from Haloween and Wintersday with no damage to economy whatsoever.
---
You can leech rewards in most gamemodes. I heard people like loot.
---
You know that these boxes are -&gt; *additional* &lt;- rewards, yes?
---
You also get your normal loot from every world boss, which is good compared to the effort it needs. 
---
Also, what do you expect? A box have a *super rare* chance to give you one of the *most expensive* items in the game. Did you really expect that you get one of those from every 5th box?  With only a bit logical thinking, you wouldn't. 
---
And what you seems to forget -&gt; every box gives a guaranteed rate unidentified gear *additional* to any other drop. So even if your drop only trash, you have one additional rare/exotic item per world boss. 
---
This event isn't unrewarding at all, but you only see the super rare items and tell to yourself that it would be an easy way to get much gold. Anet doesn't give us a middlefinger instead of items, *you* give *yourself* a middlefinger by lying to yourself.
---
I actually got so used to doing them as charr with swiftness that I would hate it if I got transformed for the JP. =p
---
So far any criticism of this event is met with extreme arguments the other way like yours which is ridiculous. The event is unrewarding. 99% of the time you'll get absolute junk and they couldn't even put an achievement for doing a certain number of bosses or making the full circuit.
---
If you think parenting is that easy, life is waiting to do things to you that only happen in hentai, but you absolutely will not enjoy it. Oo
---
You must not have had family who would do things like take the family car for a joy ride to the 7eleven at midnight to buy a slurpee with the parents credit cart at age 13, or intentionally wait for their mom to be alseep so they could ask for cash, or for a friend to come over or anything else they would otherwise need permission for (sometimes not even bother actually asking) so that mom wouldn't have a solid memory to confirm or deny.  
---
Good luck parenting that level of bullshit without having Child Protective Services crawling up your ass with a microscope because that little shit absolutely will start pulling that card ASAP.  And they'll make certain that they only get taken to shrinks who won't call them out for their other abusive behaviors, etc.  
---
Ahh kids, so sweet and innocent...  Yeah.
---
(  Join a legion 11 Million Strong. Get in the game and play with no subscription fees ever! Promotional offer ends May 19th. )    
---
what does this means???!!
---
On the plus side, the only thing you lost out on is a couple gold and a kinda weird-looking skin. If the skin is actually something you want, you could try and put in a support ticket saying you picked the wrong thing and seeing if they'll exchange it (they're usually pretty good about that sort of thing). It might be too late if you've already stat-swapped, but you could still try anyway.
---
They should make it so it unlocks in achievment when you destroy it in any way i.e forge, discard, salvage use for crafting. It works for unlocking skins so it should for achievments.
---
This is starting to get edgy, like a 10 year old is writing it thinking that it sounds so cool and mysterious..
---
no, you are not. 
---
and literally every festival in WoW comes to my mind when I played it after legion release.
---
most boring and unrewarding shit I have ever seen.
---
Good job!
---
Keep in mind that it spawns in 3 different locations. I'm not sure, but they may well all share a timer, so if it's up elsewhere it might not be able to spawn where you're watching. If you're watching every spawn... I don't have any idea, sorry
---
To be fair, this event wasn't intended to be the most efficient farm for a week. 
---
However, people can like it or not, but they shouldn't complain about "getting nothing" (that's what OP did), because 1.) that's not true and 2.) you don't have to do it. If you want an efficient farm, you should join an efficient farm.
---
All what she said sounds to me like that saying that creation comes from destruction. I wanna guess something better will show up in its place, like an ascended aurene.
---
I know there is a reason for this taking so long but thanks god finally something new. Lw is not made to take huge amounts of time between the updates.
---
The economy of Guild Wars 2 has always been screwed up and mirrored that of our world. Arenanet just went on with it, considering the fact they are profiting in the long run - 500 gems are like 180 gold now, when they used to be 100 gold several years ago.
---
One of the guys of this guild I used to be in broke out of maps all the time and say something like 'lol I broke out of X lol' every time. Saying gz after every time was my only interaction with him. God bless him.
---
I used to love JPs when the game first came out.  Then people figured out how to abuse the jump system to climb up walls in WvW.
---
Now I hate JPs because I remember how good the jumping used to be in this game.  Now you have to make sure there isn't a slightly higher ledge somewhere near you otherwise you can't jump and will just fall to your doom.  It also made jumping feel way less responsive.
---
I wish I could somehow get the old jump system back even if just at jumping puzzles.
---
Ill Omens Skirmish Event in LotrO.
---
I guess we'll see.  The first trailer just said "New Armor Set", so this is the first indication there might be more than one.
---
&gt;Maybe you mistake mmos for multiplayer games
---
No, I know the difference. There was no mistake. I know exactly what I said.   
---
&gt; Well, how many boxes did you opened already? If you like to kill bosses, I'm sure it's around at least 70 boxes, I'm right? 
---
I don't have a number on how many I've opened. It's certainly not that many. Besides, I wasn't doing this event for the boxes and wasn't expecting a lot anyway.   
---
I'm sorry if your experience wasn't to your 'expectations' but seriously, calm your little tantrum down.
---
People can do whatever they want. Just like I can create posts with feedback about event. I'm not forcing you to read it.
---
Idk, mine runcrafter breakeven in less than 24 hours.... you just need to salvage a lot
---
I'm having major deja vu. I feel like this exact thing happened with I wanna say episode 2
---
10% wvw only because pvp died entirely, raids lost excitement and pve isnt really growing either. 
---
Wvw on reddit used to be more controversial than pvp, and it definitely didn't grow. But most of the time theres not much to talk about either way.
---
oh yeah, I've got no intentions as of now to buy expansion. I'll play with my friend(how's a veteran, but kinda dropped it due to being alone) and my nephew.
---
50% of the events in Rift, the endgame events in Flyff, pretty much all events in Tales of Pirates, let's not get started about EVE..
---
It's possible that the interpretation is meant to be taken metaphorically and that it's speaking about the virtue of self-sacrifice and the way a person can live on beyond death if their death inspires or revitalises others. The war eternal in the context of this passage could be interpreted to mean eternal life since this piece asserts that war equals life. So even if you die, you live on through the inspiration you've left behind, similar to the norn concept of legends and legacy. This suggests that Aurene's death may instigate or inspire some as yet unseen consequence; galvanising people to take up arms against Kralkatorrik or something out of left field pertaining to Glint's earlier conversation with Aurene regard Ascension.
---
However, it could also be taken literally. Balthazar did collect souls in the afterlife that he formed into an army. In Guild Wars 1 the player can travel to Balthazar's domain, the Fissure of Woe, where you can fight alongside soldiers in Balthazar's spirit army who are called Eternals. So the meaning of this passage might be a literal instruction to avoid cowardice and seek out an inspiring conflict because even if you die, you will be brought back as an Eternal in Balthazar's army. In Guild Wars 2, it's my understanding that the Eternals were converted into Forged (RIP in peace Devona), in addition to the Zaishen and whatever poor bastards Balthazar and the Forged could get their hands on. It's unknown if Balthazar's entire force was converted into Forged or if there's still a remnant in the Mists that could be recruited to fight Kralkatorrik.
---
So maybe this is meant to be taken literally, metaphorically or both? We'll find out in like a week or so, I guess.
---
I still think you talking not about mmos, because all of them are about loot.
---
You can see amount in the achievement. It's weird, you like to kill bosses, so why your number is low?
---
Actually this event *does* reward players. With additional items to the normal reward plus a super rare chance of super expensive items. 
---
But OP is one of the greedy ones, he only want expensive stuff and because we doesn't get those, he complains about this "shitty event".
---
Depends on the Skyscale.
---
I like [this tree in queensdale](https://i.imgur.com/GsAZBGy.jpg)
---
True that, we evil. Please ban us all.
---
Yes, i'm sure you made your post just for yourself, never expecting any sort of negative feedback. It's like writing in a diary.
---
&gt;They could've at least make achievement with some reward for killing some amount of bosses during event
---
You mean something like getting an additional box of loot for every boss kill? It's exactly what you want and it's exactly what we got with this event.
---
Oh definitely. I'd have been okay with the astral disk if it didn't sit so far away from my character's arm. I went for the stellar one mostly so it didn't look so floaty.
---
If you're "here for the drops," then you're playing the wrong game.
---
There's a weaponsmith selling white weapons in the lobby, but since quality doesn't matter in pvp that's all you need.
---
Yes - Dont make a ranger. Pick something usefull. I know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion, but i dont care
---
So how exactly pets, cloaks and housing items and GUARANTEED epic item is worse than this mess?

Ranger, Warrior, and Necro are good classes for newbies.  Sylvari are a good choice for your first playthrough, if you aren't drawn to a particular race already.
---
Here is a [good video](https://youtu.be/Mf56mu6O4fM) with general tips for beginners.
---
With the consequences of removing/restricting for everyone involved, not just minors. I can read. You cannot, however, foresee the consequences.
---
I'm not forcing anyone. You came here on your own.
---
Every single Red Alert event in STO.
---
Just pointing out casual on this sub has no relation to the actual meaning of casual (limited time and effort).
---
But at least I understand he enjoys wvw so simply plays it. I can respect that.
---
You semi afk for 10+ hours a week, presumably semi afk because you dont enjoy the gameplay (?), for what is objectively terrible rewards. Personally I find this absurd, but clearly the game is for maximum leeching of rewards and gameplay is just an afterthought... so what do I know.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/watch-the-trailer-for-war-eternal/
---
Confirmed!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8G-KryZUQA it's official! The Facebook post wasn't a fluke or a mistake, it's 100% true. Ep6 is coming out May 14th, next Tuesday
---
whose is the narrating voice?
---
Last season finale butchered Lazarus's potential story arc. Let's see if this time they learned how to make good finale.
---
I'm getting Endgame trailer vibes from this trailer. Looks very promising imo
---
Oh you mean those...I already panicked and thought I missed something cool.
---
The dead chrono. Did the teleport of sword 4 move him into the shockwave that he blocked?
---
They just uploaded it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8G-KryZUQA
---
It's up on YouTube now!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8G-KryZUQA
---
war... war never changes.... or does it change... NO ITS WAR AND WAR NEVER CHANGES YES? YEEES? NO.
---
A good boy boy
---
They showcased "elite" versions of all weights in the short teaser and the normal version of light in the Exordium preview.
---
Release next Tuesday on the 14th, sooner than most thought!
---
Probably Zafirah
---
You can't really compare epic to rare and pet to 1 scrap of jute.
---
There is no reward for this event. You could spend entire week and get nothing. This is worse than spending week and getting actual and probably unique items.
---
&gt; Ranger is completely useless in WVW.
---
Useless *in blobs*. Fine as a roamer.
---
&gt;For raids/fractals you need expansions cuz core ranger is useless.
---
Well, for raids you need expansions because if you don't have the right expansion for that raid, *you can't get in*. For fractals, core ranger is perfectly fine for t1/2's. 
---
Ranger is a perfectly fine choice as a first character for leveling.
---
Just took time for it to be uploaded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8G-KryZUQA
---
no one know that i would only drop 1 from each.
---
And the most of "us" dont data mine.
---
The worst thing is that the boss only drop the bonus chest the 2nd time you kill him.
---
"No daily limit on world boss loot"
---
Yes they said "Future iterations we’re thinking about are:" but why not in the first one.
---
THAT would be a reward and not that silly bonus chest.
---
Not a mistake! It's official on Youtube now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8G-KryZUQA
---
Release 14th , can't w8.
---
I'm doing daily tasks for 10ap, not 2g.
---
Think it other way: these 5-10g is a fee for being lazy. I have some gold, so even paying 50g for someone in DR to play me music isn't too much xD
---
It's on YouTube now too.
---
funny how this get less upvotes than "low effort posts", good job!!
---
There's nothing old either.
---
I geuss it's a unpopular opinion then. I agree with alot of the comments. Gw's maps are just so beautiful and i personally feel it's much more immersive from the ground.
---
Just an update, it has now been posted to YouTube and Twitter. May 14th confirmed.
---
Okay, music was... dunno how to describe it. It gave me goosebumps.
---
I just want some sexy sparklepants.
---
You can usually block the shockwave with sword 4. I think i might have been hit by something just before the shockwave hit me, though i cant figure out what it was.
---
Oh two days before my birthday :D.
---
Thanks, but just remember people's first word completion after X years is important
---
I'd love to see some of your writing as an adult.
---
I honestly hope Aurene stays dead. Resurrection would ruin self sacrifice part of whole ordeal.
---
Then leave to another mmo?
---
It's on their Youtube channel now as well with the same date, so it's pretty much confirmed genuine.
---
yep. just saw it.
---
Indeed, it is not comparable, because they are completely different games with completely different systems, so comparing them is silly.
---
There is rewards for this event. It might not be the rewards you WANT, but they are still there. If you do 10 or so bosses per day for a week, that alone is 70 unidentified rare gear, which sells for around 18 silver.
---
That is around 12,6 gold, assuming you sell them directly, rather than opening them which would probably generate more.
---
They on top of that it is the materials which also tend to pile upp and sell for quite a bit.
---
So even without getting any of the super rare stuffs, you will be getting plenty of rewards and get quite a bit of gold. And that is ONLY counting the additional rewards, not the rewards you already get from the bosses.
---
I really do miss it, although I am rather sick of the jungle at this point lol
---
5 days :)
---
Yes and no. Joko at least had some time to shine. Lazarus felt much worse, being resurrected and killed within 5 minutes while we threw rocks at illuminati hologram.
---
It's gonna be called Endgame so people stop complaining GW2 has no endgame, but they can't post it because Facebook bans Endgame spoilers 😂😂😂
---
The expansions are on sale now 50% til May 19
---
well there is currently 50% off digital expansions on thier site.
---
Stop... Stop!  I can only get so erect!
---
This video is 1:15 seconds of actual video. Takes almost 0:20 seconds to start then there's like 0:45 seconds left over. So don't be so generous lol
---
I feel like there's been a very intentional point to not show anything about the new map or story, not even the map name as that may very well be a big spoiler. I'm really looking forward to the episode.
---
"Get Smart" - you failed
---
'Get Hurt" - you succeeded
---
So will War Eternal refer to a Balthazar arc that will resurrect Aurene or just the eternal fight in the mists? Probably both.
---
That was my comment the trailer part that is.
---
Music is great, atmosphere is great but the animation is weird. Logan's face looks unpolished and the way Zaphira moves brings a question if she's a human or a reptillian.
---
I think he only wrote the book because he heard scholars are the most powerful and ferocious creature.
---
To be fair, making then so common would screw some things up.
---
Living world but actually not.
---
I see that Path of Fire is 1/2 off. Is the Ultimate edition (with the 4000) gems unavailable during this sale?
---
both expansions are in bundle sale for 25$ 50% on guildwars website now and until may 19th
---
Sure it does.
---
Do you want to go there? Okay...go there...it's not locked away.
---
You don't need an event, collection, achievement, reward, or any of that to go to a place you want to go to.
---
Just buy my wood planks and we're both happy :)
---
Been there ... twice :-(
---
In a world with the Mists it makes more sense.
---
The body is willing but the wallet is limp.
---
No, saying that someone enjoying this event is exactly defending arenanet because this event is awful. 
---
I'm just reading chat for last 80 wb kills. Only new players enjoying event, because it's something new for them.
---
I can cry to mommy if you lend your mom numbers to me. She can even get me shiny. Too bad she never taught you to read, so you would know that I wanted target achievement with unique reward, not easy infusion.
---
it refers to anet pulling doctor strange trick to trap ~~dormammu~~ kralkatorrik
---
They don't put the Ultimate edition on sale, because it's already a pretty significant discount with the gems. (Also it gets all kinds of messy when it comes to refunds / chargebacks with the gems included which is a big issue)
---
Fissure of Woe? Quotes from the Book of Balthazar that name drops the episode. They aren't naming the map because of spoilers meaning it is either somewhere we know with significance or it's name spells out what is going on (inb4 the map is called "the commander stabs kralk through the head with a greatsword made of Aurene), kralk is in the mists, Balthazar's army in the mists was called the eternals, the latest current events takes us the mists. It is looking like those theories of it being in the mists or in fissure of woe are more likely.
---
Had to make sure I covered all the likely bases people might be into, right? After all, Rytlock's fur is just *so soft*.
---
They need a new person in charge of loot. We need more than the same old crappy crafting contents. Yes I've put in more than 9k hours so there's nothing I should be complaining about but I think this game needs more loot and more items to go after to make exploring more fun.
---
It’s spoiler free unless you don’t know # aurene dies
---
How would it have even been a mistake? It’s a new trailer with the date and new voice over.
---
The more I look at it the more androgynous it appears. The hands are pretty masculine, for example.
---
Play HoT first. It will give you a better 
---
If you're really desperate for a mount, then play a bit of WvW for the Warclaw.
---
Does the commander go super saijin next episode?
---
Do you fuck your clothes too after you wash them with softener?
---
Man, someone donate me these large amounts of time like these people seem to have.
---
Yeah, I can definitely see getting used to it. I kindof feel like they're designed without Swiftness in mind, though, and are easier to do without it.
---
Nice. Last Friday I applied for a vacation for next 2 weeks so this is a pleasant surprise.
---
Yeah, I can't do jump puzzles on my Charr, it just doesn't happen without the tonic.
---
Oh, so you are able to know how all those other players feel about the event?  Lol, a little ridiculous to think you can know that.
---
Oh wait, you don’t want them to change the drop rate on infusions?  Didn’t you start this all out taking about the top rate??  Instead you want the entire loot table changed to something you prefer?  Why doesn’t ArenaNet just poll you on every loot table for all events so you don’t have to cry anymore??
---
Okay so I just bought path of fire yesterday, can I get a refund or something?
---
If these events were the best gold/hour, the majority of the player base would be doing them, and then people would see people doing it, and join in, thus people who are trying to do other farms would suffer and have less people, and it'd create a domino effect of more and more people leaving other farms to do this farm due to it being limited AND the most rewarding.
---
That's, however, assuming this event was more than 1.2g/hour, and it's not. I'm glad it's not, but it's very obvious what would happen if this was the BEST farm for 1 week.
---
big tip ingame too 
---
/wiki &lt;content&gt;  
---
in chat brings up the wiki to search the content you typed in
---
if you do this with a linked item (shift click while chat is active on item in equipment/inventory) like 
---
/wiki [Astralaria] 
---
it will go directly to the relevant page.
---
There was probably more to their story than what they were willing to share.  If support knew you would be willing to make things right and get a serial from an official source they would unban the account no doubt.
---
As a warrior, he does need no intelligence. only strength.
---
Taimi really needs a "normal" Asura model. She looks super creepy by now :(
---
There is no upgrade to ultimate, and I don't think you can apply an Ulatimate key to an account that already Standard/Deluxe. Sorry!
---
Anet just replied to someone on twitter and said it's coming in 5 days, so may 14th is confirmed.
---
"if one dies in a way that ensures life is better (or *possible*) for others, one has not truly died"
---
It's a pretty basic idea of altruism and heroic sacrifice, totally solid scripture for a god of war.
---
I guess not seeing as new people like me are still just playing it for the first time.
---
The one you don't use.
---
Even with Soulbeast, Weaver, and Deadeye, the ones with the highest ranged DPS, it's still better to go melee and stack since you'll get more buffs from allies.
---
Dunno. It was all done with a handful of models in the same place as the final scene of the last LS episode. And the graphics weren't even spruced up a lot. The only truly unique thing standing out is sharpening a dagger.
---
Invisible Pants and the upgraded version Sparkle Pants. It's your character's legs, but sparkly.
---
To do this you'll probably have to go through a collection finding remnants of a lost sylvari tribe and uncover their forgotten demise or something suitably grim.
---
Calm down edge fanatic, let's leave writing to people who're good at it, which isn't the case at Anet but oh well, let's roll with it anyway :p
---
Ranger is a fine choice for a new player. It will give you several options to fit a number of different play styles and help you learn the class. It can be useful in Parties or solo (granted this is just PvE, I can't speak for PvP or WvW). Also if you end up leveling the character to 80 and like the game and buy the expansions they both offer really useful Elite Specs to that class.
---
War Without End, Amen.
---
I did it for like 2 hours and got absolutely pathetic crap. I wasn't expecting infusions as they were supposed to have low drop rates, but all the other stuff I got was pathetic, I would have better spent my time in the normal metas with chances of infusion drops as the standard loot from them is so much better.
---
I really want to get the episode but I felt nothing while watching this trailer...
---
It felt so... False... Dunno!
---
Well... I'm sure I'll like the episode anyway!
---
TFW when a trailer for a game update gives you more chills than the deaths of GoT characters in the current season.
---
Very well done, especially the music!
---
Skins are automatically unlocked in the wardrobe when the item is destroyed or consumed in the mystic forge.
---
But they will not always be unlocked for collections. 
---
Using item for crafting may not unlock the skins either.
---
It's always better to right click items to check if you can unlock skins or add to collections.
---
I've kind of accepted by now that the models will always be shitty. I'm more impressed by how they did so much with so little.
---
Music is fantastic, but I think proper credit should also go to the awesome voice acting.   
---
When she pauses briefly and gets to the "War Eternal" line, that's when I was really impressed...!
---
&gt;You also get your normal loot from every world boss, which is good compared to the effort it needs.
---
It's not about effort, it's about time.
---
I've kind of accepted by now that the models will always be shitty. I'm more impressed by how they did so much with so little. The music and cinematrography was the impressive parts, not the animation.
---
The way I heard it, it made no sense, sounds better written down
---
Keep moving, face character towards enemy. Press more than 1 button and learn what your skills do. 
---
Research:
---
Boons
---
Conditions
---
CC/Defiance bar (at level 27ish is a good time before your first dungeon probably)
---
Yeah. If they want to avoid spoilers, they should instead put a large ❓ icon in the slot, instead, and disable preview, but the wardrobe should have 1 slot for each item that can be obtained, so people always know there's more out there.
---
Anyone noticed how they are restraining from showing any shots from new map?
---
Or maybe there will be more than one? Let's say one in mists and one in open world?
---
So far we know exactly nothing about where are we going and it seems it's a super secret.
---
Channeling their inner Ramin Djawadi with the music.
---
Is it that hard to read my original post? I want to feel rewarded, I'm not talking about infusions. They could've make some reward for killing 100 wb. Account bond reward, it's not about gold.
---
i just want my old spear melee autoattack back qq
---
Chicago Cubs aren’t a media organization. The the news report was very neutral actually. And one of incidents don’t equate to it happening all the time. My problem with that statement is that it somehow becomes a defense for situations where the person is actually bigotted. Blanket statements like that honestly scare me. I prefer going through things case by case you know?
---
And for the hand gesture itself, like, I’m iffy on it. It could be an OK gesture, but I don’t know, in today’s climate it’s not the best thing to do in front of a black dude right? It could have been something for the punching game, which is good, because it appears as there is an investigation happening. Hopefully we find out more info soon.
---
Yeah. If they want to avoid spoilers, they should instead put a large ❓ icon in the slot and disable preview until enough people have obtained the item.  
---
But the wardrobe should have 1 slot for each item that can be obtained, so people always know there's more out there.
---
I thought the animation was pretty good, aside from zaphira's movement maybe. The breath the commander takes after standing up is a good example. It's a small movement, but they capture it just right so that it conveys his emotion. His movement is saying something like 'take heart', convincing himself he has to be strong. If that isn't good animation, I don't know what is.
---
First year I played on 15fps max, 7-10 on any newer 5 group content on lowest settings with subsample resolutuon. You should be fine tbh.
---
Lol dragged her body to the base and didnt even take out the crystals....
---
Try raids or at least fractals then. World bosses hardly give you gameplay.
---
Which deaths?
---
This doesn't really tell us anything about the episode itself...which might mean that something *big* happens early in the episode and they don't want to spoil it?
---
I’ve been waiting so anxiously for this release. I literally cried at the end of the last episode and I want to see what happens next so badly.
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
Unless you are, or act like, part of the hive mind, prepare to be downvoted...INTERNET POINTS!!!!
---
Wew.
---
"Super rare" doesn't give you actual  representation of loot chances. Actual chances more like "Not in your lifetime"
---
If you have HoT and LS3 you can also get ascended breathers from https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slooshoo
---
&gt; That and I hope they have a small teaser for S5 at the end.
---
They did at the end of last season, and I'm pretty sure the end of season 2 also had a heart of thorns teaser. Most likely they will for this one too.
---
Welp, I know what i'm doing next week.
---
I actually liked the rather melanchonic tone of the trailer. Given the (intentional?) abrupt end of Ep 5, I kinda wanted a proper continuation of the team grieving for a bit. The last line of "...but possibly the end of the beginning" made me think of the typical dramatic suspense SE \*dun dun duuuuuuh\*.
---
Here, I'm ctrl+c - ctrl+v part of my original post, that you seem to miss, so you don't need to guess
---
\&gt; They could've at least make achievement with some reward for killing some amount of bosses during event 
---
This way you can work toward something and bonus loot will be really bonus and not main attraction point of this event.
---
Open world? Who cares.
---
Instanced combat? Get your ass in melee and spread your love buffs all over your party members.
---
And yet people are getting the drops. Just like how people are getting the super rare drops from the black lion chests. 
---
Having an actual representation of loot chances is also quite pointless, since people in general wouldn't understand it anyway. Something having a 1% drop rate does not mean you will get it once ever hundred boxes, and people would whine about that as well.
---
And it's confirmed for the 14th now through other official channels so we are good to go!
---
So are we to assume we aren't getting a new raid wing? I don't play raids but still...
---
So why should they give great loot then?
---
Effort doesn't matter, it's time that's the issue.
---
They should not appear, but there should be a way there's more items there. 
---
Instead having no icon at all for hidden entries, there could be [the question mark icon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/4/44/Incredible_Reward.png), and no preview for the item, so people know there's something there.
---
I can't remember the last time any open world PVE zerg farm took any amount of effort on my part besides serpents ire...
---
It's all easy.
---
Yeah, it was pretty obvious, I didn't think of it \^\^
---
Poor Taimi...
---
It's screaming Fissure of Woe, but at the same time, I'm not sure they'd add a mists map to the game as an explorable area
---
Because having an automatic punishment system based on reports is stupid as hell?
---
Isn't stating May 14th in the video confirmation enough?
---
Oh
---
Oh and the game is now 50% off.. 
---
OOF
---
This. These are such boring events with only a few exceptions. This whole event just showcases how bad some of these events are compared to modern metas. How do you lure out the Shatterer? I don't know! You don't know! It just says we're luring it out and eventually it comes out when other players go do the pre-events that aren't telegraphed and take place nowhere near the battlefield. Why does Taidha do all her bullshit? I don't know! First-year game dev students don't know! Now shut up and wait an hour for your 20 silver!
---
Yeah, in a different game, I spent $200 in loot boxes trying to get one skin that I really wanted. Now you just have to spend a little bit of money to buy anything you want off of the gem store or currency exchange it into gold for the BLTP
---
*dies to mine at Escort*
---
FUCK
---
*banned*
---
I agree with you, this event is not good. World bosses are already pretty boring, so I'm glad it's unrewarding, but the fact anet thinks 1 rare for 15 minutes of my time is "Rewarding" is pretty concerning. I could go mine for 15 minutes and make more gold than an hour of doing world bosses even with this "Bonus".
---
Yeah, I could win the lotto and gain 2k+ gold, but getting a single green log/silver ore kills all motivation to keep trying for that uber rare drop. 
---
I'll stick to my consistent gold farms that don't disappoint me.
---
Btw.. GW2 is 50% off right now.  Might be a good time to take advantage just in case ;)
---
ty :)
---
It sure came way earlier than usual, and what's most surprising is that it isn't coming on tuesday. Early is good, let's hope it does not come with lots of undesired bugs.
---
This doesn't make any sense, the reason the majority of people do any type of PvE is for the drops be it uber rare or consistent gold/hour.
---
Pretty sure the reason is because it isn't the skin itself you need for the collection, but to bind that specific item. Throwing in the forge will unlock an item's skin if you didn't own it already, but for the elite spec collections (PoF), you specifically are required to bind the item to you. Pretty certain if you glance over the collection and hover over that specific item, it'll say to bind the named weapon skin in question.
---
I was expecting the release this tuesday instead of alter in the month. Mainly because NCsofts quarterly report is due tomorrow I think, and I expect Anet will need some good press after the earnings reports.
---
Her head is huge.
---
Only the best the whispers had
---
I don't play wvw.
---
People still do Gerent for crap rewards. Tons of people are still running the boss train in hopes of these ultra rare items. This is mindless unchallenging content. The rewards are fine for the effort needed. The "time invested" is 40-80% standing around waiting for an HP sponge to spawn.
---
It was enough confirmation for me but I saw some comments from people who thought the date in the video was wrong, so I wrote this comment as a second confirmation for those people.
---
They certainly made an effort and I really liked Zafirah’s performance and writing. The whole idea behind her character was great. 
---
Braham getting a redemption arc by them basically going “oh wait, he’s a Norn, he’d deal with it differently” after people pointed out how out of character he was for a crack in the ice was decent I guess. 
---
I’m also happy Taimi might actually face her ilness now and doesn’t just have it show up when it’s convenient to the plot and then forget it the rest of the time.
---
Blish and Gorrik were decent performance wise, but I found the whole thing with Blish’s death really forced and since we barely had any connection to him I couldn’t feel much. In fact they tried to make us feel for him by making the 2 characters with a bit more personality ( Taimi and Gorrik ) be sad about his death. I dunno, it felt off. 
---
I think the weakest character for me this season ( sadly ) was Aurene. Ever since her power boost they tried to keep her away from us, dealing with teenage dragon stuff and newfound powers and then had her swoop in every now and then. I personally felt like the connection we had with her prior kind of weakened throughout the season, and it made the finale less emotionally charged for me. I was disappointed, but not sad that she died. Was weird for me since everyone else seemed to cry their eyes out over her death.
---
Okay, Flaming Legion. Fuckface. First, take a big step back... and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE! Now, I don't know what kind of pan-Tyrian bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Ascalon, Elona, is my territory. So whatever you're thinking, you'd better think again. Otherwise I'm gonna have to head down there and I will rain down an ungodly fucking brandstorm upon you! You're gonna have to call the fucking Pact and get a fucking BINDING RESOLUTION to keep me from fucking destroying you. I am talking talking branded earth, motherfucker! I will massacre you. I will FUCK YOU UP!

Find out who that was.

1 green log and a rare for 15 minutes is not good enough.

Holy shit! I was not prepared for this!
---
Ah, so it is only an issue when it is for something you care about. Got it.
---
Also does anyone know if you purchase both xpacs if you get 2 serials.. or if it's just 1 serial with both xpacs on it?
---
Heres hoping we get zojja for this finale or to expensive to get felicia day?
---
the existence of rewards doesn't mean that that's what the game is about.
---
from Day 1, the devs philosophy has been to distinguish itself from the competition by doing things differently, like not focusing on loot but making the game play rewarding in-and-of-itself.
---
whether you personally enjoy playing a given event or content type doesn't change that.
---
I know about rng, that's why I'm so mad. Other game's events got something you can get with enough hours AND some rng reward for super lucky ones. This event however got only rng and nothing else. Why?
---
Infusions was a small part of what I said but apparently the only thing you could argue so...
---
Well of course it is. He was a high profile personality in the game with a good following. He'd be neglecting his own followers had he not made a video about why he was moving away from GW2.
---
Often times when starting gw2 i find myself humming the hot intro. That sound is really stuck in my head.
---
A game has never made me emotional but that music after knowing what happened just works. I wonder what its like for people who didn't play All or Nothing.
---
Its nice to be vindicated to be honest this morning I was starting to believe it would be the 21st.
---
Yes this sub is a bit of a hive mind unfortunately, but I understand where everyone is coming from.
---
I literally looked for ur post to give you props!

I killed them before from time to time. It's not like I killed them this much in so little time before.

The background voice at 1:17 is probably one of the best moments, you nailed it!

Very nice of you and thanks.

PRAISE

Add PoF to your shopping bag and go to Checkout to get the option to add HoT for 10 Euro.
---
Just a small Heads-up that the Shrine Guardian Jackal skin is currently available, about half a week left. =)
---
Start buying a stack of random sigils just in case!
---
Nah. They already said we would not be getting an open world map set in the Mists, and the new map looks absolutely nothing like the Fissure of Woe. I'd be very disappointed if it was too, because this is Kralkatorriks episode, not Balthazars again. He's already had more than enough screentime, LS3 and an entire expansion focused on him with PoF.
---
&gt;read books later
---
Books? What books? He burned all the books.
---
I just got the two xpac one and I can confirm its 1 single code for both!
---
And what I just saw is interesting: 
---
* the action takes place right after the previous episode (good, I personaly waited for this) 
---
* I'm not surprised that Gorikk is looking for an answer in some text
---
* I'm more surprised that Logan is obviously trying to find a solution too ! I've never seen it as a leader but here it's what he looks like. 
---
* I noticed a small glowing light in Caith's fingers. Does it mean that the link between her and Aurene still exists ? Does it mean our dragon is still here somewhere ? With the "end of the beginning" sentence... Possibly ?
---
* Taimi...) -: The beginning of the end ?
---
That was a really cool trailer but that sucks that there has been 2 trailers now with no word on a Legendary trinket. I really hope they just did not do it because of the raid ring. Really enjoyed Aurora.
---
I wouldn't mind a pre-Scarlet LA fractal. Maybe play as 5 robbers or smth, robbing a bank or some trading post place. Throw in some stealth skipping stuff like the lws2 story where you played as Caith and Faolain, and some Lionguard bosses with fun mechanics. And maybe make Ellen Kiel and Evon Gnashblade as bosses as they are some lionguard and black lion trading post dudes.
---
No I don't I think if Anet ever add the Fissure of Woe back they will make it a raid like it was in GW1 (I know they weren't called raids in GW1 but it was raid like). I am coming round to the idea of the map being in the mists and we fight Kralky with Aurene, Glint and Vlast. It would also be a good way to bring Destiny's Edge back together for the finally Kralky fight. They began the Kralky story in Edge of Destiny they need to be at the end.
---
This is actually only the case with named spearmarshal weapons. They share a skin with common spearmarshal crafted weapons, requiring them to be put in collections first. Weapons and armor normally automatically unlock when forged.
---
can always nitpick certain parts (like the weird sharpening animation?), but as a whole; it was pretty damn good... but that shouldnt really be a surprise; a lot of the lws4 trailers have been very well done
---
Also I goes so well with each character attitude. From Zafirah readying her weapons to Rytlock and Logan discussing battle plans, Taimi sad and Braham caring for her. It so good
---
Yes.  Just keep it well ventilated and keep an eye on the temperatures.
---
I'd say the commander needed time alone to process Aurene's death and Caithe feels likes now is the time to go to the commander and talk to him.  
---
At least that's how I interpreted Caithe's requiem bits about the commander ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
"The end, of the beginning"
---
Oh so Aurene and Vlast needed to die in order for this to play out. Where was that theory regarding their Ascension through death? Because that is looking more and more likely
---
I would love a fractal taking place during Scarlet's Attack. So you would start of pretty close to old LA, and would then as you progressed through the fractal, maybe attempting to evacuade some civilians or something similar, be present as it tranaforms into the destroyed variant. In my head the map would start on the old forge plaza, and then make it's way around the map, with paths becoming blocked by rubble, forcing the players to use some of the more hidden pathways. 
---
With the new focus of story-heavy fractals, I think it would be a waste not to do something like this, since the destruction was arguably the most impactful event of season 1.
---
For those players who were around when old LA was in game, it would be nice to see be able to return, though it would be in a somewhat guided path.
---
New players would be able to experience what started all of the Season 2.
---
Oh, I see your point now!
---
But to be honest, the Commander isn't too much at fault here. It was Glint - a prophet and Aurene's own mother - who time and time again told the Commander and Aurene that time was running out, that Kralkatorrik needed to be dealt with right now. The training session in Glint's Lair at the beginning of EP5 only reinforced that notion and basically instructed the Commander to make use of the Dragonsblood forge. 
---
I mean, yes, you could say that the Commander was naive for letting Glint rush him instead of going at his own pace. That this means the story should now take a darker turn in which the Commander laments having been naive and having rushed into battle at the command of another (Glint). 
---
But I think they're building up this less intricate narrative in which the Commander might FEEL stupid and guilty for Aurene's death but acted exactly in the right way by following Glint's prophecy, and thus does not have to actively work on himself.
---
I can see how the latter might seem less appealing than the former, but I am okay with Aurene coming back.
---
My personal wish, however, is for the Commander to not be fine with how he was an unknowing pawn in Glint's prophecies. I want him to be angry because he had to amass an army and unknowingly send it to doom just to make progress in fulfilling some sort of prophecy. I want him to shout at Glint that she should have told him everything, especially that Glint knew Aurene had to die in order to come back (assuming she does, which I take for granted. 
---
So yeah, I'd like some character growth/realism, too, but I strongly assume Aurene will be back and that Glint/the future will establish that "rushing it" was just part of the prophecy, not something with an alternative.
---
or they setup a base around the dead dragon
---
The real question. Who is zojja?, Faren gets more participation than her.
---
That huge "festival" plaza bothers me so much. The only festival something places there is Halloween and that's just some small decoration in the middle. At all other times it is just a huge empty space.
---
I can agree with the Aurene part. There was certainly a stronger connection in S3 when we played and trained with her, and in S4 that part wasn't done much justice, but I figure they had difficulties in repeatedly bringing that on-screen and then explaining convincingly why we were fighting a lot of battles without her.
---
But yes, I would have liked another moment of bonding. It felt weird to have Caithe tell us that Aurene loves us so much it hurts, yet not having had any indication for that ever since she escaped from Tarir and flew to Elon Riverlands to help us against Balthazar. (I am still intrigued how she would have done that in, probably ca. 15 minutes.) 
---
Aurene's death hit me, though. I was not bawling, but I was shocked and sad. I guess I just fed on what was previously established, even throughout S4.
---
Probably full-on Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.
---
"Wonderful gate. It WOULD be a shame if somebody blew a giant hole in it."
---
so if they implemented a "get loot" button on the UI, where all you had to do was click it and it instantly gave you a random legendary and 5million gold.. would you spend all day just pressing that button or would you want to go out and play content instead?
---
Now I'm pretty sure I'm being stupid here, but I can't seem to find the Install.exe file!  
---
[Here is a picture of the d912pxy folder and the ''installer'' folder](https://imgur.com/a/CjsVzNc)  
---
Any help would be very appreciated!
---
Not sure about genuinely caring but it is definitely easier for the majority of players to relate to something like map completion over something impressive but niche such as a low man kill of a raid boss. It is why meme posts get tonnes of upvotes while adding little to the sub, just appeals to more people.
---
Pick up a greatsword and go ham, fam. Fun part about ranger in this game is you're not actually just bound to bows!
---
It has to be something groundbreaking or spoilerrific. My bets are still all on it happening in the Mists, in a way, or somewhere huge (a guildie speculated maybe Fissure of Woe since it's called War Eternal and Balth is still kinda involved through his legacy)
---
I wonder why the name of the map is being kept from us. Maybe the name itself is a spoiler.
---
They didn't give the name of the new map either. I know they have revealed that alongside "new map" in the past. Seems like it is intentionally kept secret this time.
---
it is just kind of way to inflate the price of a +16 to +17 craft, without actually stating it. Though it does allow for some luck and "creativity", it is pretty much just a dumb hidden mechanic.
---
Where else is she supposed to store her massive brain?
---
Can I be bitter still about how badly Lazarus happened tho?
---
I mean, we coulda been all, "Hey this guy impersonated you and is killing your followers you should totes help us smoke him." And added a Mursaat to our team.  Wasted potential...
---
omfg a class that hits like a wet noodle and is built entirely around sustain can sustain, no way.
---
I was amused when, looking through wiki, saw that ranger can use greatsword.
---
While I understand that feeling, they've already established the world will end if they keep killing Dragons, but Kralk is also intent on feeding so much he may end existence. 
---
Simply put, the lore has (more or less) established that without Aurene (or some being similar), it is the end of all things
---
Since i'm focused on the story I went into HoT first.  As one stated it's best to experience the previous stuff as intended, as in not have a mount to make things convenient when they were not around when HoT was out.  But otherwise you could start PoF get the mount and then go back to HoT to follow the story.
---

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.

You don't need to be level 80 to use mounts once you unlocked them for your account. I agree, they probably didn't make it possible to use mounts in that instance.
---
Dragon Bash -&gt; Boss Bash, drop us some [Zhaitaffy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Piece_of_Zhaitaffy)!!

Oh, good to know! Havent made a new toon in ages.
---
First point is a bit too literal, the thrust of the generalization is that the internet crosses international and cultural boundaries... Some cultures would absolutely put the blame square on the parents while others would give some recognition to how crafty/devious kids can really be at times.  The national laws and cultural views will reflect this and complicate attempts to make intricate solutions.  Pointing towards your second point, a simpler solution would be preferable.
---
As for the politics, this is an example of capitalism finding an arena where the rules are nearly non-existent.  It wouldn't take much in any honest history book to see that any group of humans will quite readily resort to cruelty and exploitive practices if it means getting what they want quicker, easier or cheaper and it's that governments of capitalist nations will need to step in to ensure that the rights of their people are being maintained.  
---
Pointing back to my answer about point one though, the international nature of online games though, that's easier said than done... Which is why we will see many incredibly smug responses from the industry or their reps along the way.  Case in point being the one the article printed.
---
Fourth point, it's a bit of a nit-pick.  If talking officially, in official channels or even directly at a company about these things then the language is going to be very important.  Reddit isn't exactly a scholarly publication though and constantly repeating "In game containers that randomly generate drops which were obtained by, or opened via an item available that can be purchased for an intermediate currency that is non-refundable and has no real life transfer-back value" will get quite old.  For Guild Wars 2 specifically, the Black Lion Keys being available as in game drops, and gems being purchasable through rewards earned completely in game is simply legal "cover your ass" work so they can stand before a court and honestly say that nobody actually has to spend real money.  Nothing but legal games played through loopholes in poorly written laws as far as the eye can see.  All of which will need to be fixed or rewritten to truely solve the situation... For the country whose politicians are willing to put in the legwork.  
---
Fifth point:  Arguements can go either way on microtransactions in general.  I personally don't mind the concept, though.  It's all about how it's implemented.  It can be implemented in a way that keeps it out of the way of enjoying a game, which GW2's gem store was meant to be, or it can be done like Angry Birds Evolution which is very blatantly designed to annoy you into spending more money.  GW2's system is more fair than most but suffers from perception issues because there is a huge disparity between what you get through game content and what you get through the gem store, and in the difference between dropping some cash to gems versus farming gold for gems.  
---
There are too many factors to go over here that play into it also.  But an incomplete list are investor expectations versus reality, players trying something and going back to their tried and true, games having horrible and buggy releases that kill interest in them for the long term, etc.  
---
As for no microtransactions?  There you're looking at an expansion driven game like GW1, which should be perfectly feasible but likely will never live up to bloated investor expectations that come from years of leeching off this current tumor of a market. (So an otherwise great project will get cut or simply transitioned into the microtransaction model by the ones who hold the purse strings of the development studios)
---
looks retarded lol
---
Maybe put out Lionguards around LA, give rng way (like swamp orbs) four of them keys, put 4 players to steal them and put one player making their way to some trading post vault, when the keys been stolen the vault player can break in to the vault which would trigger a waypoint to the others to come back, then some cool vault breakin gameplay ocean's eleven style, main vault champ fight, get out oh shit Ellen Kiel + Gnashblade duo endboss. Just a quick fractalcraft (is this an acceptable word) I made up.
---
I believe that was an unintended glitch. I mean the creation of some skin or infusion effect through an achievement and crafting process with the future of level 500 jewel crafting perhaps.
---
Some are also graphics dependant, like chalice.  I cannot see these little cracks and crevices I'm aiming for.  It's a smooth brown slab but only part of it can be stood on.
---
The music in the trailer is so heart breaking and sad and beutiful i just cried my heart out to this trailer. I am so looking forward to see what will happen and were we go from here.
---
Ok this was cool as hell, please share how you did this lol. Stranger things theme too XD
---
Yeah, they could just have a sort of menu toggle to show all items.
---
Are you able to tell if the sword will have a blade trail? Would love for it to acctually have one, despite trailer not lookingbpromising in that aspect. :)
---
&gt;My personal wish, however, is for the Commander to not be fine with how he was an unknowing pawn in Glint's prophecies.
---
That isn't really how prophesies work though. The way you worded this, Glint crafted this scenario, when in reality it was one of many that would potentially already happen. 
---
And the commander has *seen* the prophesies, or at least some of them. Once you see a thing, you can alter it. Instead they went full force into it.
---
Just ignore the scrapper and get the other points.  Most of the time they just camp one point.
---
The time has come and so have I.
---
It's really useful in pvp, and I dont feel like swapping keybinds for a daily I already dont want to do :P
---
there aren't any meta "full ranged" dps pve builds
---
Oh dang right, how did I forget about that one?
---
You get some WvW hype spike if there is an update (like mounts) and then it dissipates again.
---
Never in GW2.
---
Very specifically I would like a fully explorable version of it back. If it has to be an instance, so be it, but I want to go everywhere...
---
...WITHOUT:
---
1. 4 other party members dogging me to stop gallivanting and move on to the next fractal
---
2. Mobs
---
3. Too much added particle effects, post processing, destruction, obstruction, anything that prevents us from seeing the old place as it once was
---
What would be fine:
---
1. Renewed NPCs.
---
2. Being instanced ---OR
---
3. Being a yearly event (where LA goes back in time)
---
I think the guild hall is a great idea.
---
Never? not because i do not like the idea.
---
But they actually use colors to differ some of the same modeled weapons...so i think this is very much unlikely to see
---
Interesting. Thank you for your time.
---
That doesn't apply to the bouncy chest and the world chest. You only get the chest from the achievement.
---
You can actually change what music plays during the game, everything from character select music to ambient night time music, to any music as long as you have the mp3
---
we already have that, but you can get the currency anywhere. it's karma
---
Thank you so much! Hope you enjoy my other videos too :) Yeah, it's definitely a matter of taste... I also needed some time to get used to that kind of sound back in the day XD
---
The trailer seems to be capturing the events within the first few hours following the end of the previous episode. The requiem pages cover the time gap between then and now.
---
This trailer is aimed to set up the upcoming chapter without giving away anything about this upcoming chapter. It only recaps past events + asomber narration and musical theme. An interesting choice aimed toward existing and up-to-date players rather than wide audience appeal.
---
(I like it)
---
Aurene, Vlast, and Glint could replace Zhaitan, Mordremoth, and Kralkatorrik. I wonder if that's the angle Anet is going for.
---
Funny thing is, a fall in the mist would probably look like this until stepping back on stable ground.
---
I really need to start exploring more and catalog these places
---
I never made it all the way to the top, but the first time I took a port up there, I stopped and watch YouTube videos for 15 minutes and got it first try.  There’s at least one reliable strat out there.
---
This, but with world completion mixed in instead of first.
---
I love this game so, so much
---
Requiem on Guild Chat this Friday–~~we want your questions!~~ we want your unimportant fluff questions!
---
Type one: sexy armor
---
Type two: more complicated and not quite as sexy version of the armor, but we're still going to unlock it anyway
---
It's mostly tolerated. A ton of people got a mastery in desert highlands by map breaking.
---
Abusing it (e.g. if you found a way to get into a HoT map meta end room to get rewards without completing the meta, and did so repeatedly) would be punished.
---
There is. Having to watch youtube to have a chance is no fun either!
---
For me its probably a three way tie between Queensdale, Plains of Ashford, Wayfarer Foothills, and Metrica Province. Each has their own settings and designs which go with their respective races.  Plains of Ashford has a special place for me, being a veteran of guild wars 1.
---
How often to mount skins cycle through the store? There is a griffon skin on there right now that I really, really want but I don't have the griffon unlocked yet (working on it). Debating on if I should wait until I actually have the mount and wait for the skin to cycle back through, or bite the bullet and buy it now.
---
At least half of gw2 veterans wants old LA back what are you talking about?
---
You're probably right, just seems there are way more people playing than in normal farms or during festivals, and people seem to be expecting free infusion drops.
---
Actually it's almost double loot for the events, the second half having a higher chance to yield refined materials instead of mithril and being repeatable. 
---
What I don't get is that WB are usually not deserted content... So when loot is half no one complains and do it but when doubled it becomes a loss of time...
---
Now I personally haven't joined too much of the event because I prefer gather some mats from living world maps currently . So my selfish suggestion for the reward would be to get a choice between crafting, season 3 or season 4 mats so that I could participate while keeping my priorities.
---
A few months maybe, nobody really knows.
---
and the mordant weapon skins in the same collections provide a nice contrast
---
if you hover over the mordant skins item in the collection it is the same as if you were hovering over them in the wardrobe while hovering over the sunspear weapons give the full item description
---
Gray infusions (Condi) already dropped by like 160 which is great because I wanted to pick up more for other stats. Supply went up and that's all that matters.
---
... Now if only the parts to stat swap them were available again too qq
---
&gt; With the current drop rate, you are NOT going to see the prices drop in any meaningful way at all.
---
To be fair, the [Queen Bee](https://www.gw2spidy.com/item/81701) sell price dropped almost 2400gold in the past few days.
---
It means we're going to the Mists to fight there with Glint/Aurene/etc at our side.
---
Transfering to NA server would be better.
---
I doubt this is a likely change we will ever see. GW2 is just not setup in the same way for dyeing weapons. Think of something like the SAB weapons which each set have a distinct colour difference.
---
Maybe they could limit what parts of the weapon you could dye, but in some cases that would defeat the purpose of wanting to dye your weapon.
---
Most likely, yes. Or it might even spoil the setup for season 5
---
True, it's as if it took people 7 years to realize that 4 world bosses per hour is actually a waste of time.
---
Living in the past world.
---
sounds like just me and my boys when we drunk!
---
People were losing their minds in awe at the Skipping Stones JP? Damn, they really must not have done many JP's. There's so many other more awe inspiring JPs like Scavenger's Chasm, or Drydock Scratch, or Obsidian Sanctum!
---
How do you square those positions?  You like prohibition but you oppose prohibition?  That makes no sense.
---
I suspect it's because you think there's no harm in one or you personally like it, and you either think the other is "bad for you" or you don't care one or the other about it so it's okay to ban it.
---
That's not a rational way to make policy.
---
Garmarna and In Extremo got me hooked up to that type of vocals pretty quickly. Back to the channel now, love your vocals :)
---
Bc they aged her up by increasing the size of her model instead of using the height slider approach the game would offer. 
---
Also big head = more cuteness and Anet likes using Taimi for that.
---
whyd u put a space? u mean penis mighter than the sword
---
Ah, sweet!  I've posted a few times here that I expect to see Aurene come back in a different and more powerful form, even if just in the Mists.  The foreshadowing in the trailer all but confirms this as a certainty.  Woooooooo!  Fuck you, Kralk!!
---
You indeed cannot use mounts in personal story instances.  The only instance that was updated to allow mounts was the one in the black citadel for the warclaw.  All others so far have been untouched (including HoT instances)
---
What if I told you there are two other jumping puzzles in Caledon Forest besides Morgan's spiral and its follow up; AND a 5th unfinished jumping puzzle/mini dungeon that can be accessed with some clever jumping!
---
&gt;  or seems to switch between ranged and melee
---
because for various fights you will screw up the mechanics otherwise 
---
which also means the answer to this is no
---
&gt; Is there a class or build that does really well as full time ranged?
---
unless you want to be the jerk purposely screwing up fights
---
Yeah, that's what i thought. Like the puzzle is neat but there are way more impressive ones.
---
Back then I thought the event was bad
---
These days I wish there wouod be
---
Every single player will mash that button for god who knows how many hours. Why are you deluding yourself, most of players complete content only for rewards.
---
Is there a hybrid option for those that do it, hate it and would rather have better balance, but are also lacking skill to use anything else?...
---
Becuase that would be me.
---
&gt; Open world? Who cares.
---
That depends ... even in open world there are fights where staying at range can cause fights to drag out much longer. For example certain bounty targets and especially when combined with certain modifiers.
---
I really like how, between the last few lines of this and the shift in musical tone at the end of the trailer, it concludes with a faint sense of hope - something that the story has been distinctly lacking for some time now. Here's hoping that hope pays off, and we get a proper conclusion to the current arc at the end of E6, rather than another cliffhanger or sudden twist to make it all seem pointless.
---
What do you mean by the old jump system? Been playing the JP's since the beta and never noticed any change to how jumping works...
---
you sound just like my english teacher, they interpeted my uncles book with metaphors and what not. i asked my uncle if it was true and he said he was just high af that time.
---
Actually I think that they made this event for new players to be aware that world bosses exist because it's a content you would easily miss now with all the expansions and seasons.
---
On a more conspiratorial approach I wonder if this is not a stress test in disguise for the next things to come or an evaluation of the economical impact of WB in general with a long term project being to re evaluate their reward.
---
[Here is the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsifLPFAxjE)

The only place we may have seen the new map is in the legendary and skyscale previews. It looks somewhat desert in theme so not sure if it is that far north. One theory is that it is in the mists, perhaps the Fissure of Woe or maybe even involving the Aetherblades. I'm starting to think there may be more than one map, even if only one is explorable and the others are story only like Fahranur.
---
This is what I did. The Raptor is so helpful.
---
This music is good, but it doesn't quite suit how I'm going to climb Kralkatorric like a fucking mountain, using my axes like climbing picks, and keep swinging until he's a pile of purple fucking gravel and there isn't a god, devil, or damned bar wench that'll stop me.
---
Power Berserker gang gang.
---
And even if you go berserk with best in slot, it doesn't take long to get once you've played for a while. Kitted out a Holosmith in ascended armor, weapons, and trinkets last night. Took almost an hour to do.
---
Guild Wars 2 strikes as built entirely around the experience of playing and the achievements within gameplay, not achieving gear levels.
---
You can sometimes sword block aura ticks. The solution to this is you need to delay the sword 4 shockwave block by a tiny bit, ensuring that even if you block something else, the blocking window is still up when the shockwave hits.
---
when its over the price of a ecto.
---
I like extra free stuff anyway
---
Given we've seen portals into the past of moments repeating themselves over and over, there actually is this possibility. It could also be another interpretation of Aurene's vision of dying over and over. She keeps dying to keep Kralk trapped in a time loop (and no wonder she freaked out).
---
But either way it's definitely tied into the mists
---
So you want to see how old LA looks like when the servers are down? 
---
Because that's the devoid husk you're asking for.
---
There can still be dyeable weapons and dye channels along weapons with different color schemes and the same overall skin.
---
For example, take Ascended weapons, they have 3 main colors: The main color, the detail color, a the glow color.
---
It would be possible to have 1 or 2 of those colors dyeable, while keeping the rest the same. 
---
Sab weapons? Keep the color of the transparent holographic bits the same: Red, blue, green, yellow, etc, while making handles dyeable.
---
I just discovered this:
---
http://gw.zweistein.cz/gw2ecto/
---
They don't take into account the other materials you get though, so for wood and mithril you can probably add a couple silver.
---
Lately, I've been selling any rare that is more than about 21 silver, though ectos have taken a bit of a dive due to the boss event.  I'm not quite optimal on this, but on the other hand, I'm not worried about losing a small amount of profit for convenience.
---
Salvage rate of ectos is still 0.9 with a rare level salvage kit, so you could factor in the price of ecto, the raw mats, and lucent motes.
---
Livin’ in a lonely world
---
Glint shared some "secret" information about Ascension with Aurene after the trials in EP5. 
---
The wording was: "Some things about Ascension can only expressed between dragons." 
---
Some players took that as Aurene having ascended in that time, others believe dragons might have to die in order to ascend.
---
I don't think it's real tbh
---
185% of the vets hate old LA, didn't you know?
---
[deleted]
---
Okay, now I'm definitely getting it
---
She's just trying to get white sharpness cause her shots are bouncing off of Krakkalakka's skin and she doesn't have ESP/Mind's Eye
---
It was even more ridiculous before they nerfed mounts so that their dmg ability would scale down in low level areas.
---
you could easily oneshot a bunch of mobs just by demounting the raptor before.
---
Why are we getting our news through Facebook?
---
Can't wait to see how the other skills from all the classes look like
---
I don't like PvP very much. But I love legendary armor.
---
So, considering I want the most efficient way possible, I would have to use the 9 season option.
---
With that I would play on each season 214 / 9 = 24 hours per season.
---
Considering each season is open for 8 weeks (I think?), that would mean playin 25 minutes of PvP per day in average. 
---
Sound doable! I'm tempted.
---
you know that meme about how greatsword gets the most love? yeh this is reinforcing that... dont get me wrong; im really really happy for these special skill changes (past projectiles), just weird that anet do it on a GS
---
Where does this come from?
---
People misunderstood bro
---
i hope she's next in line to be killed off
---
Yes I agree
---
Wonderful trailer style.
---
I kept pushing back my release date predictions and now we get this. I'm so happy it's coming sooner than when I was worried it would. Exordium is that much closer to being mine!
---
Unless there’s something more, I’m stil gonna have to lean towards Eternity a little
---
*G U I L D     W A V E*
---
Paolo Coelho disagrees
---
More like eternal chest runs
---
Meanwhile im here hoping they added a trail to Claw of Khan-Ur...
---
Scrapper is more active than firebrand/scourge. Lmao, nearly two years of FB/Scourge being the meta, scrapper becomes good and we got people
---
bitching within a month.
---
Like, I’m sorry, did ya’ll prefer to stand in AoEs and stare at your UI? or did you prefer watching the enemy team constantly auto-rez while tanking 3 players, get all boons, and have constant stab?
---
Scrapper is just a less toxic FB
---
seems like this article is the source:

Looks like this came from MMOBomb:
---
https://www.mmobomb.com/news/arenanet-drops-new-trailer-gw2s-war-eternal-lands-may-14/
---
I still think your point is valid. It's got both aspects
---
We're in Endgame now...
---
Thanks!
---
If this legendary shifts it's look around, that will be quite cool
---
Because there's an ignore feature.
---
Can you link NSP discord please?
---
Yeah this is how youtube works as well. You can upload a video but not list it until it's ready, that way a video can be uploaded in advance but delivered exactly when the creator wants it shown (like vloggers who do weekly shows on set days).
---
I've never crafted a legendary. Should I start with this one?
---
Supply vs demand is always a big part of the price. No one really knows how the price will change. My take on it would be that the price should stay roughly the same if not drop slightly
---
This event's infusion drop rate is not the cause of that...I can tell you that. There's a reason for that, and it's psychological, not economical.
---
Next elections vote Evon Gnashblade
---
I hope the trailer is canonical. This one didn't really do a whole lot of story, but it had decent production values and I want them to squeeze as much story into them as possible. Maybe that way we will end up with less 20 min unskippable monologues in the middle of story instances.
---
a good scrapper gets shat on by any competent gank, hence why you see maybe one, at most two scrappers at plat/legend levels. Source: any PvP streamer covering ATs/high level play.
---
The original is one of my definite favourites from the SAB soundtrack so I hope I did it justice.
---
I will try to contact them and ask them but even if they dont refund i am totally okay with that and its understandable.
---
&gt;!"I am inevitable."!&lt;
---
&gt;!"And I ... am Aurene-Man"!&lt;
---
Considering us gays have been equated with the "death of society" by the less-accepting for many years now, a class dealing in death is very fitting.
---
But nice try anyway!
---
That's a fair response. Thanks.
---
K jar jar
---
This is one of the worst kinds of shitpost I've seen to date...and that says a lot.
---
you can use a waypoint or vista to 'reset" the lag without logging out.
---
&gt; [Mesmers Disabled]
---
Then JP's simply wouldn't get done, and Anet loves their data. 
---
Anet Peon: "Look Boss, They're Participating!". Boss: "Good Job!".
---
Take out the mesmers and suddenly daily JP's would be trivial because a rather large number of people would simply not bother.
---
Anet Peon: "Boss, they don't like that content". Boss: "You're Fired!".
---
As I've stated numerous times over the years: the gen 2 greatsword will get the most love and care across all the gen 2 legendaries, because ANet simply has a massive bias towards the weapon.
---
Thanks you so much! I've been losing a lot of golden for months, used to sell when was 80s or more before.
---
The video said the 15th?  I sure hope it's the 14th....i have that day off work!
---
Fair
---
They might be pulling a fast one but I really don't expect her stay dead (or at least not dead as in gone).
---
Coming back from death is not unheard of in GW. The commander did that recently and there are lots of sentient undead.
---
Glint also took Aurene aside to privately talk about Ascension and Aurene was afraid of what Kralk would make of her, not death (that was the commanders fear).
---
I'm in a 2500 person Destiny Discord and we've never had issues
---
I don't disagree, except that psychology is a HUGE factor for any economy.
---
This is the best trailer for this season by far. Its long, music is great, and you can feel the pain. I prefer this kind of trailer instead one that longs for 1 minute and you only see 5 seconds of each new feature.
---
being able to double equip the same legend is my dream rev change; double malyx, double ventari, double shiro
---
Well that settles what song I'm going to use for my season 4 recap AMV
---
And gets immediately shown up by someone who walks in with Legendary + Ad Infinitium and 3 Infusions as well as Winter's Heart.
---
Porting to eggs doesn't seem very useful unless you can put one end of the portal midair
---
Fantastica, grande!
---
When I google the error you get, it says that it might be caused by adblock, because the picture have "ad" in it.   
---
I find that weird though, considering I also have ad block and Ublock running without it being any issues.
---
Ok, that was a great response.
---
Thanks for 100 upvotes!
---
"I'm so proud of this community"
---
My boyfriend's (male human) Necro looks like a go-go dancer
---
Not necessarily. Base game is what people baught before there were expansions. You can access everything that doesn't come with the expansions. F2P players have certain restrictions. With a base game account you can still log in for daily rewards for example, which F2P accounts can't. 
---
I'm not sure if there's a way to officially buy the base game without expansions currently but there have been promotions where codes were given away that unlocked the base game but no expansions (example: Kung Fu Tea Promo). A lot of people tried to farm these codes because they are valuable due to the possiblity of log-in rewards.
---
Because they can't just randomly take someones piece of art?
---
In her sugma
---
If story is important, I’d recommend Season 2, then start Heart of Thorns. Seasons 2 &amp; 3 are also on sale if you buy the bundles right now. There’s a ton of great story content between both of them.
---
Do radial and arc work though? I thought I saw somewhere arc was working but I cant remember where.
---
More activities would be a good start. Some race events, some PvP duel zones, etc.
---
They could simply contact the artist in question and have him or her draw a new piece or be offered a means to have an existing one shared officially?
---
It's awesome! Really hyped for the episode, keep up the great work!
---
Underwhelming if you ask me.
---
We got zero idea of what's ahead.
---
There is what appears to be a third and different form of Exordium in the buffed.de article. I'm fine with greatsword getting lots of love and attention but it would be nice if that extended to other legendaries occasionally. Not every profession can run greatsword after all.
---
Did they get rid of the "living world" when lake doric came out? I feel like I remember there being an explanation of each map takes place at it's own time to explain how queensdale, divinity reach, and lake doric all show the city differently.
---
Lucky soab.
---
Yas.
---
They don't give a damn about their own guidelines when there's dozens of literal cam girls all over their "videogame streaming platform".
---
Weird. I run adblock on firefox but not on chrome. Chrome is only installed when i have a problem with a site in firefox.
---
A brand new body is disease free for sure!
---
Mean....they already did that with the tease trailer xD
---
yeah... you always hope to catch stuff like this before hitting production but this is such a small defect. No biggie
---
Oh boy, it’s Crimes Johnson again...
---
Oh, we both know perfectly why. The knights of tolerance excel at intolerance, after all.
---
Because they're made to suck on purpose, with dumb limitations and restrictions.
---
Keg Brawl was 24/7/365 at release, and they changed it to Sundays only after release for some dumb reason they still haven't bothered to justify properly.
---
The game is defined by achievements, collections and currency systems.  People aren't supposed to get precursors, infusions and 10g+ skins often.  The game is meant to build habits and get players to invest time in goals.  Uber rare drops aren't really a huge incentive for most players because people are pretty well grounded in probability these days.
---
We can't know for sure. If you're talking about the Nightfang then it's possible that the next time we see it will be around Halloween (worst case).
---
Two days before I've got a final paper due and a week before finals, damn it. Guess I'd better get a lot of work done this weekend, because come Tuesday, my ability to focus will be going out the window. So hyped!
---
Yeah, considering gsword is like the best weapon for DPS for nearly everyone who uses it, then sword is the 2nd best and now axe since POF gave tons of love to axes. A shame other weapons are pretty neglected...
---
Scenario 1:  Guy takes his shirt off to fight.  It's a (attempted at least) display of manlyness and such.  
---
Do you fight?
---
Scenario 2:  Same douche canoe now takes his pants off and wants to fight.  
---
Still wanna fight?  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaZUn7ps_W4
---
The fact they did a teaser trailer for features and a this actual trailer with story pleases me greatly
---
Maybe all what we need is a small bonus box for completing puzzles normal way, without using mesmer services and keeping this possibility of getting daily objective done by using portal for those who are in the hurry?
---
I was strong proponent of including jumping puzzles in new dailies, since with monthly removal this game feature was lying alone and squeaking but seeing people are using portals even for simple stuff like yesterday's Crimson Plateau on Diessa Plateau just makes me sad
---
Very this. Theres like a dozen characters that get added in living story that aren't in the personal story. You're going to be jumping into the middle of your relationship with them if you start straight into HoT.
---
I'd love for Revenant to eventually get GS...especially with this aesthetic
---
&gt; I miss the login screen from betas
---
You and me both. Just the track was something that gave me goosebumps.
---
It also gave me the impression that ArenaNet was also breaking the rule there already, every MMO had a fcking launcher and GW2 (though still beta) opened up with this screen which made it much more exciting.
---
Yeah Verdant Brink was terrifying running through when HoT first came out, constantly avoiding packs of Mordrem and dinos.
---
I literally linked the post from the original creator, where he says
---
&gt;**How it will work with ArcDPS/gw2hook/ReShade/GW2Radial?**
---
&gt; It should work fine with ArcDPS/GW2Radial/ReShade by now, but not gw2hook.
---
I run these JPs all the time like they are nothing lol. I thought after mounts were put out that they fully blocked off the unfinished JP? Also, I wish they would just release that one... because it looks so cool.
---
I just want to laugh at ANET so hard if this passes. The entire game is built on rng BS.
---
Also, it probably fits the fact that she has a degenerative disease.
---
If you do, I advise crafting shards for an off-hand weapon (Shards of Friendship, Shards of the Dark Arts, etc) and converting them over into the shards for this weapon. It will save you a lot of time/money, and headache
---
Hands down, my favorite.
---
Calling it right goddamn now (and have been calling it since Episode 5 alternating with bouts of uncontrollable crying for my sweet baby girl) We're gonna Perseus this bitch, go into the Underworld, and physically bring Aurene the hell back. I bet you 100 gold ore. Yes, you.
---
Daggers! Where your choice is flames with edgy skulls or flames with edgy charr. How fun.
---
Don't know what you mean. Xiuquatl is awesome.
---
You absolute madman
---
100% it also completely bypasses the whole point of masteries. Getting the glider then seeing if you should do jumping mushrooms next or keep going on glider. Then figuring out different ways to progress through the map.
---
Congradulations on failing successfully! \o/
---
I only believe in surprises! From the little information that dropped today for the new episode each profession/ES that can weild Exordium may get something special? Hue hue hue.
---
And I love legendary trails too, yet this Legendary may have a interesting bag of tricks, so there may be a trade off for the lack of that effect... What we get on may 14th is it!
---
 
---
The only assumption I'm okay with saying is I don't think Exordium will have boring visuals. And maybe ArenaNet should go back to other legendarys to update the quality, Rodgort just makes me sad okay?
---
My most sincere and cordial thank you to everyone involved! I and so many other players love you and your work!
---
Mounts are not disabled in there so it has actually become very easy.
---
Haven't played in over a year.. but after seeing this ... hmm ... I need it.
---
Oh hell, I might actually craft it after seeing all the skills past release
---
I don't mind that tbh
---
Thank you for the answer. Would you please be so kind and tell me how to do it? Or link me how to proceed to craft those shards for an off-hand? Thanks in advance.
---
They can go with
---
!"And We... are Dragon's Watch"!
---
yeah so just let the kids gain a gambling addiction because their parents suck, why didn't i think of that before.
---
Do you think the leg will transform for each individual class?
---
That would be so awesome then and much better than some people though
---
Do we already know if the new dragon mount will be a gold sink like the griffon or just a cheap collection like the roller beetle? or both?
---
the less gambling in videogames, the better for everyone involved. it's a bottomless pit and a cancer on the industry
---
Buy one a eco on one account, create free account and buy the other. That way you should get email two codes right?
---
I agree
---
More amusing is they fact they can use axes ... to throw
---
The design of this reminds me of a keyblade for some reason
---
Nice cock.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards
---
To shorten it, you will need 290 of a given shard to craft your Legendary. This method will create 300 shards from 400 offhand shards. You'll make 100 of something like Shard of the Dark Arts which is half the cost of a 2 handed weapon's shards, then convert for 75 shards.
---
You do this 4 times and save a couple hundred gold/a dozen or so hours in getting Elder Wood and Mithril
---
I would go on with the story, buying the living world season 3 chapters I don't own, then do PoF Story and then buy the Living world season 4 chapters and do those. I always prefer doing story first as it is quintessencial for some collections or mounts. 
---
Path of Fire maps are kinda deserted, yes, but if you persist you'll always find a group doing some metas during the weekends, it's not that hard, just requires patience. 
---
Domain of Istan (LS4-1) has a rewarding meta that people farm. Also silverwastes and HoT metas.
---
And [here](https://youtu.be/PTf-xTSCmPk?t=31) you have them in video.
---
Glad you like it! Subversiveasset (who I collabed with) really nailed the sax performance.
---
Right After AP test too!
---
I don't always nitpick, but in that case, Mordremoth was a consciousness that permeated an already existing jungle. His vines sort of count, though.
---
So the idea is more like, having a new map that actually takes place on a real, biological body/organism. 
---
However, I kind of feel like this would feel very stupid if actually attempted. I can accept cities on flying turtles, but I don't want an entire map set on a dragon's back. Unless he is dead.
---
Well yes, Elegy is type one and Requiem is type two.
---
Annnddd I made a typo, I meant to type "complex."
---
thanks, how nice of you
---
I think this is only Medium and Heavy , Female and male variants.
---
Big if true!
---
Senzu Bean!
---
But if it’s a question mark...how can I know if it’s lustworthy?? Plus people can just google it at that point right? So it’s not a real mystery, just an inconvenience 🤷‍♂️
---
Glad I am not the only one! She's got a lot of potential.
---
This would be huge!! But maybe they have a reason for making us go to the bank? I dunno
---
This sounds like a bad argument that was used against child labor laws.  I'd be careful thinking in such absolute idealistic terms.  Nuance does exist...
---
**Anything essential...**
---
I'd start by doing the story in order upto the end of Path of Fire since this gets you the four entry-level mounts; Raptor, Springer, Skimmer and Jackal - these will make sure you can access all the areas in the LWS4 maps.
---
Imo the [Roller beetle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Roller_Beetle) mount (LWS4 episode 3) is a must have since its super fast on flat/downward slopes + fun to use once you get used to it.
---
**Events..**
---
Most of the dynamic events in PoF are geared towards being completed by smaller groups, so you should manage fine with most events for the most part. The big metas (e.g. Casino Blitz in Crystal Oasis + Serpents' Ire in Vabbi) + bounty events (from any bounty board, there are a few marked on each map) still need larger groups with some coordination to succeed.
---
The difference with PoF was that the rewards from the metas are not that great in comparison to HoT and so there's not much reason to visit each map once you've done the related achievements. The PoF maps are significantly bigger than HoT - which was required due to the speed at which mounts cover ground - which means that players are more spread out + the maps may seem emptier.
---
Thanks for the advice. I picked up the chapters I was missing since they were on sale. I am glad to hear they are worth doing, they were alot of fun when I last played. 
---
Is there a particular reason that the PoF maps are not as populated as the HoT ones?
---
I know that after mounts were added they did put in additional walls that blocked off the normal route into the unfinished one, but I have heard that there are still ways to get in there, though I have not personally been back there since the introduction of mounts.
---
Hey @megai2, even though I never used your application, I want to commend you for your outstanding effort and work!
---
Is possible, can you clarify to me if, after d912pxy is installed, will it work when launching the game through gw2 launch buddy? Will I have to configure anything else?
---
Thanks.
---
Erect if correct!
---
&gt;push the conversation
---
A yes, "We started a conversation!". When you fucked up but don't want to admit it, so you act like your fuck up was intentional to create controvery.
---
The all inclusive excuse for any and all idiocy.
---
Same reaction here
---
They did update the lover and kudzu once.
---
Black lion chests definitively, yes.
---
Who composed the music for it, though? Chris Burgess?
---
That's wonderful. Please consider sending that to Anet, because who knows!
---
:)
---
you mean to YEET them?
---
The new Supply Drop package thing made me believe we'd be waited another two weeks. This is quite a nice surprise &lt;3
---
HYPE TRAIN 🚂
---
As an Imani main, you're officially the worst :P
---
But in all seriousness, I definitely agree. I miss it something fierce and there isn't anything quite like it right now.
---
I had a similar experience back when vanilla d/d ele was the meta. Went far, their ele went to their home. We fought for 2 minutes at 70% hp then sat and chatted the rest of the time. The point stayed contested and neither of our teams ever +1ed us, so it was a nice chat.
---
In the video War Eternal Arrived this May post, there is a point at 36 seconds where you can see spikes/mountainshapes through the window of the airship. I think it looks like Kralk’s back with large scales/spikes. I haven't seen anyone else mention this, especially on that other post with the actual video a couple weeks back.
---
Is that what it's called now? I only played Freedom Unite and (fan translation of) Portable 3rd
---
Don't throw those away, feed them to gobblers.
---
New Map -- "Cantha, Bitch"

^^^^^Imagine ^^^^^seeing ^^^^^"Cantha, ^^^^^Bitch" ^^^^^on ^^^^^the ^^^^^world ^^^^^map

If i get my dragon back, ill also have 4k gems on my acc. Just sayin.
---
WHY THE BARE MIDRIF? sigh...
---
There was that one time in WoW where you fought a raid encounter on Deathwing's Spine. That was pretty massive, and he even spun around if you lingered on one side of his back for too long.
---
It's unpopular because you're trying to force your playstyle on everyone else, rather than just playing how you want and letting everyone else play how they want.  Some random person using their griffon as soon as they enter a new map does not affect you in the slightest.
---
Greatsword are usable by almost all clases. So yes, its very practical for a first legendary.
---
Do the exam first, let all the launch bugs get worked out. Then jump in.
---
Wondering this myself.  I deactivated my Facebook account earlier this year; got a captcha prompt instead of the video.
---
That was an amazing trailer! Loved the emotion y'all put into it, especially in the facial animations. Bravo!
---
His contribution to "creating" that kid was 5 minutes of flopping around. The woman's is 9 months of pain and bodily changes. The contribution is not equal, so why should their says be equal? Abortion is a medical procedure that only the woman is undergoing, not the man. Therefore it's her choice and her choice alone on whether or not to get one. Again you don't get to make a medical choice for someone else just because you had sex with them.
---
Morally, of course a healthy couple should discuss their options together! But legally, the woman should have the final say on her own body and her own medical choices.
---
Or you're part of the heist that steals all the gold from the LA bank during the attack on LA. I don't believe they really explored that avenue.
---
I said several times, stop eating these Maguuma mushrooms!
---
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on the Switch, the various areas are on living moving Titans. It's on my list of games I really need to get and play, but money is tight.
---
jps will defo get done i mean there isn't one thats hard unless you're missing a brain
---
Ok, that actually makes a lot of sense with meme status of necro in this game, I'll take that. The official color of decay and degeneracy is rainbow now.
---
Life before death my friend.
---
I believe thats when they said it. But going back to events like toxic tower people would complain about it still being....toxic. I think they decided screw it.
---
Sugma dick
---
&gt;It turns out that the named weapons only count towards the achievements when they have been account or soulbound
---
afaik those weapons need to be "added to collection" account/soul binding just unlocks a skin. In this case the sunspear weapons share skins with the named versions need for the elite weapon collections.
---
Minis work the same way afaik. I remember doing the fractal golem mini collection and it turns out if you dont make a extra golem at each step to "add to collection" you get screwed because the mystic forge doesnt add this things to collections. The newer mount minis from the bl chests work the same way.
---
Pve legendary has unique skin and in/out of combat transformation. Pvp/wvw ones have same skin like precursors.
---
I wish all revenant weapons would be act like that
---
Wow thanks for the tl,dr. I'll do it asap. 🙂
---
Login rewards too
---
and thanks a lot for sharing it with us :D
---
Glad you like them, do not hesitate to come say hi in our discord (link in video description)
---
the one I'm referring to is engineer, and I also tried thief. neither of which really works in wvw (my preferred end game mode). engi because it's basically too good at being a support and sacrifices dps to do that, thief because it's more of a single target dps class. I wound up making a warrior when I got pof and really like warrior.

The new map can be seen here in the [Skyscale reveal trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQRFccP_DYg), and the rocky islands and jungle assets definitely resemble the area south of Mount Maelstrom.

Please, do not compare Aurene to fucking jesus...  One is worth talking about the other is just a theorized zombie in a made up fairytale from an ancient bullshit book.
---
What is a book club? (c)
---
No. Only legendary raid armor has actual "legendary" skins.
---
Those that can be obtained from sPvP and WvW are just ascended skins with their item rarity upgraded to legendary to get the functionality benefits of legendary armor.
---
In WvW there are two different ascended sets for each weight class that can reach legendary rarity: the "Triumphant Hero's armor" and the "Mistforged Triumphant Hero's armor"
---
In sPvP there are three ascended sets that can be upgraded to legendary rarity: the "Ardent Glorious armor", the "Glorious Hero's armor" and the "Mistforged Glorious Hero's armor"
---
You can find everything you need to know on the wiki as well: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor

You mean how they are in [Tyrian Exchange Voucher](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyrian_Exchange_Voucher) which can be acquired with pay2avoidplay in lootboxes or through bauble bubbles?

Only 19 minutes? Hope he's feeling alright.
---
Honestly, Gorrik hit me more. Just that look of "I need to keep working, but... nothing's helping".
---
Well if you read the [buffed.de](https://buffed.de) article on this it says there looks to be Melandru statues in the map and the map will have a lot to do with Kralky so the question is where are the maps that have both Melandru statues and are tied to Kralky. I think its not a GW1 map but it has to be a human area so charr homelands is ripped away its been 250 years. I think its close to Orr and it may be the Scavenger's Causeway.
---
When her ears curled in it broke my heart. 
---
God I love Taimi, and I’m scared for her future just as much as the sanity of the commander after episode 5. Let my commander wrap her up and protect her, please and thank. She’s his little sister.
---
On buffed.be, they posted a lot of new photos, it appears to be extremely HoT-like
---
Felt like making a "quality armor" joke there... Fell flat.
---
They really need to paint a sign on that locked gate:
---

---
The spreadsheet is for those who farm it not for doing it normaly (aka max just some few), thus you dont need to wait for new ppl after each dungeon, and you dont need to know every singel path just the paths you will be speedrunning and if you dont belive me you can contact the guild or the guy.
---
It's inaccurate to claim that dungeons "need" better rewards. The rewards are better than they were during some of the pre-fractal history; they just aren't as good as they were at the peak (when arguably they were over-valuable).

I love my pred but outside of really dark areas you almost can't see any of the effects. Meanwhile pony bow which already had some of the most visually obvious effects of any gen1 got reworked lol.
---
Great find! The Melandru statue supports the idea that the new map will be close to Orr. The only map near Orr with rocky islands like the ones we've seen in the teaser footage is the map east of Siren's Landing.
---
[https://imgur.com/vQP0tdb](https://imgur.com/vQP0tdb) maybe the ultima keyblade? The final one you get
---
Necro is usually the "most hated" class in pve group content and ranger in wvw group content. However with necro it's more of a community issue than a balance issue (it's been pretty bad dps in years but since last few patches it's in a decent spot), where in wvw it's issue with both since ranger doesnt scale well with large groups (but works extremely well in small scale and unorganized fights). When it comes to pvp I'd just avoid ele because there's 0 reason to play it over any other class when it comes to efficiency.
---
In gw2 you need gold for everything and you get gold from everything, but once you have your gear ready (or have at least exotic gear which is ~10% worse than ascended gear, but much much cheaper and enough for 95% of the content) you'll mostly be spending gold on skins and QoL items. So it's kinda very important until it stops being very relevant.
---
Most popular gold farms in the past few years have been materials (open world maps usually) or fractal/raid drops (liquid gold, infusions or just ascended gear drops which let you skip the crafting part).

Yeah, where's the music that plays when I kill all of the other gods one by one with my bare hands just so that when I get to Grenth he knows to shut up and give me my baby back?
---
Kind of a lot of water tho. I hope they move it a little more land inward if it's indeed here.
---
So instead of an actual argument you're accusing me of being over-emotional. Typical sexist man...
---
and whats the reason from a players perspective? if theres no good reason from a consumer perspective, then why defend it?
---
Good point, that door has been there in Mount Maelstrom for years now hasn't it? This would be the perfect time to use it.
---
one day before mine
---
I was on a map with 6 commander. Not a single one was interested.
---
Probably means Ranger throwing will turn it into a shuriken as well.
---
there also have been oakheart essences visible both in the trailer and on the new screenshot
---
there might've been some druids there as well then ?
---
I dunno at first I thought it might be the area between Rata Sum and the Grove, but somewhere close to Mount Maelstrom would also make sense
---
Kral push the aurene buttom
---
Agreed, though there is a lot of water in the Skyscale trailer too ([time stamp = 17s](https://youtu.be/JQRFccP_DYg?t=17)).
---
What I wonder though, is why not release the name of the map if it is in Tyria (and your guess here is a very good shout for exactly where)?
---
I'm pretty much convinced we'll be spending a good chunk of time in the Mists, so maybe it's a case of Kralk heading south-east from Thunderhead, and where you speculate the map is could be where he opens a massive new rift as he tries to escape into the mists? 
---
As an aside, I do like that there's still a lot to speculate about with less then a week to go before the finale drops.
---

Too much water.

- IGN
---
You shouldn't have did that
---
That was great ahah
---
Maybe a part of this map will be in the Mists? I’m so hyped!
---
Oh I downloaded the wrong file 🤭
---
Thank you for your time!
---
That's been my general thought since the Skyscale teaser showing both Elonian and Maguuma asstes. Hopefully it's shifted to the east a bit more than the OP's map so that it can PHYSICALLY CONNECT ELONA AND CENTRAL TYRIA AT LONG LAST via zone portals.
---
You cannot, buying either expansion removes all F2P limits gamewide.
---
I must have missed it! Link pls
---
Send them another ticket.
---
They've altered the world map to remove water before (Ember Bay, Lake Doric, Bitterfrost Frontier, Siren's Landing, Sandswept Isles). Wouldn't be the first time we have strait or sea turn into a drained puddle.
---
Well hey, at least they didn't attach ruffles and high heels to make the girls look as stupid and out of place as possible this time.

I suppose I was too stung by the end of that zone to give it much credit. ~~"Oh hey, we know you warring dipshits caused damage to our Hometurtle, but let's split up and join each of your factions because that'll end well."~~

Cheers. Yeah, it's gonna be messy but the hope was it'll die down before the weekend.

Thank you for the laugh. I can picture the disappointment on the player's face, going through all the work to get the sword, using one ability, and watching as his sword runs away.

---
Thank you Anet for releasing this AFTER my final.
---
True. It really boils down to the faithfulness of the map art.
---
I hope not it would water down story telling. I am glad they killed Aurene and hopefully she will stay dead.
---
Oooh I took the flappy thing for the leg haha, confusing perspective on mobile thumbnails
---
I didn't know that! My GW2 lore knowledge is extremely sparse. Maybe he got bored of long books?
---
They used to do this all the time in Season 1 and Season 2 to an extent but it happened every 2 weeks so there were people who complained about the temporary nature. They would constantly change the world in permanent ways, new areas in zones, destruction of other areas, etc. Which lead to the creation of the story journal and permanent instanced story content that we have now.
---
Regent Valley was flown over by Kralkatoric when the Brand was made initially. Its that part where the brand turns west just north of Ebonhawk.
---
Cliffs of Dohjok and Fahranur both indirectly do since they were some of the first places we went when Kralkatoric started the brandstorms in Episode 1 of this season. 
---
D'Alessio Seaboard and Tangle Root have little-to-no involvement with Kralkatoric. Since the dragon can traverse the mists and pop out anywhere without a brand-scar on the map though, it is not too far fetched to think that maybe he would strike the place at which there are already tears and portals to the mists (Lion's Arch), especially since a lot of people just attacked him from there.
---
Ritualist roleplay.
---
Automatic punishment based on using slurs in it isn't - the OP isn't suggesting account action be taken for all reports, only those that involve hate speech.
---
Well, Kralkatorrik can pop up anywhere now. So really EVERYWHERE could do with Kralk now.
---
Better question would be: Does it use both jungle and desert art assets, and borders a sea?
---
I don't think any of them do.
---
Death.... Good.
---
Hence why I'm asking more than a simple "needs protecting childrennnnn".
---
Just ten heartbeats, brother.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I'm reasonably confident that there would be some water content, but far more sky content. Y'know, what with the personal dragoncopter and all
---
Sky content doesn't care about your petty terrestrial concerns
---
Joel during skyscale presentation hinted, that we will be taking it to the mists.
---
It means you are a disappointment to me and your mother.
---
The living world is the content that occurs between expansions, and continues the story of your character and the world.
---
The order of content goes
---
Core game-&gt;season 1 (non-playable now)-&gt;season 2-&gt;Heart of Thorns-&gt;season 3-&gt;Path of Fire-&gt;season 4 (finishing up next week)-&gt;season 5 (not released yet)
---
Within each season, there are a set of episodes, with seasons 3 and 4 having 6 each, and season 2 having 8. Each episode is sequential, so the story of each one is lead into by the previous episode, and together they tell the overarching story of each season.
---
What this means is that you can play any of the episodes from any of the seasons without owning other episodes, but you'll likely be confused in terms of story if you play the later ones first. 
---
In order to own the episodes though, you need to either 
---
1) be online during its initial release window, which is any time before the next episode comes out. So as long as you're online anytime between now and May 14th, which is when episode 6 comes out, you'll own episode 5
---
2) pay 200 gems per episode that you missed, or buy the whole season together for a 20% discount
---
In terms of story, you would want to play them in order. In terms of what you get out of the seasons though (new maps, new items, etc.), seasons 3 and 4 are more important than season 2
---
I said for guild wars not in general. This trailer DOES stand out among all the other ones they've released.
---
If only we had some sort of mechanic to like...grab a segment of the Mists and plop it down on the world map somewhere
---
Wouldn't that be nice
---
Bonus points if there's a branded Karka in it. Or, as I like to say and soon you will too -- a Kralka
---
That takes longer than what's mentioned in the OP.
---
&gt;Like most other convenience items, the Runecrafter will pay for itself in about 372 years.
---
So its a great investment for your great great great great great great great grand children?
---
Looking forward to it! I’ll be joining shortly after it starts. Should be a lot of fun!
---
The Istan does. Especially Western Istan like the Cliffs of Dohjok and Farhranur.
---
Thanks, I'll let the sax guy know :p
---
I was talking mad shit about how ugly this GS is. I take it back. WHAT DO I NEED COLLECT FELLAS??
---
They definitely like, signalled SOMETHING about Melandru with the Sun's Refuge content. Hey, I ain't mad, I've missed my grappling hook
---
Also a reference to a Churchill speech during WW2. "Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning." or something like that after a major victory.

It’s a very versatile quote.

---
&gt; Team ArenaNet’s participation in the [Mox Gauntlet for charity](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/arenanet-joins-the-mox-gauntlet-for-charity/ "Mox Gauntlet for charity") is ten days away! 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Now that you [know when War Eternal](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/watch-the-trailer-for-war-eternal/ "know when War Eternal") is coming, we thought we’d add a little Episode 6-related challenge to our fundraising for the charity. Right now, we have some fun giveaways planned for our fundraising milestones. The day of the event we’ll be doing a drawing for a Guild Wars 2 item:
---
&gt;* $1000: Quaggan mug with box signed by the ArenaNet Gauntlet team
---
&gt;* $2000: Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire vinyl soundtracks signed by the ArenaNet Gauntlet team
---
&gt;* $3000: Five Guild Wars 2 mouse mats signed by the ArenaNet Gauntlet team
---
&gt;* $4000: Guild Wars 2 Collector's Edition signed by the ArenaNet Gauntlet team
---
&gt;* $5000: Guild Wars Collector's Edition signed by the ArenaNet Gauntlet team
---
&gt;But we’ve talked amongst ourselves and decided to have a little fun over the next few days while we wait for War Eternal! As we reach donation milestones over the next five days, we’ll give you some hints on how to acquire your skyscale mount! Part of getting your new mount is searching the new map in Tyria for loose skyscale scales. For every $2,000 we raise for this year’s supported charity, we will share a screenshot of one of the scales in the new map to help you find it a little more quickly once War Eternal is live next Tuesday. (Up to six screenshots)
---
&gt;The charity that the Mox Gauntlet is supporting this year is [El Centro de la Raza](http://www.elcentrodelaraza.org "El Centro de la Raza"), and here is a breakdown of how your donations will be used:
---
&gt;* 25 USD: Summer Learning: Reduces summer loss of learning for one low-income middle school student through college readiness, tutoring, and leadership development activities
---
&gt;* 50 USD: Mentorship/Case Management: pays for one hour of time spent with at-risk youth who want to find their way on the path to academic and professional success
---
&gt;* 100 USD: After School Program: Provides one low-income middle school student comprehensive academic support and prosocial activities, including: tutoring, technology training, cultural enrichment, and case management for students as well as monthly parent workshops
---
&gt;* 150 USD: In-Home Family Education: empowers one child under the age of six to attain their developmental milestones through a series of 15 sessions containing in-home education and support
---
&gt;* 200 USD: Classroom Based Cultural Enrichment: Improves the academic, social, and emotional development of one at-risk high school student through art, including civil rights history and hip hop poetry classes
---
&gt;We’re going to get you started with one screenshot just for fun. This is the first one in the series–it doesn’t count toward the total of six, it’s a freebie! Once we get to our first $2,000, we’ll share the second one in the series. At $4,000, we’ll share the third one, and so on. [You can support Team ArenaNet with your donation here.](https://thegauntlet2019.causevox.com/team/ArenaNet "You can support Team ArenaNet with your donation here.") Ready, set, go!

Sorry, but Twitch is a private corporation, so it's their rules. If it finds a channel to be undesirable for whatever reason, then it is allowed to terminate it. That's all that there is to it. Feel free to start your own streaming service with your own rules if you want.

Here's to hoping!

Honestly I was expecting this place to be where Episode 3 took place. But back then, I was expecting ArenaNet to give Joko his properly due length of a direct plot since he was such a well enjoyed villain in GW1, and not the meager 1.5 episodes worth.
---
Back then I figured this spot would be Joko's "fake Staging Area" after losing the portals, colliding with the presence of Awakened during the prior Halloween that acted as scouts for a presumed march on Lion's Arch, only to find out that his real invasion (Episode 4) was to the east (bridging Desert Highlands and Fields of Ruin) with a plot to unleash the scarab plague on Ebonhawke and the charr to make his way into Tyria.
---
Then Long Live the Lich's invasion into Kourna would have been the finale for Season 4's first half/two-thirds with Joko's death at Gandara, leading into something along the lines of what we had for A Star to Guide Us (minus the Mists tomfoolery) and focusing on Kralkatorrik as we marched westward on the mountain. Yes, I figured they'd play it smart and make Season 4 to be 9 or 12 episodes long.
---
But instead they gave us what they gave us.
---
Fencing stops your hits from bouncing off under any circumstances. There are other ways to do that like Rathalos Mastery 4 (Does grand Minds Eye with some other stuff) in MH:World or by simply getiing the weapon sharp enough with Handicraft.
---
Looks like there's going to be quite a lot of verticality to match the Skyscales movement, it's a good way to make the most of a watery map
---
It's definitely in the top 2.
---
I would like to craft Exordium...eventually. I'm very casual, so it will take a loooong time, but do we know the recipe? I want to start farming the ingredients now, but I can't find anywhere.
---
&gt;are there updates that add new end game gear , and if the answer is yes, does it make sense to save gold in preparation for the next update or the next endgame gear / set ?
---
No, the devs don't do the whole "10 more levels or stronger armors" with each updates and I don't think there's any plan to do this, ever. Once you have the endgame gears, you're set for life. When they release new armor, it's just for aesthetic purposes.
---
&gt;I know that there have been 2 major updates/expansions "Heart of Thorns" and "Path of Fire". Are those type of expansions the only time we get new end game gear ?
---
See previous answer, no "new endgame gears" except for style. The game is basically "Fashion Wars", as many players call it :)
---
&gt;If you change your mind about your class, how easy it is to change it ? Is there a Subclasses system available ? Or maybe a quicker way to change your class other than starting a new character.
---
You get level 80 tokens with the expansions. Though it is advised to play a little bit of the character before using the token, so you can get used to it.
---
That's the look a professor sees on all of his students waiting in the hall when he shows up late on finals day.
---
&gt;For it may be that death is not the end,
---
&gt;But possibly the end of the beginning.
---
Awhile back someone had an absolutely horrendous speculation that we'll go to the mists and see Taimi there, and that's how we'll realize that she died to her disease while we were gone.
---
Given those lines from the trailer around death not being the end, I think something like this is actually pretty likely now.
---
I just want the style to be consistent for both genders.Want boob windows? give us pex windows too. They did wonderful job in post POF armour sets, but it seems like this set is heading backwards to the questionable vanilla sets again: where a same set of armour offers full coverage when worn by male, but somehow turns into a chainmail bikini when picked up by female.
---
Great... thank you anet for putting so much detail into legendary weapons. Too bad I made the longbow and got a big FUCK YOU after waiting for it since 2015. Really cool.
---
Maybe all the books are in braille
---
Even if it isn't something that happens overnight (automatic doesn't mean a human isn't reading them, or that action is carried out immediately), we shouldn't be seeing them for months after repeatedly reporting them. 
---
Even OP suggested the implementation of a strike method, so I don't think the idea of typos is relevant.
---
Based on previous legendaries, yes we do.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pharus
---
Anywhere you see "tribute to spero" or "shard of spero", it's actually going to be "tribute to _____ " and "shard of _____", depending on whatever they name it for Exordium. Everything else is probably going to be the same though
---
You might be in luck if all you don't like is the crystals. I've seen both a crystal version (trailer) and normal version (screenshots) of the light armor.  I'm guessing it's another armor with tiers.
---
Exactly what I have been thinking. The gods left the Mists, so those three could absorb the Elder Dragon's powers and live in the Mists as "dragon-gods". Since the rules governing the Mists are different than Tyria, they could probably absorb all the Edler Dragons' magic between the three of them.
---
Uh oh. She's intoxicated on Bobblehead Serum again.
---
Someone tell Taimi that she can't drink her grief away.
---
Kralkatorrik had little relevance to where he originally came from (northern Blood Homelands) since waking up though. Like Primordus, he's moved about.
---
The new mount will likely be locked behind a collection if the Beetle and the Warclaw are any reference so the sky content will be irrelevant at first.
---
I didn't realize I needed a Jora elite until now.
---
Yeah if they made the center of new LA less theme parky I think I would like it more.
---
Interesting. There is still a possibility the story will take us to other new maps, even if story only, but this does seem like a good candidate for the open world map. Personally, I was hoping it would be the Fields of Ruin to Desert Highlands map to wrap up the desert, but that is kinda wishful thinking.
---
Also, one other noteworthy thing about this area... If this is the new map, that means we would have flown over it, at least partly, when we entered the Crystal Desert. It would be kinda fitting to end right by where it began (just to the west of where we landed on that pyramid in Amnoon).
---
The change may have even come with the deployment of HoT itself and may have even been exlusively for weapons initially.
---
[This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Velocitas_Eradico) rifle came with HoT release I believe and features a folding/packing animation. I can't think of any model-animated weapons before that off of the top of my head.
---
Still nice to see them pushing the limits of their designs though, even if the tech isn't brand new.
---
Where are these pics coming from?
---
Aurene resurrection in some form is basically certain, but I'm expecting someone (more likely something) is going to use the mists for time travel rather than use the joko magic yet.
---
Slurs are not 'salty language' nor are they 'mean words'.  I never used the words threat or crime (slurs are a form of hate speech, which is not inherently either), so I'm not sure why you are, or why you decided hate speech has no definition. I will leave it below:
---
abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation. 
---
This is number one from the rules of conduct of Guild Wars 2, and is Anet's official position on the issue:
---
1. While playing *Guild Wars 2*, you must respect the rights of others and their rights to play and enjoy the Game. To this end, you may not defraud, harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress and/or unwanted attention to other players. ***This includes posting insulting, offensive, or abusive comments about players, repeatedly sending unwanted messages, reporting players maliciously, attacking a player based on race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc.*** **Hate speech is not tolerated.**

Does HoT ever go on sale? My girlfriend has PoF and wants HoT but Hot apparently is never on sale.

If she were to buy both the HoT and PoF pack would that get her two codes? I figure if she did that then at least the other could get used for login rewards, etc

also, this game is extremely alt friendly, in a way its more you account that unlocks stuff. and not your character. 99% of the thing in the game is account wide instead of character locked

I suppose there could also be more than one meaning or type, where human (I suppose all races but I’m thinking back to GW1) ascension and “dragon ascension” are separate things, or at least variations. I just assumed they were identical.

&gt; Lion's Arch is suppose to be used by the players
---
The same holds ture for all the cities.  I spend more time in Divinities or Rata than I do LA, as do lots of other people.
---
Everyone competitive is using the standard character model in those game modes.
---
i donno what to tell ya then pal. cause thats definitely a reaper skill that they're doing.
---
Maybe they used a posing sim that allows them to change the stance of the initial attack to make it look more dramatic. Notice the characters mouth is open too. Your character talks and move their mouths too but this seems more dramatic like it might have been altered.
---
The thing is, if that knowledge was important for other people rather than for Aurene, she likely could have told us instead instructing her daughter. She's a talkative enough ghost and has that adaptive AI in her lair. 
---
If it can only expressed between dragons, it's most likely that dragons are the ones using the knowledge.
---
I'm not denying that, I'm saying that it's definitely not the exact in-game animation that we have of it which I find unusual.
---
&gt; Will we get caithes branded outfit

right

I mean, it's not their fault you crafted it. There are several videos out there showing off the longbow.

&gt; Speaks for itself.
---
Not really.  "Hate speech" is vague, probably intentionally so.  There's a difference between "Stupid kittens.  That team is a bunch of kittens.  Our team is a bunch of kittens too, except me, I'm a kitten destroyer!" and "Fuck you, you fucking kitten.  I will kill you and all your kitten family in your sleep."  
---
I'd ignore and possibly block the first.  I'd definitely block and probably report the second.
---
Again, though, A.Net are not and cannot be the thought police.  Demanding a ban for naughty words and Wrong Think is an unreasonable expectation.
---
Lena Raine said that there was "something to look forward to" from her in regards to guild wars, so I'm very excited for her to make even more music for the game :D
---
I really hope we finally have a chance to end the Kralk storyline. We've had a very emotional story season with lots of losses and phyrric victories. I hope we can get a satisfying closure after all this.
---
He knew what he said.
---
How is that a scythe? U overinterpret mate, it's just like any other projectile.
---
It's a decent healer in fractals, speaking from personal experience.
---
Slight correction: You can use them in PoF instances, but not base or HoT ones.
---
This is what I tend to do with friends that I introduce to the game. 
---
I gave them all the option to choose, but in the end they all went with it because of story continuity and wanting to experience content with the tools available as it was designed to be.
---
&gt;  OP just wanted action taken against repeat offenders, and rightly so considering other players still have to interact with them
---
No, other players don't *have* to interact with them.  And with enough blocks, that player will end up in an MMO by himself.  That's the entire point of the block option is NOT to interact with toxic players.
---
&gt;  They didn't have to put it in the rules of conduct, but they did.
---
They did it to *allow* them to take action, not to *force* them to take action.
---
Meanwhile, you are responsible for your own experience.  Block or don't block, it's up to all of us to be mature players and handle adversity in a mature way.  
---
Reporting abusive behavior is reasonable.  Demanding action is not.
---
Flames with edgier flames! You are in for a treat.

Hmmm. Maybe we have been there already?

The Whisper's Secret weapons from the base game fold up.
---
While I'm all for invading hell to lay the smackdown on whoever's in charge, I think they've used that particular narrative device a bit too recently with our little romp in the Domain of the Lost during the main expansion story. I have my theories on how they're going to resolve that particular plot point, but the Ancient Greece Special isn't high on the list.
---
return to whatever hellhole you crawled out of. this is no place for evil spirits
---
Binding of Ipos stomps other gen 2 IMO.
---
Would be tight to make use of that arena in the charr city for a tournament that players could bet on and enter. Winner gets 10% of bets
---
I don't as it still plays on my client ;) I changed it back to HoT theme from PoF like a month after the release of the second expac.
---
Of course, thanks for pointing them out, I had a feeling there were examples in core but everything I thought of turned out to be effects.
---
^(Double Daggers)
---
i dont get why people care about this. the greatsword is the biggest weapon in the game. if you're going to go all out on the effects for a weapon it makes sense that it should be the biggest. GS also has a wide distribution, being available to 5/9 classes (though that'll only expand when new elites come out. I hope they add new effects for the new elites when the time comes.)
---
&gt;Complaint about unrealistic weapon designs in a game with magic and dragons
---
yeah, that Greatsword is alive.
---
Great choice, Maclaine always does some great dramatic and impactful pieces.
---
Wohoo, can't wait! She's probably my favourite composer for GW2 :D
---
wow, didn't realize that. Reached that long ago son i didn't realize. I ocassionally play both pvp and wvw. Definitely the level requirement for pvp is much easier to reach in comparison.
---
lol, a gimmick spec at best reliant on stacking of multiples of it to truly see benefit. It is individually one of the weakest condi specs in the game if it isn't bouncing epidemics. WTB revert of the ridiculous nerfs it received in PvE to it's F4 stacking shortly after PoF.
---
Nah man, the Commander didn't Perseus that bitch, they pulled the Odysseus Surprise and just kinda...walked out of the Underworld on our own. It's a totally different plotpoint -- and honestly, I reckon it makes it more likely. The Commander's BEEN to the Domain of the Lost, and come back. They're not going to just, NOT try to save their lizard daughter because it's too soon. Caithe's also nuts enough to give it a red hot go.
---
bet ya feel real dumb rn
---
Hmm, interesting concepts. I think I like what little we've seen of light armor so far. Also it looks like the bottom picture (I'm assuming that's light, the one with the new greatsword) shows what the "basic" form of the armor will be like, and the crystals and stuff get added in the upgraded version. Seems pretty solid.
---
I also think you're glossing over the landscapes here. The second picture, with the heavy armor, giant tree, burning ground, and glowing lights in the branches? That's definitely new!
---
I quite agree on the heavy, though I would like a good look at the basic version - if it's anything like the light or the elegy armors then there's probably some useful pieces
---
Update: looks like there is a bit more, looks pretty nice and I would get it except no way I’m wasting gold doubling up on legendary slots. &gt; Bolt and Flameseeker are my next in line.
---
And then another ranger tames it?
---
I wish they made more weapons viable in general so they would see more use. GS is probably the most used weapon in the game as for most if not all classes that can use GS will use it because its the best one.
---
I'd love to rebuilt the Eye of the North as a Guild Hall or as a story hub like Sun's Refuge.
---
Oh, who cares about the Joko magic? He's just a buff zombie. It's just the Underworld, ghosts get pooped out of there all the time. Hell, anything Joko could do would be as easily accomplished by a functional Resurrection Shrine. Easier, even. Aurene doesn't need her light snack from 3 episodes ago to get back to Tyria.
---
Gotta say though, Mists time travel? Bold call, and I agree in the long term. Might be a tad too kooky to show up on Tuesday though.
---
Says I need a character name?
---
It's a great spec with good support capabilities even in the most offensive setup and is fun to play.
---
lmao all I can think of is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5oL44gvdiU
---
Short term prices are dropping due to the event, and at the end or after the event prices will go back up. The actual supply barely changes at all, and the demand is unlikely to decrease, but at least for a time there's an extra opportunity. 
---
If you're the type to do Choya Pinata on a regular basis, then this event fits you. For the rest, it's a novelty breaking up the monotony of their typical play patterns, but it quickly becomes monotonous again and the rewards aren't enough for more than a temporary boost in interest.
---
#This event's infusion drop rate is not the cause of that...I can tell you that. There's a reason for that, and it's psychological, not economical.
---
Longbow 4?
---
Waiting a few weeks has paid off (25€ to be exact).
---
Does anyone know how long this sale will last? Bacause I may not be able to buy it within the next two days.
---
Episode 4 release was a shit fest. Episode 5 was pretty smooth except for some players getting stuck in terrain and dcing after Kralkatorriks close up attack. It's a gamble.
---
Oh, I don't doubt that they'd give it a go, but beyond the fine details "come back to life by breaking out of the Underworld" and "bring someone else back to life by breaking *into* the Underworld then breaking them *out*" are basically the same narrative device, with the most notable difference being that the latter tends to work a lot less often. Also, from a gameplay perspective having one of the last major events before the climax be what amounts to a rehash of an earlier instance isn't exactly the best way to get people in the mood, unless you're doing a Greatest Hits boss rush or something (and I doubt the Eater of Souls was anyone's favorite part of PoF). There are ways they could pull it off, of course, and if that's where the story ends up taking us I'll still enjoy it, but I'm not sure it would be worth the effort.
---
I'd like to amend this request, and ask Steve Blum to record the following line in the deepest Rytlock voice:

Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

---
The reason it's broken is that it takes 3 people to kill 1 Scrapper. That, and they also have good pressure for how stupidly tanky it is.
---
That's kind of sad to hear that they simply told you hey go buy another one. That's really bad customer service. They don't need to offer you any compensation or gifts or anything but what they should have done to provide good customer service is apologize for the inconvenience since clearly they didn't have the game include a qol feature like unlocking the achievement automatically. They should be welcoming the suggestion and thanking people for taking the time to try and help improve the game even if their main intent was to hopefully get the item back/restored or give the achievement. It still brings up a potential area of improvement for them and its pretty sad they couldn't see the opportunity. Sure they can still suggest that you buy a new one since said idea is currently not a feature and they are only now aware of this. 
---
You should post the actual conversation you had as we are assuming your description of the conversation is full and true.
---
Great news, can't wait to see all the effects. But there is one thing that worries me...
---
is everything alright with the lady in the picture? I mean, look at her legs...
---
The core mechanic of GW2 combat is dodging. PvE and PvP are largely both structured this way--dodge, or any hit will kill. You can't dodge condis, so either you have good cleanse and are willing to chip through the condi tank, or you lose.
---
A side cape on the 1st pic for females only. :/

No it wasnt because i still dont have an eggsac infusion! /s

[I mean they got close in GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/f/ff/Kralkatorrik_map.jpg)
---
She has a degenerative disease already.
---
Guard and Mesmer focus is meta I think in PvE. In competitive modes Weaver uses Focus too afaik. 
---
Binding of Ipos does not have an obvious necro theme IMO, its more like sorcerer or warlock. Both Mesmer and Ele can fit that category as well, and if you make a nice themed armor Guard can too.
---
Also dps Tempest that has one of the best bursts in game. They are quite good in cm and t4 fractals.
---
HMMMM on one hand I want to make this and style my Mesmer to match it.
---
On the other I want to save my gold because the cash shop will probably come out with some really cool skins that I can buy for a fraction of the price and enjoy those, cause if I make this sword then end up not using the skin I'll be pretty annoyed with myself. I already stopped using my legendary pistol, dagger and rifle skins.
---
True. I didn't like it before, and I still don't like it.
---
Be sure to downvote me, haters, simply for having a difference of opinion ;-)
---
Er... that is exactly what they did.
---
Both events are written precisely in the Meta description. They even went to such length as to have different descriptions for the different states of the events and even when one is done and not the other.
---
But since it wouldn't obvious enough to some players, being in the general area does put the events in your minimap while they happen.
---
&gt; Expecting all players to individually ban a volatile individual is unreasonable.
---
No, it isn't.  It is enabling them to be the curators of their own experiences.  It puts the tools into the hands of the people that allow them to make their own choices.  
---
I was going to be a bit disparaging and compare the insistence that A.Net *do something* to make the bad people go away as being a child/parent relationship, but it's not even that.  
---
We teach children to have problem solving and conflict resolution in their own play with classmates on the playground.  And when someone is using ugly language, you walk away and do something else.  We only need to get teachers or parents involved when there's an actual threat.

Is this a preview? This must be a preview, you are not fooling me, WP.

Endgame groups don't check your build, they mostly check dps / hps and boonuptime.
---
If your build lacks any of that in your specific role you'll have a hard time.

I want to see Anet create the Scythe as a new weapon type. It makes sense in GW2, and the Necro/Reaper would be the most appropriate class for it.
---
And a huge Greataxe for the warrior.
---
What effort?  All anyone ever does at any of the core tyria meta bosses is press 1 for loot.
---
What shardblade art are you looking at? Can't find anything where this GS would be close in design,let alone the closest one.

---
I run a lot of spb in pvp and indeed don't have a lot of trouble with the average scrapper. Now really good scrappers make you waste so much time that engaging them in 1 v 1 is often not advised. And even if you strip their stuff they are quite resilient.

She is "kneeling" in mid air. The thing pointing to the ground is piece of armor.

I'll be honest, I couldn't give the slightest shit about raids and always downvote them.

I got a feeling we're going to FoW, as aurene has part of Balthazars magic her spirit may have landed there to take part of the Eternal Army. Kralk might be there too to consume it. the Eternal Forgemaster will be crafting our new armour...maybe itll be called Obsidian armor.. crazy theory but it kinda makes sense to me

Thanks for being involved with such a great game. We appreciate you guys and gals more than you know.
---
For getting legendary armor, it basically goes like this:
---
Raids: Highest skill requirement, lowest time commitment.
---
PvP: Medium skill requirement, medium time commitment.
---
WvW: Lowest skill requirement, longest time commitment.
---
While not necessarily at a disadvantage some of them are annoying not to have once you've gotten used to the quality of life.  Stuff like downed skill 5 is especially powerful on condition classes for example, (LS3?)
---
It's kind of bullshit how much extra attention it gets, I agree.
---
Not just bad for new players. We have the variety of builds now but its going too far now. Not to mention the fact that the different between each classes now is very vague.. you don't have that distinct play style player different classes.  I seriously they disable some older traits at least in pvp and it will make the game way more competitive.
---
Engies aren't allowed to have fun.
---
Your title is...really really bad. I can kinda tell who read the actual post and who only read the title.
---
Anyways, given that we’ve got a whole other season ahead of us, no, I don’t think storywise the game is ending soon at all. And who knows, this upcoming episode might not even be the end of Kralkatorrik’s arc (lowkey I kinda hope it is because I want to get out of the desert and if I never have to see another brand crystal for a century it’d be too soon 🤪). Zafirah also says in the trailer that this is “the end of the beginning.”
---
We’ll have to see what this episode entails, and see what Season 5 is like.
---
But all that said, I don’t think Anet is planning to bring the story to an end any time soon. MAYBE at best they’ll bring Kralkatorrik’s arc to a close with this episode but there’s so muchnwe can do after that’s been dealt with. The world is a huge place, and there’s still gaps in our current map (looking at you, Dominion of Winds) as it is.
---
Guy, it's a legendary weapon. There's gonna be an arm glow and footfall +/- a body aura effect. While it's cool how the blade itself morphs for different attack types, it's a pretty safe bet there's gonna be footfalls and an arm effect.
---
That sky color is giving me some Zhaitan Orr vibes.
---
Actually you won't be able to play some maps or reach certain placed on the maps, if you don't have the masteries. Counts for both HoT and PoF. 
---
For example you won't be able to play the last part of Dragon Stand without the gilde and updraft mastery. You won't be able to visit certain places in PoF without Jackal's sand portal mastery or the higher jump mastery for your springer.
---
fuck, i got it a couple days ago

---
Umm are you stupid? So things with real world value (cards) are less gambling than valueless pixels? Wow, you make the perfect case for why lootboxes are differnt from gambling and still get the wrong conclusion.
---
Same here, final exams next week and the week after.
---
45 minute breakdown on the choice of camera angle of the first frame of the trailer ensues.
---
yeah the fuckin "the end of the beginning" shit is really stupid. I'm sure the episode will be better though.
---
It seems like a weird change indeed yeah. Though the skill now potentially grants almost double the life force, its damage potential is entirely removed. With that there doesn't appear to be any direct damage oriented offhands on necro, they are all sustain or condi oriented.
---
Can you unlock the “exotic” pre-skin from Glorious Armor reward track or is it only available from the skin-tab at the vendor?
---
Thanks
---
TBF, there was a door in Straits of Devastation that could have led to Siren's Landing but didn't.
---
The thing is, Greatsword was the gw2 replacement for gw1 scythe. As in it filled the roll of a big cleaving weapon. So whilst it's something I also want to be added, I know we will likely only be getting scythe skins.
---
Don't make fun of her ever growing brain tumor. It's fatal.
---
It shouldn't be permanent, but it should happen more frequently for wvw events. Even if it's not new content, more events like double exp and/or no down state should happen monthly or on reset night or re-links just to help things get off to a rolling start.

---
Mystic for a little better results than copper
---
because, like the griffon, my guess it will be a huge gold sink and not just given to the player via story.
---
If you mean salvaging Rare gear to get ecto, then Mystic is a good choice.  If you mean salvaging ecto to get luck/dust, then copper is good enough unless you have lots of mystic stones in your bank.
---
Unless I'm running full zerk sic em + unblockable Sbeast which is risky if you yourself get focused or can rely on someone else who is good dps to burst them down then I honestly don't bother... sooo many times I've unloaded full burst with sic em only for them to land like 10% hp left auto proc elixir or miraculously dodge the last bit of the burst and full heal up so it's like... yeah forget that.
---
You absolutely need to coordinate a burst on them or hope that the scrapper is noob and doesn't know when to utilise hammer blocks/dodges.
---
There is that theory of what might have happened when Aurene devoured Joko. With Kralk absorbing and appropriating the magic of Zhaitan, Mordremoth, and Balthazar who wasn't a dragon to begin with, it's safe to assume that Elder Dragons and their scions can absorb and adapt any known kind of magic.
---
Aurene can feasibly have absorbed Joko's undeath magic.
---
I hated the old LA. The rickety repurposed-shipwreck hovels with blury textures and low poly. No sense of direction, no planning, no visual appeal - just dirty planks and even dirtier dull gray rock. It won't even work with mounts, the layout is too convoluted with little open space.   
---
I hope they don't take away the new LA as the main hub.
---
Dormammu, I have come to bargain.
---
HOT made me quit for a few years. I’d go straight to POF and not just get the Raptor, I’d unlock canyon jumping and also get High Vault/Jump on the Springer. It will dramatically improve your quality of life.
---
what armor is that (or is it new stuff)
---
It was fun but perhaps I perceived it that way because of the double exp buff? I’m definitely supportive if anet wants to make such events more often, but I wouldn’t want no downed state to be a permanent addition.
---
I won't rest until Ele gets a Shaman spec. With axes, thank you very much! (would kinda fit the lore if the next expansion pulled towards blood legion homelands)
---
63.25% chance of at least one ecto. Mean number of ectos per salvage with mystic/master salvage is 0.875.
---
Tbh i thought it would release on the 28th, but I knew people that were more of optimist than I.
---
Druid, renegade, or firebrand are your common high utility healer classes. Druid can bring spirits, spotter, and might, renegade can bring alacrity and assassin's presence, and firebrand can bring quickness and some more defensive support.
---
Tempest is a super strong healer but it doesn't always bring quite as good of utility, and scourge is a strong off healer (barrier) with condi cleanse, but not much offensive support
---
I was wondering about the second option to get luck and sell dust. But I don't have much mystic stones so probably is better copper if there is not much difference.
---
The expected value (mean) number of ectos upon salvaging a rare is 0.875 ectos.
---
The value of selling a rare is 0.85 times the listed price due to TP fees. 
---
The cost of one salvage of a mystic salvage kit as 10.496 copper (assuming free mystic forge stones).
---
This means that if we let selling price of a rare be p, and the price of ecto be e (both in copper),
---
0.85 p - 10.496 &gt; 0.875 e  
---
p &gt; 0.875 / 0.85 e + 10.496 / 0.85
---
p &gt; 35/34 e + 12.35 copper
---
The 12.35 copper is pretty negligible, so price has to be greater than roughly 35/34, or 103%, of the price of an ecto.
---
