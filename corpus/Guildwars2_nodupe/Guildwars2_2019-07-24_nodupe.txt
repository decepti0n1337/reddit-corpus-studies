Or perhaps "whatever, I do what I want." If someone asks me to do/not do something in game, I'm typically happy to oblige. Seeing someone giving out orders in map chat makes me significantly less likely to play along

Facts and figures
---
have you tried getting the joke before commenting something as stupid like that?
---
Destiny 2.
---
Yep which is why their monetisation model is insufficient.
---
I have good fps and I know exactly what to expect with that ability and I STILL get smoked because I just literally cannot see the ground effects through all the crowd and noise going on up in melee
---
For your whole talk of the vertical design being just “chasing ilevels”, I feel there’s a whole lot more to do in ff14 than in gw2 and their activities are more fun too and has nothing to do with maxing out my ilevel.
---
Rather have a offseason 2v2 season than tournies.
---
Oh entirely, I'm not trying to make an argument here about whether it's reasonable or not, I'm just here to explain why some people are feeling so negatively
---
what is wrong with your brain that this is the leap you make?
---
What is it that you think has changed that they're not telling you about?
---
You know what game also likes to use "stop playing and come back later" schtick? Diablo 3.
---
No, it isn't, but I'm not surprised that you are so stuck on the negativity that you see it that way. I get tired of games and "go away" all the time, only to come back and enjoy them that much more because I'm not stuck on the negatives.
---
One thing I loved about GW1 was that I can actually play it mostly solo, so I can really come back and pick it up later as long as the servers are up. 
---

---
Gw2 not so much.
---
"We're working on the same thing we were working on last month and the month before."
---
The veteran players who are quitting the game are well known for throwing money at the game. /s
---
cool got some examples?
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
&gt; Balance patches are coming pretty quickly now
---
Quarterly? Thats not quickly.
---
Oh those. I've heard of those. So fact-y and figure-y.
---
They should give Chrono IP back and make the Shatters behave differently rather than just "Original Shatter + something new"
---
Split Second can be changed to Shatter clones, dealing half the initial Mind Wrack damage first, then the remaining Mind Wrack damage after a second, with more damage dealt in the second burst if target is slowed.
---
Rewinder is kinda fine.
---
Time Sink can be changed to create a short lasting slow zone which dazes enemies inside it, creating at each Clone location.
---
Is CS is gonna be the new Distortion, then give it invul back during the split.
---
Players can end the split early to jump to this current timeline and not teleport back to where their split started.
---
Mostly PvE, story, raids, fractals, open world. 
---
PvP from time to time, mostly only for a season. 
---
WvW only if I need a Gift of the battle. 
---
I know about the complaints about WvW, but since I don't play it much, I can't say anything about it. I also know about the complaints about new fractal and raid releases, but I guess but I think I'm not affected that much because I play "everything" (aside from WvW). When I play PvP I just take a nice build and have fun, I personally don't have problems there (aside from salty people), but I understand that PvP only player could want more.
---
What is 'tribation' mode?
---
I solved it by just listening to music while spending an hour doing my chrono boon opener on the practice golem.
---
Sword 3 -&gt; Time Warp -&gt; F4 during cast -&gt; Shield 5 -&gt; Well of Recall -&gt; SoI
---
I did it about 200 times or so while listening to an album. Once I felt like my muscle memory was successfully reset, I tested my subconscious by trying to sing along to the songs accurately - which occupied most of my attention - while continuing the rotation.
---
Once I could successfully sing full songs with the correct lyrics and correct pitches, while still nailing my opener, I knew that the new F4 keybind was cemented in my brain.
---
Legendary Flock Rune
---
Congratulations, I'm so happy for you! What do you think you're going to work on next? GW2 is all about setting long term goals!
---
It just sounded like you were implying that in order for anything to change we have to get a response. Apologies if I misunderstood.
---
This is why I always say
---
IF you don't know what you're doing, don't go out of your way to blindly ignore every form a communication

I remember how things were, I was there from launch too, I just didn't remember people whining about the wardrobe idea before it came out.

Is there a way to do the thief sword 2 without flipping the skill over to return?  I just want to use it to keep on a target.

How about communicating with the playerbase, telling that shit is going to happen and what the playerbase wants most

but, and you really hear me out on this one

dont give any date of release.

quick reminder:
---
Q: When will GW2 be released?
---
Sure
---
he actually gave me his business card and wanted me to mail him the idea. I wrote a very detailed mail how it could work but what the downsides also would be. He thanked me for the detailed mail but we never got rich presence :(
---
We all lean over and inspect David’s card and Price quietly says, “That’s *really* nice.”
---
A brief spasm of jealousy courses through me when I notice the elegance of the color and the classy type. I clench my fist as Van Patten says, smugly, “Eggshell with Romalian type...” He turns to me. “What do you think?”

“Nice,” I croak, but manage to nod, as the busboy brings four fresh Bellinis.

---
[This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame) is probably the best list of stuff to do. The best approach is to decide what you want to work on and then dive into that. Dungeons are kind of hit or miss. Fractals are pretty populated and [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) is a good guide for those. Raids you'll probably want to put off for a bit longer until you're more comfortable with everything. There really is too much to digest at once, so it would be better to just pick an aspect and go from there. Is there anything you've been really considering learning?
---
It's not the end but you can see it from here
---
Why is is to hard to accept that GW2 is past its prime? No game lives forever. Eventually GW2 will end too. It's not about being negative or hating the game (I love it) but everything eventually ends.
---
Discord is great if you have multiple communities you're a part of. If you're dedicated to a single community or group of people then TS3 is probably far better suited. Though that said, my group of friends that religiously use TS3, *also* have a Discord *AND* Slack chat. Nothing makes sense.
---
What's the second best map for farming ascended trinkets? I do the usual winterberry farm but that only gets me the 3/6 trinkets. I tried Windsewpt Isles but that's just so damn slow that it doesn't feel worth it. Are any of the other maps any better?
---
I appreciate the effort involved in taking this picture.
---
Same goes for hardcore players that tell casuals to go play open world or minecraft in raids, spvp and wvw. If someone is toxic then no matter they are casual or hardcore.
---
88 in material storage. i call bs!
---
Dude, newest content came out just over two months ago.  How fucking fast do you guys want content updates?
---
so that is why some cooldowns were not being reset half the time. i had noticed the jankiness but had not identified how it worked completely. thanks for the info
---
...we have their financial data for total revenue. It's steady.
---
sorry i'm a casual player idk what material storage is. Is that a raid reward?
---
&gt; Honestly if you were in Anet's shoes, would you really support PvP or WvW actively?
---
As 2 of the pillars of the game as originally envisioned by anet absolutely. Their problem is they don't want to examine why players of those modes get so salty.
---
I've always found chrono to be more survivable in the open world than mirage. I just play it better. Sometimes it's about what you're comfortable playing rather than what's "better". I know quite a few people who play power chrono in the open world, I can think of probably five off hand, not including me.
---
we definitely don't need more "look, 69.6969 gold! lololol" posts either. but hey, you can hate if it makes you feel better
---
this is good
---
There's a reason why rules are intentionally broad.
---
My point is, I don't think I could have played ANY other MMO for 10k hours and I've played this one for much more than that.  If people are saying I've done everything in the game and I have nothing to do after 10k hours, I'd say they've gotten their money's worth, and this kind of this game I've not played has a lot to do, may or may not be an illusion because you haven't played that game for 10k hours. The grass is always greener.
---
&gt; What the fuck is "truly hardcore" even supposed to mean? Difficult? Complexity? Tediousness? Grindyness?
---
All of the fucking above. How hard is that to comprehend? How you got anything different from that is completely beyond me. Telling me I agree with the other guy posting is completely ludicrous and not the case at all. Wow!
---
When was the last episode.
---
What I think is going to happen now will be that in 2 weeks, people will start wondering why there has not been an announcement while the dumpsterfire here on reddit burns out slowly. 
---
There will then be a post that the next living world release might take longer than usual (the cadence has slowed down anyway so the word "usual" is already somewhat comical) because of the layoffs and how they want to do it right.
---
At some point, probably in a time-span lf 5~ish months, it will release with a new map, changing locations fully.
---
The content they have worked "so hard" on will be played through in a handful of hours.
---
There will be a reddit AMA about the release where the questions and answers are jerking eachother off while the more controversial stuff will be buried.
---
To be fair, I do not know why I wrote this, but fantasyzing about this is actually amusing. This is just a piece of my mind and probaböy, most likely, not how it will pan out btw.
---
It's an attempted meme originating from Teapot's girlfriend Mata (supposedly; I've yet to catch up on some of the later streams where it caught wind, but it was mentioned in a prior stream after Teapot announced his intention to check out FFXIV once the ERP tournament had concluded) which spread among some of Teapot's snarkier viewers and which appears to now have landed here on Reddit. Basically FURNACE TAKEN and its shorter variant FACT NUKE are anagrams for a certain phrase showing dissatisfaction towards ArenaNet/ANet (whose name appears in the anagram) for the lack of content, the state of the raids etc. in GW2 as of this writing. Basically it's Mata (and other related meaningful repeatable challenging content enthusiasts) voicing out their frustrations although thankfully I haven't spotted Mata herself post the phrase on this Reddit yet.
---
I look forward to watching the two most recent Teapot streams to learn more about the context and the rapid spread of the phrase and what Teapot thinks of things spreading beyond his community, but I'm somewhat disappointed at some of the members of Teapot's community (although I wouldn't be surprised if some unrelated folks are involved too at this stage) spamming that anagram here when Teapot--as the fine, understanding and well-spoken lad that he is, so kudos to him for that--had explicitly asked his viewers not to cause an uproar and to keep things PMA at least until the ERP tournament has concluded.
---
Hope this help shed some light on this phenomenon. :)
---
this  
---
I would greatly embrace the idea of paid subscription if it meant the game gets proper updates with proper frequency.
---
The end game is farm, AP, dungeon, raid, fractal and legendaries only. So...?
---
As a veteran player, my main issue is that most of the new shit is in THE GEM STORE! Oh a new cool skins is coming? Guess where it's gonna be!
---
Oh a new cool thingy is coming? GUESS WHERE YOU CAN GET IT!
---
It just ruins any reason to care about new conent.
---
First immortality. Then the bitches.
---
No thanks.
---
You're right, you do overestimate your ability to decide what's healthiest for GW2, Anet, and this community, you pompous jackass.
---
Do you consider two weeks difference  blind fandboy?
---
When your goal was to minimize criticism , yes.
---
See I don't get comments like these. The last episode released just over 2 months ago. We've had longer waits than this over the course of the last few *years*, except many of those waits didn't even have nearly as many festivals and events as we're getting now.
---
So because we've been waiting for just over 2 months while getting events and festivals as opposed to *nothing*, the game feels like it's on maintenance mode?
---
Man, it's dire when you put it that way
---
Thanks, this is helpful; I'm not into watching streams much so this drew a complete blank for me. Not anymore though thanks to your explainer.
---
Thank you for explaining it!
---
I was hoping they’d space out the festivals a bit more, just when I thought I’m finally free from doing an extra set of dailies everyday now this festival is coming :/
---
Yeah I know I’m not obligated to do them, so I just might not. Dragon bash was a different story though, it was my first Dragon Bash and the skins looked cool.
---
We want communication, we are clueless at what we are getting
---
I understand what you're trying to say but you should really look back at what they did to warrant the negative response first. This isn't simply just ppl getting pissed off cause their favorite class got nerfed. Without writing paragraphs on the history of wvw a good tldr example is if you look at how when they teased an upcoming wvw update that is not alliance, people were all saying anything would be good as long as it's not mounts. And what do they end up with. Not to mention how they handled the announcement. 
---
You can't blame the community when you've been consistently ignored both in terms of updates and on forums for years and every time they come along with an update is to add something you didn't ask for that didn't improve the game mode and was either just a gold sink or made it worse. The only positive addition I can think of recently is the reward track.
---
Ah thank you so so much! I really want to hit more dungeons, for sure! I also just started exploring PoT, so I'm trying to understand everything that's going on there. But it's mostly dungeons and world events that I'm trying to dive into. I'd like to take a swipe at fractals eventually, but I'm still not certain what they are.
---
Ugh
---
I agree, they should have line of blight.
---
You're not comparing apples to apples.
---
At every point in the game's history since living world began, we knew there was either:
---
1) More living world (and roughly what form it would take).
---
2) An expansion.
---
Right now, there's no expansion. And LWS5 has an unknown structure, except for the "roadmap" blog post which only suggested that they're changing the scope of episodes to meet a quality bar. And the only concrete thing Mike Z said in it was that they're not committing to a new map with every release.
---
He had previously said that season 5 will have "expansion-like features", but that was before the layoffs so even if that was honest, I don't think it's valid any more. The concerns about the game being in maintenance mode are very warranted with how thin communication is. The only thing ArenaNet has communicated on since War Eternal was gem store items and recycled seasonal events.
---
I know the theory, but you have to kill the champ quickly before she runs out of traps, which is a bit harder when you're alone
---
These posts are the ones that make me hate this sub, just baseless shittalking
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/
---
They don't need to give you a week by week status update.  This post was more than most companies give.  Just wait a bit for the next stuff to come out.
---
Remember the content droughts before HoT?
---
Honestly in my opinion, and I know I am going to get flack for it:questing systems are pretty lame. I lose interest in almost any game that uses them
---
No offense, but why do you care? If you don’t like it take something away or move along. People are allowed to be angry about the state of the game and spread their thoughts. This Reddit’s isn’t just about praising Anet and taking low resolution photos of your achievements.
---
Business 101 also mentions there are customers that you can't AFFORD TO KEEP.  They want everything.  They demand much more than others.  (Insert white elephant joke here or one about high-maintenance girlfriend)
---
They are playing their business their way ... why such a hew and cry ?!  You act like you bought stock.  Gems are not stock, they owe you nothing.
---
There is (sadly) no branded beetle. I would buy it so fast to complete my collection.
---
Because I'm wondering why this sub is filled with the same post by 50 different people.
---
This is so on point, it might as well be the point.
---
&gt; Timegating everything - whoever made that decision should be timegated from designing games permanently.
---
Doesn't every MMO do this? Isn't this, like, a key aspect to padding out how long players run raid content for whey they can only get 1x set of loot per boss kill per week? Or how you rank up reputations/factions and whatnot? The last set of raids I did in WotLK even had time gated unlocks to continue part of a raid instance to just slow down the pacing for world firsts or something.
---
You mean like “Episode 6 coming in May” “new legendary accessory” “new raid coming out in a week” “new festival coming to hoelbrak” “summer festival returns next week” “season 5 coming soon”
---
&gt;and then you get 6-12 months of head-pats and gentle re-assurances until you find out support was pulled / canned. 
---
Part of the reason why ppl are on edge is that we dmhavent really recieved such pats and re assurances about the future of the game. Unless, as you mentioned you play exclusively for the short term of lw. 
---
After w7 in a devstream devs siad supposedly that this was the closing raid of pif and have not been mention of a new wing being in the works. After w6 and that release's AMA  we k ow about w7 being in the works (and even before w6 came out). Fractals its a similar bag, with the loss of fractals ben (aka best ben) the communication about fractal development is all but gone.
---
But, by far the most important thing, what pretty much everyone is looking forward to, the expansions are also in an unknown status, compaired to pof which we knew was in the works for like a year before it was even officially announced.
---
Different perspectives, similar rage. No different than people posting 50 pages about how the new plush is “sooo cute”
---
Bored now.
---
This is a long time coming tbh, I've felt that way about the game since a short time after PoF, and now after the end of LS4 and knowing there is no expansion but another LS to look forward to, well now is the time to express that opinion.
---
But generally, if people want to comment on a new plush or whatever, there'd be one post with 50 comments.
---
Can't people find a "review GW2" thread, and leave their review in it like a normal person?
---
Anet is kinda infamous for going for extreme opposites. Colin vs MO communication, HoT vs PoF content difficulty and replayability. Heck, even vertical vs horizontal maps. That's justified by the mount addition, still funny how they explicitly try to go for a direct opposite for some reason. And both extremes end up biting them in the ass, as the practice shows.
---
Yeah, no.  Leave for a year while season 5 is being released, and now you have to pay $30 to catch up on the story.  Miss enough releases, or if you're new, and you'll have to not only pay ~$40 for both expacs, but another 2400 in gems for seasons 3 and 4, which is another $30 (2400 gems, $15 a season).  The longer you're away, the more things you miss and the more real money you'll eventually have to pay.
---
That is the current meme right now
---
Because of saltiness (like this forum), Anet vowed to stop communicating .. period.  NICE JOB.
---
I've worked in software development aswell and we both know that Arenanet have a lot of features that are certainly not going to get scrapped, they've already been pushed through the majority of the pipeline. They never talk about any of this.
---
Telling me that their Guild Chats talk about interesting things is a massive fucking joke lol. Give me a single stream in the last year where they told us exactly how they made a cool new system. They used to do this years ago, I remember watching various devs at games conventions talking about how they created their server architectures - that's interesting stuff of substance. Not how many fucking pairs of shoes the head of marketing has (over 120 btw).
---
The vast majority of the time whenever they talk about anything, it's the story team, the marketing team or voice actors.
---
Fractals are not that accessible. You **have** to invest in ascended armor and especially infusions which are nothing but an annoyance and serve no purpose other than being a gold sink.
---
Raids being rewarding? The time it takes to learn a bosses or hell, even to kill the boss, is better spent in silverwastes. You get 2 gold coins for killing Dhuum. TWO. GOLD. And a shitty exotic rampager chest piece. Once per week. CM gives extra rewards once in your life time while you can farm fractal cms everyday. Thex even nerfed raid rewards by turning champ bags into unidentified gear. Selling the peerless infusion once every two months or so is a small bonus. It is only rewarding if you have a group to blast through all the wings in like 4 hours and then login back next week but it takes a long until you are able to do this. Meanwhile silverwastes can be done by anyone with lvl 68 green gear while watching Netflix.
---
Current hot topic, which I'm guilty of feeding into
---
Its an off period in terms of content, and its been 2 months since the last episode 
---
There isn't an expansion ahead of us in the next patch - its a complete mystery to us all right now, there r promises of fixing/balancing + adding new content to old maps by Anet, and everyone is riled up by what that can mean, we all have suggestions, hence the trend
---
It's been pretty true since launch, tho. Game has almost always had a problem with getting new content, ever since launch. "theres no sub so it's ok" was the mantra back then. 
---
I'm not any happier about it than you, but you should've came to terms with it ~4 years ago.
---
In the last 3 years, people have become VERY addicted to 'loot farming' in any form.  They run the same loop for days.  THEN ...  complain the game is boring.  Kinda silly.
---
I've played the game for many years with many long breaks, it just cant hold me for more than a week or two at a time :(
---
They won't get any visibility if they do that, it gets all fucked having everything condensed into the same thread. It's a lot easier for you to just ignore posts you don't want to read.
---
I couldn't make it to the expansions because of how boring the combat is, and combat is a huge driver for me to keep playing a game.
---
We are not clueless... Maybe you are but then you should read the news (that aren't new anymore). 
---
LS5 will come as intended, no big delay, no "season pass" or anything people speculated because they didn't read the informations. 
---
Anet gave us all informations between ep 5 and 6 of LS4. They said everything we need to know (and more) and those informations are still the case. 
---
Do you really need to get a reminder every few weeks to feel informed?
---
That's because PVP is trash and dead in FFxiv
---
One of my issues with gw2 dev's, "me: hmm I found a great build, it's not broken and I'm not exploiting, just has great synergy, wow, I'm having so much fun with it" [a.net](https://a.net) comes in and nerfs it to oblivion !!! fort no good reason other than some minority fking idiot complaining about his PVE progression vs my PVE progression !!!
---
anet: you can play however you like, proceeds to add daily and weekly lockouts to every goddamn thing worth doing, because dwayna forbid someone can progress faster than some care bear with little to no time time to play.
---
I myself don't have a lot of time to play anymore, but I hate it when I do put together a nice chunk of time to do some gaming and I'm hit with some mfking goddamn daily / weekly lockout !!! all because anet listens to some goddamn care bear moron that has no idea what a mmorpg is all about !!!
---
Gets me so damn mad /rant over.
---
I dont understand the downvotes, have ppl stopped doing t4s and w1-7?
---
i just usually target them and start caps locking in his/her face, that usually works.
---
&gt; It's a lot easier for you to just ignore posts you don't want to read.
---
Thats...The entire point of reddit...?
---
You know what? I'll give it another go. Is the Samurai class any good?
---
It's like life, you don't have to go to the bar EVERY night.  Take some 'me' time and a break from the grind.  Above all, don't chase 'carrots'.  Guide yourself to worthy goals.
---
Piggy-backing off this idea, why haven't they expanded the EXISTING mount packages? I've only ever bought the branded mounts, love the look. They recently had a skyscale package with the branded skin, but I'm not paying $25 for one skin I'd use. But I'd pay another 1600 gems to have my branded beetle/warclaw/skyscale in a heartbeat! I'm sure there are plenty others in the same boats with the Wintersday mounts/Mad Kings.
---
Not really, the engine isn't something that can be easily ported to consoles without remaking the whole game from the ground up (which would prompt the PC version getting an entire remaster as well) and while there's a lot less buttons than conventional MMOs, its not like FFXIV where a lot of the keybinds can be foregone in favor of simply using the menu (not to mention the UI isn't as customizable in GW2 as it is other MMOs). FFXIV has its PC/PS4 crossplay as they were developed simultaneously for the most part, so KB+M and Controller configurations are solidly made.
---
Well that's kinda the point isn't it - why can't we hear about the ideas and directions before they are set in stone so that we, as a community, can try and drive the game where we want it
---
Branded Dredge can see, i think. I remember blinding them with Guardian GS #3.
---
The difficulty curve of GW2 leaves a lot to be desired these days.  There's basically zero modern instanced PvE until Fractals like Nightmare, Twilight Oasis, &amp; Siren's Reef.  Dungeons are really bad at teaching core combat mechanics.  I've gone into dungeons with newer players that don't have good dodging habits and they almost always die in dungeon skips unless someone tells them to bring swiftness, stability or stun-breaks.  They get chain CC'd, die and get left behind.  They feel embarrassed, worthless and they tend to leave pretty regularly whether they're frustrated or ragequit or whatever.
---
&gt; If people want to get mad at ANet at something, it should be at ANet's 
---
&gt; absolute radio silence of upcoming updates.
---
Salt from the vocal few triggered Anet to never again hype upcoming features. (this was announced shortly after the previous director left)
---
&gt; What's going on with "Wing 7 is the PoF raid"? When Season 5 isn't part of PoF, are we getting raids at all in Season 5?
---
Don't mix stuff. Raids are *not* bound to LS. They are bound to expansions. Wing 7 IS a PoF raid, no matter if LS5 will be bound to PoF or not. 
---
&gt; Exactly how big are the WvW/PvP/Raid/Fractal teams now?
---
&gt; What's going on with current events? Give us some hints at where the story is actually headed.
---
&gt; Give us some teasers for the new gameplay systems coming in the first episode of Season 5. 
---
So all you want is nothing else but leaks... yeah, no that won't happen.
---
Oh look, this argument again.....

The ones that made it to 84 days had multiple holidays wedged in those windows (Christmas/New Years, Memorial Day/4th of July)
---
The casuals downvote anything raid related cos reasons
---
&gt; GW2 has never been a game that's exclusively been for casuals or hardcore players.  **It aspired to be a game for** ***everyone*** 
---
My memory might be a bit fuzzy here, but since it was first announced and during development, I was always under the impression that they went for a far more casual-friendly approach, or at at least I feel it came across that way. No raids, no gear treadmill, etc, and a lot of focus on achievements, exploration, events, story, and dressing up. I think that the GW2 model, love it or hate it, is pretty much what it said on the box.
---
I think it's great that they later added challenging content for the more hardcore players, but I find it rather odd when they say that they feel neglected because it's not the main focus of the game. I raided for years in WoW and have always been into competitive multiplayer games, and I never felt that I could get my fix for both those things in GW2 in any serious way. 
---
I have a few friends that were absolutely convinced that there would eventually be this massive competitive PVE and PVP scene, since the game looked and felt absolutely great and really deserved it, but they eventually realized that it wasn't part of the plan and learned to enjoy the game for what it was. Perhaps some people are trying to get something out of the game that it was never realistically going to deliver.
---
Then explain the phases the sub goes through from time to time with everyone posting legendary weapons, map completion and character styles. Bonus points if you took a picture of your screen with your flip phone.
---
You can't be that daft to say that they give anything interesting to the general playerbase. Last time I checked a mere handful of people watch their recent Guild Chats - barely reaching 500 viewers lol, more people would rather watch Teapot criticize the game for 5 hours a day. Like it or not, you are the minority here in being happy with their communication during their half-assed, boring, heavily moderated and clinical streams.
---
&gt; And LWS5 has an unknown structure
---
Ah.. and did you know the structure of LS2 before release? And LS3 and 4? Nope. The only thing we knew is that the release time went from every 2 weeks to every 2-3 months with the start of LS3. Nothing else. 
---
There is nothing unknown, no unknown structure. It will be a new LS season just like LS3 and 4 were. Plus improvements.
---
I'm sure people have posted dumb shit before, just like they are doing now. 
---
Two people with extra chromosomes don't become one person with normal chromosomes.
---
3 of them are real content, probably you didn't play during the wait for HoT to launch. It was zero content between the reveal and the launch
---
Oh wowie! Imagine a PR &amp; Marketing team in a company with over 200 employees with dozens of thousands of customers! Shocking!
---
Skyscale best mount.
---
He calls everything that's not "anti Anet" a Fanboy. He stand out several time with those comments and posts. 
---
Maybe a personal issue, who know. I wouldn't take him seriously.
---
This subreddit just doesn’t like content that doesn’t have to do with PvP, WvW and Raids... Honestly, I’ve been pleased with the content so far, and I can definitely wait until Season 5 is out. 
---
The awkwardness of ANet’s silence is kinda painful, but I wouldn’t want them to completely spoil what they have in store, either.. Sometimes I just think this fanbase can never be happy because they feel like they’ve already been hurt enough. (Though, those opinions are valid, too.)
---
Nov 13 wasn't a balance patch, so that makes it 58 average, essentially 2 months, which is still too long.
---
Didn't they already cater to the hardcore crowd with raids? Oh right, raids aren't good enough I guess.
---
People expected GW2 to be different because Anet said they'd be different. When we had the summer of festivals in S1, people complained because it was the same shit every LS update, and then Anet said that they'd be buffers later and that they'd be easier to iterate on. Then the next Halloween update did exactly that, and the bar for festival sequels got raised way higher.
---
I just want to say that I really appreciate that you come here to say this.
---
In times like this, where the game feels empty and people talk about leaving, seeing a dev talking about active development, even if just hinting and without any schedule or timeline, is a welcome sight.
---
So..
---
Thanks!
---
For whatever reason I haven't felt like LS4 was particularly enjoyable.  It just felt like it dragged on and on until it reached a conclusion and we fought Kralkatorrik.  I'm really just kind of worn out and tired of the Elder Dragon Campaign Chronicle. 
---
I think ArenaNet is good at listening to the community; LS3 was very exploration focused and LS4 was very meta-focused.  ArenaNet seems to have a really difficult time balancing living world seasons between these 2 styles of content and it sucks.   
---
I don't think that GW2 is dying, but I think, as you said, a lot of people are reaching the end of the line.  I'm certainly feeling that way.  I understand that reddit isn't fully representative of the in-game community and disproportionately represents veterans, but I take some solace in that people are expressing their frustration here and not in the game itself; letting people play w/o reservations.  Socially, I think GW2 over-values independence and it makes it difficult to form anything more than casual friendships with people because chances are you're never going to interact with them again.  I think there's something just a little tragic and off 'bout that. 
---
I don't really feel like GW2 is an MMO that encourages people to play together.  Don't get me wrong, meta-events provide mutual goals for players to work towards, but they're very linear, on-the-rails scenarios that don't really seem to play to the game's strengths.  I think my favorite amongst GW2's strengths is that mobility and platforming are really fun here.  I liked the concept of the Crimson Marionette a lot because it valued individual and small-group awareness of mechanics.  These days I feel like we're all just sort of running around screaming things to death with incoherent death by a thousand cuts &amp; bruises.
---
We just need that WvW rework... The sooner the better
---
As a pve main, WvW really really needs some love. I've dabbled and it's in bad shape
---
Last time feels like so little time... Probably because the one before that one was a buttload of time.
---
Minecraft.
---
&gt; Is there just one clue to shows that GW2 isn't dying ?
---
- Last LS episode is only 2 months ago
---
- next episode will come in the next month or so
---
- new festival
---
- new special events
---
- next festival soon
---
- LS5 will come as intended -&gt; content for the next 1-2 years
---
- they announced tons of stuff they will and want to bring into the game
---
- the whole uproar is 1.) only because of one streamer and his fanbase; and 2.) only on reddit. Take off reddit and it's fine as it always was. 
---
Enough, or want more?
---
&gt; I mean for me Season 4 showed a full disappointing ending 
---
Ep6 was a full success and is the most popular episode. For sure it's a matter of taste, but most people don't think like you here.
---
&gt; and no links with the future of the game.
---
Yeah... that's what people call a "completed arc". A big arc is completed and now we start another one. Which should be pretty obvious since LS5 were announced long before LS4 ended...
---
&gt; The same event again and again
---
That's the point of annual festivals?...
---
And if you talk about the worldboss rush, Anet said, that they want to do it again and improve their rewards. And they did.
---
&gt; Veterans leave the games.
---
Ohhh and this never happened before, right? 
---
Players come and go, veterans are no exception. And if you talk about streamers or "popular" guilds, they are not worth more than others. 
---
&gt; And it is so visible that it is the end 
---
Enlighten us, why is it "so visible"? People say stuff like this since release and nobody were right yet. So please tell us what's different now? Or is your only reason that LS5 starts a new arc?
---
I assume you mean black lion exclusives since the vast majority are available on the trade post.
---
I was expecting reddit post Mad Libs :(
---
&gt;you're just describing minigame stuff, not actual gameplay stuff :V
---
Uh....what...
---
For the rest, yeah it's just different tastes. About combat though ,FF 14 definitely improved. Actually I quit the first expansion because of how dry the combat felt. But now, in this newest expansion so far, the combat's been amazing. There's a reason why we see more and more posts popping up on the sub about GW2 players migrating to FF14. Personally I found GW2 combat to be droll, I greatly prefered GW1.
---
There aren't any more tank and spank fights in the dungeons/trials/raids ofc. They're all pretty intense. I speak as a ranged DPS main.
---
&gt;Oh I'm sorry, is my opinion "Low value" to you?
---
Yes.
---
I think it's because normally all 6 together are discounted, and since you own 5 of the 6, it takes off the rest of them, essentially discounting all of the remaining episodes (one).
---
Hear hear!
---
This is really incoherent.  It's kind of a chore to read, sorry.
---
And a lot of that fired staff was working on projects other than GW2; other side projects.
---
So basically gathering tool skins
---
Ah true. So you are more into sandbox games then, not story driven theme park.
---
I completely agree, actually. I'd be content with this sort of stuff ***if*** we had any sort of communication from ANet about where the game is headed (more than a LS5 is coming, guys!!1!). 
---
Memes aside, the frustration comes from not being sure of where the game currently stands or what to expect in the future, coupled with the fact that ANet just seems... not to care? 
---
We're getting new gem store items constantly, repeats of pre-existing content, no clarification re: questions the community's asking frequently (Is W7 the last PoF raid? When is GvG coming? What should we expect in LS5? etc.), and one of the biggest community events (organized by an official partner) is getting zero love from ANet, which is doing absolutely nothing to help morale. 
---
I'm legitimately sad about the state of the game and I mourn in memes.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
The last content patch, before Dragon Bash, was just over two months ago.  I don't think they've ever had that fast of a turn-around between living world episodes.  When they do announce episodes I think they normally start talking details within two weeks of the release.  My guess is they're not ready with Season 5, Episode 1... so why the fuck would they tell you anything yet?
---
They could write an in-game reddit client.  Make it a pub.
---
Even with that it still does great things. I've left most of the other big Mmos on the market time and time again and come back to gw2 for the polish, the combat, and the "go at your own pace" gameplay.
---
Its a shame if it were to go under, nobody is challenging the genre anymore.
---
That’s because there’s no “meta” for open world. Most of the people looking in the open world section of metabattle are very casual players who want a cool build that can take them through story/ow content, and holo is just way better at that than scrapper. Scrapper is totally fine in open world, but holo does it better and in a more understandable way, people prefer big aoe burst damage to a weird boon bruiser. Play what you want but in general just play the recommend holo build with scrapper instead of holo and hammer instead of sword.
---
Dude...I didn’t realize it until reading this. TS3 feels like it was ages ago. It really hasn’t been that long since Discord took over.
---
the fallout happened on reddit...even though what JP did was abominable, we did not look so hot either. I would legitimately not put my employees through that
---
Youre immediate concern is thinking "how do you know they wont come back" but not "why are they leaving"  having a game  that essentially revolves around playing for a few hours once every 3-4 months makes it so the people that play the game continuously are essentially punished for doing so. Forming any real communities become pointless, there is almost no content that actually encourages to even requires groups to form, So during those 3-4 months youre off in another game with those things why would you come back to gw2 for a company that cant even manage 1/4 of that. If you as a player play a game for 3-5 hours once every 3-4 months then you basically are gone.
---
I suppose reddit wants that Mike Z comes out every week and tells them, yes, LS5 is coming!!!
---
Pretty sure that's the point cause it's satire.
---
Get on the damn flowers already!  I ain't rezzing you!
---
uh, you've no idea what no communication looks like, buddy
---
I'm saying that as a WvWer and I've played games that were dead
---
Every game has people leaving all the time. New games come out, people leave. Balance changes happen and people leave. You act like this is something that never happens in any MMO much less an almost 7 year old MMO. Surprise, people move around all the time in this genre. Some leave and come back and some don't. Big FF XIV expansion comes out, people get hyped. Some people will never come back and some will, and this is absolutely business as usual.  WoW lost a ton of people recently, and BDO lost a ton of people before that. Changes cause people to move. New products cause people to move.  Content draughts, which we're not having causes people to move. It's normal for a 7 year old MMO period.  
---
Do you know how many times my sons have stopped playing WoW?
---
This is the point I was making.
---
Thank you for basically proving it.
---
Our interactions are just as important to the health of a game than the support of tue developer. You can't just dismiss the social aspect of a MMO when you're writing a comment on the third party forum which the devs have no control over.
---
Gw2 is dying, among all the other PC mmorpgs
---
If I made a game, I wouldn't require them to read chat in order to understand what's going, even if it was mmo. So far I havent struggled with events of such sort
---
Majority of people posting such memes and doom posts are not even usual gw2 redditors or they simply made new accounts. Don't feed the trolls.
---
Yes
---
When did I ever call for an alternative to dungeons/raids? I mean, shit, why not just do what it is and compare crafting/gathering to what it is in GW2. It's more involved in FFXIV and that's about it — it's just a means to an end and not the core loop of gameplay.
---
Or rather: It's not that they're *too different* so much as they just aren't things I would do actively for fun. I'd only engage with those systems if I have to in order to pursue a goal through them.
---
When you said
---
&gt;For your whole talk of the vertical design being just “chasing ilevels”, I feel there’s a whole lot more to do in ff14 than in gw2 and their activities are more fun too and has nothing to do with maxing out my ilevel.
---
I thought you meant there were more active things you could do within the core gameplay loop. In GW2 I have incentives to engage regularly with Fractals for raw gold + progression towards things like Fractal God, grind out some dungeons for rune sets / cosmetic/dungeoneer unlocks, run map meta events for Amalgams (or events in general for map currencies / karma / collections). I even have a reason to dip my toe into pvp/wvw when I feel like it, and it's never for the sake of catching up to the highest item level. It uses the same core gameplay loop of combat across all of these options and they all feed back into a core account value you can do with as you please. 
---
A game with vertical progression / ilvls ultimately feels like you *have* to grind up gear to do the new content and then once you have the current highest set you then wait for the next jump to pick those up too. If I remember correctly, FFXIV had things like daily quests right? Or am I just thinking about WoW? Stuff where you're given a goal to work towards and engage in that core loop.
---
If you think it's enough to just log in, gather some nodes, craft some items, and gamble then have fun with it. I don't think that would be enough to satisfy me for an MMO, though.
---
I think that's just good posture bro, not rigidity.
---
Me failing to spell. :(
---
It doesn't, yet it's one of the loudest places when something happens and over the past 6 years that I am part of GW2 and it's larger community I have seen changes that were implemented not because of the forum or content creators but because of Reddit.
---
Most notably was the confusion damage change around the time of HoT which can be felt to this day in PvP yet any mention about that change gets dismissed by this part of the community due to 'we needed it' and it wasn't until a year into PoF that they rework conditions and confusions in a way that doesn't inherently breaks PvP as a whole.
---
You get them all if you use a booster.
---
&gt;Memes aside, the frustration comes from not being sure of where the game currently stands or what to expect in the future, coupled with the fact that ANet just seems... not to care?  
---
I'd say the dissatisfaction is actually with the status quo.  
---
We know what to expect, another season of the living world. What this means based on previous releases, is 6 new open world maps and story episodes with low replayability, 3 new fractals, and 2-3 new raids, over the span of 18 months.  
---
The past 2 years haven't cut it for many players, and another 1.5 years of this is devastating for them.    
---
And like you say, ANet hasn't shown any indication they care. There has been loads of discussion about the substance of content since LWS3. And an overwhelming criticism of PoF was its replayability and rewards.  
---
What was their response? "We'll increase rewards a bit I guess" and otherwise silence. Then they move onto S4 which features *the exact same problems*.  
---
Moving into S5 they say "Developers will have more flexibility", but does that actually mean anything when they haven't shown any acknowledgement of the issues? I'm not reassured in the slightest.
---
Chrono is dying, Guild wars 2 is not, unless these chrono timebend guild wars 2 into the dark alternate timeline
---
I think what people really want is just an updated game engine, with new expansion content... possibly a new class and or race.  Basically reassurance the game isn't going to be put into maintenance mode anytime soon.
---
Multiplayer games generally have an expectation of communication though. Particularly with things that require a coordinated effort.
---
You have more motivation and dedication than 7/10 members of my raid group put together, and I'm proud of you.
---
Thats because Anet cant make engaging endgame content anymore bc the typical gw2 needs both hands to click their endurance bar. Thank you for verifying how they recycle festival instead of creating new content for players. I dont know how you consider one wing a year a "drought" its basically dead. WvW is a mess and they refuse to do anything for that game mode other than make mount skins. SPvP is essentially in the same boat but yes but yes lets recucle meaningless festivals instead of updating our core game modes. Tell me again how long ago was that sad excuse of a roadmap again and when was the last time they did anything close to an update on it. Explain to me why it takes 7 years to create a build template when a small group of fans created their own with 1/100 of the resources and time Anet has at their disposal. Why bother updating core game modes like raids, fractals, spvp wvw when you can throw out a mount and keep people distracted with mount and gem skins that have more development put into them than your core game.
---
Actually every MMO recycles festivals, because why make new content every year for three weeks, but Dragon Bash this year was completely 100% new. New content even if you don't like it.
---
And you're right, if 80% of the playerbase isn't good enough to raid, it's STILL more important to appease them than you. Seems we're in agreement.
---
Oh, survivable, absolutely. And naturally it's a question of personal taste. What does it with Mirage for me is its ridiculous mobility. Playing Chrono feels like running around with a turtle. Plus, of course, Mirage Cloak. Being able to evade without interrupting what I'm doing right now is something I became dependend on. Sure, I do less damage, but you don't need much damage to reach "enough" damage for open world. As a bonus I'm now as nimble and uncatchable and fast as a Thief.
---
How is this cat's face never not funny?
---
Uhm, pretty sure they didn’t announce an expansion until the finale of S2. I remember plenty of people having this exact same debate back then.
---
It's Frejdaslaves. What did you expect from them?
---
Never going to happen. Sigh.
---
Did Anet ever revert anything?
---
Yea , just take a look at warframe.
---
Best communication management out there.
---
This is what I expected when they announced their intentions
---
Ehhh, yes and no. I don’t think ANet is trying to justify gem store items as content in the same way a new map is content, but it sure does put a bad taste in my mouth that they keep rolling that stuff out like crazy while the state of the game is what it is.
---
How very strange to have more than a group feeling with literal NPCs than standing in a crowd of 50 people bashing a loot pinata. What?
---
"the life finds a way"
---
If the fck chrono people will find an alternative, people are just too used to depend in a class as the "core for everything"
---
Maybe this is the content that finally gets me to reinstall! *clicks* ...sigh
---
She came later and should have never been allowed near social media due to her history. I remember people saying (particularly over at kia) that she was going to explode and get fired over something dumb on social media when she was hired, because that's exactly why she was looking for a job at the time.
---
Personally I think the game is definitely declining.  I am also of the opinion that it would be entirely possible to turn things around.  
---
In order to do turn things around, you’d need to deliver something more than Season 5.  Ideally you’d want something that overhauls the core gameplay mechanics and reboots the story.  
---
I think one of the main things ANET needs to overhauls the reward system.  GW2 has big problems when it comes to tangible rewards.  99% of the items in the GW2 loot tables are essentially vendor trash or trash tier crafting materials.  I’ve been playing SWTOR recently is refreshing to actually get “good rewards” for playing the game.  It doesn’t matter if I’m doing single player or multiplayer, I’m guaranteed to get “good rewards” in the process.
---
They stopped doing reddit AMAs after JP drama
---
Something too complex for your brain to process
---
I wish, but I don't think that it is..
---
You're right, they reworked sigils and runes to make them more balanced. I forgot that balance patches only count if it's classes that are being balanced.
---
Happy to help
---
Unpopular opinion (judging by quickly skimming through the comments here) but I’m looking forward to it, even if the post doesn’t do much to inspire any excitement.
---
I first started in 2016 because a friend of mine got me into it. And I didn’t stay with the game for more than a few days back then because I was too busy with life and the other games I had far more invested in. 
---
Fast forward to almost a year ago, I decide to give GW2 another try. And this festival came out shortly after I “returned” (though really I was experiencing a lot of stuff for the first time). But I was too busy leveling and just learning my way through this game to partake in the actual festival, so I never got to appreciate it.
---
So, I for one look forward to the chance to actually do stuff in the festival this time around. I wish others did as well, but understand why you’re not too thrilled with it (after all, you’ve probably done everything you wanted to in the festival multiple times over), because I’ve been there with other games myself.
---
Agreed. 
---
Step 1. Announce what you intend to do. 
---
Step 2. ~Do that thing.~
---
Step 2b. ~Ok, there were problems with doing that thing, so just sweep it under the rug and go silent for six months.~
---
Step 2c. NO, don't do that! Be honest with the players, explain, in broad terms at least, why the plan wasn't going to work (in some cases, the players might have an idea to fix it!), and what you intend to do instead.
---
Step 3. Do that new thing, or repeat 2c as necessary.
---
33,000? Sounds like the freemasons and their fetish for the number 33. Either that or the New World Order likes pastries.
---
PANIC
---
Was it that long time ago?
---
Main problem is you need skimmer for a portion and switching to beetle mid run sucks because of starting at zero stamina
---
&gt; The same fanboys who whined about the idea of a PvE wardrobe, because it would be bad for the gem store
---
What the fuck? Lmao. This is the most absurd thing I've ever heard.
---
I just save up map completion keys until they add something I really want, then I pray to RNGesus.
---
Honestly as low effort as it is, I like old content being revived or more encouraged to do. I know a lot of people run world boss events, but other then the occasional Tequatl or Triple Trouble I don’t really. People were actually back in the old Orr maps running events for the meta event rush, which was super nostalgic and I loved it. Wish they would do something similar for dungeons.
---
For now..
---
There are much better options for condi like Slb or Scourge or Renegade.
---
Mirage brings absolutely nothing to the table in PvE groups besides its condi which even Renegade outweighs and provides Alacrity on top of it.
---
If I had to choose to have a condi in my group, mirage wouldn't be it.
---
Unless of course, you're talking about PvP: then we can come to the conclusion that CI Mirage is pretty much the best option. For now.
---
Contact support: there is nothing that can be done here.
---
This is why I can never bring myself to come back for more than a few days at a time every couple of months.
---
All this cool shit I want is just "farm gold to buy X shiny on the gemstore." No cosmetic or reward means anything and even then. Most of the big fancy cosmetics ernable in game are gated behind pure gold or 10-20% farm a specfic content for a reward...but then pay an extrodinary amount of gold.
---
No matter if you want in game or gemstore rewards the overwhelming majority of cool things you earn in this game are "Farm the most profitable farm for X hours to get it." Don't enjoy the mindless profitable farms? Feel free to do what ever you enjoy while earning a small pittance because the economy and prices are suited to that massive gold gain.
---
yeah same. every group im part if has both, ts and discord. which im really happy about. well except one. and hearing every background noise from everyone is really annoying
---
It’s a lack of communication and also living world being really unsubstantial in terms of content that they deliver. Living world is... it’s alright—for filler content. But for it to be the only content that the game gets is *very* disheartening.
---
A future expansion, what season 5 looks like, new raids/fractals, updates to PvP/WvW, anything? Who knows if we’ll get any of those? We don’t know, and ANet not communicating their plans makes the situation a lot worse...
---
Mostly because the clear % of raids is really low relative to population size.
---
I'm actually somewhat surprised anet spends the development resources on raids, considering the amount of people who do them.
---
&gt; Dungeons are really bad at teaching core combat mechanics.
---
It doesn't help that people these days are so obsessed with skipping everything possible.  AC and Arah are the worst offenders I've seen.  Hell, in AC it's a free for all at the end getting through that hallway so you can get credit for completion.
---
If I have a power DPS class that doesn't have any significant effects that occur on critical hits, then should I still focus on crit capping or should I go full berserker's? I'm not sure how to calculate the precision needed for optimal damage since different skills hit for varying amounts of damage.
---
I'm try-harding on [this power mirage build that I brewed for open world trash mobs](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAsdRnsICdqhloBGqBMMjlUDzPB+AngkDgSQAo8DcC6GA-jxBDABQp8LO9NNq+DBPpgvUCCwpUwo9HCAcAcezb+5Z+5nf+zP/8zP/8a+5nf+5nf+5nfeZA0HDA-e). The only relevant trait in this discussion is [Sharper Images](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sharper_Images), which I'm not so sure is worth considering in a power build.
---
The reason that I'm asking about this is because I want to adapt it for a Qadim kiting build… for the memes. Since one lava elemental spawns every three seconds, I need to be able to kill each one within three seconds (including the time that [Mirage Thrust](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage_Thrust)ing from the previous one takes). I don't want to rely on leaving my clones to finish the job because I need to trigger [Superior Sigil of Stamina](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Stamina) to be able to use Mirage Thrust for mobility.
---
I've been doing some minor testing in the Special Forces Training Area, but since I can't reenact the kiting scenario there, determining exactly how much damage I can do in exactly 3.00s is proving to be difficult.
---
If people are moving to FFXIV for raiding they're going to the wrong place.
---
You think GW2 raids are sparse? FFXIV is 4 fights, that you can clear on week 1 with a good group, every 8-9 months.
---
IMHO character bound on equip is fine, since it can create incentive to earn something on multiple characters... But character bind on acquire is dumb. I should be able to transfer it up until I equip it at least.
---
As someone who was once new building that habit of paying attention to chat in grp scenarios has been key to my sanity. Also key to my insanity when dealing with players who never read the chat at any point and you just want to kick from the group because they are not responding in any way to any message in any chat group or even whipsers....
---
So you go into lfg join a group and still have all your chat disabled? were you scared by bad experiences in the past?
---
The thing I don't get is that Anet or at least NCsoft  definitely has a PR person or probably a whole team. Why do these communication professionals think it's good to communicate so little?
---
Holy shit, those glassdoor reviews.
---
Well, Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games are supposed to be focused on group content. Guild Wars 2 tries to make so you can do it both ways, and likely does it better than any other mmo out there when it comes to soloable content. What more could you ask for without asking them to hurt the game for those that play it as a MMO instead of a singleplayer game?
---
Using the the lvl 80 Boost is like leveling up, the only thing you don´t get are the item rewards, character and account unlocks on the other hand will be unlocked.
---
While I agree that they are plenty of leeches that fight fucking kills my computer. I don’t often die to his kill move, but when I do it’s usually because of frame drops or lag spikes.
---
I don't know but there's a know your meme [page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/woman-yelling-at-a-cat) about it if you wanna know.
---
Yea, I was hand kiting
---
Maybe. Of course, PvE in this game is harder to create content for. The quest hub system in other games is far easier to create content for. These zones are generally more complex than zones in other game, and the ways to get around them more creative, which is what keeps some people in the game. 7 PvE mounts with different skill sets keeps things interesting. It might not interest you but if it interests the bulk of the playerbase...if there aren't even raiders then something does have to be done.   I was very vocally against raids at the beginning on the official forums, because I said that it's not going to be enough. There was never going to be enough raiding content to keep the hardcore community busy enough to compete with games that center on raids..and there are plenty of those. That's an area Anet really can't compete on. Not with WoW and not with FF XIV. Those are games that made raiding the de facto PvE end game.   This game has something most other games don't have, which is one of the best open worlds I've ever played in...so that's what they focus on.
---
It sucks for raiders, I agree. If Anet hadn't introduced them in the first place, we wouldn't be here right now.
---
you got banned for using lfg for something it's not intended for
---
Last time I checked condi mirage is still close to BiS for Matthias, Cairn, Soulless and Twins.
---
I on the other hand see it like this:
---
GW2 is too focused on micro transactions and making cash for korean overlords than making a game for players thats why they dont have new content when they dont need to. they are too focused on making numbers work on a spreadsheet than a game work for players.
---
Or to put is simply, if there was no hungry NCsoft with a whip, GW2 would be a much better game.
---
GW1 was, and there are many many examples where people make great games when they dont have profits as their main target.
---
sadly this is ncsoft/ea age we live in and thats really sad for all of us...
---
&gt; Did Arenanet fuck up hard or something?
---
Not really, no. They actually did a very great job in the last few months, contentwise. 
---
However, it started with that streamer who said that he leaves GW2 and go to FF14. Earlier he became conspicuous for raging against GW2, but in this case he said to not freak out, afaik. Anyways, his fans did and started this whole "doom GW2" drama. 
---
Problems from the past like "content drough", "no roadmap", "no communication" and so one became popular topics/arguments to complain about the current "crisis". As well as acting like refugees to meme the Bless online incident.
---
However, this whole drama fortunately is mostly limited to reddit only. Maybe some people will talk about it ingame, but I didn't see anything yet. 
---
All in all, there is no exodus at all. A streamer say he leaves, maybe his guild and some of his fans will leave, nothing noticable for the game.
---
Totally agree. Its the group settings like dungeons, fractals etc where people not reading or responding to chat gets insane sometimes. If everything is going well great no real need to check out chat, once the group starts struggling and chat is still being ignored its starts getting less and less reasonable as time goes on. It is after all a MMO so there is a reasonable expectation for there to be communication with the other players in your party. Getting radio silence is frustrating and you cant know if there is a legit reason (some kind of parental controls or perhaps a language barrier) or they are ignoring chat in hopes that everyone else will some how power thru and they can get carried while putting in the worst effort possible.

u/imhere2downvote better get the images from that page, the quality is better :)
---
From what I understand is that Anet intends to develop the game their way as they see customer feedback to be useless noise until the content is released and once there's no game breaking stuff, they'll jump to the next project. So if there's not enough people complaining or too many people complementing a certain content within a time frame after release, they'll close themselves off from touching it. Personally, as a returning player, it sucks. Trying to catch up to 4-5 years of missed content and you cannot leave any feedback because it'll just be ignored. Fuck it. I give up. I give up on this game and I give up on Anet. I'd rather jump ship to a fresher mmo that is more to my liking. Even if they announce Guild Wars 3, I won't touch it because Anet lost my trust. It's too bad because the community is what's keeping this game going. Anyways, that's my 2 cents on this, have fun with this game while I couldn't.
---
AMA were transferred to the forums *before* whole situation happened: [ArenaNet Forum Chats starting on 15th of March](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8149gs/arenanet_forum_chats_starting_on_15th_of_march/), while P. [attacked](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1014554296107483136) Derior on July 4th and Mike O'Brien released the statement on 9th, after her and Fries were gone already.
---
If anything, they wanted a more controlled environment for steering the discussions in their favor but in the end, we're having the chitchats about "devs favorite x" in the game instead of plans for future or specific features. I do understand they didn't wanted to participate in threads on reddit which were filled with all sorts of questions - mostly the difficult ones but also the posts that were totally unrelated to the discussions. What I don't get is why they believe that people will want to participate in discussions on forums where writing rules are very strict and you can't openly criticize state of the game, it's features and content but instead it's expected that you only pour the sugarcoating, which in their eyes seems to be the game promotion. 
---
Sure, *the JP thing* did affected the way they are talking to us but they can't hide behind forums happy rainbow safe space forever and pretend that community is satisfied 24h/day, 365 days a year. Despite of what happened, social media still exist and still are the key element in product promotion - locking community in own strictly moderated communication system doesn't work in the long term and exactly because of that approach we're having the yet another thread of "Anet doesn't communicate". 
---
They should accept that this playerbase doesn't constitute of little kids that can be distracted by festivals or gemstore offers but of people who have every right to know if it's worth to invest time and money in this title and every right to be dissatisfied by how the company talks to us. It's totally on them to fix this, I believe.
---
Even in group settings? I dont mean open world so much cause w/e goes there. I mean in areas like dungeons and fractals, raids, ranked pvp and wvw.
---
It's always south ...
---
&gt;fanboys who hated gear progression, but loved ascended gear and infusions when they were announced, defending it to the death
---
I'll never forget this time. Lost shores update; it was one of the times I was most tilted over a game development choice. I still wish they never added ascended but at this point it's irrelevant ofc.
---
The only group activities I do are open world events. I would probably open up chat for fractals and dungeons n stuff though. But I mostly playing it as a single player gamem and I think im not alone like that. I have a buddy who never stopped playing this game since release and he regards it as a single player game. Im just grateful Anet gives you an option to hide chat. Alot of mmos don't
---
How are the refusing support for it?
---
Here is a little something for redditors to think about, armchair consulting. Petition a business to implement the latest random buzzword you read in a Forbes article, because it’s “business 101”.
---
If you used to use any meta build before, first check most recent using the same or similar weapons and compare traits and rotations. It could give you some insight.
---
Also, worry not about mirage, it's still one of the top condi dps.
---
&gt; The problem is they had some layoffs a few months ago so them being silent about the future of the game is worrying the community.
---
That was in february(?) and they *brought* a roadmap for content and features for the next 2 years. 
---
&gt; Basically a lack of content/plans for the future has a few players acting like they're refugees.
---
The "lack of content/plans" became a popular reason to complain recently. Ironically we got more content in the last two months than we got since LS2. The thing with the plans is what I already said, they showed us their plans in February and that's still the case. However some people may think they need to hear the same information every few weeks to be sure that nothing changed. Also some people speculated very hard about season passes, "no more raids" and stuff and need a disproof for each of these speculations.
---
Any game designer or product manager knows the simple fact: someone who lapse one day is less likely to come back the next. Expand this into going on a hiatus and you can clearly tell this is a problem.
---
Every game out there is trying their hardest to get the players to come in everyday, and play more every time they come in.
---
GW2 is over here trying to sell "being able to go on a hiatus" as a feature. Like, okay...
---
same here.. have over 13k iron ore to get rid of.. and that's one of my lower material quantities..
---
Its not yet officially announced. Its organised hy MightyTeapot and his crew. You can look for updates on his social media. He will probably make announcement video when ready.
---
It's the ERP hosted by MightyTeapot, here is a link to the donation page which has a lot of the information about the event: https://matcherino.com/t/erp. An official announcement has not been made yet but he did mention there would be a trailer for it early August.
---
I mean, imagine that meme with two muscular arms and "Scourge", "Firebrand" written under each. Current balance will probably make it into "may the best scourigade win".
---
If I'm not mistaken (which I probably am) It happened around PoF or Ls4 release
---
Ok before you destroy my Ass, let me just say that I don't think that nerfs for the sake of nerds are healthy and I feel Chronos nerfs weren't what the class needed since people are jumping ship over it. 
---
Bringing outliers down is good, but what about the outliers on the other side? Bring underperformers up so the playing field is level.
---
You can make changes with out completely destroying a class.
---
Anyways that my 2 cents, I accept my fate.
---
and what's your point exactly?
---
that's just your taste
---
I’m not the owner of that screenshot, my account was banned at 12:53 on pic2, the one u said is at time 12:58
---
I'm probably not the best person for this topic, when I remberer that I havent even resched Heart of Thorns content yet. But I really doubt Im gonna open chat at all, unless I'm in an actua group. I don't really play to win either. I just admire the story and the world
---
You don't have to believe me. I don't care. But either way, I don't say it's an easy thing to accomplish, so your logic is shot to shit anyhow
---
Even better, they’ll win the armour and dump it multiple times to flex on others. Half an hour later, all the armours have died and the bomb is going nowhere.
---
I don't wanna share that. I'm sure you can understand. Also, it's probably not something you would be interested in.
---
Whats frustrating is that fixing pvp and wvw is so simple. Just implement ranked 2v2 and wvw alliances. That alone will bring back so many players. People are tired of the 5v5 luck of the draw. It leaves a sour taste in your mouth when there was nothing you could do because 3 of the 5 players on your team were hopeless. Its so much better to know that the loss was 50% your fault in a 2v2 than 20% your fault in a 5v5.
---
Except for the fact FB/Ren is used in most meta power comps, and even Might Ele was used in a KC record not too long ago. Most alternative options are amazing but the community likes to keep feeding itself the narrative that Chrono/Druidx2 is the only way to clear bosses.
---
If anything the other builds are almost too strong (31k cQB and Diviner Rev is basically a healer with stupid CC) but are heavily underutilized.
---
You broke the rules, you have to deal with the consequences. They did nothing wrong. 
---
Regarding to your screenshot *you* were the leader of the squad so you are responsible for your lfg. Even if you didn't start the squad, you didn't quit the lfg. You let it your lfg open and it was your responsibility. 
---
This ban was absolutely justified.
---
You should change the title into "leading a mobbing lfg squad causes ban". That's more accurate.
---
I stated my point in my comment, but essentially bringing top performers down is healthy for balance, doing it without giving the other classes a bump up is not. The top performers will just feel bad because they're still expected to perform because the underperformers don't have the tools they need to fill the gap.
---
Alrighty, thx for taking the time to reply and glhf in your adventures!
---
I admide people like you, sorry you had such a toxic experience 🙈
---
Yea, but also a return to some of the more interesting ones like the shadow stone, and the rift events which havent had much resolution
---
i can understand that. for similar reasons i would never play wow. i just cant stand its graphics
---
We can agree on one thing: Radio Silence is a bad thing and that anet should talk more.
---
  
---
But the problem is that a PvE player does not care if WvW gets no updates, a PvP player will not be interested in a PvE update same thing for a WvW player and every group is angry if one mode gets more updates then the one the player is playing which is somewhat understandable but there is no need to say that the game is dying because of that.
---
Sadly not, a german news did make artikle out of that drama, but did say that the complett community is falling apart.
---
One of their recent job adverts required console experience, so I still think they have at least on other project in the works.
---
Fuck anyone in the cummunity that makes posts larger than two sentences.
---
And if you remember communication before the layoffs were a lot higher than what they have been recently.  They would share with us upcoming content and what they were actually working on.  Now we barely see any ANet Dev respond on reddit.  Remember the AMA threads after episode releases?  That is also part of communication.
---
I do agree the lack of communication even at the start of the game was pretty shit, but also keep in mind.. that's the same time NCSoft had the "say so" over the game before ANet decided to "take control."  Once ANet took over the communication gap between developers and players ended up being a lot smaller than before.  Now it feels like that gap is wider since NCSoft is calling the shots again..
---
maybe because other games which are just as old or older as still going strong and still pumping out content without much sign of dying.
---
"You will never leave this place, D'Alessio" *intensifies*
---
Not liking the content they put out doesn't mean it's not proper content.
---
I get the point you're trying to make and I do agree with you, but:
---
* it would come off much better if you waited for team composition to be updated on the site, its currently marked out of date.
---
* by definition there will be 1 meta class for a specific role on each encounter. For a class to be rated good on SC pretty much means its meta for pug clears. It's not their fault if players can't think for themselves past a word.
---
* up until the recent changes to chrono (which I haven't experienced 1st hand, quit playing chrono when rene got its alac build), the FB/rene was brought up on par with the chrono/druid alternative and from the looks of it it still is.
---
* you could have found much better examples with healer/dps roles IMO, such as scrapper and tempest being amazing healers but almost never found in groups because they bring too little boons
---
That's easy, just get more than 1 competent Dev on every project oh wait ....
---
no gw2hook no beauty
---
+1 for this
---
I run gw on a i7 4770k and a 980. I get somewhere between 30 and 60 fps with d912pxy. As you might expect it varies a lot depending on the location and how many players are around. For example, [Champion's Dawn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion%27s_Dawn) will absolutely annihilate your fps unless you turn the reflections off, even if water isnt in sight.
---
I found that for 4k, postprocessing has an **enormous** impact, regardless of the location/player count. Setting it to low or turning it off is a must. Also, the player count should be set to medium at most. Don't set it to lowest or some aoe/npc will not appear, especially in raid (but you know that already, SC "35fps" Nico).
---
At that point the bottleneck isnt the cpu, even for my old 4770k : it's the gpu. During regular gameplay, I max out the gpu and the vram. 3GB of vram is definitely not enough for 4k.
---
Time to eye for those 2070 super...
---
Players demanded harder content. Here it is. Have fun.
---
&gt;I'll bet with you that someone is going to completely ignore all of your comment to answer your last statement with "muh you can't really do what you want".
---
The most practical long-term reward from consistent raiding is an effectively infinite supply of ascended gear for as many different builds and alts as you want. This comes both in the form of the pretty consistent random ascended drops and in Magnetite gains over time. It isn't raw gold, but it's hard to argue with best-in-slot gear.
---
It kind of sucks being essentially locked out of legendaries as someone who mainly raids (low overall gold income), but it's not like that really stops me from playing the game.
---
&gt; random and sudden advertising campaigns that have been direly missing for the last 7 years
---
NCSoft took over publishing, which includes advertising, after the layoffs. The global brand manager at Anet is still the same insufferably incompetent woman.
---
Are you talking about radio silince from Anet's side or between the playerbase? Both aee bad imo, just interested in which you were referring to.
---
I know that not everyone cares about what happens in the other game modes, but i mean we all still play the same game? Can't we be happy for the WvW players when they finally get a specialized mount in stead of just salty about it having little practical use outside of the gamemode? Why does the existence of different gamemodes have to result in a playerbase so fractured that you can barely tell we're all playing the same game?
---
I actually ran into one of those rifts (near the Ruins of Pikken Square, in Iron Marches) while leveling an alt, and decided to just go for it. People still do that, but nowhere near as much as they did on release.
---
And as I understand it, the Shadowstone itself is a loose end.
---
Lucky you. I had issues with both guild weapons and a 24 slot bag, but only got support for the weapons... I might try to ask again. I'll use your comment here as some ledge if you don't mind.
---
My problem was always that even if I asked for help on chat nobody was answering so I was trying to do whatever majority was doing, and if majority was as confused as me, then, well...
---
Veterans oneburn, what are you talking about?
---
Chaos, dueling and chrono.  Chaos is up up down. Dueling is up down up.  And chrono is middle middle down.
---
Would be amazing. It also sucks being in WvW and having it run out, only to see there's a long queue for the map you're in.
---
reminding you that this game actually has guilds (not like anet dont care anymore since gw2 is a singleplayer game)
---
I won't get into an argument and I know this should be taken with a grain of salt as glassdoor reviews are mostly made if you have something negative to say about the company but a reoccuring theme is "older leads, bad management"
---
[Glassdoor stuff](https://www.glassdoor.de/Bewertungen/ArenaNet-Bewertungen-E255820.htm?countryRedirect=true)
---
There’s nothing about a new expansion because they have said we are getting season 5 of living world.
---
I think you are confused. There wont be any support from anet after the announcement. They refuse promoting their own community.
---
Anet definitely does care, considering Gw2 is their only source of income dude to all other projects being put on hold or cancels with the pay offs. Their doing the best they can. I also remind you, dragon bash was awesome. If festivals or weekly events keep the trend of being awesome or at least interesting, then I’d say I’m content with the content. Pun absolutely intended
---
Enhancements lastign 24h are to make sure players visit their guild hall every once in awhile.
---
Personally, I consider it a brilliant idea.
---
However, the Guild Halls themselves went neglected...
---
you can do arah p1 with 2 and i think that's the minimum
---
I actually like challenging content, but Anet probably has the numbers here that we don't. They saw how people clamored for 'more challenge' after Core Tyria, and then players dropped sharply after HoT was 'too much challenge', after all.
---
To this day, you still see people recommending getting mounts first before HoT because it's too much challenge and getting mounts would let you skip a lot of it. Hell, you still see people complaining that they can't get through PoF/LS4 story sections solo every now and then.
---
There's been a trend for this....truism in gaming in the past 5-6 years or so that more challenge = better and that good games means challenging games. That's just not really true.
---
iirc there is a NPC in amnoon that exchange those soulbound bags for account bound (it doesn't change that they're still soulbound on use which is strange/dumb, but at least it doesn't lock them on a char)
---
I dont mean the kralkatorik rift stalkers, but rather the aetherblade-like charr and his rift portal device that sort of just did a dead end from like ls3
---
Another thing they could do is be used to access special bundle weapons or special skills for siege weapons.
---
As for NPC's you are likely right when it comes to offense.
---
When it comes to defense however it could be nice to be able to summon some extra help.
---
During prime time hours it wouldn't make a difference but during off hours it could reduce the chance your stuff gets capped by a very small group or single player by at least making them work harder to do so.
---
we should add a 3 teir difficulty system for pve?
---
id rock in hard mode and in return maybe +15% better loot?
---
as for returning to maps, i already go back to farm i guess thats not a me problem.
---
new content more frequently: its fine
---
and communication between anet and us yes i say let the people complain
---
Absolutely. And as a longtime veteran and new raider....looking at chat while raiding is difficult. There's so much new stuff going on you almost never look in the bottom left corner.
---
I mean, it took me a bit over a week to get to lvl15 on the free trial. I do not possess enough time to play regularly, mainly play in small bursts of a few hours during the weekends. Which is another reason why sub fees don't fit my way of gaming very much.
---
You are correct. According to Bobby Stein:
---
&gt;Jessica Price - Story Editor
---
&gt;Manages the season story, reviews and revises scripts, trailers, etc.
---
There's the official twitch channel: https://twitch.tv/guildwars2
---
Plus, as another user pointed out, there's a link for the streaming schedule. They update the schedule each week.
---
Just let's say it. They are American company with "inclusive" mindset, so freedom of speech on internet terrifies them. They try hard to not include their mindset into the game too blatantly, but outside of game it is different story (see forums moderation as well)
---
You can use plenty of different comps to kill the bosses more effectively. Dont judge the state of the game based on 100li pugs still running double druid for some reason
---
the only good thing about Dragon Bash was  because it returned after years. If they drop it again next year i doubt it will have 1/10 of its success..
---
thanks i just gotta dl twitch now lol.
---
will del. post soon
---
I disagree. The aesthetic, dragon area, achievements and rewards were all great.
---
Nothing will happen, maybe just few chrono players will learn something new.
---
My dream event would be one in which Anet gives any player that logs in during the three week period a free character expansion slot. The catch - the character occupying this slot can only be leveled in open world or dungeons (no tome babies). This would get a lot of people playing (admittedly aged) content all over Tyria that many haven't revisited in years. Anet would never give you something for free though, especially when they can sell it to you in the gem store.
---
The Heart of Thorns zones are my favorite area of the game. A good percentage of my guild was ready to quit after it was released, but most people stayed because I carried them through it. Not everyone is going to have someone like me in their guild willing to do that content 30 or 40 times with different people just so they can see it and even learn it.
---
Maybe?
---
Of course they dont!
---
So this guide is pretty old but its still (mostly) relevant.     
---
Rotation part especially needs to be focussed on.

Btw: Signet of Illusions is bugged too for reset new added shatters. As F1,F2,F3. Tested in WvW.
---
Don't listen to that. If you like the gameplay of mesmer then play it. Mesmer is still very good in Raids and fractals. You can play Mesmer as a solid power DPS, a very good condi DPS and it is still the best tank in the game and as boon support you are welcomed in the most groups.

video turned out nicely bro, keep up the great videos for reddit we &lt;3 it.

Crusader kings, transistor, hollow knight, dark souls, guild wars, portal, minecraft, etc.
---
I'm also sad there isn't any major new content but coming from other MMOs I was actually really used to having regular events outside of major things like winter and summer and all that jazz
---
Thank you. Guess i will wait then
---
Thank you!
---
There will be August anniversary sale for a whole month. New promotions daily.
---
Repeatable content for how long, right?  
---
For many WvW players (not all), the enjoyment of WvW is the actual 
---
 reward.  To them it's constantly repeatable content thanks in part that due to the PvP elements, WvW is rarely ever the same thing.  
---
WvW is indeed a great example of real repeatable content for those players.  
---
Fractals, though, aren't.  Fractals already exist and variety of them including CM.  Yet most players only do the dailies and stop and they're doing it only for the rewards, or mostly.  
---
You can add in another Fractal CM or 10, even!  But give it time, and you'll be right back here because now you're bored with all of it again.  Fractal players will consume and get bored of content faster than it can be produced.  Same as with the raids.  And same with most other content.  (This is all for only some players, the ones represented in this thread, for many others, there are no issues like this or boredom.)
---
A new daily for a random raid boss?  Sure, that sounds fine, as long as it is a different reward structure and follows traditional daily type rewards.  But that's not going to cure anything for most.  As it is, there are so many dailies in this game that the vast majority never complete all of them.  
---
It is possible to have true, repeatable content.  It already exists but you have to be the kind of player that can appreciate it.  WvW as you said is a great example but for many it doesn't appeal because of the rewards or time required ratio.  Others can find great enjoyment in trying out content with new builds and classes and configurations with each experiencing it somewhat differently.  Those are just a few examples.
---
What you need for true, repeatable content is content you play for the fun of it and NOT the reward (a concept lost to most MMO players).  
---
Guild vs Guild is a thought.  I don't know if it will be worth it.  What if it's created and people don't play it like many don't for SPvP?  The resources needed for it will take away from others.  It's well worth it if people will actually stick with it and it becomes actually popular.  I just doubt it will given SPvP popularity.  And, unofficially, guilds can already battle each other in WvW.
---
If you have ideas for that, I think you should create a thread on it.
---
GW2 is not the other games. Each game is different.
---
Great idea.  I agree with this.
---
It's actually funny how the salters complain about how their salt is being suppressed and The Casuals Are Oppressing Them By Being Positive When Everything Should Be Doom, because as a person who used to post here frequently, everything since June/July 2018 has been a cycle of nonstop daily whining about something or the other. It's insane. You get a few days of positivity and then it's back to another two weeks of constant sewage.
---
And you're not allowed to say you enjoy anything if it's not their specific game mode, lol.
---
In 7 years , they have never discounted gems. They aren't going to start.
---
Oh that's great news! Is there any announcement or post about it?

Here is a link to a past promotions from anniversary

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem\_Store/Anniversary\_Sales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/Anniversary_Sales)
---
This is only items, not gems itself. They never reduced price of gems. If you like the game you can buy some and convert gold to gems if you dont want to buy for money or you think it is a bit too expensive (price of gems)
---
It's not sur[rising "hardcore" raiders want to play a raid-focused game. GW2 isn't , and doesn't pretend to be. I don't see why people don't really get the difference?
---
But then this is not related to my post topic at all, I'm not talking about discounting items I'm talking about gem discounts or sales.
---
There's not going to be "a lot more" to announce. I think they are abandoning xpacs and moving to adding xpac shit to lw and charging for it. So 
---
1.) There isn't really anything but lw 5 TO announce
---
2.) They don't want to announce what they're actually doing because people will bitch.
---
True but that doesn't mean people won't compare it to other MMOs which are just as old or older and still going strong.
---
It's garbage anyway. Better to wait for Diablo 4.
---
This game's combat system is honestly wasted on 111 story content IMO, but my original response was more an explanation to the OP.
---
Warframe and GW2 are two very different games and just comparing them with "but they do it" isn't a good idea. From what I can see, you can buy a lot of disposable things with the Platinum in Warframe like boosters that run a certain time and then you have to buy them again. So the incentive is to let players buy something that they have to buy again after some time which is fundamentally different than GW2 which is mostly only one time purchases.
---
IIRC there never was a sale on gems specifically. There are sales on what you can buy with those gems though which pretty much is results in the same thing. Otherwise you would get more gold out of it and the economy would get hit hard because there is just so much more gold in the game.
---
I want to level up new class and because the Firebrigade comp seems to be popular right now, guardian and revenant seem like great choices to me. I also like both class' aestethics.
---
However, I want the class to also be strong solo in the open world, preferebly without a massive gear change. Which of these two classes do you think is more universaly useable?
---
Also with guardian, both of its elite specs are used right now but with revenant only renegade seems to be used.
---
So, what's your opinion? Which class is more worthwile for me to level?
---
Look at the downvotes you keep getting. If everyone misunderstands you, the problem is with what you said, not with EVERYONE ELSE.
---
You were wrong. You did not read the context properly and didn't understand the discussion you chimed in on, because you're the braindead hatechild of an asshole and their mentally challenged legal dependent.
---
Hey,
---
we are banning rampage, because we think it will produce unfun and boring gameplay. Even tho rampage just received a little nerf due to its CD duration increase, the issue that it has with its DMG is still a case.
---
A simple Google search would have shown you that ANet have a twitch account a d a YouTube account. 
---
You can also follow them on twitter, Facebook and tumbler
---
Hmm I would be happy for this too. As long as I can switch often as needed.
---
To be fair I often forget to go gh to get the buffs.
---
If u ever played in a high ranked game you will realise, that fighting against a CI mesmer is pretty cancer and unfun (i am a mesmer main myself).
---
Condi mesmer is still amazingly viable without the usage of this trait.
---
The reason to ban firebrand is, that it is still the best support class ingame. We want some variety in our games not only meta stuff.
---
Lastly, we didnt ban signet of mercy or any rezz trait, because with the change to scrapper and their new gyro, if we would have banned anything, scrapper would have become pretty powerful with its new gyro usage. 
---
i hope i could help
---
enlighten you on what? their goal was to reduce the barrier spam and tie it to dealing damage, reducing scrapper's passive sustain
---
whether this was needed/is justified is kinda irrelevant, no?
---
superspeed is extremely strong in team fights cuz mobility is strong! it pretty much negates any form of soft cc(except immobilize) and allows people to simply walk away from situations they'd otherwise die in..
---
for example superspeed might let you walk out of a scourge shade instead of wasting a dodge for it..how is that not strong?
---
mobility between points isn't even worth considering because you are often out of combat when you do that..however superspeed allows for better disengage
---
If you searched on the subreddit you would find that many players ask the same question. Yes the game goes on sale, but we don't know when the next time it will be.
---
The next possible time it could happen would be around August when the Anniversary of GW2 is and the game is 7 years old. Maybe even when Season 5 releases.
---
You can also look through the [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/) to find a sale
---
Thank you for this insight. It does make sense of a lot of the discord and vitriol going on in the community.
---
I did mention on this subreddit before that GW2 feels like 3.5 games rolled into 1 and developed by 1 game's worth of development resources.
---
Unfortunately it doesn't seem like there's gonna be easy answers with a product that tries to cater to everyone without the necessary resources. I appreciate the game does not pressure me to keep up while juggling a very busy adult life, but it will always result in unhappiness for people with more time on their hands and can consume more content.
---
It's strange how the game's PvE design to engineer the community to be more helpful and less anti-social is so successful that it's practically genre-defining, but yet its approach to having such distinct game modes that can be played all on its own without ever having to go into other modes has resulted in such schism within its own community.
---
I honestly think the community needs to step back and think on whats its doing.
---
I get it, Anet had layoffs and people feel uneasy, thats understandable... they want reassurance again understandable. But for crying out loud reading the comments below its like you're transported in a parallel universe that transcends any form of logic.
---
People who point out we do know season 5 is going to launch soon (should be mid next month actually based on the time table provided by anet) and they get downvoted, people point out that anet did tell us whats coming next and reassure us that the layoffs didnt have any major impact on gw2 with a post by Mike Z in April, they get downvoted. 
---
Downvoted why? Do people not know what downvoting is for? just in case here is what reddit says about the downvote button " If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it."... In short its a tool so that non-relevant posts to a topic like say spam can be hid from view by the community? How is pointing out when communication was made and what it said in reply to a concern about having no communication no relevant to the discussion? reddit netiquette suggests such posts should be upvoted since they're answers to the specific concerns yet looking below they were downvoted to well obscurity. I doubt that many people dont really know the true purpose of downvoting so the question becomes why do they want to censor attempts to correct the record? Its like they just want to show the world negativitiy about the game for some reason without allowing anyone to show how that negativity isnt entirely warranted! and again Why? whats there to gain by anyone?
---
Besides what exactly are people expecting here? We know Season 5 is coming, we know the normal schedule puts it in mid august. Do anet have to say that every week? and what happens if last minute during testing an issue is found and the patch gets delayed? Ohh then we'll have a crusade against Arenanet  because they "would have lied" Besides who does that? Let see ESO announced their next update already, scaleblreaker.. .Do each and every week post how its going to release on this specific day? no all they said is that its goign to be available 2H 2019! 6 months time range. 
---
what do we know about season 5 episode 1? its coming mid august += 2 weeks ! and yes maybe the layoffs effected it badly and they will not manage to hit the target this time... well thats happened in the past too, if that happens a week or two before midaugust they'll let us know the episode will be delayed. How is that no proper communication? 
---
Dont get me wrong, not saying Anet has mastered communication obviously they're not perfect, It would be perfectly fine for someone to reply to anyone pointing that communication out that they didnt touch on important topics such as if we are to expect an expansion at the end of season 5 and if so if it will be twice as large as POF or if they just started on it late. But hiding the fact they did communicate and let us know that things are progressing as normal after the layoffs is simply not okey. It looks more like an attempt to make Gw2 look bad by deceit then a concern you genuinely wish addressed. 
---
and talking of disingenuous it also unbelievable how many people in the comments are repeating the statement that festivals are rehashed content not even 2 weeks after we just finished a festival that had all its content revamped. Not a single game activity the festival offered (short of breaking the piniatas to be fair) was the same as it was last year! I could understand being worried the same might not be true for the festival of the four winds but acting like thats certainty right after being given an example of how thats not necessarily the case seems wrong.... Much more so acting like the festival we just had was the same like last years when it was totally different IS WRONG! 
---
If you genuinely want things to change for the better, I honestly suggest you (in general) take a step back to see how you're going about achieving your goal. Sit in Anets shoes, if they see someone complain about communication and then see people who point at that communication only to be downvoted into obscurity what message would you get as anet? That their communication is lacklaster? no if that was truly what the community wants they'd be thanking the people pointing them in the right direction not downvoting them. Just saying!
---
"Why dont the devs talk to us? I just want to politely tell them to die in a fire."
---
I thik certain people just got bored with the game
---
Oof, I'm calling my mum you're so mean!
---
As far as I can see you're the only one downvoting me at this point lol, fucking pathetic that you're still going with this btw.
---
Don't stop, you're making me laugh a lot!
---
Thanks for explanation
---
every time fractals(or silverwastes) get mentioned the reward somehow increases..it used to be 10-15, then 15-20 and now it's 30g!
---
You don't have to, but when it has a limited time offer every other week then you'll want to take advantage of it every time.
---
If the recent boss rush's community tiers was scaled the same as the meta fish's, the fact it took half a week for the meta rush but a full week for the boss rush shows that fewer people participated, in part no doubt because a lot of folks realized they could just do one and be done and were tired of the constant farming.
---
In your wardrobe?
---
Nothing happened. One steamer left for ff and all 10 psychofans started to troll around with freshly made accounts, spreading doom posts.
---
Remember, don't feed trolls folks!
---
Life is actually great! But thanks for your concern it really means a lot to me.
---
And that is what I find funny, anet designed them in a way where they have not to do to start the event and people behave like that the s5 does not release because the event is coming.
---
I'd normally just lurk but I feel like I should say something. Players don't just play one kind of content; WvW'ers play sPvP and PvE, just as sPvP players play WvW and PvE, and PvE players tend to at least dip into PvP to see what it's like.  
---
The negativity on this sub atm is not the result of merely a meaningful content drought, or divided playerbase, but of long term frustration and dissatisfaction with Guild Wars 2. From Balance patches that have us asking what the devs could possibly be thinking to implement things the way they did, to Week-long Timegates on the Skyscale collection, to a mount that completely broke a gamemode (and required a week of hotpatch nerfs), compounded with every patch bringing new bugs that have us wondering if there is in fact a GW2 QA team.  
---
This sub could benefit from a balance patch [venting] stickied post or tag around now.   
---
P.S. The Warclaw is definitely not just the Griffon Animation Rig with the wings clipped off.... [definitely.] (https://youtu.be/IKxXq6T3b2U?t=63)
---
If I were to buy the Living World Seasons what do I get? 
---
I am mostly interested in the maps and not the story. But afaik I can just use [Teleport to a friend] to access those maps (and I have tons of those…). Is there anything else the LW Seasons proivde/unlock besides the story? Are the map mechanics (meta/currency/etc.) gated behind the LW seasons?
---
I'm sure you're completely unaware of any issues people have with you.
---
Game is dead so good luck getting a group for the achievements you need
---
gw2 is obviusly not dead... but the flow of the update is embarassing and in 7 years they made soo many wrong decision... 
---
i think the first misstep was ascended and also fractals... we had dungeons, we loved dungeons we didn0t need fractals... 
---
then the china release... they spend a lot of time for that, we had the first expansion after 3 years and a lot of vaccum months to release a game that was in a completly different direction than asian mmo
---
the first expansion had some great feature and content... but dungeons was abandoned... raids came in and i loved raid soo much till w4 but yhea... dungeons for me was a very important type of content for gw2 and left them to die and not release new ones was a relly huge mistake.. cos it was a content for everyone , it was easy to access and it was SKIN REWARDING and awesome stories and i think that dungeons could be that kind of content to release with expansions to increase longevity and give something to replay for farm skins , money and other stuff
---
raid... i think this content was 1 of the most entertainment that arenanet made for gw2 was really fun and rewarding but than there was as usual some time release mistake... 3 wing in 6-7 months and then 9 months for the wing4... than the cheduling become something like 1 new wing every year... i mena... what about a precise scheduling like other mmos does?
---
fractals... they changed a lot of time all the infusion stuff , agony cap fractal level and again... i think all that stuff weren't needed in gw2... we had dungeons , fractals represent all that things that are in opposite direction with gw2 philosophy.. also all the mistlock rework.. thay spent soo many time to try a fun way to balance that and i think it was a lot of time wasted... 
---
i loved nightmare and 100cm... but then they also stopped to release cm mode.. so...wel gg
---
spvp aside also here a lot really a lot of wrong decesion... they kinda killed spvp when they completly decided to trow out of the window the esport side... im still waiting update about at , but after 2 year it seems still in a beta state...
---
wvwvw it was one of the major point of gw2 at the start.. but was left to die and alliance system is still in a when it's ready state... well again gg
---
No, not if you want player retention and growth or to actually attempt to try and capture a new audience. Dragon Bash isnt new we had this years ago. But if you're the type of player that not capable to doing end game content in gw2 then nothing i say really matters to you for the most part you are their target demographic who would rather have recycling festivals back to back than rather than actual game updates and improvements. Im just saying people who are actually capable of more than hitting 1 button at a time arent going to be satisfied with gw2 when they get one raid release a year, no WvW or PvP improvements, or maybe 2-3 fractals a year with no new CMs. But yeah Anet doesnt actually want to grab a new audience or improving their existing game modes just people that find open world as their main focus.
---
XD
---
The fact that you just can't stop yourself is pretty damning, dude.
---
Face it, this "conversation" ended a long time ago.
---
But you can.
---
Buy gems &gt; convert to gold &gt; buy legendary weapons/materials to craft ascended gear (which has the same stats as legendary armor).
---
Youd rather have mounts skins than them update the game mode with Alliances which they said they started working on (But not really ) 3-4 years ago.
---
This post here should like a 1000 upvotes... well maybe it could have been a little less aggressive but it has a very important message that is worth highlighting!
---
&gt;  If I was a dev, and I saw ALL this backlash  I would NOT be compelled to give them ANYTHING. 
---
I have lost count how many posts I've seen repeating how festivals are rehashed content right after they just reworked dragon bash for this year's release. Now we might get it all for free but its not free for arenanet. level designers had to create the arena, writers had to come up with the dialog, game designers had to design the adventure and the race, developers had to implement it ingame, etc... What incentive will Anet have to put in those resources if what they're going to get out of it is bad publicity? They went all in and litterally gave us new content to play every 2 weeks since season 4 ended and ironically this is the time when the community is crying content drought? And I get it people want fractals, raids and other more meaningful content but for seriously people need to also be realistic, this is small bite size content to keep people a little busy while they work on the next living story release naturally they cant create content of that scope while being mostly focused on working on the big stuff which likely includes both fractals and raids... this is no different then any other MMO out there really. Content development takes time, especially big releases and no game can release big updates without some downtime ! ITs common knowledge that it takes far longer to make content than it takes to consume it hence downtime is unavoidable!
---
how about just deleting raids altogether, should fix most of your problem areas....
---
Lol I was purged by this reddit for putting this out several month ago.
---
Yeah, those usually happy with the game would actually playing the game instead of complaining on reddit. Occasionally we get people praising the game on reddit but those posts are usually outnumbered by the more negative posts.
---
I am not necessarily blaming complainers either, as it is natural that people get upset over something they invested time in. I too complain more than I praise, I think its human nature. But because I can't relate with complainers about how the game is dying, I am implicitly annoyed by the spam.
---
Are you blind to irony, as well as context?
---
To make it clear: I have 1200 LI+LD and I am happy to have all classes in at least one fully ascended set plus trinkets, including necro and guardian in legendary armor. I never raided for rewards, simply for the fun of playing all those different builds, especially the support builds that have no value in open world. 
---
The thing is, if I wasn't raiding I wouldn't need all those armor sets in the first place. Ascended drops don't help me fund legendary weapons or gold to gem conversion. Who cares about account value?
---
The problem is criticism is always shot down, by the same anet apologist group, until the bucket runs over and people really really get fed up. 
---
The only way criticism in this game is heard is when enough players feel the negativity to counteract the majority of carebears.
---
The fact that these players suppress any and all valid criticism is the reason you get full on negativity like this. A simple counter reaction the result of ignoring criticism and letting a LOT of issues affecting pretty much every minority group in the game fester.
---
The truth is these carebears with their toxic attitude make constructive criticism impossible and fuel the divide between players.
---
Nope, but you're blind to being fucked with lol.
---
Lets be honest, PoE do so much more aside league reset every 3 month. Whole core mech revamps done every several leagues, new skill added every time, new passieves added as as well, making actual appeal to return and do the same thing again just for the sake of new build.
---
Im actually on a break right now, what happen with the game? I mean, we all dont know the direction of the game (plus the anet silent treatment) since months after PoF was released. Whats changing with that right now?
---
this game was one of the best mmos and had such a good game design and balance, till people went around whining just like i am to nerf ele nerf ele, nerf the fun out of this game, druid got deleted so we can have more diversified healing classes. you can go have fun with this garbage autoattack simulator im voicing my opinion.
---
SnowCrows hasn’t updated for some time. Maybe you should give the OP a fair warning that those builds may have changes (big or small) soonish.
---
Username checks out.
---
boosting to 80 gives you enough hero points to unlock everything from the bae class.  
---
however you also need to spend all those points, if you miss something from the base class you cannot start unlocking anything from the elite spec.
---
Have you seen the balance patches motherfucker?
---
&gt;3. no one likes a brain-dead autoattack simulator
---
Welcome to GW2, enjoy your stay.
---
Games is not dead and the achievments are still easily doable.
---
you described reaper. it was barely viable option and last patch killed it. people like it or not, but reaper do not have dodges/shield to survive. they rely on lifeforce which is their also main dps source. so by cutting healing in shroud (now you can't heal yourself in shroud) you losing dps which wasn't even that high. It was in the middle of pack. According benchmarks reaper was just 16th...
---
&gt; It shouldn't matter
---
Well it does matter because while the business model might be the same or "identical" as you put it how it is applied is very important in that matter.
---
Having disposable items that last only for a certain time will make players spend their "premium currency" on those things so they will have to buy new currency periodically. If you, on the other hand, provide one time only purchases for your whole account then this looks differently because you would only need to spend additional money on the new things.
---
Another thing is that those games are in completely different corners of a genre. Gw2 is a MMORPG, Warframe is a Koop 3rd person shooter. You don't connect to dedicated servers but have a P2P connection which means that Digital Extremes has a lot more wiggle room about managing their income because they have a lot less costs for servers.
---
Reducing the gem prices will have more of a negative effect on the overall economy!
---
Implying I'm still a fan of anet. I care for the game and I wish they'd fix the issues but they wont because anet is incompetent. And do I sure enjoy slowly watching it burn while the same people continue to scream everything is fine, seemingly as to convince themselves.
---
Wish List:
---
Wintersday Griffon Plush Skin
---
Dire Fern Hound Skin
---
it wasn't like this when tempest had a rotation, druid had a rotation, chronos had a rotation and ps warriors had a rotation
---
If you just autoattack in fractals, raids, wvw or pvp you will will not succeed unless you get carried from others.
---
top 10 anime comebacks.
---
stop it, get some help
---
Thats right, but now I‘m wondering why do they even offer you to buy the episode for 200 gems via the story panel if you get a guaranteed discount via the gemstore anyways?
---
No they've been giving criticism regarding issues for 7 years. Which has been repeatedly shot down by you peeps and thus allowed to fester. Now pvp, wvw, raids, expansions, guild content, rp, communities, dungeons, ... are all in the gutter, and clearly many players are upset with the state of the game to where you cant suppress them by telling them to gtfo.
---
The only difference is theres enough people to balance out the anet apologists, because of how many people are actually disappointed with gw2 atm.
---
There are PvP/wvw exclusive skins. And there are a shitton of more PvE exclusive skins that PvP/WvW can not get. When the new upcoming weapon set was announced there already were complains it is exclusive. One new exclusive weapon set after years! While PvE gets them with every LS release.
---
Ele got an overall buff in the last balance patch and has now the highest bursting condi build and one of the hardest rotations. So you clearly dont know what you are talking about.
---
There already are ways to get gems without even using money at all and i prefer that rather then anything any other game have. It give me a option to choose if i want to use real money or if i want to use my gold.
---
As a person who have done everything and completed all achievements in both seasons, I will have to say it is a tough call because both seasons map mechanics are tailored to two very different playstyles.  Everything earned in both seasons is gated to once per day per character, so you can farm anything heavily depending on how many lvl 80s you have.  Season 3 focuses on solo to small man group content where dailies rotate foot traffic on essential events.  Season 4 focuses on solo to mid size group content dealing with timed meta rotations.  Both seasons achievements will culminate into a legendary trinket upon completion.  Season 4 will eek out ahead in terms of currency aquisition in gold market value, however it is equally slammed with costly material sinks if you attempt to complete it's respective legendary trinket.   Season 3 is all about speed as you can complete all major event rotations in half the time compared to season 4.  Personally I would get both, however season 4 is where the population is focused right now
---
idk it kinda is, because items are chaper so you can buy more for the same amount of gems. You spend less money on gems that way.
---
&gt; it would come off much better **if you waited for team composition to be updated on the site**, its currently marked out of date.
---
&gt; **It's not their fault if players can't think for themselves past a word**
---
Aren't you contradicting yourself there?
---
Their aversion to split numbers between game modes did nothing good to the game. I got why they wanted to not do skills different things, but a skill that hits hard against a mob could still hit hard against a player if it deals less damage, because players usually have a lot less HP than mobs.
---
There are frequently sales. Unforture for you (and me with some alt accounts needing only HoT) HoT it self have not been on sale since forever. It only comes on sale if you buy PoF. If you do not buy PoF then HoT is not on sale. I wish they would stop doing that and make HoT go on sale as well so that you can choose what you want to buy.
---
The rushed to gemstore chair (again - a chair - a _fucking non-moving mount_) has clipping issues? I'm shocked. Utterly.
---
LMAO, Reaper has been performing better than Holosmith with an easier rotation.  They got rid of the sustain in shroud.  Something that's rightfully deserved as healing 5% of hits that are at least 10k base damage while under the effects of temporary hitpoints, is dumb.
---

Welcome to engaging GW2 experience in 2019.
---
I had someone in PvP proclaiming that Mesmer was still a top tier class for that because Mirage. 
---
It hasn't been top tier or even used by the top players for 2 or even 3 balance patches.
---
If you are crazy enough to play one single build for years on multiple accounts doing nothing but low tier farming like OP, 20k+ is a piece of cake. Before PoF 10k a month from berry farming + legendary crafting was quite manageable.
---
Just don't lose 5Head
---
Bro I feel u. I’m playing for like 4 month and still feel like a noob. So much Materials so much different items ans trophies I don’t know which is useful and for what etc. So I left gw2 last month and realized after a while that i only had been solo leveling and questing. Now im gonna try to comeback and join a guild because I think it will help me to get more into the game and don’t feel like a noob. I think that was the main problem or is the main problem when u play solo. U have to look up too many things
---
You must understand that the guys do not want to get distracted from watching netflix so they prefer it slow, without the need for them to help at all. 
---
A oneburn makes this harder, as those players still scale the meta up so if you have to hurry they have to contribute a little bit, instead of getting their participation reward for nothing.
---
New hairstyles, faces and other character customisation elements?
---
New emotes?
---
New guild functionalities?
---
People say "oh gw2 isn't a hardcore raiding game", so I ask what game *is* gw2?
---
So it's no PvP/WvW focused, it's not raid focused, it has barely any new replayable group instanced content.
---
It's not even anything to write home about on role playing since the range of emotes are pretty sad in comparison to other mmos. A lot of role players I'vr met have told me how surprisingly unfriendly gw2 is to ingame roleplaying. Character customisation is also nothing special after being abandoned with the exception of only humans for PoF and bit of Charr. 
---
Literally the only thing people can say is it's a "casual" game.
---
Cant wait to pla..pay for lootboxes on your phone?
---
LMAO. you clearly never played reaper and dont see how hard is even get into raid party. 8/10 times you being kicked.
---
Sure. I understand that. It just frustrates me that, even once the community knows the recipe for something, we have to step outside the game to find out what to do.
---
Buddy, After PoF Mike Z said GW2 wouldn’t get more expansions because LS is working. During his roadmap he failed to mention any future beyond LS 5. While I like to think an expansion is coming , there has been no indication.
---
Very well written, and I hate to be the person to just pick one part to add to but being a League of Legends player something else stuck out to me with the updates.
---
LoL updates at least on a 1-2 weekly basis, with some of the most beautiful patch notes I've ever seen. Alphabetic sorting of champs, icons, formatting. They're easy to read and get to the point with a brief description before the value changes as to why they're changed, and then the values that have changed.
---
GW2 has tonnes of words just clumped together in bullet points. It gets to the point where it's a gruelling task going through the patch notes. It's like I'm doing homework before I'm allowed to play and understand the game, rather than being excited and curious to see what's changed.
---
Nah. I look lots of things up, because it's convenient; I simply like to keep the game immersion. Plus there's a difference between "it's easier that way" and "you've got no real option".
---
well, why did you call a lot of the tasks you could do with your teams and friends meaningless, then? Is this making you dishonest?
---
/ wiki and the item; is your best friend in this game. It is the comprehensive guide to learn it you want to “get gud”. Took me a while to get used to it too but, it becomes part of the game once you are used to it.
---
If you would use your mouse to point click movement yes. If you rebind movement to W - simple legal 1 action macro, or even in-game keybind (eat up 1 slot, tho) PoE plays way differently. 
---
Binding most used skill to Q, E, R and mouse buttons also makes a huge impact on the joy of PoE endgame content and boss fights.
---
And the movement skills that are added/overhauled every 3 months makes game really action-combaty. Boss fights really on par and feels good.
---
But if you absolutely had to?
---
The ones leaving are the ones who keep the game alive through great videos who inspire the non hardcore gamers to play the game. Or even through ingame actions. I can guarantee through experience that once those are gone casuals will begin to leave as well. 
---
I for myself am done with anet and have bought FFXIV subscription.
---
Idk I'd argue that fb/firebrand and heal scourge are way more broken than distort share ever was.
---
With distort share you actually had to be careful with your timing. Aegis however is just as powerful and can be spammed almost nonstop with firebrand and with chrono the timing window is huge compared to distorts.
---
When distort share was a thing, half of the pug groups did greens on vg because half of the chronos weren't good enough to do it. Now we overheal it because it's so damn easy anyone can do it, the only people who do greens are those who are completely new to raiding and watched a guide from years and years ago.
---
And while I agree that Chaos Chrono was kind of ridiculous, they can shit out just as many boons with even better uptimes and more dps. What we have with fb/rene now is also kind of ridiculous.
---
After 7 years I might add.
---
Not sure if I'm missing some sarcasm here, but just in case, I'll try to phrase it differently :)
---
For me there is more of a group feeling customizing and interacting with up to 7 NPC heroes in GW1 to prepare for whatever challenge is ahead, then to bash a loot pinata for 2 min pressing 1 key with 50 people (to scale up rewards most likely) and we instantly part ways after that.
---
So I take it you play firebrand as a condi build in open world right? Something like the Quickbrand build from Nike!?
---
Why do people say this isn't new we had this years ago. Name ONE SINGLE ACTIVITY that was in this dragon bash that was in the one years ago. Dragon Arena? Nope?  Dragon Bash with the hammer? Nope.  The beetle race? Nope? The hologram stampede? Nope. The ONLY thing that was the same was pinata bashing. It was a new event. Stop just saying stuff to try to prove a point. Every part of it was new including the location it was held in.
---
More to the point, let's pretend that there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who have never tried Guild Wars 2 before. Let's pretend that 80% of those people are ALSO going to be more casual. Adding more stuff that's harder isn't going to appeal to those people.  More posts from more hard core players chase casual players away anyway. They see these posts and they think, this game is too hard for me, I don't raid. They think of raids or situations in other MMOs and they don't try it, because they don't know it's casual.  You don't necessarily expand your player base by adding niche content. Nor do you necessarily expand your playerbase by adding stuff other games do better or have more of. You expand your player base by playing to your strengths. 
---
I'm sure raids are good in this game, but they're not and have never been the mainstay or focus of the game.  And even if they draw a few people they're not necessarily going to keep those people.
---
In my opinion (and that's all this is anyway), the game has a better chance of getting new players by appealing to casuals. You can say that's because casuals have a lower standard of how much or what they need. Or they don't complain about balance. Or they don't want to farm so they'll drop some bucks in the cash shop occasionally. You can say all those things.
---
But I think that there aren't very many games competing in the casual open world space, where the open world is the game focus and that's a big plus. Running with your strengths is the way to build focus.
---
Tell me, do you think all the harder core players complaining on the first page of reddit for being unhappy is great advertising?  Because I have  guild full of casuals who mostly aren't unsatisfied with the game.
---
I don't care about world bosses, you don't care about world bosses. So why get angry over increased loot for world bosses?
---
Do what I do: Don't do it.
---
why not just look up the solution on the wiki like a normal person
---
It seems like they are ditching expansions altogether to me. I would not be surprised if LS5 or LS6 comes with new elite specs that are micro transactions from the gem store. They almost said as much with their video in November (I think?), they said that "upcoming living story will come with features usually reserved for expansion releases". As long as they are reasonably priced I don't really have an issue with it (like the bundle with them all is less than what an expansion would cost, they can't justify pricing them for more than an expansion's worth of content), but you will have to get ready for a lot of uneducated "omg this is pay to win!" posts.
---
That's all totally speculation and guesswork of course, but I get the feeling expansions are beyond their scope from now on.
---
The game literally has a /wiki command.
---
I quit 2 years ago in August and I am glad I did it. This game is sunking ship. Warframe have updates at least...
---
&gt; Nah.
---
ok, keep spiting yourself :)
---
Sometimes you have to be a team player when playing an mmo.
---
There was literally nothing similar to Dragon Arena in 2013. Even arguing that Stampede was similar to the random holoprojectors you'd solo is a bit of a stretch imo.
---
At that point you're basically saying "fighting the same mobs is the same content". That's like saying Seasons 3 and 4 had no new content then, since 90% of the mobs existes in earlier content.
---
You figured the secret. Use blind people in the army so they can shoot people through their covers !
---
Is this a screenshot of a cutscene?
---
Herald is generally better for open world because it can buff itself with offensive boons very easily.
---
I feel like I should add to this. A lot of people actually wanted EoC, myself included.  
---
The problem was many people gave actual feedback, and legitimate criticisms of the way they were implementing it: the rigid combat triangle, tiering, ability homogenization, etc. All things people wanted addressed but JageX flat out ignored. Hell, there are still to this day glaring bugs and issues from the \*\*first EoC beta\*\* that \*\*still\*\* haven't been fixed.
---
...I felt that in my chest.
---
I only raided in gw2 but from my research I dont see how its any different in other games. With the sole exception of WoW (thats not forget is a raid centered MMO) They all seemed pretty similar to Gw2 style of raids. 
---
ESO is about 4 bosses, FFXIV averages 3-4 bosses (some have 2, some have 4, a few have 6). 
---
There was 1 case where a raid was made of different wings but each wing was released 6+ months apart and each wing was called a raid  in the patch notes. (of course to be fair FFXIV releases raids at a higher frequency then gw2 but again its also more raid centric too) 
---
ESO and Lotro are pretty much 3-4 bosses too
---
So yeah I'd say what Gw2 does is pretty average! 
---
Also the 3 bosses per year isnt accurate in the 5 years since gw2 has had raids 2 years saw 2 raids releases and 3 saw only 1 (current year is still not over yet so it can go either way too early to say) and thats not taking into account that the first raid was released in November 2015 so its more like 2/2 really but thats nitpicking a little.
---
Its the end cutscene from season 4 episode 6.
---
This video only shows how to "convert" volatile magic into gold. From a "Volatile Magic Farm" video I would expect to see how to get that magic in the first place.
---
Totally agree. I am so used to just facerolling as a new player.
---
&gt; It's clear where the game ***sits***: *Premium chairs*.
---
FTFY
---
Skill animations occasionally get stuck in a loop. Happens with other skills and professions too, like chrono's continuum split, but it's just most visible with this animation. Retry the same skill? Get mounted/gliding? Sometimes it just go away itself after a while.
---
Presumably so the server is moved from the shared server the instance is hosted in for people just popping into their guild halls for select things like enhancements and farming to a more dedicated server instance that can handle the higher number of players with less lag issues.
---
Hybrid Fb/Rene + Chrono comp does more damage and doubles as second healer. That point is irrelevant. It still takes up 4 spots for support and heals.
---
She’s a mood
---
F
---
The arena is only one part of the festival tho
---
chrono is fine
---
That's just a glitch in the Mists. Pay no mind to it. Just move along and forget about it.
---
P I C N I C
---
1. Get a small group together for boonsharing.
---
2. Join a low population map for triple trouble/octovine.
---
3. Do insane amounts of dps to instakill boss on low scale map.
---
4. Feed on peoples hate.
---
Uh yes, do you have a lot of negative opinions about women?
---
Agreed. It's noticeable that somehow it is always the same group of classes that is 'meta' and others are 'not', or is this just me?
---
Well the mount race and adventures were certainly not around in 2013 either. I figured that was a given. So I focused on the other three.
---
Out of 6 activities, only one - Moa Racing - was old.
---
So in other words, the "best screenshot you made" is a movie screenshot where the only non-predetermined thing is your character's look?
---
I'd be cool if it was intregrated in-game like the trading post.
---
We already have an in-game browser, and it's used for way more things than most people think. 
---
May as well use it for something else.
---
And the wiki has a /wiki redirect to a page where it's explained how to use the wiki. 
---
So you can literally /wiki /wiki
---
You can say the same about farming nodes. Why not get the stuff in your inventory if it's station in your home instance. Short answer is mmorpg
---
Yes and it looks great. No point in shittalking straight forward
---
This would make many aspects much better and I think keep alot of players' attention in the game, I myself feel like I am getting bored with the guild wars 2 at the minute which is something I don't want to say. 
---
My daily routine if I can be bothered is logging on to simply run a few mindless money making farms to progress my Aurora then log off and with no news of anything new on the horizon my interest is waning.
---
I personally never really enjoyed living world episodes, most of them is just go to A go to B press F here press F there and then you just have an alright finale and people praise the whole episode because of said finale while the rest of the episode was interacting with 14 NPCs and done
---
Sorry you're wrong. I understand you arent as experienced as I am with the meta. You'll get there eventually.
---
Not only that, but the constant nerfs and changes to classes that make them less fun isn't helping to keep the veteran players engaged. A lot of people are tired of having the "what am i supposed to play now?" feeling after every patch.
---
Heh, 'member when "you're playing it wrong" got you a lot of flak? Simpler times. :D
---
Just for some fun, [have a look at mine](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhEQNAsdRnELDlphloB+pBMMjFcjqMAWtfxP9j/6/cGOhaD-jhwHgAq7PA8EAAA-e). I went for the swiss army knife. The build works with core, Chrono and Mirage. Build-in reflects, all the clones for shatter spam, blind on shatter. Basically unkillable as long as you stay active and I next to never have to change anything, because I have an answer to everything. Only downside is its 5k sustained DPS, but that's more than enough for regular trash and veterans and or the odd champion. And open world is more about burst anyway.
---
While there are certainly objective qualifiers to judge each game off of, you’re sort of trying rationalize a subjective aspect. If people want to try FF or WoW or go back to these games AND they are having fun (by their own standards not yours) then I see no problem.
---
There is a saying in the whiskey community that goes as such, “The best whiskey is the whiskey you like to drink, the way you like to drink it.” The same can be said for almost all things in life to include video games.
---
FFXIV has some smaller raids with a bunch of difficulty tiers but the release cadance is nowhere near close to GW2. It's a game that actually trades blows with WoW in terms of raid content. I've no idea about ESO as I've never been interested in that game and can't comment on it but people seem to be happy with their new expansion, whatever it contains.
---
I mean, FFXIV combat is literally just WoW's combat, but the GCD is much longer so it's just a more boring version of that. You can take a sip of your coffee between every GCD.
---
&gt; 3. Completely drop LS model in favour of features and bugfixes before releasing new content that we actually want and that won't end in 2h.
---
I really am not sure why they even decided to go that route when expansions have been their main income-spikes. Yeah, it is nice to have continuous new content as LS episodes but an expansion is what hooks people back with a big bag of content drop. LS will simply act as complete-and-done content
---
You got great taste =D
---
The black smokey aura was from ghostly infusion.
---
I shaded it black in the picture.
---
What made you such a hateful person?
---
(wow)[https://pics.me.me/wow-27517860.png]
---
Your guild full of casuals arent complaining bc outside of Open World they dont do anything else. You arent the ones discovering game bugs with incorrect damage modifers or stat traitlines that are just nonfunctional. But yes the Dragon Arena im so glad so much time went into something like this that is actually more unrewarding the longer you progress through it truely amazing. Hologram Stampede, yes very ingenius how they recreated a standard meta event to operate on rotating maps, really impressed about the coordination needed to actually succeed the event..... And who can forget the location, why yes they should be praised on having a generic festival outside of LA or  DR for the first time in 7 years, really breaking the mold. And yes i do think its good advertising because if youre looking for a game that isnt going to waste your time by updating its endgame content more than 1-2 times a year you should never pick up guild wars if youre expecting a game that cant be played on autopilot simulator. You can literally play all of open world 1-80 without using a single ability. So yes its great advertisment
---
Dragon Bash was new content in my opinion, and it was pretty good for a festival
---
I definitely understand that. I just figured it could be a good incentive tool to get he player to play or try game maidens they might not. And maybe it best to avoid giving buffs to WvW and PvP, but just thought it could be a way to bring the community together more. Thank you for your time.
---
Exactly, if you like that game then go play it, if you don't stop playing it.
---
Games are different for a reason so that players can find what they like most and stick to it until they don't want to.
---
That a game is better than another is just your own opinion that not everyone shares.
---
This guy is right. I've played GW2 for 5k, FF14 for 4k hours and just started WoW. GW2 has the best combat out of the 3, but man does WoW blow FF14 out of the fucking water.  Honestly, people should switch over to WoW (or Classic) instead of FF14. You'll thank us later.
---
Every single one of you who hasnt got every skin, every unlockable and every achievement in the game should really not complain about a "lack of content". WPs master series shows that really well just how much content there is you just have to DO it. If the specific comtent in question is not your cup of tea thats fine but saying there is just "no content" is just not true. If you dont care about achievements or skins then maybe gw2 just isnt the game for you.
---
I raid alot and ofcourse id like some new raid since the old ones are a bit boring by now but if i really want to play gw2 i will ALWAYS find something fun to do. 
---
If you want exploration do the achievements youll see areas youve never seen before.
---
If you want high difficulty content play pvp, only start crying about the difficulty of the game if you are #1there.
---
And if you want some fun community stuff get a guild and do wvw, guild events or world bosses.
---
By just restricting yourself to one of the things guildwars offers its your own fault that the game has no content for you!
---
Both games are pretty good at what they do, but BfA has had a lot of bad/meh publicity these last couple of month. 
---
I for one have played and enjoyed them both but I will spend the next month in FFXIV because I enjoy the levelling of multiple classes on one character, the aesthetics and music, and even the story. I also feel like FF is more similar to GW2 in terms of visuals and that might add to it.
---
 I will probably spend some more time in WoW next expac, when it has become a more alt-friendly game.
---
Doesnt that change after lvl 50 or so? Combat gets much faster (I was told so)
---
I understand that its hard for people without much experience to understand what the proper way to do it is, but if you would refrain from spreading misinformation I would greatly appreciate it.
---
chat: "wait for South guys"
---
system: *____ octovine has been destroyed*
---
chat: *panicked screaming*
---
Cheers mate!
---
Are you talking about the disaster that is WoW BfA or the rancid disaster that is WoW Classic? If the latter, download RetroWoW now and see how fast you will be bored to tears.
---
Nothing to do with a great advertisement. It's not a recycled event PERIOD. End of story. You don't like the content? You think the content design had problems? Fine. It was still new content. And I guarantee you more people took part in it than take part in raids. I'm 100% sure of that.  
---
My casual guild doesn't find bugs in skills, that's true. But many of them spend money in the cash shop. And most of them are happy with the game most of the time. 
---
Notice how some hard core players feel the need to belittle people who play the game differently or aren't as hard core about it? Why is that? You're angry at us for enjoying ourselves?
---
The game is fit for players who like what we like right now. And I'm pretty sure there are more of us. If you're going to build a market that's how you do it.  It's probably a niche market. But I'm pretty sure it's a decent sized niche market.
---
&gt; I like your friendly attitude. Unfortunately I disagree. From my point of view this community has reached a point where many casual players are enemies / opposition, not in any way an ally. If I could play the game while avoiding these players I would.
---
Honestly Eth, I think we've reached that point too.  I wish we hadn't, and I think ArenaNet really wanted to they could probably work to change community outlook, but I suspect people in leadership positions at ArenaNet steer clear of Reddit.  They probably think that we're crazy, unreasonable or are just about as disconnected from us as we are from eachother.  
---
The ratios of player population make it nearly impossible to satisfy any one element of the community.  I think this sort of a schism is an inevitability, and players that want more content will probably be happier elsewhere at this point.  I believe that the game goes a little too far out of its way to let people take passive roles; riding bandwagons than helping to create their own or getting involved with any form of in-game community leadership.  I think what it's also true is that the social effort doesn't match the reward.  
---
I think the community has definitely gotten worse over time.  I don't really want to be a part of it anymore thanks to people like Kalamari/Krall, Hinawarden and Shaman. I feel like it's impossible to have any sort of reasonable discussion without people asking for quantifiable proof *because* they know there aren't reliable metrics.  It's an easy way to shut-down and quash discussion.  I'm getting sick of people's inability to distinguish between criticism and negativity, and I've realized it's either their way or the highway.  
---
I think all people really want to see from ArenaNet is some transparent communication, and while they're pessimistic or waiting out the ERP -- they're pretty much emotionally drained.  People seem to lack the ability to see frustration as a spectrum.  The point I was trying to get here is that we're not all on the same team and ArenaNet doesn't do enough to foster good-will.  If they wanted to they totally could give people reasons to care about inter-community relations, but what's easiest for the game isn't best for the game.
---
Took a look at it. Not sure I could use your build either, but I might give it a go anyway, just to see.
---
I'm afraid you'll have to kill her, to keep the timeline in check and all. Go ahead. *Do it*.
---
i guess it was coded in a way that not a individual player got a buff depending on the server he played on, but everyone on a map which was hosted on server x.  
---
since pve has no servers anymore but megaservers...for example it doesn't matter if you are on server vabbi or riverside, in pve you can be placed on the same map together...the feature just got removed instead of reworked...else everyone would just have different buffs and whatnot. sounds like a hot mess / extra traffic to calculate.
---
I also agree tho
---
Potato quality proof from last night. You just have to believe.
---
https://imgur.com/h4IFyDO
---
It should be endless or if not possible let it last for 2years+ like those guardian aegis boons. I barely ever use the GH buffs because it is such an annoyance to refresh them.
---
Wow isn't alt friendly enough for some people. In FF XIV you can do everything on one character. Those are both different from Guild Wars 2.  
---
Gee it's almost like different games appeal to different people for different reasons. Who'd have thunk it. 
---
More to the point, I prefer Guild Wars 2 to WoW or FF XIV. Shrugs.
---
&gt;  people swinging in to say everyone should abandon ship and flee to xiv are trying to act like that game is some golden standard of how to run an MMO, and that it's flaws are negligible
---
The only thing in which FFXIV (and ESO) are better than gw2 is that those games are more predictable. You know well ahead of time what content updates gonna arrive and when. Case in point, ESO for the last 3 years:
---
- February: dungeon DLC containing 2 dungeons 
---
- Late May (PC) / early June (console): "big" expansion with 1 new zone, 1 raid, some public dungeon bosses and a good chunk of story
---
- August: another dungeon DLC with 2 more dungeons
---
- Late Oct / early Nov: smaller story DLC with a new map, world bosses and public dungeons - comparable to the size of a GW2 LS episode
---
FFXIV is similar too, with 2 years between expansions, and players can pretty accurately guess the upcoming patches' release dates and contents based on the previous 2 expansions and the base game - so their cadence is also reliable.
---
This is what GW2 lacks sorely - I think they should commit to a fixed schedule of 4-5 LS episodes per year, and maybe one raid per year, just like ESO did.
---
Nonono, it's just Mordrem Bondage, it's totally safe /s
---
It is a recycled event PERIOD. well yes when the majority of the people youre talking about have no idea how core game mechanics work no wonder Anet gets away with everything when all they have to do is put another shiny in the gemstore. How exactly did i belittle you again, by saying you dont play other game modes so you dont understand how Anet is terrible at keeping them updated. Even when we do get updates its catered specially to people who DONT PLAY THE GAME MODE. And thats how i know people are leaving and arent coming back
---
Both WoW and FF are lacking compared to GW2 who excels at it (bar visual clutter and rough balance in some areas).
---
If only Arenanet was confident enough in the amazing systems they have and focused more in exploiting the capabilities of that combat in PvP, WvW and end-game PvE, instead of wasting it away by making pressing 11111 in open world the main way to play this game...
---
Thread removed: Not relevant to Guild Wars 2.
---
I would make 10 more ranger characters if this was the case, just sayin.
---
That is old. Usually skill replacements skill have weapon traits active, like necros shroud or holomode. It could work differently for eles because of their unique attunement mechanic that count as weapons for some things like sigils and weavers sword trait is the only weapon trait ele has, so maybe a weird interaction, that got overlooked.
---
Recently played on a map that was new for me (Jahai Bluffs), and unintentionally almost crashed an "Don't mind if I interrupt" try, because I did the pre event even tho there weren't enough people yet (I did not know either of those things). Didn't read say and map chat for some reason, and only because somebody whispered me I stopped.
---
So, don't stop - most of the time it's genuinely not knowing better.
---
Okay, it's recycled because you say it's recycled in spite of all evidence to the contrary.  
---
Do you have any idea of how many people I've seen leave that say they're not coming back that have come back?  Feel free to get the last word, I'm done with this discussion.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Lmao what a twat
---
This. Watched it hoping for some new tips for farming VM. Currently I'm doing Thunderhead orb farm, easy LS4 dailies, Palawadan and various other metas, but I'm always looking for more ways to increase my VM farming capacity.
---
[removed]
---
it was in NO WAY new
---
Who?
---
All of that, yes its fine because we know whats there. Season 5 though, whats comming with it, whats the future
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/990039#Comment_990039
---
If you played chrono yourself and quit looking at the builds on paper (it's completely different in practice) then you'd know how unfun and annoying it is.
---
The loudest people are usually the ones who are the most passionate. If someone comes in here to stir up voice for this problem and that, a good portion of the time it's because they're upset that this game they love so much isn't living up to the potential it could, not because they outright hate it. We're all here because we care about gw2 to some degree, be it talking negatively or positively.
---
the "Panic" and all its badly spelled versions was entertaining.
---
That would open too many bad doors. I mean, wiki is still freely editable by people outside Anet, and thus could bring in the content that would collide with age rating, for example. Anet would have to approve everything on wiki to have good case that nothing bad happens, and that would basically cripple whole project.
---
&gt;less lag issues.
---
funny how that entire line of thought backfires when you try to get 40 people in and everyone has to continually hit "yes" and load into a new instance over and over and over and over again for 45 minutes straight.
---
It actually is, though. Condi CI mesmer is one of the strongest builds available for ranked queues.
---
I fully agree.
---
As you rightfully state there isnt a way for me to play this game as I enjoy, regardless of howmuch effort is put in. So frankly its better not to. I'll play casually as I'm told to do, but each time there's less people worth playing with remaining and it's less likely to have stuff to do.
---
Anet wont turn their ship around. The community says they only want casuals yet bandwagon and lie about experience to desperately play with veterans on the daily, blaming a tiny minority for not catering to them. Until the content is full dead - looking at NA to gauge what that looks like. 
---
I'm here to watch monkeys pretend this truly is the best mmo and community while they actively drive it into the ground. I dont doubt their denial will continue and even if they dont get any content for years will claim things are great because the servers are still up. It's pretty good entertainment.
---
Basically the solution ingame exists, jsut get 1 of each item in the game and go try it with your Dusk into Mystic Forge. What will light up, is possible candidate into the recipe. 
---
PS: this is how people originally found out as well.
---
Sycophant. 
---
Like "[White Mantle Sycophant](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Sycophant)". And they say you do not learn anything playing games. 
---
Wait. You did mean psycho fan? Was that an intentional pun on sycophant or just a coincidence?
---
This is a panic laden post with almost nothing to back it up. Let's see where the quarterly reports are in the weeks and months to come, because they're not noticably declining. Are you getting your view of the health of the game from reddit? Do you know how many times people leave when other games come out, only to eventually return?  Why does this dance keep happening? Why don't people learn from the last time it happened.
---
Two months ago we finished a living world episode that got broadly good reviews. More people liked it than disliked in my opinion and it seemed to have been well received on reddit. Most of the posts about it were positive.
---
One month ago, people were excited by Dragon Bash on reddit. One month ago.  We know Season 5 is coming. 
---
And a major expansion is coming out from a big game with a popular IP.  So people are like watching like this is batman. Is the end of the dynamic duo?
---
Maybe if we repeat the question 400 times on reddit it won't happen.  
---
No, I'm not convinced this is the end, nor am I convinced Season 5 is the last season. When I see sales slip for 3 consecutive quarters we can talk about it, but this game is doing better now than it was in the same time frame after Heart of Thorns.
---
This is a panic with nothing to justify it.  There are no signs, just a bunch of people speculation.
---
In my opinion, a lot of hard core players probably will leave. In my opinion we'll continue to get new casual players.  When people are getting tired of FF XIV, in three or four months, Anet will announce something. Why do I think this? 
---
Because this is what they've done in the past.  Man I'm tired of going through this pointless panic every time a new game/expansion comes out.
---
It's quite twitchy, fair warning. I've gotten into a bit of a specific rhythm that works absolute wonders with that build, but without that routine I'd imagine that one dies a lot. Heh. Especially if you take on really large groups of enemies at once.
---
The advantage is that you have a fuckton of defences. You can chain your mirage dodges wih weapon swaps for more dodges with your sword 2 and blinds on shatter to basically avoid next to all damage for unti8l everything is dead. Your focus phantasm keeps projectiles off of you in the meanwhile.
---
Usually nothing stands anymore once you went through your greatword burst, shatters and sword 2. If you got a group of enemies of 10+, you can pick off the rest during distortion or a heal or both, if need be. "Desert Distortion" is a real miracle worker there.
---
The only difference between the build on a mirage and on a chronomancer is that you can't deal damage *while you dodge*, but your wells and chronophantasma should make more than up for that.
---
There’s three obvious possible answers for what’s in the future.
---
1) Season Six
---
2) Expansion 3
---
3) GW2 is complete 
---
And they’ll tell us at the end of season 5
---
Much appreciated; I was trying to look at Storm Crows stuff, but I couldn't find a date for the benchmarks, and it ddin't look like non-Chrono was on there.
---
Great idea!
---
North always comes through eventually.
---
It's all trivial solo content though?
---
Then I probably won't be trying it. I'm 57 years old. My twitchy days are long behind me. That's why I use a lot of the builds I use.
---
ty for info. i tought it was gone with megaservers...but tbh i never paid much attention to that system.  
---
guess i should have used wiki first x)
---
Just talk to people more in chat, sometimes it is the difference from ebing alone....and sometimes it is nice first step for new guild membership.
---
For those materials...what fits into material storage, is good to keep. What doesn't, check the cost on trading post and decide based on that. If it is not tradeable, then just wiki it, it will be not too much of that.
---
I don't think I can convey to you how happy I'll be never having to read one of your comments again Kal.
---
As a power gs ranger I swear I have a giant bird on me about 50% of the time lol.
---
If I'm an MMO developer, I sure as hell won't be announcing an expac that I can't talk about in detail in the middle of the Shadowbringers hype. It'll just get completely swallowed and go unnoticed by everyone except the hardcore community.
---
For me it's the the skill tree that looks as convoluted as a painting by M.C. Escher on LSD and not having proper currency management.
---
The game has lots of great features, but when it has something that will put you off, it will put you off hard. Kind of a bit all or nothing.
---
Atm I treat gw2 exactly as I treat Skyrim, and at the moment gw2 is like solo RPG with optional multiplayer stuff for me to do when I feel like it. When I treat the game this way I don't have any problems with it and I can play without getting too bored. So I am content with doing some solo stuff on PvE (collections, fashion etc.) and solo roaming in WvW atm.
---
I used to have problems with the game when I was more into multiplayer content. I regularly did CMs fractals for example, but at some point I noticed that we wouldn't have any more CMs after Shattered Observatory and I didn't really feel like grinding Fractal God so I quit doing them. Then I progressively came to realize that the dev focus has shifted to open world content, and luckily, I was able to adapt myself to solo content as well (lets be real, the multiplayer open world is you being solo in a sea of people with little interaction). 
---
So I can understand why players who exhausted the cooperative content available in the game may be upset, though I can't relate too much as I kinda moved on.
---
True, but it's nowhere near the levels of other holidays. It's been 6 six years and they added the dragon arena. Again, it's not new to the game, but I'd wager it was new to 75% of the current player base.
---
Psycho fans are usually people who are not just fans but they intentionally or unintentionally literally worship their idol, doing same stuff and even going on holy wars against things their idol don't like (in this case "anymore").
---
But you might be right, perhaps they are white mantle
---
Thanks for the catch on that!  One of the first things I saw in the game back when it came out was Frostfang, and I finally got it in 2017.  Got kicked from too many groups for playing an old power warrior build and figured I'd try another class with it, as I love the aesthetic.
---
I remember playing rev and died... a lot.  Did T4s with that (just swapped my condi war gear onto him) and though it was an interesting playstyle, didn't feel all that fun.  Finally tried condi-mirage and it really felt like an interesting change of pace when compared to my general condi preference (axe/torch+sb ranger, sword/torch+LB bers, etc.).
---
I will need to keep playing around with that and try and get used to whatever rotation I can muster, which looks like a lot of shattering (honestly one of the pain points I have for base power mesmer which I played a bit back near release since everyone wanted portals and we all had a mesmer to help with wvw/jump puzzles).
---
Albeit a sentence of input, it's significant (coupled with the below responses).
---
I almost had a stroke reading this
---
NEXT MEME
---
No actually, people like you who are fake nice and saying "just leave :)" to other players are the ones that are the worst in a community. This passive aggressive community that is all pretend "nice" on top of low content is why I quit GW2
---
He just know know knows.
---
If we make it that long
---
what language, if not English, is this written for?
---
Guilds are large groups of people that come together once a week to kill Poobadoo
---
problem i found more annoying is doing the pre event then wair like for ever doing nothing until the armor be usefull.. bah, ppl give up the armor and go do something fun with their time.
---
So all you did was press "prntscrn". If you had titled this saying "love the work the devs put in to making this beautiful shot" or something it'd be better. But as it is it seems like you're just taking credit for something other people did. 
---
You didn't take the time to find a nice location, get the right lighting and angles, and posing your character to make a screenshot. You just pressed a button.
---
That's quality armor!
---
Doesn't literally anyone has that screenshot?
---
You gain 1200 health when you wield a sword, if you're wielding an axe or a shield or a greatsword or a hammer or a bow, you're not wielding a sword.
---
I wasn't really bashing anet, they made a great game and most Dev studios are pretty much the same. GGG is just the ideal game company. CCP from Eve are really good too, they were planning an working on planet fps mode, did a ton of work in it, and just flat out said "sorry guys this just doesn't fit and isn't up to our standards so we're scrapping it".
---
I always start with chest then legs, and I hen the others.
---
oh no the evil ess jay double-u's at arenanet are going to ruin our vidyo game
---
He probably got tired of everyone fighting him ranged.
---
I'd flip out too.
---
Both sides are correct. Thing is, why would you ever pick a side? Imagine starting a civil war amongst the player base. If only anet created content for everyone game mode not just pve (we just got raids so imo doesn’t count)
---
That whole cutscene was fantastic. It really shows of how far they've come. Compare that to the gates of Fort Trinity/Shores of Arah cutscene at the end of the personal story where we're just sort of awkwardly standing there.
---
Quite the contrary.
---
WvWers do the hard work and some PvE leecher reaps the benefits without ever stepping in WvW, just because they picked that world or transferred there? 
---
Now that's carebear stuff.  
---
Better get rid of the bonuses altogether than have someone coast on someone else's efforts.
---
&gt;I dont think its feasible in this sub to point out mistakes to people on balance especially if they avoid gameplay where balance matters. Note that I do not know what the balance discussion was about at all.
---
Pointing our my mistake was incredibly simple to do: I had simply overlooked something in the patch notes which offset the thing I was talking about. Balance is needed in all game modes, and while it is more important in competitive game modes, that sort of 'you don't play this, so your opinion doesn't matter' is what I am talking about. That's the sort of thing that drives division and resentment.
---
I mean, I could flip it and say that raiding in this game is a joke, and that WvW is a zergfest, so balance in both of those game modes don't matter. However, I'm not an ass, I realize there is more to the game modes than that, and I realize that even if I think that, other people still desire balance in the modes.
---
&gt;Story is "balanced" around being TRIVIAL. You can use literally any gear, traits and utilities and clear pretty much every story instance. Concepts such as power budget or tradeoffs for balance do not exist here.
---
I will disagree here. Doing certain achievements solo in a story instance can be more gear dependent than raids or wvw where you can be carried by your team.
---
Regardless, increasing my power level is something I care about. I track my DPS, and I care if I do 13k vs 12k DPS (or whatever), and I work to constantly improve it. Just because I *can* clear a story instance with 2k DPS, doesn't mean I *want* to do that.
---
&gt;Its nearly impossible to argue balance with players who severely lack understanding of the game. The difference is just far too large. It might feel mean your opinions arent validated but frankly... why should they be?
---
Shrug, I disagree with this mindset, and drives the division that I was talking about above. Also the "severely lack understanding of the game" is a huge assumption based off the very little information I gave you, which again further drives home the point.
---
&gt;If someone tells me building a wall will keep the immigrants out, and since they immigrate from Mexico its Mexico that should pay for it then you laugh because they're clearly so clueless you cant have an actual debate. Sure they feel their opinion is important, but you cant have a fact based discussion because if they were willing to apply facts or logic they could never reach their conclusion in the first place. It's like discussing quantum mechanics with a third grader... fun exercise but pretty futile.
---
There is a pretty huge difference between someone who plays a game and not at a top tier level giving input on said game, to someone who has no expertise on immigration or engineering putting their opinion on a wall to keep immigrants out.
---
You know I honestly don't think its the content people are annoyed with in terms of content whether you like it or not since episode 6 we have had a steady stream of content. We got episode 6, we then got vision, the PoF meta updates and the meta event week which I would say was a success. We then got the raid and the destabilised magic current event and finally we got Dragon Bash. I think what people what is news about season 5 I think if Anet came out with a blog not a release date but just a blog post on what season 5 is like, what will be different, are there 3 teams like on season 4 or 4 teams like the 4 fully staffed content teams mentioned in the whats next for GW2 blog. How is season 5 different to season 4, they have mentioned expansion like features what do they mean by that. If Anet did this I honestly think these "Is GW2 dying" reddit posts will stop or at least there will be fewer of them. Its not the content people are sick of. Its the no communication from Anet on season 5 and the future.
---
I am still playing core radiant hammer.. 
---
It is still working good enough in plat
---
&gt; Is that 5 damage from the ability or 5 damage from some kind of level-up modifier?
---
It's 5 damage from an ability. Admittedly, changes that small are usually implemented to spammable abilities with low base values. Ability scaling is listed independently in LoL, like "100 damage (+0.7 AP) (+5% max HP)(+1.6 bonus AD)", and those often get tweaked too.  
---
&gt; But my point was the subjective perspective of someone looking at patch notes. GW2's recently has had a lot more substantial shakeups
---
On one hand, yes. On the other, patch notes can be deceptive. Seemingly insignificant tweaks may result in large changes, and walls of patch notes can fail to shift the actual balance in a meaningful way.
---
No, I would want the skin.
---
Hey, that I can get behind. I, too, enjoy the efficiency of a team of tightly controlled NPCs rather than a herd of headless chickens. But I don't feel like I'm in a group. They NPCs. It's a solo player part. I feel like part of a group when I'm actually a part of a group of people. Be that the Fire Elemental or Dragonfall. They run around, do their own thing, talk, pop toys, spam mapchat. You know. People stuff.
---
The in-game command "/wiki itemname" is in the base game and directs you to the relevant wiki page. The wiki is pretty officially integrated that way and it's the best source of info.
---
You and twenty thousand others ^^ - but it was a very beautiful moment, indeed!
---
&gt; 10% DPS increase is not game breaking
---
For condi dps the difference is even smaller (around 6% depending on build)
---
You were talking about finding meaning in a lot of things that don't rly have any meaning, by experiencing these "meaningless activities" with friends. Thus, the "meaningless" part is highly subjective.
---
That's what I wanted you to figure yourself. You call this meaningless, other might call things valuable to you meaningless, ect.
---
I think I have the solution to this problem: let's nerf thief some more in the most random ways possible. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
low effort posts aren't necessary, and this has been done before [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqofop/spoiler\_replayed\_the\_final\_instance\_just\_to\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqofop/spoiler_replayed_the_final_instance_just_to_get/)
---
No tldr, downvoting.
---
pSlb is simple when you look at it, but once you actually play it you realize that all the skills cancel each other. Since you can't just queue shit like you can on other classes, you need to be really good with timing to get good DPS. Plus, dealing with those animation locks on actual bosses is pretty hard.
---
You're right about sb³ being simple, but it's just not really a good build. Add in the fact that mirage absolutely dominates all the condi fights, and any good player will learn mirage over cSlb... which just leaves the bottom of the barrel players on that class.
---
Bex is an exiled national treasure.
---
See that's where my first loss happened. In wvw. :'( I used to play wvw a LOT... and then everyone who I used to play with...all gone. Not just fellow wvw guildies, but everyone. They were bored. No updates. No rewards. I played with these people for a good 500 hours (and they were there before I even considered playing wvw). It was really depressing. I miss that "same people repeatedly and work together towards a common goal" mentality.
---
While we are at it, One wolf pack still doesn’t work properly on Conjugated Amalgam in W6. Great sword auto attack during the 3rd swing, if you dodge, it will sometimes do the dodge roll, but the evade frames do not actually go off. Axe 5 does not work on Octovine. These are just a few.
---
I specifically stated I dont know what your particular argument was about. I do think story is "balanced" by making it trivial rather than equal difficulty.
---
But populistic solutions to balance issues are very common here. Players providing "solutions" which are clearly flawed upon even slight examination in any direction. But they sound logical and appealing and relate to many users as long as they dont, so they get traction. The result? Misinformation, wasted resources and no ability for actual discussion.
---
I agree ideally story and performance across the game should be balanced. But it isnt, and its clear that anet intentionally avoids difficulty and balance here. Almost all story instances you can get achieves carried by other players no different than any other part of the game. But again, I'm all for balance across the game.
---
But just because someone has an opinion doesnt mean you should entertain them or that they have much useful to say. Many people will have opinions on the wall, whether they know anything about immigration or not. 
---
Likewise every player in this game has opinions on balance, many without being able to play more than one class, refusing to apply measurements to effectiveness or able to do basic math. 
---
If people were fair in terms of their knowledge or abilities itd be less of an issue, but they arent and the game dedicates itself to fooling people with little knowledge or ability into thinking they're great.
---
If someone states their optimize build uses soldiers armor I label them as idiots. If someone says 10% crit dmg equals a 10% dmg modifier I label them as idiots. If someone talks about increasing the base power damage and decreasing scaling then i label them as idiots. Its mean, but it means they dont have enough insight into the game to discuss balance on a meaningful level.
---
It's the same old ArenaNet song and dance: "We'll tell you what we want you to know, when we want you to know it, and in the meantime just play the game."
---
I do have to imagine that having all of their priorities re-aligned several months ago in the layoffs means that they have more devs to work on GW2 content, but ... what content?  
---
What are they dooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiing? What can we expect?
---
How long do we have to wait to find out how long we have to wait?
---
I hope you reported him.
---
Ultimately you’re right. I agree with you. The reward structure of the entire game should be overhauled. I wish it was, it’s not just raids let’s be honest. But it never will, that’s why magnetide shards are a thing and that’s why they’re *technically* valuable. They’re a substitute for a lack of rewards. Which coincidentally isn’t raw gold.
---
It was less about “getting burned out” and more about the fact that a lot of the content back then was temporary content that would be removed shortly after.
---
Thanks
---
Support Renegade for fractal and raids if you can find a quickness firebrand
---
Hi can I just ask, how does this middleman arrangement work? How does including him make everything safer? I don’t see any “how it works” rules in that subreddit. Thanks in advance!
---
&gt; won’t be banned if buyer sends me RMT gold
---
Impossible. If I use RMT gold to buy it from you, and Anet realizes I've used RMT gold, you're hosed.
---
I just love this meme.
---
It Always makes me smile.
---
I took the same screenshot. When that cutscene started I had my hand over the print screen button, grabbed a couple. The end of this episode had me as ecstatic as the beginning.
---
I've seen a lot of GM Binder and Homebrewery links for 5e content. I was just curious if anyone had compiled them all to one place. Maybe start a Guildwars Tabletop community to start, might be a cool idea
---
ask for payment in mystic coins
---
What makes it worse is that I'll sometimes get bugged out of the gold armors randomly (not from idling), and have to settle for a blue one that *might* be there, or I'll just have to avoid until burn/inevitable panic.

&gt; Raids being rewarding? The time it takes to learn a boss or hell, even to kill the boss, is better spent in silverwastes. 
---
I think he's talking not about the loot, but the experience. (and not XP, either) That it is fun, and enjoyable, and after you succeed, you can feel like you've done something.
---
I thought people played MMORPGs specifically because it was a completely garbage experience until the very end when you actually get to do stuff because the payoff is satisfying?
---
Or have we gone back to pretending they don't all follow the same formula now that there are only a few popular ones left out of the sea of them we used to be flooded with?
---
Don't pretend like people in GW2 don't consume stacks of exp scrolls and level 80 boosts like they're candy so they can skip everything and get to what they want to do.
---
In EVE players create content not the devs. The devs provide the tools for players to create content.
---
Many of the larger guilds of my server died long ago. Those were the guys who ran WvW and world events.
---
Arguing that it's somehow "mean" or "cruel" to criticize Anet is pointless and only hurts your experience with this game in the long term. How do you think management gets results from developers and artists? It's not with a kind hand on the shoulder. No, they do it with the understood threat of having no financial security. They tell their teams what they did wrong, and tell them to fix it, because they're paying for their life. That's the system. And that's how consumers get businesses back in line when they try to take advantage of their defensive, squishy customer base, like Anet does with false promises, fictitious timelines, unnecessary "balance" updates and gem store crap that requires more and more real world cash than actual game play to get. To reiterate, bitching at players who ask for better from this game has no point other than to give you someone to fight, which can be done in PvP or WvWvW. Help keep Anet accountable!
---
People are upset about the lack of direction and content, and doing the same things over and over. The subreddit does not need to be like that too with the *exact same posts* posted over and over again. Especially ones that appear to be taking credit for something they didn't do.
---
I'm sorry I enjoyed wvw and pvp. Now you can tell me that there has never been fair criticism and only negativity surrounding wvw and pvp, yet every thread from before HoT to long past PoF would get carebears going "pvp too toxic" "never happy" "delete from the game" and similar. 
---
Remember desert bl? Criticism along the lines of desert bl lagging out every two hours, being able to bug outside of the map and into almost every objective in the map were all shot down and buried. Meanwhile "the map was really pretty and a breath of fresh air". True, no doubt, but still the criticism was very valid and proved an issue for years. Still less popular than desert across virtually every matchup on EU and NA.
---
I'm not going around pretending I'm friendly. In fact I posed a few years ago that toxicity towards casuals is likely required to temporarily be able to play any other way than hardcore casual in wvw. I dont enjoy this fact, but I do think its true. 
---
I think the self proclaimed "friendly" casuals who "just want anyone to play how they like" often demand the exact opposite. And for the minority of vets to play bow they enjoy, they are FORCED to be the toxic elitists or plain not allowed to play the game as they enjoy. Asking for LI or experience or decent performance, banning classes and trying to be unappealing to the generic casual player is required to play wvw or raids at a more serious level. Do these players ENJOY hating on pve scrubs? No, not initially. They just sooner or later realise there is no other way, while also becoming bitter. Far from surprising. 
---
Who is then hypocrite? Both sides. Who holds power and responsibility? Guess it's the veterans if its negative, like wvw or raids not being accessible or inviting enough! For everything else, from resources to being the friendliest its casuals who this entire game must be made for!
---
First things first, great job on the layout of the pages. Looks very neat and tidy, without too much bloating of information while still retaining a professional feel to it. A few pointers I caught while reading:  
---
I feel like Cycles could make for a good Subrace option, rather than being simply flavor, in the case of sylvari. Retaining Charisma as the +2 Ability, it could go through Wisdom, Constitution, Intelligence and Dexterity respectively for Dawn, Noon, Dusk and Night. It might help give the sylvari some more versatility mechanics-wise, which somewhat harkens back to ANet's idea of "Every race can be effective as any class" while still retaining some flavor typical of DnD.
---
***Living Sap*** recharging "At dawn" is terminology not found elsewhere in 5th edition. It should be "Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest." to avoid ambiguity (Otherwise the party might just finish a fight against a banshee at 3am, then dawn comes and the sylvari player argues that his healing should recharge immediately, and he'd be technically correct.)  
---
However, I feel like Sylvari's regeneration isn't all that fast. "Directly after combat" would mean that, lore-wise, it kicks in after just a minute or two when I figure it'd at least take a few hours. Perhaps it should give a bonus to healing equal to a set number whenever they roll Hit Dice to restore hit points (Aka whenever you take a short rest)?  
---
Third, I feel like the spellcasting ability for ***Heart of Thorns*** could be Charisma rather than Wisdom, given the root (pun intended) of their innate abilities. Wisdom suggests it's their bond to nature and the dream, while Charisma would suggest it's something racial, stemming (another pun) from their sense of self. Given that Sylvari can use these abilities regardless of whether they're dreamers, soundless or nightmare I feel like Charisma might be the more fitting choice in this matter.
---
A Campaign (or multiple) set in Tyria with all guild wars themed content would be amazing tbh. For this though I just needed a good plant race to play for my next character
---
The same people once against raids, because they were exclusionary, is today against difficulty modes, because they're a waste of time.
---
It's all excuses, the only thing they want is to shill ArenaNet.
---
Unique subclasses too. A Golemancer subclass for Artificer thats exclusive to Asura. Maybe something Olmakhan related for Druid or Warlock. Things like that
---
Amen there. I will never get tired of repeating it, fanboys of this community are this game's true cancer. Not lootboxes, not incompetent management. The fucking fanboys.
---
I'm still on the subreddit even if I left the game months ago. I left because I felt like Andy thrashed on my way of having fun in the game one time too much. I used to play in raids, but I still come back because of the story from a few days then bye.
---
One thing that made me leave (that got better in the end) was the skill updates. Very often, skills got fucked in PvE because of something that got nerfed for PvP, or WvW. I think this help  your last point where people lack empathy towards people playing an other mode. It could even create hate towards them.
---
One thing that I liked though is that you aren't forced to play a game mode you don't like.
---
Nice try Anet
---
New content in this game revolves around morons crying about loot boxes and making fun of them, as though actual gamers give a shit about that issue lol.
---
South one burns, and then goes to west for their second and final burn. Its not rocket science. You say this is impossible yet it happens perfectly nearly everytime south one burns, which leads me to believe you don't have enough experience with the meta.
---
2 spots but heal fb AND they have more dps then chrono/druid + uber brain deadness like chrono was a srsly hard class compared to just pressing F4 on a renegade or spamming all your tomes as a firebrand
---
Wow, now imagine how the raid community feels sometimes if they wanna give others a hand.
---
"it's just a game bra, gosh I hate ya elitists toxic players"
---
You are being a bit pedantic and kind of missing the whole point.
---
No offense but if the fact of the matter is I'm right and if you disagree thats you betraying your own ignorance.
---
I don't think it's that valued, this game pretty much doesn't exist outside this subreddit.
---
killed wurm like 300 times with your comms. let me say thank you for your work TTT.
---
Yeah thats the point!
---
If you run a [proper aRene build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vlAQNAscmnXNWMTqJvmR/kZzsgytZ4QZ3MYr8bmFNl6/HPymsdACgGgdMOj3A-jRSBQB4RDTf1HQJ1fIy+DT8UAEYlfA4AKIYlgG7JFEA4A48m38zz8zP/8nf+5nf+5d95nf+5nf+5nf+5lCY3lRA-e) you provide your DDs with many quality of life boons like permanent protection and lots of stability. Jalis ["Inspiring Reinforcement"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inspiring_Reinforcement) street lines up perfectly with many cooldowns from bosses, you can mitigate Skorvalds Shard Adds and his knockback phase below 33%, at Artsariiv you can dupe all shockwaves across the platform and her explosions etc.
---
All of that makes running Fractals extremely efficient!
---
Also Renegades don't work with power. At all. In best cases you deal like 25k dps burst, compare that to Weaver / Soulbeast / Dragonhunter burst (100k+) and can maintain about 10k dps overtime.
---
Now think about how much you gain in dps and how much you loose in support, its not worth it - especially in 5man content!
---
Compliment those Renegades with a [proper Healbrand build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAW3ensADFBjNCDmBBkCjlHCDLA0A+A7zz7ZAN79MfyAA-jRSBQBT8iAYsDogCV/JL7PovnAobIlKBBwBKQjK/wjGm1BIAf9r51etEkgEkgv+1v+1v+1GgX/6X/6X/6X/6X/apA8bmF-e) and you can /brainafk 100CM.
---
You see you don't need to copy those builds.
---
I am farming Fractals for Years now.
---
In the beginning I played dgh DD and was frustrated at garbage druids who can't heal for shit since they're more of a boonsupporter than a proper healer. Early 2019 when Firebrigade started to gain tracktion and was a kinda hidden memebuild amongst others we tested a lot with different equipment and shit, I playtested Harrier Healbrand and soon figured that in scripted PvE content like raids its more reliable than in Fractals with its random affixes. So we went for Memestrel from WvW and that was a huge quality of life increase!
---
As the "real" Firebrigade was invented and everyone switched to Renegade healer I soon figured that juggling Jalis/Ventari/Kalla is a nightmare and fucking sucks tbh, you rely on your Quickbrand to work as a Team - so we went back to Healbrand and Alacrene since they work for themselfes, independently from outside forces so that makes them incredibly reliable.
---
As 5x dps compositions came around we dipped in there to see whats going on but holy shit do you need to play clean to pull them of, huge defecites to smooth gameplay...
---
Memestrel Healbrand can adapt his build to match everything and can provide all necessary boons.
---
Diviner Alacrene can adapt his build without struggling choosing stances and can fill gaps a Healbrand leaves.
---
Put both together you get a backbone of a group that can carry so hard since teammates can facetank mechanics and fail without getting punished for it.
---
Just sprinkle some proper dps builds and maybe a Bannerslave who pulls his thumb out of his arse and goes Spellbreaker and you can Netflix and chill through Fractal CMs.
---
Currently I'm going for the path that grants me the most stressfree experience!
---
If you farm Fractals for Days, Weeks, Months, Years you will figure that running dailys with 5x dps and the hassle that goes along with that is not worth it!

"Sylvari" isn't how you spell "choya" though. :O
---
I don't know why there isnt a "toy mounts" skin line, I feel it would sell quite well in wintersday.

---
That is what they were going for.  I'm not sure why.  Karma's a whore.
---
Yes some people like it. Many people expressed their strong dislike of it and pointed out key issues it would cause. Roaming in particular has changed as a result and some are mad. 
---
There's no good way to say if the change was positive or negative. It does make the bar to entry into WvW a bit higher than before. WvW activity numbers have fallen for off-peak timezones and peak times don't seem to have changed trajectory. 
---
It can be argued that the dropping numbers are due to balance and general burn out and not due to the mount. At the very least mounts did not revitalize the population as most experienced WvW players pointed out. 
---
On paper the trade off is more accessible travel at the expense of some roamers and the new player experience. And probably a boat load of cash from mount skins.
---
I consider Dragon Bash new content. It hasn't been around for a while, and they moved locations for it. And added new stuff to it. So.
---
Theres a difference between all story players grasp balance, no story players grasp balance and some story players grasp balance. 
---
You lead to the last paragraph by deciding you had to take my anecdotal experience as word for everyone including yourself AND felt offended.
---
You shared your anecdotal experience about wvw and pvpers being awful yet dont find your attitude problematic. You dont even disclaim.
---
Other people have to be nuanced and careful no to hurt your feels while you yourself make broad statements and demand you can share your opinions. You dish out anecdotal experience but cant tale it. Pretty textbook carebear if you ask me.
---
I've done the meta 40 times (literally, there's an achieve that counts it). And i have never seen this done in an effective way. 
---
So what if east or north fall behind? All octovines reset, because south can't run to north that easily.   
---
Why would you ever stick to a strategy without considering any change in circumstance? That's just plain stupid. You wouldn't stick to core warrior just because your personal dps is a bit higher in theory, even though the boss has 100% protection uptime. 
---
Also, what's the bloody point in running a risky af strat in that event? You get to your loot about 2 minutes earlier, so that you can wait longer for the next meta.
---
 hi can anyone help me to find some great reshade 4.0 presets? many of the presets in the woodenpotato post are all for version 3.0 which I don't know why doesn't work \^\^
---
Wish it was infinite as well. Pointless to make it limited.
---
Same for me..
---
Better to start pressing more than 1 on octovine after every person with decent build would quit...
---
And casuals definitely do not tag up for your hero point train.
---
I was led to believe the reason they don’t support because the event uses some 3rd party adon if I’m correct. Which they can’t endorse using. Why they can’t idk but they can’t.
---
Yup the developers of this game who actually made this shot are fantastic.  OP pressed one button in a predetermined area with a predetermined scenic look at the end and uploaded it claiming they made it like a bundle of sticks.
---
I get the impression you haven't really been understanding my points but now you're bringing it into some weird online psychology thing, so gonna bow out.
---
Anet did actually kind of fuck up. They introduced raids, which made "more invested" players that the game would actually provide content for them. But for whatever reasons, Anet went with the shittiest implementation possible: low-priority release cadence of one-size-fits-all that alienated and excluded the already established casual crowd and did nothing to challenge or engage the raiding crowd.
---
With one bad decision, Anet managed to cheese off two different kind of players. And kept sticking to that decision ever since.
---
Now, after years of neglect, they finally fuck off, but not before becoming unbelievably toxic shits.
---
Keep in mind that this "exodus" is just a bunch of extremely loud social media whiners. Their numbers won't make a dent.
---
Tbh I really like what Anet is doing at this moment, events events events. And they are participating them as well (maybe not the most professional gw players but who cares, its fun)
---
And in the meantime they are currently busy with a completely new story in the background. Atm there is soo much to do, and to me this next festival comes really quick you litterly cant rest at this moment. 
---
Its just how you look at this and how you like to play this game.
---
Oh man, the irony here is hilarious.
---
First time I watch one of these, I legit enjoyed it, specially the part with the WvW herald streamer lol.
---
[It also has a free trial.](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnJF1QtctLHf1CM/giphy.gif)
---
Thank you so much for your help!
---
There's a lot of stuff that could have been good if done right...
---
Exactly. I beat lvl 25, so why do I have to do extra stuff to start level 26?
---
It's always nice when it happens :D gotta love the new players that keep their chat tab closed...while not knowing what to do.
---
Can someone link me to where they promised communication. I keep seeing people say this but I can't find a source anywhere
---
I agree with others, you didnt do anything special. And you sound like you did... There is no reason why you should be proud of this. Its not even that you choose good moment for screenshot that other people did not think of. Lots of other people did a screenshot in this same moment, including me. You should actually feel bad because you didnt think about this before making this pointless thread my friend.  Yes.. you failed hard here. You can still save your face by changing the title like others suggested.
---
thanks to you guys i managed to get all 3 armors completed :D
---
Killing frogs and breachers is not Armor's job. Their dps is rather mediocre, but they are valuable for strong cc and unique condition. The best way is to focus on breaking the defiance bars as a priority.
---
from some automated system: probably. nothing the support can't fix.  
---
if i remember right, people get unbanned if they are the victim and just the items get removed from your account.  
---
if its a high value item, i wouldn't be suprised if the support sends back your high value item...could be that you would need to escalate the ticket tho to a higher up until that happens.  
---
those situations are pretty rare, so probably no one can tell you 100% if it always go that way.  
---
maybe /u/Dornsinger can answer you this question, if there is such a high value item in question that you can't sell it over TP since there is a limit of 10k and its worth more on the market.

---
&gt;Grandmaster crafters have put their heads together to come up with something new and convenient: legendary runes and sigils for your equipment!
---
&gt;### How Legendary Upgrades Work
---
&gt;Once socketed, a legendary upgrade has the power to take on the properties of any other upgrade of its type. You can freely socket and remove them from any type of armor without using an Upgrade Extractor. Unlike other legendary items, legendary upgrades have no visual effects.
---
&gt;Legendary runes provide the same set bonuses as other runes, and you can combine them with exotic superior runes. For example, if you have a Superior Rune of the Adventurer in your helm, and you add a legendary rune to your boots, setting the legendary rune’s suffix to Adventurer will grant the two-piece bonus for that set.
---
&gt;### How to Obtain Them
---
&gt;Like other legendary items, legendary upgrades are acquired using the Mystic Forge. You’ll need to provide several gifts, including one that requires new materials unlocked by a global event.
---
&gt;On July 30, citizens will be called on to trade in their piles of lucent crystals to crafting discipline grandmasters in exchange for Satchels of Loot, with the goal of forcing the knowledge out of the Mystic Forge. Every donation progresses a global community goal. Once the goal is complete, the ability to create new materials for legendary upgrades will become available to every discipline that can craft upgrades.
---
&gt;Grandmaster Craftsman Hobbs will steer you in the right direction. Happy crafting!
---
&gt;

---
Getting paid for being trusted. I want in. It's free ~~realstate~~ money.
---
Never going to happen. Anet that was capable of getting job done died in 2012-2013. Nighfall campaign took less time to make than latest episode of living story. That speaks volumes by itself about studio. 
---
The thing is that actual playerbase are not about constant stream of new content (that should be done by default). They want guild system revamp, they want endgame content updated as well, they want expansion 3, they wany build templates, they want WvW rewamp, they want new PvP maps. None of that was delivered by Anet in any reasonable timeframe.
---
The main reason I don't read your storyboard posts anymore is because they're too difficult for me to read as fan-fiction.  When I read them I end up pining over what could have been, and that's too much of a depression rabbit hole for me to jump into at this point.  It's been about a month since I've played GW2 in earnest.  The memory of playing is more of a nostalgia factor than anything else; I'd just casually idle in Twinspur Haven in Wayfarer Hills and watch the snow fall.
---
I always get the two mixed up and can never remember which is which for the expansions...
---
Okay all good things to know, thank you so much! Sounds like the GW2 Wiki page is pretty useful, so I'll have to check it out a bit more! Thank you so much for taking the time to help me out!
---
Honestly you guys have your panties pulled up to your brains. Its just a nice picture.
---
Besides those paid things you put into homeinstance and they deliever to you on a daily basis
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.
---
Chairs and Legendary runes - What thrilling endgame content...
---
well it is kinda unnecessary to be honest
---
You won't swap runes so often unless you have legendary armor too so can swap stats too, but then you can swap them anyway so you just get few inv spaces.
---
Having to scroll a minute thru the options to choose the one I want instead of selecting the name. Great UX. Tell me more.
---
Sounds like the pile of lucent crystals are likely to be as useful as mithril, back in the last 'global hand-in'.
---
Wouldn't go spending gold on those.. don't feed the people who just bought 200k off the market.
---
Yeah someone else brought up that the Cycles could function as subraces, which I think is a good idea. Am probably gonna go back and fiddle with that.
---
I wonder, what would happen if players did a strike and didn't contribute for the global event. Not hitting even the first tier. Then the content won't be delivered?
---
It's the heroic spread legs, tits out, thot-back stance of GW1:  
---
https://i.imgur.com/lBCI5Mp.jpg
---
Just looking at it makes my back hurt.
---
WvW players use a lot of other runes too. And condi build in PVE with legendary armours
---
Norn could follow the roots of the barbarian options. Finding something close to each boost from the animals, and give the norn something like that. Or, if shifters exist, combine the two. My ability to look this stuff up is limited right now.     
---
Bear gets +1 con and extra HP     
---
Wolf gets advantage once a day or fight      
---
Panther gets +1 dex and jumps further/can jump as a bonus action    
---
Owl gets dark vision and +1 wis
---
&gt;Unlike other legendary items, legendary upgrades have no visual effects. 
---
HALLELUJAH!
---
As to the function: Kind of predicted it would be this way. Though I'm confused about one bit: 
---
&gt; Once socketed, a legendary upgrade has the power to take on the properties of any other upgrade **of its type.** 
---
How do they define "of its type"? I'd imagine of its primary (slot 1/3/5) stat, but the preview image has of the Citadel (Power) and of the Defender (Toughness).
---
I'm interested in seeing it when you're done.
---
&gt; https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades
---
You need gift of upgrades.
---
Right now at current prices a single rune is more than 1k gold.
---
so you need  6 of them or whats the point?
---
While certaintly Anet wasted quite some funds in side projects that could have gone on focus on GW2 better, we have to say that FFXIV is a P2P game...xpacs + 12-13 euros or whatever each month for every single active player is a lot...probably more than what GW2 does with it's optional cash store...  
---
A P2P game (when honestly supported by the devs ofc) will ALWAYS have a higher output of content compared to a B2P. Especially if we see them having a close amount of active players. The money income is just higher and steadier. I know a lot of people that never spent a dime on GW2 beside beside the xpacs, while in FFXIV just to play you need to pay 140+euros yearly + any xpacs releasing...and let's not forget that even while P2P, those games still have an in-game store.   
---
About ESO i'm not sure, still...it's a given that if you're a dedicated player you will spend quite a bit for the content you're given...since either you pay the ESOplus monthly to have access to all the DLCs (but still have to pay for the xpacs 40-60 bucks) or spend something like 200ish for everything...don't remember the exact amount...should be around 130 bucks + 90 or so for the xpacs that you can't buy with crowns.   
---
Also do not know how much content is delivered compared to GW2, but i hope more...since playing cost quite some bucks.
---
1k gold each? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades
---
&gt; How do they define "of its type"?
---
Since they talk about runes and sigils, I presume that a legendary rune can become any rune, and a legendary sigil can become any sigil. :P
---
A search function would be nice. Scrolling through hundred runes doesn't look convenient.
---
That'd be too limiting. Ideally, a player would need 6 of these per character (7 if they want to maximize optimability but lulz underwater combat). So a single character should be reasonably able to make 6 of these.
---
Since we already have 20 legendaries requiring an item any character can only ever get 2 out of, I'd guess we'll see some crafted gifts throughout instead.
---
One gift, however, is likely to be this: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift\_of\_Upgrades](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades)
---
Well.. having to go to the wiki to figure out the stats of each rune would probably take even longer.
---
Looks like I won!
---
I'll be getting these for cutting down on the number of runes and sigils in my inventory. On my thief alone for PvE I have pack, scholar, krait, afflicted, durability, leadership and monk runes off the top of my head. Probably some other niche things. That doesn't include runes for WvW either and I probably have an even greater number of sigils.
---
Less space being used in my inventory by gear is always welcome. It will also cut down on the number of ascended weapons I have that have the same stats but different sigils so that's nice. It is definitely a luxury - like all legendary gear - but it will be good to have.
---
I really love this effect too
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades
---
At current prices it's 1k gold per rune.
---
I for one also loath this skill stuck in a loop. It doesn't go away unless you swap map, or re-load into the same map by logging out and back in again.
---
glad i saved them since the beginning, it's payout time!
---
Do you want the animation to be removed completely from the game? Because this is how you make it happen. RIP female human strech animation.
---
There are millions of them on the TP at an incredibly low price. I don't think there's going to be a huge spike there. Charms, though, have probably already spiked.
---
This particular instance of it persisted into the "wounded" (whatever the name is) transformation for the end of the LS4 e5 instance, where you can't dodge, pull a weapon, open your inventory or even use your chat box for the ~5 minute crawl to the end &gt;&lt;
---
I realized that literally as I got the notification of your post, due to another comment.
---
For some reason, my mind blanked out on the existence of sigils and I was only ever thinking runes.
---
who cares? it's a community event, which means once unlocked, everyone can use it. So whatever. Just let the whales buy everything and do it for you. 10/10
---
If it costs more than an endless bank access it would prob be ignored by many people... Cause everyone I know swaps gear sets and not swap runes unless they do build craft.
---
What do you use durability and leadership in pve for? Pack and monk for boon/heal thief, scholar dps, krait+afflicted condi.
---
sure,but you dont need to swap them XD . i have almost all leg weapons and i have *NEVER* swaped stats from berz,runes from scholar,sigils from +5% dmg. i doubt that someone is so crazy to change stats and runes in pve/wvw. (last 5 roamers gona downvote)
---
Certainly not necessary, but it's been in demand since legendary armor, so....
---
The colors are amazing!
---
&gt; if crafting 6 Legendary runes costs more than 300g, it's worthless.
---
Honestly, I think will cost more than 200g per rune not for all six.
---
That interface seems to miss a search bar.
---
That's what I think too, 300g was just to explain the "better case, and even tho, not profitable".
---
So maybe don't take credit for this nice picture when you didn't "make" it
---
They said "several" gifts and new materials that will unlock after the donation event. So it sounds like a lot more than just this one gift.
---
If it is one gift for one rune then that is going to be way overpriced. One Gift of Upgrades with some other Gifts for a set of 6 runes and 2 sigils for a total cost similar to a gen 2 legendary seems more reasonable.
---
There's about 100 different runes, have fun scrolling through them all when only 2 and a half fit on screen at a time.
---
You are probably right https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades  
---
This was uncovered a while ago accidentally, and will be a pretty penny to make.
---
Runes, Sigils, Jewels, perhaps Infusions (either both or +stat ones) and least possible it'll include Glyphs
---
The kinds are defined in [upgrade component](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upgrade_component) article
---
Damn, that's a lotta gold.
---
I can't believe people keep falling for this. They're just sucking materials out of the economy and giving you near-worthless stuff back.
---
They're gonna release this whether people donate stuff or not.
---
at that price why not just buy permanent extractor lol
---
Thank you! I didn't even know how to start searching for it.
---
They put their heads together to steal your hard earned gold thats what they did.
---
If they just make you get something that helps you crafting one of those runes if you participate throurough it would be the best incentive.
---
If I *took* a photo with my phone, I would say I took the photo. Not made it. *Making* something implies that you "cause (something) to exist or come about; bring about ". You didn't cause it. You were there to appreciate it, and took a snapshot of it.
---
Tbh when I first read your title I expected you had drawn it or edited it to look nicer or something, as that's what it implies.
---
Horribly explained system too tbh
---
Might be because all the whining on reddit witch forced them to rush it out as it’s really not that big of a deal anyway. Yet, people are still so pissy about this. Quality, quantity, fast. Pick 2. Do people still not know this?
---
plz someone tell me it will be a passive effect for legendaries already.........!?  
---
there is no logical reason for that
---
They don't need to cheat it. They know what the supply of the material is and they have metrics on how the players behave. With a little math they can predict the outcome with near 100% certainty.
---
I liked the first two (?) world boss events, as they were reasonably paced, also completely new and refreshing. The recent one was brought back too soon imo.
---
Like if only there was a single game without bugs ever. Definitely PoE is way better than 90% of AAA games released, bugs wise.
---
Lucent more price jumped x5 in 30minutes
---
Don't see much of a point to these.  Rarely do you use 2 different on the same stat set which makes these pretty niche outside of being used with legendary armor.  But, if you have legendary armor, it's more convenient and a hell of a lot cheaper to just get the runes you need for your character.  Even if it's 6+ runes that's 6 bag slots.  Much cheaper to just get a 32 slot bag for or even convert gems to gold to get a bag slot expansion.
---
I see the usefulness in legendary armor, trinkets and weapons but this just seems a bit useless to me :shrug:
---
Right? Lol
---
I don’t think I understand... aside from the ability to move them around without upgrade extractors what else is changing?
---
yeah I watched that one go up to only 6 available (or 6 shown anyway) at 5g a piece before people started undercutting, but it's still way up.
---
&gt; the only tradeoff is a -slight- savings in cost and a -slight- savings in inventory or bank space.
---
Depending on char I have 3-15 different runes+sigils in my inventory, even more in the bank. You really understate with "slight" savings in inventory and bank.
---
Plus the fact that you don't need legendary gear anymore (or buy tons of runes/extractors) if you want to test/play around with runes/sigils.
---
However, there biggest benefit is still (and ever was with legendary stuff) the QoL aspect.
---
That would be hilarious actually, given the speculators throwing money at stuff right now.
---
I can't wait to scroll through a huge ass list of runes/sigils+weapons, armor and trinket stats whenever I want to change build.
---
Thank god for arcdps, instead or buying gems for char slots I'll just donate some money to him because he deserves it more.
---
Finally here, at a ludicrous price of 1-2k per upgrade slot...
---
Yikes, thats like [600 gold](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-89218) at current prices just for this single gift per rune.
---
A whole stack of each charm or symbol per rune or sigil is a bit excessive,
---
especially at the current drop rates.
---
The rotation and the initiative gestion look... difficult.
---
Make a post on gw2exchange you want to sell it and go from there. Chances are high a high rep guy will buy it. In this case not even middle man is needed and further you are save from rmt problems. If a non rep buyer wants it check the sub if he is known for false traiding and if not ask for a middleman and do the trade.
---
Yea... 1 expansion, 2 new warframes, new prime, new story quest, new player experience. All in 2019. While I do not even know if GW2 LWS5E1 would ever go live...
---
It's legendary, they're gonna cost hundreds of times what exotics would to do the same thing.
---
I never sold charms or symbols since I have the Runecrafters o matic and I bought it immediately after release. I would say I play much and only have 30-50 of each.
---
and you'll have to get them 6 times each
---
To be fair wing 7 was suppose to release with episode 6, but got delayed. Vision, was never previously mentioned, though people suspected it was coming so that’s fair.
---
I like the scroll option. I think this new interface will be dope.
---
Sometimes it's a client-side thing and ranger is even not aware it runs with it; there's also a variation of this bug - eagle is visible only over some textures or skill effects
---
I hope so. It will give all of the whiners on this sub something to do.
---
Being present to press a button to *take a picture* is not making anything. There was no effort to "cause (something) to exist or come about; bring about". I just feel its doing a disservice to the people who put actual time and effort into making art, and to the dev's who put in the work to craft this scene. Not to mention we don't need the same recycled posts all the time. We all play this game. Guaranteed most people have seen this scene already.
---
Must be fun having to run back constantly to get in range.
---
Why would people need to go to the wiki? A lot of people know what runes they want to use.
---
I have no interest in legendary Runes. Legendary Sigils are what interest me.
---
I'm glad you didn't put the meta event rush in there, I really enjoyed that one
---
People complain about 30 minute food and want to stack it up to 2 hours or so. And now people complain about a 24h buff and want it to be endless. People are strange. 
---
I mean it's not that hard to visit the guild hall every few days. It isn't more effort that going to your bank and take another exp booster.
---
maybe he decides to quit that middleman thing and make some cash before.
---
if you wanna sell items there, do it, but dont complain when you get scammed
---
&gt; Do you think people who invest at most 5h per week will remember all the names?
---
I don't expect people playing 5hr a week to ever be able to afford a full set of legendary sigils.
---
Hi, since you asked, I'm going to say this is bad, too. I hate how GW2 locks quality of life features behind huge grinds and/or cash shop. Inventory management is miserable in GW2 and I end up spending so much time doing it that sometimes I decide to come back to GW2, launch it, look at my inventory, quit and play something else.
---
That you only need a single set instead of X sets?
---
play a real build 4head
---
They don't have an end date, so I just assume that means the event will run until it succeeds.
---
&gt; A whole stack of each charm or symbol per rune or sigil is a bit excessive, especially at the current drop rates
---
Very true. Even if you use a rune crafters kit on everything that drops its still a slow process to get all the symbols and charms from normalish play.
---
the tp limit should be just higher.. 
---
ironically, all the PoE community wants is a TP, because the direct trade sucks ass
---
Still not balance, just trying to un-fuck what they've fucked with LS episode, which ironically made it even worse.
---
Make them? I would assume the legendary sigils just come with the option of everything.
---
&gt; Jessica Price said something along the lines of Anet didn't know if season 4 will be the end of the game.
---
Honestly Anet so lazy and do not care, that they even do not sue her for clear NDA breakage.
---
You might get something wrong, I never was "fake nice" or nice at all, I told him to leave. 
---
If you say it's passive aggressive only because I don't throw around stupid insults, then you got something wrong. Reddit has it's rules, I just follow them. It has nothing to do with being "nice".
---
Sure, if you are following a guide or just use runes you used before. But if you wanna change to something new it is very unlikely that you know every single bonus of every single rune set in the game.
---
Not if it's censored. :o
---
Good thing they are both available then
---
We need three things to happen. 
---
Us veterans to stop shitting at casuals and blaming them for ruining fun
---
Casuals to get to know at least basics of the game
---
Anet to see both veterans and casuals as equally important targets - even if there's fewer of us, we are the glue that holds the game together.
---
Too bad, it took me 5 minutes to write this comment. :/
---
Neat.
---
There's not much pushing me to acquire different runes on my characters. Certainty not enough to justify sinking a bunch of gold into a single character.
---
Pushing this change before native build templates seems out of order... This seems like heavy burden for DeltaConnected to support in arc.
---
A simple search bar would've solved it...
---
I fully support this :D
---
Where's the dragonbash new content? I can't seem to find it.

He doesn't really say he's made anything. Just states the fact of "Best screenshot I've taken". This is a fact, he did take/make a screenshot. Not sure why people are reacting so negatively to a guy sharing his enthusiasm for the game.
---
yeah, i know there were a couple new things and new rewards (dialogue isn't content)
---
GAEM DEAD NO CONTENT WHY ADD NEW THINGS WE WANT OLD THINGS
---
Do the dailies. It takes 15 minutes on most days.
---
They have great hearing and smell. Also, sound doesnt magically travel through walls without slowing down considerablly. So. Line of sight.
---
Per character, per armor set...unless you want to swap them around all the time.
---
Might be a goal worth getting now that it diesnt effect my looks
---
More than 650 gold per piece with current prices.

Shut the fuck up you mentally ill person.

Have you read the title?

"Best screenshot i've made (season 4 last ep)"
---
# made

Legendary armor is about 2k gold, and perma extractor is like 2.6k. I think you could expect legendary upgrades to be on the order of 1-2k for a set, not 4-5k.
---
Good player...with decent ping and fast reaction time. Thing is: Kitty doesn't count as really good player, she has spiky overseas ping and she's a slow thinker. Gotta nab like dem nabs do if you can't help but nab.
---
First finishing finals^^
---
After that I continue working on it.
---
Most of the fluff stuff is probably just paraphrased from the PHB but races, professions, creatures, enchantments and leveling will be unique and different to classic DnD so it will take a while.
---
How much of a casual or a bad player are you that you cant work towards a goal?
---
Lol
---
I'm thinking that this is outrageous even for a legendary, considering you need 6 of them.
---
I suspect that maybe...maaaaybe...that gift of upgrades might be to make some sort of Runeforge gobbler item that eats lucent crystals to make some intermediate item.
---
Then you throw that item in with other stuff in the forge to get the legendary rune itself.
---
How so? You can remove them freely and like all legendary items, they are account bound.
---
The recipe &amp; the item was in the game but they patched it very quickly.
---
This better be cheap. Max 50g/rune.
---
It's literally just a QoL feature. Something that would be better if it were just a baseline feature in the game.
---
I mean he did make this screenshot. Pressing print screen makes a screenshot. Make doesn't imply he is taking creative credit for it. Also he might not be a native English speaker for all we know.
---
I can hardly believe anyone would defend this atrocious interface design. This is a list fully populated with the complete tooltips for these upgrades—you know, the tooltips that are normally used to simplify interfaces by appearing as on-hover pop ups.
---
The alternative to this unwieldy mess is *not* players being forced to look up the details outside of game on wiki, or even being forced to manually click through the list one-by-one. The solution is to use these tooltips *as intended* as on-hover pop ups in a simplified list of icons and names. In fact, they already do this in the PvP Build panel. How is this not obvious?
---
I don't know if you're being obtuse or not, but there are ~80 superior runes in the game and people are assuming you'll have to scroll through a list of all 80 to pick the stats they want on a legendary one. six times per set.
---
Do not know what you are talking about, with current balancing pace I would use Minstrel/Durability FB in WvW for 2 years more.
---
Lol. Reddit is like 5% of the community. Yup that's definitely us who made them push unfinished (aka without a search bar) feature, we won folks.
---
Left are the pseudo-hardcores, which rather than playing and learn to benefit from the game's "imperfections", decide to whine; attempting to blame everyone else and their grandma over their own utter uselessness.
---
Agreed on the limit needing to be higher.
---
I always liked WoW's direct trading system but yeah, it can definitely suck sometimes.
---
Thats what they think, that person is an idiot. You don't have to be toxic about it and tell them to quit the game. You don't speak for the entire gw2 community, although you're similar to a lot of the toxic fake people I've encountered in game.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, I imagine this is going to be addressed with build templates... which will be paid for with gems of course beyond the free 1-2 templates they'll give out. For this hyper convenience of not having to scroll for every rune selection.
---
I think it has to do with people just really familiar with playing chrono/druid. I think most people at this point agree that FB/Ren is better, but chrono/druid has been meta for so fucking long that it will take a long time for players to move away from it.
---
Nothing but statselection? Seems useless if you got legendary armor. Runes/Sigils were never that expensive anyway. And then the foreseable goldsink. No, thx anet.
---
People who play games are absolutely terrible at coming up with solutions for problems in video games so no, it wouldn't.
---
when i do events i call them out specifically or target them if they are in the squad, usually the public shaming is enough to get them to stop, or at least more people start berating them for not listening.
---
@DyceFreak, probably something for the Anti TS Guild ;)
---
Not everyone play with a single main character. 
---
Having to shuffle items around between characters is nothing but a horrid hassle. The more characters you have, the harder it is to remember who had what, and it keeps you from keeping quick customizations separately per character. 
---
And if the item can be transmuted, you can't keep an individual appearance per character, unless you spend inordinate amounts of transmutation charges and wate lots of time transmuting over and over and over.
---
And if the items are already account-bound, the more reason to let every character get their own copies of them, either for free or for a reduced cost.  
---
There could be a way to craft replicas of legendary items once the original has been bound to the account.  
---
For example, you'd craft Bolt, then you'd be able to use an ascended Sword to make a "Bolt Replica" that has "Replica" instead "Legendary" in the item description.  
---
You would not be able to get the Twice-Told legend achievement with a replica, but you would not have to waste time in the bank to use an item that is already account-bound with several characters. Each character could get their own. 
---
Imagine if you had to unlock the Hall of Monuments in a separate character in GW1 for each character in GW2 instead having the HoM rewards be account wide as they are now. 
---
Skins, dyes, minis, novelties, crafting recipes, all things that have become account wide were nothing but improvements. 
---
Account-wide unlocks are always better.
---
"So they i'm a monster and you are a hero"
---
You’re a manchild.
---
These recipes were all discovered in game before they were put on the wiki, so yes, they are discoverable in game.  But it’s a huge PITA to draw that picture for the first time on your own by looking at items in game... which is why there is a wiki to make the info easier to understand.
---
There is a difference between insults and opinions. 
---
People use the same argument as you did to insult people and say it's their "right of free expression". 
---
That's not how it works...
---
I've participated in two "global progress" events in this game, and both times they progressed at a uniform rate throughout the entire event, finishing perfectly just before the end.
---
You'd think the rate would be faster at the start and the end, or that the goal might not be reached, but that never happens.
---
Nope. They intentially make the process take time.
---
I rather believe it would not exist anymore.
---
Don't worry I think that's just because the issues in your head are fighting over dominance over your deranged mind.
---
The dragon bash event was a good way,  but yeah it's over now
---
lol, done it 70+ times and all you bring to the table in your textual excrement is a typical elitist view of gw. tarir is not hard. doing it without one burn is also not hard. If you have enough people and communicate tarir can always be done in a relatively short time.
---
Worse still when you realise it's just cycling the same years-old gemstore content in and out. Year in, year out. Zzzzzzz.
---
People are assuming that you'll see all the ones you haven't unlocked yet. They don't know that. It could just as easily be it shows you only the ones you've unlocked.
---
oh damn I hadn't even considered that, these are an easy pass at this price point (and it's only going to go up) because free swapping anyway, but if the free swapping becomes just a perk of leg runes/sigils I'll be livid, the QoL is the only reason I've worked on legy armor for so long (I dislike the aesthetics)
---
Farm them with alts
---
4 days late but maybe there is a kind soul out there who can help me out. I played gw2 for a few weeks at release but quit for several reasons, right now I have nothing to play until WoW classic and I need a small fix of mmo so turning my gaze towards gw1 and 2, already got my gw1 plan sorted out but need some help with gw2 since my knowledge here is far less than that of gw1.
---
Firstly, I only have the base game, is it worth getting the 2 xpacs even if I might not make it to max lvl? Any perks without going endgame in the xpacs for lvling and such?
---
Secondly, I played warrior at launch but feeling a caster this time, thinking of mesmer or necro, which of them do you guys prefer and why? I like dots and simple/relaxing gameplay if that helps.
---
And lastly, general tips/tricks/hints and things you wish you knew for a complete beginner that is good to know, thanks!
---
Oh, so they work with alts?
---
70 isnt a lot.
---
40 isnt a lot.
---
And the point is that a thing done right is done best.
---
E1: Farm meteors
---
E2: do the Metas, use your gathering tool and do the hearts
---
E3: the Meta over and over again. Use lfg to switch instance if 
---
E4: do the bubbles and hearts, if possible branded shatterer
---
E5: metas, gathering, heart
---
E6: metas for keys, keys for boxes, boxes for mats
---
And as always: pvp reward track gives u 50-60 mats, having some alts will increase your daily cap of gathering rapidly and most importantly u don’t have to do that all in one day. Neither the skyscale or vision will be patched out anytime soon. - Enjoy
---
Oh I'm sorry, I must have missed when Path of Fire and Heart Of Thorns were free on release.
---
All chapters except Sandswept Isles and Domain of Kourna give 25 of the currency per map completion. 
---
Along the ones bought from the hearts, gathering and events along the way, it can be done in less than 4 map completions.
---
For the Isles and Kourna it's faster to focus on the hearts, and joining the metas when they are up, without waiting around for them.
---
Because they suck at researching and looking things up and want to know if they have missed or overlooked the answer to their question. I read OP as having already looked for things on their own and is now just asking others to confirm thier what the currently know and if they have possibly missed the information else where.
---
Who said anything about coming up with solutions? Even getting them to acknowledge the problems and being able to point them into that direction would be amazing at this point.
---
LOL
---
I had no idea thats hilarious.
---
That's a nice rifle
---
Ranger is outlandishly broken..crippling leap from soul beast can be cast for a 600 dash every few seconds if you break the animation, soul beast mode can stack on druid and core ranger, pets can be stacked, if the above stated bugs arnt enough to say it; the dps and sustain is insane to godly levels in pve and wvw. These are just a few things, theres more interactions that break the game but I dont want to go to much in detail.
---
May be on to something here - I returned after a long hiatus and got a BL key from random drop and Zap not long after, seem to vaguely recall something similar happening last time I returned too. Probably just tinfoil hat theory but it would make sense for Anet to reward players coming back. :p
---
Correct
---
So your argument is a legendary rune that costs hundreds of gold will still not give you access to every rune stat block? That sounds like a great idea...
---
Can you check gw2 efficiency?
---
On the grand scale of things, no, you're right, but if that is the only thing you can reply to my comment, then i suppose you're lacking experience in discussing things properly, and bringing valid arguments rather than just "ur not as experienced as me". 
---
And 40 times definitely gives you some insight in how the meta works. If you've full cleared wing1-4 40 times you have over 400Li, and you wouldn't say he has no clue, now, would you?
---
Use taco with tekkit's guides
---
Wrong. Someone can have an opinion that can be construed as "insulting". For example, I think you're an idiot. That's my opinion. And it's meant as an insult as well. And back to the main point of what I was saying, it's the people like you who are toxic to the community as you encourage other players like the commenters above, and like me, to uninstall and leave. See how that works for Arenanet as more players quit this game over content drought and a divided community.
---
"Line of...hearing"?
---
LOL, look how the price of Lucent Crystals change from 96c to 4s+62c :D  
---

---
SPECULATION IS REAL
---
I like the comparison with path of exile, the arpg that doesn't change shit nearly anything in its formula (same final boss as it has been for one and a half years, every league has been a variation on kill more/marginally harder mobs with more and more screen wiping abilities) and it's praised as a great game compared to gw2 which actually has the devs keeping power creep under control and releasing new and interesting bosses (they might not be hard, but they at least are interesting and have cool mechanics)
---
Don't get me wrong, I *like* path of exile, but the disconnect between the content that people expect (people in r/pathofexile ask for fucking "no new content just fix old issues" seasons which is mind-blowing compared to what people ask for here) in different games is insane and I think totally unfair for anet.
---
You're gross
---
Well, as this update is essential to have before build templates, getting it already means that build templates are yet again one step closer.
---
Moderators there will act as middleman if you pay them for it. Those guys are as trustworthy as it gets.
---
Guild buffs are great little bonuses you can take advantage of for being in a guild. They are not must haves at all times. If you use them great you get that little bit extra, if not you are not getting set massively behind everyone else. If you are dead set on min/maxing what you can potentially get out of your play time perhaps check your guild enhancements with greater regularity so you can re-up them and not miss out.
---
Mmm nice, no more worries about "WTF am I going to do with all these lucent crystals?"
---
I told a friends about the recent changes to Engineer and he deleted his and opted to take a break from the game after testing it for himself. :/
---
You're still just being elitist, toxic and condescending, and no, you are not making a case.
---
Reading the rest of the thread made me realise what you want to accomplish by oneburning: panic the other sides. And that is arguably an ok tactic. (although only partially ok from a moral standpoint)
---
And that is what you could have bloody said and explained instead of repeating over and over that none of your commentors have any experience.   
---
You're not really trying to do the meta the best way possible, but to get other people to not afk and thus do the meta.
---
I have played octovine at least 10 times but I have neve figured out what to do or even what is happening. Most of the time it's successful, but I have never known why. I know you're gonna say to read up on it, sure I will some day, but it has always irritated me that it is not obvious what to do.
---
Yes, you can have multiple characters do the hearts in the same day. If I want to farm living world currency and can't wait, this is usually what I do. If you have the portal scrolls or tomes it's even easier to get multiple characters into each map.
---
If you go to trading post history tab and search item sold, do you see your legendary in there? Make sure to click  load more items until you can see the entire history
---
As a PvX'er, I have so much to do I can't find time to do all of it.
---
I was hoping for them to release ascended runes and sigills with the introduction of legendary ones. It feels strange to suddenly have legendary equivalents to exotic equipment.
---
I’ve been doing map completion on a reaper the last few days, and can 100% attest to this. 
---
“Ooh, an event!” 
---
*Ding - Heart Completed* 
---
“Good luck with that horde, you’ll be fine!”
---
As opposed to? Effort? All you have to do is throw stuff in the mystic forge presumably for these sigils. Time? Besides the first 4 leggy weapons the rest take minimal time to actually craft.
---
If you are decent at pvp, you can usually finish your daily completionist with 1 pvp match as long as you win. Also, LWS3 maps are great for ascended trinkets. Just gotta pick winterberries, mine some bloodstone crystals, do a few hearts. The LWS3 dailies. Whatever the current festival/event is if you have some spare time since it's usually something different to help you from getting burnt out.
---
Zoomed in shaky cam made me turn it off.
---
Hearts are repeatable with different characters. If you have 10 characters (for example) you can do each heart 10 times a day. This also works to a degree for gathering and events. I think some events are daily per account but I cant remember right now.
---
It might just be the same set of achievements. After the first event they mentioned that there would be other chances to get the achievements in the future. We have gotten a second event since then and we know there will be more weapons but this could just be part of the same series of events.
---
"anet should have communicated things" "but I'm gonna flame the shit out of them when it doesn't go my way, ignoring their explanation for why they stopped"
---
Excellent, I love it
---
Yes, I do have the tomes and all classes at 80 😊
---
Anyone I've ever heard having the same problem accidentally set a lower price than intended and made a really, really happy buyer. 
---
Can you see the History&gt;Sold in My Transactions in the trading panel? Was the price right?
---
If the price was right, there's a also the possibility that someone has access to your account and mailed the gold to themselves.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Just one more reason why Gen1 legendaries should have been account bound like Gen2.
---
Agreed. Throw in a - 5% flat damage nerf to Reaper.
---
I was looking forward to this update, but even more so to hearing about Anet's long-term plans. Just drop a "chill peeps, an expansion will be coming eventually, even if not soon" and many peeps should chill indeed.
---
Can't we at least wait until we know the actual cost before we start whining about it?
---
\&gt; 70 isn't a lot
---
70 \* (5 min/run + 7min looting and bosses + 10 min pre meta) = 11.8 h only doing tarir. By my standards that is quite a lot
---
Current prices are not reliable. Too much speculation. Also keep in mind this will also drive up the prices of all other runes and sigils that are obtained through crafting.
---
On the other hand that will also increase prices of salvagable upgrades so you can pay off the price of the perma extractor faster ...
---
then you should voice your opinion in one of the many posts that is discussing anets long term plans and not moan about it in a post about next weeks update.
---
What pants is that?
---
Octovine is pretty simple imo but there are metas that I spent some decent time on the wiki reading about them but I still have no clue what to do.
---
Besides trial and error there were also the item tooltips and just the rarity of the items. The most difficult one to discover was probably Gift of Fortune but maybe not since the clovers would have helped. On the other hand there was discovering the clover recipe in the first place.
---
&gt; Is there any way IN GAME to find the info I need, or am I really supposed to just go look it up?
---
No, you are supposed to travel the (game) world and figure it out.
---
this makes so much sense but it also hurts me how much work this is.
---
thanks for the explainer.
---
Great response, thanks a ton!
---
&gt;But even despite that, the raids are good, they are high quality, they  are genuinely difficult, genuinely rewarding and have great  replayability.
---
Im sorry, but no. Just no. Replayability is SERIOUSLY hampered by the weekly timegate, made even worse just a few patches ago when they even removed champ bags from repeating raids.
---
Genuinely difficult? When worlds first CHALLENGE MODE kill happens only barely 3 hours after release?
---
Genuinely rewarding? They are on rank what... 4 or 5 currently in g/h? And thats when you do them ONCE per week.
---
Raids are pure easy mode in gw2. And with each shift in balance, with each powercreep, they get even easier. They LOOK great, but thats it.
---
congratulations; I uh; didn't list nearly that many myself.
---
Might be race related. I've never seen it on an asura on my charr ranger.
---
Like many have stated, it's not that the game isn't fun, hell it's really fun, gw2's combat is more satisfying than any other mmo I've played so far. 
---
The negativity comes from there just not being a whole lot to do after you get the skins/armor/weps you want. PVE doesn't really reward that much if you've got yourself a good set of gear and don't really care for legendaries or have them already.
---
Most people are negative because it's like we have this really fun, great, satisfying game.. but we've played it so much and there isn't anything new coming in so we're just like.. welp.
---
I know personally I just tell people that I've 'beaten' Gw2. Love the game, had great times, but yeah. Just doesn't have much more to offer than 4 month long wait periods between big content drops.
---
I can attest to you that everyone here, even the negative speakers, love this game to bits. I mean it's why we keep coming to this reddit, just to see how our favorite mmo child is doing, and in hopes of seeing some inspiring news.
---
Anet likes to do small conveniences for big amounts of gold forcing you to use an item for roughly a year before it becomes worth it.  That is what is happening here too.  People are purely speculating you'll need a gift of upgrades + 3 other items for the forge to make a single legendary rune.  1 gift of upgrades is ~720g at current prices.  720x6=4320g  which just seems way too high for just one gift but not totally out of the ballpark.  We will have to wait and see.
---
You're not reapplying a buff... You're going for a drink in the guild tavern!

---
mordrem plating I could see. what with Mordremoth having been defeated now. Caithe stuff; nah that's unique to her.
---
800 gold per. 6 runes and 4 sigils is 8-9k gold
---
Do we have any source for that?
---
This is being done for the whales who absolutely need to have everything.
---
Feelsbadman
---
If you don't want it that's fine, I myself am considering getting it eventually to cut down on inventory space (I have 6 sets of runes and around 8 sigils on my mesmer right now)
---
Before you tell me to get more bag space, I like having the clean inventory as opposed to needing it to hold more things.
---
1) the type who will try to find any excuse to try to brag
---
2) ones who have too much money to care, either in game or IRL
---
3) ones who are at the stage of making legendaries but somehow still unaware that in gw2 legendary provides no stat advantage
---
4) something about inventory space ...

A bunch of whiners feeding off of other people's whining. Then some streamer leaves the game and it validates them, and with a critical mass of dissatisfaction it's now multiple threads per day of bitching and moaning that they're not having as much fun now with a game that they've been playing for 5 years or more.
---
I guess they hate it so much that they can't stop talking about it but I wish they'd just delete it from their computers, unsubscribe here, and take up crochet to fill their time.
---
That better include a search bar and/or filter because that just sounds like a gigantic pain in the ass.
---
Im really waiting for a long curly hair, thorns perhaps, for a long time. Norn have such long hairs and humans have them too.
---
&gt; I'm thinking that this is outrageous even for a legendary, considering you need 6 of them.
---
Maybe it puts out 6 runes.
---
Thank you very much!
---
If it's that cheap for a whole set, count me in. If it's the costs people are throwing around, I'd rather just save up and buy a permanent upgrade extractor instead.
---
1. It'll for sure be more than 500g and that's fine. 
---
2. They will not.
---
When did I ever say anything like that? Look at the picture in the news post, it has a giant ass scroll bar. People are talking about not wanting to have to scroll through every rune in the game. But that's a dev screenshot, they likely *had* every rune in the game in that screenshot. What's likely is that if you've made your first legendary run ever, then you only see that rune as an option, and you won't have to scroll through every rune in the game to find it. Do you understand now?
---
&gt; Also permanent extractor is in the gemstore...
---
Where? Unless you mean from the BLC's in which case that's not really a viable way to get one unless you're dropping a few grand and at that point just convert the gems to gold and buy one off the TP.
---
Since we're talking living world, yes, I have.

A **lot** more costly. You need 150 legendary insights which drop once per boss, to be precise, and that goes up to 300 for the second and subsequent sets.
---
You can theoretically get 25 LIs per week, if you complete all 7 wings and convert your Legendary Divinations, which means you'd have to full-buy for 6 weeks in a row to complete your first set. I have no clue what raid fights sell for these days, and you could probably get a discount by buying cheaper fights and spending a few extra weeks on it. That said, at 20 gold per boss (which is pretty low, not even doubling the payout for the raid team), it'd cost _3,000 gold_ to buy the LIs needed for your first set of legendary armour. I expect it'd cost more in practice, not counting the difficulty of finding consistent raid sellers every week and the time you'd have to invest in it, and ignoring the material cost for actually _making_ the armour once you have the LIs and achievements. And if you want a second set, congrats on 12 weeks and &gt;6000 gold in buys!
---
IMO the rework is thematically on-point but falls flat on its face. It's bad.
---
In order to maintain your durability, you have to use a power build. Condition damage doesn't work with Impact Savant despite core engineer having loads of condition damage. Reduced damage from traits in the spec means it does less damage than it did before, which wasn't a ton in the first place. Engineer lacks the power weapons for this interaction to be interesting.
---
Bulwark Gyro's per-player scaling does not benefit from healing power, even if you wanted healing (which you now don't). This was overpowered, and I think the way it works now is nice as it incentivizes actually pulling damage from allies. However, the half-assed scaling is a huge pet peeve of mine. If you're going to redesign a skill, be thorough and do it right.
---
The new function gyros are still borderline-worthless in PvE. In PvP, it has much less health than before. Enemies do not need to interrupt the gyro. They can just kill it with a couple downed hits, or one-shot it with an auto attack. This is *by far* the worst and laziest elite spec mechanic in the game.
---
There are two glaring issues I have with why they did this...
---
1) Scrapper has a health penalty, but the balance team seemingly does not take base health into account when balancing the damage-dealing capability of other professions.
---
2) Having Scrapper be a close-range dps elite spec when Holosmith is a close-range dps elite spec is extremely uninteresting.
---
I am deffo gonna do them, and most gifts material you can farm, no? Or is there special gifts here that are not farmable?

I don't raid or fractal either.  I just randomly map complete and do metas.  All of my characters got their gear transmuted.  I've never bought any.  I'll never use them all either.
---
Gem discounts will exist if there was not player market for exchange, any gem discount in general would affect the player market and create a inflation.
---
Other games can do those sales because there is not a player driven economy of this type.
---
IRL terms, is like you exchanging euros for dollars and viceversa + a transaction fee from the bank.
---
Is not like you go to the bank and they tell you "change 100 dollars and get 25% more euros"
---
But if you think about banks offering "money" to open check accounts, the similar thing here is to buy a higher version of a expansion to get free gems ;)
---
Gems and gold here is the equivalent to Real Life money trading in a bank, so not discounts but pure adjusted price.
---
You can even think about the stuff over in /r/GW2exchange as a RL aution houses for the real rich.
---
I read the tweet/blog post and about 80% of the comments. This doesn't appear to apply to me yet (still running with the lvl80 token gear and haven't attmepted factals yet.) I assume it's relatively good news for a new-ish player once I am on the path to Legendary?
---
Gorgeous!
---
WvW and PvP rewardtrack give you 50 for each track you finnish. It is likely not at all faster but this is a option if you enjoy those game modes.
---
Not if you take the real definition of "gross".
---
They actually added one new hairstyle, one face and a couple of horns ( some of them previously gender locked ) to charr with episode 2 and the introduction of the Olmakhan. 
---
Other than that, no major updates like faces or hairstyles have been added since July 2016. Not to mention other stuff like new tats for Norn or new ears for Sylvari. 
---
So yeah, I fully agree that we need new options. I just really hope they're gonna at least consult people like Kristen Perry who did the  redesign for Sylvari to their more plantlike anatomy and worked on a lot of the other races as well. They tend to just do whatever they want ( the female verdant executor outfit doesn't really follow the design philosophy behind Sylvari at all for example ) and I don't want them to butcher even more of the distinct style of the races.
---
You ask the impossible of this sub.
---
Well, too late anyways. I retired my mesmer and having a blast with Firebrand now!
---
Chrono just is no longer fun for me after this last patch. I'm now really glad that I made alts.
---
&gt;The runecrafters one gives lucent motes, which are used to make runes/sigils (any crafting profession has various new recipes using these crystals and charms) )
---
The way you worded this is misleading. All salvage kits can give lucent motes and symbols/charms, if they happen to salvage an upgrade.
---
ty for info! am not that often on gw2 exchange cuz i am poor QQ  
---
...or maybe thats the cause. :D
---
Not very deep if it's just farming tons of mats. What if I have 36 pieces of gear I want to outfit with legendary upgrades.
---
Remember when living world was fixing signs? Yeah, I'd say we're well past that level now. Back then it made sense to call living world a thing for "between major releases", but it has grown so much that it can now *be* the major releases.
---
Quite frankly if it costs more than like half of what it takes to make a legendary set it just straight up isn't worth it. Not for convenience (because it looks tedious to swap), not for value, and probably not for future proofing either.
---
***
---
For my fully decked out ele: I have 11 different rune sets I swap depending on the game mode / what I'm doing. I have 2x 28 slot invisible bags: one for all the extra rings+amulets (since there's legendary everything else), stat infusion swaps, and weapon swaps. The other 28 slot invisibag has the 11 rune sets and 15 sigils. This character has full legendary armor, every possible legendary weapon for equipment swapping (1x staff, 1x scepter, 1x focus, 2x dagger, 1x trident, 1x sword, 1x warhorn), backpack, aurora, vision, and coalescence.
---
But let's just talk about runes specifically.
---
A non-discounted bag slot costs 143g (rounding up) right now. At 240 Gems discounted price: **86g**. Crafting an invisible bag costs:
---
* 20 slots: 10g 33s 89c
---
* 24 slots: 27g 20s 24c
---
* 28 slots: **55g 00s 62c**
---
* 32 slots: 120g 04s 86c
---
A set of 7 runes (because having +1 makes saves me from having to manually move it back into the bag) for these 11 sets would cost me, at current values of instant buy or crafting (whichever is cheapest): **121g**. Lower if I use Testimonies of Heroics for two of the sets and this excludes the cost of the two dungeon sets I use as well.
---
So for the sake of having all of these runes available for quick swapping (ignoring the sigils for now), I've made an investment of **262g** (86g+55g+121g)
---
The crafting cost for a full set of the PvE legendary light armor right now is at [**2118g 96s 42c**](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-80248;1-80131;1-80190;1-80111;1-80356;1-80399) (using GW2Efficiency's calculator).
---
Addressing the *value* problem: First and foremost: The crafting costs of most runes have gone up significantly since the changes made earlier this year. A set which may have cost a few gold to make before is now in the range of 15-25 gold now. Even Runes you could get from BLK salvaging saw a bit of a price hike, though they're still significantly cheaper than crafting. If Anet is using an internal algorithm to look at the TP values of the given materials to craft a rune set, that will dramatically spike the cost of what they expect a legendary rune to be worth.
---
Addressing the *convenience* problem: This is a bit trickier because there's a lot of factors to consider here in regards to recent changes.
---
1. Item drops have been (for the most part) normalized into unidentified gear and thus reduce a lot of bag clutter. Only a few game modes such as Fractals (random drops + rewards) or if you're running full siege options in WvW will really bloat your bag space now. That and if you're unpacking a ton of festival items I suppose. That is to say: **there's less pressure to reduce bag clutter / expand bag space per character now.**
---
2. Legendary gear lets you freely swap rune sets on the fly. While it could be cool to swap between runes used in ascended gear on the fly, the reality is that your power-based armor set will always want to use power-based runes. That dramatically limits the potential range of use right off the bat, though you can remove these legendary runes and put them into another set of gear if you like. *Note: Legendary weapons can now freely swap sigils as well.**
---
3. The UI looks a bit bloated for selecting the rune set you want. Though I know there's still a few people who do not use a full 6-set piece bonus of a rune set, I can't help but think that the legendary runes should unlock a new UI feature similar to what sPvP does for rune selection, though I know that probably wouldn't translate well to gameplay.
---
4. If you plan on making the legendary runes for your exotic/ascended gear, you're still going to need multiple sets of gear to utilize the different stat orientations available.
---
The culmination of all of this is that if the legendary runes cost too much to make (i.e. like the 1,000 gold per people are expecting now thanks to the leaked [Gift of Upgrades](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades) — currently 5583g 00s 00c for a set of 6), there is just no point in making them at all. You would be better off making multiple legendary armor sets for multiple characters and then just buying the spare rune sets and bag slots/invisible bags to go with them. Like, orders of magnitude of value.
---
Legendary weapons are still arguably a pretty bad deal considering you end up gravitating around 1-5 different stat variations on a given class x weapon, but they also come with cosmetic novelty. Each ascended weapon you make costs about 40-60g (depending on the stats and assuming you stat swap for expensive ones), so to get a single weapon at 1200-2600g is a bit extreme and you technically don't even save bag space on sigils for swapping either. You could make over 20 different ascended weapons + sigil combos for the price of 1x legendary. You're mostly making them for the cosmetic aspects and taking the stat swapping + sigil/infusion swapping as a perk.
---
Legendary armor on the other hand is still expensive, but a much more significant convenience. Each ascended armor set comes out to about 250g (still using ele as an example, excluding aquabreather and rune costs), so when I had 5 different sets I had effectively spent more than half of what it cost for a legendary set and now I have more freedom with infusions (huuuge money saver if I want to stat infuse it all) or variant swaps (like which pieces to move to Assassins from Berserker for fractals vs. raids).
---
or the real tl;dr: **Why would anyone spend as much as it takes to make 2 full legendary armor sets with the supporting runes/bags to go with them on these legendary runes?**
---
Don't get me wrong: I'm still probably going to make them. I just know it's a terrible idea and I'm an idiot for doing so.
---
I think they'd be reasonable if the price range was somewhere between 50-80 gold per rune it would actually be reasonable. Maybe up to 100g for myself personally. Still more than 20x expensive than your average rune, but with the utility of future proofing and swap on demand they could be useful rather than a complete waste of gold.
---
My measly 300g pale in comparison, duh.
---
This isn't a solution, it's an absurd gold sink that is far more expensive than the existing alternative. 99% of players will be better off pretending this doesn't exist, which makes it an abysmal failure at solving that problem.
---
Completely forgot about the Charr stuff with LWS4E2 which kinda goes to show how long it's been that it's easy to forget. If it's really been since July 2016 than essentially the only additions to customization has been those added because they were required for the story NPCs.
---
While I do think it's great to combine development like that, it's also really sad because we used to get at least one update a year with new hairs/faces and considering cosmetics is really the only endgame we have left it's incredibly upsetting to see it be ignored for evidently 3 years now.
---
As a not-so-new but haven't done tarir all that regularly player: I didn't know the armors from the events were different from the ones you can just pick up, I've always wondered why the events are even there. I am also guilty of winning an armor (for the achievement) only to immediately drop it because I didn't feel like playing as armor. Thanks for teaching me something!
---
got a source? i'm really interested and i missed it :)
---
"Anet won't tell me what's happening a year from now, I don't know how I can possibly continue playing without knowing!"
---
Yes i mean the blc one. Blc is gemstore and Gold exchange is gemstore which means either way the thing is obtainable through gemstore. It costs around 2k Gold which is (atm) the estimated cost for one! legendary Rune. So whats the better Deal? All this pricetalk is pure speculation on my side i have to admit.. I only find it kinda silly that gemstore/legy armor already solved the same issue the legy runes should be for...
---
&gt; "Just on Reddit" - sure, that's why most of the gw2 guilds I'm in have dead discords where people used to be active everyday, on voice channels doing raids / fractals / WvW.
---
Comprehension failed, try again.
---
Then there are veteran elitist player (who cleared raidbossers over 1000 times) who just 1burn it out of principle, since its possible
---
wtf the day I actually agree with Nikes opinions has come. The end is near.
---
You probably got late and ended up in fresh instance. I see players on every boss, every time IF I'm just a little bit ahead of time. Optionally open lfg, maybe there is a taxi to other instance. Or just start your own lfg
---
&gt;I'm not sure how to calculate the precision needed for optimal damage since different skills hit for varying amounts
---
* Ignore skill damage as your crit chance affects ~~it all~~ non condition stuff equally
---
* 21 points of precision is 1% higher crit chance, or C^%
---
* 15 points of ferocity is 1% higher crit damage, or C^d
---
* Right, so your equipment stats go to two decimal places for crit chance. So here's what you do. Let's take a 59.37% crit chance at, uhhh, 1123 power with 213.7% crit damage.
---
* 10,000 hits sampled out, shall we?
---
* 5937 of these hits are critical damage
---
* (10,000 - 5937) of them are peasant tier non-critical hits (4063)
---
* The total base damage of these hits (ie not multiplied out by weapon skill modifiers) is 5937 x 1123 x 2.137 + 4063 x 1123, totalling 18,810,664
---
* A simpler, more formulaic way to represent this is 1123(4063 + 5937x2.137) or **Power x ("1 - C^% "+ "C^% x C^d ")**
---
* Now if you want to optimize, see if you can do things like add crit chance for free by figuring a way to maintain permanent fury uptime (flat 20%: 59.37% &gt; 79.37%) or by adding a sigil of accuracy (flat 7%), then see the change in the result of that formula by, say, adding 1 to C^% but subtracting 21 from Power (as though you swapped stats around to trade power for precision)
---
* Note this is the **base of what you produce as output** affected by things such as "sword skills get 10% increased damage and 33% reduced recharge" or "hit 5% higher when above x% health" or "deal 7% increased damage to burning foes"
---
* This is also affected by the target, such as enemy players who may have runes to reduce incoming damage or condition damage, or players and bosses who have armor values (affected by toughness), special mechanics, or might just be really scary so you run away instead of fighting.
---
You'll find in general that with really high power, like in *your* build, reducing the power stat by a fraction of a percent to raise C^% by one is a net gain, since it effectively lets you produce critical damage instead of regular damage that extra percent of the time. The trick is to hit 100% crit chance with methods that dont require lowering other stats to raise precision. That's where the theorycraft comes in. Example: the sigil of accuracy vs the sigil of force (really it would be vs sigil of impact but force is easier to calculate with). Extra 5% damage, or extra 7% accuracy? The question you have to answer here is: **if i take force over accuracy, but lose 147 points (7 x 21) of power to get 147 points of precision to make up for it, are those 147 points of power outweighed by the 5% extra damage from force?**
---
If you assume you're always going toward 100% crit chance, the calculation easier to deal with as it becomes simply Power x C^d - in this case you'd be looking at whether 147 is 5% of your power, and if it's less than 5% you would select sigil of force. The threshold there is **2940**. Your linked build is less than 2940 power, so you would take accuracy before force, EXCEPT that you will have stacks of might in groups and probably on your own (i dont play mesmer idk how might generation works for them). 3 stacks of might and suddenly youre passing that threshold, meaning: if you're commited to maintaining 100% crit chance, it's better to take sigil of force and lower power by 147 to make room to raise precision by 147, as long as you can keep up a few stacks of might. And given how close your linked build is to that threshold, if you let might drop you wouldnt even notice the 1-2% loss of net power without arcdps.
---
Hope this wasnt too mustardy to wanna read it :)

Asking for community feedback? Turn it into a conversation not just an announcement. Better yet take questions from twitch chat? Or vote of topics to be discussed? The way they handle PR is very one-sided. Whenever I tune into the stream it’s just the host saying random stuff like ohhh I remember that or that’s funny while asking superficial questions to the few people they have on. Idk, maybe the host sucks and it’s not necessarily the format.
---
You must have missed the whole lay off episode.
---
Just watch a YouTube recap and save the sub fee.
---
What's really interesting about the current state of raids is sure, Gw2 was not a "raid-focused game," but historically GW2 did raids better in two different ways; W1-3 had a better release cadence and W5 had the two greatest raid bosses (especially in CM). W6 and W7 did not follow up to provide either frequency or depth. No one was pretending, but people were hoping for change and the recent track record has been fewer, less challenging raids while sustaining (increasing even?) LS content and production, sustained recycled events, and an incredible amount of effort in the gem store. People have been leaving for some time so the "exodus" didn't start just now, but the combination of Wow Classic, FFXIV's Shadowbringers, a deep backlog of games (Dark Souls for me &lt;3), and the coming season of big games have given some people enough of a nudge to stop GW2 all around the same time.
---
I mean they just have to look at other successful companies though in the industry. Yeah they get hella backlash when they say certain things the community disagrees with but, they still make the effort to communicate anyways. Often even apologizing on video when they get stuff slightly wrong. It’s more about accountability than anything else.
---
Yeah, seems reasonable, but that's only half the solution. We can give them all the feedback we want, and they can acknowledge all the feedback they want. As long as they don't spend more resources on fixing the problems with this game, the feedback is useless. I just don't see that happening.
---
And the part of the 'community backlash' on some actual communication is when that piece of communication we got in all 6 month so we kinda expected something from that.
---
Copy.  Much appreciate the responses!
---
Time to get back into the actual playing...
---
It is just bigger, golden, and higher stats.
---
On the Dhuum CM point though, he’s referring specifically to PvE content though. Personally it’s the thing I enjoyed doing most in the game, mostly because my static got so many hours out of it and I loved the theme. But what would you say is the best example of PvE design, and also in general the game as a whole?
---
&gt; just taking credit
---
how much credit is op taking? 
---
who's credit was taken?
---
why can't this be the best screenshot they ever *tooken* (made)? unless you took time to browse through all the other screens and objectively grade them...
---
no offence, just wondering. (i.e do not take this seriously)
---
HoT is an 81 on metacritic with the lowest score being a 60. I wasn't around for release (so idk the "mood" around HoT) but I wouldn't call an 81 "very bad" by any stretch.
---
Gathering tools, aquabreather perhaps.
---
I think it at least quells some of the community unrest though. In the sense that yes you’re right, it won’t fix the problems outright, but at the very least it shows they care and we have a reason to stick around and see what happens. The most recent things I’ve noticed from the team mainly being legendary runes and the plant chair make me feel like they have just given up.
---
I like the male ponytale one and wish it's get added to female options
---
I will farm it for you.  In return of farming it for you I will be keeping 100% of all profit made.
---
Legendaries started as a visual endgame. They were GW2's original aspirational content. They later sweetened the deal by making them desirable from a quality of life standpoint. First with attribute swapping, then with upgrade swapping. These were all good decisions. People who never really found any legendary skins to suit their personal taste still pursued them because the wardrobe always allowed the visuals to be decoupled from the convenience they offer. 
---
Then we got legendary trinkets. Trinkets have never needed to interact in any way with the wardrobe, so suddenly visual effects and quality of life were linked. If you want their QoL, you have to sacrifice control over your character's appearance. Some among us are holding out hope that we will eventually get an auras/embellishments wardrobe, which would allow legendary trinkets to just unlock their effects as auras upon acquisition, and allow players to once again decouple visual effects and QoL. 
---
Now we have legendary upgrades that strictly offer convenience. That's... different. It would be highly unfair to criticize this decision after the feedback on legendary trinkets, but the long-established precedent is that legendary items have aspirational visual effects. If this was done because they're taking feedback regarding the legendary trinkets to heart, that's great. That might mean an auras wardrobe is under consideration, and, maybe legendary upgrades will retroactively provide aura unlocks when it is ready for release. It is entirely possible they just simply never had any intention of legendary upgrades providing any visual effects. If so, I just can't avoid the cynical thought that a future quality of life feature could be gated behind a legendary gizmo.
---
When looking at the addition from a purely quality of life perspective I can only assume these will become much more desirable when build templates finally ship. Or perhaps if there are a lot of difficult to acquire (maybe account-bound?) upgrades coming in the future. Right now there is certainly one thing consistent across all legendaries: cost. They're going to spike higher in price initially because of the hype (and, if I'm correct, again when build templates are released), but I'd be genuinely surprised if these ever fall to a price point that I would be interested in pursuing them. One can certainly dare to hope.
---
So, some things:
---
i find the mpagination lovely, and i like how you exposed the main characteristics of race and culture with a very quick but wide approach. Remember, silvarys in a game might not quite be the ones of guild wars 2 that we play, so too much detail can get in the way - but seems you got it quite right.
---
I am less convinced with races traits, that i think can be discussed a bit. I don't mind unbalanced races, for better or worse, as long as they provide an unique feel.
---
\- Living Sap is probably a much less interesting choiche that it might be.
---
I think it's a good thing to have a race feature tied to sun and plants, but this is kinda underwhelming for various reasons.
---
First, it does not exist in dnd a "out of combat state". Most often that is tied to the "short rest" so to speak, so it's overall better if it acter during a short rest.
---
Second, this is basically a health pool amplification. To give context, the stout feature of the dwarf gives a +1 hit points and is comparable to slightly less of a d2 each level of health. living Sap is applied only to after-combat damage once per short rest, and it's higher at level 1, but gives much less at later levels. So to speak, a dwarf evens it out at level 2-3, and then it has more, just for that race feature, without resorting to effects triggered on a later time.
---
Now, not every race needs to be equal and have equally powerful features one at one, at all. But this shows up how much underwhelming and overly-complex it is compared to a base health increase.
---
i suggest you to change it to something more codifeable, and that works better along hit dices for short rest. But even in that case you should really beef up the effect, since it's one of the main race features while others have of more powerful and concise. I would suggest to drop the dice per level  and instead say it increases short rest heal while in direct sunlight ( something that averages more than a +2 for heach hit dice spent). Or just something more fancyful.
---
\- Barkskin it's a 2nd level spell, so it's not necessary to be level 3 to cast it if it's the only one you have. It follows similar things from the eladrin, that can cast misty step every short rest. In your case it's better leave it to long rest, barkskin is an ongoing effect so it risks to be up everytime, but having it coupled with a cantrip makes it good to be available to level 1.
---
\- Attuned to Nature seems an obvious choice, thought i have a personal dislike for races that give two or more skill proficiences. I think Nature is enough because having two race skills limits what the character might be - not everyone is adept to survive out of the grove, after all. But nature, surely. I would suggest  to make a check similar to Dwarven stonework related to investigation or history while inspecting plants rather the survival skill.
---
are they this scared of having people on reddit or ingame to simply talk to people? maybe content producers / veterans of all kind?
---
The build looks fun, I was thinking about trying something similar when they buffed the pistol/dagger dual attack skill. Also, I watch your videos from time to time and they're great. It's refreshing to see people doing different builds in PvE.
---
Don't know if an "official survey" will help after all that's being said on forums lately, but I just completed this survey as honestly as I could. Hopefully they take some time to see patterns with everybody's comments.
---
The expansion was sold advertising a new set of legendary weapons, but we only got four, plus one more in the following months. Took them more than a year to start releasing the rest, and last one wasn't released until last patch, four years after HoT's release.
---
They're actually leather human tier 3 cultural pants. Occam's is a name referring to a character theme of a stat set.
---
&gt;Honor of the Waves Story endboss
---
I remember spending hours trying to solo that one, fml
---
No one said anything about the hours. The deal here is efficiency, and not wasting your time and your employee's in the first place.
---
My thing about casual vs. hardcore is that it carries a connotation that I find misleading. When we say casual we may understand it more as someone who plays a couple times a week and doesn’t focus too much on builds or rotations. I think what Nike is getting at and who Anet is targeting is the type of casual player who expects everything given to them and hates any sort of challenge or achievement/goal. Like you can casually play the game and get a legendary but, a lot of people on this subreddit will comment on someone saying they are casual and have a legendary like “well you have a legendary that’s pretty hard core”. Furthermore I personally don’t think it has to be an either or situation. I still have trouble understand the argument against a story mode with different rewards. If Anet wants to make 95% of the game very very casual, that’s fine but, give the hardcore players one thing to hang on to or enjoy. Give them challenging raid content. And honestly even from a new player, first raid perspective Earth Djinn and Qadim 2 are really easy. If you are new you’re likely not tanking or focusing on major mechanics, and if you are I’d say it’s going to be hard no matter what. The DPS players have very little the have to worry about on those two fights, and while Air Djinn will result in brutal wipes for new players once you get the hang of it, it’s easy to adjust to. The fights are very forgiving in that it isn’t a DPS check.
---
If they integrate well with built templates (whenever those come in), imagine just needing one set of runes for your account, ever.  Doesn't matter if you're switching characters or builds or between Raids and Fractals and WvW.  Idk, I can see that having real value to a good number of people.
---
Maybe that's a big if.  Point being if they make this a supreme convenience feature through smart systems design they can justify a lot.  Up to them to execute.
---
I mean 800g is probably too high but then you pulled that out of thin air so whatever.
---
They openly fired Peter Friez but you think they wouldn't do the same for Colin? 
---
Like use your brain for 2 seconds.
---
I'd rather be a statue than have to stand like that all the time, and nearly EVERY female in the game stood that way, too.
---
No hard feelings, I'm not a native English speaker so I'd wager they're far from perfect. I write them when I'm bored, compiling ideas that spawn during talks with the guild and other friends.
---
**Rooba:** *Oh no. My dear 5000. This world didn't deserve you. At least the fire elemental was stopped before it could do too much damage.* 
---
Well, at least for the next 2 hours...
---
A survey can get better sampling although there will still be selection bias.
---
Blurred frenzy doesn't give distortion, it's just an evade.
---
Moss for body hair please. And fluffy updos for female.
---
Big expose, very cool
---
Pretty sure Anet makes posts on their website about gem store sales.
---
The storyline is also very boring, I don't feel compelled to play it at all. A Song of Fire and Ice, that's an example of a good story.
---
were they asking the right questions?
---
*Who's pants are those*

**Rooba:** *Oh no. My dear 5000. This world didn't deserve you. At least the fire elemental was stopped before it could do too much damage.*

2 hours later, Fire Elemental: Well yes, but actually no.

Oh wow. You spent so long arguing with a bot that you needed to make a new account to get around it.
---
Ok, you're getting blocked. You have something seriously wrong with you. Seek professional help.
---
For people who might want to buy a single episode, instead of them all at once.
---
If you have 200 Gems and the option between buying one episode or all you’re missing. You might be more inclined to buy the one episode and save up for the rest later.
---
Dhuum CM is definitely the pinnacle of GW2 PvE IMO. Challenging, engaging, no random shit in it like fractals or bounties, a shitton of fun.
---
50g/sigil is probably too cheap. 
---
One set should be priced at around or a little bit less than the equivalent of an upgrade extractor contract to be attractive. (So around 200g per upgrade) If they're too much cheaper than that they'll become something basically obligatory and the sigil/rune markets will more or less crash like exotic markets did with the introduction of ascended armor/weapons. (Their value will be basically driven by their salvage mats and not by the items themselves). 
---
If they're too much more than that (like they appear to be right now) no one will make them because the opportunity cost relative to a permanent upgrade extractor will be too high.
---
anyone got the PoE acc name of nike? im interested in his chars
---
They were asking some decent questions about different type of content and what you like and dislike, but it feels like there's not enough individual comment boxes to elaborate on those scale of 1 - 5 choices. I had to cram all my suggestions and opinions into one or two text boxes.
---
I'd love that. I mean, the rune unlock thing already exists in pvp and I never understood why we didn't somehow get this for PvE.
---
They went to Amazon Games for different projects as far as i remember
---

The only thing is that I don’t think the devs we have now are incapable of doing great things. I think they have proven the can. The biggest problems seem to stem from the organization and direction of the resources the studio has, which ultimately comes to MO more or less who has been with us the entire time.
---
at least you can help with dps for another necro. thats something!
---
A classic.
---
When they laid off a *minority* of the company that was working on other stuff?
---
A random survey will do a better job of getting a broad spectrum of the community, among various other benefits. Content creators, veteran players and Reddit users aren't the only players who have worthwhile opinions, after all, and they likely have biases that aren't necessarily reflective of the population as a while.
---
You can probably ask him on Twitter!
---
Anet doesn't know EU exists
---
I really should have added a /s huh
---
&gt; Lmao first you say it's all made up drama then you go pull random percentages like 20% and 5% of players are affected on your other comment. You're actually dumber than I thought.
---
Random numbers? Yeah, I see who is dumb here. ;)
---
It's a well known fact that only ~20% of the playerbase of a game even look into forum etc. for the game. 80% are quit player, who "only" play the game. Less than these 20% even write stuff in forums like reddit. It's also well known that the whole drama here comes from a few people who just cry out loud. So yes, 5% is a realistic number. 
---
But since you don't even this well known things, it's pretty comprehensibly that you have no idea what I'm talking about and think these few reddit posts affects the whole playerbase, so you think I'm dumb. Typical Dunning-Kruger-Effect. 
---
&gt; Also you don't know what discord is?
---
Oh, please quote me, I forgot that I ever said that I don't know what discord is. Or that I even talked about discord at all. I wait for your quote. ;)
---
&gt; I can see why this other person is saying you're an idiot.
---
He never did, you should learn to read properly. ;)
---
&gt; I'm so glad I uninstalled gw2 I don't have to play with people like you.
---
Good for you, now be so free and leave instead of spreading tantrum on something that doesn't concern you. ;)
---
people who do this most likely already have full legendary gear on a class the would use this new item, so a permanent upgrade extractor would do nothing.  
---
this is convenience in terms of used inventory space for all the different runes of sigils you run.
---
As always anet wants to know statistics without context. That's why revenue is bad indicator of game health or playerbase priorities.
---
Why is there such a low limit on number of guilds to join... Especially since guild does so little now, and representation doesn't matter, why can't the limit be bumped up to 10?
---
Really well done!
---
And I'm assuming it's due to artistic choice or a desire to leave their origin vague, but we know why the Sylvari were made, they are Mordy's minions but the Pale Tree purified and protected them from his corruption.
---
the question is what kind of questions are there in the survey.  
---
if they ask: how do you think about the class balance?  
---
...do you really think that the broad community which doesn't even read reddit and plays 1h every 2 days do have "worthwhile" opinions?  
---
imagine doing a survey which is in total biased in a certain way or totally bullshit because you ask people which literally have no deeper understanding of the game.
---
Boss rush gave 50 of a few of them too.
---
legendary gear already lets you swap out runes/sigils for free. so the only benefit there is saving a few inventory slots. for non-legendary gear, there's very few cases where swapping runes/sigil without being able to swap stats on the item itself makes much sense. it can easy the cost of upgrading after a balance patch, but apart from that there's really not much benefit. some classes may have a few builds with the same base stats but different sigils, but it's pretty rare, maybe between raid and fractal builds, but otherwise I don't see much of a point to it. 
---
all that said, I won't pay more than 50g per upgrade component, because their actual value is so low and I wonder how many people who actually do the math will be interested at all, even at that price.
---
and upgrade extractors are a really bad argument. you can get the money they cost back, if you don't mind getting carpal tunnel. being able to swap runes/sigil on gear you use is the least of their uses, and for most players it's far to annoying and too time consuming to do that on the fly when swapping builds in raids/fractals or even wvw.
---
I started gw2 back in 2013 and went to ff14 one year ago. Anet isn't interested in pushing more content. The main goal of gw2 is getting players for some weeks, let them pay for some gem stuff and let them leave just to start the cycle again 3 months later. That's why Anet is making so many gem only items. They could easily use their resources tho make more free content but that's not their intention. This is also the reason why Anet is making more and more pay for convenience items as well as loot boxes for the gem store. To convince, part time players that make up most of gw2 player base, to pay.
---
*Something something Malyck.*
---
Only NA?!? I am part of this trip since Prophecies and BWEs and I don't get one? xD Hopefully it will be EU too.
---
Lol. Your grammar is horrible and your logic is faulty. Thanks for admitting you made it all up by reiterating those percentages as "well known things" without citations or actual references. So it's alternative news, then. You're making things up. Second, the commenter above me quite literally and directly told you you're an idiot, perhaps you simply don't understand English well enough but I'm more likely to think you're actually this daft. Yikes. Based on the way you form sentences you're either not a native English speaker or you're too dumb to edit. And third, you can't even comprehend the thought of people discussing how the game has issues off of Reddit and on other forums (like how they're complaining on the official anet one) or social media such as discord. My guess is you don't use it or you're not active in any gw2 discords. Which is why you were saying you don't understand the other person. That's sad. You don't even get that. Oh and the saddest part is you can't even grasp the original point that started this whole thread. You're part of the community that celebrates people leaving gw2, and your behavior and direct comments make the gw2 community come off as toxic. Oh, and overusing emojis such as ;) only makes you look dumber. I get it, you don't know what you're talking about so you want to use that as filler for your poorly worded sentences.
---
No, companies do this all the time to get feedback from different areas in different ways. Even Blizzard emails people random surveys across all their products.
---
Last time I checked [Serpent's Ire daily chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Domain_of_Vabbi:_Hero%27s_Choice_Chest) only rewards you with 3x Unid Rare and ~~your choice of stuff~~  1x Amalgamated Gemstones. More like 2g20s and neither of those are exclusive account-bound rewards. The other rewards, such as the elegy mosaics and champ bags, are evergreen rewards you always get. Not that Serpent's Ire is really worth running in the first place if you're after an efficiency gold farm.
---
Same with the other meta events you're mentioning: The Amalgamated is the only real daily locked reward (and isn't account bound), but the map currencies and misc drops / chests you can open are evergreen so long as you have the keys to open said chests. You're also free to make as many Amalgamated Gemstones as you want per day via mystic forge or buy them off of the Trading Post.
---
World bosses in general aren't all that rewarding and the main reason you see people pop in to those and map metas is to work on other collections as well. For example: I only run TD meta to get more crystals to slowly progress on that weapon collection and the Amalgamated Gemstone is just a bonus which makes it worth running once a day. But if I'm just after raw gold farm or gold farm to put toward buying an item, I'd probably just spend that time in the Silverwastes or Dragonfall. Take the stuff from farming there to buy the other stuff I need more of. If I'm after raw map currency, I'm better off just farming events on the map in general.
---
So I guess my question for you is: If it's something you can still get as much as you want of but from different sources, is it really a timegate?
---
Stuff like Charged Quartz — that's a timegate. Account bound required item for various crafting/collections and the only other way to get it beyond crafting is through mining your home instance node or really *really* low drop rate from some festival boxes you can buy from the TP (like Wintersday).
---
&gt;Other mmos have what I call baseline rewardlevels. You get approx. the same rewards no matter what you do, with extra chance of shinies and some currency + exp for doing the timegate.
---
I'm not sure how you think GW2 is different from this claim, but beyond that my experience with other MMOs is that this is *super* not the case. There is no reason to ever go back to a lower level zone unless you are pushed to go there for a quest and get the reward from that quest. ex.: In WoW, I know The Barrens was a huge meme but the reality is once I was done leveling there I never went back (unless leveling a new character). 
---
There wasn't any baseline value to be had, it was just a means to an end for leveling. Same with in how in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion I never went back to the starting zones I can't even remember the names of. There just wasn't much value to be had there. Not to mention the fact that, y'know, *daily* quests were timegated and hard capped at how many you could do each day. 
---
The "baseline" rewards I remember from WoW and FFXIV were basically just choosing to do 10 out of 15 possible different daily quests in endgame zones or use the dungeon finder. You get the guaranteed reward from the quest / objective and then you're done with that place until the next day. You'd just do the same loop in whatever the current hub is and then do a similar loop in whatever the next hub is in a few months.
---
Meanwhile in GW2 all of the rewards get scaled to level and while some things are definitely way more profitable than others, you're given a baseline value to expect for your time spent regardless of which zone you go to or what you're doing. Hell, they even added guaranteed map rewards for doing x many events in any given map. Even if you've already done your dailies, places like Fractals still reward Relics, Encryptions, and rare/exotic loot. You get *more* value out of your initial completion of a lot of different things, but you still get a good chunk of value from repeating them on the same day if you want to. But there's also so much to fucking do in 1x 24-hour cycle that if you do every bonus-chest related thing you probably wouldn't have time to do anything else.
---
There's daily *bonuses*, but I'm hard pressed to think of anything in GW2 you can only get one of per day with no other options. Guild trophy rewards for things like Teq/TT/Raids? Cosmic Essence from CMs? Maybe extend it to only 1 shot for certain skins per day like Teq/TT? Not exactly things I would consider disruptive to gameplay though.
---
Also... Don't other MMOs do the limited raid rewards too, but even more limited because it's only like 3 drops for 25 people 1x per week?
---
[Raid build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/), website should be updated in the next day or two for the latest patch. 
---
[Fractal build](https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-daredevil) and guides. 
---
[My general guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) with more build links, links to gearing guides, my take on raid content, raid training discord, etc.
---
Doesn't work with gathering because the nodes that give the currency items have an account limit. Although in some cases the limit is higher than what you can gather in one instance with one character.
---
Huh why is this getting downvoted? It’s a solid interface.
---
Both what?
---
Ehhh... Keep in mind that Metacritic is horrible for MMORPGs. Most get something betwen 70 and 80, regardless of quality. For example:
---
* [Age of Conan](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/age-of-conan-hyborian-adventures): 80
---
* [Aion](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/aion): 76
---
* [GW2's Path of Fire](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/guild-wars-2-path-of-fire): 83
---
* [Tera](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/tera): 77
---
* [Wildstar](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/wildstar): 82
---
* [WoW's Battle of Azeroth](https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth): 79
---
So it doesn't really correlate to how successful or how good those games were.
---
I'm not expecting much when it comes to Sylvari hairstyles. Last ones were a disappointment to me, felt like it wasn't the same person who designed them. They used to feel like they were part of the Sylvari's head, literally growing out of it, but the latest hairstyles just looked like wigs.
---
Email says "individually selected", who knows what that means...
---
a scroll bar and a search
---
Nothing here either :\ NA for reference.
---
oh boy is it time to ride this trend and put out as much whining as possible to capitalize
---
well, I'm certainly burned out, I haven't done anything else beside roller beetle races since December. can't bring my self to go back and do fractals or raids because they killed support chrono.
---
In addition to your list, I do the daily crafting of the four time-gated mats, charge up a quartz crystal and use my converterers. (For the gobblers - I use them only when I have at least a stack left of the corresponding materials.)
---
Also I usually do the PvE Dailies for the 2g.
---
Silently rolling out selective survey emails, I love how they keep doing the wrong thing over and over while desperately trying to figure out how to do the right thing 🤣
---
Dragonfall is pretty close.  Slight hiccup in how it encourages event farming, but there's a lot of good design there.
---
Same, one of my alt accounts got one about a month ago, my other accounts have not received one.
---
The Amazon games are already a failure.
---
Amazon is now moving them all over to a Lord of The Rings game.
---
&gt; Not everyone play with a single main character.
---
Yeah, neither do I lol. I know exactly what youre talking about. 
---
&gt; Account-wide unlocks are always better.
---
That is not inherently true. Sometimes having everything right off the bat on a new character defeats the purpose of making an alt other than to have different skills. 
---
Sometimes people just want to make an alto to start from zero and work their way up. Progression and a sense of accomplishment is something people need and this is something that GW 2 often times sorely misses. Especially at end game.
---
Still missing a legendary neck and one legendary ring.
---
[This is the item people are assuming will be part of the recipe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Upgrades)
---
Naw lol furthest from it.
---
Please /gg your life and take this garbage post with you &gt;.&gt;
---
Obviously you just do not want play WvW because you can farm Fractal 40 bullshit or shit on the shovels in the SW all day long, it is your choice.
---
Thing is that if you play WvW to any serious extend you have so much shit that you are set with ascended and legendary gear as well. I honestly deleted 30+ exotic armor boxes from WvW to clear storage for fucking ascended drops from WvW. And all of the WvW currency is so easy to get, that you do not even know where to sink 30k+ of yet another currency. 
---
Only grindy thing in WvW is 2k rank armor, witch is doable in 1-2 years from 0.
---
But well, I could invested all that time into shitting on the shovel in SW...
---
They Cancelled that they can fix it, like they say it will be recheduled.
---
Then again, maybe it puts out 1/4th of one rune.
---
Man this would have been handy! There was so much I wanted to say but I couldn't think of a good way of summarizing everything.
---
Curse that Scarl- oh wait.
---
Honestly, I just got another character, did the story for each map and tried to get the meta achievement. 
---
But I just didn't have a rush and took time to do the metas, heart completion, map completion and other events. For all maps together it took me less than a week. (Admittedly with very long days - 8+hours)
---
If you prefer doing it the daily way, just do hearts on every map everyday, buy the 5 currency from the vendor and if possible do the meta(s) (awards 5-10 currency too).
---
On Jahai Bluffs, the rift events give tons of Mistonium too.  Also, the "Full House" Collection awards 50( or 25?) currency.
---
And on Dragonfall the Champtrain after the meta gives lots of motes.
---
As for Thunderhead Peaks, you can do the 2 metas, and then go into the dwarven treasure vault for another 5(?) currency.
---
Istan is by far the easiest.
---
Domain of Kourna just takes some time, but you get a good amount of currency from the meta, and it has a relatively short cycle.
---
The Difluorite crystals are probably the hardest, but you can do the 2 metas, and hearts are relatively easily done.
---
Well, this video basically is a roast. He just kept it professional.
---
I love how two different replies to this cite as proof of A-net's bar cheating:
---
&gt; You'd think the rate would be faster at the start and the end, or that the goal might not be reached, but that never happens.
---
...and...
---
&gt; It moved much more towards the end of the volatile magic event...
---
So, there you have it. If the bar moves faster at the end, it proves A-net is cheating, whereas if the bar does not move faster at the end, it proves A-net is cheating! lol

https://mein-mmo.de/spieler-guild-wars-2-wandern-zu-final-fantasy-xiv/ the articel
---
&gt; some classes may have a few builds with the same base stats but different sigils, but it's pretty rare
---
At least within fractals sigil swapping is beneficial enough that some players carry multiple identical weapons (except for sigil) and others heavily prioritize getting legendaries. I guess this is an argument that legendary sigils should cost about what an ascended weapon does (~50g) to be appealing to this group.
---
Rune swapping isn't as common but does happen, although usually it's alongside a spec change so people typically carry two sets of armor. 
---
For raids:
---
Some Power builds at least benefit from being able to swap between scholar and thief (and sometimes eagle) with the same base gear (sometimes +/- assassin pieces) depending on subgroup composition and the mechanics of a particular fight. Power Bannerslaves are probably the ones who most benefit from this but they're not the only build which would. 
---
I would expect that there are some condi builds that have similar considerations between, say, baelfire and nightmare (e.g. condi renegade).
---
This is like, super diminishing returns mind, probably 1-2% dps differences. But at the point where the lowest hanging fruit is "alternative runes for the same build"  
---
How much is that worth? Not a lot of you already have full legendary armor. 
---
Maybe you're right that 50g is closer to the convenience ceiling on these. 
---
I don't think they'll cost that little though.
---
I see how you reason but i don't connect the dots. I mean i can buy a house that i want and live in it and pay a lot of money for it or i don't buy a house but rent a appartment and have more money left, i mean such is life, you make choices. 
---
There will always be choices and it is up to each person to decide what works for them. If it is the contract then go for that, if it is this new things then go for that.
---
You're neglecting the sick puppy! you bastard!
---
I got the email about 15 mins ago.
---
; \_ ;
---
The technology just is not there yet
---
\&gt;legendary upgrades have no visual effects.   
---
ok not interested lol
---
So according to this video, GW2 is in a bad place because it's too casual. But Wildstar died because it was too hardcore. Is it that hard to please every kind of player in an MMO?
---
Really? The first/one month I actually try for the automated tournaments?
---
Other mmos put shinies behind a timegated reward... progression items like ascended armor, experience. GW2 puts all rewards in the timegated reward and the normal reward is only a few silver, with only a few exceptions (SW, most prevalent) and those few exceptions ALL are only "press interact" on an object.
---
For fractal "farm" to be even remotely worth it, you have to run a very optimized setup and only 2 fractals work for this anyway. Just repeating fractals is not worth the time. You get more rewards just gathering wood and ore.
---
The problem in GW2 is the huge gap between timegated reward and reward on repeating. This turns the game into a timegated reward farm. Other mmos Ive played - am playing - dont punish you that hard for repeating content you like. If I repeatedly run random dungeons in ESO, I get less than the first time... yes... but its still "worth it". If I repeatedly run raids or daily fractals, Im hard pressed to even earn enough to buy food.
---
Horizontal progression the way anet realized it also means that to get your shinies in late endgame from the gemshop you need gold. So everything in this game is about gold/hour. Other mmos have gear progression, level progression and gold progression. So its more fanned out and not focused on gold progression. You get a handful of collection achievements in GW2 per year, but those are way too few - also they are mostly incredibly un-interactive, since you nearly always only run to a point somewhere, press interact and get to the next part. No dialogue, no combat. Unfun. Skyscale collection is the perfect example for this. The first 3 collections were HORRIBLE. The feeding and training was somewhat fun, but the rest, again, unfun.
---
Finally something tangible for endgame
---
I hope they get the cost just right, but I am honestly hyped for this and I also count it as communication
---
Can't wait and I hope my wallet doesn't suffer too much
---
He had a job lined up immediately after his departure, which is the same thing that happened with the other developers who left ArenaNet. Jon Peters left and immediately had a job at AGS; same thing happened with Grouch; same thing with Colin. They were poached by AGS, not fired by ArenaNet.
---
I got the email. Possible reasons why: I've never had my GW2 account banned, I tested GW2 beta, I played GW1 prior to GW2, I have some activity on the official forums, and I've spent a significant amount of money in the gem store.
---
Wasn't in this one. This one was about what you liked and disliked about the game. Your current goals, did you use the gem store, did you use currency exchange, what would you like in gem store, do you have friends who play the game, how do you meet other people in game, etc.
---
Nothing about the forum or website.
---
Rescheduled, can still try, extra time to practice
---
&gt;  to charr with episode 2 and the introduction of the Olmakhan. 
---
That was a bug. Have they made it official?
---
Does condi revenant have an easier rotation?
---
I gotta say I'm almost a complete opposite of you
---
Yeah...this isn't really happening..
---
Agreed, clearly the devs are out of touch with the community and need to be more involved. For starters they actually need to play their game, like make it mandatory for them to interact with people. Like don't log on with your flashy arena net logo and run around for 10 minutes and call it interaction. Actually try talking with some people.  It's getting to the point where it's not even a choice for them.  Every balance patch is a clear indication that they have no clue of what is going on. They can't even justify the changes they made properly and are hemorrhaging players. No one cares about their crappy zero effort gemstore promotions or legendary runes/sigils which are just terrible scams. Give people a reason to be excited and log in. Give people actually meaningful goals and challenges instead of trying to sugarcoat shit as actual content.
---
Clearly didn't even open the video
---
Optimistic view: maybe Anet is categorizing the playerbase into archetypes based on account stats, then they're doing random sampling within each archetype to find data for each type of gamer.
---
I only run virtues when i need to, i like shared signet too much.
---
(Same with tome cd, i only use it on mama and arts)
---
That'd be pretty interesting
---
And so much healthier for the game than only listening to whales :)
---
You keep using the word "timegated" and at this point I am convinced you just don't understand what it means. I've tried to offer explanation, but you seem convinced that any reward — regardless of how common it is — is timegated so long as it's included in any bonus chest.
---
Dungeon event !
---
1 chest for each story mode  
---
3 chest for each exploration mode
---
Only for first daily completion, like dungeon currency bonus
---
A lot of nice ideas !
---
Wait, wasn't [New World](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Game-Studios-New-World/dp/B07GB3ZV9M) the big one everyone was looking at by Amazon? Did something change regarding that?
---
The one that bugs me the most is axe skill 5. If it gets stuck it's just the most anytime sound ever. And I'm basically a giant walking rasengan until I log out.
---
Same.. but didn't get it.
---
I always type "Hi" or sth similar first, wait for the commander to show any sign of activity and start spamming their requestet killproof afterwards. Didn't get kicked once for typing "Hi" and waiting a bit.
---
Really? I always do west, it's less annoying than the turrets and less frustrating than watching people swat the bomb everywhere... while still maintaining my dignity of not being East.
---
I’m one of those people that quit a few months after w6 launch, came back for w7, got my CM title in 3 days then quit again. Everything in that video is 100% accurate of me. I didn’t burnout, I just dont have any hope for the game anymore.
---
In contrast, I’ve started playing another game. A game with a passionate studio behind it that announced a new expansion and systems overhaul coming in September. A studio that communicates with their community **every single week.** That fact alone gives me hope that there’s something to look forward to and that’s what keeps me playing.
---
I mean, everyone has their opinions, but what can someone who only does open world with a random build and don't know half the skills of their main class tell you about end-game, balance, pvp, wvw and whatnot?
---
I think the tone and bickering might be the bigger reasons people downvote.
---
My favorite explanation:
---
Time gating is when you can't no life something for a week and then complain that there's nothing to do.
---
Considering how gw2 has horizontal progression focused on gold/hour what you call "bonus chests" IS actually timegating content. Especially when looking at the huge gap between whats in the bonus chest, and what you get for "normally" doing things.
---
So, no, sorry. But you are the one using that expression wrongly.
---
Perhaps we had different surveys because I had text boxes following almost every question. I had ample opportunity to explain each of my choices.
---
Not all of that here but some. I had all gw1 games, beta tester, early access for GW2, some forum activity, but I've only spent a bit in the store (once in awhile I'll buy something, but can't say it's a significant amount)
---
Have not got a survey
---
&gt; mounts have made WvW roaming incredibly unfun,
---
If all i did was roaming, then what does that make the game.
---
I mean it's ran pretty flawlessly until now, and they are making up for it too.
---
What else could they do to actually make you pleased?
---
Different studios. Ex ANet devs are all in Seattle working on Crucible as far as we know. New World is a studio in LA I think.
---
Dragonfall is pretty time in terms of gameplay tho the theme of the map and the map visually are great.
---
Good job on breaking the rules.
---
leak all the questions pls
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Oh boy, that looks like an ambitious concept for a game.
---
I have a feeling Legendary Runes will also be heavily timegated. I doubt you'll be able to craft a full set straight away.  It will probably be like crafting Celestial gear. 
---
Swing and a miss ANET.
---
They want to know about the whole game, not just things relevant to hardcore players. You just answer the sections that are relevant to you. This isn’t a survey about only those things

I know about both of those, I was just wondering how the pve aspect of the game is for those with experience in Condi and power SB. Which is more enjoyable, etc.
---
Yeah I know of the connections to Mordremoth, but I left everything Mordremoth out because that's a whole nother story, and a whole nother BBEG for that matter. I didn't want a simple race homebrew to include a whole new faction of bad guys.
---
Yup it will really make templates not nearly as useful if they eventually release them. They really should have given the switching capability to ascended items but it's probably way too late now.

well grouch aint dead, but rip any hardcore scenes after he left.

Oh man, PANIC! spilled over to Reddit?

if its a question about a topic they have no idea of and give out statements / their opinion, then yes, they do not have a worthwhile opinions. its basically useless data which maybe get used and then shit goes on.  
---
if you want an example, here you go:  
---
player x has never done any raid apart from one single training which failed horribly because the whole group didn't prepare, the communication between players where non existant and nobody got whats going on.  
---
the question is: to you think raids are too hard?  
---
answer from said player x is: yes, raids are too hard. i only failed.  
---
....how is this useful information? how is this a "worthwhile opinion"?  
---
do you know how anet funnels in statistics to said player and sees: oh this guy did raids only once.  
---
how do you filter out complete trolling because you mailed some player which is just mad AF and he keeps on writing some weird shit?  
---
surveys are only good for certain parts of the game. like: do you think the prices in our ingame shop are okay?  
---
...in general this survey comes to a really weird time, as if they react to reddit drama by sending out surveys to the whole world.
---
Each one of these things are looking to go for about 1k each (and rising) with current costs, unless they also introduce ways to get needed materials.
---
As far as swapping runes go, take a look at that UI, that doesn’t look any easier scrolling through 100 options as opposed to like, 4 clicks for each one
---
2016 called, they want you back...
---
Octo meta doesnt fail anymore bro!
---
Long exposure.
---
Careful, that can get you arrested
---
Except this has nothing to do with the current reddit drama, They've been doing this for quite some time now but seems to be a selective thing.
---
If I remember correctly I've gotten two of those, before War Eternal and a few weeks after, then some time ago there was a post here in reddit about another type of survey which I didn't get but some people did.
---
Just finished the survey. Hopefully, they share thecresulting metrics
---
A time gate in gaming is when there is a halt to progress or access that can only be passed by waiting for a period of time to pass. It's a borrowed concept from engineering where you have a circuit that gives an output only during programmed intervals of time.
---
I don't know where you heard / came up with that other one, but that really is not what a time gate is. 
---
So, yes, there is a "time gate" in essence on the bonus chests, there is not a time gate on acquisition of the items you were talking about beyond a few key examples like Charged Quartz Crystals (at least at a reasonable rate of acquisition) or certain collections like the Skyscale. Aside from your brief mention of the skyscale, all of the examples you gave are things you can in fact nolife grind to your heart's content.

I think Nike is a bit off the mark as it relates to the reaction to HoT, but maybe what he's saying is how Anet perceived it. HoT was not particularly player friendly when it released; the maps were a mess, masteries took forever to unlock (per character), the metas were *very* strict, player builds were not nearly as good as they are now and some of it *was* too difficult (primarily Hero Points). HoT at launch was not nearly as good as it was following the HoT 2.0 update, but that also included the biggest content drought the game had seen. So maybe people were a bit harsh on HoT at launch, but it wasn't exactly without reason. HoT in its current state is excellent, but that makes it easy to look back and think it wasn't as bad as people said at the time.

Horizontal progression means you don't have to get your gear.  But good luck playing catch up with the **mastery system** when content begins to get real old.  For core, you'll want season 2 to get those points locked behind the story achievements or deal with farming the open world.   You need 49 points to max out core, another 144 to max out HoT, and another 102 to max out PoF for a total of 295 points.  This doesn't even account for having to deal with farming millions of EXP.  You skip out a few seasons, and you're behind via Mastery . Sure your gear is just fine, but good luck doing fractals without fractal attunement, or some raids without certain masteries such as ley-line gliding or jackal portals.
---
Now we have everything swappable for build templates:-D
---
I mean I would still recommend the game to someone who has never played it. It’s a great game no doubt. Thing is I’ve played since a month after launch. 7 years is a long time, and I can tell you right now the game does not have 7 years worth of content. The issue is long term and player retention. It’s not a one off single player like Skyrim or the Witcher. It’s an MMO and should function like one.
---
Lol is this troll? What’s wrong with female streamers?
---
Hope they actually take time to listen to the playerbase, it's a common tactic of enterprises to release surveys to cool things down without really taking them into consideration, just a placebo.
---
I think the last point about Anet surrendering some form of control to the community is a big one and is blatantly highlighted by what happened at PoF's launch. The community came together and really pushed GW2 forward leading up to that expansion and there was so much momentum in their favor and they really did absolutely nothing about it. They released PoF, everyone played through it and they just let all of that momentum die thinking that the Living Story would carry the game forward. The Living Story isn't what Anet thinks it is and that's part of the problem.
---
You don't get one if your a veteran with over 10k hours and not spending money on gems. Prove me wrong! 
---
on a serious note tough: I don't get why not all people get the survey?
---
I get that others don't feel the same and i guess my sentiment comes from my opinion about most content. Most content is just boring. You want a title? Have fun repeating the same stuff over and over, or spending multiple months without feeling any kind of progression until completion. Alot of that content also just isn't very interacting or fun to do (e.g. Farming snowberries). The same is true for alot of other GW2 content.
---
Meanwhile, I can enjoy GW1 still to this day. I have no idea why I can enjoy GW1 longer than GW2, I guess nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
---
If you want the most DPS you can get, you run berserker's stats and take the Soul Eater trait instead of Decimate Defences. You don't need marauder's stats for instanced content, because you should be able to rely on your team to help you survive and they should be able to rely on your damage. Reapers soak up enough damage with their shroud that you'll be able to mow through most open world content without feeling overly threatened.
---
Better from a role-playing perspective something I have felt with Living Story is I am an outsider just watching. Gw1 I really felt involved.
---
In-game hit escape, report a bug, list the skin, gender, race, describe the issue, hit the button at the bottom to include a screenshot.
---
I've been actually doing this before, prepared chatcodes for KPs for wings 2-4 (I just say The Eternal title on w1) because I cant be bothered finding what toon they are on as a multiclass raider. Also because I've been deleting or depositing them on bank.
---
They just don’t actually know what they want to do. Like what THEY want with the game. It’s like they are trying to always gauge what they should do based on flawed logic rather than just sitting down and saying what makes a game good.
---
You are missing the point. OP's point is that every other legendary in the game is not an investment. Say for example I need 10 axe configurations, berserker/assassins for 5 different sigils. I could spend 2000g for a legendary... or 200 gold crafting 10 different axes. Crafting a legendary is very obviously not gold-efficient, so saying "it won't be worth from a gold PoV" doesn't mean much
---
This is why difficulty modes are necessary, or raids will just die. You can't have the same content cater to casuals and hardcores, you need to split difficulty, or you'll always alienate one of the two sides; or more often, just both of them.
---
To think they killed the raid teams to save dead game modes (which they didn't even get to save) is depressing as fuck.
---
Very true, most of those games are dead, dying or... *battle for azeroth*..
---
man I have fond memories of Wildstar though.
---
**"I'm not burnt out, and I'm not tired of the game, but I am out of hope."** The last 3/4ths of the video spoke volumes, and I think Nike gave some great insight on the Amazon poaching.  GW2's engine is ancient and I don't think it's easy for them to maintain.  They definitely lost a lot of talent and behind the scenes value, and I don't think they'll recover their pace quite frankly.

If you want some examples of "good" community outreach and proactive social media usage see Path of Exile's community manager: 
---
She goes by the name, "Bex_GGG" and is instrumental at building excitement, hope and inspiriting curiosity in their new community.  Even in her [comment section on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/user/Bex_GGG/comments/) you get all sorts of reaction gifs, memes and wholesome interactions.  Then you have her submitted content section where players get *random* patch previews of [various snippets.](https://old.reddit.com/user/Bex_GGG/submitted/)

I'm in my late 20's and ArenaNet really doesn't seem to understand social media's ability to generate excitement and hope.  It feels a lot like when parents or my grandparents try to use it; post random status updates and hope for the best.  Surprisingly, I'm actually not a huge fan of social media, but Reddit &amp; Twitter are amongst the best free advertising campaign you could ever hope for.  I mean, if Wendy's can do it what is the excuse, really? [ GGG is at ~ 120 devs and they're doing great.

This is an Indie company from New Zealand that makes an aRPG/Dungeon Crawler; "Path of Exile."  If you thought of something like Grim Dawn or Diablo II or Diablo III then you're pretty much on the right track.  They've been wildly successful, and Chris Wilson's presentation at the GDC [\(Game Developer's Conference\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_5S55jUzk) is probably one of the most interesting, relatable and relevant gaming presentations that I've ever seen.  It's quick paced, insightful and intriguing, but it an hour long.
---
Yeah that does make sense. I enjoy the story but I have absolutely no emotional investmemt in any of the characters. When Eir died I didn't care. When Aurene "died" I again, didn't care.
---
Meanwhile Master Togo's death fucked child me up and it still stays impactful to this day. Kormir becoming a goddess had me hyped up.
