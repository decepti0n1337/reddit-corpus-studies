Are we really complaining about Ad spaces on sites now?

&gt; a dragon race on Tyria
---

---
I would think so, yes. For one there are the salt spray dragons in Cantha, of which Kuunavang is one. Theres also Albax, another salt spray dragon. Both can speak.
---
In central Tyria there are bone dragons, the decayed remains of ancient dragons that once roamed Tyria and were ressurected by the Lich.
---
There is more than plenty evidence that dragons once roamed freely on Tyria long before the gods arrived and brought humanity with them.
---
Probably long before any of the other elder races.
---
&gt; could ANYTHING become an Elder Dragon
---
No. Heavily implied that that is not the case. Theyre called Elder DRAGONs for a reason. When a human absorbed enough magic they didnt become an Elder Dragon but a god instead.
---
All living creatures without an innate ability to consume magic and store it go insane and eventually just die.
---
Even the Commander started to go crazy for a time before they managed to cure their intoxication. (This was the focus of the anomaly side story) And in states of chaos, magic can be potentially deadly by just touching it which is why Aurene shares her powers with the Commander which allows them to absorb the volatile magic that is now present in the world (mechanically only in LWS 4 maps)
---
The AB meta map runs was my first taste of public full map participation in HoT. I was blown away how everyone coordinated and made it happen without having to be in one guild or on voice chat.
---
Then I zoned into Dragon Stand and that raised the notch even higher
---
where is the  vloud in 22?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or tattoo it under your armpit.
---
Or all three!
---
Why not? Zhaitan had them. It could also be armor fitted on her. Its not implausible.
---
Did you talk to the stump? You can test to make sure you have the song by leaving the hut and playing the song right outside it. If a face doesn't appear on the rock wall next to it then it didn't work. 
---
That is not possible, since it's impossible to keep players in all objectives at all times.  WvW can't be stripped of PvE because it's intrinsic to it by its very nature.  WvW is both PvE and PvP, and it cannot exist without both as it is.  
---
You can't replace a NPCs with players, for example. Even if you had a way to take over the role of a lord, giving the player lord health and power or something like that, then that would be exploitable by 'spies', allowing them to get themselves killed easily by their friends on the enemy team.   
---
NPCs have fixed behaviors, so they are also a way to control some of the rules of the game.  
---
The problem isn't having more or less PvE in WvW. It's how that PvE is done.  
---
If it's not done right, then it isn't that different from an event in any PvE map, and pretty much a pointless nuisance.   
---
I can't say I'm fond of the 'musical chairs' game that happens sometimes that makes players avoid each other and focus on capturing enemy objectives to farm WXP, hardly ever defending anything but keeps. That's also another kind of pure PvE nonsense we need to discourage.    
---
But if this added PvE is done well, you can actually get more PvP, as contradictory as that may sound, if it's done in a way that willl encourage players to spread across the map and bring them together to the same objectives, which would in turn cause more PvP.  
---
For example, there could be Bounties that players can take that give bonus rewards for taking or defending a location.  
---
Each map could get a set of 5 bounties at any given time, and only a fixed number of players would be able to take each. At one time the Bounty NPC of two the the teams could give a bounty to up to 20 players to take a tower, while the NPC of the 3rd team would give a bounty to defend it, and so we'll likely have players from 3 teams gathering at that tower for some fun fighting. Another bounty could be given only to up to 5 players, and send them to a camp, another for a single player, and send them to a sentry and have a smaller scale fight.   
---
If bounties are timed and they can't be taken consecutively by the same group, and give juicy amounts of warscore, then we would not have zergs taking turns with each bounty, they'll have to choose and spread or they'll get less warscore than enemy teams if they do spread.
---
Another example of more PvP by adding more PvE would be having a 4th NPC faction (for example, Aetherblades) that will take any objective players leave undefended for too long, returning it to the gray team.  Give each supply line from a camp to a keep a meta-event that rewards capture and defense against other players and the 4th faction.   
---
Sticking around a supply route scouting and escorting dolyaks is horribly boring for most players, since there's usually not much to do if no players come around, and if they come, it's often large zergs.  Have NPCs attacking it every now and then, and that'll break the monotony, so it'll be more likely that a few players would stick around each supply route.   
---
Then you just need to make this 4th faction into cowards that will teleport away when there's more than 1 player faction around, leaving the fight to be between players only so they can focus on PvP.   
---
And of course there has to be better rewards for keeping all these supply lines, not just mostly on capture and pip-ticks. 
---
With more PvE added in a way like this, there would be more players spreading all over, and with an increased likelihood of having a player in any given location at any given time, in turn when other players get to those locations, it'll be more likely they'll meat each other and fight.  
---
Then you could even have a Mercenary system that allows players to join this 4th faction and enter maps outside their match instead going to the Edge of the Mists when all of their maps are full, or maybe even join teams of you own color in different matches when they are outnumbered. 
---
We have to be realist. PvE will never, ever leave WvW. But it doesn't have to be boring, and it can be done in a way that actually encourages PvP.  The difficult part is figuring out ways to do so. But there's definitely ways. 
---
I don't see Druids topping anything above 90% otherwise I'd have a better uptime of Sholarrune in my combatloggs.

---
Not being a WoW player, I decided to look up the Deathwing fight after seeing multiple people bring it up here. TBH, watching that, it felt like a complete version of the Zhaitan fight. Battling dragons and minions on a giant airship full of turrets, using a giant magical laser beam to bring down the dragon. Then with two different phases of fighting on the dragon's back in the sky and attacking it after it got brought down.
---
Makes me feel like if ArenaNet had the time needed to finish the Zhaitan fight, we would have gotten something along the lines of Deathwing.
---
I rather not have a "Zhaitan fight 2.0" tbh. Even if it got the epicness Zhaitan's fight deserved.
---
He just wanted a hug 
---
I agree we can't go from our "child" dying to being able to killing one of the most dangerous, evil being with powers of 2 fallen dragons and a fallen god. I'm hoping we lose worse next time.
---
I am sorry but your arguements is nothing i feel i can even try to argue because i have not yet met anyone in WvW who play it as their game mode who want more PvE in WvW. It just feels like we are on two different planets. 
---
I appreciate the time you took to answer though but i can not really do anything else but this.
---
Love the guitar in this song
---
Season 2 was really slow pace actually, and I liked it a lot. Seasons 3 and 4 have been face paced for sure (overly so, in my opinion). That said, given that it takes months to get an episode, i understand why they have chosen this pacing.
---
Have you tried un- and reinstalling it? Verified the files? Is there any difference between the accounts, like is one running it as admin and the other isn't? Any recent software updates? Hardware? Anything?
---
You gotta give us a bit more to work with here.
---
Shit, i thought he only spoke for 9 out of 10. But all of them? Well, guess he's right about everything then.
---
Good.
---
Hmm, no idea then. But maybe you pass the cloud path, if you take a friend with a "working flute" with you.
---
I got this as well. I was a little concerned something was up with my account because I already have 2-factor authentication enabled and I shouldn't be getting any requests to validate my email, so I opened a support ticket. I think it may have been a bug on their end, but they fixed it and now I don't get the message anymore. If it hasn't cleared up on its own for you, maybe contact support and see if they can help.
---
It could be a new flying mount which allows ascending mid-air rather than gliding.
---
I wanted a 1 hour video tbh
---
Can't you just learn the "Shatter song" on the flute and basically skip that whole section (break the final icicle immediately)?
---

---
It's made out of big chunks of solid sugar, tinted in purple. She wanted bigger crystal like Kralk has in it's back but wasn't able to make or find large pieces of it. 
---
It's Aurene returned, don't forget she devoured Joko the Undying and absorbed his magic.
---
Nope. We haven't even got the trailer. What releases was a 20 second teaser Arenanet showed off at the end of a panel they did at a gaming expo about death in games narrative.
---
**After** SAB, we will have a small open world update like the bandit leaders and the Joko invasions. And then some time **after that** we will have Episode 6. The earliest possible date is April 30, though even that is probably overly hopeful.
---
I've been actually having more problems lately. Even with power creep, I think it's that there are less people doing it outside the reset window.
---
For the skins, yes. The mastery point is only the first time you complete that level block though. Doing the other orders after the first won't grant any mastery points.
---
I feel for you, I am uncomfortable with heights more than normal too.
---
But the game really can't make decisions based on that. Pick any creature and environment and there is at least one person who a legitimate fear of it.
---
What do you mean
---
Don't be so rude, Alex.
---
Thats big brain
---
I did this with Eyes of Kormir when they hit vendor price and then had them choking up all my storage for a year.

I love spoopycat so much, but it's just so tiny. My Charr look like they're crushing it.
---
Welp I just can't do that W D jump, I spent good 20 minutes on that jump alone to no avail :D
---
Or just make a bug report?...
---
If you wonder why some bugs take long to get fixed, it's because ppl don't give a sht about the intended way to report bugs and instead posting their bugs/exploit on reddit, showing other ppl how to abuse this bugs and leeching karma. 
---
No, making a reddit post is *no* official bug report and is barely seen by Anet workers. Upvoting don't change anything, just make a bug report...
---
Hey so for support chrono in fractal (t3/4), should I gear assassin armor with rune of pact (metabattle) or diviner armor with rune of eagle (discretize) or perhaps something else? Appreciate an explanation if you could spare the time :)
---
Please quote me on the part I mention skins and achievements. 
---
Instead of your gear getting better, why don't **you** get better?
---
I agree with you 100%. Anet said from the beginning they were focused on creating a living breathing world and put most of their resources into it. That's not to say PVP couldn't have been bigger. It wasn't the aim of the devs...not even in the beginning. 
---
Just the fact that it had one single SPvP mode for the longest time is enough to convince me that Anet believed PvE to be the way forward from Guild Wars 1. 
---
We even saw this trend at the end of Guild Wars 1 were most updates were PvE updates.  Guild Wars 1 started as a game that was intended as a PvP end game, but as the game progressed, the population must have leaned to PvE content or we'd have a different story today.
---
Have you reported this in an official way or only posted it here to leech karma?...
---
You mean around the rock to the checkpoint? I can't do that jump either but I'm confused as to how you get to the top of the walls if you actually touch the checkpoint?
---
Stop! My wallet can only get this errect!
---
&gt; One bug report is likely to be less effective than one hot post on reddit, unless you take the time to get a solid amount of evidence and send a ticket in which takes a lot more effort than giving a quick +1.
---
It's just random if the right employee look at the right post at the right time. It's absolutely not like they observe this subreddit all the time, at all. Thinking that a reddit post would be more effective than an official bug report is just wrong. It gets seen by more user, so more user deciding to report this bug, because noone else do, *that* is what those reddit posts are good for, not "Anet see all hot bug posts".
---
Sure, giving +1 is much less effort, also it's much less effective. 
---
And just by the way, even this subreddit say, that we should reports bugs and exploits in an official way...
---
&gt;Post exploits. If you happen to find an exploit send details and evidence about it to exploits@arena.net
---
Not to mention that also Anet Ben said that we should report exploits/bugs in official ways and NOT post them online, which could motivate other players to use these bugs and exploits. 
---
That's one of the worst parts of the level lol
---
You clearly overestimate the in game big report system. 
---
I feel like that dude is projecting hardcore. 
---
Someone should go befriend him, he sounds miserable. 
---
Is path of exile worth trying for someone bored with gw2?
---
But they don't. No SAB requires dodgejumps at all. 
---
Dodgejumps is only needed for skips, not for the intended ways. And imo, if you want to use these skips, you should be able to do them -&gt; learn to use dodgejumps. You (actually OP) should not demand that Anet help players to use player-made tricks/skips. Being able and allowed to use dodgejumps and these skips should be help enough. 
---
Additional to this: The fastest ways/skips in W1 Z1, 2 and 3 don't even require dodgejumps.
---
Could it be a cry for help? Maybe? I'll add him :)
---
If you jump/dodge/move or got knocked back/stunned during while casting a certain skill, it will be interrupted and have to wait about 3-5 seconds to cast it again. 
---
Some other skills end up going full cd like the ranger axe 5 on interrupt, such a party pooper some mobs could be.
---
Dodgejumps is only needed for skips, not for the intended ways. And imo, if you want to use these skips, you should be able to do them -&gt; learn to use dodgejumps. You should not demand Anet to help with not intended tricks. Being able and allowed to use dodgejumps and these skips should be help enough. 
---
It's strategically used for more than just SAB, maybe I should have omitted that from my title so that it wouldn't be focused on so heavily.
---
Well yeah, but they seem to know about them now. They could've had prior knowledge of similar beings from their world (that they replaced), without being aware that such roles would also be filled on Tyria.
---
Because we don’t like starting every game from scratch (Dota2 player here). 
---
I for one enjoy seeing my toons decked in legendaries. 
---
With your logic then the fact that they made multiple routes to go about doing something, like for example some of the splits in w2z2 trib, means I'm skipping part of the content literally no matter what because I can only go one path at a time.
---
Also RNG != difficulty, there is again **no skill whatsoever** in pressing two buttons on a keyboard simultaneously.
---
&gt; I'm not sure you read what I typed. There is nothing whatsoever for me to learn, it is literally just random inconsistencies where one of the two inputs is ignored. I have tested it both manually and with macros using every single millisecond ranging between 0 and 100 and no matter what, there are still inconsistencies.
---
I don't know. I personally have a 99% success rate by pressing space+v with my thumb, even with a high ping. And you also said that some friends can do it 90% of the time. 
---
It's may different from player to player, but I think it's still learnable.
---
Also keep in mind that dodgejumps are actually bugs, at least an unintended occurrence. It's tolerated by Anet, because they like what players make out of it and it's not that gamebreaking, but the don't support it. 
---
All in all, it's just an unintended occurrence. 
---
The amount of emotion you have invested here, I’ll just let it go to save you the stress, dude. 
---
&gt; Dodgejumps is only needed for skips
---
Isn’t it mandatory at the beginning of W2Z2 to get ontop of the leaves?
---
when awareness is raised, they get more pressure to fix things. we all know they don't fix stuff you just report in game quietly. 
---
Perhaps Fractals are more of your thing because of the random Instabilities everyday, even more so when you pug the dailies. 
---
People generally view pugging fractals in a bad light but I really like it. I meet new people everyday, there’s no stress because I’m exp enough to multiclass depending on what the party needed. 
---
I’m not exp in raids, but the few runs I’ve joined I was top two dps. I actually find Raids to be easier than fractals, I just can’t dedicate the time for 10 man content. Which is a shame. 
---
If this person is a law student, then they must surely be aware that the market is saturated with lawyers, and that job prospects from non-top tier law firms are relatively bleak. Law programs are also professional programs and therefore do not qualify for financial aid, so unless this person's parents are wealthy, they're financing it on student loans. Many law grads can only find jobs in their field that make around $40-$50,000 post graduation, which is not enough to pay off $150,000 - $200,000 in student loans. Assistant managers at Walgreens (in my hometown) make more than that. Cashiers at Costco might make about that. 
---
It's also possible that this person is actually a morbidly obese neckbeard taking a law course at Cappella university online and thinks that's the same thing. 
---
i'll ask what i always think when i see these kinds of posts.... did you buy a crapload of cauliflower hoping to spike the price and make a quick buck out of speculators? are people not noticing it enough to give you a profit so you are making a reddit post in hopes of making it happen that way by pretending to give us a tip?
---
Well, I usually ignore them but he was pushing it very far. 
---
That's not a teaser , that's nothing.
---
sorry to hear that man. lost my doggo in 2015, still keeps his leash with me. :(
---
I don't know why this wasn't more of an obvious idea earlier, but something about this teaser really smacks me in the face with the idea that this is what's going to happen:
---
* We will go to the Mists to fight Kralkatorrik there.
---
* We will have the help of all of our lost comrades (or as many as they can get the voice actors for): Traehern, Eir, Blish, Snaff, Aurene of course, I suppose Vlast, and whoever else I'm forgetting. Maybe even Glint. 
---
Altogether, this ending solves a number of problems that have been developing with the story, including some which I seem to recall WP discussing in a video. 
---
* First, because Aurene is actually dead it means that they don't need to have some convoluted reason she can't be around to help with whatever problem we are facing at any given time. Having a dragon - especially an Elder Dragon - as a BFF really does make just about everything trivial and as she got more and more powerful it was going to become more and more silly. 
---
* Especially if she were to absorb all of Kralkatorrik's magic, as has been expected, and so were to become as powerful as an Elder Dragon AND a god AND an immortal lich all at the same time, there's just no way to create meaningful conflict with that kind of power on your side.
---
* However, because she helps us in the battle in the mists, and of course will likely be the key to victory and of course absorb all that magic in the end, it avoids the pretty significant writing/narrative problem with building up this one central arc and character for four years and then just having her die and saying, "well, I guess that was a waste of time let's try something else." 
---
* Also, because we have this long established, but still rare, ability for characters to travel - at least temporarily - back and forth from the Mists, it means that Aurene is always there as an option if they want to do something with her. 
---
* Additionally, they can draw on the Revenant lore and let the commander have some kind of lasting "gift" from Aurene: we can get some kind of power or ability or whatever which is not as OP as having an Elder Dragon-god-lich on your side constantly, but which still feels like Aurene's impact on the Commander lasts beyond the end of the story. 
---
no. this clip shows basically nothing , and the above is all speculation.
---
Discretize’s build is technically more optimal. The actual DPS difference between the two is pretty negligible if you’re not min-maxing. Whichever you choose, make sure you reach 85% boon duration from your equipment and food (which will become 100% with the fractal pots).
---
My personal preference is taking pack runes for the perma swiftness. Pack runes is also better to have if you ever plan on doing raids in the future.
---
Yes
---
"And after the defeat of the rebel scum, King Joko roared a mighty crescendo, and his essence refilled the rivers to overflowing, and to this day those rivers remain bountiful." -Ventidi Academy Scholar, probably
---
You could try Ambrite weapons, actually, but I am not sure you will like them, they are... different.
---
Awww! Ramona was my bun, I'm so honored people love her as much I do. I would love to dye my springer in remembrance of your beloved Connie as well, would that be okay? :')
---
&gt;  If he werent gravely injured, do you really think he would have just LEFT after killing Aurene? 
---
Yup. He's obviously bleeding energy out of his eye. Maybe even from those little plumes WP pointed out as well. 
---
&gt;No, you hunt it down and finish it off.
---
Unless the devs throw us a big curve ball like having the Commander sitting in their home instance getting drunk for three chapters while Taimi dies off screen I think a roaring rampage of revenge is exactly how the season should finish.
---
You forgot Caudecus. But I guess that speaks enough for his involvement. 
---
Yup, Early HoT era Dragon's Stand was an epic experience
---
Or maybe the map is in the mists?
---
Sorry, but I have to disagree. If you are going for Quickbrand/Alacrev combo, it's always the rev who should be the healer and not the firebrand. The reason being the rev having far less damage than the firebrand while at the same time a dps-variant of the quickbrand can equally provide aegis for the group which allows the group to ignore/skip certain boss-attacks. 
---
While the current "meta" for fractals does not run any healer at all, I can understand why certain groups want to bring a healer. In that sense the druid is the most offensive variant, healing while providing Spirit buff, Glyph of Empowerment during bust phases and Spotter (which is important in groups that do not run below 180 AR) this also comes with a few strong CCs. 
---
When it comes to heal-per-second. the heal firebrand loses to both healscrapper (which comes with alot of easy, non-blast-required skipping and stealthing abilities) and healrevenant and healtempest. While this is just my personal opinion but if you are running something other than druid, you might aswell run the Firebrand/Rev combo with the Rev being the healer, not the firebrand.  
---
Two possibilities I'm calling now.
---
1. It's a rental mount for players who haven't unlocked the griffon so they can fly around by Kralk and do what's required of them by the story.
---
2. Aurene is returning and we'll get to fly her in the open world. Since there can't be x-thousand Aurenes, this mount will be what other players see.
---
I can see it all now. A shrewd businesscharr with too much money on his paws bought a ton of cauliflower to artificially manipulate the supply and demand using meme culture and herd mentality in the wake of the 500 cooking announcement. In addition they've hired you u/[OdinMinusNull](https://www.reddit.com/user/OdinMinusNull) to keep cauliflower in the public eye to further drive prices up. And when it reaches peak meme they will sell at a huge profit. Brilliant. Only a Charr would be so devious. 
---
I've long speculated that there was a dragon race, perhaps of "types" like typical of fantasy (Crystal, dark, fire, ice, planty, sea, so on), but the elder dragons started killing or corrupting all of their kin, leaving only the elder dragon in question as well as their minions.
---
I really formed this because Glint is described as "regaining her free will" but that her "body remained crystalline", as well as her two children Vlast and Aurene being not solid crystal or crystal and rock (Like Glint, Kralk, or the shatterer dragon champion type body), but instead flesh and scales, with crystals growing from their bodies.
---
We're starved for content? Me in-game to-do list is laughing at you.
---
I mean, they DID say that the roadmap was not a complete list.
---
You can't spell cantha without "HA" and "Can't"
---
Agree wholeheartedly!
---
I wish there was a mini game which involved those mini's. Collect them, fuse them to increase powers and add abilities, and use them to fight each other in a mini fight club. Like with the raptor mount mini but with fighting. That way you could justify their existence in such high numbers.
---
It would feel natural to me. He's in bad shape now would be the time to keep the pressure up.
---
Wrong. You love it
---
thats basically how the price and supply graph of any cooking material looks like this week...
---
Connie will live forever in the Mists
---
I have a classmate who plays in the highest tiers of pvp, and he and his friend ( i do not know said other friend ) deliberately tank their MMR because they cannot play together once they get so high up, because the system no longer allows you to queue together. 
---
So yeah, basically told me straight to my face that he deliberately bombs his own stats.
---
bitter person without any cauliflower in the material storage identified
---
"rng"
---
As pretty much everything in SAB is character-bound, I suggest using the same single character, who isn't buffed up with Item, XP, Birthday, or Celebration Boosters.
---
You can actually go over 12 seconds of reflection. Overload Earth (4s), Sand Squall (4s), Aftershock (4s), Rebound in earth (4s), and then you're getting close to your next overload.
---
If you happened to be out of combat I guess you could swap to staff for earth skill 3? lol
---
“Two to three” more episodes would mean kralks death in episode 2 or 3 in the season 5 of living world. That very much implies that there will be “nothing but brand maps until then” 
---
If you aren't trying to rush to the end of the story it may be fun to all pick different ones. 
---
Anets already stated that the season 4 maps will “take place inside of Tyria” .. meaning no new maps in the mists. The new teaser really makes me feel like my original comment towards finally killing kralk will come true :) hopefully 
---
Agree 100%, would just mention that dT hasn't been updated for the banner nerf so they may change things a tiny bit when they optimize again.
---
I decided to browse through that subreddit, it's all somehow even lower quality than OP's.
---
After browsing that sub reddit, I've come to the conclusion it requires the mental maturity of an edgy 13 year old to find funny.
---
I agree with you if you are outnumbered there's no point in fight, but if you can find a skirmish with a couple of players is still worth a try and even if you're death in less then ten seconds you can always read the chat to hunderstand what hit you to death, trying to do better next time.
---
Wait. First you say that dodgejumps are RNG, and you’re sick of the inconsistency, because of your personal experience. 
---
Then, you go on to say there’s no skill involved with pushing two buttons at the same time, so would like a dedicated keybind for dodge jump, even though based on this sentence, it’s not necessary because it doesn’t require skill. You’re on both ends of the spectrum here my dude. 
---
I land all of my dodge jumps. There’s no RNG about it. Even so, I read years ago that Anet won’t be adding a keybind for this, but they do allow a macro for it. 
---
The logos are blue
---
Blue = water

Water = underwater dragon
---
Conclusion: the expansion/living world is about Steve!
---
*hype train intensifies*
---
Was too lazy to check the name! Yes!
---
It could be a map/story specific mount and they could just sell a version of it as a griffon skin.
---
I wonder if that last bit is going to involve some fight on a griffin dragon mount against kralk? And maybe instead of it being a full fledged flying mount it will just incorporate the gravity gliding tech from Dwaynas Reliauary in Sirens Landing to keep the griffin airborn? I am pretty curious about where it is though. The roots on the cliff look very maguma.
---
You absolutely can be what you describe in your second paragraph and many people are. That is also a very valid gender identity and gender expression combination (that is touched on by the article but there are also many other sources that aren't behind paywalls discussing this topic). The reason why there "needs" to be a "new" gender norm is because that is how some people simply are and have been. That new being in scare quotes is very deliberate because these gender norms existed historically in a plethora of cultures (hijra, two spirits, followers of Hermaphroditus in ancient Greece) before Abrahamic religions, that are based firmly on a gender binary with the man being more important, became dominant. The gender norm that the authors call for on the basis of their findings isn't all that radical either. In the full paper they basically argue that their findings show that gender exists as a spectrum, nonbinary androgynous people exist, trans people exist, binary identifying people exist, some binary identifying individuals that have traits and feelings more like the other binary gender exist but won't transition and aren't nonbinary and we should take all of these valid ways of being into account. 
---
The practically infinite number of genders point is an interesting one. If there is a spectrum of gender identity and gender presentation then this is effectively the case but it shouldn't be confused with the genders that people will create on sites like nonbinary.org. Things like "cosmicgender" or "firegender" may diminish experiences of binary transgender people (because they are questionable user created experiences with no scientific backing and are better described as personalities) but gender existing as a spectrum doesn't at all.

Nonbinary people go through a similar, and often longer lasting, phase where they are identifably "trans". A binary trans person may end up cis passing eventually but that is unlikely for a nonbinary person who presents as androgynous to diminish gender dysphoria. Some nonbinary people may take hormone replacement therapy, just the same as trans people. Same with surgery, social transition, presenting differently, voice therapy, physiotherapy, relationship therapy and so on. For nonbinary people it might just mean missing out on one or two treatments (like genital reconstruction surgery for example) but conversely having more treatments in a different area so that gender dysphoria is resolved. Nonbinary individuals that can have their dysphoria treated by presenting in androgynous manner seem to be, thankfully, more common than someone that just wants to come up with their own gender for whatever reason. 
---
Which is currently a topic of much contention for both nonbinary and binary trans people. There are those that feel a diagnosis of gender dysphoria is an important aspect of being trans. There are those who are firmly against this. The former group is probably going to be a lot more offended by someone coming along, saying there are infinite genders and their gender is "cosmic gender" but they don't have dysphoria and won't be seeking any sort of treatment. That definitely can lead to possible animosity but that is going to be equally held by both nonbinary and binary trans people that have gone through a needed diagnosis and years of treatment to try to minimise gender dysphoria.
---
A quick point on terminology - you mentioned gender dysmorphia. The correct phrase is gender dysphoria. The related phrase you might have been thinking of is body dysmorphia. Gender dysphoria is related to gender and the most successful treatment for it is transitioning (though the number of treatments and changes needed will differ between individuals). Body dysmorphia is due to the perception that aspects of a person's body are flawed and this causes intense concerns regarding the flaw. However body dysmorphia isn't best treated by changing the body but rather selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy, more similar to unipolar depression. These treatments don't work for gender dysphoria.

I've talked too much again but thanks for the interesting points that you raised!

Its intended. 
---
Your wife did such a great job! That's a really cute cake!! 
---
&gt;but the moment you equip it over water the thing drowns and
---
transforms into a seahorse. 
---
As a fellow bun mom and GW2 participant, this is absolutely amazing! 
---
So what? 
---
Kudzu. It's beautiful. But what class actually uses longbows in a meaningful way? 
---
I wonder how flying would go over in Gw2...
---
Though if they were to add flying I'd prefer it to be a slower than griffon mode and lets us use our glider skins instead (sort of like a slow hover)
---
That's sad. I'd pity you but that'd be sadder.
---
&gt;explain to me how horizontal progression is a good thing and promotes content longevity.
---
No
---
&gt; or whatever category fishing falls into.
---
afk farming
---
Or you do it like me: Don't spec veil, but do all in your power to support your people. Distract enemies, help bomb, rez, daze. Don't let attitudes like those of some comms drag you down. Don't join squads if obviously not wanted, keep eyes open for those that do. Not every comm acts that entitled.

It's implied that the gods knew damn well that Zhaitan was sleeping under Arah the entire time.
---
They settled in Tyria with their humans with the help of the Forgotten. Forgotten who not only cleansed Glint of her dragon corruption in Arah but they also battled Zhaitan there together with the mursaat (and lost).
---
Glint wonders what the Forgotten told the gods in one of her voice recordings.
---
&gt; go back to WoW
---
Just save up the gold to go from 1-400  in one sitting
---
A lack of clear goals is indeed a problem that has caused a lot of my friends to quit the game. But gw2 is really not that type of game where everyone is forced to do the same stuff in order to progress. You can choose your own goals.
---
There's already post that someone asked just this week that has all the answers
---
People are just confused when they got no goals set by the game itself. For me i like it way more to choose what i want to work on, rather than have to grind my ass off every few months to do the new content. 
---
You could say the same for wvw
---
&gt; So why can't we just have an ingame keybind for it?
---
A dodge jump is used by the player to use shortcuts that you wouldn't be able to do with a regular jump. You don't have to use dodge jump to complete SAB even in tribulation mode. As I mentioned it is used for shortcuts and if you follow regular routes you don't need them at all.
---
But, with the tolerated macro usage I don't see why this is a problem at all.
---
And finally, it is not RNG because RNG is the same input with different output and when you are not pressing them in the correct period of time it just doesn't work.
---
In this picture, just under a year. When he died, a little over, AKA way too young to die. He was always sick, ever since he was a baby, so he was constantly very weak. One night I guess his little body just could’t take it anymore :(
---
I love jumping to conclusions when Cantha is involved!! xD
---
I remember not getting groups for dungeons in wow because everyone got their BiS already from there. Or not getting into Karazhan becaue people were done there.
---
If anything, vertical progression guarantuees content will become irrelevant quickly. Why do you think raids come out in wow on  a schedule? Or why bosses are on weekly lockouts?
---
Hey OP, explain to us how vertical progression is a good thing and promotes content longevity? [Hardmode challenge: grinding and timegating do not count as content longevity]
---
Vertical progression is repetitive grinding for gear. If you're not into gear grind, then no game for you. If you leave the game for a while, then you can't play with your friends until you grind up again. 
---
But if you like that, then cool for you. It's good that there's different types of games for different people. Have fun with whatever you like playing.

[They have the Issnur Longhair](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Issnur_Long_Hair) although its cheek fluff could be a bit longer.

Then play both. I threw a couple of builds together for you.

Support Firebrand: [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQRApe3ensADFBjNCD2DBkCjlHCL7EMfyA7zz7ZAFLA0A+AA-jhx/wAZeCAAOJAdV/htSwp6HOr8jUAONYD-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQRApe3ensADFBjNCD2DBkCjlHCL7EMfyA7zz7ZAFLA0A+AA-jhx/wAZeCAAOJAdV/htSwp6HOr8jUAONYD-e)
---
For this one, you can start out by mixing Cleric's and Magi's unless you're running raids, then try to avoid taking toughness which Cleric has. Food can be expensive so just start with what I've put in the build. Don't worry about min/maxing stats with food unless you're doing T4 Fractals or Raids and even then it's not necessary but it does help. Ultimately you'll want Concentration which increases Boon Duration and Healing Power which is kinda self-explanitory. As you acquire Ascended gear which you can get most easily and consistently through crafting imo though it can also be obtained through raids, collections, and fractals, you can start getting gear with both Concentration and Healing Power. You'll wanna try to go for Harrier's stats which has both Concentration and Boon duration. But if you can't, there are other options as well. As for Runes, you'll generally want to go Rune of The Monk anytime you're gearing a healer. Judging from all the Firebrand comments I'm seeing, I trust you kinda already know what this does. Block and heal essentially.
---
Blood Support Scourge: [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQFAWnk0AV3gt2AO9Cs9iluBb6BMACA690haSlqDsBOUA-jxxRQBR7CAQTdA2U9Hc9AAwpyvcqEEA7PQKAnGsB-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQFAWnk0AV3gt2AO9Cs9iluBb6BMACA690haSlqDsBOUA-jxxRQBR7CAQTdA2U9Hc9AAwpyvcqEEA7PQKAnGsB-e)
---
This one is less a healer than a defibrillating buttplug medic more than anything else really. You aren't going to put out massive healers and bring people back up from low HP in the blink of an eye like you would with burstier healers such as Druid, but the healing on this class is more consistent and sustained resulting in more healing throughout the fight. And not only that, but that healing when paired with barriers will help keep everyone topped off on HP which will ultimately result in smoother runs in both good groups and bad pug groups as a lot of people need to be at 90% HP or higher for a 10% damage bonus from Scholar Runes. 
---
However, this build shines in bad groups. It is the baby sitter. The hard carry. I will often run this in lieu of my Chrono. I know, that sounds insane. But hear me out. I am a Chrono main. And my biggest gripe with playing Chrono is people not being in my damn Wells when they go off or staying close for buffs as is the case with many other classes such as Druid, Firebrand, and other things often considered meta which Support Scourge is not. A lot of people who don't stack are often people new to the game or new to the content they're running and they're struggling with a mechanic that's preventing them from stacking assuming they don't know when and where to stack. A good group knows exactly where to be at what time and that's where the meta works. When players are inexperienced, the meta falls apart and people die. That is where Blood Scourge thrives. When people go down, you can group them all up easily and revive them all within a few seconds at the same time. 
---
I often run this at meta events and world bosses where people often go down. Quickness and Alacrity isn't going to help someone who's on the floor. But getting people up constantly who would otherwise just sit and AFK while dead is gonna do so much more for squad DPS than boons as not only are you preventing downed players from just going dead and "rez pls" followed by "omfg wp", you are also saving players who are actually doing work from having to walk back and you are doing it constantly through speedy chain rezzing from downed state. This also shines in some raid fights like Cairn where players will often get downed and knocked to the edge. Search and Rescue is nice and all, but Garish Pillar is on a 14 second cooldown. You can also rez from long distance not only using your Well of Blood, but also Signet of Undeath (use one or the other) which is good for when you have a kiter that happens to go down. The best run isn't the speedy one, but the one with the least number of wipes. Going for a 5 minute run is moot when you have to attempt it 15 times when you can just squeeze by enrage and still get a clear in under 10-15 minutes from 2-3 attempts if not the first.
---
For gearing Scourge as a healer, you definitely wanna bring Runes of Mercy as not only will this improve your revive speed, but anyone you rez will have half their HP as opposed to 20%. This will prevent a lot of flip-flopping in and out of downed state which can actually kill someone. Stats, you can kinda do whatever you please with this one. It's not as reliant on Healing Power in my opinion and running something like Harrier's or Magi's on this kinda undermines the amazing versatility of this build. Healing Scouge can be a healer that does a good amount of damage. Almost kinda like how Shadow Priests in WoW were at one point. Start out with Shaman's for exotics then move to Plaguedoctor's for ascended. Vitality affects your life force which is essentially your mana for this class. And unless you're anticipating incoming damage, just keep all your shroud skills on cooldown. But try to limit yourself to one per second due to the internal cooldown of Dhuumfire. All your barrier skills apply might to allies. You can also convert incoming conditions into boons. Try running this in Honor of the Waves dungeon. It's silly how much alacrity you get from all the incoming chilled. You can play it by ear with utilities and elites, though those are my personal preference and what I find to be the all-rounder setup. Well of Blood is a must though. Keep in mind you actually have two of these. If you pop Shroud 4 to group everyone up, you can either use your Well of Blood off your healing skill, the Well of Blood that you get via trait when you begin to revive, or do both if you wanna just idk be a god of death or something. You don't have to eat apples or anything. Unless.... oh, Tybalt likes apples. Gods of Death love apples. ILLUMINATI MEMES @.@
---
Just more semi-competent people around. If you ever seen raid squad at HoT metas... well they just melts.
---
&gt; grinding achievements
---
how is grinding a new set of gear more attractive to you?
---
Well gw2 is the most casual friendly mmo around. With horizontal progression those who can join us for only 1h/day (or even less) wouldn't even be able to play through the story in a moderate time if they first need to increase their iLvl to get access to the story instances (like in ffXIV).
---
I for myself am crafting 1 legendary after another for a bit over a year now and I'll need some time to finish of anyway, even without the need to get better gear every few month, since I get everything together by playing whatever I like without thinking about how profitable (in g/h) it is.
---
And for the raids being one timers: if you plan on crafting a legendary armor, you'll need AT LEAST 150 LI = boss kills or even double that for the 2., 3., ... 
---
Only a handful of small graphical bugs.
---
Worth the performance improvement in my book.
---
Where can a Tempest buff both Alacrity and Quickness?
---
why not they did in HoT
---
Really hard to call you an elitist, little troll maybe, quite harmless. 
---
Play your hour do a raid once, if you can not find anything else to do after that, well, do something else; and come back later, you won't have collect yourself a new set of gear with +n stats to kill the next big boss, that's for sure.
---
Horizontal progression is good thing, it gives you more freedom including more free time, and time is a valuable ting. How it promotes content longevity, dunno, it something you said, should it? It keeps previous content relevant, therefore increasing overall longevity? idk, depends how you look at it, and what your goals are. So tell us, what are your goals?
---
Seems like a very Koss thing to do. 
---
Hey, I just wanted to say congrats on not getting fired by anet in febuary.
---
Yeah in a premade Group its no problem but since my mates have different timezones its kinda hard to match.
---
Pugging with a proper buffing support healer is better especially Guards who can shield their entire team from damage while healing.
---
Thats interesting.
---
That's a big grumble cake
---
a hippo, river horse basically, a slow tanky mount on ground, a fast underwater beast underwater.
---
Not the issue, but thanks.

I enjoy "gear grind". I wish this game had it honestly. It feels really good when you finally get a piece of gear that replaces something you already have or completes a set you were building.
---
This game you just get ascended (don't even really need that honestly) and you're done. 
---
there is really nothing else like it
---
Thank you! She is quite proud of it. Not her first try into themed cakes (usually for our 3 children's birthdays), but definitely this was probably the one that had the most detail as source material.
---
Content longevity? Lol 
---
I’ll explain this in basic.. Pve game is like a movie/film.
---
You watch, you learn the little secrets from the plot, you thwart said evildo’er and move on to reward phase of the game/film. (Maybe replay or watch with a friend later but what’s done is done)
---
You can never unsee the story or un know what you have experienced... 
---
So truthfully ALL pve content loses longevity after 1 or 2 play through. (Movies and games included)
---
Only PvP is alive format.. the rest will never have the “content longevity” your asking for (farming come map currency over and over and over... does not count as content longevity)
---
The problem is persistent for all pve games and/or any movies you’ve seen 10+ times.. (you start to be able to actually predict it in your own mind)
---
Lol content longevity doesn’t exist in pve side of games. (And that’s just a human thing not the devs fault... how many times do you want to kill the same boss and watch the same cutscene while getting the exact same loot?)
---
So it’s a human thing why content doesn’t keep longevity (blame it on the human memory I guess)
---
It's not obsession, it's progression model of choice and one of selling points to many gw2 players. You do not change one of base game premises 7 years after release.
---
I'll let you know the taste later today :)
---
Not the issue, but thanks nonetheless.
---
I think that the only way to make bringing her back not feel cheap would be if it came with a price. For example, is she resurrects in a Palawa Joko way, make it have negative consequences for her and the game's characters.
---
That would be great, but it doesn't seem to matter where they get posted, since they almost never get fixed.
---
Every class except necromacer.

Creates a post on mmorpg asking for an mmo which focuses on fun instead of Skinner boxes... Then comes to a subreddit of a game which focuses on fun instead of Skinner boxes and asks why?!?! 
---
Are you foreel?
---
I mean, [you're just here to complain about GW2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/b9kqnn/so_what_mmos_have_good_pve_content_and_combat/ek5zkdz/), instead of actually wanting discussion. Not every game is for you. I highly doubt you've done raids in blue gear or even high-level fractals as well -- it sounds like you just regurgitated what you read on Reddit.
---
GW2 and ArenaNet have some issues, some general to the community, some more personal to a given player.  But horizontal progression isn't one of them.
---
Does it work with taco? I'm guessing no because of highlight 1...
---
You have to look for the releases, by default GitHub shows you the source code. Here's a direct link to the latest release (0.9.8): https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases/tag/v0.9.8b1
---
/gg should not kill you, it should be more like "I give up" so you just play as normal but when 3 ppl say /gg and when there is a differenz of at least 200 points, then the match get stopped and the winner team will get full points, the looser team half of the points they would normally loos.
---
It's more like throwing the match when it's already lost and to don't wast time.
---
Oh, didn't know that! Thanks!
---
10 for 1-500!
---
Anet should hire you.
---
grab some TPs to friend and get your character to HoT metas between "normal" leveling with all the XP bonuses you can afford. though check your account first for any potentially remaining XP consumables, like birthday scrolls, daily writs, and casino coins.
---
Is it at a certain time?
---
yes it works with taco. taco is no d3d9.dll, its a separate overlay

ok this is hilarious xD have an upvote
---
Crafting nets you about 7 levels per crafting discipline. I would save that for the final stretch as crafting is expensive and because of the way levelling exp scales. 
---
Completing the six city maps nets you about 4 or 5 levels.
---
Map completion is actually a decent way of levelling up. If you have a mount, it's fairly painless. Take part in events to speed it up.
---
WvW and PvP both absolutely rain tomes down upon you, so get yourself into them at least for a little while. 
---
There is multiple good answers, here is how I do it:
---
* Birthday Scrolls to maximum available
---
* Cooking to max level. If possible use crafting booster here.
---
* Home city completion. Now this does not help you towards the fastest way but I like to do it by relaxing, watching TV or listening to a podcast. I even do all 5 cities + LA when I plan to level up.
---
* Now you must keep feeding at all times. This is where you start using your various boosters too.
---
* Maps. Go to a map of your level that you like to run and complete it. Always prioritize events. When complete, go to next one. Important note: always kill yellow mobs! They are mostly very quick to kill and give a good chunk of XP.
---
* Story Missions. I personally prefer to start them when the character is around level 50 and go all the way with story 10-40. You’ll get 2 keys out of this.
---
* Daily Missions. Most daily missions will give you some Writs of Exprience, which you can consume as you go along.
---
* Tomes. I personally keep my tomes and only use them when they’ll get me to level 79. If I have 24 for exemple, I’ll use them to get from 55 to 79. This is because I like to finish off to level 80 by myself :).
---
As you can see, I don’t use sPVP or WvW for leveling up. Some will disagree since you can get Tomes and other stuff this way. It’s really up to you but I would suggest you do something you like when leveling up.
---
Good luck!
---
In terms of game mode and gameplay changes I totally agree with you, but if they changed the maps to be exactly the same but with some branded zones (no minions or different terrain, only visaul changes) it could be cool tbh
---
Buying a level-80 boost is the absolute fastest way.
---
yea this isn't what i said
---
i said you lose more total dps by having a healer comp(druid chrono bs dh weaver) with perfect scholar uptime..than by having a no heal comp(slb chrono bs dh weaver) with terrible scholar uptime
---
it's not a 1k on healer, it's a difference between minstrel and zerker firebrand..which is a lot more than 1k
---
aegis doesn't require any type of gear and you won't dps anything with that gear either
---
I am thief main who has thousands of games done, and my opinion is that deadeye is no longer a thing. People used to make fun of deadeye back in 2018 but at least it was relevant and actually useful. Last 2 balance patches nerfed everything that it had to offer: Long stealth durations with 3s after dodge roll and unblockable shot. These were perfect for repositioning and melting tanks on points.
---
Now that theres no unblockable on DE kit, theres nothing that you can do vs bunkers or tanks like Fb, scrapper and warrior. This is what makes DE obsolete, which is a real shame because it was actually really fun build to play with. Stealrh nerf was a cherry on top of nerfcake but it also affects a lot.
---
Take those totals and subtract form that the materials you have in the bank, buy the remainder. 
---
So map complete. What are the cheap available consumables should I get? 
---
Mine is not bugged either
---
d3d9.dll (Arc), d3d9_chainload.dll (GW2Radial), d912pxy.dll (d912pxy)
---
Oh my..
---
To be clear, you're having framerate overshoots when using freesync?
---
Map complete is not the fastest way to level. Killing creatures with high level bonus is considerably faster. It's quite easy to get a level every 10 minutes doing this, more if you use more buffs. The downside is that it's not as engaging as other content.
---
Bonus experience accrues when a creature isn't killed for a long period of time. Once you kill that creature and it respawns, the bonus experience is set to zero so it pays to kill and move on.
---
Go into a new area, kill a couple of creatures and see if the bonus is high. Underwater creatures, yellow creatures that don't attack often have high bonus.
---
Using food and utility items, banners and guild buffs, birthday or celebration boosters and if you have them XP boosters will all stack (birthday and celebration booster count as the same thing) to give you even more experience.
---
Even if you're doing zone complete, keeping this in mind and killing as you go around, when  you see the bonus experience is high is a way to keep your experience ticking over. 
---
I've leveled with someone in my guild with all the buffs who was getting a level every 5 minutes or so, by keeping moving and not killing stuff that didn't have a really high bonus.
---
This has always been a thing. There have never been a moment of peace during the story, which is both shame and good I guess. Peace could be used to create sidestories and go into specifics of main characters and give us a breather. 
---
WP talked about this and personally I think this will be amazing too. I just wonder how we deal with brandstorm debuff since everything kralka touches turns into branded. 
---
Could you share more details about your system?
---
Only 20 minutes long :(
---
This is what I have been thinking since everyone who is dead, goes to the mists so why wouldnt Aurene be there also? 
---
Sorry for the late answer. 
---
So the problem was that a hardware firewall was blocking the requests to the given url provided by deltaconnected. As soon i was able to reach it, build templates worked. 
---
For free: Go bonus creature hunting (An exploration bonus is earned based on how long a creature has been alive in the world), with all available boosts on: food, utility, anything else you might have stacked in the bank, guild banner, guild barman. Make sure to tag any events in our way (don't stick for too long). This should put you on 10 minutes per level +travel time schedule. But nothing is that smooth all the time (you might find yourself spending 30 min per level), so have Tarir waypoint unlocked for meta, feel free to browse dungeon LFG - teams with 2 or 3 80s' should not mind you in there - do that as you transition from one bonus creature farm spot to another.
---
Find someone who is in another instance of the map and group with them and move to their instance. If you are still online I just did that hero point with no issues and I'm in the map doing map completion. DM me and I'll give you my account name. 
---
It's not braindead button-smashing like thief or necro, but it's quite a lot simpler than mesmer or elementalist. Think the engi specializations are quite fun and varied. Holo can deal decent damage and scrapper has many interesting support/tanking models. The kits give you plenty of room to toy with while keeping the UI structure pretty clear.
---
no, not the map completion. 
---
&gt; cheap available consumables
---
open TP and look at whatever food/utility at your level provides kill xp, sort by price
---
Make jojo

I think you may have missed the point with story chapters being an obstacle. Developing any story chapters at all is an obstacle, from the perspective of resources necessary

An episode called "War Eternal" featuring the Elder Dragon with dominion over the mists (originally this was supposed to be Jormag iirc), the same dragon who absorbed the human god of "War" who also happened to have a realm within the mists that featured an army of ghostly warrior called "eternals" not unlike Glint's army of Eir, Snaff and Gwen.
---
It's possibly episode six will see us return to the Fissure of Woe (or explore it's themes of an eternal war in the mists). Balthazar continues to be a plot thread they've lightly weaved into the Season 4 story with Zafirah, a priestess of Balthazar, being introduced to the story _after_ Balthazar was dead and for what purpose? Why specifically have Zafirah mention in Sun's Refuge when she meets Aurene that she can specifically sense Balthazar in Aurene? Going to the Fissure of Woe gives us a familiar location in the mists to base the episode around, it ties in Balthazar's role in the story and allows them to tie up loose ends around Balthazar and creates an opportunity to explore how someone like Devona became a forged warrior long after she died. It also fits in with the theme of Tyrian heroes like Gwen and Eir joining an army in the mists.
---
There is a lot of unexplored story to Balthazar's involvement in PoF and the time between GW1 and today, if we are going to the Mists, the Fissure of Woe makes more sense than any other location given all the plot threads that link up if we go there.
---
It also gives ArenaNet the opportunity to create a map like Dragon's Stand where we take on Kralkatorrik after doing a series of other events around the map (similar to the original Fissure of Woe). A meta map like Dragon's Stand is probably a superior way to do the Fissure of Woe justice than a raid anyway (in GW2 raids are filling the role of dungeons sadly).
---
When I saw the episode title "War Eternal" my first thought was Balthazar's eternals.

Cons: not a good 1v1 class and not a meta class. 
---
Ill also say i like engi. Its more meta in pve, but i find daredevil stronger when soloing. In wvw scrapper is awesome for support, but pve support isnt meta. 
---
So, if I enable replay, the gameplay will be smoother than default 0?
---
Indeed. I don't mind paying a sub if I get a proper return (=content) for it, but ANet's output for all of GW2's existence is far below that threshold. Besides, there's no way they could introduce a sub now - you can remove a sub from a game that has always had one, but you simply cannot add one to a game that has been advertised as b2p for a decade.
---
They're turning the freakin frogs gay!1!!
---
Its really shame that discussion thread gets downvoted, its really interesting topic.
---
If they would introduce it like in ESO, then maybe? People could pay it if they wanted to but could continue as normal without. Ofc there has to be a reason to pay subfee like extra content or skins. Maybe monthly box of random skins that would otherwise be 30-40euros for a subfee of 10.
---
Ofc there would have to be a reason like faster introduce rate for content or bigger releasea or higher variety of things. Its an mmo, shouldny be all about fighting when even the sky is not the limit. 
---
God I hated the ice spikes + wind part in 203. Ended up using the blocking cloud dmg invuln to do the last bit.
---
But how?
---
Finally you would be able to swap character while playing during peak hours!
---
&gt; have them randomly become the commander out of nowhere with no backstory could make no sense
---
Just like any character your boosted up with tomes or lvl 80 booster.
---
It could be a map similar to the Zhaitan fight, specifically the part with the airship, where most of the map is inaccessible and the playable part is a moving platform, here Kralk playing that role.
---
Hippopotamus comes from latin and means "River Horse".
---
So English also calls it river horse. 
---
Silly question, but is there no way to have vsync enabled in windowed fullscreen mode with the addon?
---
The disco zone in Tangled Depths is my favorite. 
---
The meta changed recently, I don't know what you're talking about. If you want to grind new gear every few months you should play WoW or FFXIV. What GW2 requires is more and/or bigger content updates, to statisfy the veteran players.
---
I take it as a personal offense when there's nothing behind any waterfall. 
---
What is this exactly? I’m not used to doing this stuff to my games
---
That was a mind trick.  Mordy using our memories against us made manifest. 
---
That only made my bloodlust for Mordy's head on a stick even greater...
---
You can unlock Hero Points at the Heroics Notary in WvW, but it unlocks a random one in Central Tyria and Maguuma Wastes. 
---
I did that once because the last Hero Point I needed for world completion was bugged too. 
---
If you don't really need it right now I would report the bug then wait and check every day to see if it's fixed. 
---
This
---
You can already support anet with monthly gem purchases.

GW2 is all about CPU. The GPU will probably never limit the games FPS in any meaningful way.
---
I upgraded from a GTX770 to GTX1080 and I don't feel difference (I do have it limited at 60 FPS though). Even played the game without a graphics card for a while and was still able to reach 60 FPS with low settings and around 40 FPS with a mix of medium and high (got an i5-4570).
---
No matter what though, all three setups dropped significantly when lots of characters appeared on screen. And reducing character limit and quality is still by far the biggest FPS difference from what I've seen.
---
Apparently DX9 has some texture limitations that ANet found a way to workaround. This workaround is very CPU heavy though. So lots of characters means lots of texture which melts your CPU while your GPU idles around 10% usage.
---
One dev also commented on performance saying that GW2 heavily relies on one main thread that tries to share its work with other threads but is completely overwhelmed. So adding more threads doesn't really help. They tried to make GW2 better at multithreading but it's a lot of work and probably not a good financial decision at this point.
---
I would assume an older dual CPU with high clock rates would performance better than a modern CPU with 4+ cores but low clock rate.
---
Of course but thats not the topic here. I am talking about the OT here and not to create separate topics about how you should buy gems instead of subfee. Which is also fine. 
---
Backwards Evolution.
---
Too much work, and even if this does work, it wont work on official standards on EVERY mainstream platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).
---
Way too costly I guess and unrealiable for taking years of work. 
---
make this,shoud be ez enough.

---
Pro: it has a very easy, decent damage build for raids/fractals
---
Con: meta build mentioned earlier has basically 0 ranged capabilities.
---
&gt; only play it when a patch is going on.
---
do you think gw2 will offer 2h subs every 4-5 months so we can manage to digest all the "content"?
---
also /s
---
PoF has so many hidden little corners I keep finding more every time I run around there. Like I every time I think wow this must be the last one but then there’s still more 😂 they’re not rewarding in terms of gold but they’re really cute and pretty. 
---
&gt; Stability: without other addons/dx9 based overlays d912pxy works without crashes
---
Stability's been the dealbreaker for me. Great news, gonna finally try it now!
---
Afterburner + RTSS overlay work just fine.
---
[D3D12](https://i.imgur.com/22PnLKn.jpg) means it's running in dx12.
---
... please don't tell me you've got a 1080ti and a dual core CPU.
---
WooooSh
---
looked good tho
---
&gt;This is an unofficial fan-made concept for Guild Wars 2. The creator is not affiliated with ArenaNet or its partners
---
No, quad core. My bad, I was waking up when I made that comment
---
My Gf is playing right next to me and is getting dced all 2 min. And i am completely fine, i dunno what's causing that issue
---
I agree with the parts won't die and easy as hell to play but insane dmg? That sounds preeetty far-fetched
---
You can literally see Kralkatorrik is excreting his excess aura from his now open right eye socket (even though you can't see that side of the head). It's a dead giveaway.
---
&gt;First, because Aurene is actually dead it means that they don't need to have some convoluted reason she can't be around to help with whatever problem we are facing at any given time. Having a dragon - especially an Elder Dragon - as a BFF really does make just about everything trivial and as she got more and more powerful it was going to become more and more silly.
---
While I agree on this point, it does create another - where is this magic going to go? If dead Aurene can absorb magic, then so could dead Kralk, or Mordy, or Zaithan for that matter. The whole "what is dead ends up in the Mists unaltered" idea has a lot of problems on its own.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Disco_Dancing_Delver
---
Right, I should've said insane damage relative to how tanky they are. 
---
When I play against scrappers, I put my whole burst it and barelly scratch their health pool given all their barriers, and when they finally get me, more than half of my health pool goes away within 2 seconds, I feel like it's insane for that spec.
---
People want other races. I get it. 
---
Why not make it even simpler?
---
Upon completion of core story why not just go to the mist fractals. Pay 100g to jump in taimis new experimental transbobulater and voila! You're a tengu! Or an ogre! Whatever anet have time for. Your character would keep whatever voice you created originally be that human norn asura etc. That way no new voice tracks no worries over story, you have to be 80 to do it. 
---
TOLD YOU ! :O
---
Selbbub baffled by the commander's incredible ability to fuck the world up further every time.
---
They also claimed that Guild Wars 2 would never have mounts.
---
Kralkatorrik seems to be in a corrupted portion of the Mists, but so does the commander, given the floating islands. You just need to enter the PvP lobby to see the likeness. "Not taking place outside of Tyria" seems like a really arbitrary limitation.
---
space bdsm waifu 🤐 🔐 ♾ 
---
I think this is the foreshadowing of the next Mastery - All the Mounts will get wings, but I think the restriction will be that it will work on Ep 6's map only. 
---
As stated many times. I use a macro for it and even that lacks perfect consistency.
---
Fuk u guys im sitting on top.
---
Ah thanks for correcting! I just looked up the Jade Temple.. I guess I was confused because it doesn't exist
---
Well yeah what skill could there possibly be in pressing two buttons at the same time? It's literally just pressing two buttons. The outcome is what is inconsistent, so that is why I said that it would make more sense to have a key bind that guarantees the outcome seeing as there is literally no harm in doing so for the game integrity. Having random output with no way of guaranteeing success for the same action every single time is pointless
---
What's the link to install this and does it update automatically or i have to download something?
---
Thank you for your work :)
---
Jame "The Commander" Gumb
---
I had forgotten about this comment thread so this reply really confused me for a minute there. 
---
Are you talking about me? Brother Drake, or the You tuber? Cause I've never made that drive personally.
---
I did this because I noticed the installer was running but never seemed to did anything. Now my game won't load? LOL Was I supposed to copy all the other d3d9 files in the dll folder over too?
---
Effect: Makes your character skin glisten and gives "I feel renewed %10 increase to xp" buff for 10 minutes
---
My take on stuff:
---
We know that Current Events team have a release being a preparation for ep6. Either it would be just another boring tyria wide invasion like awakened or mordrem OR we will fight Kralk porting all around Tyria. Flying. For everyone to see what a juicy content PoF have.
---
It is possible that this trailer is a part of those events and not ep6.
---
Now, to more obvious things. I hate when WP just don't notice things like that.
---
KRALKY IS BLEEDING. From his destroyed eye and parts of his wings. He is weak and running away, not fighting. He most likely lost some of his powers and that's the best and only moment to take him down. Maybe he can't even freely jump between mists and tyria.
---
Pact and Elona forces unite to take him for good at all cost. It's possible that we will get new, flying mount. How could we make it unique comparing to griffin? It have to be slower and maybe could have a way to increase attitude. Would it be too OP making griffin obsolete? No, if we could hinder it somehow. It may need a long starting zone, and be much less agile, and slower in air. This won't make rabbit useless if we can't just pop it anywhere and fly like that.
---
Now, we need it to be more unique. Allow us to do stand on it, being able to fight while loosing ability to control it. It will circle or follow along our target, while allowing us to fight! We could get actual air battles vs certain new enemies. Just imagine, walking through Queensland when an epic fight against branded stats on the sky, where dozens of mounted players fight against incoming threat. At the same time ground forces have to destroy falling crystals and defend against branded intrusion.
---
Also, maybe Aurene will awaken and become this wyvern like mount? And spawn more of those? 
---
Personally, I love the engi's animations, especially for asura. Things have real weight and character to them. I agree about the rifle autoattack though. Rifle and pistols don't feel good to autoattack with at all. Really slow and clunky. I love skills 2-5 though. I disagree about the bomb kit. How else are you supposed to drop extremely heavy barrels besides bend at the knees?
---
looks like a warclaw grew wings
---
Koss don't need no publisher. He is Koss the Boss and will save Tyria by himself and write an amazing book while doing it.
---
Yes! At Last! Radial Support!
---
Thank you so much @megai2 for your amazing effort and support. I was following your project since the begining and now i had the chance to install it with GW2 Radial finally. It looks really promising and causing only some minor graphical issues which is tolerable for me.
---
The only thing is I got an arcDPS error when I quitted the game after the installing of the d912pxy:

Thank you.
---
Soooooooo another infusion ?
---
&gt;  perhaps a berserker/assassin set with pact rune
---
What's the sense of a hybrid build if you're going for full dps?
---
You could simply go to a makeover npc at any town and preview everything.
---
Definitely. 
---
The playerbase would literally (not literally) evaporate
---
Engineer
---
-PvE = Holo
---
-PvP = Bunker Scrapper
---
-WvW = Antidote Scrapper
---
Is this English?
---
"come to Quaggans roOoOom Tonight, you wont regret it!" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Engineer, because stuff explodes. This is literally why I made one.
---
Unfortunately, the best explody thing also causes carpal tunnel syndrome. 
---
&gt; How else are you supposed to drop extremely heavy barrels besides bend at the knees?
---
1. Redo the kit model and animation. Scrap the "carrying keg" thing. Replace it with a bomb we carry in our hand. 
---
2. Recycle Throw Mine throwing animation for the autoattack. 
---
3. For Smoke Bomb, recycle the Mine Field animation, where the character raises their arm and bombs scatter around them. (In this case, they can be reworked into gas canisters forming a circle around the engineer)
---
3. Make good use of the Throw Mine animation by recycling Glue Bomb into a ranged skill. (This would benefit the kit immensely, IMO)
---
Alternatively, instead of the Throw Mine animation for most of the skills, they could have the Engineer with some sort of arm attachment (similar too Medkit), and a switch in hand they could press like Yoshikage Kira to dispense bombs.
---
There is soooo much they could do, instead of the slapstick that is the giant kegs.
---
would render the griffon useless tho 
---
Hoodies and T-shirts? No. Catmander pin? It's pretty good, and they even threw in some weird DoTA 2 emoticharm pins I didn't ask for.
---
&gt; trying to explain serial communication to me like it has any relevance to what I am claiming
---
Since you apparently don't understand the serial nature of keyboard commands, there's no way you'll ever understand how/why you're failing. That's unfortunate.
---
I just got my ascended bubble helmet for underwater a few days ago!! Bring on bubbles 
---
What do you mean? Are they never gonna be awakened in gw2?
---
Have you visited Lair of Zommoros in Domain of Vabbi?
---
Can anyone tell me who's doing the organized Triple Trouble runs on NA? We have the TTT team on EU, but I'm a bit lost on NA -- looking to get some mastery points for my alt and I'm not sure when I should be waiting. Usually not available post-reset so I'm really wondering about other times.
---
I tried soloing Sorrow's Embrace this morning and got my ass handed to me. When I see videos like this, my jaw drops in awe. I suck at this game.
---
Honestly WvW is so much better now with this feature.
---
&gt; Since a Diviner's set is costly to make, I wonder if I can substitute it with something else, perhaps a berserker/assassin set with pact rune?
---
That would probably work, Pact Runes are a pretty decent choice, but you'd still need Diviner's Accessories and Weapons. And if you have the gear why not stat-swap it to Diviner stuff?
---
I want to laugh and say this a joke then I look at early warclaw design on the wiki 
---
I am saying they were put to sleep again, we may end up with the story wrapping up without them awakening again.
---
I just got my tailor from 0-460 using the site a few days ago so mostly it’s still good!
---
If you just leveled it, it may be level-up rewards; they usually can't be sold or salvaged.
---
Laptop is less then 2 weeks old but will check tomorrow. 
---
Pay it. GW2 is the only game where I feel like I don't miss anything because the levelcap is and stays the same and I don't have to keep up with the gear treadmill. And the artistic vision of the game is so beautiful that I don't feel bad paying 15 bucks a month. 
---
However: Then the cashshop needs to go, at least for about 85%. Mount and glider skins need to be in the game, earnable through content, etc. 
---
That will never happen, and I am 100% convinced that the cash shop made them more money so far than a sub fee would have. 
---
Moreover, because of their "our game will never require sub" marketing, many players will take them up on this, call them liars and leave the game if they ever do it.  
---
So they can't ever do that. 
---
And I am glad GW2 is explorable for those who cannot afford to spend money on a hobby every month. Some people have it hard. Tuitions, medical treatments... 
---
They should still be able to experience Tyria and its Living World content.  
---
It is not a deal breaker of course but i'm trying to understand what is the problem with the regular one and why you released another version of it?
---
&gt; Im pretty sure she absorbed that energy on Zhaitans death, not from Mordremoth.
---
Probably not, the egg would have either been high in the air with the Zephyrites, thus far away from any ley line, or it would have been being protected by Vlast. In either case, it remained dormant until between Season 1 finale and Season 2 prologue (aka Festival of the Four Winds '14).
---
&gt; Very possible. Her facial structure changed pretty drastically when she absorbed Balthazars magic and grew up. Her face as a baby resembled Mordremoth much more than it did when she was a teenager. As a teen it became sleeker and the same curved cheeks that she had as a baby and that Mordy has became much less curved and prominant. They elongated and became more sleek.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Not to mention that her coloration was altered as well. As a baby her blue was more aquamarine while as a teen it became more royal blue.
---
&gt; So her shape and color be altered by magic isnt all that farfecthed. Look at Vlast. He was yellow despite both Glint and Aurene being blue tinted.
---
But she's not growing up here. She's the same size as ever before, if that is her that is, though I do believe this dragon shown is a bit bulkier than Aurene's slender form. And going from one blue to a deeper blue while growing up isn't nearly as stark of a difference between going from deeper blue to gray when *not* growing up.
---
As for Vlast's color: Kralkatorrik is purple, though depicted as green in Edge of Destiny, and Vlast's render is green despite showing up in-game as yellow/gold.
---
ppl getting rly bored in this game :D
---
Jump jump jump = Sir, are you portaling this JP?
---
Jump jump jump = Stack here for portal!
---
I wonder what's the meaning of the title of the episode.
---
I guess we end up defeating Kralkatorrik (how, though? trap him somewhere? we open a tear in the mists with the assistance of Arkk, Dessa and Taimi and throw him outside the mists? we'll see) but we end up awakening another dragon in doing so (or even the sea dragon). Thus we're still in war...an eternal war, even if it's a bit of an hyperbole,
---
So this post seems to be asking some rather different questions. I'll try to address them separately.
---
&gt;whats the difference between Runecrafter's and Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic?
---
Since the rune and sigil rework, item upgrades are no longer extracted from items when salvaged, except with the Black Lion Salvage Kit. Rather, most salvage kits only have a chance to salvage the embedded rune or sigil, with higher chances from higher tier salvage kits. Hence, the Runecrafter's is used primarily to ensure that runes and sigils embedded in items are also salvaged, therefore increasing the probability of obtaining Charms and Symbols.
---
&gt;I can't grasp why Copper-Fed is 800 gems vs Runecrafters at 600 gems, when runecrafters seems to have better salvaging stats. 
---
I'm uncertain myself, and some deeper research would probably be needed to explain the decision. For additional context, the Silver-Fed Salvage-o-Matic costs 500 Gems.
---
&gt; Is there a concept I'm missing here? I currently have my copper-fed one for like 2 years and use it on all my blue/greens, while using mystics on my yellows. 
---
[Here is the latest research](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b5xd7d/loot_tables_for_different_breakdown_methods_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) on the different salvage results, and proposed best use of Salvage Kits, courtesy of u/rude_asura. 
---
TBH, I'm not sure it was ArenaNet who ever said that. A lot of people constantly claimed that, but I for one can never recall such a statement ever being made, especially officially. And I've paid attention to GW2 news pretty strongly since its announcement, being an avid GW1 player.
---
Anyone remember when he was the anti-christ? Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
The only time they've done big ban waves was when they specifically looked for the md5 of certain files. So the chance is fairly low considering ANet would likely contact the developer first and warn them if they consider it against the rules before they actually ban people.
---
I've been soloing since start of 2k14 tho :( best content
---
Ranger: good survival and good options for ranged builds.
---
Both mine and my girlfriend's shirts are getting little holes in them now sadly. Maybe one and a half years old now.
---
More like thief
---
Any version without music?
---
It's the reason I am playing and still paying for gems.... Sooooooooo
---
In open world I play [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNArYRnc0AV3gd3AmbC83gliBbaFMDiBx9whYSMKAMASAA-jZw+AAQZAA) with scepter/dagger as main but with GS on swap. Has ok condi burst with GS 5 + 4 because of deathly chill triggering and blind causing chill too. 
---
Full viper gear with thorn runes but something else condi ish could work too I suppose. It's no meta build, but I just really like Caladbolg. =P
---
I theory crafted a condi reaper putting some focus on blinds, and I have to say that the 3 second cooldown on Chilling Darkness really hanpers it. Half the pulses on GS4 won’t chill.
---
But the important question: Is NUUVEM one of the official retailers?
---
I'm at work and the mobile retailer site is booty on my phone so I can't check myself. But I don't want people to buy things like this and risk their account without knowing they are doing so. 
---
Right at the end, riiiiight when we’re about to kill Krak, STEVE/BUBBLES leaps out of the water and Deep Blue Sea’s him—absorbing all of his accumulated magic and once again power creeping our elder dragon problem.
---
Engi main here.
---
Holosmith and scapper both have it's uses in end-content, base condi-engi not so much (anymore), but is *really* fun to play. So, it really depends what you are after.
---
Yes, they are. I bought both expansions from there.
---
Hasn't been crashing for me
---

They're the registered Brazilian retailer

I have been raised in an islamic culture and we don't read from right to left. It's because of an alphabet. That's how you read in Arabic.

better remove gw2hook first
---
New dev shirt design?
---
The outcome is perfectly, 100% consistent. There is 0 rng involved. None. Otherwise macros wouldn't work, and they do.
---
If you're having trouble with It, it's on you doing it wrong. You should practice and play close attention to your timing, almost as if you were building a skill.
---
Think bigger, solo it on heal guard. 
---
You know ele is underpowered when you see Roul soloing on something else.
---
Level up rewards (Items from the gold flying diamond above your minimap) are not salvageable.
---
Yeah, that's also true, they've been pushing closer to 3 months than they have 2 months for most of LS4
---
True, unless it were restricted to this map. Then again it's probably unlikely
---
I like it 
---
Thanks! Phone was giving me troubles trying to look it up myself. 
---
Actually they could release it as a separate test launcher like they did with the 32bit 64bit and people who didnt want crashes could just not use it lol. 
---
This is what keeps me from installing it.
---
I get that it isn't cheating and that there's no reason why they would ban people for using it. I also remember posts about waves of bans caused by something ridiculously benign.
---
I'm glad this exists, but I don't want to take any chances. If I install this and they mistakenly ban me, my only defense would be, "But I didn't do anything wrong!" And we all know how likely they are to believe that.
---
I hope they see this utility and realize how much they could improve the game by doing something similar. Then they can add the improvements to the game. But until then, I'm satisfied with turning down my settings a bit if my frame rate suffers. It's better than worrying about an unjust ban.
---
Of course, they could mistakenly ban me regardless, but the best I can do is to avoid anything that would distinguish me from the general GW2 population. As it is now, anything that would get me banned would also ban the rest of the player base. 
---
*Spoiler!*
---
He's extra mad, too. He was still washing off Zhaitan!
---
Yup I will pass, the last versions of this crapped out my game. The previous 2 worked great. Not sure what happened, but I started getting this just like you, then in WvW I noted extremem loads when I waypointed, up to 5 or more mins every time. Then the TP stopped working right. It would open and pull up stuff, but when I clicked to buy it might take 20 mins and it got progressivly worse. I had to in the end uninstall guild wars 2 and start a new install. 
---
I am not sure what happened in the last version vs the two before it but man. 
---
Pros: Very flavorful and offers a unique experience for a new player, as no other class is rewarded as much for their open world exploration as a Ranger. It also has a large variety of  builds and roles it can take in PvE, and all of its traitlines are useful in their own right and offer really interesting traits that can change playstyle significantly (Quickdraw in Skirmishing, Fortifying Bond in Nature Magic, Companion's Defense and Rugged Growth in WS etc.). Its also pretty OP in PvP and solo WvW.
---
Cons: Might be too simple for some people. Signet skills are mostly bad apart from Stone, some of the shouts are too specialized for general use, Spirits are mostly useless unless you are support in PvE and traps only work for condi builds. So while there is a variety of builds for rangers, the variety of skills each build can use is not too high. The class also relies on pet AI unless you are in Beastmode. Finally, it is historically unwanted in WvW zergs.
---
i suggest you have network problems or server lags, cuz load times mostly affected by game logic, not by graphics.
---
The thing about Ranger is your not very ranged when it comes to meta builds which sucks. So don’t be expecting to longbow in groups sadly.
---
Soulbeast greatsword is a fun weapon at least.
---
Siphon damage melts steel doors.
---
Yeah, can only drop them in mystic toilet and get 1 salvageable for 4 unsalvagable items.
---
Interesting.
---
cant wait for the release out of beta :)
---
[No-kit Holosmith](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Power_DPS_No_Kit) because Engineers are cool but carpal tunnel syndrome isn't.   
---
Also [Power DPS Soulbeast](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_DPS) because Ranger greatsword has always looked and felt great.
---
Both are potent, easyish to learn, and improve with practice.  
---
Cons:   DPS elite will expect you to mash more buttons on an Engi with kits, or cancel skills on the SB.
---
I do these all the time in game, but when I do it IRL I'm suddenly a weirdo, psh.
---
Accessories &gt; weapons &gt; armor in that order will give you the largest gain.   Theres several achievements that can give you condi pieces in ascended or exotic form.  Not necessarily faster but a nice alternative. 
---
Look at it this way:
---
When there's a gear treadmill, it's insanely difficult to catch up with everyone else when you're a new player or a returning player or even a current player just gearing a new toon, because often the gear builds upon itself. (For example: you can't just jump straight from basic gear set to, say Gear Set 14 in the progression. You have to go from basic to set 2 in order to be able to do the content for set 5, which you need to do the content for set 8, etc.) When a game is new, it isn't so bad. When a game is very old, this problem only gets worse and worse.
---
Without gear treadmill, it's much easier to catch up with the current meta, because you don't have to work your way up to being geared -- you either already have the gear, have access to it, or at least (in the case of total noobs) only have a moderate amount of work required to be properly geared for your class.
---
Do you still have to learn the rotation? Sure. But that's something that anyone can practice a little and learn -- it's nowhere close to having to climb multiple mountains just to get the gear you need and STILL have to learn the rotation anyway.
---
You've vastly overstated the "problem" with things you have to learn. Changing traits takes all of ten seconds. The vast majority of classes go months or even years without having to do more than very minor changes to their rotation, and it's generally just a small adjustment and not anything entirely new. Even chronos, who probably have the most frequent changes to their builds/gear/rotation are usually only replacing pieces of their set rather than the entire thing -- whereas a gear treadmill would mean constantly working to replace your entire set every time a new one comes out.
---
Besides -- if there was a gear treadmill, do you think that having to change traits and learn new rotations would just magically go away? No, gear treadmill doesn't *replace* that requirement. It just adds another, even bigger, obstacle to being raid (or whatever content) ready. 
---
And it's funny that you call horizontal progression "boring" while complaining about having it actually change traits and adjust rotations (i.e. do something requiring mental effort). How is just getting new gear somehow more "fun" than actually having something that makes you think a little bit? It doesn't take much effort to learn minor changes to a new rotation, really, but it takes even *less* effort to just do the same thing forever only with newer gear every few months. There is absolutely nothing exciting about the gear treadmill, and all the passive-aggressive post edits in the world aren't going to change my mind... just as mine probably hasn't changed yours, because you have also clearly made up your mind.

The dragon in the distance of the final shot is 100% the Shatterer. It's even using the Shatterer's bugged "launching off the ground while in the sky" animation you can sometimes see in Blazeridge Steppes.

Copper fed has almost zero use cost, so it's better for mass salvaging
---
PvD at its greatest.
---
Just what I said, don't put players in that situation. Longer queue time to actually match you in your bracket, if you lose a match that takes 10 matches to recover from, you are significantly better off never entering the match to begin with. I guess this comes with it's own set of problems though, mostly with match collusion and queue time at high brackets. But the collusion thing can easily be bannable and if you are really itching for pvp you can hop into WVW while you wait for your match to pop.
---
Yeah, the Commander lances Kralk with the anti-Kralk lances, and so interrupts Bubbles' underwater leisure time by dumping a frigging branded corpse of an elder dragon into his ocean. Should've added some details to make that all clearer, but I had the intention to scribble that as fast as possible, so... whatevs! :3
---
Thank you!
---
Imaging everyone irl communicating like this made me laugh!
---
Cheers!
---
Thanks! Will look further into it.
---
Looking at you, evil resonating slivers clogging 2 guild banks.
---
While I don’t disagree, I went with only what was listed by OP. Also, didn’t assume they would have a healren to put with the quickbrand... so, if that’s the only option, it makes a decent healer.
---
Having the ren be the healer is WAY more optimized, but if you don’t have a ren, a firebrand healer imo has more use, than a ren healer with no firebrand.
---
Give Yak's Bend their Warclaw back
---
That should be a one time thing as d912pxy builds a new cache.
---
The next airship needs to be created from that kind of metal.
---
You might suggest that but you would be wrong. It's completely fine before I an stalled and After I reinstalled the game. But from the moment I installed the last version to the moment I reinstalled the game, it was terrible. It had everything to do with loading the graphics, and UI. It was loading the blue world with no models or textures that ever so slowly popped in over time. This does not happen without the mod. 
---
Jumping sideways back and forth: Get a move on you slowpokes!
---
Again, the long loads were before the reinstall and only after and during the time the mod was installed. And while running the mod my ping stayed between 22 and 47 MS as normal. I have run this game over 7 different system configurations since beta. I know how it runs on my machines. I know when I have a poor connection etc.  It also showed a steady FPS rate of 80 or even 120 In WVW in some places, even when it was hanging and stuttering for those 10-second skips like the other person was talking about. 
---
Now, The AV thing you could be on to something. The AV would have had to have been partially blocking the mod as Guild Wars and its processes are whitelisted. I did check that but I as I have little experience with the mod I could have easily overlooked it. Other than UI what would the mod be affecting in the TP when Trying to purchase an Item? I could go down all the way to the "buy instantly" or w/e its says, then it would just hang for 20 or so mins, sometimes bring up the item, and some times just say it was unable to process try again later. 
---
Is this mod triggering AV for others? 
---
no gear treadmill means no need for grinding for the best slots in order to participate in "high end "content.
---
It also means you dont need to "start over" when new content goes live and raises the bar be it in stats or lvl cap or some special bunch of passives or any other sort of vertical progression system.
---
"horizontal progression is boring", its subjective, a lot of people here think vertical progression is even more boring since in most cases youre spamming the same content over and over till you get that rng drop that you need..and then after some time you start over.
---
You can "get better" gear by going trough ascended gear, legendary gear, and higher infusion slots, or a better skin that you like. It can be just as exciting as finding a new piece of gear that will make you slightly stronger.
---
Balance patches are trying to balance things out in most cases across all professions and specializations rather than change things drastically and change the "core feature/role" of a class.
---
The meta is still the same as group content relies on the group supporting each other in the best possible way , mostly in terms of dps.
---
In most mmos you could say the same, its always 1 tank, 1 healer and 2-3 dps. Yes there are offtanks and offhealers, and some dps is better used in different situations but the same could be said with this game and its various raid bosses and fractals/pvp/wvw.
---
If youre always trying to be the absolute meta then you shouldnt be surprised to spend some gold and learn a slightly new rotation which changes every time new stats come to the game or balance patches that impact the current meta.
---
You wish for change but dont wanna change any of your gear, class and rotation is what im getting here.
---
Also, does changing a few trait lines and weapons take that much time?
---
There will never be perfect balance between all classes, that doesnt rly exist in any mmo, but they do make a great job in some aspects of the game. There will always be meta, but you can really play raids for example on any class provided everyone pulls their own weight,knows the encounter,and supports the team properly. 
---
This has been demonstrated over and over and over again trough out the years, but most people still blindly follow the meta and golem benchmarks
---
I suppose it could be. I just wouldn't suspect a straight off copy of such a renown boss without a few more notable changes.
---
After the Cat-apult now we have the Arrow Cat.
---
Poor people in Guild Wars (no jumping)
---
lore was never the issue
---
quit
---
And now take a Herald with Shiro F2 and a Renegade with Kalla elite.
---
But they have the side step dance instead of jumping.
---
They don't support linux at all and Mac launched a "test client" in 2017 (out of beta?) so it is not like Mac is on par with windows client in any shape or form to begin with.
---
&gt;Customer support basically told me to go f*ck myself and that they weren't going to help me. 
---
Might want to remove this line else it might come off as rude
---
Yeah, I figured I just shouldnt have said anything. Not much of this has been helpful. If you had read you would have seen I already did that. You would have also seen I only had the issue in the last release of the mod. You would have seen the problem only happend the ont time since beta that I installed this mod. You would have also noticed it was also paired with other issues that other people had with the mod. Also would have read I had to uninstall then reinstall the game after the last version of this mod was installed. People keep telling me oh it can't be the mod it only does this or affects that. Fine. That's ok. I am going to pass on this version and try again at some point in the future. I see roger people saying they were having some of the same issues. Np. It's a beta. There are apparently more bugs to work out. No foul no harm. It's funny though. People treated the author like he was the devil about 2 months back. Now there is no possibility there cold be anything wrong with a beta version of the mod. 
---
i dont even know what the problem of the support is with your problem. they can just create and mail items to you anyway and tell you to destroy certain items beforehand.  
---
once before the system to change stuff via mystic forge i wrote support because i picked wrong stats on some asc items. got told to destroy the item and got mailed a new one without stats so i can select them new.  
---
and in your case you either have: a clearly legendary item bound to your account with another skin or some other rarity with a legendary skin and also probably progress on some legendary archivement hunter or however its called.  
---
so there is enough proof so they could just tell you to destroy the item and get a new one mailed.  
---
ask that the ticet gets escalated to /u/Dornsinger tbh.
---
augury rock pug
---
Maybe (using the official ticket system) let them know that Dornsinger was going to look at it, and that they should escalate it to him specifically (and provide the source).
---
Might want to remove this line else it might come off as rude. And probably the second paragraph. The last part of the post suggests you still want help, but this rant is stepping a little too far for someone that still wants help.
---
The only official responce from ANet is removal of topics on gw2 forum that have direct link to project.
---
How do you get that crosshair? 
---
Hahahanthat seems to be Koss' perspective based on how he describes his po publisher in the book
---
You cant jump in GW2?
---
A D A D A D A D D *dodge down the cliff*
---
I let you bang, bro!
---
We should have seen that coming, the hylek were already a rainbow
---
If I recall the original thread correctly Dornsinger has already responded to this and communicated the reasons why they can't help in this situation. Even something like skins from the pre-wardrobe days aren't a confirmation of ownership since we had PvP weapon skins that can muddy the water in that regard.
---
At a certain point people just have to take no for an answer. If they could help they would. Support aren't going to spend a month or more being like, "Yeah, nah, we can't help" just to be obtuse.
---
I need logs for that.
---
I'm pretty sure sPvP is competitive as intended. People are not rude because of the way it's designed. They're rude because they can't stand loosing and they often don't accept to look at their own mistakes. And I said often, not always.
---
Cries in falldamage from the top of verdant brink :P

It was posted earlier to that sub, so i could understand why :)

woaw thats crazy , does it improves performance the more ram you let it take?

Underwater content confirmed? Time to buy the underwater precursors again! /s
---
Perhaps what you'd be interested in better/more rewarding Activities? Some activities used to have a coin reward for playing them (more if you win), just like regular PvP matches. Perhaps they would be less dead if they gave PvP Reward Track progress?
---
I don't think it's possible to make gw2 pvp more casual than it already is. Competitive players left long ago, anet killed their esport dream and ranked is currently a seasonal gold farm with badges now.
---
How can it be related to WoW ? In the r/Guildwars2 ? 
---
Indeed and agreed, good sir!
---
Or like any character that didn't play the Personal story
---
It's truly hit and miss actually. When it comes to items (pay or not) they're pretty damn good at dealing with it but issues of harassment they are like babbling idiots with no clear proper protocol to follow it seems. I had a terrible experience when I was being stalked for at least 5 months with support being basically useless and I had to quit the game to get away from it. So yeah, hit or miss.
---
I will do the same. 
---
Any place is a hidden dance area if you try 
---
Another support case for anet being trash. 
---
Dornsinger looked at the ticket, and even [replied at the previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aygcs7/please_help_me/ei2mel0/?st=ju61yj90&amp;sh=651feb36). 
---
TL;DR:
---
* Apparently there were other ways to get such a skin (PvP, transmuting the skin into a white item and trading it, that probably made it account bound though, right ?).
---
* They can't dig up logs to confirm OP crafted them.
---
* They have a strict policy against trading high value items, especially since people have scammed support by requesting more Moto infusions (mentioned in that thread by Dornsinger).
---
I'm sorry for your loss OP, it seems pretty likely that you did have the legendaries at some point, but if support has given you their final word on the issue, then it doesn't look like any more reddit posts are going to change that, especially when you are kinda being passive aggressive and ironic. Accept the loss and move on, maybe recrafting them can be a new goal for you and at least you get to have the skins.
---
Wow. I think this is the nerdiest thing I've ever seen/read.
---
It's *perfect*.
---
I've written only 4 and they helped me every single time
---
if i recall correctly this should not be a problem, since legendary skins couldn't be obtained in pvp back then...or am i completly wrong here?  
---
wiki is incomplete about this topic.
---
While I also share the sentimentality that healers were bad for this game causing players to learn bad habits, I don't agree with the way you present your ideas. They come of on a dickish way and aren't going to persuade anyone that way.

&gt;now the group are flying their sentient glass airship within a Brandstorm above the Mouth of Torment, towards an undead mech made from Zhaitan's remains, which is piloted by Palawa Joko. Meanwhile, Balthazar is flying on a Forged Vlast, fighting Kralkatorrik in the background.
---
This exerpt needs to be framed... 
---
I losely follow a playgroup who is streaming their sessions and stuff can get a little crazy there... but how do you get to this level of utter chaos??
---
Also where do you go from there? What happens when they 'win' or 'lose'/'die'?
---
How do you get a story like this back down to earth (figuratively and literally) without starting over?
---
I know everyone’s posting it, but it’s very true to start from level 1. Go through the story. Play around with new things and explore Tyria one piece at a time. Every time you level up, you get new information and things to learn like combo fields and buffs. Learn how to dodge in the dodge roll training in the first zone. Dm me if you’re interested to learn, but I’d really only go with you if you start off new and see the game for what it is rather than skipping straight to endgame
---
Right there is why I rebound the dodge key.
---
This exerpt got wilder and wilder with every word.
---
First, this is something the Anet team has decided to do after reviewing their team structures and internal processes. People can agree with it and accept it or disagree with it and accept it, but either way, the only way forward is to accept it.
---
Second, why do we really need a new map with every release? The effort that would ordinarily go into churning out new maps could go into something else, like fixing up an older one and applying mechanics that offer it replayability, or additional story instances, or a fractal - pretty much anything.
---
Wait to see what they do with the additional resources and then decide if it's better or worse. As much as I love new maps and ~~breaking~~ exploring them, I'd rather have one meaningful map than four that don't really pay back the effort that went into creating them.
---
This is one of those times where one upvote just isn't enough.
---
...unless it *is* the current storyline!
---
in story,where death is just minor inconvience..... anyone rly care?
---
Definitely don't remember there being any legendary skins in pvp originally, or even anything in the locker for them- higher ranks unlocked moreso cultural/dungeon gear from memory.
---
You can jump in the original Guild Wars.  You're just very limited in how you do it, no jumping in directions or circles, since it's just an emote.
---
Thank you very much :)
---
I will check out Sandswept and Kourma, but yeah, seems like Lake Doric will be my destination. And yeah, i agree with Vipers, but for the moment Exotic will be enough. Just to see if the build will work as i want it to.
---
Thief with stick. Cause I have a stick and I am bounces. 
---
What are you on about? The research was done after the March 26 update to unidentified gear, as noted by the date of the post.
---
I do have something like 160ish gold right now. So yeah, not that much.
---
Other than doing the Dailies and running around collecting mats there doesn't seem to be to much reliable income sources without going raiding.
---
I wll check out the Ogre Camp in TD for Linseed. If i get a 'a lot'... i might go for Viper exotics.. but right now i have no issue with the Charged Quartz... i have a quartz crafting node in my home instance and a kryt crystal right next to it, to charge them. So charged Quartz isn't much of an issue.
---
Did the enter on your 10-key not work too?
---
Not true. According the research linked, you stand to gain more profit using Runecrafter's under some conditions.
---
This is Exalted as hell
---
I will have to check the market for these glyphs. I don't mind a bit more costly equipment. I know that seems to be a bit of a contradiction but as i have no reason to really stop playing in the near future... such a glyph might be worth an investment in the long run.
---
Take a look at [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character)  as well, the real important thing is getting your stats close to what you need.

Why, what happens?  If you don't mind me asking?

Go to /r/guildrecruitment to find a guild looking for more players, plenty of guilds from all gamemodes and levels of play ask for people on that subreddit.

I ordered a plush Quaggan as a Christmas gift. I received a CS:GO mug instead. Left many messages on their perpetually busy customer service line, but they never called me back.

If you send them money, good luck.
---
Yes, it depends on what your salvaging.
---
Just in case you didn't know, there is also r/GuildRecruitment and r/GamerPals for finding friends to play with.
---
Discords like the one linked in the sidebar here, or those of popular GW2 content creators are also great places to make friends.
---
A few weeks ago someone posted their idea about a Dominion of the Winds home city and a single neighboring noob map for a hypothetical Tengu playable race.   I like that idea better because it could effectively fold this race into the core maps/story, allowing Tengu characters to become the Pact Commander.  When we go to Cantha, I would prefer *ALL* the maps to be level 80.  
---
I know of the one in Tangled Depths, near the Ogre Waypoints. There's another one?
---
If it's internally consistent, that's awesome and death isnt problematic. The problem is more that our character and characters around us act as though death is a major thing. Eir dying was major enough to power like two separate plot lines, Aurenes death is supposed to be terrifying for the world, Glints death and Vlasts death, our player characters death, etc etc. Death is dangled over us in the plot of GW2 as a terrifying end but then routinely ignored, which is confusing because you are absolutely right that it wasn't really that way in GW1.
