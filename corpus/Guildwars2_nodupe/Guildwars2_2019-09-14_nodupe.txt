Yeah. I want to play s1, but it would likely have to come at the cost of current story, and it gets into a value proposition: Retread s1 or move forward.

I get my social aspect from my guild. I don't really need a social aspect from the world. I play virtually everything I do in this game with other people socially, which isn't to say random people. People who want a social aspect can look for it and find it here. It probably takes more work. 
---

---
I might have liked WoW more if I had made my own guild in it, but way back then I didn't know enough about MMOs or WoW to do that. I did it in Guild Wars 1 and in every game I've played since have looked for a like minded guild. 
---
Socializing doesn't have to be, and in my mind shouldnt' be limited to the open world.
---
Technically, everyone is a magic user to some extent. Warriors don't just carry a half dozen banners in their pocket, they conjure them the same way an elementalist conjures up a lava axe. Thieves/assassins use magic to vanish in shadows. 
---
Paragons use both, imbuing their inspiring shouts and spears with magic. They don't just get you so excited that you spontaneously cover your sword in fire, they do it magically.
---
People are always unhappy that they started putting the best cosmetic rewards in the cash shop for a game that basically will only have cosmetic progression.
---
They're definitely key to the game for certain demographics. But then you get lines that good players do ten times the damage that average players do and you think, maybe people aren't really learning the classes they have now. Maybe a lot of people just jump in a reaper and try to make it through the stuff they do as easily as possible. They're not looking for another core spec, because those people are overwhelmed by what they have. They need easy, and more rather than new.
---
For harder core players, and PvPer and WvWers elite specs change up the meta. But I have a guild of players who haven't even moved off the HOT elite specs to the PoF ones yet, because there's just too much to learn, and they're just casuals. I think the number of casuals out there is probably astonishing, considering the word average indicates there are people much worse as well.
---
I'd personally like to see new elite specs, but I suspect they'd be wasted on a reasonable percentage of the community.
---
“...still standing.”
---
The lootboxes actually have a lot of utility. Tyrian exchange vouchers, statuettes that can be exchanged for boosters and primers, I always convert gold to gems when the price is high and then stock keys for when there’s a key sale, then use the keys when there’s a good chest.
---
&gt;We’re going to continue to be iterative in our design processes, and how we can release things faster and more efficiently
---
This is where I think a breakdown in communication occurs. We *had* a reasonably efficient - and more importantly, consistent - system that alternated Living World seasons with expansion packs. Mike says they're committed to iterating design and releasing faster, but we still haven't been told why they worked on other projects instead of another expansion, why releases were delayed for other projects (contradicting the narrative they're trying to be faster), or why they decided to go two seasons in a row instead of sticking to the established system (which is now being rebranded *again*, this time as sagas). 
---
The thing that's so frustrating here is that there's a lot of good, small nuggets in this interview that are overshadowed by the lack of candid answers for why the motto is "faster, more efficient" but the action was diverting resources to other projects, delaying releases, and ignoring expansions. I don't doubt Anet has great ideas they were working on, but when players can very obviously tell that you've been neglecting expansion content and delaying releases, they're going to be upset when you don't explain how we got here and the main impression is that *this time* will be different.
---
Things might have changed from when I played, but it was certainly not that dramatic when I was playing a year ago or so.
---
The only time when you saw crazy high DPS numbers, is when people cheesed the results with adds or random buffs being focused on one player with an attempt at getting them to be the highest benchmark. It became such a problem that the benchmark site started accounting for this, to post what their DPS would be without the cheese.
---
There's just not a lot of room to fuck up in XIV. You either know your rotation and do around as much damage as you possibly can, or you don't, and hit combo skills out of order for some reason, and do no damage. Sure, there was classes like MCH that had more room to show off with because of how the class mechanic worked, but most classes had a very straight forward rotation and where designed around having that straight forward rotation.
---
There's also not really buffs that dramatically change DPS. At least not when I played. The DPS you can do on a training dummy solo, is pretty much the exact damage you can do on a boss. You don't really need to worry about if you have good supports with boon uptime or anything, so you can easily practice your rotation on any dummy.
---
Pretty much this.
---
I’ve also unlocked a good 3-4k gold worth skins off the chests, including some of those skull pauldrons, chaos weapons, shadow weapons, and a few weapons from just about every set.
---
I’ve probably saved nearly 1k gold just off primers in the last 2 years on expensive food.
---
Also, makes it easier to buyup a set of skins when they rotate in for free tickets.
---
Then there’s the makeover kits you used to get (RIP), and the exclusives.
---
I would never spend real money directly on them, but I view them for their utility with some pure gold return and occasiobal valuables.
---
&gt; I'm impressed with the graphics and environmental detail 
---
Is that why you cover the environmental detail with your gem stored mount, outfit and backpack?
---
Its just called arc?
---
Or arcdps?
---
Ascended gear can drop form anything that has a chance to drop exotic gear, even drop from chests scattered across the world  and at the end of jumping puzzles.  
---
If it doesn't happen anymore it would only mean they were generic rare drops, and got moved to rare unid gear.
---
You know Mattel could make a fortune on the gw2 whales, just create a Barbie dress up world as a game , and put all the clothes and sports cars in a cash shop...tada beautiful game.
---
The answer to answer all questions about magic and classes.
---
Thats exactly the problem. There is nothing to progress on in the game but fashion wars..how dumb are players?
---
But already have nvidia card... why bind myself to installing extra addons and keeping them updated? (This comment applies to majority of GW2 players based on market share info)
---
I wouldn't expect them to start an expansion until they finish the saga and see how it went. So I would expect either a content drought or another saga before another expansion releases.
---
They all use magic, even warriors enhance their abilities with magic.
---
My buddy put together a pretty helpful [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0If9rtWUJ5o&amp;feature=youtu.be) specifically for fractals, perhaps this will help!
---
I'd love to see proof of this, because it's not my experience.  You can get it from certain world bosses, sure. You can get it maybe from certain champ bags. I've never seen of or heard of an ascended piece of gear drop from a normal mob. Not in 7 years and 20,000 hours of game play.
---
i agree, but if you wanna supply this statement with a screenshot, you might want to hide your character...
---
These two things are incompatible:
---
A) Its the governments job to protect gamblers from themselves.
---
B) Scratch cards are sold openly in every convenience store.
---
Face it, the government doesn't act against gambling following some high minded ideals about protecting citizens, it just does not happen. If there is action against an industry because of gambling, either they pissed people off, they pissed a competing industry off, or the government wants a share of thr revenue.
---
And yes I'm only talking about an American perspective, I have no idea what gambling laws are in other countries. That's just being aware of my limitations in an argument.

"Best community" doesn't mean every member of the community is the best. It means the other communities have it worse.
---
If everyone else gets an F in their test, the one who gets an E- is the best. 
---
It's like with PvP.
---
GW2's PvP sucks. It's riddled with power creep, bad sportmanship, botters, cheaters, lack of diversity, slow balance, the combat pace and visual clutter makes it hostile to new players and bad to watch, and veterans only make things worse by being hostile to new and inexperience players and aiming their feedback into making the game even more hostile to new players (both knowingly and unknowingly), which results in  dwindling population that isn't being replenished at a decent pace, and thus longer queue times.  
---
Yet it's still the best PvP in any mmorpg out there. WoW, Black Desert, ESO... you name it, they are all worse.
---
The science is against you. Processed sugar is not just like any other food, calorie for calorie.

Imagine being so convinced that loot boxes are evil that you'll defend one of the main causes of the obesity epidemic because it makes your position look weak....
---
It was different phrasing. Talking about expansions he said:
---
&gt; MZ: I don’t think we have an answer for that one yet. For us, at least today, we know that with the stuff that we want to give – the quality of life improvements, the story we’re trying to tell – Icebrood Saga is the best way we can deliver free content to our players. Now, whether or not we change that method moving forward, we’ll have a different conversation at that point.
---
That's different from saying "We aren't talking about that today". The expansion question clearly identifies Sagas as the way forward for content delivery for GW2. It doesn't leave open the idea that they are currently working on an expansion. We aren't talking about that today is possibly something they are working on (which also includes a new mount, who honestly thinks there isn't a new mount somewhere in development already?).
---
It's very minor lore, they could easily say that we encouraged their ancient primal swimming skills or some other handwavey lore to make it happen.
---
Damn, overall I'm happy with what Mike Z talked about here and how he addressed issues. That is the only thing I wanted from them at the live stream. It was super disappointing not getting it then. This was a real talk. This was real communication Mike Z. I know the devs and many in the company feel burned from our reaction. This was all we needed to avoid that backlash. Real communication that addressed concerns regardless if the concerns were unfounded. 
---
Anet if you want to focus on community then talk to us like you're a part of this community. Talk to us like it's a one on one. We get shit is hard to do sometimes and there are delays. Not having proper communication becomes very frustrating when you feel invested in something and care about it. It can feel like we've been left in open water not knowing if a boat is coming or not when the main concerns about the game's future aren't addressed. Thank you for clarifying and communicating Mike Z.
---
It's what I always say: The only way to prevent bad behaviors is making them impossible. 
---
If people can have the chance to be assholes, they will be assholes. The more the game is changed to make that impossible, the better the experience, as players end up with two choices:
---
* Stop being an asshole.
---
* Leave the game. 
---
And both choices result in a steep reduction in the assholery levels.
---
I have seen it. People do it often.
---
I tried the nvidia option.  went back to reshade.
---
Imagine a condi necro with stat like power/vitalty/toughness, this is 90% of the playerbase because the game does not teach casuals how to play, and also most of them don't want to learn from the internet.
---
&gt;They're not gambling, because you can't cash out.
---
Regardless of whether that makes it fit the definition of gambling or not, doesn't that make loot boxes worse than "normal" gambling? If you can't ever make your money back, it's always a net loss. There are also games like csgo where you literally *can* cash out by selling the items you get from loot boxes.
---
Not every communication has to be an announcement of new plans. It's OK if they just regularly check in and say "this is still what's coming up" or "we hear your feedback about &lt;X&gt;. Our feeling about it is &lt;Y&gt;. We do not have a plan to announce yet, but you have been heard."
---
Wait until strikes have same loot as bounties. One blue and one green will be given where I can get killing trash mobs for 60sec in open world. I can do that instead of 5 min of annoying mechanics and players who have no clue.
---
Ever wondered why PoF maps are so abandoned? It's because of mechanics and trash loot.
---
Just saying, sometimes you don't have the choice. Think of that.
---
I mean, if that's all you need, why even bother playing MMOs? Gameplay is almost always inferior to single player games.
---
See I think this is a philosophical difference, especially since I'm not a gambking addict, but I would **imagine** that it's better for preventing addiction that you know for a fact you cant profit off of something. There's no way that **this key** is gonna be the one that makes all your money back. Once it's gone, it's gone. 
---
So keys aren't really gambling, in my mind. It's more like a crane game where you're guaranteed something, but it is likely to not be the thing you want, but it could be something really awesome.
---
Dude, some people had trouble with the "oil puzzle" in Thunderhead keep, and remember the whole NPE, people couldnt understand the 1st heart in queensdale, "hungry cow" and "cow food" was too hard !!
---
How not to do it.
---
Disappointing that conquest is the peak for them when it comes to structured PvP. It's a trash game mode suffering from call of duty Syndrome. I genuinely believe Stronghold is an infinitely better game-mode.
---
GW1's mesmer was a glorified curses necromancer with a serious case of caffeine abuse. 
---
They inspiration line didn't even inspire anyone for all gods' sake. Other than revealed/inspired hex, no skills were usable on allies.  
---
The mantras should have been wards instead stances, for example.  
---
A shame that they didn't come with the tech to make clones in GW1 until Winds of Change, and that they never used it to make mesmer skills into actual mesmer skills, and to make the GW1 Doppelganger actually transform into the player character.
---
Also a shame that they didn't keep up with the reworks. Elementalist, ritualist and dervish became way more fun after they got reworked with changes that gave their skills alternate uses and synergies that allowed using them in a few ways with different combinations.
---
Like it or not, this is something you would see in an xpac for others game, like new faces for character custom and so on. Those are not big features, but they still are.
---
I wish they kill aurene and start making elite specs one by one and releasing as soon as they are ready.
---
I'll
---
not-content content is something that is just there to play through once and gets forgotten after.
---
content-rich content is something that you re-experience over and over, so elite specs, new fractals with challenge modes, raids, dungeons. maybe even the new strike missions, if they of course add daily reward system for it. also new pvp modes, anything you can think of that will be replayed for rewards and fun (rewards and fun must go together or you create a niche activity)
---
&gt; The science is against you.
---
No, it's actually against *you*. Unproved theories aren't facts and what you said is *not* scientific proved.

Making your own items is often cheaper than buying them.
---
You just don't make a profit when you sell them because there's a 15% tax when you sell an item.
---
We need More information like this. Clear
---
And the checkpoints often bug out, too (or at least it's happened to me several times).
---
It's important if you are also using d912pxy. d912pxy doesn't officially play nice with other overlays that it hasn't approved. Reshade is officially approved with it, Nvidia's overlay works, but has a few bugs in regarding d912pxy that it shares with other overlays such as discord.
---
&gt;Why?
---
Because they're useless, that's the whole point, wow.
---
It’s literal, I used to sell raids and train people. My data found that most players who weren’t in my guild were at like 20% of their classes potential and that was the raiders not even your average pve player.
---
How dirty is someone's mind to consider a frog doing this as NSFW 🤔
---
You are right that this opens up new (and old) questions about their development process.  
---
I don't think we know exactly since when the development force was diverted towards other projects, one might speculate that it was during LS4 development, but from the comments of devs and ex devs, it seems like it happened before that, and that LS4 was made with the skeleton crew that left, probably the reason why they speak so passionately about its development, as they might feel it was a great feat considering how limited were the resources available they had. If this is the case, and they realized later during the development of LS4 that the scope of the story demanded more resources than what they anticipated, I can understand that bringing back some of the veteran developers and forming what seems to be a team and a half extra from what they had, might mean that they could keep the level from the last episodes of LS4, and deliver them more consistently.  
---
Of course even WITH the inside information it's hard to ascertain how that would go, as we have seen from their management.  
---
But given how ANet has operated during the past years, I believe that work on expected "expansion-like" features will begin shortly after the release of Episode 1, and we might see them delivered by episode 4 or 5, hopefully by episode 3 we will have world restructuring ready to be released. I hope that they don't tempt themselves at the middle of the saga to start stockpiling content for a possible expansion release, ultimately making this skip pointless and just a delay.
---
I mean, vore *does* exist.
---
I see build templates as salt in cooking: it's a flavor enhancer, but only if you already have something on your plate to eat.
---
I forgot to put the spoiler tag in the title
---
Believe it or not, it took ArenaNet a few years to condition players into loot boxes. Originally, there was huge outrage over Fused Weapon skins being loot box only.
---
Even if elite specs are part of what will be delivered with the saga, I don't think that they even know how to deliver them. It's not clear that the way to do so is to release all of them at once, it's not clear either that releasing them one by one is acceptable either.  
---
I wouldn't mind if they release all of them together, but incomplete (as in, for instance, with a single trait line, and add the rest of trait lines later).  
---
Or even if they should reconsider how expanding classes horizontally could be done in a way that is compatible with episodic releases. For instance, must it be a rule that expanding the available weapons for classes has to be tied to elite specs? what about expanding existing skill types?, must trait lines have only 3 options? how about a fourth line, or how about modifying existing elite specs to accomodate for a new way of delivery? Like separating the introduction of new weapons with the introduction of different class mechanics and traits.  
---
I agree though with elite specs (or expanding classes/gameplay) is the one defining aspect of an expansion, and perhaps, if we are to have expansion like features, it is this one in particular the one that they should provide above all else, even if they plan on delivering expansions later, they could very well focus on making the content that will be played instead of how it will be played.

 PVP/PVE Recommendations For Returning Player...
---
I'm interested in a class which can fill the side-node duelist 1vs1 role. (Ideally capable of respectable dungeon/raid DPS as well.) I have fond memories of 1vs1 duels with a Mesmer friend and planned on rolling the class. However, the profession seems like it's in an unstable position right now. What profession would you recommend given my interests (duelist 1vs1/pve) and the state of the game?
---
My preferences (no order):
---
Warrior
---
Theif
---
Mesmer?
---
Ele
---
Necro
---
There is mounting evidence to suggest that sugar is indeed addictive.  According to this 2018 study it meets 5 of the 11 "Substance Use Disorder" criteria from the DSM-5 and does indeed affect brain chemistry
---
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234835/
---
I'd think warrior, strong side node as spellbreaker, and DPS (berserker) or DPS/support (core) in PvE
---
It's the other way round.
---
Yes, people are actually that stupid. Luckily rare, but unfortunately vocal.
---
How do you even open them without buying one directly? In years i have never seen a key actually drop.
---
Gw2 is p2w confirmed xD
---
&gt;Magic: The Gathering card packs (both physical and digital) would be illegal by the same logic that called lootboxes gambling. They're marketed to children, they give random "value" for the same monetary input, and even worse than BL Chests, you can even exchange your cards for real money very easily! It's even closer to gambling than lootboxes.
---
This I do not quite understand. Where/who does the value of the card come from? As far as I can see, Wizard of the Coast does not sell them individually (unlike some Black Lion items available for direct purchase).
---
The platforms above the ship that suppose to shoot u forward (i mean the one where u have 2 in a row) are broken for me since months, i take the first one get shot to the second one but the second is broken shooting me forward the direction it suppose to but not far enough to reach where i have to land ,making me end up falling to my death.
---
I did this jp a lot of times whit my mesmer trying to help my friends but because of the broken jump pad it annoys me a lot and we just generaly avoid it
---
Cause that’s he was saying lol
---
I never tried at least never attempted to solo with my raid toons
---
you don't need data for everything. my reasonable assumptions still stand. i can use whatever is most logical, regardless of whether you don't like that or not. again, i am using logic, the fact that you don't like my conclusions is irrelevant. the only one fooling themself here is you
---
Neglected for years? Buddy, these people owe you N O T H I N G.
---
You've not been neglected, you just didn't get what you expected served on a silver platter.
---
I've had this problem too.
---
I’d love them to pick a section of the far shiverpeaks out and do just that
---
Sure, that would be "fun", but their wording made it sound like anything but being in active development.
---
I'd easily pay for Elite Specs honestly
---
didnt we just had friday the 13th?
---
It used to overshoot people instead o_O
---
You know what's strange? [*That\_Shaman datamined new color for hero points*](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1135474907465310208), same icons, but ice blue. If we aren't supposed to get new elite specs, why would they create new icons then?
---
&gt;It's not gambing though, gambling is putting money at risk with the intent to try and get more money. 
---
Close, but no. That's *one* type of gambling, but not the *only* type of gambling. The definition is more like:
---
putting [an item of value which *might* be money] at risk with the intent to try and get [an item of higher value which *might* be more money]
---
&gt;This is buying a product like a pack of cards, you could get good cards or bad.
---
And buying a pack of RNG cards *is* a form of gambling. Not *illegal* gambling in most jurisdictions, but still gambling. 
---
&gt;And anet needs them to funf the game, would you rather pay 10 dollars a month to play or have it be free to play with loot boxes. 
---
Any game that requires gambling to be profitable deserves to fail. I'm confident that ANet could balance their economy to function without gambling, offering the same products that players can currently acquire via gambling, through non-gambling methods. 
---
Just as an example, an "Endless Ocean Greatsword skin" is currently only available from ANet via lootbox gambling. It *is,* however, also available on the secondary market for ~42 Gold. You can buy 42 gold for roughly 175 gems. You can buy 175 gems for $2. 
---
So, ANet could sell that sword skin for $2, and people could buy it. Really, they could likely charge even more than that.
---
The thread that was put up was 3 days before the actual announcement.  Meaning they were gathering questions to be asked.
---
Good question. :D
---
that just looks.. just terrible.. like so much.  you removed all the detail -_-
---
thx. I guess I have keep waiting. -.-

I love your drawing :)

The only time you get any email update is when they respond.

Everyone who has played Bossblitz ones can clearly see its true.
---
Okay this doesn't make me feel as bad about my own reddit posts when top notch content that shows craftsmanship that took hours upon hours to make only gets a 60 percent upvote. But that begs the question... why all the downvotes?
---
They didn't even show build templates on their "big" livestream. Their little presentation can be recreated by anyone by just using a tome of knowledge at the same time as swapping weapons.
---
All they have showed was a person swapping weapons, and not any combination of weapons that would be hard to switch to by hand. 
---
 rifle &gt; prepare tome of knowledge confirmation &gt; manually switch to hammer and confirm quickly &gt; tress tab at the same time as using the tome to switch to sword + shield
---
All the weapons that can be used by core warrior. There wasn't a single time they showed switching between different one handed weapons, or switching from one elite spec weapon to the other.  So as far as i'm concerned, build templates don't exist at all. Don't have the ui ready? Just show us the placeholder ui then, what you are afraid of?
---
If you ever need a workout I uhh, know a place.
---
I did make an argument about loot boxes in the very response you replied to. You chose to ignore it.
---
You've also decided that you don't want to provide anything close to a coherent argument and have simply decided that it's easier to build a straw argument characterising myself as a gambler.
---
Try harder to address the actual points instead of attacking people otherwise you are going to run out of discussion partners.
---
No it's still a valid question. Because if their "we made a big event to show we're not done" results in players going "wait this is supposed to be considered big?" then it really does show that even their biggest upcoming changes are underwhelming.
---
When they've promised world restructuring for years, it's not too much to expect that they deliver on it.
---
&gt; yet you display nothing but passive-aggressiveness and snarky, sarcastic remarks. 
---
This is extremely funny, considering your response to me.
---
Prologue, Ep1, Ep2 and some mystery stuff by team4 are being in active development. It's entirely possible that they plan elite specs for Ep4, for example. I'd rather not get my hopes up however.
---
But they don't split the earth with a punch by sheer force of strength as well.
---
...I hope.
---
Sad that you think you are using logic.  You can't even acknowledge the logic of a bell curve.  You're fooling yourself.
---
You can still skip most of the puzzle with a few 🐰 bunny jumps
---
*If* they add Elite Specs with LS5, I really don't think they would start with the Prologue.  Mainly because the Prologue will always be free to everyone who owns Path of Fire, even those who don't log in between Tuesday and when Episode 1 launches.
---
Took me about two weeks to get my old account from launch. After my 5+ year break. In that time I just made a new account and now it’s my main.
---
This is my theory I think everything discussed so far was pre layoff. I think everything coming after episode 2 is when Anet and NCSoft said of we had a set back lets put 100% man power back into GW2 because it had suffered and even as a GW2 and Anet loyalist I'll admit GW2 suffered with delays. I think they want build templates out first I see those coming episode 1 or 2. Then a few months beta testing and maybe episode 4 or 5 in boom new elite specs what this does is it says GW2 is our main focus. Anyway thats my theory but obviously cynics have invaded this community so why try to reason with people.
---
I don't want it. I don't need it. But I'll get it anyway
---
&gt; But this is the thing, they can't please everyone.
---
Sure they can, its possible to have an arena pvp mode with different game types which doesn't fragment the community. Other games can do it why can't anet? Fragmentation is just an excuse for not putting more resources into pvp.
---
&gt;r/Guildwars2
---
pof and hot hero point icons are the same, why would they create new for ls5?
---
To be honest, it's just a series of dialogue and nothing more. Could easily be removed with minimal loss in the festival. Or better yet, Skarti or Sigfast VAs record new lines effectively replacing Knut's stuff.
---
If they had it in development at all. It would have been announced. Maybe next year.
---
Wrong, ESO and SWTOR do not have large pvp populations and its done in a way that the population is not fragmented in both.
---
arcdps but the community often just refers to it as arc
---
So what are the modes they offer, how do players divide their attention between those options, and how long are the queue times for each?
---
Probably because it is too official.  Right now, any communication from Anet that isn't about upcoming features/timelines is being downvoted.
---
The fact this even made it to the sub's front page means the craftsmanship was strong enough to overcome that hurdle.  If the creators on this sub, they should be proud they made it over 50% given the current climate.
---
Yea actually trying to open the chest is really painful. Best tip is use guardian and abuse the free aegis blocks where possible.
---
Overall, I am extremely pleased to see the results of that interview. However...
---
On the competitive side, I am only disheartened at the fact they believe that Conquest should be the Lonely Mountain of PVP. I realize that Guild Wars 1 had many game modes, but I really don't see the trouble with having more game modes in it, because the one game mode that we have right now is what people are avoiding.
---
I would love to see a Fort Aspenwood or a Jade Quarry style map in non-ranked or ranked, I don't care, and they get that they'll be doing different game types in the offseason, but the off Seasons only like two to three weeks or something... bah! I'll have to see how things are handled before I criticize it any further.
---
Though this might be a case of sufficiently advanced magic
---
Same, uninstalling helped.
---
Yes I would much rather switch to a checkpoint like system for all JP, just so all those no mount and no glider things go away.
---
Like in hoelbrak the spots where it just disables mounts in a seemingly random spot near the entrance...
---
My main problem with it was so many blind glides where you really can't be expected to guess which way to go without a lot of trial and error :(
---
These look so sweet!
---
Possible. 
---
I could still see them going back to expansions if they wanted to though. Here's how I see it, this season would be a huge disappointment if it were *just* "season 4," so they need to do at least a little more than that. On the other hand, I don't expect a full expansion either. 
---
To me, a full expansion would have an entirely new palette of environments (like the jungle, or the desert areas), a whole new mechanic (like gliding and mounts), *and* the elite specs, in addition to what we would expect from a "season." I think this "saga" will need at least some of that. 
---
I think it will tend to reuse design palettes from existing areas, probably not have huge new mechanics like the concept of mounts, but a set of elite specs? I think that's plausible. 
---
Then when they do a new expansion, it would need to be something bigger again, so Cantha, or the underground, or just a completely new palette of environments, some completely new mechanic to work with, and another set of elite specs. 
---
Now sure, maybe they will just do something brand new instead, but I'm not taking elite specs off the table just yet.

   This is actually a really important question when it comes to the entire lootbox discussion.  In the case of collectible card games like Magic the Gathering or Yu-gi-oh! the price attributed to the card is a reflection of its effective power in the game.  **Powerful cards are often capable of interacting with lots of other cards and act as a way of tying together a deck in much the same way a powerful trait can tie together a DPS or healing build.  Although it isn't always the case, most powerful cards are often dramatically less common in random card packs.**  You can easily find youtube videos where high-level players talk about why specific, high cost, cards are so strong, a good place to look would be the "Dragon Rulers" Yu-gi-oh! deck which had a value of over $1000 dollars at one point.
---
  This is also where /u/Skyy-High 's shlocky, hand-wringing argument falls apart.  Powerful trading cards are not valued as they are because of people ascribing them value based on personal preference (ex card art) but because they are designed to be of value in the first place by the game creator which is then recognized by the players of the game.  Just as a game developer would design a card with more value due to its power a video game developer can design an in-game item with more value by appealing to a universal sense of value that has been built into the game the lootboxes are included in. **It is important to understand that every successful lootbox mechanic has been designed in some way to interact with one or more major mechanics or systems in the game and in effect are a mechanic itself that can not be easily separated from the game it resides in.**  For example in Guild Wars 2, a.k.a Fasion Wars 2 the most common way players value an item is on its appearance, specifically how flashy and noticeable the item is to other players.  Items that replace animations, projectiles, add sound effects or dramatically change appearance make up the majority of all the high value items on the Trading Post.  In turn, most if not all cosmetic skins exclusive to Black Lion Chests feature unique animations, sound effects, and particle effects that stand out to other players which is what gives them value, and when you compare the price of a Black Lion Chest Key to that of a Gem Store skin the necessary differential in value to establish the gamble necessary for the lootbox to function as designed. This relation ship can of course be modified to accommodate many different types of games such as in a game that requires lots of farming, lootboxes should include items that benefit drop rates and allow you to carry more loot or should include cosmetic items that effect items that are frequently used during farming. By understanding the intention and specificity behind the development of lootboxes we can better resist their effects and define how they can be regulated legally.
---
sadly the answer is simply animation reuse.
---
i had hoped we'd get a evolution of the base destroyers from eye of the north, but barely anything has been as cool as the Great Destroyer.  (shout out to the Draconis Mons bosses)

... it's 4am, I'm up and awake (don't ask why) and now I want a croissant.  I was already thinking about a morning walk over to the local diner in a few hours.  *This isn't helping Reddit.* Thanks xD.  She's cute.
---
You have a good point.  It's interesting to see where the line falls between game and collectible in this instance. If the company hasn't printed a card in 25 years, it would be reasonable for it's price to rise as a sheer collectible even if it isn't "good" in the context of gameplay.
---
Regardless, it would take an enormous effort to restructure these games in such a way as to not appear exploitative or harm the local game stores that depend on that crowd. The buy-in price would need to be significant in order to make up the loss of booster sales.
---
Problem with GW2 is they are divided into disjointed teams that don't have a collective vision for how the entirety of the content and classes should interface with each other.
---
Every team only cares about their own pet project, and when people get shifted to another project the previous project just falls apart as none of the rest of the company is even remotely familiar or invested in what becomes of it.
---
I think that's my biggest problem with this. They have this attitude that's basically like "Oh, those things? Elite specs? Maybe those will be a thing; we'll see I guess ^it's ^not ^off ^the ^table ". To me that screams that they aren't even remotely self-aware, unless they're just being dishonest and downplaying the importance of them, which isn't any better.
---
Yeah, I already made a new account for the meantime. But I really want my old account back. I got both expansions and multiple 100$ worth in that account...
---
that sucks. All my previous tickets got resolved in the matter of a few days... didn't think a "simple" removal of 2FA would take THAT long...
---
So If I eat this croissant, do I get Joko's powers too?
---
Honestly, I didn't suppose that char=character might be not so obvious but okay, English is not my main language =). How should I call them? Toons?
---
Almost certainly because they just want alternate paths for people to unlock the current elite specs by playing current content. This is like an expansion to them in terms of a story reset and a new era of content, moving away from the PoF story. They probably don't want new players to have to go through "old" expansions to be able to play the new stuff.
---
Are these actually edible?  They look amazing!!
---
I could not eat that cutie. Impossible!

thanks for the full comment i think its very correct what you said :)
---
I only just finished living world season 4 this avo :)
---
One of the thing I love in gw2 that we have players helping other players. I also frequently guide new players, camping low lvl zones and VB just to help those who struggle with content. 
---
Is this a thing in other MMO? I feel like in other, people usually chase important grindy goals, having less time to just idle around. Here is the opposite. I already have BiS gear on a dozen of heroes so I just craft legendary items. I don't like grind so I just slowly do thing I consider fun at the moment and fill my time helping around.
---
Signets are magical items but the warriors themselves don't use magic of their own.
---
Yeah that's a good point. I don't personally like its visual, but it definitely is helpful for easily identifying who is being affected. Would be nice if stability had something similar.
---
Someone about to get branded.
---
Can you prove that most people wouldn't like team eliminations more than conquest?
---
WvW and PvP both need several layers of attention. Not adding a focus of more active support for the modes isn't going to positively influence retention.
---
What is the ideal outcome of pvp changes? More rewards? Skins? Gold? I'd wager this many years in most veterans aren't going to be moved or maintained by continued stagnation.
---
Isn't using magical items practicing magic?
---
How many CoNdI holos do you actually see in ranked?
---
You may already have heard this by now. But just in case you didn't, in an interview they (I think Mike Z) said that the Drakkar world boss would be like Triple Trouble-level of difficulty.
---
Is a new experience enjoyment - I got it with any new game I start playing -thats why I can put hour after hour into any new game (GW2 of course, but even any new AC, total war, Anno, Tomb Raider....), but after a while (finnish the game or put 100+ hours into it) its become just same old song - nice and fun, but same.
---
With MMOs is even worse then normal game -as you can have 100 hours in RNG and say you saw everything or most of it. But i have 11 000 + hours of gameplay of GW2 -not many things which makes me go OMG :)
---
There is option for us "veteras" too - I was thinking taking some of my toon to replay story from core or season 2 onwards - which are stories I didnt see in years now. But even that cant fuel you for long.
---
Its same as in real world - you can enjoy living on tropical island for quite some time - but there will be time you wake up, look around and see same white beaches, azure sea and shiny sun and goes -ok so what? Lets go to Canada. :D Sad but true :)
---
Truly. 
---
I mean, I get why, but I still hate that we've ended up losing a line related to the human race and rooted in the history of the franchise and replacing it with some generic catch-all "fire is hot so it will hurt you when you are exposed to it" boast.
---
ah yes, i remember a veteran helping me when i just started the game, we were swimming in the water and when i found out i could dive and swim underwater my mind was blown, i thought the visuals were so beautiful.
---
when i'm helping new players i sometimes take them to see shadow behemoth or jungle wurm to try and instill that same kind of awe i felt.
---
Ah, better than moot loot.
---
Set 2 legendary weapons were completed with the last episode, though.
---
&gt; ~1-2$ per elite in is not that huge IMO. Saving 1-2$ dollars per month (if elites would come in 9 months from now) is just drop of water. It is better for Anet if they sell it in package. Dividing it into single purchases is bad move for them.
---
It's not like I couldn't afford it, I'm just really touchy about "a fair deal." If something doesn't seem right to me, then it bothers me, even if I could afford it a thousand times over. 
---
I just don't think there would be a great way to release elite specs as a paid pack. 
---
&gt;Your hapiness is irrelevant. If they cared, they would never do loot boxes, etc. They are company, they need those profits. You need to compromise on some things sadly.
---
I can still express my viewpoint. Loot boxes are their own thing, but for the most part, you can sell more honey than vinegar, if you put out deals that seem fair, customers are more free with their wallet, where if you seem to be pulling one over on them, then they clam up.
---
For me, there is an intermediate level of excitement: the point where I discovered that in this game, I have access to top-level gear without raids which I never did in any other mmo. It's as exciting as the beginning of the game but in a different way. Then I was like "Oh, this place looks so cool." Now it's like "Oh, I can get XY piece of gear by doing something I like to do? Cool!"
---
&gt;Can you prove that most people wouldn't like team eliminations more than conquest?
---
Some definitely would. Some definitely wouldn't. Some wouldn't care. I have no idea the relative sizes of those three groups, but not one of them would be "zero." The community would split along those lines. Not necessarily "catastrophically," but there would be division. 
---
Some people liked the Desert Borderlands. 
---
&gt;WvW and PvP both need several layers of attention. 
---
Not really. I mean I'm sure WvW and PvPers would *appreciate* more attention, but that wouldn't be the best use of limited resources. 
---
&gt;What is the ideal outcome of pvp changes? More rewards? Skins? Gold? I'd wager this many years in most veterans aren't going to be moved or maintained by continued stagnation.
---
Nothing they do is likely to prevent the mode's gradual decline, but the best case scenario is for them to pursue the most positive attention they can gain for the least amount of effort. It's not worth investing too many resources overall.
---

Disable taxing filter. If used correctly it should barely make a dent in your FPS.

&gt;ESO has 5 modes and several maps with all modes being able to be played on all maps. It groups modes by types and allows players to queue for all or for a couple of different types. But the queue for different types and for fully random are the same. Hence no real fragmentation.
---
Wouldn't you still get players queuing *only* for specific types? That would still be fragmentation, even if *some* players queue for everything. If you turn that situation around, say that most of the players really only enjoy one of those modes, and really only want to queue for one of them, then they would still have a longer queue time than if everyone else was queuing for that same mode. 
---
&gt;SWTOR has a few different types and the queue is fully random or a ranked queue for just death match, result again no fragmentation.
---
But then people sometimes have to play modes that they do not enjoy. I remember back when GW2 queues sometimes forced you into Stronghold or deathmatch. It was annoying.
---
I left sometime around Heart of Thorns. Did thr game change a lot? I was mainly into sPvP and Fractals.
---
To be fair, that Amala screenshot has like 70+ players, in which case it's difficult to avoid visual clutter without super aggressive culling.
---
I experienced nostalgia recently when I was using my mount to get to a vista on an alt. In the past, you would spend a lot of time figuring out how to get to a vista or poi, and explored and jumped just on anything to get to it. And there was that feeling of accomplishment when you finally did. So sometimes I take an alt out to map explore, gather mats without any real goal and there's a sense of freedom when it isn't tied to an achievement.
---
No. If that was the case they would've said so. 
---
So, no. Stop the dreams so we don't get disappointed.
---
Some people enjoy checklists more than verdant pastures and pretty prose, which is perfectly fine and valid. But, yeah, once we've played the game long enough and become numb to the aspects we enjoy, it can be easy to think the game has gotten worse, and to start getting very particular about how the game should be, to try to bring some joy back into it in some other way.

I was playing HoT since its release. I finished the maps, events, stories already when my best friend decided to join me in game.
---
I took him to Dragons's Stand to help him gring some gold. I did not realise it was his firt DS event until---
---
I casually ran off the cliff, glided to the islands without any excitement and just jumped on the boss -
---
WHILE he was literally screaming in excitement and joy: oh my god what is that thingy, oh my gosh this loooooooks so cool. Dont go there! It will kill you! Oh my god! This is amazing! *shaking, screaming*
---
And when the boss flew up I had time to feel again... And it felt so bad. He saw something I used to see too... But not anymore. I did that meta so many times, every spawn point, pods, mushrooms, no cc, glide...like muscle memory...
---
sorry for my bad england
---
For starters, you definitely won't need heavy and light armor pieces. You can either salvage them or sell to any vendor.  
---
There is also no need to keep anything under lvl 80, because, at this point, you will level up fast, and find far better equipement to use.  
---
Additionally, bigger bags (20 slot ones) are not that expensive (approximately 11g on tp atm). You have 10 gold, you are not that far from being able to buy one and change it with 8 slot one.  
---
Other rubbish like tools (i don't think you need that many spare ones), meta rush rewards like banners and  [Pact Scout's Mapping Materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Scout%27s_Mapping_Materials), would be better off stored in the bank alongside with boosts or shared with others (banners).
---
I would be okay with them being regulated too. I fell victim to the tcg gambling when I was a kid.
---
That's a whole lot of words to say that Mtg cards are P2W while GW2 skins are often pay to look better.
---
You failed to make an argument for how a) that difference would allow a government to legalize one without the other, or b) how it's more socially acceptable to base an entire game around a random P2W mechanic, but unethical to have **one avenue** of cosmetic improvement in GW2 be dependant on rng. Because for all the histrionics, I think people generally forget that there are very few items exclusive to BLChests, and often the few that start exclusive come back with the guaranteed statuettes later. You by no means need to roll the dice to get a BL weapon skin, for instance. Many of them are fairly cheap on the TP.
---
TLDR: you pointed out one difference between MtG cards and loot boxes, and then sat back and considered your argument complete. No. You're gonna have to do more than simply acknowledging that rng mechanics are designed around the game that they appear in.

Congrats!!
---
I think what has changed is that since mounts, everyone got addicted to the use of them. Always taking the easy mode, running,  Jumping and flying everwhere. It takes away the skill and excitement of climbing things. I notice it for myself also, its becoming the standard if you use it constantly. Theres also less social interaction compared to earlier gw 2 days because everybody is in hyper mount mode, hastely underway all the time.
---
S1 was the Golden Age of GW2. There will never be anything like it again. Even if it comes back. Why wasn't the Siege of Divinity's Reach a huge thing like the Siege of Lion's Arch? Because it was just a throwaway map, confined and without any repercussions or consequences.
---
You can copy the S1's content, you won't be able to catch its mood and the way it felt.
---
New people will just grind through it like they grind through Dragonfall.

Salvage Equipment that are green and blue to get materials.
---
Handling Rare (yellow) or exotic (orange) equipment is a bit different and depends on a few things to be totally efficient.
---
First and foremost, most rare or exotic items can drop an Item called "Glob of Ectoplasm" which is used for a few things that you might need later like ascended crafting or you can also sell them. There is no 100% chance to get the Ecto out of those items and it also depends on what salvage kit you use. I salvage my rare items with the mystic salvage kit and the exotic with the black lion salvage kit.
---
To know when to salvage and when to sell you would need to go through the following steps:
---
1. check the price of the item on the trading post
---
2. check the price of the "Glob of Ectoplasm" on the trading post
---
3. [find the average salvage of ectos depending on the salvage kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glob_of_Ectoplasm#Salvaging_2)
---
4. compare the "price per ecto" to the average you might get from the item
---
if the price of the ecto is below what you can get by selling it directly on the trading post then selling it on the TP is better, if it is higher then salvaging it might be better.
---
However, it really depends on how many ectos you pull from those items and what kit you use, a lower kit will salvage less and lower amounts of materials while a better kit costs more but salvages better and more materials.
---
Every game has this period. Single player *or* MMO. ***Every single one***. And you know what else? Everything in life has this, every little tiny thing.
---
I'll be honest, I don't really like your phrasing in the title. "Something changed" isn't accurate. *Nothing* changed. The game/thing(s) just stopped being new.
---
Honeymoon periods, that's what they are. When things are new and they're fresh and you look at them with fresh eyes and you can only see the wonder and feel the excitement because it's all *different* and there's a *wealth* of opportunity just around the corner! Every Vista looks beautiful and you watch the cutscenes! A Point of Interest could be *anywhere* so exploring is always rewarding! New ambient dialogue you've never heard of - and even the enemies have ambient dialogue, so maybe you wait for a few minutes to kill them! Totally new stories with all new characters; who are they? What do they do? What's your place in the story? New classes that feel fun to unlock - holy shit guys, Endure Pain makes me *literally invulnerable*! - oh my god this greatsword is actually really cool on Mesmer! - I just found a new Ranger pet!
---
And then... you've done it all. Nothing has *changed*. Just, nothing is *new*. You know where the PoI are now - they're never going to move or change. They're just... there. You know what the vista cutscenes look like, re-watching really won't show you something you haven't seen before. You unlocked a class entirely *and* its elite specialisations, and you've worked out that most builds are either Beserker or Vipers and there's rarely deviation from that. You've done all the dungeons. You've done all the fractals - through all their tiers, too. 
---
Honeymoon periods never last. Things always grow old. Things always grow stale. And this doesn't just happen in games either. Nothing *changes*, you just get used to it. And the bitterest reality of all: the more time you spend with something, the more you see the flaws and how they can annoy you or even frustrate you. Relationships break because of this ***all the time***. Things that used to be cute quirks of your partner become irritating to deal with. The things that they used to do that annoyed you slightly, now they annoy you every single day because you're living together with them and you just didn't realise how often they did X or Y that annoyed you. It can become more difficult to find *new* things to do and you both just get set into a rhythm. We don't necessarily build a relationship with games in the same way but the underlying principle is exactly the same: when you've exhausted the honeymoon period and you play for longer periods of time, you start to see the things you never used to notice. It isn't that they weren't there. It isn't that *they* changed. It isn't that *you* changed. You were just able to notice them because "new" doesn't last forever.
---
Got voice in the void, didn't learn printscreen :(
---
No, absolutely not, at level 80 blue, green and even rare equip is worthless since you can easily get yourself a full exotic set.
---
I can no longer when shitty photos are done on purpose for the meme.
---
Please help.
---
&gt;If it results in making the whole game easier down the line, yes it's a bad idea. 
---
Why, when most players prefer the easier game? 
---
&gt;If nothing is challenging it's not worth playing.
---
Perhaps not for you, but considering that the overwhelming majority of the players don't raid, the overwhelming majority of the players disagree with you. If it comes down to whether support should be given to players who feel "If nothing is challenging it's not worth playing," or supporting everyone else, they are better off supporting everyone else, right?
---
I had to look at your skill bar to realize it's the Rifle you talk about :D
---
12k hours in and I still get excited about ambient dialog. I keep finding stuff I've never heard before! How much did they write?!
---
I have to heavily disagree here. Kalla elite spirit is NOT that powerfull of a dps tool. Its mainly used to keep scholar while adding some damage in no healer comps. Its not that useful if you have a healer or everyone has scholar.
---
I often see pug rens have close to no or healer dps when they could have decent. I sometimes manage to outdps the average pug warr as ren aswell. Part of this problem is the super outdated and bad dT guide that still suggests to keep up kalla at all costs.
---
The raid rotation is basically never used in fractals because you want to use all your hard hitting attacks into a breakbar. Optimal ren rotation in fractals highly depends on group dps because of that.
---
You can precast darkrazor + icerazor and swap to shiro for burst on some bosses like skorvald. Please focus on keeping alacrity and might but don't forget to dps. Most pug rens i see only aa most of the time and if you can run shiro because there are no boons/condis to strip, ventari bubble isnt needed or you have a heal fb for stab do it! Its a lot of dps you lose for redundant support.
---
Ren can have 70k dps skorvald first phase. Also jalis stability only gets applied to teammates once the road is build so keep that in mind when you try to use it. It's not instant like fb stab.
---
FFXIV has minor ambient dialogue in the form of text boxes over some NPCs. None of it is voiced and it's not very frequent, but it exsts.
---
As somebody who started with GW2, loved it dearly, and then moved to FFXIV, I can say that by the time I hit level 50 in FFXIV I felt it was the better game. By the time I hit 60 and started doing the Heavensward content, I was sold that FFXIV was just generally a better MMORPG in almost every way. The game had a better sense of direction, and it's more traditional nature meant the developers could focus on making engaging encounters (as well as creating the harder versions of those encounters) instead of constantly feeling the need to come up with new stat combinations or elite specialisations. Some manner of tutorials for how to play your classes efficiently and properly combo up skills. At lower and early levels, FFXIV combat feels slower and less gratifying because you have little to work with, but it only gets progressively better as you level up and gain access to more kit.
---
To some degree, GW2 vs any other traditional MMORPG will always be apples and oranges, especially in combat. But as a veteran of GW2, the reality of combat is that it is stale. Three expansions and Berserker is still arguably the biggest meta build, now alongside Vipers and very rarely anything else in most content. Healers and tanks oddly and weirdly shoehorned in to try and recreate a "trinity" back when they made raids. Inconsistent evade system which is especially noticeable on evade-heavy classes. Visual clutter and sometimes incredibly poor telegraphs. ***Literally*** zero training in any way on how to use a class optimally - which is so bad in GW2 that even the developers have since admitted that the difference in DPS between an "average" player and then a raider is in the ***tens of thousands***. GW2 was built on concepts that felt groundbreaking seven years ago, but as time has gone on, it hasn't withstood the test of time the same way that traditional Trinity-grounded MMOs have done.
---
But but... Raids are so hard to get into?? /S
---
Please don't use the excuse "but this is a joke, a caricature of the posts we get all the time". This excuse has been used so many times, it doesn't work anymore. At this point you can make a proper printscreen and post it with the excuse that it's there to make fun of the numerous posts that used the above excuse.
---
*Sweats profusely*
---
I may be an outlier but I actually still experience something I think quite close to the newbie excitement whenever a new story or new map comes out. I literally just run around and sit staring at the scenery, enjoy the music, stop at beautiful places etc.
---
Getting POIs or vistas doesn't feel as rewarding as it used to, but there's still some sparkly-eyed magic, even in areas I already completed several times. Special shout-out to HoT maps. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

IMO, the only reason I don’t play as often is because the personal story isn’t as interesting to replay. I love most of it, but once Trehearne(?) is introduced it becomes less fun. Combined with the fact that my friend has trouble getting it to run due to firewall blocks and limited time, it can be hard to return to and expect the occupation of space to be long-term. All that said, I definitely consider GW2 to be the overall best MMO out there. It came into my life at a time when video games were really something to celebrate, and for that it holds a special place in my heart.
---
no. Updating is fine just don't submit a new ticket, THAT is what it sends to the end of the queue.
---
Hell yeah he is
---
i'm surprised you remember my nickname. i've had bad experience with lfg, but i did find a guild willing to let me in. not as difficult as i thought, i admit.
---
i also like pokemon
---
Ahh I gotcha
---
ye this guy knows his shit^
---
It is not about gankers as people would like to think it is. It is a lot more then that. So ok let me spend some time to explain,
---
If you are a roamer on the mount the first that disengage have the lower hand which sometimes create stale fights were you riding along side waiting for the other. It is stupid. 
---
Thiefs who before had shortbow 5 to use now have a unlimited amounts of running away and that is what they do. With thiefs on a mount i don't even bother to get off unless he do and get me off the mount. I simply run with them on my mount until they get bored and wp. Because no matter what if they go low they will shortbow away and then mount up because they are out of combat whilst i am not because reasons... 
---
And then there are the players who ruins a fighting zerg. They run with the comander but they dont want to get of the mount. And the comander plays with veils which you wont get stealth on a mount (and you should not so dont read that as if you should) and the players on the mount move with com through the veil still visible showing exactly were we are. We tell them to stop, do they listen? Ofc not. Some are even players from the oposing server that just want to show were we are.
---
Then we have the roamers on the mount who just want to take stuff. So they are spending their whole day on the mount. And we can 1. chaise him for hours trying to get him off the mount or we can let them take everything because we can't be arsed follow someone around. 
---
These are all players who intend to take things from you or fight you but the mount make the game play dumb and frustrating because who wants to follow a thief around the map for hours?
---
And then we also have the players that before was fighting and could fight and counter are simply just lazy and breezing through roamers he normally would have fought just again lazy and roamers miss out on fights and get less and less to do.
---
So were you smile at that one thief in which that mount would be a good addition and ok to use, what about the other thounsands of times every day on every server were the mount simply bypass things that should not be bypassed because they have been a part of WvW for over 6 years and been something WvW was worth playing for many players. 
---
Are you also aware of that a lot of people stopped playing the game just because of that? And i am not talking about gankers, i talk about normal wvw game play being bypassed making WvW less active.
---
So in my personal opinion the mounts should not be untouchable. It anything it should have a breakbar at least and that tech is already there because banner people have a break bar so it is not hard for them to implement. As it is now the mount have no such thing and also 3 dodges and very few classes have damage that are able to hit because of the movements. Some classes have a condiburst but still it have to hit and again 3 dodges and you are out of their range. 
---
The only thing Arena Net decided to give us is a skill on the ballista that do indeed dismount but 1. you can not carry enough supplies to build one ballista on your own. 2. Even if you could unmounting building a balista takes so long that the person you want to unmount is already on the other side of the map when the ballista is finally up. So their fix changed nothing and the fixes they talked about is traps, so that again means supplies and stop and placing it so nothing you can do in the moment you need it. 
---
Breakbar, add it!
---
update from ArenaNet will trigger an email but OP updated their ticket so there shouldn't be a reason to send an email with that information.
---
Usually, after creating you will get an email that they received your ticket (which is automated) and then you have to wait until they can process the ticket.
---
It’s a shame you made it for a DE. That’s the meme itself. (I play DE tho) but people cry over it haha.
---
You can so it, make sure to make a post like mine when u finally get one!
---
For me it looks bad because i cant really see anything other than light splashes. Amala isnt even the worst offender. Every Palawadan meta looks like this:

---
wow....thanks......
---
Well then, don't chase?
---
I try desperately to stay in the first style, even if turn to make me stay away from the end game. I think I'm in a comfortable middle ground
---
It also goes the other way around, anet does not explain combat, stats, condi and boons well to new players who just see enemy die and not look into rotations and and combos.
---
On the other hand we have try hards and super invested players who spend hours looking into trait line and work out synergies between the traits, armour, runes, weapons and sigils. I have personally spent hours doing nothing but trying builds and checking what works best and how to min-max my output. New and casual players play the game for little time than study the game as hardcore players do. There will definitely be be skill disparity, I am not really surprised by the 10x difference here considering how invested people are.
---
Can you provide a screenshot?
---
My man, that open world grind paid off. Dont forget to post your 2nd and third legendaries with the same high level of quality
---
&gt; not as difficult as i thought, i admit. 
---
That's a wrap folks! He said the thing! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Congrats! Seriously.
---
Legendary disappointment when people realize that there is barely anything to do, because it's not a full episode and only prologue
---
Honestly, it’s always refreshing to see someone new to the game actually be able to enjoy raids, let alone getting into them and expressing so on Reddit, we could use more posts like this,imo. 
---
Congrats on the kills, keep’em coming.

Myself and a friend of mine each planted ascended crops in our respective homes at the same time. We both missed gathering them the next day. On the second day, when we went to gather them, my friend's plants were not there and mine were. I know for a fact that my friend did not gather on that plot in another home instance. Seems like a bug to me.
---
They aren't dumbing down the content. Strikes are a way to get players into raids.
---
Because something is fun when it’s new and exciting.  Not so much when it’s the tenth (and honestly with this type of content second or third) time when you’ve done it.  Unfortunately we have had very little in the ways of new and exciting stuff in the types of content like jumping puzzles and vistas.  And one they lose that fresh appeal...  it’s just another grind
---
Just having better ways to find guilds / promote guilds in game would've gone a long way. But that being said, I don't think strikes are a waste of money nor resources. It's different content for a different audience.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Plenty people just want non braindead content over having to fix a proper group. We'll see how it turns out.
---
Fuck. Yes. This video has made me /cry/ in emotions about GW2 and HoT so many times..... It's so fucking good.
---
Oh... oh my...
---
Events give experience, not coin. Doing three daily *achievements* that aren't specific to a map will give you a fourth daily achievement that awards 2 gold.
---
TIL gem exchange isn't allowed?
---
If you're looking to do that during 1-80 you'll be quite disappointed, the game is super easy. You could go for core map completion, but that would just take longer.
---
This isn't the best game for this kind of challenge.
---
For years I thought I was the only one. It doesn't  get easier, just try to get past your desire to main a male Sylvari.
---
Mounts helped a little but not as much as I hoped.
---
Forgot the 0 deaths part. :P My bad!
---
it wasn't difficult as such, i did have to adjust my playstyle to be much more cautious than i otherwise would be, and didnt take big risks. I dont think i could do it in group content at all
---
Don't be an ass Stacy
---
Just because they disagree, and they're the majority doesn't mean it's the right decision for the game. It's okay to have content in the game you cannot beat. 
---
You may just not get it and that's fine, but since I've played WoW through all it's iterations, just know, it can be very bad for the game when that train of thought is introduced and acted upon.
---
I knew someone who did a " pacifism " challenge where they had to complete their personal story without killing anything themselves.
---
And you think the map could hold a candle to Lion's Arch if Anet would've put a burning version of DR into it?
---
Interesting. I started playing GW2 after years of WoW and I have definitely felt this honeymoon period in GW2 myself.
---
I feel exactly the same. Sure mounts to instantly get my daily vistas are nice. But I miss the little challenges of exploration, the early excitement from the release. Everything was new and terrific. Now all those new currencies and crap just feel like bloatware instead of fresh stuff to look forward to. Arrh
---
Inb4 icon rework 🤣
---
To get carried is the answer
---
Wtf were these actual traits?
---
This is why we can't have nice things :(.
---
Wooden potatoes finished the personal story without casting a single skill.. Just start raiding or smth
---
Looking for guild / looking for members tool would help a lot with raids and wvw and casual playing.
---
Becky lemme smaaash
---
same vermin that gets carried in open world encounters by raiders doing over 10 times their dps
---
Perfectly. A full siege where the White Mantle begins outside the walls, then starts pushing on. We could get current Lake Doric, a section of Queensdale, and some land west of DR as well. The final result would be roughly the size of Elon Riverlands.
---
This is why I always try to do nonsense which is not necessarily part of the designed experience. See if I can climb that tree over there. Dueling with friends in PvP using silly builds. Standing around for hours talking bullshit with strangers, some of them might become friends. And I think I spent the most time in-game making music rather than anything to do with achievement goals.
---
Welp, guess I'll give the bloody legendary ring a try after all. Now all I need is a guild willing to carry me.
---
I did a white gear only, death is death, no waypoints run for a while. I enjoyed it a lot but don't quite ever feel like to want to go back to it. 
---
The base game is, for an experienced player, rather easy. Deliberately limiting your gear adds a huge level of challenge.
---
Sounds hilarious to me. I couldn't imagine *yet another meta* being able to compete in any way with the destruction and re-capture of Lion's Arch.
---
You did fine bud. Just was me thinking you were talking about the char race in game
---
I dont think anyone cries if fallen plays de though
---
They didn't wanted to do them because they set bar too high. These "journeys" to obtain precursor required many dev resources for that. Once they dropped it, it became easy for them to create them. Experimental, perfected and precursor weapons released since LS3E2 only for devs to make weapons and visual effects. No journey, dialogue, events, NPC, etc. 
---
I don't see a reason why they should stop doing them.
---
Isnt that the point?????
---
not really, they work on strikes, who will be bounty2.0, aka more casual then the rest of the game,  and dont work on new raids, so they will bring in more casual content instead of less
---
if i buy the standard pack usd29.99, can i pay usd25.00 later to upgrade it to deluxe or usd50.00 more to upgrade it to ultimate pack??
---
i like the game but i found the deluxe and ulitmate pack is just provide some convenience. not so sure whether i need them right now so asking this question. 
---
thanks in advance
---
They ARE actual traits. Meta traits, the guardian one only partially.
---
Should have rotated the image by 90 degrees
---
Yes, that's exactly the point. Which is why it's a great delivery of the joke.

Wouldn't want someone to hold that firmly... look at dem tight grips. Ow. That golem dps grinding paid off.
---
&gt; i cant earn gold after finishing daily events
---
You should get 2 gold after doing any three of the daily events, however, I think this does not apply to free2play characters. Are you? Did you buy either the core game or any extension?
---
No, they absolutely used magic.
---
The company already sells gold for real money, so you will have a hard time doing that here. To get more gold you need to hit max level.
---
Just no. And I believe your assertion
---
&gt; It was to sell skins
---
might be true, but certainly not the whole truth. It vitalized WvW a lot: you don't have to spend sooo much time running back to the fight anymore.
---
They are just convenience items, ultimately. Nothing you can't live without. 
---
There's are a couple of bundles in the gem store that give you something similar.
---
Yes you can buy deluxe later in the gem store whenever you want.
---
You get carried first few times, you learn, you carry other noobs. That's how it works. No one went to raids with full knowledge about everything and without a single mechanic fail.
---
My training group cleared 3 wings in 2 nights with 7-9 newbies who had no idea how half of these bosses worked (because no one expected to clear that many bosses in such a short time and we read guides on only 1-2 bosses). A few weeks later i was the one of those 1-3 exp people who were helping other inexperienced people.
---
People in this game are usually pretty helpful and if you ask them to buy you something from the TP, they will usually help you out. If you can't find anyone to help you, just PM me and I'll help you out (within reason of course, I'm not super rich). Goes for any other player out there that needs help.
---
Instead we get all content being developed for  "not so good ones".
---
I cannot sell to players a i have not yet bought the expansions.:(
---
I know roamers really hate mounts, but this would just make it kind of annoying to have a mount at all.
---
&gt; I think it's worth grabbing one of each of the backpacks from Siren's Landing for the skins.
---
This one is probably the best for backpacks since once you get Balthazar's, Lyssa's, Grenth's, Dwayna's and Melandru's backpacks, you get Abaddon's as rewards (achievement).
---
I played ele on 10 fps and had no problem getting 700+LI, commanding groups with more LI than I had (back when I started, most lfg groups had 50-100 LI while I had 10-20), nor problems with being top dps on any of the tempest and condi engi builds that were meta throughout whole HoT.
---
Sure it's harder than playing a daredevil with 50 fps, but it's not quite hard. A lot of mechanics can be predicted and having 5% less dps than you could if you had better fps means absolutely nothing.
---
So what bosses are left to be killed with only 5 man so that we can say raids are are just one group content? Guess Xera is impossible because you need 6 for prevent, what about Dhuum and Qadim?
---
How did that work for specific story instances?
---
Haha the comments in this thread \#bestcommunity
---
and another question is ther any way for making money from gw2?
---
I played Vanilla when is was current, and I also came back for WoW Classic. Refunded within a day. I also played on 2 different private servers before Classic, so I guess I was already kinda burnt out on it. The only reason I came back and resubbed was because I saw streamers play it, and unfortunately the streamer servers have 50k+ queues. Every other server is kinda empty-ish or not many people chat. 
---
There is nothing GW2 can learn from Classic. Absolutely nothing. Classic is a 15 year old game with outdated graphics and mechanics. GW1 is still around, so unless they wanted to gut it and bring it back for nostalgia's sake, there's really nothing to be else to be done
---
You idea will result in black market gambling and a situation which is worse than legal gambling, identical to the drug war.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-\_LitBxl\_UE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_LitBxl_UE)
---
in gw1 they had a (very) slight effect.
---
" They are affected by [skill](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skill) effects (e.g. [Earthquake](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Earthquake) or ["You're All Alone!"](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22You%27re_All_Alone!%22)), and they boost skills that increase in power through the number of allies within range (e.g. [Leader's Comfort](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Leader%27s_Comfort)). "
---
I'm an old raider, but I never kept kps due to having a static group. Now I need to pug my way through and I need to explain to commanders that I have killed dhuum like 50 times, although I only have 1 kp. don't throw the important ones away!
---
The rules say that minions, turrets and elementals, and anything used in defense (reflection , etc) are fair game but you can't attack anything directly .
---
&gt; No one went to raids with full knowledge about everything and without a single mechanic fail.
---
You can go into raids with full knowledge about them, but knowledge doesn't equate into practical experience on how to execute said knowledge.
---
From or in Gw2?
---
 From sounds as if you're looking to sell or buy a service.
---
 In sounds like youre looking for ways to farm gold inside and pertaining to game play.
---
Which one are you aiming for?
---
But the argument isn't that Warriors are wizards or intrinsically have magical capabilities or anything. It is that like other classes, Warrior use magic in combat.
---
Like in Skyrim terms, whether you use mana to cast Firebolt or buy or craft a Staff that casts Firebolt doesn't make a difference in the outcome. We would be casting Firebolt, a magic spell, either way. The second character would be reliant on their Staff to cast Firebolt, but it doesn't change the fact that both characters use magic spells in combat.
---
Returning back to gw2, the fact that Warriors can use Signets to produce magical effects (boons, buffs etc) suggest that they do use magic in combat. They don't need to know how the Signet or be a wizard, and yet they can still use magic.
---
Is it that Xbox thingy what was running in background when gaming? No wonder I didn't know it's existence: When I had Win10 before moving back to Win7, the very first thing I did after installing fresh Win10 was to uninstall every single app trough a PowerShell command: Get-AppxPackage -allusers | Remove-AppxPackage
---
"they're not ruling it out, but they're not talking about it right now."
---
just copypaste this for any question you have about gw2, pretend its interview with their game designer. should be accurate 99% of time
---
when I started raiding, me and a friend read up on each boss and watched videos, made a training group for a few hours and then searched for 50+ kp people for the kill. killing all bosses took a bit more than a week.
---
legendary uninstall
---
&gt;You can copy the S1's content, you won't be able to catch its mood and the way it felt.
---
Feeling is irrelevant. At **most** only 30% of the player base actually know what "it felt like". The actual number is lower and continues to lower as time goes on as more new players accrue over time while player who were at S1 can only decline.  ["Living World Season 1 - Should it be back?"](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/29663/living-world-season-1-should-it-be-back)  At **most**
---
Playing since 2012, haven't even tried raiding and I feel quite jealous right now :D good for you
---
I think it will be very hard to. The most reliable would be to sell Raid runs (you need a guild)
---
Pretty much.
---
Well, that way everybody can play the new content.
---
Ah, that is interesting! My guess would maybe be that GW2 is a more immersive game? It has more ambient dialogue and it doesn’t have the cartoony style of WoW, so going from WoW to GW2 might be an “upgrade” in terms of how immersive the game is? 
---
From my POV, when going from GW2 to WoW (or FFXIV for that matter) it’s somewhat of a “downgrade” from GW2, and so it doesn’t bring that feeling of immersing yourself in a new world.
---
The giant screwdriver
---
&gt; Feeling is irrelevant
---
And that's where we already start to have completely different opinions. All that reminiscence? Pure feeling. Yes, more content is great by default and S1 had great content, so by definition it'd be great to have it back. But it'd just be the content. It wouldn't be the *same*. S1 is what it is because it's gone. Bring it back and it's just another piece of content do be quantified, optimized and farmed to death.
---
US did 5 man dhuum \^\_\^
---
I would say weaponsmith and tailoring. Tailoring for the light armor and weaponsmith for swords/shields/greatsword, etc.
---
Well, for instance, I never play weaver, or scrapper, or spell breaker, so those releases would be useless to me.  I know plenty of other people play those classes, but you're wrong if you think everyone plays every class.  Releasing elite specs 1 at a time is a deeply flawed idea.
---
That "forced" part is one of things why many players don't want to try raiding.
---
Forced rotation, skills, traits, gear, aka "meta"... they kill the boss, but they also kill freedom and in many cases, fun. Raid bosses can be killed with much less DPS what can be achieved with today's meta builds.
---
I'd love to be walking along a new map and suddenly come across some difficult legendary boss that you'd need a group of people for, or extreme patience if you want to solo it. It's okay if a new player comes across it and does not know what to do because it would make them learn how to play the game to beat it. And for the love of Aurene make it drop something neat.
---
I just crafted vision and coalescence and I can’t disagree more
---
350 of lws4 mats just for vision not to mention the istan  and thunderhead weapon crafting for vision 
---
Then there’s the funerary incense for both.
---
Not complaining just pointing out the material sinks for both
---
You have that feeling nobody can take it away.
---
And 70-80% of players in GW2 **don't want** that feeling.
---
They want to know "What the hell happened" and "who are these strangers all calling me 'Boss', I though I was the Commander."
---
in gw2
---
To me it's a combination of 3 factors:
---
New sights: Map/world competition is a double edged sword in that it gets you out to see what is all in the zone, but then you are left feeling like you've seen it all, oh this map is entirely checked off, guess I've seen it all becomes the additude, and I find myself avoiding revisiting that stuff, until something sends me back there and I go... oh wait it's been like years since I was here I don't actually remember all of this. But on the other hand I find myself revisiting the same areas a lot because there is stuff in acheivement or daily checkboxes to do there.
---
Settling into a build is kinda the same way... 3 utilities skills is not a lot of variety and because of that very limited space, while there are a lot of very cool skills to play around with... I find myself always gravitating back to just playing with the same 3 skills that feel kinda mandatory or optimal on my bar 90% of the time, so after the initial experimentation I'm not really getting to play with many of the available skills. Man, what I would do for a 4th utility slot...
---
Rewards, it takes very, very little time to be in full rare, and not a great deal of effort to be in full exotic gear, but rewards in the open world are tons and tons of trash blues, greens &amp; yellows. In a session of play I'm lucky to see 1 or 2 exotics, or 1 appearance unlock. But I commonly find each time I stop to check on my bags I've gathered 80 to 120 blues, 50 to 90 greens and 21 to 50 yellows that are all basicly trash or salvage. You go from inspecting every drop for an upgrade to throwing out thousands of peices of gear without so much as a sideways glance. Salvage All. While on the other hand after a certain, anything new or exciting that you can earn always seems daunting far away.
---
The biggest factor for me though is friends... I started playing the game with several local friends and we would sit in the same room and play together, but over time most of them have drifted away from the game or are just busy with other stuff, so I went from playing very much as a social thing with a group to solo for the majority of what I'm doing.
---
Good news, thank you for the reminder.
---
Yeah I remember this article, unfortunately it's super old (like, first year of game old) and I'll be damned if I remember what site it was on.
---
I have to disagree. You dont play those classes because they dont interest you: absolutely fair. But if they release 1 spec at a time, we all get to at least try it and see if we like it. I hated necro, and then I mained reaper all of HoT. That's the point of elite specs, it changes a class around. Releasing them 1 at a time adds content, and eases balancing. 
---
And I dont claim everyone has 9 alts. But every has access to all 9 classes. No one "gets theirs last". We all get access to every spec, whether we like them or not.
---
Ultimate version just gives discounter gems compared to deluxe so you cant get it in game or after your initial purchase. Deluxe is available in gem store though.

---
Funny enough, I started playing WoW Classic with some friends and have found it has a real sense of adventure and immersion. A lot of modern convenience (ie: fast travel) is gone, so you’re forced to walk and explore a lot more. Plus the GW2 map is very compartmentalized, so you kind of just hit one section at a time, then move on to the next. With WoW Classic it feels more open and connected, and the player feels a lot smaller in comparison. Really a perspective shift, honestly, and I have been enjoying it.
---
So, even badly designed content is enjoyable ifor a brand new player? Ok. Which means that it is acceptable to make mediocre content if your business strategy is not to maintan healthy population, but to rotate people regularly, neglecting established  players, but alluring new ones?
---
Pretty scummy for a mmo, but I guess thats a plan that works for b2p "horizontal progression" thing.
---
I wouldn't be so sure about that percentage. But that doesn't change that bringing back its content would be great either way, like I agreed.
---
Because of this forcing and so much competition that players in those games get toxic. Nah, I'm perfectly fine with gw2 being different. We have enough of those in the style you mentioned. Yay for diversity.
---
You can swap proffesions any time you want for 50 silver and keep your progress, so don't worry.

It is not hard to get into raiding, it is time consuming and difficult to find 9 other people with the right classes at a similar skill level. Strikes will not help anything.
---
&gt; Breakbar, add it!
---
How big should the breakbar be? How much cc should be needed to dismount a player?
---
p.s. As an added bonus GW2 is an excellent walking simulator. It's why I still level my toons by hand instead of using Tomes.
---
That doesn't sound weird at all
---
I had a similar experience with introducing a friend recently, seeing her fresh enthusiasm at simple things like how dramatic staff skill 5 is on fire attunement ele. We'd pass other people and all I could think were things like how overused certain items were, how fed up I was of seeing certain backpieces, and she was just happy to see other people, glowy overused fashion meta or not.
---
Really made me realise how jaded I've gotten, so I'm trying to get back to roots, playing without levelling tomes, more open to exploration and not just map completion (I've found a few weird little details and easter eggs I've never seen before) and such. It's definitely worth taking a step back once in a while, maybe trying out some new things. It's unlikely any of can ever go back to this 'honeymoon phase' as so many people here are calling it, but we can get close. We can remember what made us fall in love with the game in the first place, and this game is large enough that there will always be something 'new' to us, even if it was there from the start and we just never saw it. 
---
And sometimes, there's no point in forcing compassion and you need to take a step back to the point of maybe sampling other MMOs in the field. Personally, getting into FFXIV made me miss GW2 that much more, and it's not the first time I've been on that back-and-forth between GW2 and every other MMO out there.
---
Either way it's certainly an 'us, not them' type problem. I worry a lot of people get bitter and don't care to think to amend their feelings on the game. It's so easy to focus on the negatives, to only see the bad in every patch, and while I do advocate being realistic for how you look at gaming experiences (I've seen way too many people covering for bad games) there's such a prevailing negative attitude within the MMO community as a whole that can't be hard to overcome, and it's definitely here. You only have to look at the downvote/upvote ratio on OP's post to see that. 17% downvoted (at time of my posting) for something relevant to GW2 discussion is ridiculous.
---
It isnt "so easy" but its easier on a flat map like queensdale.
---
[hmm...]( http://puu.sh/Eh8Yj/286c6f03c3.png)

Has anyone actually said the griffon can't fly?

My thing is, it looks too fast/difficult to control for me.
---
Glyph of Bounty makes a pretty big difference. I'm not sure I'm ready to fork out 400 gold for one. It is good to know that my experience with Timberline Falls was RNG. I'll give it another try. I did get some luck myself netting 10 of them from various maps, including 1 in LA. The jumping puzzle has two Herb nodes. It was one peppercorn out of 8 attempts, but I got one. The nodes reset pretty quickly, something like every 20 minutes.
---
Also, yeah, I've gotten nothing from WvW nodes.
---

---

---
just rotate them enough 90 degrees to get the arthur fist
---
It is not that raids are hard at all, it is the time commitment, finding other people, and sacrifice of build freedom. That guy that enjoys DH longbow, core necro, longbow ranger, p/p thief, hammer rev... all of them are excluded from ever being a part of raids. Not to mention, some fights are exclusively condi-based and I have zero fun with condi builds. (I have full leggy armor and I don't know how I managed to slog through).
---
Great video, only criticism is you spend too much time in going around in the same place i.e that bridge.
---
just use itemcode with autohotkey script lul
---
Ok. The fun part about epidemic bouncing is having to perform a normal rotation (although an easy one for condi scourge) as well as coordinate properly with your teammates to get huge bounces that speed up the run overall. It also leaves a huge margin for error for the group, since scourge is such a naturally resilient class.
---
One could definitely argue that epidemic bouncing requires more coordination overall than normal pug strats, since most pugs just perform their rotation and never have to line up skills with each other or do anything special that involves other players besides boons. This applies to both raids and fractals imo
---
You are completely missing the point of what I just wrote.  
---
Guild services are only really used for Guild Hall stuff, PvP guild teams, PvE world bosses, lots of WvW stuff, and guild missions. 
---
For everything else we don't really need all the things guilds offer.  
---
Strip out all the bells and whistles from guilds that we don't need for something like a guild for raids or fractals, and you are left just with a list of people with a few permission settings, a Message of the Day, and a chat tab, which take way less resources to keep. No guild vault, no guild inventory, no guild hall, no decorations...
---
So that's what we really need. Not a few more guild slots that can't be added because they'll take too many resources, but *unlimited* Community group slots that would take very few resources in comparion.  
---
If we had community groups slots we wouldn't even need more than 3 guild slots, one for PvE, one for PvP and one for WvW and alliances. Everything else could go in Community groups.

I have 24k hours in the game over 2 accounts.  My secret? I like to teach people. I love meeting newbies and teaching them, taking them through earning achievements. Showing them JPs or dungeons, fractals and raids. Like you just experienced - their sense of awh - seeing them achieve it. Helping them.. it makes me feel good many of them surpass me in game skill (sure i do all endgame content but i am no pro) and then i move on to the next batch of newbies.

The way I was interpreting it was that the 10 man version will be instanced and otherwise it'll be like an open-world meta replacement to some extent (or the meta itself, anyway).  I'm getting really sick and tired of shitty, pessimistic sarcasm before we've even single implementation.
---
The guy isn't wrong. Sure, the principle of flight vs glide is sketchy, but what he's saying isn't fundamentally incorrect: Queensdale is a fairly flat map which makes ascent and diving fairly easy to control if you're well practised. What's impressive in the video is the camera control more than anything else, alongside fairly precise adjustments that any newer players or less skilled in griffon flight probably wouldn't manage to replicate - but they're still not fundamentally difficult tricks if you practise.
---
And you don't need to upload a video to prove that point, either. Stop being so petulant and childish. The camera control is the most impressive aspect of this video, and Queensdale being a flat map doesn't take away from the fact the guy's clearly skilled at using his griffon to be able to move his camera in such a way without bonking into anything. ***But that also doesn't change the fact*** that Queensdale is a flat map which makes this kind of gliding arguably easy to do as long as you practise it. If you don't believe me, instead of demanding I go watch upload a video, just go practise it yourself for a little bit. It *really* isn't that challenging.
---
"Things that we wouldn’t rule out – but that we’re not talking about today – would be like another mount, another elite specialisation, those types of things. Those are all things that traditionally have waited until a boxed product is ready. But instead, now we’re saying, ‘look, here are the things that we’re doing. Here’s what we’re releasing right now. Here’s what’s next.’ Some of that was given in the roadmap from February. We’re getting pretty close to being done with all the things I said we were going to do, and now going into the territory of the things that I said were on the horizon."
---
So just like we expected, there's some chance we'll get elite specs during this season. A chance.
---
Good enough for me.
---
Exordium means first, or start etc.  Some have speculated we are getting another gs and then an omega gs like eternity.

---
I hope they can prove us wrong then. I'd love to be completely blasted with content beyond an hour long story.
---
Right right
---
I have never heard a single person say that the griffon can't fly. Actually, when compared to the Skyscale, griffon flat out flies longer distances if both mounts start at the same point and fly straight, and it can fly considerably faster *and* longer distance if starting from a hill/cliff/rooftop.
---
Not that it takes away from the impressive camera control here; it takes some good practise to be able to pull off the tighter turns you do in this video while moving the camera so freely. But let's also be fair here: it's the same camera movements that make what you're doing seem more impressive than it actually is. Flying through the Queensdale bridge on-loop isn't really groundbreaking, nor is flying through the entirety of the map in a single span with good use of dive and ascent - what makes it look so good here is the amount of time you've practised doing so while making the camera cinematic. 
---
Overall, it's a good video. The camera tricks sell it as very impressive and I think you could make a pretty genuinely entertaining series with this style of video if you chose slightly more complex maps (which, in fairness, is hard to do in Core Tyria, they're all kind of flat.) Great choice of music, too.
---
Yes, if they are actually incorrect they will get removed.
---
The solution is to always be speedy yourself (at least if you are used to jump with that speed). Noone will randomly change your jump distance.
---
There are multitude ways of going about this, like rewarding raiders more if you are helping someone kill their first raid, some sort of tutor system where if you form a squad and got 5+ newbie raiders, everyone get more rewards. Promoting guilds to form some sort of partnership with anet where they get some perks for maintaining trainings, kinda like how RiT does now, but out of their own good will alone. Like imagine if they had more incentive to train people if they were partnered with anet, and more incentives for all trainers of all timezones to join.
---
&gt; excels mostly as "precisely controlled ascent/descent".
---
Lol nope, it's actually one of the worst for descending and has limited windows where it bests the others in ascending. Not sure which one is faster between regular falling and the griffon dive but both gliding and the jackal are way more precise. On the flip side the skyscale's "ground suction" effect makes it incredibly annoying when you *don't* want to fully touch down.
---
For vertical ascents the springer is faster and easier to control as long as it can make the jump, no hassle of accidentally getting stuck on the cliff either. For short bouts like the Kourna herb farm the griffon is better because again it dives for a faster touchdown.
---
Basically the skyscale can gain more height than the springer especially with the cliff jump, and you can use the double barrel roll in place of a raptor leap where you need the extra altitude. Also the engage is a fire field and deals the largest total amount of damage IIRC.
---
&gt; once you know a few tricks to get around in it
---
That's true for *all* jumping puzzles. Doesn't help with the initial learning curve and is kind of a snobby thing to say to those who are still struggling with it. 
---

It's not meaningless at all , the PoF rewards are not too exciting for the most part indeed.
---

---
I simply disagree. "Let's see you doing it if it's so easy" is *exactly* the right reaction to someone being dismissive towards someone elses achievement. Nothing childish about putting someone down who's just running his mouth. Being technically correct doesn't change him being a bit of a bugger.
---
I am concerned about not whether there will be elites but whether they will be released all at once.
---
If they are released one by one, obviously 8/9ths of the population are going to be annoyed their main was not also given something new. Similarly if they release 3 at a time.
---
But 9 elite specs seem like a LOT of content to release in one Living World episode / saga segment. Won't they also need to retroactively add hero points to old current season/saga maps to allow players to unlock stuff?
---
I could see it being something they release at the end of the saga, when part of the update is new hero points across all the current season maps! That would also give people something to explore and master while waiting for the next saga/season.
---
It is worth it if you plan on playing the game yes .
---
For a fresh 80 , everything is relevant .
---
Do a barrel roll!
---
No, it is badly designed content. How can I "optimize" fun out of it before I even see it? Does "fun" equal to being dumb, lacking very basic knowledge about the game, horribly underperforming? 
---
Exploring and optimizing encounters is fun, even playing them in optimized way and pushing them further is fun. Things like snowman's something or dragonbash arena have none of that. I don't expect strike missions to have it either, their purpose is solely to give a sense  of accomplishment to most inept players out there.
---
That takes me back to the days of the GW1 meme templates.
---
Man that's wild that some folks think the griffon can't fly.
---
I do agree that being able to circuit the bridge without pulling up takes more practise than just flying through it the once, but I'd also be honest and say it was probably the least impressive part of the video. By comparison though, flying under the bridge at 1:17, pulling up and then diving into a spiral by using your camera was downright magical to watch, even though technically there's no "trick" involved in that. The video is easily at it's best when you make use of your camera to alter the flight, alongside some of the trickier barnstorming.
---
The griffon has always been my favourite mount and I don't even want to think about how many hours I spent on the Expert and Master courses - and how regularly I go back to them just for the sheer enjoyment of flying the griffon. I never personally considered using the camera to the degree you do to alter my flight, and that might be something I play with in free time because it's downright impressive to watch (and, knowing me, I'm going to crash my ass into a lot of things while practising) so I definitely don't want to sound like I'm downplaying the skill in the video on display or saying the griffon is an easy mount.
---
Just, I think the best skill you show in the video is the creative camerawork, and I would 100% watch future videos with similar flights where you use the camera in that way. Because despite what some people seem to think (based on the downvoting happening on the first comment I made) I think that the camerawork on display here is as close as you get to artistry with mounts in GW2, and I will wholly praise that.
---
They aren't dumbing down the content , it's not like Strikes will be replacing raids or anything .
---
i know many ppl that dont like the story at all so rushing throw the story is total normal for them, but the story in total is also not long in the LW Story updates and after that u maby to map come und then u leaf most maps.
---
&gt; said 
---
They sure did.
---
They ban for just about anything they can justify.
---
I had no strikes against me but 2 years ago was banned because I suggested the reason WvW never got updates was because it 's broken state encourages mass transfers thus earning them $$$.

They perma banned me within minutes and said it was for "Spreading conspiracy theories"

---
The linked thing is from a warning, not a ban
---
The ban is more likely related to other incidents consistent with this type of behavior
---
Neither am I. I said **if** they do it *right*. They have done a lot right, they have also dropped the ball plenty, they seem to really want to push raids which regardless is a good thing. Hopefully they do it right so I dont need to take 5+ newbies into Cairn and slam our face against it for 2 hours just for a kill. Half the time shit is happening so fast and shit is punishing enough for a newbie 
---
It takes 5-10 pulls to just start seeing *what* to do exactly. Some people learn plenty from explanations, others learn from videos, and others (like me) learn from doing and screwing it up. Give me W8 in a slimmed down version that slowly stacks on mechanics any day vs an explanation or a video and I'll be happy as shit to try it for real.
---
Is this a bug?
---
Dropping the MH mace for another axe would be a start. Keep bow OH if you rally want the range or  swap mace/mace or mace/shield for a CC set.
---
As a healskill I like blood reckoning (which is also what you will find in meta builds) due to its aggressive potential as well as large heal if you manage to do a lot of damage, but it's very possible to change depending on circumstance. The other classic choices are heal signet for passive heal or "to the limit" for a huge heal and full adrenalin.
---
As an elite skill it's hard to beat Headbutt, as it provides full adrenalin to open berserk, descend CC on a low cooldown and the other warrior elites are a bit meh.
---
The three utility skills are a bit more situational. If you want the raw dps take signets or banners depending on being in a solo or group setup. The rage skills berzerker brings to the table will allow you to stay in berzerk longer, which is good so these are always a solid choice. Consider the stunbreak to counteract the selfstun on Headbutt. If you run peak performance you want to bring a physical skill such as kick along. But with these you can really swap and choose depending on the situation (e.g. du you need stability or iframes for a mini dungeon etc.
---
The next big thing would be traits and gear. But before going into that in detail: what are you running atm?
---
Oh the frustrated vets absolutely have reasons to be frustrated, don't get me wrong, it's just that their reasons for frustration aren't really relevant to new or returning players who haven't gotten tired of the existing content yet. That's why I'm saying the new and returning players should ignore it, rather than getting discouraged by things that don't really affect them.
---
Disagree. With a bit of practise it's fairly easy to get the griffon to maintain a fairly decent height by diving and ascending as long as you can keep your speed and don't hit things. You're just making extreme generalisations to try and defend your point, when the reality is that if "any halfwit" bothered to practise for even half an hour and had all the masteries needed, they'd actually be pretty decent.
---
If you can do the Expert and Master griffon courses in gold, then you can do this kind of flying. What sets the OP apart is the camera controls here, and *that* is what makes this impressive.
---
I mostly use S tbh i ll try the other one i guess. Thanks mate .
---
Appeal because you believe you were wrongfully banned?  
---
or  
---
Appeal because you believe you have learned your lesson?
---
looking at your post history though; I doubt it.
---
I think we've been civilly disagressing since the start. It's always nice that this can happen once every blue moon. ;)
---
As far as I can see, we got two main differences in our opinion. For one, the griffon flying was indeed impressive. Not only is elegance and grace an acquired skill, a lot of times he also threads the needle, which I indeed could not. And I got gold on all Griffon tracks. I even go as far as claming that the vast majority would not be capable of doing what OP has done. *Without* the style bonus!
---
The second biggest point of disagreement is not pushing back against dismissive behaviour. Experiencing pushback is vital. "Well let's see you doing it better" is a valid way. Sure, it's not some high concept comeback, but it easily shows that the dismissed achievement is appreciated by others and that it's obviously not so dismissable (is that an actual english word?) if one can't just simply reproduce it.
---
"we're not done" huh? If you spent all this money but still won't give players a roadmap, which they've been asking for since release, and which would cost nothing, what gives? Players think you're done. The reddit is bombarded daily by "dead game". TELL US WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. STOP WASTING MONEY ON BIG, INFOLESS HYPE.

---
You really need to work on your sentence structures
---
yeah it sounds more like well but there´s a lot of countent u just nead a break think
---
The first is definitely a difference in opinion, albeit a somewhat subjective one. I do sincerely think that if you (the general person, not specifically you) can do the griffon expert and master courses in the game, and especially do them within the gold time limit the game has (*without* pre-flying through the start) then you can 100% fly like this. It might take a little bit more practise to be able to do it flawlessly in a single flight, but I genuinely don't believe that it's as difficult as everybody makes it out to be which also means I don't feel it's that impressive. What sets this video apart from the *many* others I've seen (as this isn't the first nor will it be the last of "flying very fast through maps barnstorming") is the camerawork. Now *that* aspect of the video I would never downplay. If I tried to spiral dive by using my camera, I would crash face-first several times. But in terms of actual barnstorming, especially on a flatter map like Queensdale, the flight in and of itself isn't what I find to be difficult.

To the second, it will remain a disagreement between us, I think. I have always, and will continue to always find, the "I'd like to see you do it" excuse to be childish and dismissive of genuine criticisms in almost every case I see it used. Much like in the examples I stated originally, it's often used when somebody critiques some form of art or media - "I'd like to see *you* make a movie/art/story/song" as if that justifies literally anything. The reality of criticism - even if you disagree with the criticism being levied - is that somebody doesn't *have* to have done something to be able to criticise it. Furthermore, if the problem with the criticism is that it's wrong (assuming this isn't subjective criticism we're talking about) or that it's given in a wrong attitude, being equally childish doesn't really help make your case. I don't think the dude was told "Looking forward to seeing your video" and thought "Oh, shit, people actually really value this and I guess my word means nothing if I can't do it too". If he's an asshole, then he's just going to call you childish regardless of what you say. If his criticism *wasn't* even necessarily wrong, but his tone/delivery wasn't pleasant or what you deem to be fair, then still hitting back with the "let's see you do better" doesn't change his mind, either, because it's still a childish response overall.

I play mainly PvE and a bit of WvW.
---
But I also want to try out raids.
---
What should be my first steps and where do I start?
---
Some are actually difficult to do for some of us
---
[https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Pain](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Pain)

Yep! You're probably noticing your gear has a colored border - green, blue, maybe even yellow. These colors indicate the rarity - common, uncommon, and rare, respectively. Each rarity has slightly better stats than the one below it. Once you start getting close to max level, you can occasionally find orange - exotic - gear you can equip. You can also find exotic gear relatively cheap on the trading post. It's good enough for raiding and most other things at max level.
---
But there are two tiers higher than exotic, even!
---
Ascended gear has a magenta border, and has slightly higher stats than exotic. It typically requires a decent amount of effort to get. Some achievements offer ascended gear as rewards. Other ascended items are crafted, from materials on a daily cooldown. The only things that really *require* ascended gear are higher-level fractals - scalable dungeons - because ascended and legendary armor provides resistance to damage dealt in these fractals. Personally I've never bothered, but a lot of people love fractals.
---
Legendary gear has equal stats to ascended. It makes up for the lack of more stat increases by being able to change its stats on the fly. So if you wanted to go from a condition-based build to a power-based build, rather than having to find a whole new weapon you could just click a button and reconfigure your legendary from condition to power. They typically are quite expensive and/or time consuming to acquire, but they're [really, really pretty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Bifrost).
---
Exactly, and we can't forget the foods and stat infusions as well, that's another big chunk, and let's not even talk about boons. What's our open world ele going to have, maybe a couple stacks of might if they're lucky? The occasional fury? Practicing on the golem with no food, no boons, and no conditions on the golem except what you bring yourself is a MASSIVE difference from using the standard set of boons and conditions SC use for benchmarks.
---
Skyscale Is better for farming and map exploration .

Ohhhhh thank you so much for the info,

And yea they really do look pretty!

dont forget about all the salt, when one platform failed :x
---
Yes, that is because people have stuff to do in other mmos and dont stand bored in starter areas, gw2 is different, there is nothing meaningful to do, so helping is kinda meaningful, gw2 creaters need to work on this, cause when you see many high level players in starting zone jerking off to others enjoyment, than you know something is wrong

---
Awesome work =)
---
Unless you a fudge boy like me an find those spots in the invisible walls that give you higher endurance regen mid-flight and let you gain slight height every flap (RIP boundaries in any map)
---
Bingo.  This is a huge problem with almost any modern game and the modern mindset of gamers.  However, GW2 is not free of fault in this regard.  The game has to be able to provide a setting for you to take things slow and get immersed.
---
GW2's gameplay doesn't really get interesting until you hit max level, and personal story is pretty sub par.
---
Hearts are highly localized versions of "quests" that rarely broaden or expand the world, and there are no quests in this game that span the world.  Unless you account the extremely nebulously detailed "achievements" based progression for some legendaries and collections.
---
GW2 does a fucking terrible job of making its world immersive.  And it STRONGLY conditions you to min-max income gain because most damn everything is a grind.  Grabbing resources.  Getting gold.  Gem exchanges.  Legendaries more or less being how much money you can afford to blow.  
---
You mention the griffon.  How in the hell is a 250 gold, goldsink any way going to be immersive?  It's not.  It's literally a goldsink and little more.  Considering income is extremely slow unless you are *literally grinding and metagaming* there's really not much that GW2 does to make their world a world.
---
The problem is most games have failings that also enforce min-max optimal gameplay at the cost of their world and setting.  It's all based on skinner box shit, and with most modern games reinforcing gambling (GW2's black lion chests are no different), it only makes them less incentivized to produce good, long lasting content that expands the world, not just the "federal fucking issue" of the day.
---
I think games need to be approached differently to be enjoyed.  Having approached GW2 from the slow, taking time to be 'immersed' camp, it's just not that enjoyable that way.  It's much more fun to just treat it as an amusement park game where you can go on some beautiful rides along the way, with more rides being added in over time.  
---
But it's an expensive amusement park and all the rewards are locked behind spending far too much money on the minigames, or needing to pay a huge amount of actual money for them.  That's not to say you can't play it immersively but 90% of the time it's really not worth it.
---
Wow. I don't even know what OP expected.
---
You can gain unlimited height. Takes some masteries but it can be done. Broken out of many maps this way. :p
---
They tried deathmatch once. Matches were invariably one team spawncamping the other, so they never tried it again.

*Throws Skyscale out of the window.*
---
Yeah, I thought it was great until I see what the builds are for. :)
---
&gt; The highest amount you can provide is 23 with that and only for a very limited amount of time.  
---
No, the highest amount you can provide is 25 with that [rune](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Pack) for 16 secs with 100% bd (and don't forget FURY).
---
&gt;  Are you sure about the 500dps and why is it quickness dependant if auto attack and skill both scale the same with quickness. 
---
Yes, I am one billion percent positive, it is very easy to test out, go to golem and have 4 tests :
---
1. Have all major buffs WITH quickness and do your normal rotation WITH sword#4 in it.
---
2. Have all major buffs WITH quickness and do your normal rotation WITHOUT sword#4 in it.
---
3. Have all major buffs WITHOUT quickness and do your normal rotation WITH sword#4 in it.
---
4. Have all major buffs WITHOUT quickness and do your normal rotation WITHOUT sword#4 in it.
---
After you done with the test, compare test#1 vs test#2, and test#3 vs test#4. Do more than once for each test if you want a consistent dps. 
---
Also here is the [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ahcoqh/updated_builds_and_benchmarks_for_diviner/eeej2rp/?context=3) that discussed about this, they have very good infors.
---
&gt;  Phases in fractals are a lot shorter and breakbar exists, that  amplifies all your dmg by 65% (with impact). Using sword 4 + 5 into that  is quite a lot of burst compared to autoattack.  
---
I neither disagree or agree your point with this and with the sigil of impact logic, I have not test the two sigils in fractal due to the inconsistent in rotation and dps, your dps could be higher if your party's cc is good, and lower if cc is bad, and since you and the warr(proba) are most likely the only one to cc, that's why I suggest to use axe so you and your party will have less worry about cc( this point is aim toward pug, if you have a static, sword offhand is what you should use). However I do agree that impact is better for non-boss fractals, but the thing is that trash mobs die fast to your team's dps, so your little 3% dmg won't matter much to them.
---
&gt;  Also you only cap critchance with full endurance so i would never swap berserker pieces for valk. 
---
You do realize that rene have this [trait](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Brutal_Momentum) right? It is basically a prema vigor with high bd, plus you don't dodge much beside the fatal mechs in fractal anyway, rene has sword#3 as a dodge if you can time it well( also a dps increase if you take that dodge into account for overall dps). Dwarf also have hammers to heal you along with Kalla's elite, you are pretty much can't die if you play well.
---
I usually use the bow when I don't want to close on whatever I'm fighting.
---
Aw yeah! Aurene's house. She got a nice piece of land too.
---
Where did you see these reports? I’ve never heard of band for running on Linux (not to say there haven’t been, I’ve just never come across that).
---
Aurene's prettying up the place I see!
---
In theory this it how it works. If there would be much more and easier teamcontent (as like 10 new dungeons each year).
---
Because not every casual (or even coregamer) would turn into a hardcore raider who farms raids weekly. Similar as not everyone farmed all dungeons on a daily basis. If you do each raid ~ twice a year: that's probably not often enough to become good.
---
Average joe repeats content only a couple of times. Not often enough to become a competent raid player. Training in easier content (as dungeons, fractals etc.) is lacking because there is not enough easier teamcontent. Especially when players are not farming fractals daily - but only, as more casual players usually do, repeat them a couple of times.
---
That's not all that's thickening
---
That's interesting, since according to the Apr 02 Roadmap from Mike Z: 
---
[https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
**The Programming team is focused on WvW Alliances.**
---
The prioritization of the WvW community, there's something familiar about it that I just can't bring to mind ;).
---
Also, according to Raymond L, they were already testing the backend systems, finding bugs and working on solidifying that by Nov 29, 2018.
---
While you are right in essence, elite specs also adds a complication that requires upkeep.
---
The competetive modes have been at the worst balance for the past 2 years looking at the entire 7-year span. Not only has it been bad but it has also been stale and left unadressed. More elite specs requires both more work to balance and more upkeep to keep balanced.
---
Now, I'm not trying to be too facetious here but ArenaNet are seemingly overstaffed on artists and content writers while severely understaffed on game designers. That is why the game designers pop up on every other project, why their team(s) are stretched over multiple modes and why we have sagas rather than gameplay additions or why gameplay changes take so much time to implement whereas heavy content is churned out relatively quick. In part that is likely due to ArenaNet's priorities but in part it is also likely a result of HR-practises, the hiring market and legal praxis. The gaming industry is an industry with alot of short term work and employment but it is still difficult to navigate the ever changing needs of ongoing development.
---
Basically look at tooltips, to read more use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options, and then there's wp's older video about that stuff
---
Very, very nice! And especially good that you used the Most Proper Gryphon Model (IMO anyway).
---
&gt;It'd be nice to see some progress on undoing a lot of the dragon corruption instead of particular zones being frozen in time.
---
Too much game content revolves around the old maps' level of corruption. At best, we'll see some "uncorruption" occur in the midst, but it'd be pure aesthetic like the statue of Trahearne in the Grove. If they went and removed the Dragonbrand and Branded from Blazeridge Steppes, let alone Thunderhead Peaks or Jahai Bluffs, those maps would be more barren of events and content than Domain of Kourna.
---
I am pretty sure some people in my groups are doing the ironman challenge against bosses. Would explain the dps

---
Like Assassins and Dervishes, Paragons were "physical magic users" in GW1. Their magic became part of what is now Guardians (merged with Monks and Ritualists).
---
&gt;Everyone in Tyria uses magic. It's such an inherent part of the world that anyone has it. Even the Charr use it despire being distrustful of it.
---
Correction: Everyone **can** use magic (nowadays), but that doesn't mean they *do*.
---
Warriors and Engineers are both professions (discounting the Spellbreaker elite specialization, that is) which are intentionally vague and ambiguous as to whether their feats are them "using magic", "using magic devices", or "mundane but super awesome." To some degree, ArenaNet wanted to leave it up to the individual players to decide.
---
[Mirror](https://streamable.com/h724x)
---
Warriors (sans Spellbreaker) were designed to be "up to interpretation" for whether - and how - they use magic. Scott McGough confirmed this on the forums a few years back, as quoted and linked by another in this comment thread to someone other than you.
---
Correction: the article was saying that everyone **can** use magic, not that they *do*. Distinct difference.
---
Spellbreakers are magic, but Berserkers not so much. The reveal post for Berserker actually states that they don't use magic with their torch skills, at least, as counter to guardians' use of torches.

Nice to see a different setting for the new map. Also the resultion is higher this time. Hopefully we get to 1080p on Tuesday.

Need some advice please; I'm planning to make a full set of Zojja gear for my reaper, I have enough mats to make 3 pieces at once, though I'm limited by the lack of recipes as well as laurels. Would it be wise to craft whatever ascended and convert it to Zojja instead of saving up laurels for the recipes? 
---
Thank you!
---
Right now it's single elimination. If you lose a round, that's it. You're out.
---
Swiss tournaments instead have you play multiple matches and get points for winning, and the team with the most points overall wins.
---
It is *not* round robin as you are not guaranteed to fight every other team. Additionally, each round tries to pair your team off with a team that has a similar win/loss record.
---
See, the issue here is you assumed there's anybody leading, but if you ever played on Gandara you'd know it feels like nobody is leading.
---
Done most of those things, unfortunatly. I say unfortunatly, because only after i invested time and money i found out, that what i got, is some gear which was close to the basic gear you get cheap at stores after you hit 80, then i found out, the STRONGEST GEAR IN GAME is a bit stronger than exotic which you get very very easy, so basically after you get a set of exotic, which you just buy from the store, you are close to max strength, game over, you did it !, wvw is so bad, its more than sad, a special map for pvp, wtf, the fights you find not very often but when they happen there are 2-3 zergs and so much lag, you just have to look at pictures, spells you hit 30 seconds ago, pop off, everything about pvp in gw2 is extremely bad, its  basically a how to not to do it for other mmos... skills and mechanics are... meh, they look nice at some characters but thats it. Only thing gw2 did right imo is the quests on each map are nice and the mounts are superior to other mmos. Thats it, imagine playing the game cause... mounts.. thats it, quests loose there meaning anyway after max level, since the strongest gear is close to basic gear its not like you can get anything that will make yourself see progress, just ilussions, like gold, whih also is useless once you have a set which you like how it looks and if its exotic, no more need for gold, gear, pvp sucks badly, so what you gonna do, go to starter zones help beginners, which makes you believe you have stuff to do.... like now honest everything you said there is useless boring activitys
---
Thank you.
---
Imagine being a casual guy, who hasn't played MMOs before. You pick up this game because one of your friends said it was worth a try. You feel a bit shy so you decide to start your journey off as a human. You go through the tutorial getting a feel for the game, pretty unusual but fine. As the cutscene after that rolls you can't wait to go and explore the world.
---
As the cutscene ends the first thing you see is this guy doing tricks on his griffon going 400km/h. At that moment you most likely shat your pants.
---
GW2 is a horrible mmo and would be a much better game if it just got rid of the shackles of pretending to be one. You're more or less hitting a major reason of why I think it is. There's no real incentive to group or build community or make friends, which really kills the community aspect and the entire reason for actually being an MMO.

If you thought that was funny then you have a pretty warped sense of humor.
---
I've been playing it a bit.
---
The honest answer is not much. It's a dated game with dated systems. The raid scene will be dead pretty quick, so the people who left for that confuse me. (The game will only ever have 7 raids, several of then single boss encounters, and the best meta strategy is already known before they come out)
---
That said it is fun to go revisit a game from my youth without all of the crazy streamlining that retail WoW took too far. I don't sub consistently but I'll probably pop in for a month every other update.

You've done more than me in that side of the game, and I'm a veteran. So, that's pretty awesome. How'd you end up getting yourself into the raid scene, as a new player? what was that experience like?
---
&gt; Flying through the Queensdale bridge on-loop isn't really groundbreaking...
---
But it is fucking cool and something the vast majority of players in the game (myself included) currently cant couldnt do to save thier lives. It may not be ground breaking but this is definitely a display of skill.
---
Torch 4 is actually what I was referring to with the article.
---
&gt; While the guardian uses magical flames for protection and purging, berserkers use the torch as a reckless weapon of destruction, slamming it into the ground and even lighting themselves ablaze to become mobile fire fields.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/meet-the-berserker-warriors-elite-specialization/
---
Counter to using it as magic like Guardians, Berserkers do not.
---
So you and everyone around you get annoyed by the animation everytime you see your computer screen with the corner of your eye
---
I saw wooden potatoes is doing a series on YouTube for the best builds on each class for open world PvE and story. That would probably be good for you to check out.
---
Find a guild that does training runs - it's much, much better than doing it with a pickup group. 
---
/r/guildrecruitment is pretty decent. Also, get a raid-worthy build following either Snowcrows or Metabattle advice.
---
No need to be condescending. Judging by the devs' comments in that article wooden potatoes covered (and that was posted on this sub), they arent planning to release elite specs any time soon. Even if they end up releasing some with ice brood saga, that should be in a few months. So maybe a year and a half instead of 3. By your math, 4 * 8 from earlier, we get 32 months between spec releases if they do it little by little. That is a little over 2 and a half years between spec releases.
---
My point remains. A little trickled out over a period, or the bulk launched after roughly the same period. I'd rather some than none.
---
So this is the reason why Gandara only clouds every fight?
---
Isn't that the point
---
&gt; Buildcraft is only limited in sense that defined roles have higher impact than hybrid builds.
---
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that there's way less room to make use of different game mechanics like stun breaks and condi cleanse in raids than there is in Fractals/Open World/Competitive modes. In raids, the only thing people care about is damage, which gives raiders ridiculously narrow-minded opinions on the various classes/elite specs in this game. People think Berserker is so good because it does good damage when in reality it is extremely flawed. Just take it into any competitive situation and you'll see that. Same goes for things like Holosmith. Holosmith is broken as FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUCK, but people don't see that in raids because, despite all of the bloat associated with it, people just see it as a mediocre DPS class. All-in-all, the game is a lot smaller in scope in Raids than any other place in the game, and that makes it less interesting to me, which is why I stopped after my third or so boss kill with my guild. So many people in raids don't even know how to build because they copy builds from Snow Crows and deem everything else trash. They aren't familiar with such simple things like combo fields and finishers because they just aren't something that matters in raids. It doesn't help that literally every single build on Snow Crows is extremely boring. The meta builds in PvE are ALWAYS the dullest and boring ones. There's never a situation where using banners or never activating signet is fun because they aren't. The game is designed around the philosophy skills/traits that give the most DPS are also less interactive. 
---
You could show a raider a picture of [Spectrum Shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spectrum_Shield) or [Dolyak Stance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dolyak_Stance) and they'd probably go into a DPS-deprived coma or something. 
---
&gt; LFG has nothing to do with raiding, you can raid with people you met in any part of the game and invite whoever you want through LFG. Just because **there are** restrictions doesn't necessarily make it toxic, people just don't want to waste time on playing with inexperienced players.
---
What I'm saying is that the raid LFG is toxic... because it totally is. Many Fractal CM groups are toxic as hell, too. If "toxic" is not an accurate description of how the instanced PvE community is in GW2, then "passive-aggressive" is a better description. Everyone has huge egos and is very quick to judge people for tiny little errors and build options. It's very similar to what you see in many competitive games like mobas, but it makes no sense in the context of GW2 PvE because it isn't competitive. You're on the game team fighting AI enemies, yet people are still toxic. Being around these people in LFG makes me become more like that, and that's not something I want to become in GW2, so I avoid it. All of this applies to both raids and fractals, but the raiding community is much worse in my experience.
---
I prefer annoying people with my W7 CM chair, the fireworks never glitch for me but sometimes they do for other people
---
Eh to be honest I was kinda joking, I use my Skyscale to stand higher and enjoy scenery in the city. If I want to cover space I use Embiggening Tonic or the anniversary chair

You can definitely take inspiration from the builds there. As others already stated, if you want to run a power build, using double axe is recommended due to the damage modifiers they have and their overall great skills. As for range weapon, even though longbow is more leaning towards condi, its still good to use. Rifle would be the other option.
---
If you look at the power berserker build SC has on their site, you can somewhat use the traits they show of there with some small changes (for example you dont need "Doubled Standards" in discipline and can instead take "Brawlers Recovery" for easy condi cleanse) and adjust the utility skills a bit for your preferences.
---
Gear wise i recommend you check out this video [Best Builds for Standard Guild Wars 2 PvE - Gear &amp; Items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RImXHc2KLbE). It's part of an ongoing series that is dealing with open world builds and has some very good tips - the guy will eventually also make a warrior build so you may want to stay tuned for that.
---
Kind of funny to see how this topic gets down voted consider if you are in WvW then players who really do play WvW every day are pretty much all agreeing on that it should not be that a person have a free get out of jailcard anywere at any point in any situation. I don't think i ever seen anyone of the dedicated wvw players saying yes this is fair in any chat or voicetool inside of WvW. 
---
And yet here on reddit the topic get downvoted and anyone with a good idea too. It is very strange to me.
---
This thing is miles more fun to fly than anything in WoW or FFXIV
---
That one really made me wonder if people really figured it out after release or if it was leaked by insiders. I did it while watching a video and still failed many times.
---
there's a plug in somewhere that gives you a radial menu for mounts
---
I use Shift+ the lower row of letters after the left Shift key. Except for raptor, that goes in Shift+Q, where Q is the mount key. 
---
If they ever add more mounts, they better add an in-game mount wheel or fast mount key without having to use mods. 
---
For example, there could be a checkbox you can enable so the mount key will instead make the list of mounts appear under your mouse cursor, and clicking any of the entries in the list mounts that mount instead selecting it. 
---
Or letting us right click mounts in the list. Right click mount icon, it shows the list, right click rollerbeetle, mount rollebeetle.
---
I arrange them like: 
---
Z - Most used ground mount, my beetle.
---
X - Most used flying mount, my griffon. 
---
J - Raptor
---
K - Bunbun
---
L - Skimer 
---
; - Jackal 
---
I dont have the warclaw mapped since i dont play WvW, but when i went in for Gift of Battle, i just switched X for the warclaw. 
---
I also don't have a skyscale (nor do i care for it) but if i did i would put in in ; , instead of the jackal since it's my least used mount.
---
I dunno i been there for 6 years and i always knows who is leading were. In this case though noone really is because it is a drinking event going on and they are all having fun being silly :)
---
I do this too but also have my top two on the L and ; keys
---
Shift+ A-G (asdfg) for raptor, springer, skimmer, jackal, griffon
---
Shift + Z-C (zxc) for beetle, warclaw, skyscale. 
---
I have a 12 side button mouse but those keybinds were all spoken for a long, long, long time ago :)
---
I'm playing since launch, never have been banned.
---

Alt+number keys (which are bound to my razer naga). Quickly becomes muscle memory.
---
Thank you for the reply! :) Really appreciate it!
---
Jeez thats a lot of downvotes for a thread with so many positive comments
---
I have the profession skills (F1-F5) mapped to some of my extra mouse keys.  
---
Ctrl+F1 = Raptor, etc.  
---
Same for the newer mounts, just Ctrl+ other keys on my mouse.
---
Also have them mapped to NumPad 1-8 for alternative access.

yeah, thats pretty big BS mate.
---
Wow that is some amazing flying!
---
There are plenty of griffon races in season 4 maps and pof maps.
---
If it wasn't "haha it's joke wow don't take it so personally mods" and you're actually genuine that you learned you were being an ass about it instead of pretending, maybe.
---
Ah, so that uses season 4 masteries (stamina regen) to gain height, I guess I never considered that option as I only recently returned to the game :D
---
Ted wouldn't like that.
---
Based on reading your other comments, just go straight DPS power zerker. That **generalizes** down to full zerker gear, axe/axe. In open world specifically, if you must have range, then you're probably better off with Rifle in second slot rather than longbow. Otherwise your traits and utilities can stick to  [https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/)

- this game is beautiful! (๑♡⌓♡๑)

- has immersion breaking skins and colors

What are your three least used professions?  Imagine having to wait up to 8 months to get an elite spec for a profession you actually use.  Course, you never did go back and see how people felt, waiting to get the second legendary GS last.  You'd be fine with it.  How many people would be fine with having to wait to get their profession's elite spec.  Let's go way...way....way back to HoT.  oriignally, it took 400 hero points to get an elite spec.  Even waiting to get those 400 points was too much for people, and anet almost instantly reduced it to 250.  People couldn't wait a fuckin' month to get their new elite spec, and you think they'll wait 18-32 months?
---
So you want 1-1 the dragon banner defiance bar mechanic placed on the mount. How much cc is needed to break the bar on someone with a dragon banner anyways?
---
Warrior hasn't been released yet sadly
---
Well its a bit late atm but im free to help tomorrow just leave char name and time :).
---
Lmao didn't even notice that
---
Thank you; will do.

Generic Mount **(Skyscale): G**
---
**Raptor: Ctrl + G** (Ctrl for the speed boost)
---
**Springer: Shift + G** (Shift is up, bunny goes up)
---
**Beetle: Ctrl + Shift + G** (speed boost + sweet jumps)
---
**Skimmer: Alt + G** (hover/limited "flight")
---
**Griffon: Alt + Shift + G** (bigger flight, more up)
---
**Jackal: Ctrl + Alt + G** (speed boost + low teleport/"flight")
---
**Warclaw: G** in WvW, useless anywhere else.
---
Ehhh, it makes sense in my head, don't look at me like that...
---
residentsleeper
---
I probably have the most obscure mount binds and this post won't help you a single bit, but here, have a laugh. I have dodge and autorun as my side mouse buttons, let's say MB4 and MB5.
---
Shift+MB4 - Default mount (aka raptor in PvE, warclaw in Wvw)
---
Shift+MB5 - Jackal
---
Alt+MB5 - Skimmer
---
Ctrl+MB4 - Springer
---
Ctrl+MB5 - Gryphon
---
Ctrl+Shift+MB4 - Beetle
---
Ctrl+Shift+MB5 - Skyscale
---
This way I can mount any mount without moving my fingers away from usual keys.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If they are released one by one, obviously 8/9ths of the population are going to be annoyed their main was not also given something new. Similarly if they release 3 at a time.
---
I don't think they will be released in small batches, I don't think that would be a good idea. I'm positing that they might be released later into the season, but most likely all in a single release. 
---
&gt;But 9 elite specs seem like a LOT of content to release in one Living World episode / saga segment. Won't they also need to retroactively add hero points to old current season/saga maps to allow players to unlock stuff?
---
Ideally the hero points would already exist in the first episode maps, players would have a stockpile of them built up before the "elite episode" launches. Alternately, what they could do is have each episode team design heropoints for their maps, but not include them in the original launch, they would be turned off, but then the events of the "elite" episode would "activate" all these hero points scattered through the map. That would ensure that the workload is fairly distributed and the content is appropriately themed to the maps. 
---
And it's not like the people making elite specs would all be focused on that one episode, there would be the "episode team" who would be doing no more or less work than to produce an ordinary episode, and then there would be the "class balance" team, that would be building the elite specs. The release episode would just be the *place* where those changes get added. 
---
&gt;I could see it being something they release at the end of the saga, when part of the update is new hero points across all the current season maps! Along with doubling up activity on the new maps, that would also give people new gameplay mechanics to explore and master while waiting for the next saga/season.
---
Possibly, although the issues I'd see with that is that hopefully there would be an actual expansion coming after this saga, which would have its own elite specs, which would reduce the time these new ones would have to shine. Releasing them in the middle would give players more time to explore and enjoy these specs.

No Skyscale yet
---
Been looking for a hotkey mouse for a while though to escape these keybinds as it's chaos at times.
---
Data is in fact necessary for you to make the claim you are trying to make.
---
Doesn’t matter what kind of tournaments they have. Trash is trash. Dead game.
---
I would love to start this game but the only thing which I dont like is that there is no gear progression.
---
I watched some videos and everybody is telling me that there is no need to grind for better gear at a point.
---
Is this true?
---
Hey, name even checks out!
---
Yeah but most don't evn bother looking to join any group
---
Again it's a matter of taste. If you think everyone loved the fighting better in Guild Wars 2, you'd be wrong, because some people prefer the more twitchy active style, with active dodging. You prefer the combat in Guild Wars 1. I did not.  I did prefer the skill system in Guild Wars 1 however. 
---
I grew up on more arcade games and find this combat more natural for my play style.
---
Thank you; I will definately look at the build.
---
If I die in raids i'll die in real life
---
Yeah me too. I the rock concert is cool as hell, but it was basically the only thing they've been showing.
---
That being said, it is Anet after all. Remember the 2016 quarterly update that was MASSIVE yet had the most generic 20-second trailer of purely reused cutscenes?
---
The emote didn't show up because you didn't use correct capitalization. Maybe try it again.
---
vid made me tear..ur fluent with your griffin.
---
Yes. Ascended gear (BiS) is not particularly difficult to obtain, and exotic gear (around 5% worse) is even easier, many stat sets available on the trading post. 
---
Legendary gear is equivalent to ascended except that it can be stat swapped at will, a huge convenience feature. Legendary gear is quite a grind to get, so perhaps they will satisfy your desire.
---
Well I beat Turai Ossa with -2 fps
---
No they're scum

You can't post anything positive on this subreddit without 90% of the people here going apeshit. Nevertheless, welcome aboard!

Others have said it. Tailor, Weaponsmith.

Artificer can be useful. Chef can be useful, Huntsman can be useful.

Warriors and Paragons aren't magic users in GW1. They have attacks, shouts, adrenaline skills and signets which:
---
&gt;According to lore, signets are special tablets designed to hold a limited charge (essentially "magical batteries") for use by individuals otherwise unskilled in the use of magic.
---
[From here.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Signet#Trivia). It also notes that Elementalist, the class that has quite a bit of magic doesn't have any signets...because they have magic up the wahzoo.
---
GW2 maybe different, but got GW1 Warriors and Paragons were not supposed to be magic based.
---
Thank you (and all the other amazing people) for your work on the wiki! Glad you found someone so fast :)
---
Try and complete the game with the worst possible stat combo, the worst weapon type and the worst skills. Only exotics allowed. Do this for each class. Everything has to be the absolute worst possible selection.
---
The STD of crafting supplies, as we all know.
---
If anything his brand was worse in the far past.
---
If you play the arah explorable mode dungeon its said that the Forgotton tried to cleanse Kralk at one point but it didn't work so they tried it later on Glint.
---
This is what likely gave Kralk the duel nature that allowed him to love glint and feel bad about killing her.
---
He was still overcome with hunger like all dragons, still wanting to corrupt everything but at least felt bad about killing his greatest creation.
---
Yeah it sucks tbh. I prefer to just exploit since you can get to the max height of a map in a couple of seconds.
---
hahahaha i never paid attention to these,now  i cant stop laughing with all these icons.
---
If the thread for that trailer had been downvoted into oblivion and most comments that tried to discuss it instead of just shitting on it, you'd find that the trailer already began to introduce some of the structures that have lead up to this one.
---
The thing that's changed is that the game isn't new to us anymore so we need new content to enjoy to the same extent that your friend is, because yeah obviously your first experiences are going to be more exciting since it's fresh and new. Unfortunately the content releases of this game are very slow, so it's hard to not get bored and zombie-like while waiting. That's why right now my main focus is on another game.
---
Actually I'm waiting for the mini seasons.
---
Races != adventures.
---
It's up to you, it's not a terrible choice, but if you're still unsure you can check gw2efficiency for more accurate info to make a judgement on:

CTRL + what i use for my weapon and healing skills.
---
CTRL + 1 is the generic "mount up" key bind, which allows me to have it summon a useful mount in PvE, and the warclaw in wvw without switching anything around.
---
raptor has no use and thus doesn't even have a keybind anymore.
---
EZ.
---
Cant believe that actually worked lol. Thanks .
---
Those still look like ruins, so it may affect only some parts of Ascalon. Maybe it's some of Kralkatorrik's brand "healing" into an Aurene brand?
---
Very very good post. Agreed with absolutely everything you typed, especially as a veteran player of GW2 and as a newer FFXIV player that just now hit level 56 and is playing through heavensward content. I thought I was going to ragequit this game during early levels but post-ultima weapon FFXIV storywriting is so vastly superior to GW2's that it's just shocking. The combat is a lot more involved than I thought it was going to feel compared to early levels.
---
Man, SE really need to improve the new player experience don't they?
---
dudeeee i also have Logitech G602, but i bought a cheap and QUALITY mmo mice for the same reason, my mounts. believe me, cheap and quality exist. it has 12 side buttons.  redragon perdition 2 if you want to check. it has over 3000 review on amazon 4.1 stars. really good.
---
Berserkers are definitely magic. Most of their bursts are pyromancies, Blaze Breaker and Shattering Blow summon rocks out of the ground, and Wild Blow invokes the power of [Bear herself ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/90/Berserker_Utility_Wild_Blow.jpg).  
---
  
---
Initial concept art even shows that the Berserker was originally mend to invoke the spirits of the wild, use blood in their attacks, and summon spectral weapons. ([link 1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/18/Berserker_Concept_art_001.jpg) and [2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/4/46/Berserker_Concept_art_002.jpg))

A couple friends and I made free accounts some time back and opted to play by generating gold only by selling to NPCs and such. We could party together, but no trading between us or anyone else either. I think I got to about level 40 before we got distracted doing something else, but it was quite fun. We had talked about if we wanted anything off the gem store, earning the gold to convert to gems to get them. Even just the 2g dailies added up pretty well, and it's something I've considered going back to as well.
---
Actually they cleansed Glint first then tried to cleanse Kralk later on when we woke up.
---
This is falling with style.
---
The keyboard I have has 5 keys at the side that basically work as a shortcut to SHIFT+whatever key, so I use those keys for Raptor, Skyscale, Beetle, Jackal and Griffon.
---
For WvW, I have the Warclaw set to mount when I push in the scroll wheel on my mouse.
---
Finally, I just click the icon for Skimmer on the UI because I’m mad.
---
In case anyone asks about Springer, I’ve sort of stopped using it in favour of Skyscale.
---
There's a shrine to Grenth in lornars path I believe, that of you /kneel at it, you'll get a temporary buff - which was a call back to guild wars 1 where kneeling at the god statues would give you similar buffs, or even serve as entrances to endgame content. It still makes me happy going there for some slight nostalgia
