Then mb you can explain pls how to reach some events uder ground in Dragonfall, I'm runnig like idiot with raptor trying to find the way to jump while all ppl just flying there with griffon. It was about this.

It is very possible that this is a play style issue. I started with a warrior and got so bored that at level 30, I quit him, and the game, for a couple of years. When I came back, I grudgingly leveled him to 80 just to see the end game content. While researching gear, I happened upon a video of someone playing a daredevil thief and it looked super fun so I  bought the expansion, rolled a daredevil and never looked back. The whole game changed and nothing was boring again because I love to see him jump around vs. Warrior which was slow and clunky to me. I'd suggest trying out some other classes. You can go to the pvp lobby and try any class. You won't have to play a match, you can get out the class right there.

I need gold to get some skins to better look. It's a bit dissapointed, I moved from eso, because tired, and found gw2 pve more interesting BUT outfit and skin shit is so bad. I mean gw2 is so GREEDY about it. In eso when I was new player I got many free skins and outfits ffrom first week just doing quests. And their system is more friendly with gold too, like you ened just collect mats, all I see here is auction speculation which is worst tbh. Or lagging map converting staff many times and sell. Is it good?
---
I need a couple more red boxes and arrows in addition to the title of the post and the ones in the pic. Otherwise I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
You mean the announcement of another season of unengaging content, which is the reason those  people are frustrated with the game?
---

---
Don't be so obtuse.
---
For open world and story stuff I did Weaver S/D and just stayed in Earth-Fire the whole time. Between Lava Skin, Stone Resonance, and some synergistic Earth-Fire-Weaver traits you have insane survivability, to the point I was soloing group events while practically afk. And I have crap reaction speed. Wasn't as optimized for dps as other Weaver specs, but if you're looking to not die, it's the best I got.
---
I haven't tried Tempest, but I have heard it's better than Weaver at pretty much anything but straight-on dps, and it's a decent hand at that as well.
---
You could try running dungeons, theyre not like most MMOs you know, mostly story focused if that's your thing. Or try another profession, started as an engineer here and got really bored by it until I started guardian. If those don't work for ya maybe the game isn't for you.
---
Really tho? Legos require hundreds of hours, I know this fame is old AF but if the 'average scrub' that played this game has a Lego, this game would be doing amazing - not working out when life support mode starts in an xpac or two
---
I would describe that as more...mid-Searing?
---
I don't wanna see "MesmerMemer420xxx69 has gotten first place" while I'm busy AFKing thank you very much

the infusion drop rates from events are shamefully low.  Like I get they want those to be special, but, when its like .00001%, its not special, its just a waste of peoples time.

I suggested in a thread I made a bit back that Old LA should be a Guild Hall until some butthurt guy came and argued that it would be immersion breaking.  =I Im like. So?
---
I liked the ruined LA as it had a more historical look to it, like it had been standing for centuries before being destroyed. Now it's just a beach resort
---
Well, lore-wise, the old LA is akin to a city naturally built up over time, complete with slums. The new LA is essentially planned from the ground up, which feels quite clinical in contrast.

Probably RNG but he's noob

Split off a stack of how many you want to open (alt-drag the stack), leaving the rest in an [invisible bag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag#Invisible_bag_recipes). Open the new stack, and you can salvage-all the equipment while the old stack in the invisible bag remains untouched.
---
The red bar indicates when you are above the current maximum height for the skyscale. It has nothing to do with how much flight power (green bar) the skyscale has. It's 1350 units above the spot where you took off, and it slowly decreases as you move laterally. The only way to reset the max height is to land somewhere. Clinging to the edge of a wall/cliff does not count as "landing".
---
&gt; The whole idea of the red bar building up when you have flight juice
---
It doesn't. The red bar indicates how far you are above the current max height regardless of how much flight power you have. It starts at 1350 units above the point where you take off and it gets reduced as you move further away from that point laterally.
---
Also, "but if I ever use this skin I won't have to spend a transmutation charge on it if I safe the item version of the skin!"
---
Meanwhile, my pile of like 100+ transmutation stones I never use...
---
Please don't lewd the dragon.
---
I don't think you quite understand how the skyscale works, friend.
---
The red or brown portion of the bar shows how much you've gone past the flight canopy that is determined by the point from which you took off.
---
The more you intrude past the canopy, the more extra flight juice you need to compensate. 
---
Bond of Vigor does not remove bar depletion, it will only refill flight meter, and it can't refill the bar if you've gone too far past that the canopy limits. You will need to land or gather volatile magic to keep going.
---
I honestly always hated the old one, but then, I find the "ships turned into buildings" aesthetic to be uninspired.  
---
Granted, sea critters turned until buildings is only marginally less silly, but at least now the center of commerce in Central Tyria doesn't look like a Shantytown from head to toes.
---
My 80-odd Queen Jennah minis hasten to agree.

I enjoyed that.
---
That storm *is* him. He seems to coalesce into a dragon when he's actually doing stuff.
---
ok i figured out what happened. updating post shortly.
---
I simply got exited by exploring and all of the aspects of the game, I literally spent hours on my lvl 13 ranger going into lvl 80 areas looking for new pets, do some research on cool Easter eggs or fun mini games, try a new race, get into crafting(helpful when making legendary weapons) and again, explore what the game has to offer completely.
---
I'm saving all those skins for the day Anet decides to award a trans. stone when you break them up.  But I'm also saving all my Mini Queen Jennah's in case something ends up using them in a recipe.
---

---
It's not bad for endgame. Title please.
---
A well landed Overcharged Shot was an insta-death in that map,  because of said bs, they reworked the map so nobody could die by that,  they reworked it hard so it could be played competitively, eliminating random elements like that one
---
I have over 100 birthday boosts. And literally ever other boost.
---
Me, my brother and my cousin are getting back into it.
---
Was playing with my brother yesterday and he Went "Well fuck this, I'm gonna get ascended armor." and Went full on research on how to obtain it. So now I have to do it as well and beat him to it.
---
Soemtimes the flight juice from refilling drains when im not using it and sometimes it doesnt, does that depend on whether or not im inside the canopy
---
Necro is perfectly fine for fractals. Don't know who said otherwise, but they don't know what they're talking about.
---
You are way too late for that my friend
---
Just started with my family, however we are all different races. I figured how to get us to waypoint together, but will this affect those who are not from that race's starting area? (ex, Charr in Sylvari area) 
---
I want everyone to progress together and not lose out on some story or quests.
---
He could come from Kingdom Hearts
---
If you buy the expansions you get a boost for each one. Use those. You don’t need 80 levels to figure out a class. Don’t be afraid to just dive in with it! That’s what I did and it took me about 10 minutes to figure it out.
---
Yeah but in Dutch we have a separate `y` and `ij`, causing `y` to always be pronounced like `ee` in `bee` when it's at the end of a word like that, which in turn means not having an apostrophe doesn't change the sound
---
That poor guy just joined wvw for the 1. time and has no clue what is happening  :(
---
customizable guildhall arena exists, do it there.
---
While it's not an android app per se, http://gw2timer.com/ is a great website. You can use it to track world boss spawns and many other events and daily tasks. You can also tie your API to the website and get useful features like seeing what is in the inventory of your bank or alts.
---
As I pushed to 10k Diamond Legend, it was really nice to have the boosters.  As for all the other stuff like the 400+ transmutation charges, 18,000 spirit shards, 100k+ badges of honor....maybe some day.
---
well the npcs experieced a disaster. They aren't self aware of the game they just went through the change. Rebuilt LA and such
---
Way back when there was no level cap on entering the next story instance then what happened was the casual players were saying the game was too hard and anet had to revamp the leveling experience by putting level requirements for the instances and so that players be forced to explore other parts of the game like WvW and PvP. However, the constant power creeping via expacs made the WvW not worth for lowbies who haven't unlocked all the skills and gears, so cross that. Now for PvP, if you don't own expacs you can't play the other elite specializations (some more op than others) so you could play the vanilla class but it's much harder to be competitive unless you really know your shit (like condi guard, power ranger etc). Even the 'new' leveling experience added more loot as you level, the gears aren't always good to the point you start questioning whether the devs even play their game. Like rampagers gear on a vanilla warrior when most of weapon scale with power.
---
The real fun I have admit starts at level 80 with living story episodes, grind for legendaries and practice your dps skill rotation for hardcore content (raids, fractal challenge modes) with like 3 skill combo, then you learn in 5, then 10 skills.
---
Now going back to why the fuck is there leveling to begin with if game starts at 80? Because the leveling gives you time to learn every skill and traits as you get them (yes not relying too much on guides). Tho the end game build is limited to min max builds that's only for hardcore content, for open world, it's freedom for builds. You can be the tankiest control scrapper or the squishiest glass cannon ele/thief (lowest health pool).
---
How to make the leveling less tedious:
---
1. BUY YOUR GEAR AS YOU GO, so you won't feel weak.
---
2. Boosters go a loong way. You log off, the booster timer stops so maximize them. Wiki exp food and utilities.
---
3. Join a guild and find friends on discord to map around for exp.
---
4. Skip hearts and run for Point of Interests (POI), Vistas, exploration, orange circle events (escort is easiest, boss fights hardest).
---
5. /wiki et ; event timer for world boss if you're in the same map hit up the boss for bonus juicy exp.
---
6. Lastly (which most veterans still use to power level these days), have guildies help you run dungeons and every path is like 80% of a level, 3 paths usually in each dungeons, some have more.
---
7. Let's say you hate PvE, there's PvP (only recommend to people who know how to play their class), but pick a reward track that gives you exp tomes. 1 tome = 1 level.
---
I think you're bored cuz you are working with limited amount of skills. Trust me, the skill ceiling is very high in this game (more than final fantasy 14 imo) which is why the other players are gahgah-ing about. You will be overwhelmed if you jump to 80 with a booster.
---
I don't have over 100, but I do have a lot. 7 chars and a 5 year hiatus will give you LOTS of birthday boosters. 
---
Worth noting that if you pop one, it lasts for 24hrs in game time, not real life time. I've been in a state of permanent "celebration" for about 3 weeks now.
---
It's been a while since I've played, but for the life of me, I can't remember how to level outside of clicking tomes.
---
Nostalgia
---
For PvP. Don't expect to win 1v1 most of the time.
---
But yes you are very useful. 
---
Think of it as more supporting roll rather then straight up fighter. Push people off the points or help control movement of enemy and ally positioning.
---
B-but I'm going to need those boosters one day...!
---
Logging in daily, for the start. If you had done this during the five years you would be rolling in money now :)
---
Good times. I have great memories too
---
My boxes still stored at my family’s house
---
In my experience (did the cm 2 weeks after release and again sometime later) the main challenge was finding competent ppl, and staying focused for the whole fight. 
---
If you got 10 ppl that stay focused for 10 min straight its an "ez" kill.
---
Problem is every time you wipe you got to do the pre-event. And if you lose more than 1 player you can probably reset the fight. It is doable with 7 maybe 6 but if you are in a progression group that might not be the case.
---
The additional mechanics:
---
1. Additional HP make the fight longer and makes it more difficult to do the 10% phase with fewer players
---
2. Heavily-reduced healing for the Reapers forces at least someone to always pay attention to the spiders
---
3. Mini Dhuum punishes lack of concentration and reduces DPS uptime further increasing the kill time.
---
It was implied
---
Could work :)
---
Oh yeah, I've done that. Sadly, I tend to take hiatuses around festivals... but I also want to pop them around festivals.
---
Experience Scrolls? I've still got 3 lvl 60 scrolls I don't know what to do with.
---
Copper-Fed by a longshot. It'll be useful for the **vast** majority of the loot you get.
---
good points.
---
In between story just focus on your hero. You speak a bit like you know everything of your class.
---
Do you know traits? Skills? Did you tried all weapons yet? Keep changing your gameplay style messing with traits and skills. You won't have that much freedom at lvl 80 when scaling is different and to try stuff you would have to properly re-gear hero
---
NO. Because it doesn't matter if YOU have manners. Others don't. even if I have auto-decline dueling requests" checked, you know happens ? Assholes whisper you , over and over, calling you a pussy etc for having it checked and not dueling them. Then you have to go ahead and block them completely , which is another step , just like  manually turning down dueling requests would be,.
---
Staff is actually really devastating in the right situation if you're allowed to free cast. 
---
You just have to position yourself extremely well and avoid things like Thieves and Mesmers. Burning Retreat is your lifeline, so use it wisely and stay near your support (if you have one) once it's down.
---
Yeah consuming a charge for everything discourages experimentation and reduces diversity. And it makes the whole system almost stressful instead of fun.
---
Ele is squish no matter which elite spec you play. Tempest is maybe a little more durable than weaver by default but the defensive skills on weaver sword kind of cancel that out.
---
You just aren't understanding how this game works. There are literally hundreds of free looks. Just play the game.
---
Silverwastes is the easy gold farm for newbies.
---
Idk but definitely **don’t** buy the zephyrite supply boxes lol
---
I think that in addition to a perma duel block option, requiring the players to both be on each other's friend list would prevent a lot of spam and if you have an annoying friend you can just toggle the option.
---
I think there are other things to "fix" or add first before we actually need duelling. You already can due, WvW, Guild Hall, PvP.
---
It could be a technical thing though. The game AFAIK only knows two states friendly or enemy (okay 3 but the passive "yellow enemies" are not really important in this case) and while we have seen that ArenaNet can switch "teams" of a player as we have seen in the Hearts and Minds Story mission in Heart of Thorns it might not possible to just enable this for specific players and only for them.
---
Because this could potentially bring other problems with it. If those players who duel are enemies then how does everyone else sees them? Friendly? Enemy but invulnerable? Passive? a completely new state? And there lies the problem, if it is friendly then players could just stand beside them and pump buffs, effect or even heals to one or both players. With Enemy and invulnerable I don't think that this can be that selective on what damage is getting through and what is not since this is code used all over the game so changing it for duel would change it for everything.
---
In my opinion, it would be a gimmick. Everyone would play the crap out of duelling in the first week and then it would be forgotten. I don't know, I did duels in WoW but never felt the need to do this in GW2 because the game isn't really about playing against other players in a not PvP context.
---
I didn’t know I needed this till now
---
Just a side question, do you know you can be both? And switch outside of battle between them?
---
In pvp, revenant (sword/sword/staff herald roamer).
---
In wvw, revenant (hammer herald dps)
---
In endgame pve, both (boon chrono, condi mirage, alacrity renegade)
---
You are way overthinking it my dude, and you are kind also shifting the narrative I was never talking about "fixing" anything, I was talking about adding an option to duel people, it's not uncommon at all to see this in an MMO. Dueling has been a thing in MMOs for quite some time now ones much older than guild wars 2 have had no issues allowing localized duels via invites. You are acting like this is a PVE only game and forgetting that it already has PVP so dueling would be very easy for a developer to implement into the game. It's just a suggestion and it would not affect you or anybody who does not want to be bothered by it.
---
Wieso Magi und nicht Arzneikundler? Ist krit wohl wichtiger als Kraft oder hat das nen anderen Grund?
---
I wouldn't recommend it for other games, but boost to 80 and get to the post base game maps. With the map meta and clear rewards/achievements to grind for, it's a much more focused experience. I used WvW to grind to 80 way back and I feel like I didn't miss too much.
---
That was me with PvP glory boosters.  Then they removed you from PvP and my stacks of boosters poof.  =(
---
No, I don't want to duel random PVP gods in a custom lobby, I am talking about being able to send a duel invite to a friend in a  PVE zone and having a short duel ensue within the next 3-5 seconds.
---
How do I overthink this by stating the problems of how gw2 does things. Yeah pvp already exists but it is different to have a map that is under pvp rules than having two players fight against each other in pve.
---
And no just because a game has pvp doesn't mean it would be easy to have dueling.
---
I mean look at guild halls arena. We still can't use pvp rule set there because the map is a pve zone.
---
This was also not something to offend you but rather point out issues this idea has that would need to be addressed and talk about like the points I have made with player interference.
---
So I don't care about dueling others do care but there are still problems that have to be addressed for it to be possible.
---
Oh and by the way, in software development it is never "just add it" or "just because they have x they also can do y" or "it is easy" because it is always easy to say those things if you don't have a clue how this stuff is coded
---
Runeforger's. Even if you use it on everything, you won't spend *htat* much gold salvaging.
---
SFX is "sound effects" but I'm just going to assume it means "shadow FX" or "smoke FX" in this case
---
it's such a petty gripe when the community gets all up in arms about something that would not even affect them such as two friends dueling each other.
---
What kind of skins/look were you trying for?
---
Oh right my bad
---
Correct. You have to be on the same story step while in the same instance when it ends to progress your story.
---
note username of last comment
---
The option should be used by people who want to duel. Not by the one who disagree the system.
---
if you plan on being just 1% efficient, dont do this.
---
What is this?
---
if it is designed for PVP then yes it is designed for duels as well as 1v1 combat can happen in WvW and SPVP this it was designed for 1v1 happening in PVP
---
Sc/W tempest is pretty good, around 35k dps.
---
 https://youtu.be/fHhFUqkiWl4 (build is also on the snow crows website)
---
think of it as you building your legend between story missions. these dry spells between every 10 levels are for you to experience the map metas, champs, random npc dialogues, and of course your level loot for something to wear, or gain some money to buy something to wear.
---
not that dungeons are as common anymore to people leveling up, but youre meant to do them as part of your story when you get the email inviting you to do so. theyre like side stories that run parallel to the main story with characters that you meet in the main story.
---
Yes, because it's not sold as solo speed run, just solo. You can do it in full knight, for all we care. If you're not interested, you can pass.

---
Random spammy invites to duel from random trash player playing an equally trashy, degenerate build.  Oh and it'd be using PvE balance which is already garbage for PvP.
---
Funny part is that it didn’t used to be like that. There weren’t 10 level gaps as far as I can recall, but can’t recall how it actually was. Perhaps smaller level gaps, more gradual.
---
Okay well, you have a very counter intrusive opinion that comes off angsty. End of story.
---
Sure glad I stopped at Ascended gear, this must be annoying I imagine.
---
The other thing to remember is that on sword Weaver you have access to a lot of evades.
---
Why not just play both tho. I myself do a LOT of trait, utility and weapon swapping between encounters and different types of content for ALL of my characters.
---
What if you could trade them in for Mystic Coins, just make then soulbound so they don't screw up the economy?
---
Everquest online adventures for the PS2 had duels for crying out loud man I am sorry to tell you this but you are making it out to be way harder then it really is. It's literally old tech at this point to allow duels in your game. This is a developer choice at this point and it's clear for whatever reason they did not want duels in their game. Maybe because it would expose balance issues, or cause toxicity, whatever the reason adding duels into guild wars 2 would be child's play for the dev team at ArenaNet if they so wanted to make it happen.
---
I don't think this subreddit allows NSFW posts :(
---
Aahh ofc, and it has a small delay thats why the skill is on CD and i couldn’t see it. Thanks.

Oh the Ball lightnings
---
Nice pun :)
---
He knows a lot more than he shares out of his own personal ethical code, he's like Nick Fury from Shield except if Nick Fury released heavily redacted top secret files.
---
&gt; I will leave the developing, to the developers.
---
Yeah I got that from your post since you have not spend any time on thinking how this actually would work or what problems could turn up because of it.
---
If we go that route then this sub would be in infestation of one liners of things they want to have in the game.
---
I don't really know what you expect with such mindset, praises on how good your idea is? Or don't you just want to discuss this and just use reddit as a blog?
---
I mean, reddit is for discussing things so I was mentioning those things that should be addressed with this and that it isn't as easy as you might think and yet you get all defensive about it instead of just going with it or just ignore the comment if you don't like it.
---
And again, just because other games have it makes it in any case relevant that it also has to be in GW2 or that it is in any way easier for it to be in there. This is not some code fragment that you just copy paste somewhere or include a certain library that already does everything for you, no, it is a lot of work because you need to consider what is already in the game that you have to change to make it work. "I want dueling" is a nice though but the more interesting part is how you would do that.
---
Try ff14
---
I suppose another question would be are there other GW2 Dataminers out there that are unscrupulous as opposed to the code Shaman has.
---
Your English is confusing me, maybe it is not a game for you. Gw2 was made for casuals as its priority, but maybe your way too casual for it.
---
you were just unlucky
---
Just stop and listen to yourself, we are talking about a game that literally has hundreds of players on screen PVPing with each other, having just 1v1 would be trivial in comparison to 100v100. You don't have a leg to stand on when you keep bringing up the amount of work it would take as they have already gone above and beyond simple 1v1 PVP, asking that it be included into the game does not warrant a consumer discussion about how much developer time it would take. I already stated how it should be done in my OP as a consumer I have done my part and suggested how I think it should be done. However, I never stated I was a developer with my own personal code or programming on the matter as I did not know that was a required when leaving basic ass feedback about wanting duel invites in Guild wars 2.
---
Or you know just preview before you actually make the change
---
Hehe
---
Many thanks
---
Would be so up for this
---
😂
---
If both pizza places make an amazing pizza I could never replicate myself because I lack the skill and execution, then I couldn't care less if one pizza takes 10 and the other takes 20 minutes. They are both absolutely amazing. 
---
So if you go and tell me that the second pizza is bad because it took 10 minutes longer, I will definitely ask you to show me how you make an amazing pizza like that in less than 20 minutes.
---
Was going to comment the same thing.
---
Correct, and if you're free to play, you actually can't enter lion's arch until level 35 anyways
---
C&amp;C also has some grind, but at least the story it tells is nice enough to bear it
---
When I was leveling I found completing the maps I was in a fun way to get to a higher level. You get XP for doing everything, even crafting, so maybe try doing map completion in the maps you like until you get a high enough level
---
That is how RNG works. Sometimes you get lucky and think that this is a normal thing and then you get crap out of it and think it got worse. No, RNG is always bad you just got lucky when you get something out of it.
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaand you got baited by a troll. keep calm and stay focused! ;p
---
Eeeeaxactly. One of the decorations requires a single person to do a full map complete for the world map gift. This item is of course soulbound. You cannot buy or trade for the item.   
---
One poor scribing sap has to map complete. And if you want another one of the same decoration. It's another map completion for that poor scribe. Insane.
---
Not an app, but [http://thedaemonarmy.com](http://thedaemonarmy.com/) is a site for finding the best locations to do dailies.
---
Well, if you "just like dueling". Then you can have this in guild hall and sPvP custom arenas. You request to have it open, where everybody else can see it. Consider this to be something like a "buttcrack of an old obese man: Most people don't want to see it at all.
---
My suggestion would be, to have pits or fighting rings at certain locations in the open world. Like one in every major city and maybe some scattered around tyria. You can use them similar to the fight challanges in the four winds festival, where you enlist yourself or pick oponents, which are already enlisted. This way, people who want to see the fights or participate in them, can go there and do so. Meanwhile you don't bother the other like 80% of playerbase with your passion for 1v1.
---
I’ve played both games and quit ESO as it is so greedy. Yes, you unlock some very basic skins and items through questing but any good looking skins must be bought with real money. Made bad leveling choices as a newbie? Tough luck, grind some gold or pay cash to fix it! Same goes with most of the mount skins. Was lucky to get one skin from community event. You need days of grinding for even basic gear let alone getting max level for WvW.
---
On GW2 you can unlock most of the skins through gameplay by crafting, collecting and some grinding. The only exception being mount and glider skins and some exclusive skins which are a small minority of the content. And you can just farm gold and swap it to gems which as, far as i know, is something you can’t do in ESO. The skill level requirement for PvE is very low except raids and some fractals. Check the Guild Wars 2 wiki and you can see that there are plenty of skins you can get just by playing the game. Find the ones you like and complete the quests to get them. Doing scavenger hunts should be a breeze to you as you have the raptor mount. Most of us had no mounts when we started so getting around was much slower. Also, remember that dying gear is an easy and cheap way to make your gear look much better. And it is much easier  and cheaper than in ESO!
---
To me it sounds like you lack a lot of basic knowledge on how this game works. You need to tone down some graphics settings if your fps gets too low. My 4 year old laptop runs stuff like Dragonfall okay. Maybe you could join a PVE guild so they could help you get started? Most of us were pretty clueless after getting our first lvl 80 characters. Rushing around using lvl 80 boost and teleport to friends doesn’t work in the long run and demotivates you. You need to learn the basics first.
---
Thanks for tripple checking it!
---
The reason, why I insisted that much on it, was that there have been plans to add your data to the wiki drop rate research. However, I have blocked this.
---
Now, with all it would be much appreciated if you allow us to add your data to the [Zephyrite Supply Box/Drop rate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Supply_Box/Drop_rate) page.
---
I used 90 keys and 10 gold just for the new outfit. I got maybe like 10 rares.
---
The golds werent tooooo bad, i got 3gold keys as one drop, and the mount, rest were crappy skins.
---
I know i need to chill. xD
---
I understand what you mean, I play MMOs for 20 years now so I pretty much have seen a lot of those functionalities that you talk about.
---
However, I am not confused by those aspects because it doesn't matter how they have solved it since what you see doesn't necessarily mean is how it works since, as I said "just disable it" is a very laymens view on those things. Again, I try to figure out how they would do because that is what interests me and have a discussion about it.
---
Not every MMO is alike, others have done it but that doesn't mean that how they did it would work in how Gw2 works. GW2s combat is different and while certain things are similar they are most likely or definitely coded differently. 
---
So, while you say that others can't heal or support you is true and obviously should be implemented and that is why I mentioned the part that we actually know from which source a Buff is being applied to you. There we know for sure that we could block any buffs from an outside source but the code could be different for healing or Combo fields. That is also why I said you shouldn't be able to interact with anything except your own stuff in a Duel.
---
So, Yeah, duels are not something new to MMOs but you can't just go to Blizzard or any other MMO developer and ask them how they did it and even if they would tell you, their solution is most likely not something that works in GW2.
---
You seem to misunderstand me constantly, Software and game development is not something blocky, some certain things that never change but rather something needs to fit your current code base, as I said already multiple times, it doesn't matter that other MMOs already have "solved" because how GW2 does things and handles combat and interaction of players it most definitely is not something you just do the same, nor that we want to really.
---
What I mean is, having an electric motor in a car is great to have but it follows different specs and connectors than what your car might need or expects which also means the argument of "other have already solved it" can't be applied here because as far as how GW2 handles combat they need to solve this issue again. Sure, the end product would be duels in GW2 but that isn't the point.
---
Yeah, yeah... this isn’t WoW, bud.
---
ikr, ive checked ur site month ago for info in comments, and still checking in very often with hope for new content.
---
yes,u dont, but pvp or wvw will take more time to get a set, especially if pvp is off season, i believe? i mentioned to most easy ways to get ascended gear, in terms of effort and time spent. Op dont seem to be wvw/pvp player, looks more like pve one. so i mentioned only those too, to make it clear and that game is not forcing him to run pvp/wvw to get gear.
---
im perfectly fine as long as there is no rng, instead they can make 3k gems for that cosmic outfit, but they making tilting gambling which is out of laws in some countries. thats the point. or make such rng shit tradeable just like perma contracts.
---
All of them are “viable.”
---
what to do with mystic coins other than legendary crafting?
---
petition to add regex filtering
---
Yes, we are moving straight into Season 5... and ANet has an announcement on August 30th about it.
---
main part is RNG LOOT, its not pay2best gear, but some things might help u do it faster if u gamble. means gives advantages - throw money - spent less time on boring thing.
---
well idk how it is in usa, just assumed that there are more comfortable to make some donations and get useful things instead of grinding everyday for gold. im sorry if im wrong.
---
did u played gw2 before addons? there was no acc bound rng loot in BLC, got a rare drop which u dont want or need? u can TP it. fair statement. and they were working on with old content, since addons they dont give a shit about bugs which exist since game launch, so its just throwing new content and giving 0 value the old one, which is fun, enjoyable and playable, but needs some attention.
---
Change class maybe
---
another duel spam invites argument. Give it a rest, I already stated in the OP, that is a non-issue with the ability to go into your options and disable duel invites from being sent to you. Do you have a valid concern as to why 2 friends dueling would bother you? Please do explain how your PVE experience would just be ruined if such a thing were to be in the game.
---
Pugging fracs? Tempest!
---
WvW dps? Weaver!
---
Dying a lot? Tempest! Tempest offers a lot of baked in survivability options, and great range control. By which I mean that if the thing you nuked from range didn't die and came to you in melee, you can just overload an element (preferably air) and there you have a melee range AOE field. While you're learning, tempest traitlines offer more survivability boons than weaver, too, and learning weaver swapping is......well, you should probably get used to the skills on tempest first.
---
That's me in every RPG.
---
Just to spare others the confusion: the video is not about the climb, abut being up there and flying down.
---
explanation needed......how does one do this?
---
Yes, happened to me [too](https://i.imgur.com/cj4i7We.png)..sadly it does not save it :/
---
There is basically bis permanent for each rarity: Blue: Copper-fed, Green: Runeforger's, Yellow: Silver-fed. If you only wanna buy one of those -&gt; copper-fed it is. Runeforger's is really really niche since it's worse for everything else than greens. You are just better off using copper-fed to blues and greens and rare/mystic salvage kit to yellows.
---
Wat. This changes everything
---
Guilty...I hoard things for *years*. I *just* ran out of kralkachocolate bars a few months ago. I'd decided to use them more frequently since there are other consumables that not only increase karma gain but  give a higher percent back, and since karma food was rare back then, I don't have to worry about straight running out of karma food anymore. Ofc, they bring dragon bash back, and now I'm sitting on all these consumables like I'll never see them again.
---
Well that's actually the whole story of GW and GW2 in a nutshell.
---
Man, that's one of the games where leveling is even bigger pain in the ass. That game has brutal issue with it, at least for most people. If you love to do repeatable same quests and reading through story, then ye, it might be good, but most of people see it as absolutely boring leveling with no alternatives. Ye, the newest parts might be good but guess what, you *need* to do the shitty ones first, or buy a skip and lose whole story point.
---
So no, this is absolutely bad advice if this guy finds even GW2's leveling boring.
---
That's what I call my wanger
---
"Hello! Welcome to the Fissure of Woe! You must die..."
---
I was able to do this at some point earlier in the year by accident but couldn't figure out consistent repro to be able to dye both top and bottom. Ended up only being able to dye one or the other but didn't spend much time figuring out how to get it to 100% repro for both. Has to do with switching visibility between outfit, helm, shoulders, and gloves.
---
I'm dumb what kp is there for t4s?
---
Too little sample for educated guesses. No, they become slightly better for veterans who dont need makeover kits.
---
Okay, I got few points to highlight there.
---
First, the level of zone is not hard barrier. It is easy to get into lvl 80 zones  even on way lower level, even though extremely hard. I have history of being in Dry Top since lvl 50...significantly easier to do once you have mounts and masteries. Do this if you want real challenge, but I would say that going for higher difference than 15 levels is not really useful as you can't tag anything and you instadie on one hit. But with closer level it is fine. Getting HoT/PoF hero points early works though (most of them). Verdant Brink boxes do drop level apropriate loot so it is even nice way to gear up while leveling. But it is really challenge to just run and hide.
---
You can try PvP . You get full access to your whole class even before you unlock stuff through levels, and play with all of that. You also get tomes of knowledge for instant lvlups.
---
Dungeons if you want to get levels quick. Best to do every path once a day.
---
Don't optimize your gameplay though. Deoptimize it, rather. Do stuff that is out of ordinary. 
---
PS: if you want to get lost in a game and vanish from real world, try Factorio. 100% guarantee.
---
Then one drops and you get a cowsplat.
---
Maybe you can make an inspired art on this matter ;)
---
I agree. Open world 1v1 dueling like other games would be nice. Can fight at different locations (like picking a fighting stage, what good is it if the pretty maps are underutilized)
---
I felt this on a **spiritbound** level
---
As much as you try to ignore what other already told you as answers, it IS a valid concern. There are shitty people and they WILL try to force you into these 1v1 and they WILL start talking crap, start whispering, follow you arund, ect. I don't want any of this in the PvE. I have enough of this in WvW and sPvP.
---
And yes, this IS one of those "some few shitty people ruin it for everybody" issues.
---
Besides this: If you want to fight 1v1 in the open world, where everybody else is playing as well. What happens if an enemy NPC is nearby? What happens if a random (non 1v1 player) is using an AoE heal skill or throws a combo field into your "perfect 1v1"? Your suggestion is nice, but it rly rly rly invites trolls to troll like hell.
---
Really, either keep it in prepared open world spaces or leave it in the existing spots.
---
And yes that's my opinnion on this subject and it's as valid as yours. And from what I get in this thread, my / similar to my opinnion overweigths yours. Thus you may be in a minority. Thus maybe it's not a good idea to implement something for a minority, which will anny a majority.
---
I'm just typing my opinion, You're getting all angry and copy-pasting shitty articles.
---
You haven't addressed anything I've said in regards to to realistic expectations.
---
&gt;I can't find any common ground with anything you say so, goodbye.
---
Ah you're just looking for an echo chamber, I see.
---
Adios.
---
I would say a lot has changed since the game originally released.
---
Like peaceful cooperative PvE becoming the main content and WvW/PvP losing development attention.
---
My dude *what*?
---
Join a training guild/discord, or start your own squad with 0 LI/KP requirements....
---
Stop expecting to get carried &amp; have everything handed to you. Some experienced raiders simply don't have the time or desire to group up with people doing the boss for the first time, and want to play with raiders of an equal/similar level... and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
The first two (farmed) keys this month gave me the mount skin and 3 golden keys. Thank you for your contribution towards maintaining RNG balance.
---
&gt; something that would not even affect them such as two friends dueling each other.
---
have you considered the impacts of duels on surrounding pve elements?
---
ex: are you and your friend scaling up surround events without contributing to them?
---
are you pulling aggro from mobs? are you invulnerable to them during the duel?  if not, is this an easy way to pop-out of danger?
---
do your combo elements interact with those not in the duel?
---
etc..
---
Nope. All they care about is to make GW2 into a single-player story-driven 'MMO'. Soon they'll just delete PvP and WvW because of purity of purpose.
---
30 copper per use... copper fed is 3 copper per use.. copper fed is 25% off.. I wonder what one is better atm..
---
I think the safest assumption is that Fractals are "finished" until we're told otherwise.
---
Skritt: "Skritt is a very good at the time you need to be able to get the appeal!"
---
Vigil Warmaster: "That's a lot of people who are going to get it."
---
Atleast the whispers globe they added later was much more worth it, I suppose
---
there's nothing toxic about players that feel that way, stop lashing out. 
---
you're making a weak case weaker every time you trot out "it could only help", "it wouldn't affect anyone else", "good riddance to those that don't agree with me"
---
look, this argument has been had in here for 7 years now and you're not making any points that haven't been made dozens of times.. and by continuing to ignore the possibility that this isn't an absolute positive for everyone involved, you come off as ill-informed and as someone that hasn't thought much of this trough.
---
I just wish ranger had more meta build options than just boonbeast.
---
then these 2 random friends can go and guel somewhere else, like GH or pvp. We are telling you that majority of the population dont want old school true random duels and such, they dont like some random guys lagging out already laggy maps or taking place in full meta maps doing nothing to help the community, beside scaling up the events. But it seems youve taken this post as a 1v1 keyboard warrior duel already, and you just refuse to accept other ppl oppinions. If you want to duel random stangers, just que for pvp, or use the already existing infrastructure.
---
"if you're not interested in my reply you can pass"
---
see how dumb it sounds?
---
the scope seems to be the "area" of access you give the API-Key for the API-Request.
---
So in the case of the /account states you would only need the Account Scope but for the fractal_level you would also need the Progression scope.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:API_key
---
The preview windows is too constrained for this.
---
You need an opportunity to actually see your new armor, weapons, character design in action. Movement, combat, idle, in different areas with different lighting.
---
There needs to be a sealed off area, much like the vip pass areas, where you can be teleported from within the wardrobe and styling / makeover kit interfaces that allow you to actually preview your settings in a small but playable environment.
---
Thanks! That was all it was, it's working as intended now! Can't believe I overlooked something so simple!
---
Yep! That was it lol. Thanks for the prompt reply, was a very simple error to make!
---
Yes that was it! Was definitely overthinking things!
---
tbf you are the toxic one who is lashing out and threatening to quit over a hypothetical feature that would not affect the way you play the game.
---
&gt; You are mad 
---
???
---
Yeah, defo not the dude attacking people if they don't want dueling added.
---
&gt;toxic people like you 
---
You are arguing with everyone, calling people toxic because they don't want a feature you do while copy-pasting some article and saying "Im right!! It's in an article!!!"
---
&gt;stop trying to make Guild Wars 2 an unfriendly place for other people, try to be a little more considerate about other people than just yourself.
---
Oh please, give it a rest.
---
I can finally run around with my big burly max size norn naked while actually having armor, this is the greatest thing ever
---
Commander tag is a good investment for that stuff, you have to start early and snowball your own group for kills. Had no trouble with V.4 two months ago.
---
I am fine posting here in the gw2 Reddit, it seems many people have a like-minded concern here and over on the gw2 forums, and hell even random people making articles on their MMO websites. I'm glad there is a concern for dueling in gw2, to be honest. Thanks for the chat, I had fun, Don't let played feedback and Posts on Reddit get you down.
---
"Accidentally".  All that lotion on their hands made their fingers slip.
---
Don't forget to boost your magic find before you open the gnashblade chest.
---
I don't know what you're talking about with FFXIV, because their community resources absolutely kick the shit out of this game's.
---
The other three I'll grant you, but to be fair, at least one of those (B&amp;S) is basically generic asian trash despite the super fun combat.
---
That's a slightly modified right part of the image posted by /u/Martian_on_the_Moon [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cm2une/shadow_warrior_without_his_sfx/). It somehow looked like a meme - probably the warrior making some decision, then hearing something, and reverting his decision. So here's a take on it, and also a [template](https://i.imgur.com/raJ5dFi.png).
---
Everything you don't agree with is angsty. Your very reaction is the reason I don't want dueling in the game. It doesn't bring to the game people I think I'd want to play with. 
---
You dismiss offhandedly everyone's concerns because you don't agree with them, and then label them angsty, accusing them of not letting you have your opinion. How about letting them have theirs?
---
This is me, but with all the containers that contain skins i have to choose from, maybe i need a special one later on which i cant get anymore if i choose one right now. ._.
---
Hello all,
---
Considering playing again. Has it become any easier to sidegrade your gear? I remember when I last played, switching from Zerk to Ele condi would require me to farm a huge amount of map currency or do achievements from LS to get all the trinkets and at the same time farm loads of spirit shards to convert my armor into the one I need (or craft new).  
---
Has any of that changed or been made easier? I am keen on trying out a condi Ele but I cba to have to play for a month before I can play what I want to play.
---
looks like an enemy from maximo vs. the army of zinn
---
Oof, that went right over my head hahaha
---
Final battle  
---
56 megalixirs  
---
...still don't use them.
---
My main issue is the trinkets. I can just change my legendary weapons and potentially craft new armor (thought I'd rather change the current one if spirit shards were easier to get). I don't want to play with exotics.
---
So what they are probably doing is looking at other LFGs to figure it out.
---
The same thing happened all the time in GW1 with people selling/buying "ambraces" or "ambrances" when in reality the item they were trying to trade was an "armbrace."
---
Not sure how to explain the whole "turrents" thing at Tequatl though.
---
Destiny has kept the same aesthetic and it still looks great. You can easily tell which exotic someone is wearing just by looks alone, it's distinctive and feels special. It's not impossible to keep the art integrity in a game, they just have to say no to huge cheap particle effects even if they sell well.
---

weird... this doesn't work for me. it just stays on the outfit if i toggle my headpiece.
---
There isn't an all encompassing build for firebrand. You COULD run one build for everything but you'll be losing out on "most effectiveness." Currently full minstrels is the staple in WvW and somethin not even close to that for fracs. Some classes might have 1 build that works but firebrands a little oof in that regard. It's why I just switched to power DH. I got a little overwhelmed at the cost of making a firebrand build for each sitch
---
I think a loss of only 25% is very good, If people would win money by buying insane amounts of these boxes, the result would be that the boxes (the materials you need for them) rise even more and this will result in the same as now... Gambling isnt there to make save money, so I dont see any point in rising the drops.
---
About wvw can't tell you much, but considering overall pve, you can't go wrong picking zerker or viper. With proper build and runes you can be very good dps/support as viper and pretty much the same with zerker, with an extra option of going DH too. 
---
Those builds will make you most wanted in fractals, raids if you want to, and won't hinder your open world enjoyment because you have good dps.
---

---
That'd be awesome!  We could call it... hell... I had something. Started with an 'N'?
---
Are you sure you have your outfit toggled off
---
Honestly, this meme describes exactly how I feel about the game right now. I hope that LW5's announcement is good, for the sake of both it's players and the game's shaky future.
---
But they should also keep the old verson revisitable. I will never be able to properly experience old LA, un-destroyed Kessex Hills or pre-Mordremoth Iron Marches.
---
I don't see a single thing on that youtube channel that shows anywhere near the amount of skill required to do what OP has done in his video. Aside from the terrible video titles and random benchmarks, all this person does is 99/100CM in a regular party. Pretty much the very definition of a "random nobody".
---
Of course, was only half serious anyway
---
I've been running a power "dps" in t2-3 fractals. All exotic equipment except trinkets. I tend to get 9-11k dps, give people constant superspeed and combo fields, and am tanky. It's fun and can carry pretty well but if that's your goal I kept wondering why am I not reaper?
---
It does spit out a lot of boons if you don't have a dedicated source of might, superspeed and protection, which is nice.
---
Wouldn't do t4.
---
Hahahahahah
---
Last opponent sounds like a train departing.

Underrated comment

That outfit is on everybody and their goldfish at this point. Outfits are not very wardrobe you simply look exactly the same as the 50 people standing next to you with the exact same outfit just colors might be different. So hype now, but tomorrow you don't want to have 50 twins you want to look special. 
---
And if things goes as they have so far, it will turn up in the statuettes soon. So don't worry you will get it because Arena Net have made sure that you don't have to be left out you just have to wait a while.
---
For the potato cam to take a screenshot of it :-)
---
Quickbrand is still full viper.
---
I still secretly hope that we get bamboozled and they actually reveal an expansion...
---
RNG got worse and worse since last summer. I used to buy a lot od key, as well as opening a large amount of event bags during festival. Nowdays they're just a material sink, you get absolutely nothing good at all.
---
Oh so there is other people doing this silly thing. I watch those buffs on my bank and thining why the hell do i not use them. And the voice in my head say because maybe you need them later and you don't want to run out...
---
I did this too for years until i realised i have about 1 k of transmutation stones and can get 5k more if i use up all those piled up wvw boxes (yes i am a horder) and about half a year back i decided that it is super dumb and i throwed all the skins away. 
---
Now i wait for A-Net ot make upgraded versions of skins that i had and have because those things always happens.... right? :D
---
My vanilla Guardian is an ass-kicker
---
The build editor looks so nice and feels more comfortable to use. :D Thank you!
---
runeforger's is a newer one so comparatively it's less necessary but by comparison salvaging rares unless you're salvaging en mass are still probably better with mystic salvage kit instead. It's probably more accurate to suggest a mix of what you said and the above user.

Thank you for participating in the beta test for our new feature.

&gt; Jokes aside, fixing formatting in this comment to make it easier to read for other people. Just tell me to delete it when you fix the main post.

Hmm, what do you mean? I really can't see any difference in formatting between my post and your comment. Could you say more detailed?

AWESOME!

Saddle up, folks. It's donation time again. Forget that latte today. GW@Skill.Net is a *much* better investment.
---
Exactly. After how half assed PoF was a Cantha will never live up to weeb hype.
---
Maybe for the first hour.  After that isnt the worst grind of all MMos since there is no payoff.
---
Legendary armor fits all.

Otherwise no, there isn't one prefix for all game modes.

---
-What stats do you want?  
---
-Yes.
---
+1 on this. I think toggle on frac potions along with a "enter your true agony resistance" to overwrite the AR you get from anywhere else would work fine. So you could simply add your AR via all the things like infusions, augmentations, tear as the user.
---
This would literally never happen in the open world.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply, even though I am a little late, somehow i didnt notice your post when you posted it, so I only read it now after I tagged you in a different post of the current festival.
---
&gt; Our Quality Assurance team is truly amazing. When you are working on a feature it can be hard to see it clearly. Our QA teams have saved many releases. Not just from bugs but from design flaws that would have created negative experiences.
---
Can you share any interesting bugs they found before releases or some that would have had a major impact on the economy?
---
YES! You are the best. Thankyou so much for your hard work man. Seriously, without this site, my million alts wouldn't be as awesome as they are. The best build editing site I've ever seen for any game.
---
Can’t you add core ranger to this list as viable too?
---
I Connor McLeoud a fictional name? Are you Russian?
---
So what you're saying is that your mother language determines how good you are at the game?
---
not just me, many others here have said they would like dueling here as well so I don't know why you think it's just me and me alone that has a concern for dueling. I understand there is a strict few here that hates the thought of it as well and that is fine. You are entitled to your own opinion =)
---
I'd kill to have it available. games feel so much more alive when there's people kicking each others asses for fun. 
---
The current options are shite cause they force you to leave your map. It would be so much better if we could kill time waiting for time gated events by killing each other.
---
Core guard is alright in raids and fractals too if you can keep aegis up.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/clmoqt/temporarily_disabled_item_deposit_into_guild_banks/
---
they disabled that yesterday. You just have to wait a bit. I think there was possibly some kind of bug with it...
---
There are other people who are pro dueling, but you're the ONLY one I see dismissing the legitimate concerns of others. People have had bad experiences with something deserve better than being dismissed as angsty by some guy who has Palawa Joko's empathy.  I'm not against people wanting dueling, even though I don't want it myself. But I am against dismissive people who think that they have the right to post without anyone disagreeing with them. If you'll note it's not just a few people against it either, since more than 50% of the votes on your post have been downvotes. Have a nice day.
---
Nice work keeping backwards compatability with old links!
---
Yes, this is my nickname since the dawn of internet :) And yes - I'm Russian
---
I would suggest you read the information on PvP found in the GW2 [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Player_versus_Player)
---
Funny. But fuck loot boxes.
---
I didn't use this before, because I found it clunky. After playing around for just a little bit, I can say that this is hands above the old interface. It's more intuitive, far easier to use, more convenient over all.
---
This is a big, big improvement. Kudos to all those involved in this update.
---
Try costume brawling. It is available here and now. It can be done anywhere any time.
---
If you have a  [Water Fight Balloon Bucket](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Water_Fight_Balloon_Bucket) or one of the other toys that enable ppl to join in, you can duel with your friends and anyone else who wants to join, no invitation necessary. And you don't involve ppl who don't want to be involved either so every is happy.
---
I think you missed the guardian's toughness buff, since you're adding all the profession shared passives, might as well add that one.
---
The 30th is going to be a wildcard for everyone.  I'm not really expecting an expansion style content dump; at best I'd say we're going to get a trailer showcasing 5-8 expansion-tier features that'll trickle in over the course of the season ^when ^they're ^ready.  It'd be nice if you were right though.  I think the living world template is getting pretty stale for most people.
---
Looks fancy
---
Thanks. After reading that, I assume when ppl talk about "solo roaming" they mean running around in World vs. World alone?
---
At baseline I wanna increase my pvprank from the character  selectscreen and have some casual fun (I guess that takes 5v5 arena out of the equasion?).
---
When joining world vs. world I can choose between colors, what does that do?

It might've been when the sigil/rune rework was done but now as the market has saturated you are better off salvaging rares with silver-fed because of the 5% extra chance for ectos.
---

My experiences with support over 7 years has been pretty much all good. I think there was one bad experience in all that time, but a host of good ones. That doesn't always necessarily mean super fast, however. It depends on what the problem is, what the backlog is. Most recently I had a good experience with them when I crafted the wrong item and they got back to me in about a day and refunded that mats I'd used, after I'd destroyed it.
---
Aside from how viable chrono is after every major balance patch, the gw2 classes dont have proc-based rng or anything along those lines in their kit (besides critchance). Everything you can slot into your rota happens deterministically based on your trades (nothing has a chance to give you might/fury/etc., if you have a trait that can give you might/... it always will if you fulfill its condition (hp thresholds etc.)
---
We wanted the characters in Lion's Arch to reflect a variety of opinions about the rebuild. Some citizens would long for the L.A. of the past, whereas others would be optimistic and embrace the new city's design. This was a deliberate choice when we wrote the ambient scenes, the tour, etc.

All around is celestial. But that's not good for pve  
---
Just get yourself two sets, zerk for pve and whatever is played in wvw
---
Lol. It doesn't. From exotic to ascended is maybe like a 5% increase upgrade. If you're just "trying it out" then exotics are good enough.  Go spend one day in bitterfrost and get your trinkets. I am amazed how you can complain about this easy stuff. If you honestly just wanted to try it out go hit pvp and some golems
---
Keeping the game alive through your hard work. We who are about to buildcraft, salute you!
---
I remember reading about it in one of the Q&amp;As after an episode but I can't remember which one, sorry :/
---
The game is plenty busy. That said, it's not going to be for everyone, which is the same is every single MMO on the planet. This game fits my playstyle better than any other MMO I've ever played. That doesn't mean it's going to fit your play style.
---
There's plenty to do in the game. I basically do the stuff I want to do.   As for it losing popularity, that's what you get from reading reddit. I'm not seeing evidence of it in game. Maybe RAIDS are losing popularity, at least in the US, or PvP, but the PvE experience doesn't seem greatly diminished to me over all.
---
Most of the complaints are coming from harder core players. Not all,, assuredly but most. As a person who plays more casual content I'm not seeing a drop in the population.
---
Copperfed=runeforgers &gt; silverfed.
---
Silverfed is the last one you want. The other two are about equal, with runeforgers costing more but basically breaking even from the extra rune materials. Buying whichever one costs less gems (sale?) is the biggest difference to be found.
---
Mystics can easily replace silverfed unless you farm hardcore. If you run short of mystic forge stones, run some weekly key characters.
---
Ok I am just going to toss this here as the main offender of WvW being screwed:
---
**Trying to take upgraded enemy objectives is stupid.** They get up to 800 stats, extra movement speed, respawns, positioning, siege, tactics, even gliding these days.
---
The game isn't balanced around all that shit being for the defender. Thus fight commanding is dead, a relatively unorganized zerg (with WvW builds) can easily wipe a great commander that has organised group with ease. **The stronger side is supposed to be killing more than dying AND attacking.**, with the balance we have atm WvW is just dumb "open field" elitist fiesta at highest level. Doesn't help that guilds can't fight each other within objectives due to the same advantages either.
---
**Yea the firebrand/scourge/scrapper meta sucks regarding how unskilled it is** but WvW is fundamentally screwed because attacking objectives should be fun thing to do but it isn't, it sucks. As the gamemode is not fun, we have 50 people on map out of which 45 are braindead and 5 have some idea how to play the game against another same bunch because the good players that use their brains are not bothering to log in.
---
I've had two issues in my almost 2 months of playing and both were fixed within 48 hours and both addressed within 24. First was I was unable to purchase gems, second was a duplicate fem store purchase.
---
You can also level up crafting for super cheap for some quick exp, I think it is something like 10 levels if you do it right, and you can do chef for like 2 gold. Plus then you'll have tons of food to eat for the +exp boost on kills
---
Thanks, i've never even taught about possibility of different formating on old and new.
---
To power our house, of course! Asuran tech needs a lot of potato batteries to stay functioning.

Wow, thank you so much!

Wow the new website is **absolutely beautiful**!!

#Donation Time Boys

You are probably using integrated graphics. Try to disable it in bios.
---
Or idk, google other solutions.
---
Better fix that GW@Skill.net to the proper **GW2Skills.net** so people don't donate to that email address accidentally ahaha
---
Around 8k on my mesmer.. used it as a main and the only character on account. Hmh, I wasnt the smartest fella back then.
---
Thank you so much, thanks for everything over the years.
---
There are a lot more intricacies with putting builds together if you want to really optimize your dollars, so definitely have /r/buildapc look over your build for you before you finalize your build. Just mention that your build is looking for heavy single thread performance.
---
You guys do good work. I love your site.
---
The issue itself isn't the problem. They could have replied in 24 hours with "Sorry but it seems your account will never buy gems". My issue is that in 4 days I've gotten an automated response and one real response asking my name. Now nothing, not even a status update. 
---
In your example I'm sure that every customer who needed those repairs was given a full disclaimer by you up front that they would have an extended wait time due to the nature of their needs. I haven't received that. Imagine never telling the Apple customers anything, just making them wait the extended time when they only see how quickly everyone else is getting helped.
---
I say at the end of my first paragraph that integrated isn't being used. And I googled for 1.5 hours after install with no joy.
---
Dang this looks amazing! Thank you so much for all the work you put into this!
---
I completely agree with this assessment. This is something that is severely lacking atm and driving a wedge between 'casual' players and 'hardcore' players. Open world is easy and boring and does not need tutorials. However from personal experience i gathered that there are still a lot of newer players that have trouble with content from HoT and PoF and never had to think about what they do untill they enter those maps. I have been in multiple guilds that are more casual and quite some players think that PoF/HoT is hard because if you have never had to try you will get kicked in the ass by those maps. But yes Core Tyria needs more challenging encounters to phase people into those more difficult encounters.  
---
Back when they introduced the NPE I actually hoped they would add stuff like tutorials for classes/ boons/CC/line of sight/etc. Because that would make way too much sense right? :P
---
even rune of the renegade and similar runes/sigils work correct now. thats beautiful
---
Hi all, 
---
I will be building a pc and I would like some insight as to what is the most viable PC build for gw2 and any tips? 
---
I wouldn't want to spend more than $1,000 if that helps. 
---
Also, just requesting some tips on what parts to really focus on. 
---
I play a lot of WVW and I would like to have max settings with good frame rate. 
---
Thank you in advance.
---
Well, they aren't doing too bad.  I can't even reach the space bar with mine.
---
&gt;most people already have 1000s of trans shards stocked up
---
Nope.
---
I have actually been going up in karma since I made this post lol

This is a massive improvement on mobile as well- thank you!
---
My nVidia 960 FTW still works great.  I'd look for another culprit.  For example, when my quad-core gets to 80c, it hard throttles and THEN gw2 will stutter or NetFlix will stall.  If I stay below 80c, everything stays smooth. This usually only happens when multiboxing. 
---
Once I found clogged vents on the case.  Another time a heatsink clip had failed on the CPU heatsink plus the paste had dried out.  I've had the same system for 6 years except for graphic card.  i7-3770 (4 GHz turbo), 32MB Ram, ASROCK Z77 mobo.
---
\[A\] Amazing: It looks amazing.
---
\[B\] Bug: On an Engineer with Med Kit, the trait bonuses for Inventions Minor Adept and Minor Master (cleansing pulse and protection) show on the Med Kit instead of the F1 skill.
---
I had a similar problem with fullscreen running at ~30ish fps but borderless/windowed working better
---
I always thought that would make a cool world boss. Tweaked a bit ofc.
---
You think they would just up and abandon them with no mention of it?
---
There are several firebrand builds:
---
Minstrel healbrand for WvW. 
---
Harrier healbrand for raids. 
---
Harrier/minstrel (or combo) healbrand for fractals. 
---
Power quickbrand for raids (and very rarely fractals, also very good for open world). 
---
Condi firebrand for raids and fractals.
---
Condi quickbrand for ??? (Very niche build, i assume also great for open world).
---
Every build has different gear, so you need to pick one!
---
To answer your question, I've had 5 or 6 interactions with support. They were great each time. Not good, great.
---
Thanks, I'll fix this later today.
---
Since they have already implemented mount/gliding free zones, they can implement duel-free zones. 
---
These could be located around major PvE objectives, bank, trading post, crafting stations.
---
Well, in open world anything works, right? So celestial tome spammer might work too.
---
Mail it to Teapot for the ERP
---
Did it a week ago, had no bug! 
---
Keep trying, it can work!
---
Customer service experience sucks and I can sympathise but it isn't going to be applicable to the vast majority of players so I'm not sure that is useful advice.
---
Yeah. You need a massive disclaimer on that statement about end game content. My raid static pugs to fill spots and throughout the week I'll join pugs of random raid bosses and pugs for fractal CMs and T4. There is little issue with getting a group, even for content like dungeons that don't have the allure of meta relevant runes from the currency. It sounds to me like you've maybe been watching those disgruntled Arenanet partner streamers that have been stirring drama to build awareness about themselves before they move to a different game. Funnily enough, those are filtered perspectives that are biased. You shouldn't make any conclusion on the basis of that.
---
What "new player retention" do you want? Which MMO even has anything akin to that? Certainly not competitors like WoW and especially not FFXIV where you need to drag yourself through the MSQ. That's the opposite of positive player retention.
---
Hmm ... fortunately this did not happen when I had to reselect my LS3 trinkets yesterday.
---
exactly even some of the oldest most wholesome mmos that mainly focus on pve like LOTRO or EQOA have duels in them just for fun and it never ruined anybody's game experience.
---
Cthulhu is calling you home.
---
Correct! Which is why I said that the TP isn't separated between EU and NA, it's shared.
---
I see bots everywhere.
---
I had to file a support ticket yesterday. Deleted some old toons from my GW1 account, and only had mercenarely heroes with random names left. When I went to sign in later, I couldn't remember any of their names, so I couldn't sign in. I filed the support ticket, and maybe 2 hours later I was helped. They gave me a name to type in, and got me right back in.
---
I couldn't be happier with my support experience yesterday.
---
Gw2 is a game of self discovery for you as a player. Stop and think what you enjoy doing in games and you go find those things in gw2. You said you liked story? Then while you are exploring, pay attention to npc chatter and events, they are also story in this universe. Each event, each heart tells you a story of that part of the map. Some give very cool info that complements the main story as well. Is that a ruin? A ruin of what? Wtf happened here? How can I influence this area?
---
This is how I did it and I just breezed through my lvling experience.
---
You use the same logic to every other taste you might have. This was just an example.
---
 Other games hold your hand and put you through repetitive content as well, the difference is that they do it through almost obligatory quests. They treat you like a child that must be told what to do and what is good for them. Gw2 treats you like an adult. It tries to catch your attention but rarely forces you. This is the best advise I can give to you to enjoy the game as a whole.
---
just fix it asap anet wtf
---
I'm guessing you only have PoF.
---
At least I haven't had this happen on my main (both expansions), nor on my Hot only alt, but it happens on every gear I've tried on my PoF only account.
---
heck yeah
---
&gt; The “Temporary buffs” section has been updated with a number of new effects - boons, Warrior's banners, some traits and WvW buffs
---
Let me start by saying that I really really really like this. You just made my life so much simpler.
---
I found a small bug, if you put banners in your skill bars you cannot deselect the corresponding temporary effect. Moreover, before last update of 5 minutes ago I had the wrong stats displayed (I noticed I was missing some precision), that I fixed by unequipping banners and deactivating / reactivating the temporary effect. I don't remember how much was the difference but I speculate I was only getting 100 precision instead of 200 from double standards. It's also possibly due to having activated the effect before choosing the build.
---
Finally, I have a feature request: could you add effective hp and effective power in the summary? It would really help with optimizing gear (and not having to compute it by hand every time). Effective hp is defense * hp, effective power is power * (1 + critical chance * critical bonus), with critical bonus = critical multiplier - 1 (e.g. for 250% the multiplier is 2.5 and the bonus is 1.5).

If openworld is all that you care about, you will be fine pretty much until game closes completely.
---
This is a way better idea
---
Well you can use discord without using the voice chat, and if a microphone is the problem you can at least listen to other guild members
---
Why would it be a scam? What does anet gain from taking gold?

As someone who's been playing FFXIV for 4 years and has grown to really dislike their devs: You're not going to find salvation there.

I farmed 21 transmutation crystal in wvw. And I know I can change skin. But when I will boring with exact same look, I want to change it sometime. So I will need more crystals for each time I want to change my gear (while it is exotic and not legendary etc).
---
Am I right?
---
In eso its cheaper, easier, you can change outfits for free, you can change parts for small gold count, while you have millions or more.
---
That's pretty dissapointed.
---
What I want is not to impress. My problem in eso I have like 20 outfits with different color, also my gear have own style, so when I feel boring of how my character loooks I just switch for free.
---
Can I do here same? I guess not ecause all will costs 1 transmutation crystal for each part. And outfits costs real money. 
---
Thanks. I don't know what the hell happened. I won't even pretend I was on my phone. Just a 100% brain-fingers failure.

You can probably just join one and explain that.
---
Worth noting though, Discord is more useful than just voicechat so I'd still recommend joining even if you don't plan to go in the voice channels.
---
Being able to make things look realistically crappy on purpose is a special skill.
---
ui is soooo much prettier, but i don't like putting weapon selection or the copy-all buttons behind popups.
---
&gt; I can't use Discord.
---
Unless you're hearing impaired or your computer lacks a headphone jack, you can use Discord. 99% of guilds don't care if you never speak. They want you listening during events and they want you chatting about builds, tactics, etc.
---
YES! I can view the trait info while on mobile again!  
---
Thank you!
---
Thats for your work for all these years, doesn't happen often for a fan project
---
 Tequatl the Sunless. I was today on this event world boss. At least 15+ people from guild mentioned that they have huge lag, and 10+ from map chat too. They also said it's liek for last week or more.

---
I have 3,000h on my ele and 1,000h on my engie.
---
The rest of my toons share the rest 500h of my 4,500h total.
---
There is too much gold in the circulation and they're trying to artificially increase the price of legendary runes? Why would you add a mat sink (AGAIN) for material that is needed for legendary runes. In fact 30k lucent mtoes for full set of runes. And you get nothing in return if you gamble. It will never pay off.
---
The best way to look at that is as a chance to see the story of multiple races at once.  The Charr accompanying the Human in Queensdale for story there won't progress his story, but he still gets to see the start of the Human story.  Then the Human comes with the Charr to Plains of Ashford and gets to watch the Charr story as he progresses there.  It takes more time, but it's more bang for your buck overall with story content.
---
As mentioned elsewhere, at higher levels your stories can merge together and you'll earn progress at the same time, depending on your choices.
---
Gwen would be all for the Ebonhawke Treaty, she was happy to work with Pyre Fierceshot after all. She knew that the Flame Legion ultimately was responsible for all the trouble and wasn't solely driven by her rage. She would be upset at the Separatists / Renegades though and would probably want to wipe them out. I'd imagine she would find Logan underwhelming, but not a total disappointment.
---
Did this last month, had no issues. Some of them are a little weird though, double check the wiki on ones you're having trouble with and make sure you're not doing something slightly wrong.
---
Which comes to the present from the past which is also the future but from another world's video game that's *actually* a real universe.
---
Hmm not as high as I thought but a lot is from AFK anyway
---
Some networks may block the usage of Discord as well. I've met many college students where Discord is blocked on the campus network.
---
How do you know the problem lies with AMD and not GW2? If anything AMD’s drivers over the last couple of years have been on point, especially when compared to NVidia drivers. But point is, the performance of a game is dependent on both sides, the GPU company’s driver set and the game developers implementation/optimization.
---
i join both and from personal experience, the 's parties are usually full of dumbos/bad players thinking they're good etc.
---
Bought 50 keys yesterday. 25 keys, opened the chests, 25 keys more.  
---
First set of keys I got 5 uncommons. 2 Black Lion Tickets, 2 Soaring weapons, and the Mount.
---
Second set of keys I got 1 uncommon. Fireworks backpack and glider.
---
If it is going to be something short of new elite specs and a lot of repeatable challenging content, I would expect last daily logging palyers to bail out. Not leave and uninstall instantly, but to drop any hopes and consistent schedule. And  after that it is only a matter of time. 
---
Even then, whatever they promise will be released over a year, and game needs it ~~now~~ months ago.
---
Awesome! Thanks for your work on this.
---
Apparently it's a known issue that DX9 games haven't been playing well on AMD GPUs, be it hearsay or fact I'm not sure. I got this fix from the Borderlands 2 subreddit and that was the conclusion they came to. Initially I did get the problem to go away a while ago after a Windows and Radeon driver update but it came back after another Radeon driver update. Not sure at this point what the problem is but DX9 is old and new hardware probably isn't being made and designed in mind for that API.
---
Always had incredible support, even with problems I caused.
---
I had the same exact issue and they fixed it within a couple of days.  Are you sure you submitted your ticket correctly?
---
Who says there is a big reveal?
---
Discord has text channels as well, it's not just about voice chat.
---
Besides, you'll never hear 20 people talk at the same time. I had the same idea, but it's far from that. You don't know until you try.
---
**Ooooh, shiny!** **This is new.** **That was impressive!** **I Like It.**  **Just one more confirmation of how great** *You Are*!
---
None. You can't mix and match exotic and legendary runes for combined bonus.
---
when choosing for example reaper, the underwater has spear and trident automatically, but can't change them if i want to set 2x spear for example
---
Whoa so many legendaries
---
To think that my picture will become a meme template...
---
What a time to be alive!
---
This is best MMORPG out there, even though I don't play anymore, because of time I sunk in it on daily basis, I say it's an awesome game and very friendly encouraging people to work together rather than against each other. But in case you don't WvW is the best place to be to have fun with your favorite people. God damn I miss this game so much!
---
I recall them saying that they’re done destroying it during some sort of Q&amp;A from years ago. Ocean Fun land is here to stay for a long time.
---
Like.. tsunami flooding from Selbbub?
---
I'd rather see a time rift open up to Old LA. They could even bridge the gap with new players by making them zone into Old LA during the account's first playthrough of the personal story and before starting HoT.
---
Casually hanging out in wvw for most of your time doesn't earn any weight to your opinion on what's killing the game mode, sorry
---
If they destroy it a third time, people will keep demanding  for it to burn until their personal preferences are matched while others will grieve over more and more incarnations that they genuinely liked. 
---
They might as well throw their money out of a window.
---
Power cycle your router.
---
No
---
Thank you so so much for you effort &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I'm not sure why you think celestial isn't good for pve.  I've been using celestial to great effect in pve, on multiple classes, for years now.  It's also good for WvW.
---
I have tried it, and I use voice chat every day. I still dislike the guilds that put all their communications in discord leaving the in game chat completely empty of any conversation.
---
And yes, I have had many times where 20 people try to talk at once. When you have 50 people in a voice channel and it is not a strictly organized event the voice chat becomes all but unusable. When it comes to discord having chat channels, alt+tabbing every time I need to read the chat or type something is far from convenient. 
---
The in game chat is just so much more effective for casual conversation in my opinion. But, to each their own, nothing wrong with it if you are one that prefers Discord:)
---
Some comments below directed you to trying D9VK. My setup is below and I used the following video to help me through it:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B4rYPjzOPg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B4rYPjzOPg)
---
I'm using the 5700 XT, 19.7.3 drivers and on Windows 10 Pro. Have been suffering severe stuttering and simply couldn't play. After trying out D9VK in Windows, I'm getting a solid 60fps so I'd highly recommend it!
---
D9VK download link I used: [https://git.froggi.es/joshua/d9vk/-/jobs](https://git.froggi.es/joshua/d9vk/-/jobs)
---
I actually agree. I don't think I deserve the awards since I had NO characters for a while but I've had the game for 2-3 years. I made a few charas, hated it, and quit playing after deleting them. Then one day (about a year ago) I started new and loved it, so even though I made my account 2-3 years ago and began playing, I won't get any rewards except the 1 yr birthday. 
---
It's kinda silly 
---
Are the pieces of armor only per character ? Can you use the skin as an unlocked wardrobe transmog or?
---
Buy character slots.
---
The amount of work they'll have to do to make a new race is phenomenal. I highly doubt it.
---
These once-per-account birthday rewards should be based off of account age. I think the only reason they are based off of character age is that they already had a system for birthday rewards based on that. It was easy for them to tack the account birthday rewards on to that existing system. For the first many years of this game there was only character birthday rewards.
---
So it's not that ANet thinks the current way is the right way, or they chose to snub people who have deleted their characters. It's just that it's probably takes more work than you would think to make the rewards based on account age. Since the current system is fine for the vast vast majority of players, they have decided it's not worth putting the work in to change it.
---
I feel personally accused by that
---
Absolutely zero percent chance. ANet has been very clear that they are not going to add more races to the game.
---
Emm never say never. I highly doubt but I also never thought we'd get mounts, raids or a new class. Although this is between 5-10% so very low I'd never say it'll never happen.
---
at the end of season 5 a portal will open up to the endgame idea they have for gw2 after the story is complete, and as we lift off in an asuran charr hybrid airship we look down on lions arch to see the picture with the giant dragon heads finally happen and lions arch is destroyed by the water dragon as we leave the old tyria for the new one
---
The strategy of changing existing maps for living worth didn't really pay off for them in season 1.
---
I think we all understood that the forge event was a material sink, same as we all understand that the Zephyrite Supply Boxes are a material sink.  Is it a wise use of your materials?  No.  But calling it a scam is a stretch.
---
You joke, but this is exactly what we did for Pink Day (Breast Cancer Awareness) in Lion's Arch last year. It was a ton of fun and we raised a bunch of money for charity!
---
Players shouldn't be forced to purchase more slots for anniversary rewards. Especially considering there were those of us playing at a time when we had to pay for the game.
---
The Status is checked on every wvw reset and not in realtime

I still have 51 celebration boosters from that one time they gave out a bunch for a community achievement last year.

It has opened. Your best option is to transfer to BGs current link server (which is currently Kaineng). "These (links) currently change every 2 months on the last Friday of every even numbered month." So you'll have to transfer to BG's new link every 2 months (next one will be Aug. 30th), at least until BG opens.

---
&gt; Can you use the skin as an unlocked wardrobe transmog ? 
---
Of course. The unlock in the wardrobe just like any other skin.
---
At the time of the release of the game, I had no idea there would be anniversary rewards. I also feel like players such as myself, who have a need to cycle through classes and races before coming down to a decision, shouldn't be forced to use personal money (buying slots) in order to keep a character up just for rewards. Looking back yes, there were ways I could have kept at least one character up from then until now. But at that time, I wasn't thinking about rewards I didn't know existed. Ya know?

or slightly modifying existing voicelines with a filter and then using the new voice actors from then on

Literally unselectable.

Jokes aside, I had to edit my own prevoous comment twice due to typos (thank god it was all under the 2 minute threshold) as I'm on mobile too 😅
---
Looks like this is the way to go for these new Navi cards. I'm glad it's running good for you now!
---
I'm guessing it looks and functions so crappily because it's built from the same code as things like the upgrade extraction UI. I suspect (or at least hope) they released it 'as is' while working on a more heavy-duty UI update (see: build templates) that will replace this ugly, awkward and bug-ridden interface with something cleaner. Hope I'm not being too optimistic on this one.
---
Can't spam AoE if your permastunned.
---
Also not scourge in particular no, Necromancer.

Mesmer doesn't need CI. It's fine without it.
---
And then throw it at them.
---
I've heard some people have had luck getting support to restore old deleted characters, which yes requires an open character slot and you have to remember the name, and it's not a guarantee they can find it yada yada yada. Might be worth it though, the birthday dye kits get pretty nice as time goes on, as I think restored toons maintain original age/creation date?
---
How does it improve gameplay? Races luckily don't have any forced differences except cosmetic, so how would a new race contribute to gameplay in any way?
---
I checked on this on my support ticket, and yes they can restore characters. But, through the period of deletion they don't maintain their age. So it's of no use Unfortunately.
---
&gt;  it feels like a slap in the face from Anet, that they don't care about the player(s).
---
are you even for real man? "slap in the face", "dont care about the players" because of a fucking birthday gift? holy shit. overexaggerating much?
---
So, with all the Mesmer nerfs in a row, is ANet going to let me re-spec my mesmer main as an Elementalist? 
---
Cause I'm not deleting my oldest character with 100% map complete to be able to play a not gimped character.
---
gotta appreciate the random doomsaying.
---
It will get destroyed in season 5, and then the ruins will get destroyed in season 6.  They rebuild it in season 7 and demolish it because they hated the new new design.  Season 8 is about coming up with the perfect design for lions arch.  Gets destroyed again in season 9.  Season 10 is a time travel arc that brings back the original LA.
---
Or you could stop being a lil bandwagon riding shitter and go somewhere else. Just a thought.
---
There's nothing wrong with people wanting to play with experienced players, but this is exactly why raids are dead in NA. Why would I bother joining a specific guild, doing research on YouTube, and making a scheduled time commitment for a game mode I'm not sure I even enjoy? I say this as someone who actually has gone through the trouble and got a handful of kills on most of the HoT raids. It's just not a sustainable model

IMO guild wars has never been a game that I worry about if my pc can handle it and my hardware was top of the line maybe 4ish years ago. For instance I have a gpu that slightly outperforms a gtx 1070 so it’s no where near a top card nowadays. 
---
If you are worried when it comes to having a strong enough rig to run games at a high graphical fidelity you need to prioritize the GPU (aka graphics card) as well as the RAM and a solid processor. I usually splurge on my GPU as the most expensive part in my rig.  If you have $1,000 for a pc you are going to be more than okay, however, if you want more bang for your buck I’d wait for Black Friday and cyber Monday this year and make sure to lurk on 
---
r/buildapcsales  they have deals everyday. 
---
A few resources I use when making a pc for myself or a friend is pcpartpicker.com as it’ll tell you if your components are compatible and optimal (ex: running an amd card and processor is optimal, while running powerful components with a weak power supply is not compatible.) 
---
Good luck and if you have any more questions feel free to PM me
---
Absolutely I'm for real. I've been supporting Anet since 2005. I purchased all the original GW games/expansions. I had to purchase GW2 because at the time of release it wasn't free to play. I've purchased both HoT and PoF. I've put money into the Gem Store. I've put 7 years into playing this (GW2) game, supporting it what little ways I can. And Anet won't give some players the time of day in regards to a reward system that they qualify for via the age on their account, but because their *character* age doesn't match it, they refuse to help them. I understand if this is just something **you** do when you come home for a hour or two, but for some of us who have been there since the beginning, for 12 years now, it's more than that. And I feel let down by Anet that they won't help me or other players in this same situation.
---
Well you could allways defeat mirages as well. If op means undefeatable to you then nothing would be op.
---
Awwww, that sucks :(
---
Almost halfway thru it, I just wish I didn't sell all those amalgamated gemstones during my years of playing...
---
Thanks for trying to help though!
---
first half is good. second part is pretty boring.

Don't let the legends scare you, the Ancient Land of the Elitists is a place of colossal damage numbers, infinite boons, and copious amounts of gold, where the Leeches are banished from and only those who show the will to learn share the riches of the Loot.

Some Skritts from Anet.
---
 Here is the response from Anet:  
---
While I'd love for that to be a solution, and we are happy to do that for you, I must inform you that a character's birthday/age is not tracked while deleted. As a result, if we were to restore the character, the new birth date of the character would match the date of its restoration.  
---
We're still happy to restore the character for you - I just suspect that you wouldn't get the result you were looking for. Please ask if there's anything else you'd like or need from us.  
---

---
Yeah, I should have added a smiley or a /s, my fault not yours!
---
Well, if you're constantly trying to change looks, then yea, unfortunately GW2 will need you to do some work on farming trans charges. I do also agree about stats changing because it's basically a legendary function (no boost in stats as it's literally the same as ascended). 
---
I do have to disagree about the real money part since you can just convert gold to gems. This is a game you don't need to spend real money if you don't want to. (And like I said, once you're at our stages, farming like 400 gems is no biggie). 
---
Is it gold focus? I guess you can say that. Is it greedy? I don't think so since you can grab skins for gold so real money is not the only way to get it. 
---
Then again, if you dislike spending 1-2 hours a day doing things that generate gold (so you can buy gems or whatever), but very focus on skins changing, then yea, this game might not be for you. 
---
I'm just a dude who loves a final look and will not change anything until new skins come out. (Still won't change it if I don't like it ofc) 
---
Hope this helps.
---
It has another purpose?
---
Look for achievements in Hero panel.
---
-
---
I like collections, Pets, Chairs, Bugs Terminators, Bosses group fights....that kind of stuff. Never in PvP, WvW that kind of stuff.
---
Still have other MMORPG(s) in my HD, but have not touched them for a while, since I found out the GW2 Achievements panel.
---
Alright, I will try that then, thanks!
---
Thanks but, I know what I need for predator and it's mostly boatloads of gold. And leveling crafting wasn't too terribly difficult for huntsman, I just might not have been very efficient.
---
Don't be so quick to say it's not for them.  This is the same thing I went through when I first started playing.  It took three tries at the game and then it finally "clicked" once I started to understand the world/lore and reached beyond the core game.
---
Have you ever played PvE dude, in what world is core engi considerbly worse than holo. Please dont tell thr new player to go core ele in 2019
---
Round - well, oval - *zero*. I've more hope for Cube World development than for GW2's.
---
It starts on the bridge. Follow the bird poop and the chimneys to find the path.
---
awesome! I didn't know that... damn and Tool's new album is coming out the same day. That day is already a good one!
---
I bought GW2 at launch because the original GW was my first online game and I was kind of sentimental about it, but I ended up quitting it pretty early because none of my old guild buddies were still playing. Any advice if I wanted to come back and start from scratch?
---
Aha! I didn't see that one pass by, thanks!

I presume you checked those prices from trading post’s ”skins” tab? Yes, they are expensive as they are mostly just drops from black lion chests!  But there is a far more cheaper way which for example i use. You can unlock skins by binding or salvaging weapons and armour. So, go to trading post, weapons section, choose the weapon type (ie. sword) and to make it easier click the little cog icon and select ”level range 80-80” and ”rarity: exotic”. Choosing those will display more unique skins as most of them are lvl. 80 exotic. You should also sort the items from lowest to highest price to clarify things. Then just pick a weapon which skin you like,  buy it and eighter salvage it or soul bind it to unlock the akin. Then you can apply it to any weapon you have by pressing H and choosing wardrobe. It uses one transmutation charge per change and you get those by playing the game or buying them for cash. You get plenty of them by playing the game as for example i haven’t had a need to buy them at all during my years of playing.
---
Oh and what does binding mean? Well, items can be account bound, soul bound pr not bound at all. Account bound items can be swapped between your characters, soul bound are bound to the character who got them and items that are not bound can be freely sold at trading post.
---
Outfits can mostly be bought with cash (diamonds). You earn some through festivals though. But most players don’t use them as it is easier to get the looks you want by transmuting your gear or getting the armour pieces with looks you like. Outfit is one item which covers ALL your existing armour pieces and has 4 dye channels. Ehich is very limiting. Compare that to normal armour which has 1-4 dye channels per piece (armour= 6 pieces). Plus with armour you can mix and match but not with outfits.
---
because the 23k DPS is with perfect execution, I assume you don't have perfect execution
---
If you think GW2's ranger is unique, try TERA's Archer - it's unique, but not in a good way.
---
It's a ranged, *magic* class ***that deals the most damage UP CLOSE***. What the fuck were they thinking?! This is so counter intuitive.
---
please don't even say that, 8k is only acceptable on bosses that have a LOT of immunity phases or mechanics(like Twilight Oasis) and even then 8k isn't really good.
---
Huh, not as impressive as I anticipated.

Marauder will be great for open world PVE and story , and "good enough" for fractals and WvW.
---
I personally run zerker and have some marauder trinks I add for WvW. I sometimes stat swap my legendary weapons to diviners, but doesnt matter too much.

I need to do that, I have way too many scrolls I can't bring myself to pitch, but I also have close to a thousand tomes I insist on hoarding, like what if I all of a sudden need 10 new level 80s &gt;:(

Yes now I understand. But the other point was about in eso I can have 2 saved skin setups which I can change for ZERO gold anytime and 10-20-30 or more outfits also which can be turn on for free again and cover my skin armor, so it's good when you are boring of how your character looks like. So gw2 system is very greedy. 
---
I'm not talking about expensive effects now, but it is very boring if you need to spend time to farm some crystals to change your armor and then like no go back until new farm. .

My dude, If you plan to use the same armor set for all contents you will just gimp yourself and whoever your playing with, of your not a minstrel fb in wvw your probably gonna die alot if your not a very exp player. If your not full berserker power fb in fractals you will have shit dps unless you play heal fb and have full harriers which is the designated healer and is a good build, other than that you will be getting carried if you use any other build. As far as open world pve goes, no1 cares what you use, it's too easy that you can use whatever you want.
---
I bet he can't wait for it to be *even more* with classic WoW. Might reach the giddy highs of 400!

The voice of Rytlock Brimstone, Justiciar Hablion in GW1, Pyre Fierceshot, the GW1 male PC, and dozens of other NPCs throughout the series, knows doesn't know anything about Guild Wars.
---
I somehow doubt that. He may not play the game or be invested in it, but he's been playing roles for the franchise since the very first release. He's bound to know plenty about it and the characters he's played.

&gt;Gregory James Miller[1] (born April 27, 1983) is an Internet personality and former editor and video host of the entertainment website IGN.
---
I would rather hear something about the contents of that announcement instead.

Gaming journalist, Youtube Let's Play guy, works for Kinda Funny, semi-aligned with Rooster Teeth, pro wrestling afficionado, hangs around on Reddit as /u/GameOverGreggy and sometimes weighs in on random threads about him.

With harrier healbrand: Tome 1 skill 4 for fire field, drop kit -&gt; staff 2 (blast finisher for might) -&gt; staff 4 -&gt; use 2 charges of the mantra that grants might (not logged in, it's not the healing one). That should let you pre-buff 25 stacks before using the mistlock singularity to reset everything, then you can do it again for a really long duration if needed.
---
&gt; While LS1 killed the game, HoT saved the game. And while PoF killed the game again, it's possible LS5 might save the game again.
---
Holy exaggeration Batman
---
CAAAANTAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
---
sometimes when people encounter this big a difference in benchmarks is usually because they forgot to set up something on the golem.
---
did you make sure to give yourself quickness,25might and fury? put 25 vuln on the golem? golem size can also affect skills like citadel bombardment
---
8k is good for alac rev, bad for pure dps classes. Usually see pug revs at 4k.
---
HoT saved the game? In what world? Until LS3 showed up there was more doomsay than there is now. There was nothing to to after you ran through HoT content, and we weren't sitting on the amount of reworks we have now. The game isn't in a good spot right now but in no way I would want to go back to the shit show that was HoT - LS3
---
And every diving spot ever.
---
depends on the boss
---
It could only  be better if the stat icons were the actual symbol in inscriptions/insignia, like a dragon head for Berserker's/Zojja instead an axe.
---
For once, I really liked it! Good job there!
---
For me the fix would be having an in-game ABC music player like LotRO and Starbound with the instruments you've unlocked as novelties, while still allowing manual freeplay with skills.
---
Grieving would probably be the best considering that dps is just a few K lower than viper, but the burst is still very high.
---
If you're picking gear specifically for fractals, why not go full power and skip the condi entirely?
---
I dunno why this reminded me of Silent Hill 2 and Mary's letter.
---
I mean, totally unrelated, but I was reminded.

---
I actually don't understand why it happened, but I have a relatively good idea: Outfits themselves are pinned to a chest-piece armor slot, and with ladies, that counts as their bra when armor is hidden, which happens under the outfit itself. With males, when you switch menus, it's just the same dyes as your coat-piece, rather than what's on your outfit. I believe this is how they keep it rendered properly and why this sort of thing happened, but sadly, rather than finding it intriguing they'll just call me a big ol' perv. But ah well. I found it interesting, and I was thoughtful to share, before I probably delete the post because I forgot how the internet is (somehow).
---
I forgot that the jump macro was a thing.
---
Yes. Want.
---
So they'd actually have to work for their money, what a wild concept huh..
---
Maybe "sorry but it seems your account will never buy gems" isn't the response they're going to give you. Like the person above said -- they can only move as fast as Digital River moves, if indeed that's the problem. Maybe they don't HAVE an answer to give you yet, so what do you want them to say to you?
---
I understand an update might be nice, but remember that it's just now Monday. You can only expect so much over days that aren't considered business days -- and they're rightly wary of just sending you meaningless "update" emails to things they can't give an answer to or an ETA on, because people do get upset about those and start saying customer service is just putting them off, etc. Or people start to get false hope and then get even angrier if the ultimate response is "we're sorry, we can't fix this".
---
Every experience I've ever had with customer service has been great, and nearly every experience I've ever heard other people talk about has been great. They already sent you one email, even if it was just asking your name, so you know they're at least working on it. Chill out.
---
From when I used to listen to KF's stuff, no he doesn't play, and he's not a PC gamer by any means. He IS an entertainer though, and is fine to give it his best that way. His old GF used to play quite a lot, and he would joke about it in the podcasts, so he's at least... been around it a bit?
---
Size is same if you have base game or the 2 expacs. Cliente download all data with both expacs even if you dont have them. Then game blocks access to what you dont have unlocked. Just makes diference if you have more then 1 language. More languages you have more space it uses.
---
Yes I am toxic asshole that played to much of EVE-Online back in the day. I killed defenseless people in group of 20 people. I was bait for fat strategic targets. I solo killed mining operations of 10+ accounts. I suicide killed noobs just for fun. I pirated people for ransom and then when I received it I killed them anyway. 
---
At the same time I wiped whole fleet of 30 people due to my bad scouting once. It was my responsibility and people blamed me with strait insults. Nevertheless when my corporation was making stand of  100 battleships against mixed fleet of 1000 people, I proudly fought to the end and we won. I improved every time I loaded into game.
---
Competitive gaming have a lot of fun to people that want to improve. But once you start neglect strait PvP aspects of gamemode you have clasterfuckingclounfiesta GW2 become. Warclaw was a mistake. I do not want discuss really bad timing of release, because it have huge glaring issue actually making server performance in competitive gamemode worse. And it made rather arcady gamemode even more of a joke with people suicide contesting keep rings for an hour in some cases.
---
Class balance is awful. Scourge is most braindead experience that I ever had in competitive gamemode ever. Scrapper is total bullshit and was made so intentionally to somewhat counter Scourge, and it is such bad gameplay experience that I barely played it 2 evenings (unlike WvW guardian that have 900h+).
---
Reward balance is awful. Most efficient way to play gamemode is to repair walls of SM every 5 minutes. Literally every time when I see t3 SM there is 30+ people doing this shit and not participating in anything.
---
WvW Matchmaking... well it is fucking dead. Awful system that destroyed most of the server identities and only serves purpose of filling Anet pockets.

He's a fan of service games and MMO titles (The Division 1/2, Destiny 1/2, DC Universe Online are the three he talks about the most), but he only plays these games if they're on consoles. At the very least, he's knowledgeable of the genre, and is about as much of a casual-core gamer as you can get.
---
If GW2 ever had console release, he might have dabbled with it at that point in time and liked it, but that's not what happened in this timeline.
---
And yet one of the most asked for to be re released on both forums and reddit. I was there when it was out and i would not call int low quallity stuff. The nightmare tower, the full special dungeon, the twisted marionettes, the destruction of LA, the war in la and the termination of scarlet and the boss fight before that. All of those where very high quallity content that so many people have never seen. 
---
I would add the Karka event but due to the lag issue that happen then it was not so fun as it should have been, but that is something mega servers would fix now.
---
I would love for this to come again in any shape, does not have to be seasons that was just me wishfully thinking it.

I just watched 2 interviews he did with Chris Whiteside in February 2013 and Mike Z in August 2013 and he asked good questions and listened as well as joked with the guests. I'll think he'll do fine like the same role as Jennifer Hale at the HoT announcement.

Pets don't usually matter open world, but maybe a wolf for regen. For Damage, pick up maybe an XXX - Main Hand, and Axe - Offhand, MH is whatever you want, Axe 5 is pretty good for damage.

---
9/10, no shaman solo.
---
I understand, I think it is fine is someone wants to build for PVP and happens to be a dueler as well, this game is so easy that a PVP build would not really hurt your leveling process at all in the open world as pretty much any build is viable for casual leveling.

Yeap, you're right - I've just checked this at PvP screen. Thanks for pointing - I'll fix this problem with next update.

Yeah Anet announce the content before the announcement lets all boycott GW2 till they do this I'm behind you dude.
---
Announce the contents of the announcement before the announcement so people watch the announcement and go "what was the point of this announcement?! They already announced everything they announced!"
---
My bad then, I stand corrected!
---
We're getting EA shills to host announcements now?
---
Xiuquatl mostly because I'm a huge fan of green.  So its won my heart in that aspect.  Plus I think the glow/footfalls is a little less intense as some of the other auras (I should be done crafting it next month I hope, just waiting on MC/gemstones at this point -- took me 7 years to decide I probably should make one).
---
Ipos is a close second though.  Just being a floaty magical book is fun.
---
It's one of those 'so bad it's good' moments in marketing history. Better than the original ad with the riot police and the people covered in dirt anyway, that was just frickin' weird.
---
You don't need a Kasmeer goodie bag to be interesting, just be yourself and don't worry about it :3

[The recent Mystic Forge events only had two unlocked skins so far, but lots are still locked.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_secrets)

Exotic Staff + Ectoplasmic Stone + 250 Elder Wood Plank + Anthology of Heroes is a recipe that shows up in the forge but gets rejected at the moment. It will likely spit out [The Forest King](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Forest_King).

Based off of the various "behind the voice" videos that ArenaNet has done, the major voice actors do know a bit about their characters - at least enough to make such commentary about how they play the role - and Steve Blum was among them. ArenaNet devs also have made several comments and discussions about how they do give the voice actors directions and not just a sheet of paper to read off of.
---
Unless all of that is more than a bit of a lie, then I think when it comes to voicing, ArenaNet (at least as of Season 2?) is further than most video game companies.
---
Not feelings, Facts.
---
Pharus, Blinding of Ipos, Xiuquatl, Flames of War and Verdarach.
---
If i had to craft a t2 it would be astralaria, and maybe pharus
---
It's part of the yet to be unlocked Mystic Forge recipie for a new staff.  
---
I noticed it back in June.
---
They all follow a similar pattern.  
---
 
---
* 1 Exotic Weapon (I had a [Sunscythe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunscythe) handy)
---
* 1 Ecotplasmic Stone
---
* 1 Anthology of Heroes
---
* 250 Refined Material (in this case Elder Wood Planks)

Eh, he's high energy and a bit cornball, but I feel like this is way overblown. If you're cringing the whole way when he's hosting things, you've got a pretty low bar.
---
Sunrise or Incinerator.
---
Remember that they had far more people back then.
---
Who
---
in the blue hell
---
is Greg Miller?
---
Apparently a lot of people, judging from the number of comments. Wish you were here.
---
Easiest way to do the hearts in Season 4 episode one Pirate heart?
---
"Maintain Peace and Order in the Corsair flotilla" trying to complete it as fast as possible for the stellar weapons/Visions of Istan Astral weapons, But so far finding drunk pirates is slow and tiresome...
---
You can be smart and entertaining. You can even be smart, American and entertaining. Carl Sagan comes to mind.
---
Jesus Christ people. It's Greg Miller not Kanye West. They aren't paying top dollar for him and he's a perfectly fine host. He did well in the past covering GW2 and there's no reason to think this time will be any different.
---
Clearly ArenaNet are trying to generate more hype for Season 5 than any other season and presumably they have a reason for that. More hype for the game is only good for everyone at this point.
---
You're just looking for reasons to be pissy.
