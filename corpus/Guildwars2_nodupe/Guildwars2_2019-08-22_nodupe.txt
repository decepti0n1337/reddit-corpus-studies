HAHAHAHAH semp! long time!

---
I worked my way through FFXIV on new characters about 3 separate times, one for each release (ARR, and then the two following expansions.) 
---

---
My first time around I played mainly DPS, dungeon waits did take like an hour but there was so much to do while I waited, that didn’t interrupt the queue, that it was really a non-issue. I never felt like I was just standing still waiting, I could work on leveling other classes and crafts, I could continue side questing or even main questing up to a point. I could do fates and such, I could garner mats. 
---
My second time through I mainly played healer, queues were about 15 minutes average, my queues popped so fast that it felt more practical to just stand still and wait. We also had just gotten the Golden Saucer, so often times I would just gamble while I waited.
---
My third time around I played mainly tank. Queues as a tank were literally instant, there was almost never a wait. Queues popped so fast that I would often have to take a break from instanced content so that I wouldn’t be so overleveled all the time.
---
I thought they shut down the servers
---
I fed some to a [cat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lady_Wisteria_Whiskington).  She seemed ok ... ish.

SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN A JOB IN ANET!
---
its funny that you got downvoted so much as you are telling the truth. People here are so desperate for expansion that they dont want to hear this truth.. Oh they will be so dissapointed on 30th man.
---
Amazing work!
---
I wanna be half as good as you guys are!
---
Brace for downvotes, that picture someone posted of their lv12 is getting more traction. Game is in a good state :smile:
---
Damn. Proud of you prud, keep it up!
---
How?
---
GvGs and the guilds that did it.
---
thanks mom!
---
As a guard main you don't really know guard.
---
I wouldn't advise you to actually expect elite specs during the announcement. If you pay attention they've been seriously cautious to not overhype this announcement by just giving reminders of it and not going all "BIG SHIT IS COMING" type of reminders. 
---
Since its gonna be a 45min presentation I think they will most likely talk about the journey of the previous season along with the story and give us a few hints and teases of what's to come with the new season, likely we'll get sneak peeks at a few new systems or probably even gameplay/mechanic changes with a few glimpses of gameplay of stuff they've been working on that we know nothing about (wvw alliances?) along with some sort of roadmap about what to expect during the runtime of the season.
---
Probably closing in with saying that S5 would probably end right into an expansion similarly like S3 ending tied right into PoF within a few months (best case scenario).
---
&gt; Giving everything the same rewards is a great way to ensure most people won't even try the higher difficulties.
---
Most people already don't do that. GW2 Raid content is so little played it might as well not even exist to the general playerbase.
---
The perfect 7th year anniversary would be [Human Monk Buns](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/d/db/Monks.jpg).  Please Anet, it's all I've actually wanted.
---
Mm im in the same boat, though some people are willing I guess.
---
As they say: Opinions are like assholes and you just dumped a pile of poo.
---
just to clarify the title a little [https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The\_Guild\_Wars](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Guild_Wars)
---
although there was a GvG mode in the original Guild wars game, it was replaced with WvW as GvG didn't really draw that much attention
---
so lets say we get balthazar fight fractal (would be cool), but then you have design philosophy problem of people playing a fractal before finishing their story etc.
---
best solution would be new dungeon each living story map, unlocked after completing the story (account unlock). rewards unique skins, currency, loot, long term rewards like gizmos/effects.
---
and it's a LS locked episode so it wouldn't be exactly F2P (i assume anet doesnt support dungeons because the core game went f2p, they even had to lock fotm rewards behind masteries)
---
The other community events seem to have had some issues as well.  Feels like they are tweaking the system each time.  I'm sure it's not easy to test outside of the live environment, plus spaghetti code doesn't help.
---
Hopefully they use these minor events to work out the kinks before using it for something major.
---
The issue is they have to test on the Dev environment which is not 100% the same as the live environment. So as a result this most likely didn't show up in the Dev environment.
---
Jesus Christ I was not expecting the ending. I had my volume turned up to hear what he was saying and I damn near pissed myself! Great project though good luck it looks awesome!
---
I *really* wanted to see the progress over this next week. I feel like this is the worst of the bonus events and I have a feeling the tracker would've reflected that.
---
Interesting. I wonder if these events are actually here to test some game-wide events for Season 5, like happened with those Mordrem invasions pre-HoT.
---
Fucking final fantasy 14 does that shit and its amazing, its it really so hard to do that for the lw bosses?
---
:)
---
This event doesn't feel very "community" like anyway. Selfish Rambos taking out champs asap is one such issue I saw. No real organization unless someone takes initiative on a map.
---
Looks amazing!
---
What does “don’t you guys have phones?” Mean?
---
&gt; Why ANET isn't ignoring them and giving the greenlight to double living story into dungeons/raids, I'll never know why.
---
Sad truth is.. Well.. Watch a random Anet stream, see their builds and how they play. They ARE the casuals. On top of that, they expect majority of the playerbase being the same, if not worse. They're freaking scared of a tiniest bit of challenge.
---
Who fractals on NA smh
---
EU EU EU
---
I mean pugs are like surprise mechanics. Its totally random what you're gonna get.
---
even post nerfs HoT can still fuck you up if you aren't smart. Mounts are what really killed open world difficulty
---
I got a refractor from my first free box. One hell of a way to entice me to keep going.
---
Elementalist isn't that skill-intensive, it's just got a lot of spells to use. You need to know what all of them are in each attunement, so you know what buttons to press immediately after swapping. Elementalist is also squishy, but I mainly play support Tempest that poops out protection non-stop, so I don't have that much experience playing totally glass canon. Arcane Shield is a very strong utility to help you with survival, though. Weaver has a lot of access to barrier which helps it survive. 
---
Engineer is only difficult if you use a lot of kits. Holosmith is pretty simple. It's also very overpowered, so that also makes it quite comfortable to play. That said, kits are quite cool and very useful for all kinds of engineer builds, so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with most of them. Playing with kits is similar to playing Elementalist in that you need to know what skills are associated with each kit, so you know when to equip certain kits, and what skills to use in them. The difficulty/skill cap of kits is getting used to the cooldowns of kit skills since the kits themselves don't have cooldowns when equipping/dropping them.
---
If it's not about other people then why would you care? You're still getting the special reward and you had to work hard to get it. If it's just your own personal validation you're seeking that should be enough right?
---
LFG activity != game activity.
---
most people never open the LFG tool
---
It's not like GW2 is a game that tries to retain players. This game is practically marketed on how you can take long breaks and not miss anything. Who cares if a new game comes out that will be relevant for a couple of weeks when, likely, nothing will even happen in GW2 during that time?
---
More some people, it’ll be the day that decides whether they stay or quit gw2
---
Lootboxes with extra steps..
---
Fuck off!  ;)
---
what the hell, this is actually such a good song
---
Yeah. I don't play or intend to play wow. But seems like their new classic wow servers queues are getting too full. So there is indeed a rush and can hurt gw2 a bit. 
---
This announcement and its timing 3 days after the classic wow going live, doesn't seem to be a coincidence. A dev even said they have been working for a year towards this announcement content. (I can't find that damn link!). It's very unlikely Anet won't notice the classic wow release date.
---
Personally, I do agree with you. People are moving for nostalgia factor. most players will experience that just the nostalgia won't help alleviate the 2004 levels of QoL any game has.
---
Best plan Blizzard's had in a while, lol.
---
Yeah, everyone knows that children can play the slots if they pull the lever, but only adults can just push the button.
---
Just because the gem store isn't offering practical things like in-game advantages doesn't mean it isn't predatory. The perceived value of the items are what matters, and considering that GW2 is basically a dress up game at this point cosmetic items are seen as valuable by plenty of players.
---
but i want big shit coming
---
Thank you so much for the reply,
---
does this website is trusted? I rarely buy from websites like these so yeah &gt;_&lt;
---
The game may feel empty, but it is not.
---
Many people will do the HoT metas, if i do one of my HP trains i get easily 40+ people in my squad. So its not like there arent any people but they dont spread even. LFG is a good example only people with somr exp will use it, most dont even know it exists, or dont use it as intended (Bossblitz squads NOT in the festivals tab e.g.)
---
For starter areas, well there is not that much of a reason to stay in them, if you are one of those i consider lucky (newcomers who can actually explore stuff cuz its unknown) that may be another story. But the good stuff is in the maps with a higher level, that is were people will go to (HoT mostly).
---
Worldbosses, welp there is a active community for them (3x trouble) and lately we had those boss rushes (i dont see a point in them). The issue for those, to me, seems to be that they are old stuff that didnt age well.
---
PoF maps, those are nice maps or trash, depending who you ask. They are LARGE but activities are still not scaling on most maps (metas maybe), so they feel less populated, some stuff people dont even know about (eg the dwarven ruinds in the highlands). Also the rewards for doing stuff on PoF maps (ignoring Dragonfall) are not as goodas in HoT.
---
There is quite some frustration ongoing for GW2, its not that people dont like the game, its more about that we dont know if and how it will go on. If you see it pesimistic the festival/"rush"-event spam could look like a last atempt to get money out of people before the game gets smushed.
---
What me keeps playing GW2 isnt the content, its the community and the idea behind it, + other races besides humans
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Tl;dr
---
This game is not near being dumped yet by current players, but the way Anet tells us about its future is shallow (to say it kind).  And THAT is what hurts the game regarding its representation by streamers/media/forums. Many people did already finish the contend they wanted, or worse ran out of it (dungeons eg). 
---
And then there is the age thing, at some point you dont have the time to play games that much anymore, people may have lives.
---
What type of stupid logic is this? No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play another round of roulette or the slot machine (hopefully). Do you think gambling addicts are just putting on an act or something? People who perceive value from these virtual items can be manipulated into spending money to try and gain more of said items. Doing this is predatory.

I'm sure more people would like to raid but don't have the obnoxious requirements set by the community **to** raid.

Be careful on which build you're looking at. Condi weaver runs Burning Rage where as power sword weaver runs power overwhelming. In a raid scenario you will always have 25 might (if not your supports are doing something wrong) and you're spending 1/2 to 2/3rds of your time in Fire attunement depending on whether you're Bolt to the Heart or Fresh Air. Burning Rage is better for condi weaver due to the flat stats and the fact that expanding the sun spot range is very useful/important for the dagger variant in particular where you're dashing around.
---
The item will have a red "Limited time left at this price!" warning on it when it's within its last day of sale.  That's the best timer you'll get, unfortunately.
---
Blame the raid community for closing off the entry points.
---
I used to run a lot of frostgorge champ runs during its bonus week. The selfish rambos happen and not much you can do about it other than yell in chat and private message them when you see them to go with the group. Ideally once the group gets into a good enough rhythm and gets things done fast enough that won't happen anymore as the group gets there close to when it respawns.
---
"Raiding is easy" but then require everyone to join a training guild and have proof of having already done the content multiple times to get into groups... 
---
Yeah it doesn't make any sense, right?
---

&gt;  Metabattle has an up-to-date gear guide.
---
Metabattle's guide is actually really out of date (last update Jan, well before the major gear changes too) which is why I've been keeping [Tanetris' guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) updated.
---
Thanks again for linking my guide! :)
---
Engineer you can just play kitless holo and do just fine until you get the hang of a single swap and can slowly add in minmax stuff.
---
Reminds me of how everyone makes Mario and Zelda and other popular stylized concepts in Unreal. It's always flashy and nice for 30 seconds, but the  presentation loses all personality, and I don't think I'd actually want to play those games.
---
send it to [godsofpvp.net](https://godsofpvp.net), good guide
---
This isn't the case. They have play testers that are good at the game to test the game. We know for a fact that certain guilds are allowed into raids on the alpha server to test that content. There have always been players testing the game, it's just not a public test.
---
Oh hell yes! I can't wait to ride that crane!
---
Actually you only need 400, not 410 since each enormous chest gives you 75 shards of your choice(4*75=300, with 10 shards to spare)
---
I was saying he could save some gold because directly converting tributes of exitare(or any other 2-hand weapon tributes) to shards require 40 mithril ingots and 30 elder wood planks. On the other hand, off-hand tributes only require 20 ingots and 10 planks, so although he has to make 400 shards over the original 300, the amount of mithril and elder wood required is smaller for off-hand compared to 2-handed.
---
You just explained the primary issue with raiding in general.
---
I just got the glider i want , so im happy . Its cryomancer glider
---
You don't even need to do the meta, you can just loot chests after if you have keys.
---
You also have 5 chances at the infusion in AB.
---
They don’t have a habit of doing conferences for living seasons though and Elite Specs are one of the main source of gameplay refreshment as far as the game is concerned.
---
It’s wise to not overhype ourselves but I would be extremely surprised if Elite Specs were not coming with S5, especially after they said they believe they can deliver expansion-worthy features during living story episodes.
---
I have to agree on the larger fights--they should absolutely be open world meta events like Dragon's Stand. The story should lead up to it, and then if you want to complete the story and see the last cut scene for that LW season, you need to complete the meta.
---
Within last two weeks I was astonished by the amount of players I see everywhere. There was an ARMY of about 40 new players defending farm in queensdale. 
---
Unless you play around 3am
---
Game is 15 years old and still prints money. LFR was a huge boon to the game when it first came out. The game itself is just stale because, well, people have been playing nearly the same game for 15 years.
---
This is such good advice. I always use those builds as a baseline and try to alter them for single player open world. Of course, now meta battle has an open world section which it didn't in the past, which is pretty useful as well.
---
What will drive them is to reach the rewards much faster. Time is the biggest currency in an MMO. If it takes you 5 times of running on easy vs. 1 time running on hard to get the same reward, you might after a few easy runs try hard just to see if you got better enough to save yourself time.
---
I really love that "tree children" asura, and think there's a good story to be built on him. "This is what I get" makes me think he *chose* his post - I wonder if he wanted to in some way differentiate himself from those asura who jumped immediately to vivisection. 
---
"The problem with taking a cat apart to see how it works is that the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat." -Douglas Adams
---
Sylvari seem to have rapidly acquired the arts of diplomacy, politicking, and networking after the asura debacle - and I wonder if some of that speed is BECAUSE of the asura debacle. 
---
I also wonder how Canach feels about asura, given that he's one of the secondborn rescued from Vorpp's lab. He's decent enough with Taimi but he never works with anyone for very long.
---
I would like to see a FF14 style crafting process. GW2 has a better recipe discovery system, but the act of crafting is much more involved and is almost a mini game in FF14. They have their own stats, moves, and high quality outcomes to strive for. 
---
Here, I think it would be neat to have the different tiers of loot (junk, fine, masterwork, rare, etc) as different quality outcomes based on how well you craft it, not just what level it is. When you level up a crafting discipline, it would give you better abilities to use during the process to increase the quality, rather than just access to higher level recipes.
---
It's a totally unrealistic idea, but I think it'd be neat.
---
It probably wouldn't one-shot itself from arena pulses. A pulse usually deals what, ~1500 damage? So while the gyro is up, you'd be absorbing 500 damage per person for 2500 damage.
---
But if you're dealing damage as scrapper in a raid, you'll easily be tanking that damage with barrier.
---
It's a shame. Bulwark gyro could be an interesting way to have a hybrid dps / "healer" (by absorbing damage), but it doesn't work for the majority of damage in raids.
---
because it's just vaporware with no examples or work in progress.
---
I don't think it's very fair to expect busy people to spend all their available leisure time teaching random players each fight every time they want to raid, unless they specifically have consented to that.
---
I know it's a big feelsbad when a new player looks at the lfg and doesn't see any groups that will welcome them. But it feels just as bad as an experienced player to see your available time rapidly running out with no hope a kill, because of inexperienced players who haven't gone through the proper channels to learn the fight and instead have crashed a group labeled as experienced.
---
The solution has to be baked into the system itself, so that neither group of players has to endure the unpleasantness of a group whose mission doesn't align with their goals. That's why I am hoping for easy-mode raids, which would be a systemic solution, instead of relying on people to sacrifice all their available leisure time to other people they don't know and probably will never see again.
---
So this means that since I killed one champ and got one coin reward thing, I am now eligible for all the rewards?
---
Mad king looks great on asuras!
---
I really hope they understand that they can't just say: "oh, yeah, new LS season will start in October/November this year". GW2 needs expansion-level content drop.
---
You say ab is "easy" (just dpsing a wall) and wonder if its worth... For doing nothing? Even if its 50s its worth for just "dpsing a wall" (you are getting free stuff for almost no effort ;)
---
Keep in mind the trick in ab is killing the 4 sides in a window time, each side has its mechanichs. After years since hot launch is normal that playerbase mastered that event and pof elites added a ton of damage, but at the start it was a rage/drama/panic festival.
---
True. I absolutely want to see Scrapper do that because I've always wanted a "Neuromancer" elite spec that did that same thing and got players to look into really bulky stat sets. Scrapper is trying to be that, but the numbers need to be adjusted in PvE only. Personally, I'd like to see the gyros have a much larger AoE and have something like Bulwark redirect most/almost all of the damage to the Scrapper instead of whatever it is now, 50% or something. Again, something to get the Scrapper to invest in gear that gives them enormous health pools.
---
If my inventory is any indication show up and open a bag.

---
"unexpected" really? ^^
---
You might have to get 5 and turn them in for 1 box..  Not entirely sure..
---
Not given out yet.
---
sure its not bad to push features when they are done.  But what I'm saying is, build templates should have been added years ago.  They were not started years ago. The fact that they are being added after ascended food is indicative that Anet just doesn't prioritize the correct things.
---
*1000 years ago, superstition and the sword ruled.*

*And we live again!*
---
After the first few kills, it got boring real fast...
---
I don't play FF14 but I have done Elderscrolls Online and Star Wars and both were much worse than GW2.
---
Sorry. You must do it or else Anet will come to your house and beat you up.
---
Compared to other games, they are like a drop in the bucket though.
---
That flare 😂 holy shit
---
Thank you!
---
i know ill be hated to oblivion but id like to get either tengu race or largos but thats just me...
---
Yep, this exactly. Let’s all hope it’s a pretty substantial update or expansion, otherwise no amount of whiteknighting on Reddit is going to keep it alive.
---
I would add code to the game that makes it impossible to add anything gambling related be it keys, loot boxes, black lion bs, and transforms anything already in game that has gambling and or loot box behavior into a 100% drop rate. Fuck gambling, Fuck loot boxes in any shape or form.
---
&gt; This is too fast for supposed high tier endgame content.  
---
They are optimizing stuff to the highest level possible. I can assure you this won't happen in pugs/regular groups.

Well that went better than expected. Full of "my enjoyment of my gamemode depends on the unreachability of its rewards" which was to be expected at the least, but it managed to punch through the initial hate and even reach 76% upvotes. I stand, therefore, corrected.

I can't really say much more than it's worth playing through the sunspear and joko paths. I enjoyed both and didn't regret choosing Joko on the character I did, but when you do I recommend listening to the ambient dialog in Amnoon. It's not as much of a black-and-white decision as I think people make it out to be, at least at that point in the story.
---
I started playing in beta and I just killed my first ever raid boss this tuesday. I joined training community on discord and thankfully got chosen for one of the squads. 
---
I imagine it's possible to start raiding if you consistently look for no exp or training runs in lfg, but I suppose you have to get very lucky to find such a raid at a convenient time. 
---
The people I usually play fractals with do raids every week, but their static doesn't like taking newbies, they just want to clear everything as quickly as possible and be done with it. And after my first raid this week I have to say it's understandable. You only get rewards once per week per account anyway.
---
I genuinely believe that having an easy mode just to let people see the boss mechanics and try out new roles would be good for the game. How much of Vale Guardian are you going to see if your entire group is completely new and the pulls end before the split phase? Not many people in pugs have enough patience to deal with multiple failed attempts in my experience. 
---
It's true that anyone can start a raid with no requirements. But I think people would  be more likely to sign up if there was a bigger chance to succeed while training. After that killing a boss on a normal difficulty should be less problematic.
---
Yesterday I had to restart the game a few times due to the lags. But today seems fine so far
---
Gold in WvW? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Be lucky and drop a precursor. That's it.
---
PM sent! :)
---
So... upscaled events were nerfed and these champions don't drop Marks anymore?
---
WvW can't farm gold, just tears and salt...
---
I'm a filthy casual like you, but here's an idea: join a guild, fight someone there who's good, and ask for some tough love.
---
I don't do pvp. Starting with that.
---
Are you doing your rotation correctly? There is a video by vallun on rotation. Another would be using your class correctly. I would suggest watch a lot of other streamers pvp to understand better. May be even ask the in game git-gudders if they can help &amp; advice what you should have done. one of them may decide to help you afterall. 
---
You can also record a match of yours in spvp and send the link to Woodenpotatoes. He is doing a section where he reviews pvp gameplay of other people. He is by no means 'the best' in pvp. But he is reasonable good (imo)
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Salt
---
Yeah, you don't play WvW for making gold... You play it because you enjoy it and want to work on something during that time. You can work on legendary armor, unlocking ascended skins, weapon skins, warbringer legendary backpack, etc.
---
You pick the tracks depending on your needs. 
---
* You need Mystic Clovers? All non-repeatable reward track drop 7 at the end. 
---
* You want a legendary? Gift of Battle might be needed.
---
* You want certain unique skins, there are multiple reward tracks for that
---
You do get a nice chunk of loot and materials from looting, reward tracks and pips, but that's nowhere close to many open world PvE or fractals.
---
Your best bet would be to look through the list and see what interests you. You can also check everything the skirmish merchant has for sale. Most, if not all, of it is account bound I think.
---
For a mere 750 of every map currency you two can sit on us
---
Because there's a distinct difference between skills not functioning as advertised and skills being useful everywhere. Wanting your buff that absorbs 33% of allied damage to do exactly that is just wanting it to work properly.
---
1 hour of lfg or a ratio limit of the dungeon itself?
---
A bar shouldn't get larger because the amount needed to fill it gets larger. That'd mean if the required amount gets doubled, the bar would go off-screen. I hope that it's a layout change or similar.
---
And the reason these players crashing our runs cant play with each other is....? If theres truly that many of you, it shouldnt be hard to find each other on the lfg. Honestly if the game wasnt so shit at teaching players the basics these requirements wouldnt be necessary. You pick up an average open worlder and he will guaranteed be playing at 30% of what an average raider can output.
---
Can't find the source to be honest, but google shows dozens of places where people mention "ls5 will have expansion-like" features. Not ls4, not skyscale/beetle.
---
Also, people have to be delusional thinking that devs will just do "45min trailer of 2h long story episode".
---
Guys, wake up. Open your eyes. This is some kind of huge announcement of expansion-like stuff. The only difference now is that before HoT and PoF we had everything spoilerd by leakers and dataminers up to one year ahead. There's gonna be a live event, demo zones and stuff. There is no point of wasting resources to "just show a trailer  of ls". We have no idea what's coming.
---
One more week until all those doomkids will shut up for good, can't wait.

I got an orange one too, lucky us!
---
Going to stomp GW2 population on day 1. So yeah. It is.
---
Scrapper doesn’t “shine” in PvP/WvW though. It’s an acceptable side node bunker at best in PvP and a lacking bruiser/support in WvW. The niche that Anet wants Scrapper to full means it will always be overpowered or underwhelming, just look at how the most recent patch has changed it in PvP. It used to be able to fairly comfortably 1v2 and even 1v3 on node for a long time and now it can struggle to survive against any good power/condi sustain damage dealer. Nobody cares that it doesn’t do top dps but that it fails at the niche it’s meant to fit into.
---
The point is: Shiro is granting a lot of dodge, mobillity and stunbreak. Which makes you very slippery and hard to kill with all these active defenses. Jalis on the other hand is granting %DPS reduction which only makes sense if you plann on face tanking, which is (in my opinnion) never a good idea.
---
If you need more heal sustain concider using the life steal grandmaster in shiro traitline (is buffed in PvE compared to PvP) and always use the lingering facette grand master in glinth. You'll be self buffed to 25 might, perma fury &amp; swiftness and a lot of protection uptime!
---
Just like Siren's Reef :)
---
May I remind everyone of Migraine and Arah Story Mode? Migraine was a 5-man version of a story instance, and Arah Story Mode used to be a 5-man dungeon before it was reduced to a solo experience.
---
What kind of rewards would these repeatable story instances have? To keep them relevant in the long run. Keep in mind that excluding dialogue, most gw2 instances are very very short
---
Things I like about the Aquatic Ruins rework:
---
* Dolphin form 3rd skill being replaced with stealth, and skills recharging upon swimming through whirlpool rings
---
Things I dislike about the Aquatic Ruins rework:
---
* Everything else
---
It's as if Anet has some golden rule they must adhere to, where good changes to existing content *must* be coupled with cancerous garbage.
---
And my point was that the map mechanic being used or not is not a mandatory criteria to fullfil to make it live on the ranked map rotation. 
---
NB: the current state of these maps don't suggest to use the mechanics if you want to play safe and not leading your team to a throw.
---
People are already going through five stages of grief when it comes to anet going mobile. Some are already at acceptace stage, some are still at bargaining.
---
just let me dye all my shit! i wanna dye my weapons and my backpiece!
---
Ah, I didn't realise you'd been working on Tanetris'. Cheers!
---
*raises finger*
---
*stops*
---
yeah, I don't even
---
I haven't played one minute for the past week. what am I missing?
---
Cool, they'll make some money, destroy their playerbase, and set MMOs back a literal decade.
---
*It's a bad plan*
---
Sadly new races will never happen. They'd have to create new animations and rework all armors to fit the race. All that work for nothing in return. A new skin you can play as, but no difference in gameplay.
---
1. buy a permanent tp contract
---
2. Go scout garry 
---
3. Flip tp while scouting garry
---
4. Profits!
---
He's not wrong. Even completely optimal kills shouldn't really be like this. It's not even just the speed of the overall kill, the power creep has gotten ridiculous to the point where you're able to burn through a phase in seconds. It should have never reached this point.
---
Just same as you here, i dont really watch his streams tho outside of balance patches.
---
Its gonna probably just some more robust version of LS4 tho with maybe a handfull features added in like mounts (gonna sell skins), jeweler 500 and at some point build templets (im just wondering for which people are they even made ... the only people who even bother to switch build and not run with the same **** everywhere are leaven the game on mass since PoF) which i estimate to be worse then we alrdy have with arcdps...
---
The achievement hunter community already whishing for skip buttons since basically day 1 and the latest story missions are very well developed with their own little riddles and interesting bosses with multiple phases, ect.
---
They are fun to replay, especially with friends. But having to listen to a 2 min NPC "blahblah" until next fun combat is one of the most annoying things, when revisiting story missions.
---
Play unranked before you even think about ranked, dont understand why you guys have to ruin peoples placement matches.
---
If you're expecting an expansion after they've already told us they're doing back-to-back seasons of LS, you're going to be disappointed.
---
I didn't see it at 10% though, 11h ago it was dead stuck at 1% for me.
---
While it's a flawed decision to count progress by marks, people *would* turn it in before the deadline. We still have 5 days to play.
---
I don't think that you really know what I know.
---
Mesmers was god like for ages, and the whole community know it. There wasn't a single part in the game that mesmer wasn't needed. Feel free to disagree tho.
---
Yeah, but unfortunately relying on Anet to do anything about it won't get us anywhere.
---
If only GW2 was designed from the ground up without the trinity role system that produced "lfg need healer and tank" problems. /s
---
For all the issues the absence of a trinity causes GW2's group content, they may as well make use of it's one big advantage - everyone is DPS and almost all content only needs DPS.
---
Sorry Teapot, but it isn't a lie. Every single time I open your stream you're being shady towards the game/anet/community. Being sarcastic all the time is a type of negativity too.
---
Take it, because it's a constructive critizism: Try not being this level of negative and shady and you're going to skyrocket. Not everyone is watching a stream to participate or "enjoy" drama or fire up discussions that otherwise would be constructive. Sometimes people just want to have fun and interact with a wholesome personality.
---
This isn't a "narrative". This is a viewer that loves when you're not in this mood, but lately it's all you've been.
---
&gt;Are you expecting to play GW2 on your phone? The UI would not even fit the screen, not talking about actually using skills and playing the game.
---
yes it would fit, have you seen modern mobile games?
---
though most of these posts are just memes
---
afk farm dolyacs on desert map while having ubuff and boosters on and flipping on the tp
---
&gt; Honestly it's getting through the story that is by far the biggest hurdle. 
---
Which is a bit of a shame, but also a bit weird. I mean in a way the story is also one of FF14's greatest strengths, as while it locks you into it, it also tells a genuine RPG story, instead of the tacked-on nature MMO stories often have.
---
And, maybe in violation of what I just said, it also functions as an incredibly well-done way of easing players into the game's myriad elements and systems which are quite confusing comparing many other MMOs if experienced all at once.
---
But then at the same time, yeah it's too long. They're reportedly finally working on compacting the old ARR story, though!
---
&gt; I just I don't like the mentality of "just wait it gets good"
---
Oh agreed, it's why I quit FF14 before 50 the first two times I tried it. Though I did not use a story skip in the end and just played with friends and we grouped/separated as duties required it.
---
You're ignorant and arrogant. Did you know the Greeks didn't have a word for evil? The closest word was ignorance.
---
Felt the same to me.
---
Cant buy em in belgium, not even the free one
---
As someone who was invested in GW2 specifically for the story I 100% have no issue (in fact I'm hyped) with moving the focus on narrative and cinematics and putting it on encounter design.
---
Currently they are not doing a good job of expanding GW2's narrative and the streamlined, single story focus of Living World episodes is killing the game (and the lore). How awesome would it be if Desert Highlands had a Glint's Sanctuary or Dwarven Ruins dungeon? How awesome would it be if Istan had a Faranur dungeon? Treat it similar to the original dungeons (story and explorable mode) and almost completely reuse assets (maybe even mechanics -  different bosses with the same mechanics between game modes, but the explorable ones are noticeably more difficult).
---
Personally I'm fine with hearing Braham and Taimi talk less each episode if it means we actually get to do more. Currently the gameplay of Living World episodes is a total snooze for most people and the episodes are set up as exposition fests filled with dialogue. I'm fine with less of that if I actually get to play the role of hero more. Bonus points if it actually allows me to use mounts and gliders in dungeon content for once.
---
I'm with you on that theory
---
&gt; I agree that having 10 armor sets added every few patches is amazing,
---
Every patch, not every few.  Every patch comes with a couple dungeons, raids, trials, ultimate trials being every other patch, as well as stuff like Palace of the Dead, Eureka, or whatever the new fancy system has to be.  All of these have their own unique gear, and generally crafters get a good amount of armor sets to craft up as well.
---
Seasonal items indeed do not return usually.  Theres new ones each year for each event, with only a few rare items making a return.  Cash shop is there for those who might really want something they missed.
---
I woudln't say they serve the same purpose, GW2 needs the cash shop to survive and as of such the shop is MUCH more agressive and sees a larger percent of content being added to it.  The cosmetics in GW2 are certainly more than just to copy NPC's.  Yes it serves that suppose in some cases, but a large amount of them are certainly either unique pieces, or stuff like armor from various regions.  Plus GW2 locks a lot of cosmetics behind lootboxes, is the only way to acquire new mount skins, and is home to about 99% of glider skins...  GW2's cosmetic shop isn't just for cosplay or roleplay, it houses a sizable chunk of all the cosmetics avialable in the game.  This is also only counting the Cosmetic side of things, GW2 also charges for stuff like character Inventory expansions, character slots, and many other quality of life items that you just... well kinda get for free as QoL fixes in other games.  Not to mention the cash shop in GW2 being much more intrusive and harder to ignore.
---
Which yeah, makes sense.  It's a F2P/B2P game versus a sub game.  The cash is going to be much more aggressive because of that, as the game relies on it to *survive* instead of a secondary source of income.
---
I'm certain they listed them all out on a news post
---
It is a champ free-for-all.  I'm a vet gw2 'solo' player.  I don't stand around and flex.  I kill stuff.
---
I dont know how I would feel with a mobile version of the game.
---
How does it work with other games?
---
I don't know. But what is known is that upscaling events was never reliable nor intended way. There are actual champion bosses around, even on fixed spots and fixed timers. Those should be primal targets.
---
Am I the only one who hates that this was upvoted. Yes, you don't have to. You can let everyone else do the event and then just open the chests, but really is this like something we actually want to encourage people to do. If enough people do this won't Anet just close it off.
---
It's one thing if you try to get into the full meta map and you can't because it's full and your map doesn't manage to do it, but just getting the rewards without doing the event is just tacky, for lack of a better word.
---
If you want the chests, you should do the event. We have enough leechers in the game already.
---
Aquatic should be scrapped. It just isn't fun even when you know what you are doing.
---
Makes me want to get back into speedrunning
---
&gt;Most people already don't do that. GW2 Raid content is so little played it might as well not even exist to the general playerbase.
---
exactly and that's why more difficulty modes are useless in GW2. because the majority are casuals.
---
Anet would spend a lot development time in something maybe 1-5% of the community is playing.
---
The problem with an easy mode is that it’s impossible to incentivize well. If easy mode has similar rewards to hard mode, why will anyone play hard mode? (Seen in raid cm’s) If easy mode has less rewards than hard mode, nobody’s gunna play with the noobies like it is right now. All there will be is trainers willing to teach people on the easier levels... except we already have that with training guilds/discords. What I think the game needs to do is encourage players to actually raid. The resources are there for people to start raiding, it’s just that they are either scared or unwilling. We need to remove the idea that raids are all super hard, since some are pretty simple compared to others. People need to know you don’t need to be the best at the game to raid; there are people willing to help you get there. We need to properly spread the word that raiding is for anyone that wants to raid.
---
If that doesn’t work, we just have a casual player base, which is completely fine.
---
It. Does. Not. Work. Like. That.
---
The only thing that will come anywhere near quadrupling is the development work.
---
Isn't that just the usual trials of party based mmos, balance of players doesn't match the distribution needed for group content, and it's almost always the DPS that's in excess.
---
But I want to jump
---
&gt; And the reason these players crashing our runs cant play with each other is....?
---
How should I know? I don't lie to get into groups, therefor I can't get into groups. It's laughable. I've completed the literal hardest "90% of the playerbase hasn't seen this raid" content in other games but people demand I join their group to train me to 'not stand in fire'. Of course, I'm not going to say I'm pompous enough to be absolutely perfect, as sight-reading a bossfight is practically improbable, but Guild wars does not have the market on hard boss fights.
---
What even do you mean 'the basics'? The game is literally wear gear for stats, dodge shit, don't stand in shit, and have traits that work well with eachother. Just because people aren't 100% ascended or meta builds doesn't mean that they shouldn't even be allowed to play. I'm sorry everyone wants the easiest possible time to do raids every week but yall choose that exclusionary stance at the health of your own raiding community. 
---
Of course, if ANet bothered to give some kind of reward to multiple runs a week and bonuses for new/undergeared/inexperienced players like *other games*, this whole issue would be dead within the month and have sorted itself out, but *shrug* lead a horse to water and so forth.
---
I would much prefer if you could trade the marks for rewards instead of trading them for damn lootboxes which have a random chance to give you something even remotely useful. That's the worst design.
---
The thing with mobile is....people don't want the mobile title to replace pc version. It is inferior in all aspects to play on mobile when you can sit at your 25 inch screen pc, in good gaming chair, with mouse and keyboard...
---
However, some companion app might be a success if done right. Imagine getting whole SAB, or polymock battles, or such. Imagine being it connected to main game, you would still have to get minis ingame and then use them on mobile. And vice versa. I believe such would be easily accepted, as an extension to do when you are not at home. Especially if you would be able to do such off activities even in game. Imagine costume brawl ranked.... :D
---
After all, mobile games are "success" mainly because of total predatory practices....ads everywhere, purchases everywhere, macrotransactions...people watch ads and pay amounts that they would never do on pc.
---
Anet loves giving participation rewards and people still squeeze their hogs every time it happens.
---
That's how rewards in gw2 usually work.
---
Pardon my naivety, but do you get a boost with the expansions? Or would I be better off to wait till I hit max level before purchasing?
---
&gt; People need to know you don’t need to be the best at the game to raid; there are people willing to help you get there. We need to properly spread the word that raiding is for anyone that wants to raid.
---
Step one of that is to stop demanding full ascended in a mode that is meant to reward you with ascended gear. Stop circulating guides and youtube videos that ask this as step one. It's the same bullshit that hurt wow with the 'Raid gives i340 gear, must have i360 gear to apply.'
---
Step two is to remove the cult of personality from raid training groups, or just remove raid training groups altogether. I'm not going to fill out a damn job application to play a game at non competitive levels, that's just unreasonable.
---
5½ months and counting
---
I play ele now. :3
---
For those like me that didn't participate yet because they planned to later due to time restrictions: at the present time you can still earn marks and turn them in. In other words: they don't seem to have stopped the event quite yet, but you might need to be fast to qualify.
---
The expansions are designed to add content past level 80, you aren't missing anything unless you wanted to unlock the first mount early. Each expansion comes with a level 80 boost but I do suggest leveling normally your first time through. The big difference would be removing the free to play restrictions if you wanted to get that out of the way but it's expected that the expansions will go on sale soon so I'd hold off till then and get them both.
---
its you, go see a doctor
---
Excellent, thank you very much!
---
There was a stat change for gear kind of recently too, make sure you have stats selected in the drop down menu for each piece.
---
Dodge out of the bubbles.
---
It was going in that direction, but never quite made it there. It would be great to have dialog recognising the tiers, have specific tasks per faction and much more progress to go for the later levels compared to the hot masteries. These could be pure prestige such as titles or armor access locked behind the "grindier" tiers.
---
Probably because of the [uncanny valley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley).
---
Where do people usually go for champs? I haven't seen anything in lfg yet.
---
Like almost every aspect you say, at least from what i could decipher is mostly experienced based. Seeing upcoming skills comes from watching the animations.
---
Buffs degrade faster because the combat is fastee. You gotta work that into your Rotation. 
---
Also the camera is the same in almost every mmo.
---
And i personally never had a problem with targeting.
---
I’m sorry but this is bad advice. Why would a thief use acrobatics if they already have the super broken Invigorating Precision????? IP is more than enough. You want more damage to heal yourself even more from IP. 
---
How are mantras defensives for mesmers when they can instead take blink and clone generation to get away from danger and spam clones to tank
---
And using water as an specialisation on elementalist on a power build is useless. You have no healing power (and you shouldn’t have any in open world) so water is already very weak. What are you going to do with water? Run away trying to heal yourself so your enemies have time to recharge their skills? Elementalist open world will go into downed state all the time, and they will rally all the time with the absurd lesser lava font trait 
---
In open world and story content, the best defence is a good offence. Kill them before they kill you. Learn to pick your battles and when to run away. And use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scoop_of_Mintberry_Swirl_Ice_Cream and learn to dodge
---
Don't WvW for money. While you do get some money from WvW you're kinda expected to get the WvW rewards rather than using gold. It's stupid I know but now that EoM has been nerfed its not really viable anymore. Treat whatever you get out of WvW as a bonus and be thankful that armor repair doesn't cost anymore.
---
You talking about the exotic hunter collection?
---
They can make it like fractal 100cm and 99cm. Going CM removes all cutscenes, then they can just have players port through the difficult “story beats”. It’s not like hardcore players care about the spectacle. The only spectacle they care about is boss mechanics.
---
They did it propperly with rev, nec, war, ele and guard. They messed up the drawbacks with mes, thief and ranger. 
---
Engi drawback is fine/makes sense but overall scrapper is in the worst spot throughout the gamemodes and needs again a rework (really bad since it was just done).
---
Left out "Playable LW Season 1"
---
Thank you friend. I will take your suggestions.
---
The rewards most definitely shouldn't be the same. They should also be completely separate from other difficulties imo. 
---
I can only compare to WoW here, where I actually raided heroic mode and was not the target audience for LFR (the easiest difficulty with automated queue). I can say that LFR is (a) largely popular among more casual players and (b) regular raiders do get something out of it, namely the runes that buff your char and are used in higher difficulties. Also alts can be geared there and some skins have unique coloring. At least that's how it was in the previous expansion. 
---
Giving out raid food for example would probably be a somewhat decent incentive. Maybe a certain amount of magnetite shards or some new currency per week.
---
Now about what we have right now. Training communities exist and they're amazing for willing to help other people. But they require extra effort and many people are unwilling to look for help outside of the game. There's a difference between pressing a button to join a raid ingame and having to sign up for a raid in discord and possibly not even get into a squad. They also don't run those trainjng raids every day, so if you work late for example, you might never be able to join. 
---
I also think an easy mode would attract a completely different slice of GW2 population which is now held back by meta requirements, if not Li.
---
Most of weavers damage is burning in general, I’d recommend getting some burning duration runes.
---
Is it harder to gear an elementalist for fractals when they only have one weapon (2 agony infusion slots as compared to 4)???
---
It isn't broken, hence why it never saw major play in my legit mAT comps. Sure you saw some but it never was a deciding factor on a match because sitting in a node is meaningless if you lose the rest of the map.
---
Technically the best reward track is the Gift of Battle because you can sell that to legendary crafters.  If you don't want to get burned by potential scammers, then you're best off getting the reward track guild buff, reward track amulet enrichment, and having a candy corn gobbler to have the +50% gain from the XP booster.  Then just do a volatile magic related reward track and convert to trophies and sell.  Its not great by any means but its something.  I think WvW is roughly 4g/hr + whatever loot bags you get.
---
Don't. It's a casual game after all. Keep tapping 1 at range
---
&gt; like happened with
---
implies that they are testing a system for the new release in a safer environment, and has nothing to do with the actual old events.
---
I mean they still rush stuff out, see Kourna for example. "When it's ready" my ass.
---
Is there an intent to fix the starting/intro missions?  I just went through one and it disabled everything except the autoattack.  
---
It was *bad*, I mean really bad and someone needs to look at it because disabling everything but the blandest, least immersive skills is a horrible way to hook people into the game.
---
I came back to the game After a year and a half away. I tried to play my power staff tempest again, but it feels horribly weak. Lava font doesn't do any damage (fire auto attack is stronger), and ennemies take way too long to go down. Any advice on which direction I should take while not going condi ? (Other weapons ? Fresh air is viable again ? Weaver doesn't require to have 20 fingers ? )
---
Yes, I want that mobile TP access too, but that + mobile crafting, maybe even mobile Mystic Forge would be even better.
---
don´t forget the lvl 67 underwater weapons many people are using from the personal story
---
Then, I think, we can agree that *a few* people think so. But not (many/all) "people" like in the comment above.
---
It's mostly that when you level up you start getting access to more skill slots in your in your weapon then utility skill bar, and you are level 1 in there by default. Not that they strictly deactivate everything for the instance. Iirc from my key runs if you level up during the initial instance with Tomes you will get access to your other skills so they do not remove them no matter what.
---
For the rest I am afraid there is nothing we can really say or do from here as it is a player managed question thread, Anet is not really lurking in there to answer questions.
---
It's like everything they touch in fractals turns into never ending interrupt and condi vomit shitshow that's specifically "fuck you regular players, you're not getting your crap rewards today unless you stack classes". Also screw players that don't play an hour or two after prime time. First siren's Reef and now this :(
---
20 times 0 is still 0, no? The hardest part of that was not being oneshot by kraits as a dolphin.
---
I completely agree with that notion. I'm trying to get at is a way to improve survivability without altering gear. (yes i know rage runes and pack runes could be insanely strong,and boon upkeep is definitely smtg to consider for solo builds)
---
&gt;This damage will proc afflicted  
---
  
---
fuck me that explains a lot. It was my first time doing aquatic today I didn't even know they changed it. This must be a massive oversight about mechanics interactions, surely. Like how birds interacted with all the other instabilities.  
---
this fight feels like it was balanced for land power levels, but anet forgot that underwater combat is stuck in 2012 and half the skills don't work, and there are no support weapons.
---
Why would they invest ressources into those though, for the one purpose which is uw fractal to run a build that doesnt work because half of your abilitys dont work underwater. Also most uw weapon skills are trash aswell
---
&gt;But, if they ... will announce a mobile Guild Wars game in any capacity on that day I will stop playing the game
---
But if you love the game like I believe you do from your comments, why would you outright *quit playing*, instead of just decide not to use the mobile feature? It's like saying "I play only PvE, but if they don't fix PvP or WvW soon I am quitting".
---
You can still enjoy the parts of the game you love, WHILE supporting improvements or opposing things you object to elsewise, right? Doesn't have to be a reason to just quit, I think.
---
I am not trying to jumpstart a controversy or reddit-fight here sir/madam, just wanting to understand the underlying motivation for your statement better.
---
Really badly. That's a bad, bad GPU.
---
&gt; Scrapper doesn’t “shine” in WvW though.
---
I guess it is outlceansed by Tempest then, the class that is single-handedly causing the meta to be pretty much completely power focused right now.
---
If you have issues seeing things and the combat being too fast, i'd would advice you to try a more tanky and 1v1 focused build. 
---
1v1 will allow you to see the other much much more clearly (unless it's a mesmer) and experience what ability kills you, look at the animation of the big important skills, stuns, ect. When you die and inevitably start thinking the other build is broken OP, look at the skills/traits/ect in a build editor like gw2skills, think of ways to counter that and you'll slowly learn and improve.
---
gw2 pvp is not noob-friendly for sure, and like every mmo, it'll take quite some time investement to truly understand what the hell is hapening.
---
No reason they'd shut down Gw2 because of it. Maintenance mode + it would still take at least a year to come out.
---
^ this. Want. Sword warhorn overloading weaver, lets go!
---
As i suspected and also thank you for giving us a straight up answer about it, much appreciated :)
---
Or people playing the game whilst the "trains" are spewing out shit in the chat in the worst bully sort of way scaring any new commer off the game. But hey let's not talk about how terrible behaviour this is, let us blame the other people who just run by a champ and kill it, because it is their damn fault so they deserved to be bullied.... right?
---
You also have to make a UW build, you know? If you take your land skills/traits and want to use them 1:1 underwater, Of Course it will be trash.
---
Maybe they should finish the 25 fractals with underwater ones from now onwards, so there is more of them in rotation, so people actually learn their classes.
---
No trinkets of backpieces (unless blood ruby stuff of mist trinkets from fotm)
---
this is bound to happen with how power scaling in gw2 works.  
---
having the right teamsetup with the right buffs makes such an insane dps difference to "random comp" that you'll either get super fast high end kills or 10min fights for unoptimized groups.
---
Take a decent UW build (and a breather with the right rune) and you will be fine. 
---
Let your gruop do so as well and the fractal is easy. 
---
If you don't change anything for UW combat, of course it's trash. But only because your build/equip is trash, not because of the combat system.
---
only if it was originally stat-selectable, and then only by resetting them as a side effect of upgrading them. exception to that are mist and bloodstone trinkets that have dedicated items to reset them.
---
Only some specific ones have this feature (e.g. the ones bought for bloodstone rubies ([check](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Capacitor)) and I &gt;think&lt; the pvp/wvw ones too)
---
I think that people asked for hard content 24/7 here....when it arrives, they complain again... :D
---
Was stuck at  1% for over a day so obviously it was a bug, but people just love to shit on A-Net and why we keep on seeing thist "tinfoil hats subjects"
---
Very badly.
---
It’s the fact you have to change everything for one shitty fractal which no one has ever asked for, combine that with the lack of build templates it’s a 100% skip for me now
---
Because it was a one time only event with one time only currency which they left in the game because people take breaks and come back to find out they have the currency but are not able to use it. A good choice from A-Net imo, but hey let us whine about everything that Arena Net do even the good choices.
---
Also it was a very liked event because you could get really nice things from it which back then we did not really have the flashy stuff and GW2 fashiion was resoable. So there for people were farming this even non stop.
---
its sad to me that they removed the solo skippability of the middle part. i hate to dig up this argument for the 5 billionth time but such skip sections are a challenge that dungeons offered thats hardly represented in any of current endgame content
---
Maybe it needs different team compositions. Imagine having 2 characters ready and switch based on fractal and/or instabilities...
---
Why it is surprise that underwater fight has different meta than ground fight?
---
If this was the case then how come there are multiple instances in the lfg-tool and each map have several tags up calling out champs?
---
I wouldn't bet on that.
---
Just to throw in my 2 cents here, MINIONMANCER IS A BAD BUILD, PLEASE DO NOT USE IT.
---
She replied to us, which is better then noone saying anything and us knowing nothing.
---
Sounds like you drink beer from very ...very small glass!
---
I just did a full map completion (finished this sunday). Did not see any influx of anything, maps were deserted, very few people, most alts.
---
My fractal groups take longer than ever to fill.
---
Yesterday TD failed because there was not enough people (each line had a comm in lfg and we were the only map doing meta). 
---
I don't see such influx.
---
I will never say this game is skill based when you can run condi thief and insta anyone at no ceiling. the worst player in the game can down a rev with condi with only one steal. that's a problem.
---
Its her job.
---
my zerk soulbeast using elite stance, harpoon #3 and spear #5 almost melts champions alone in open, got ascended breather and weapons on that one, i can't check dps, but i guess it's preeeetty high.
---
my mesmer and my ele damage, on the other hand.. seems very bad.. 
---
i shall be honest, i'm ok with uw combat, but i'd like to get a proper testing area
---
Welcome to the WvW corner!
---
&gt; I can’t believe we as a playerbase that have become so lazy
---
Anet don't provide any incentive to not be lazy. If underwater became a bigger part of the PvE endgame then people would have to learn and adapt to it. If people cared about PvE endgame then people would adapt to it to satisfy their competitive needs. But considering underwater combat is inferior to land weapons so most players ignore it, and there is no real reason for most players to even do every daily fractal, it's an easy choice not to do it. Since the majority of rewards are gold-based anyway it might be reasonable for someone to do some other content instead of fiddle around with underwater.
---
To be honest ALL MMOs have terrible leveling quests.
---
/signed
---
Well, since you didn’t see what class you were playing it’s hard to compare it.
---
Different classes also have different builds and specifications that have a huge impact on what you’re doing. A ranger can either be 1111114111114111114 or it can spec into a Soulbeast spec that has it swapping beasts left and right, jumping in and out.
---
The other thing is - what level are you? Combat doesn’t get “hard” outside of dungeons until the end game, which is level 80. Very easy to get to as well, just takes a little time, but not grindy like WoW.
---
Once you are into raids, fractals, etc, the end game content is very engaging.
---
Leveling, by design, is mostly pretty simplistic.
---
Dunno, Aquatic was enough for me to learn my class. Sure, I could have slacked on autos and still beat the boss, but I didn't. So maybe it's a good thing if you can't do that anymore?
---
Try elementalist (or revenant if you have expansions).
---
i always hated that you get locked utility skills UW. 
---
those locked skills should just transform into UW variants.
---
It's only a spammy mess if you don't really understand the combat. There are rotations. There are quite complex rotations for some classes. A lot changes if you have the expansions. Weavers (elementalist specialization) can be quite complex. Mesmers and Engineers can be complex too.
---
Dont' assume because you can beat stuff running around the open world spamming anything that that's the combat system. One dev said a good player does 500% more damage than an average player...not a bad player, an average one.
---
You won't really be tested until you get into the harder end game stuff, and then combat can be pretty demanding. And very fast paced with no global cooldown.
---
As people already said, you don't get rich in WvW. And tbf it is a struggle for them to find a way that don't bring in the PvE farm train in to WvW but at the same time reward the dedicated WvW players. A struggle that have become a tad bit better since the first years were the only loot we got was crafting bags. But still hopefully can bring some better options in and still avoid the pve farm train.
---
Anyway you got some sugestions already what to do with what we have. And i want to add that when it comes to reward track then The Crystal Desert reward track is always the best pick. It give you a lot of rares to salvage, it give you a lot of crafting materials and a the end box is exotic armor were you can choose all the stats (for all expac you have) to gear up alts, get all the wardrobe unlocks or just salvage. You also get Elonian Trade Contracts which you can use to buy things in PoF with.
---
But what makes it profitable is that it also give you a lot of trash items which are worth anything from 10 silver to 1.5 gold. I play wvw a lot and get around 10 gold every day just from those trash items. 
---
It is ofc a very small number of gold if you compare to what you can get out of PvE but it is the better option to pick when it comes to gold and rewardtracks.
---
Revenant now has one of the hardest hitting skills in the game underwater, trident 5
---
The only thing that bothers me is that i didn't play s1 and i got no idea who the people on my team are supposed to be, S2 starts with you guys being a team that went through some stuff, i'm there like who tf are these people. 2 seasons later i still don't give a fuck about any of them, only taimi and bran had some decent airtime i guess but i got no idea how we came together
---
That's rock paper scissors. Every builds should have effective counterplay, and this thief is effective counterplay against revs. Nothing wrong there. Same thief is useless against other classes. It is up to the team and rev to know when fight is unfavorable for him and dodge the thief, rotate with someone else that is more effective against it. That can still be considered skilled play, even though on a bit more macro level than just certain fight.
---
I saw an alert on (Facebook I think) about the event the other evening and was just trying to dig.  [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/) is on the website.  Hopefully it's a bit deeper than " It’s almost time for you to set out on your next adventure. Are you ready to catch the very first look at an all-new chapter in *Guild Wars 2*‘s Living World story? " As I'd love to have a bigger reason to get back into the game.  
---
To be fair, I've legit been on and off over the years with both Guild Wars but I have very much enjoyed my time in those games so it's just frustrating that it's a slower roll with new "big" content.  September puts us at 2 years from the last Expansion so maybe there's a tease for something more than the next chapter in the Living World story but that's the front end of the discussion and a way to try and deter spoilers from a surprise bigger announcement.
---
The new Lion King movie looks like it has no art direction either because of their strong focus on photorealism :/
---
confi thief is the best 1v1er in the game, can still a node forever against any bunker class, and kill any class given time and los. it's pretty meme and broken.
---
Everyone has been saying that for years. I'm just grateful the elite necro skill got added. Your golem used to die instantly the moment you entered water then you had to wait for the damn cooldown again.
---
Hey man you never know 😂
---
Maybe. That other poster said they can see them in the shop. 
---
I'm not sure what's going on. I'll just keep checking each day I guess. Also waiting for the character slots.
---
In my experience the reddit community is more toxic than the general ingame community.
---
There's still a lot of variability in how much DPS each class can do underwater, the balance is awful and most skills hit like wet noodles. But there are exceptions, like an elementalist also does very well underwater with any type of Fresh Air build.
---
For solo open world yeah this is probably ok, but for meta events where all you have to do is dodge mechanics more dps will mean you have a more significant contribution to the event.
---
Hard and annoyingly gimmicky are two different things though, and thanks to the random shitshow that instabilities are fractals don't feel hard just incredibly annoying like nobody ever did any playtesting before shipping it. 
---
Imo everything they did to fractals (except removing birds and slipslope) after Observatory just made them worse.
---
I wouldn't mind harder underwater content if we could actually use all the skills there and classes were properly balanced for it.
---
" Havent seen any of those guides, there are better ones out there anyways. "
---
You haven't seen any cause you didn't search them I presume. If you haven't seen them how do you know that there are better ones? Make sense of your sentence first...
---
"No one cares about twich, and the garbage content he does there can hardly be called anything. "
---
No one cares about Twitch because ANET doesn't care about Twitch. "Garbage content" I bet you never saw to even judge it justly xD
---
" Erp is a big joke. "
---
ERP is best joke because every other GW2 event hasn't come close to beating it in any way.
---
I thought exactly the same untill I realised the potential of  the combat system and how it works.
---
A rotation in wow is usually 3 to 5 skills. 
---
Depending on the class but some rotations in GW2 in high end content takes at least 10 skills, rince, repeat.
---
That is very interesting. What would also be interesting is: even if your chanced would be 100%: would it be worth (from the standpoint of gold) to do this?
---
Repeatable 5 man pve content
---
You can get an easy ascended one from Bitterfrost Frontier
---
It's not that siren's or aquatic are too hard, it's that most of the other T4s have become ridiculously easy over time with experience and power creep. These newer fractals are designed with a certain level of challenge in mind for right now, whereas older fractals were designed with a similar level of challenge in mind for ages ago and have now been made braindead easy by power creep.
---
They must have went out of their way to make the progress bar go backwards
---
" Sometimes I think people who complain about bugs merely existing are brand new to the games industry. "
---
Or ppl  don't care about having informed opinions. All they need is a statement. Arguments are for those who are trying to refute. :D
---
Basically underwater fractal was one of the "shorter" ones. And, as previously stated, ANet wants to make all short fractals longer, because too much easy loot. The joke is on pugs, of course, as mathematically speaking there will _always_ be a "shortest" fractal in overall list, even if every fractal gets bumped to 40+ minutes (the desired outcome, I presume).
---
TL DR: do not run with pugs, just do it with static group.
---
bitterfrost frontier has ascended ones.
---
&gt; Also the bubbles that take you away form the fight and you lose control of your character.
---
Dodging breaks the bubble.
---
&gt;And a semi-random but constant room-wide interrupt that cancels resurrections.
---
Don't bother ressing other people underwater anyway, as it's kinda bugged compared to doing it on land. Just keep them away from adds and let them res themselves (self-res is also kinda broken uw).
---
&gt;any "mechanic" in any game where you lose control of what you're doing, let alone constantly throughout a fight with no counterplay.
---
Aside from the attack where the jellyfish eats you (and you just press the correct button a few times to break free), there's proper counterplay to every mechanic here. Run a healer that can stack might underwater and give stab (healbrand is obviously good here, heal scrapper is half-decent, and I'm sure there are others) and you'll have no issues with the pulsing stun. Keep people healed up during the split phases and the boss is cake.
---
On the other hand, I kinda want land zombie shark now..
---
It is not particularly hard at all
---
yes, you didn't read the mail the game sent you upon logging in.
---
I mean, that's just obvious bullshit. You can see in-game how some costumes are made with single textures that couldn't be separated cleanly into pieces. The edges would not match up well with any other armor pieces. How exactly do you think you're going to split the Starborn outfit chest and legs, or Lich's Raiment legs, into an armor piece that fits with other armors?
---
I'm quite sure that *some* outfits could, with effort, be cut up into armor pieces, because some armor sets actually do have pieces that look like boots and gloves and whatnot. They would have to be made individually into every armor class, because different armor classes don't even use the same mesh, which just increases the work. But all? That's just a boldface lie. And even for the ones it's possible, you probably wouldnt get the entire armor set and it would be a lot of work to get anything at all.
---
Tone down the hate boner, it's taking too much blood from your brain.
---
Good points, it needs to come from both sides. I am not familiar with the history of anet with gw2.
---
You can change stats on rings and backpiece, if some specific conditions are met :
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat\_changing#Trinkets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing#Trinkets)
---
check your route to the game servers, your ISP or anything in between your computer and the servers could be affected by something that increases the ping like package loss.
---
Core content is easier, it's gets a bit tougher in the expansions.
---
i didn't understand the complexity of combat until I was forced to in Heart of Thorns.
---
So that you can have a shark spear that summons ghost sharks on crit
---
Preaching to the choir
---
I got lvl  80 UW gear and this fractal is still just a grindy spam fest
---
&gt; I see t4 dailys as a grind
---
Don't do it then?
---
Do something else. Go outside. Live life.
---
Games are supposed to be fun, not a chore.
---
WTB Build Templates.
---
Actually WTB automatic trait swaps when underwater. If we can do it for skills we can do it for traits. 
---
Gear swapping isn't that much of an issue, but at worst it's a couple of clicks in the gear panel, everyone should be used to that by now. And it's not like it's going to be a surprise when you do the fractal since no fractals are random anymore, so you have time to fix your build before you go in.
---
There was a train in Frostgorge Sound the other day when there was a daily for event completion
---
And what if you equip two underwater legendaries?
---
This, I got sick of underwater fights being so long and dangerous, so I invested in some proper gear and it was well worth it. You don’t go underwater all that often but it’s nice not to be completely useless when you do.
---
While you are correct that you CAN make gold in WvW it really isn't in comparison to things outside of WvW.
---
I mean, all of those things you mention can get you gold but it depends a lot on which world you are on (so you can get loot bags from enemies), how good you are at tagging or rushing from objective to objective.
---
I am not disagreeing with you, but I guess they felt it might work like resistance gear?  I mean that generally makes you worse in every way but one.  This just takes that a step higher.
---
Again, I don't know that I agree with that idea, but I could easily see where it came from.
---
Specifically the mist bands in pvp/wvw yes, but the reset costs a stack of either memories of battle or shards of glory (~18g and ~2g last I checked) so a bit pricey but having the option is nice.
---
Doesn't have a breather? I like to think that the commander is just really good at holding his breath for large amounts of time.
---
Now you're cooking with water
---
I remember when this trailer first came out. I had watched it like a dozen times straight.
---
If you play thief... ignore the hate. For some reason a lot of people are blaming the thief, if they loose.
---
To figure how good / bad you are is actually not that easy. You can get a grasp on how good your micro is, if you 1v1 the same class (and build) you are using. If you easily get beat up, your oponent must be extremely good or you suck in this departement.
---
Macro play is a lot harder to check. But I'd say you're relatively good, when you have a good grasp on what enemy players are where at every time. You shouldn't get surprise ganked at any time. (the exception is enemy +1 thief, because it's basically his job to surprise their enemies. If you can keep this player tracked, you're above average for sure)
---
If you combine both micro and macro play this should result in:
---
\- low death / game
---
\- You avoiding the encounters you can't win
---
\- You exploiting the encounters, that can't deal with you
---
\- You beeing already there and ready, when important map objectives pop up
---
\-------------
---
The "highest stats" can be missleading (because you could have done a very good job without getting any of the top stats), but if somebody is rocking several top stats in the game, this means he did a fairly good job.
---
I do agree with that but it needs a massive overhaul first imo
---
It literally does shine in WvW though since it has some of the highest healing and cleanse available along with some group damage reduction and absurd amounts of superspeed and has been a staple of the meta ever since they gave it anti toxin runes. You see multiple scrappers in every squad. While I agree the class has issues its viability in WvW definitely is not one of them when its one of the strongest classes you can play in WvW at the moment.
---
In case of Weaver, all it really is missing is high might stacking + uptime. Fury uptime is excellent and it can cap Vuln easily. It is also easy to crit cap simply by switching out lightning hammer for Signet of Fire or if you’re already using it, slotting a few assassin’s pieces, which most people who have done high level fracs and dungeons in the past already have.
---
Also, saying Weaver is quite low on your scale clearly just shows your opinion of the class is based on hearsay and not actually studying and learning to use it.
---
I will admit that getting the same results on a Weaver might be way harder than on other classes so people that don’t want to go through that effort shouldn’t main Weaver. But if you commit you’ll get the same results.
---
There is plenty of vids on youtube of Weaver solo’ing hard group content, open world and instanced, that make very minor changes to the Raid build.
---
Ummm.... Playing against other players is more challenging than a scripted gameplay (Fractals and Raid).
---
I'm mot saying they aren't hard, but if you olay enough you can get used to the mechanics. Other players - playing against noobs is not fun but against good players, you'll have to adapt everytime.
---
&gt; Trident is garbage for power builds
---
Yeah... because trident is a condi weapon...
---
And as a condi trident is just OP on revenant. Skill 5 alone does 20 stacks of torment/burning (Mallyx/Glint). 
---
You complain about support roles, but the thing is, that UW skills got OP with the underwater patch last year, you don't even need all the boons and buffs you have on land. If you use what you have, it's enough to kill everything easily. 
---
But people jump in the water and think they could play just like on land and because that doesn't work, they complain about how "trash" UW combat is.
---
I gotta disagree on this one. GW2 underwater combat is the best of any other MMO. We simply don't have enough reason to practice.
---
Get a good trident, a good breather, and at least *try* and remember what your underwater skills are. I will not with  sympathize scrubs saying something is hard while at the same time they choose to not get better at it.
---
I think it's more insidious than that tbh -- it's a way to shield themselves later whenever the hammer comes down on straight up loot boxes. It's probably a technicality to bypass gambling rules.
---
You talk about it as if you have to switch your stuff several times a day.
---
I mean how often is UW fractal daily? Right, it's *one* time in 15 days, so let's make it easy and say it's every two weeky. One time in two weeks, that's not much. That's not much at all. Changing your class once every two weeks for fractals wouldn't be hards. Utilities switch automatically and in most cases you don't have to switch your gear.
---
What's left are traits. And switching your traits for an fractal once every two weeks isn't that hard, is it? ;)
---
Yeah, so better let's go back to the UW fractal farm, right?
---
I get that it involves more design work, more balancing work, more data entry, and more QA, but damn the principle is so simple I'm amazed this wasn't suggested earlier.
---
I wonder if this didn't become a thing because the Challenge Motes in Season 2 and HoT weren't engaged enough.
---
If you're slow you won't tag any loot in most of the pve farms too, and if you're bad you won't get the most gold out of stuffs like fractals just like wvw.
---
And from a vendor in LA in exchange of swimspeed infusions.
---
I think some exceptions are more or less fine, as long as you can still mostly preserve your build identity. like if a berserker couldn't use headbut but still banners that doesn't detract much, except change the rotation a bit. but boon chronomancer doesn't work at all underwater currently - apparently wells are too hard to implement, yet the necro wells which weren't that important were fixed.
---
obviously chrono is probably the worst off, but druid is missing a fair bit as well due to no warhorn and staff, tempest can't provide boons as well either (though dps variants are more or less fine), heal engi can't use med kit, revenant can't use centaur and dragonhunters can't even use traps (which, like chrono wells should just be spheres instead of circles and should be fixed fairly easily).
---
any ground targetted circular AoE skills should just be spheres around either the caster or the target, depending on their effect. that alone would fix a lot already. after that they should go after important skills to a builds identity and lastly (because it probably takes the most work) go upgrade weapon skills so builds can still mostly perform their roles.
---
Chrono was a hard bat to the face. I completely see why they approached it this way:
---
1. We should get rid of the F5, maybe fit it onto an existing skill, holosmith's toolbelt F5 replacement worked well.
---
2. Hmmm we should rework the other chrono F skills, to make them time related as well!
---
3. Shit the F skills are too strong if used outside of combat. What can we do?
---
 (a) we should nerf the F skills
---
 (b) we should limit their access
---
 (c) we should try both
---
5. release window is closing in. Are we ready with chrono?! What did we choose, I dont know? You're testing both right now? We'll release that and adjust later.
---
But that’s twice the price of crafting normally
---
GW2 underwater combat is still terrible. Most skills don't work, fights are terribly unengaging, variety is absolutely nonexistent and the movement feels horribly boring as well. 
---
Take Elementalist for example. You have a grand total of 1 weapon that has to fit every build. A lot of skills don't work. The rotation is the most basic stuff you've ever seen. It's just extremely anti fun, even with good gear.
---
I much prefer the underwater combat of other MMOs, where your normal builds actually work and there's much more variety. Even then underwater still sucks due to movement and related reasons.
---
It has been changed to 2 hours
---
So we're just not gonna talk about that 25 second intro? Ok.
---
Plate Of Steak
---
&gt; When really, if you just play well and run the recommended raid gear, you’ll kill things before they kill you and you’ll deal more damage than Tempest and thus be better.
---
I mean, that's just not true in many common PvE situations. If you're playing a sword weaver, and you're surrounded by veterans with ranged attacks, there's no way you're going to kill all of them before they do serious damage to you. 
---
A standard raid build doesn't usually bring enough condi cleanse or stun breaking capabilities to survive in open world, depending on the area. 
---
A player with a ranged build or AoE build that does less DPS on paper might perform better than a player with a high DPS single-target build optimized for bosses, because they can kill mobs faster and change targets faster. I'd never take a ranger longbow into a raid, but I sure as heck love it in open world for sniping down individuals or groups before I get into melee. 
---
A build in a raid doesn't care about self might generation or vulnerability, while both of those are extremely important for a solo build. 
---
There is definitely a line between "super defensive training wheels build" and "build that intelligently modifies top raid builds to the needs of solo PvE".
---
It's still the same rewards in the end. It just takes a little longer to get them on lower difficulties. Why not just faceroll the lower difficulties for a bit longer to get the rewards? It's what happens and happened to other content already where there's no exclusive rewards for higher difficulties.
---
What kind a aqua breather do you have? what kind of underwater weapon are you using? Many people still have green or rare underwater gear and now complain that the fractal is to hard.
---
Nice! Lol XD
---
I would have not noticed if I didn’t get that email.
---
Check this guide [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cttfuj/t4_aquatic_guide/)
---
&gt;Also, saying Weaver is quite low on your scale clearly just shows your opinion of the class is based on hearsay and not actually studying and learning to use it.
---
Sure, dude. Lol.  https://i.imgur.com/ddGyoL5.jpg
---
Weaver is extremely clunky without quickness/alacrity (which you somehow forgot to mention), has few very inconvinient animations, like sword fire 2 and very little actual utility. (Also LH isn't really used on weaver for like a  year now, because power weaver was pushed away in meta from bosses where it was a thing). But please, tell me more. And I already gave you simple examples for everyday tasks an open world whould be able to do.
---
Even in case of power weaver I don't think that taking defenvise traitlines or switching to defensive gear would impove it's situation, but not because  glass weaver is sufficient for the open world.
---
the only way i can even swim underwater is if i go into first person view
---
If you wanted to test this more rigorously you could record and play back frame by frame.
---
Well, they already did that with season 3 with the roller beetle. They can deliver features but mounts aren't everything players are interested in. more Elite specs and generally more versatile masteries are something players are looking forward to which, currently, was only delivered through expansions.
---
However, I do think there are a few problems with this whole thing that the players don't really see just yet. Expansions need to be bought by the player, the living world is free for everyone who is logging into the game at least once when that episode releases. If there is no expansion then there will not be any revenue from those sales and somehow ArenaNet needs to make money to keep the game running and that is currently only through gem store sales. So of course when there is no other source of revenue then the focus will be on that one that is available. And so far, players have not liked that.
---
The expectations for the announcement are high, probably too high and I already can imagine what the posts here will be about. Personally, I wait and see what they say and what they deliver. I'm not really getting that hyped anymore because there were too many times I got burned by something.
---
Git gud.
---
Or you could just use a revenant with mallyx that can both strip boons from the boss/adds and conditions/give resistance to allies. By a sheeeeer coincidence rene is the mandatory part of a typical fractal group now and it is forced to use mallyx underwater anyway (because kalla is afraid to get her fur wet). 
---
Honestly even non-cm t4 people whould learn at least some basic of proper group compositions.
---
Uhhh i have ascended weapons and breather, with sigils and runes and stuff. Still sucks.
---
You'd be right...if you weren't wrong.
---
Trash?  GW2 has the best underwater combat in the genre.
---
"Here he comes. Here he comes! HERE HE COMES!"
---
Problem is, things like these gambling things, that you can buy for real money is crippling the game experience for people who don't want to use real money on gambling, in a game they have already bought. More and more goes to the store, which could easily had been a cool achievement or some raid drop [etc.](https://etc.At) And then they could take money for actual content or specific skins, so you know what you get instead.  
---
The only way to stop this fifa mtx store madness is to ban it.  
---
GW2 is a game that opens up for using in-game currency, in the shop, which is a big plus. But I still rather see the things implemented in the game, rather than a real money shop. For most content in the game, you dont really get a lot of gold, the only real way to make actual casual gold is pips in spvp.  
---
The shop is not a problem, they need to make money. But when it becomes gambling, that's when it becomes a problem.
---
just give him a fucking breakbar again at least
---
you posted this on reddit so if you did in fact find an exploit then it's gonna be irrelevant soon
---
Level 80 breather is sold in Orr.  Exotics weapons are cheap.
---
It is only mindless and spammy when the mobs you are fighting are not a threat to you, which describes about 80% of the core maps in the core game.  In the expansion areas (Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire), the average mob difficulty is ramped up considerably, so that if you try to just spam skills, you'll likely be waypointing back from the dead repeatedly.
---
WoW was always a mixture of passive stats, passive defenses and active abilities, while GW2 leans far more towards the active side.   In WoW if you couldn't kill something, you likely needed to just get better gear with higher stats on it.  In GW2 there is little variance in total stats from gear at max level.  The best players in the game and the newest players in the game both have access to the same gear - what they do with it is what makes the difference.
---
Completely understandable, I agree with pretty much all of what you said and I get the same way when talking about stuff. I tend to rant a lot. My point was moreso that XIV and GW2 are both great games in their own regard and are both rather differently focused games.
---
I absolutely agree that people should know what they are getting into when they join a game (especially one with a subscription like XIV) the only reason I tend to push back a bit or clarify when people mention something about a game I know or play is it can drive people away if they get the wrong idea.
---
What do you mean? I got the same email, addressed to Black Sylvia.
---
As far as I know, that's not a food item.
---
It’s not a matter of hope or expectations. Simply put, if this announcement ISN’T amazing then the game will be on its last legs. This is Anet’s last chance to pull back in all the players they’ve neglected the past two years.
---
&gt; ...I like being constantly active...
---
I see.
---
&gt; ...it seems like combat is a bit mindless and spammy...
---
Normal, open world things (especially in core Tyria) are made to cater to shitty players - they are more for exploration. Power creep also made these maps easier.
---
&gt; ...Is there a class that's more involved and demanding...
---
Try thief.
---
Get to level 80.
---
Go to the Heart of Thorns (expansion 1) maps.
---
Try solo-ing through that content.
---
Enjoy! Tell me how it goes.
---
Rotation makes the biggest difference, you can tell they hardly know what they're pressing when they're doing 5k dps in t4s.
---
it literally does.
---
Back in the day the spear was crazy expensive to make compared to how much it sold for. Prices have evened out since but I assume very few people still make them
---
Do you have a character with a food name? If you do and they didn't address that character my assumption would be wrong of course. But out of the 13 characters I got, they addressed the one with the food name - which might just be coincidence or not.
---
Ain't that bad tbh. If you want to complain about switching gear, complain about legendary armor's customise menu omegalul
---
Hype or not, the game is dead to me if we don’t get new elite specs.
---
This is amazing! Big thanks from my newbie toon.
---
You should at least speedrun to 40 for the key. I mean, you already have the character leveled, might as well.
---
Yes.
---
The thing most of players is missing is that aquatic helmet/breather replaces terrestrial one the moment character goes below water surface. That's the one half of the problem, the second half is that aquatic helmet requires a rune of same set as the rest of the armor so the 6th bonus would activate and in most cases it'll be Scholar's *+125 Ferocity; increase damage by 5% while your health is above 90%.*; if slot is empty or occupied by different rune, bonus won't obviously work. 
---
I did learned this randomly during some random Honor of the Waves run few years ago, when party wiped on the way to the boss in P3 and one guy would start asking us about our aquatic gear. We're having ascended breathers of various stats, obtainable with currency+token or crafted, swimming speed infusions but such basic stuff isn't mentioned in the game (wiki points out about rune thing in [breathing apparatus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Breathing_apparatus) article *notes*).
---
Not what I would call a charr but okay.
---
Boon strip is bugged on this boss -- I had issues on both Mallyx and Spellbreaker trying to strip them. They simply just don't get removed most of the time.
---
There's at least 3 classes that can remove boons reliably and at least 3 that can cleanse allies. There's at least 2 that can do both.
---
Party consists of 5 people and I doubt that everyone plays the same class. Not to mention that optimized groups usually has all if these covered anyway.
---
I also play with dual monitors, and sometimes my cursor breaks free of the game, in fullscreen mode, if I get too aggressive with right click near the second monitor. I don't know if there's a way to fix this aside from just being more careful.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
It's a great thing. People will always complain when the content isn't faceroll.
---
Really? I've played rene this fractal daily run and everything was ok. 
---
The only problem was that we didn't properly focus adds at first split, so I stripped one add and 3 people were killing the other. Gotta call those targets too!
---
that is correct.
---
Do you use arc dps?
---
We’re talking open world here. Water is bad
---
Optimized groups for pug fractals? What game do you think this is? I play thief and you have to run trickery for boonstrip; I don’t use the trickery trait line because I enjoy the other ones more.
---
This is actually good because it means scrapper can protect team from the "big" attack.
---
Though it does concern me it doesn't work with Greens on VG.
---
Yes
---
or just play SPvP and make more from one pip chest than a whole match in wvw
---
It not a huge deal except if you're fighting a mesmer. Fuck mesmers.
---
Windowed fullscreen here, and only happens to me when I use some kind of overlay, like overwolf. So for me its a software issue (logitech mouse+software).
---
Maybe. I've started using a mouse tracker so I have an idea where the cursor is, but I will say this has happened whilst the cursor has been directly on top of my char.
---
Gonna try fullscreen out now and let you know.
---
Personally, I'm just killing the ones in Sparkfly while I wait for Teq.
---
&gt;Elementalist: Spec: water, earth, arcane Utility skill type: cantrips, stances (weaver)
---
My two cents, if you aren't running fire on weaver for open world there is a problem. For a casual, Pyromancer's Puissance is really good for soloing. You get 25 might by autoattacking the air if you are in combat... You could technically trait a cleanse into fire too, just like the PvP/WvW build. Earth is largely useless outside of condi and healing builds IMO.
---
Rather just go FA tempest for open world and murder everything, then run into retaliation and instantly die. As for using water traits, people don't seem to realise that water gives up to 20% damage modifier now. Not just that you also get more sustain with it than fire.
---
You'd probably enjoy killing the boss more. It's not like you have to change rotation on thief.
---
Game would be much more pleasant if people would learn how to adapt, whether it's optimal group or not.
---
Dude I was in the same position as you when I started playing the game. The best thing I did was create the other 8 classes and test out the skills in spvp training area. You get an idea of what to look out for when fighting that particular class. Every skill has an obvious animation, and the strong skills are easy to dodge if you’re paying attention. Just try out the classes that are beating you easily and see what other people do to defeat you.
---
Try to use full screen if you havent.
---
PAZUZU!
---
You sound like someone who can't read. Read again what I said.
---
 
---
everyone stick together with the revenant, revenant spam **Pain Absorption** ( [Legendary Demon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Demon) skill) granting everyone [Resistance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Resistance) . then it's all fine.
---
today i did two T4 **Aquatic** runs using my healing revenat(Demon&amp; [**Herald**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald) ), with this method we cleared **Aquatic**first try on both runs.
---
Yeap, just copy pasta change a bit most of the time. Or modified WvW/PvP builds for more damage.
---
My main account was sent to Spottermelon...a name I haven't used in ages so I didn't recognize it and I thought that it might be some new recipe they were hinting at. Then I checked an alt acct and saw it was addressed to Turnt Turnip and that's when I realized OH, they picked a random character name. &gt;.&lt;
---
Nah there are huge lag spikes in wvw, and it’s not your router. Anet are spending less money on their servers, unfortunately this is the beginning of the end
---
Trident 5 is ball to the walls powerful especially with Impossible Odds.
---
22 shots from 1200 range in 2 seconds, base 1,782 with a scaling of 4.84(!). Rapid fire can kiss my ass.
---
Game would be much more pleasant if we could just play what we enjoy. This is why Devs have such a hard time choosing a game direction.
---
As in Kindergarden, not as if someone where kind to you.
---
Yeah, or you know a central hub is having issues. but we will never know if you don't actually check the route.
---
 Gula the Void and send me those foods, I'm HUNGRY!!!!
---
###
---
When your whole squad of 50 is experiencing lag, I don’t think it’s the router buddy
---
That's not true, one of my alt accts got it sent to someone who literally does nothing but stand at Sharkmaw and open the chest when I remember to do it, and my main had it sent to a character name I've long ago deleted or renamed.
---
I'm good, thanks. What's the perfect character name?
---
Why should I when you didn’t in the first place? I was not talking about engine performance. You did.
---
pc players hate mobile game, mobile players love mobile game. majority of us might hate it, but dollars don’t lie.
---
Can confirm, we had the same issues. Necro was having problem stripping, swapped to a rev and still had issues stripping and removing.
---
I had an issue similar to this when the right-click button on my old mouse started dying.  Wasn't obvious what was happening at first until the button got worse.  Maybe try a different mouse for a bit and see if the problem persists; if it does then you can rule out hardware.
---
Oh, no, we are discussing weaver on dhuum because you accused me in not having ele experience on a decent level, while make quite funny statements about LH and raid bosses. So please, by all means, continue, tell me how 11k hp full melee  light armor class requires less organization, planning and communication on dhuum than rene or mirage (or even it's condi counterpart). While doing less damage. Sorry, but while you love for weaver is admirable, it just doesn't fit some places (both dhuum and openworld), and you should try and get some other, more appropriate tools for that. Or play what you like, but dont talk about efficiency.
---
And for the main discourse, it didn't move anywhere yet. Just for a reminder: raid builds are made with the assumption of boons/buffs and conditions on the target, often lose a lot offensive effectivness if these requirements aren't met, starting to drag behind builds that are made with self-buffing in mind.
---
Yeah, and then you'll get a base warrior, a non-druid ranger (can't have healing spring under water, because reasons), three daredevils and your condi cleanses will be way below what afflicted + bonus condies can apply :P also "optimized groups"... We're talking pugs here :( I don't really want to go fractals without static any more.
---
This basically screams same as siren's Reef: bring all scourge party and don't worry about anything. But if you don't have enough conversion you're fucked.
---
It's a skill based game instead of p2w one. Idk why and how anyone would enjoy being able to clear everything while meaninglessly spamming random buttons.
---
Aquatic fractal exists on lower difficulties as well so if you don't enjoy being rekt by AI you can always play something easier.
---
It might be an issue with underwater boon strip on its own tho -- veteran jellyfish during the swim part were troublesome to boonstrip as well.
---
i got 2 infusions from ab so far, i would say its worth it. and i just hop on to loot chests in between dps raid q’s in ff14
---
You have legendary armour and legendary weapons? I got a stroke when I saw what I needed to do to get legendary armour, but I wvw so maybe it’s harder there
---
Having the cream of the crap isn't saying much.
---
All wells work underwater but chronos :) ain't that fun :) When they changed scrapper's gyros to be wells, they also made it usable underwater so they've just ignored chrono wells for 0 reason.
---
If you have nvidia graphics card you can just use shadowplay it's pretty simple.
---
its free money , skillwise level is the lowest of the ERP so the chances of wining if you are half decent are biggen than ever and the price is way bigger than before.
---
If you a hardcore player and still playing the game not participating  to get literally free money is kinda dumb
---
I run mirror images instead of defender because clone generation uw spear is meh at best (and with this new bullshit IP removal, it gets harder to split/shatter your stuff) and defender's cooldown is still too high to be worth it. It also can be useful as a stun break ;D
---
i think it could be a programming mistake, maybe something related to their spawn. i dont know what the flash looks like but if you say its barely noticeable then its higher chance of being a bug
---
So many people just ignore the instabilities and don't change up some utilities to counter them...
---
Thank you. I'll try to look at weaver again, it may be what I need now.
---
Be specific? PvP because it gets no updates, WvW for the same reason as well as probably just not being people's cup of tea. But I think we're missing my original point here - I agree that MMO players are motivated by rewards, and I'm saying they do so to the point that they don't care if they're having fun so long as they get compensated for the time they spent not having fun
---
Are those on the same weekly cooldown as the level 10 one? I've never paid attention.
---

Can try here to
---
Cheap? Yes. worth the gold? Most likely not. 
---
I mean you use it on 2 things most of time. One is fractal and other is krait daily if you do such things.
---
 So basically one thing.
---
It's cheaper to have asc or exotic one. The difference on the effort it reduces isn't amazing. Who changes UW stats anyway?
---
WOW, 2s, and I thought I was poor
---
Well honestly Anet made it by their inability to communicate in any reasonable manner. Alongside with failed promises of PoF as content rich expansion, constant delay of new releases, coupled with lack of quality polish for long awaited features, and existing systems.
---
I am pretty sure that this autumn with 95% guarantee would be the last for my 14 year adventure in Guild Wars franchise.
---
Other 5% is in hope that we would get release date for WvW rebalance, we would get new expansion after season 5, and season 5 would be way more beefier than previous iterations, coupled with actual fractal and raid releases.
---
No to a fucking mobile app the 100th time! No one wants it only the people who get bored of the game after 5mins... if you want to talk to guildie download discoed? Make a guild channel????? There you go!
---
Hello, good. I'm Plate Of Steak
---
Hard content should be done for the challenge, not the rewards. The most rewarding game I’ve played was shadow of the colossus climbing the main tower; there is no positive reward for doing that.
---
Have you tried using cleanses and resistance?
---
Clearing hard content nowadays is kinda braindeda considering that you can skip everything with aegis spam from fb or even heal scourge. 
---
Adapting is what people struggle with and since discretize/snowcrows dont have guides and optimal compositions for underwater content I'm not surprised that people are clueless about what to do.
---
&gt;  I love this game unlike most any I've ever played but a breaking point comes for everyone at some point.
---
Yep.  It's nice we're more or less in the last week of waiting, but I've stopped gaming almost entirely.  Once you start breaking your MMO habits it becomes progressively easier to stop logging in for weekly raids, daily fractals, guild missions -- whatever.
---
They’re the cheapest yet go under the category of “I’m rich, you know”
---
Hi, super cool. I actually did one run, and your trick worked for me, I managed to go through completely in one go
---
It is the best out of any mmo, but it still isn’t as good as it could be
---
&gt; Just for clarity: Gambling is the act of using money on an event with an uncertain outcome **and a negative expected value.**
---
This is not under the definition anywhere.
---
Gambling is just the first half, Negative expected value is nothing to do with it.
---
Investing is still a gamble. Like gambling when you bet on a horse for example, As you are making an educated guess.
---
A game of pure chance is also gambling, Investing is not a game of chance. Lootboxs however are.
---
Both are still gambles.
---
It is when people don’t have a breather and green weapons equipped
---
Tbh the boss was boring and faceroll. I think they even tried to change its mechanics a few times before, but I never even knew what they did because the boss died fast anyway.
---
&gt;wear gear for stats, dodge shit, don't stand in shit, and have traits that work well with each other.
---
Yes this. Most people DONT do this. A good portion of the playerbase is actually this bad. Hell, I'm watching training run stream on twitch the streamer that's raiding that cant even keep the boss targetted to auto attack it constantly. Like I said the game does a terrible job of teaching you because standing in shit and taking damage usually has no real consequences because you can res rush a boss. Yhe actual damage you take is low and you can go in full toughness gear and be ok. In all of the other games the base skill bar isnt set so low. In ff14 you're forced to do instances as you level which have introduce you to instanced content so you're not immensely clueless about your class when you hit max level.
---
Having the best trash is still trash but I get the point you're making.
---
^^^ too many people equate time spent to difficulty. You’re totally right.
---
Because this is a game and not real life? Because living or dying depends on money whereas hard content in a game has no relation to mortality. The whole point of challenging yourself is to get better, not get better shinies. Also, harder content in real life doesn’t necessarily mean better rewards either so my idea gets fortified when your comparison is made. Think sanitary worker vs senator. Both deal with shit every day but one pays a lot less and does a lot more work.
---
Granted, although they could have kept going for likewise legitimate reasons. I mean, nothing is without compromise, and the best work doesn't have to be the easy work. You can't please everyone, but if you try to please the more discerning audience, I think that usually leads to a better product and most people ultimately come around. It would continue to give GW2 something no other game can boast and would have made all content patches something to truly anticipate. Yes they'd have to structure quests in such a way that they either work along the changes to the world, or aren't so important they need to stick around, or whatever. There's a lot to consider. But that's why they're professional game designers and developers and get paid to solve those kinds of problems.
---
Exactly the reason to be worry. Is Anet trying to be GGG or ED by rolling constant stream of content?
---
They would fail on schedule, would produce half baked and lackluster product with new shiny gemstore things.
---
Meanwhile it is safe to say that both expansions were very decent releases. Going away from expansion model would be death sentence for Anet.
---
Looks like Main acct character they named "Spottermelon" is either long deleted or renamed...if she was renamed it might could be the one with the most playtime, but I don't remember if that was her old name or not. Same is true of the other account, they name they sent it to no longer exists as the character was renamed. Seems dead named characters still retain their old name somewhere in the system?
---
Because getting good does not translate to gameplay necessarily. Sometimes it means improving your self-focus or motivational brain chemistry through neuroplastic means. Sometimes it means developing a good work ethic. I enjoy jumping puzzles as an awareness test for myself about how fast I can go and still pay enough attention to not mess up. It is not entirely about in-game concepts. You play challenging content to get good, that is the point; you don’t do it for the rewards because the reward is getting good.
---
&gt;  ...it’s a 100% skip for me now
---
So you have others that are 100% skips for you or is it just the new uw fractal?
---
Pressing F and running in circles is not new content. Everything new after layoffs is just half baker recycled products.
---
core (1-80 and the personal story during this period) is like one big tutorial/school for the rest of the game.  As such it's rather easy while it's slowly ramping you up on your skills, builds, and knowledge of base game mechanics.  You can basically faceroll most missions without much strategy.  Dungeons force you to be a lot more active in combat in terms of movement/placement.  Even then the story paths are fairly straightforward.  Living World Season 2 and onward provide a bigger challenge in comparison because you are expected to have a fair foundation to build off of once you get to that point.  
---
as far as more active classes, they are all fairly active depending on build.  if you want more raw mechanical involvement you might consider ele, engi, mesmer, or thief.
---
But you may be right here after all since for the other accts I have it is all the character with the most playtime.
---
Thanks! I must've tried the wrong characters; seems it's very selective as to which characters are allowed. Ø/Å along with *most* characters using ~ (õã) aren't allowed, æ and â/ä (including other vowels using the same accents) are allowed. TIL the naming system's *weird af*...
---
Exactly. I’m download wow classic now but tbh I don’t expect much from wow combat...
---
This is such a stupid argument, these business models revolve in a very small percentage of the population spending insanes amount of money, so it's not that impactful if the majority of people buy them or not, the biggest amount of money by far is coming from whales and that's who they want to target. It's why these business models suck, it makes money on people that have lots of disposable income or are not very mentally sane (or unchecked kids using their parents credit card), while fucking over the majority of the playerbase that's only confortable in spending 5-10$ per month at most
---
we failed with 2 different fbs and than with druid,ppl usualy died in last phase when you have to kill 2 champs and you get perma dots on you. its just not worth the effort,90% ppl dont know their underwater skills and this whole RUSH OR DIE mentality in GW 2  doesnt help either.
---
Other than animations you should learn how the various classes work anyway so you know how to counter them. It also helps with your evaluation of opponents. If you know how easy or difficult it is to pull off whatever they just hit you with it will give you a more accurate assessment of their skill.
---
I also got that email it was addressed to a character name I haven't used in 2 or 3 years.
---
Now see you're saying this to me as if I'm personally crashing your groups, which... I'm not. I have no real GW2 raid experience because I'm not lying and crashing groups I don't meet the obnoxious requirements for. 
---
&gt; So IDK where you get the idea other MMOs don't do training.
---
No other game has the insufferable 'training guilds' that GW2 does. I never said that there isn't training, I said specifically 'training guilds'. You can queue for raid training alone and be automatically accepted if your gear passes the minimum requirement, you don't have to ping LI or commit to someone's cult of culture or fill out a application/personality test to get into a group. Plus since mentioning this you should also probably mention that even this function becomes worthless the further you are separated into an expac, because less people are willing to queue for helping people train for a boss that has been outclassed 3 Turns ago.
---
I'd settle for a bugfix for Almorra's Directive these days.
---
Maybe the rule is characters from supported languages? Can't test right now but if you can use ß then probably it's the rule
---
Definitely. I will argue that is unhealthy behavior. I found myself doing the same thing and I was chasing a carrot on a stick. I realized I was not playing for fun, but rather playing to get a reward. Not entirely comparable, but my league of legends gameplay improved dramatically when I switched from wanting rewards (winning) to just generally appreciating playing and having fun.
---
I'm always a little bit surprised, and impressed when I see just how damn well they managed to do mounts.  I thought they'd be clunky trash, but they're just so smooth, and amazing, it's a shame they weren't in the game from the start.
---
&gt; It's only a spammy mess if you don't really understand the combat. 
---
Similar to button mashing in a fighting game versus a skilled player. :)
---
&gt; Citation needed.
---
1. go to any raid vent thread
---
2. read comments

inb4 "but dogpiling is not harassment"
---
Problem with the loot bags is that the materials in there aren't worth anything
---
And if you play on a server with k/d rate below 1.00 you even hardly get those bags that aren't worth anything.
---
Pet nerf on druid was warranted because it was the only healer that also did half decent damage.
---
As for druid being in a bad spot that's true.
---
Frankly they should just normalize/share some of the unique buffs across different specs so that who you take for what job is more about that person's skill instead of "We have to have X buff"
---
The combat system is definitely wasted on most the game's content. :/
---
Correction, I play content for the enjoyment and that is why I am not playing GW2.
---
Did it with guildies in tier 4 just 10 minutes ago and as a Mirage I used Null Field and Shattered Concentration to rip all the boons off. Easy
---
Whether I keep playing or quit for good, will depend entirely on what is announced on the overhyped live stream.
---
&gt; thinly veiled
---
Look, the subreddit learned a new phrase!
---
I wouldn't mind something in addition to GW2.
---
I like Guild Wars. Even they made a mobile game, and it was entirely it's own thing. SE did this in Japan with FFXI. They released a little F2P game based on the XI universe. I wouldn't mind a way to play something GW when I'm out and about, chilling in bed, watching TV, etc. I think there are things that could connect two games in cool ways. Things to unlock new skins or other rewards back and forth. If they brought a bigger guild focus to GW2, there could be stuff you could do on the mobile game, that helped the guild in both games, and vice versa.
---
A companion app would be great too. Just a way to manage things without having to log in would be nice. Most of these end up being petty useless, but I'd hardly be against it.
---
A lot of this is just reactionary though. A mobile game could work. It's just everyone would hear "mobile game" and then just take it as GW2 is dead. As long as the PC version is still supported, I don't really care what else Anet works on. As long as the main game doesn't suffer.
---
I don't think they are making a mobile game though.
---
yeah, wow is in a better spot 😂
---
Yep, and it's good because it gives newer players a chance to see if this game mode is for them or not. Like myself, just did a match where a holo camped our near almost the entire match.  Couldn't dislodge him 2v1 or even when a 3rd came to help after 1 had been defeated.  The entire match.
---
I'm new to sPvP, but not to GW2, and if that is what I see in unranked?  Yeah, I'll just use sPvP when I need to cap a quick daily or 2.   By comparison WvW at least is balanced since everyone is stupidly OP.
---
Not really. It's more of a sudden mega-nerf to ability to do that fractal. Players didn't change, it's just 10 times harder to get the same exact loot, because pro players are irritated at having pugs play in T4s, I guess?. Pugs were doing it before, nothing changed on their side but now thanks to "upgrade" they get kicked in the nuts and moved down into T3. Because some people whined that it was too easy _for them_ so _everyone else_ has to suffer consequences.
---
If raids got the same make-over and only groups within 10% of snow crows DPS could easily do them now, there'd be massive screaming. And people would be mad when someone would suggest to do CM fractals instead (hey, two groups of 5, both doing own fractal -- neat!). But making unorganized suboptimal pug groups suffer more and more in fractals -- totally fine. Endgame content should be harder! Where.
---
My mouse broke a few years back and this was the issue i was having. Replacing the mouse fixed it.
---
Maybe, if you happen to have a second mouse, try it for a while see it that fixes it.
---
I'm not sure we're really saying the same thing here -- When you bet on a horse, your expected value is negative; if the people betting had a positive expected return, the bookies would lose money every race and would quickly go out of business.  That's why it's gambling.
---
When you purchase a stock, the expected return is positive.  There's a risk that it might not, but overall you're more likely to end up with more value than you started.  That's why it's investing, not gambling.
---
There are still people in this thread arguing that a studio of 200 would "waste time and resources". Because obviously reddit knows best that anet knows best not to waste time and resources, like on those side projects that made 25% of the company get sacked by NC Soft. Oh wait, that actually happened. Turns out those "resources" aren't exactly as scarce as backseat gamedevs from reddit make them to be.
---
Insert indie game developer meme here.
---
Meanwhile, you "waste resources" all the time. Vendors lie, dependencies are undocumented, hardware fails, features get cut mid sprint, bugs need to get reproduced, testing gets redone, you implement things wrong, surprise maintenance of a decade old codebase motherfucker, third party takes a week to reply, clients change their mind, new legislation needs to be implemented, entire modules get scrapped...
---
&gt; It is about the rewards.
---
Your words, not mine.
---
Meanwhile ive been running stat infusions on my breather and trident just for this fractal
---
Likely because they didn't have time to rework 
---
Mirage. I mean, they disabled Chaotic Interruption like a week after the patch instead of fixing it with the patch.
---
&gt; Doing the same fucking fractals day in day out for seven years, it's really nice to be able to veg out for one of them. 
---
Agreed. Old aquatic will be missed.
---
I actually kinda like this rework (please don't kill). It still suffers from underwater combat being janky af, but it's much better than the garbage that is Siren's Reef. We had one wipe prior to this recording (I also forgot to equip boon stripping), but went mostly okay for our first run. What I didn't enjoy was being absolutely destroyed as a Dolphin in one hit by a Krait.
---
Underwater combat isn't my thing and I tend to fumble my inputs a lot, sometimes I want to go forward and accidentally end up going like 100 miles backwards. Today's instabilities for this fractal was absolute garbage, Vengeance and No Pain, No Gain do *not* go well together in this fractal as it stands. 
---
I'd expect a bug fix for the music changing to that boring dungeon track after respawning after having reached the boss room, but it's still present. (please fix anet)
---
Nothing. Anet loves mirage. They won't change it. But IF they change something I guess they will remove superspeed on dodge because it makes up for the lack of movement on dodge.

I personally haven't seen a lot of examples of people being accused of being racists simply because they posted the wrong emoji. What actually happens is that people keyed into these memes generally also recognize the context when it's actually being used by racists, while ordinary people just don't pick up on it at all. No one should feel like they have to avoid certain emojis (or dye their milk black :P) just because someone might incorrectly think they're Nazis.
---
To put it another way, a glass of milk is not racist… A glass of milk emoji followed by an OK sign emoji in response to a Trump tweet about closing the border might be a tad racist.
---
There is no base damage for direct damage abilities in the game, so you can compare them just by their scaling values, 4.84 vs 3.75. The "base damage" on the wiki is a standardized calculation with 1000 Power and wielding an Exotic version of that weapon against a target with 2597 Armor, since this is what the tooltips would show in game. The scaling is everything; if you somehow had 0 Power, there would be no base damage, they wouldn't do any damage at all. This is different from condition damage and healing, both of which do have base values at 0 Condition Damage and 0 Healing, respectively.
---
What if I told you it *is* that simple as "just implement difficulty modes"?
---
*looks at fractals*
---
What if I told you all issues that eventually arise can be ironed out?
---
What if I told you they can just... change things if they are badly received?
---
Oh yeah, but that requires having a cohesive plan of action instead of releasing a series of fire-and-forget themepark one-offs that get rendered obsolete faster than you can spell "bit rot".
---
What alliance are you in and why were the cyno changes the last straw?
---
Also I don’t think chrono has been the same between 3 consecutive patches in the last year. I stopped playing around a year ago and got less and less excited about returning after each change to the spec
---
I doubt my computer would load fast enough.
---
It's not unhealthy, it's just a different mindset.
---
As long as people are playing, I don’t see that as a problem.
---
Mine is 14yo but it also runs dx12 and win 10. dx9 is just too old.
---
There's also another free one from the HoT personal story. It's quite far in, but you only need to do the story up to the point of entering Tangled Depths and then one instance there that is very close to the entrance of the zone.
---
Not sure they would keep it running if revenue dried up as most players move to the new game. As far as I read in a 2013 interview GW1 has a fraction of GW2's server cost, so the same model might not work for it.
---
&gt; "[GW1] itself was so efficient on the server side in terms of the resources, like, it runs on a fraction of the hardware that we need for running Guild Wars 2, so having that on the back-burner is nothing compared to GW2."
---

---
Then I worded it like shit. It is about intrinsic rewards, not material rewards.
---
I understand optimization,  it's how we got dungeon runs to take 2 seconds back in the day.  But this is just trivialization.
---
Nah Anet is clearly doing something with mesmer/mirage given that CI is still disabled. And they already removed superspeed from mirage cloak; now you only get a +66% move speed buff.
---
This is why my first legendary rune went into my aqua breather
---
I just did a map completion last week and the gryphon is very niche. There were like 2 times when ir was actually worth using.
---
Same for beetle. 
---
Jackson+skyscale does everything too well to bother with anything else.
---
What about something like league of legends? I have literally all the champs and skins I want and a metric ton of currency; I don’t have anything to work towards except generally getting better at the game and yet I still play it. The problem is thinking there is nothing to show for it when there are a lot of developed skills along the way. It reminds me of that stereotype of a poor person buying an 80k Cadillac because they have insecurity issues and need to look cool with material objects.
---
I agree that underwater as a whole should be looked at (Camera jank, general movement speed, and skills not translating to underwater specifically), but that would happen in several increments, not all at once. "we shouldn't fix one part of a thing if the rest don't get fixed at the same time!" is not a good mindset for approaching change.
---
It can’t get any worse; they most likely make too much money from gems-to-gold for the economy to ever feel good. In FFXIV, you can pretty much make money and get rich doing any single thing you enjoy, in GW2 you have to abandon the game and play the market to get filthy stupid rich.
---
I don't know about you but in my cases it has been the mouse.
---
CI deserved to be removed in its current form.
---
No one forces you to farm easy mode, the same way no one forces you to camp Istan to farm gold.
---
Then first fix uw combat before changing content. btw no announcement has been made they are going to change it ever, so why should I assume they will?
---
I quit before Cata, but when I came back for a few months during Legion, I did get a chance to play that underwater level.  Yeah, WoW's underwater combat, as far as I remember, was just above ground combat under water. Nothing was different, and therefore, nothing was tailored to work in a 3rd environment.  It wasn't that engaging.
---
To GW2's credit, they have specific weapons, and thus, different 1-5 abilities for underwater combat.  That still doesn't justify having a sizeable portion of utility abilities locked out while underwater.  It is what I meant by 'half-assed'.  Sure they have put way more attention to it than other MMOs, but while a half-rotten apple is arguably better than a fully rotten one, I still wouldn't enjoy eating it.
---
What is easy for you, isn't easy for others.
---
Is it that hard to understand, really?
---
They shouldn't rework an entire elite spec because of raids.
---
Congratz! Welcome to the club.
---
Pretty much this.
---
TLDR: Yes.  They can't afford to let some stats and skills work for some encounters because it would render the whole thing moot.  
---
They have designed themselves into a corner where the only options are to do a massive system overhaul or to force players to face fight mechanics by rendering all defenses against them useless.  The first one is a money and time issue, they simply won't.  The second actually forces players to perform the encounter the way their original vision for GW2 said it should be, watching your screen instead of your skillbar/cooldowns, but instead makes an encounter alien to all the people who believe in what their skills claim to do.  This is one of the reasons, IMO, people have trouble getting into SPvP and WvW;  The skills and stats sometimes act totally backwards compared to PvE because a PvE player expects things to work in certain ways that just don't apply when facing another player.  
---
E.g. Ranger LB2, last I checked, was damn near a 1 shot vs another player, and currently, FINALLY after many years, might do ~%50 damage vs many newer trash mobs (Shadow Army, Branded etc).
---
Considering they were stated to be trying to avoid the balance nightmares of GW1's many thousands of skill combinations, they shot themselves in the foot when somebody had the bright idea to add the traditional MMO element of stats on gear.  In short, they created a scenario where they would eventually have to nerf player abilities based on builds that were only possible because of certain stat combinations...  Or nerf the stats which would be many times worse since stats are the entire gold and time sink cost in your build.
---
They made the next massive mistake in designing the combat and character balance around SPvP (5 vs 5, level 78 exotic gear on level 80 characters at the time, etc.) and then throwing a thousand wrenches into the whole system with their PvE designs.  Mob ranks (vet, elite etc),  Over-leveled and underleveled mobs, dispropotionately applied dynamic scaling (like Crown Pavilion but also most of LS1), and then they bent the combat system completely out of whack to make original dungeon bosses like Giganticus Lupicus and later raids that focus a group on one target for a long time which undermines the escence of that fast paced and chaotic SPvP experience they designed the game around.  This also forced them to find ways to make it so that a PvE boss can 1 shot players to enforce mechanics like timers etc, which led to the Zerk meta, because defence was pointless... And still is in many cases.  Later with Elite specs they added skills with the ability to render even those kinds of mechanics moot, so the balance team has been left chasing ghosts with tools that aren't necessarily able to fix the actual sources of some problems and the only answer is for encounter designers to render defence useless.
---
FYI, according to gw2efficiency, total account is about 97+k to 200+k(when I viewed the page) and Play For Free is about 1.4+k to 3.2+k.

Have fun clicking for hours. Not worth the time investment.
---
Fractal convergence on Snowblind and Uncategorized is a good example of fights that are just a shitshow.
---
I wouldn't mind it if the boss fights got harder, if there were new mechanics to learn or if i had to dodge perfectly... what i do mind is that for a lot of these instabilities there is no counterplay other than "Pray to RNGesus".
---
"Oh, i see you've dodged twice and avoided ALL damage from the boss, here take this maw tentacle swipe to the face and get yeeted off the arena to your death."

And I don't camp istan to farm gold so stop making assumptions.
---
&gt;  respecting champ trains

imagine being so entitled to use this phrase unironically
---
boy this game would suck donkey balls if it didn't actively counteract getting griefed by organized groups.
---
Imo T4 shouldn't be easy.   
---
T1-T2 fit that role.   
---
I think the rework is pretty ok.
---
All I see is piss-poor salt with nothing to back up.
---
Yeah bro I’m just a gw2 bittervet but starting is genuinely a good time. Be wary of the endgame though.
---
Never say...
---
&gt; GG to be a sport
---
...when you win by a landslide.
---
That's just being an asshole...unless you're really that ignorant.
---
This has nothing to do with GW2, but every single competitive mode, game, and sport - it's basic common sense...which apparently isn't so common.
---
WoW has PTR, but I guess for GW2 the technology isn't there yet.
---
There has been a pretty big patch for underwater content about half year ago.   
---
It added bunch of new translated skills(for example rangers traps)
---
So what, uw combat is still a mess.
---
Anet is a company, not a girl. You wont get laid in exchange for random compliments.
---
No thanks I’m taken
---
I've had the character at level 80 since the base game, just I never tried weaver until recently due to taking a long break from the game and only returning a couple months ago. The class isn't new to me, just the differences from weaver to the base elementalist and tempest are throwing me off big time, especially since the build I wanted to try uses weapons I never previously bothered with
---
Hey, + 10 points for Touhou remix as background music :)
---
What I dont like about this fractal is that the spin attack cannot be avoided if you're a melee guy (could be stopped by a breakbar for instance) and the tells are not very good, especially for the cage attack. 
---
Outside of that the boss is fine.
---
Lol, what? Black Lion Chests are way worse, you generally get garbage from them. The Hunting Bonds at least exclusively give you gem store unlocks. If you don't like them, don't buy them. I assume they'll stay because they'll sell, no matter if Reddit whines about it or not.
---
How fast is the LS2 key? I don't think I've ever bothered anything outside the level 40 one.
---
Besides the camera, which I don't know what exactly your problems with it are, everything else has been addressed. Some of the worst classes (that barely had any available skills UW) were worked on, and the new UW infusions give you some nice extra move speed.
---
So the problem might lie with how rewards in GW2 are handled. Time/gold gated collections to extend content is extremely lazy because they do not have the man power that something like Lol does. Lol makes it so you don't have to work for rewards (with the exception of the recent battle passes), you just have to play the game and you passively get rewarded. GW2 has an ACTIVE reward system that makes you pursue your goals by pushing you outside of things you enjoy doing. Imagine if the system was like League where playing gave you a universal currency where you could buy outfits, mounts, gathering tools, and other items in a REASONABLE amount of time without opening your wallet. Maybe the problem is not the reward behaviors themselves, but the way rewards are handed out. A game should be a form of enjoyment, not a chore with timetables. I realize this segues from my original point, but I really want to figure out why GW2 became so trash after raids and outfits became a thing.
---
Yay i can wield the Dreamer!
---
I don't think you understand why it is that way.
---
Also, if the number there is what bothers you so much, then prepare to pop some blood vessels. Call your doctor and pre-book for a check up, cause surely your pressure is going to rise.

Relationships are not a transaction. If your assumption is that you've earned something from a woman for giving them a compliment, you're going to have a very unhappy life.

Im not complementing women. Or men. I also have no sexual desires.
---
&gt;My opinion is really unpopular
---
=not qualitatively analyzable. Definitely quantitatively though.
---
I thought there was a sale now on both expansions for the price of one
---
nice hot take on something you have no clue about.
---
Do you want volatility to drop after placements or something like that?
---
GW2 has a shitton of passive rewards as well. League has its own set of active rewards. 
---
And now you're just going on a personal rant. Raids singlehandedly saved the game to me because they finally introduced actually fun content. The game really hasn't changed much in any other way, except that it recently really went to shit with fucking over fractals with random instabilities and a terrible release rate for every mode that's not open world.
---
The match was close, i dont think we won by a landslide. I say GG in all the games i play, im not sure why it would be a mean thing to do, even when the opposing team wins by a landslide, i still say gg. I guess im ignorant.
---
If you arent raiding viper doesnt matter. Run what you want in open world. You are missing some big story from HoT btw. And the best meta farm and amazing classes
---
its clearly broken,boss have aoe dmg while invu,hitting for basicly nothing,BUT it proc condi affix = whole pt  20 stacks of condi in 10 sec.
---
Hah, I'll remember that for when I dare attempt to play rank pvp again
---
I don’t see any flashessss I keep replaying the video
---
No, it objectively worse. They fucked an entire class and continue to screw it up to this day.
---
And all you care to say about that is "Durr, things change. You need to learn to accept change."
---
No, unlike you, I don't accept every piece of shit handed to me.
---
And there you go about the community again. Shut up about the stupid community. The community is fucking the game over because people like you accept everything they're given no matter how shitty.
---
Oh yes, I'm sure you're existence is very valuable to this game as you're part of the mindless community that defends Anets actions of turning the game to shit.
---
The game is objectively worse. For someone who's constantly telling me to accept change, you certainly have a hard time ADAPTING to that OBJECTIVE FACT.
---
When you do upgrade, keep in mind you get a free wvw server transfer when buying the xpacs.
---
Row 5 is impossible.
---
Row 4 is the most likely imo.
---
It's a really simple process. Simply look for the crossed sword icon at the top of your screen. Click on it an click "Ranked Arena". As long as the League season is active, you'll make tons of money and you can pretend that it's a small-scale WvW engagement. Then you can go back to idling in a camp while you wait for the next queue to pop.
---
I, for one, wish for this. But at the same time they will have to add new weapons available underwater and make sure everything can be used underwater or have an underwater version (traits, skills, etc.). We need a huge QoL and balance patch with any new underwater content but I seriously think it's a huge untapped potential.
---
This should be a separate thread.
---
&gt; It is common courtesy to say "Good game" at the end of every match whether you win or lose. No matter what.
---
I disagree, if they have a DC its disrespectful imo.
---
most people say "sorry for your dc."
---
Not that I would whisper someone for it though lol
---
Still, metabattle open world builds are mostly minmaxed for tagging mobs or such.
---
Dyable legendary raid armor aura? Can't do that.
---
The life with no weak auras is hard. I wish there was a better way to display important buffs and debuffs aswell
---
Nah, the community is really not that polarized at all due to the presence of challenging content. If anything content related polarized the community it was dungeons when people where rejected purely for the class they played or their AP instead of actual performance. 
---
Raid pugs are hit or miss in any game, FFXIV and GW2 included. What's actually polarizing the community is ANets lack of communication, shit release schedule of anything but open world and the constant accusations and insults thrown towards entire playerbases of gamemodes, mostly by a group of toxic casuals.
---
What also contributes to it is the mentality of a part of the playerbase that just cannot understand not all content is catered to them. They want everything nerfed or the mode specific rewards handed to them, instead of actually playing or learning that content.
---
then why are you playing gw2 and not FFXIV if you like it more?
---
It is not that we want all content to be about us, it is that we want all the cosmetics to be obtainable through any means, casual or otherwise, besides being gated behind a community we want no part of. Raid pugs in FFXIV worked because you are stuck with the group you get or face a penalty, group comps are guaranteed 1 healer, 1 tank, 2 dps or 2 tank, 2 healer, 4 dps, and the content is generally simple to work through while hard content is 100% optional and only rewards tiny little things like a 10 gearscore increase (which is only important for min/maxers).
---
I've actually been playing GW2 on and off since 2013. I played the he'll out of GW1. GW2 has become one of those f2p games that I can always come back to and things have changed/updated. Recently I caught up on the living world story, and I still need to get my skyscale. I've also never done a raid in GW2 and don't gave any legendaries. I have a lot to do still, not to mention that I am rediscovering the game vicariously through my dudes that are just rolling in. About 95% of my play time is on one character, so learning how other classes/builds work has been a real slice
---
I always liked the underwater combat, I wish wow had combat and underwater combat like GW2, such a genius design to let you get completely new skills by changing weapons.
---
Big diff between just a simple "gg" and rubbing it with a "ggez".
---
Yeah I don't either. I just seems like there's a LOT of negative feelings toward something that started as just a suggestion.
---
&gt;Feb 2018, and have since logged about 3.4k
---
How
---
Im a veteran and idk what Diviner Ele is because all you have to do is press ‘1’ in this game.
---
Thank you, this shows how little I know how it works. I'm not a troll; I just sign on and play. I might have been confused with EQ2 as when I played on my own for free I couldn't use the auction house, etc. I do have it under my email now.
---
Just play ff14 dude
---
What do you think this would be good for?
---
First one apparently.
---
Fractal t4 HAHA sorry sorry
---
Define "Ele"
---
Diviner Tempest? Yeah, that could absolutely work. Tempest has the best Might/Fury granting skill in the whole game. I prefer Harrier's, though.
---
Core Ele or Weaver? No.
---
You shoulda worded the title as a PSA to get upvotes.
---
hahah! here i was craving gw2 today, thanks for fixing that again, much appreciated
---
I think many people confuse length with difficulty. Shattered Observatory (specially CM) is technically harder and longer, but it's much more fun and most people do it like it's nothing. Siren's Reef is technically easier and shorter, but it's so bad and un-fun that it gets perceived as hard.
---
(Though SR's last boss is more rough than hard due to how bad it is)
---
Delightfully tacky in all the best ways.
---
Thanks everyone, i guess i will just stick to diviner chrono
---
Thanks!
---
Dios means god in spanish and can be used the exact same way. Source: native speaker.
---
So please don't go saying nonsense if you don't know what you are talking about.
---
I simply played my alacrene and used malyxx all the way, so my entire group had permanent resistance. was a very easy run (we had a heal qb tho)
---
thanks mate
---
thx
---
I use heal scourge to carry the downs, barriers for condition clear, and boon corrupt for boon strip.
---
what is ess?  
---
if its the 100 kp. then these people were propably faking their kp. or are just terribly bad
---
&gt; worth the gold? Most likely not.
---
The spear is magnificent imho, and you can bug out its aura to persist overland. 200% worth it, can recommend. No gold cost is too much for that kind of fashion. The other two are meh, despite some ok special effects. Only bother if you're an underwater freak or if you feel like gambling on the distant future and going all HAHA I TOLD YOU SO the day we get an UW expansion and the cost skyrockets. Or both.
---
Fishbump?
---
what armor pieces?
---
But he didn’t ask you a question...joke only works if he includes the “?”
---
Oh wow, I'll have to keep that one in mind for an alt. I have or have had Fishbone, Fishbane, Fishmane, Fishgut and others, but no Fishbump yet!
---
Agree with this point. Playing unranked is weird because you have no idea how good your opponents really are. In ranked you will eventually settle into a bracket with people around your skill level.
---
Reqium
---
jeah thats ranked  in any game out there tbh.
---
I write  "have a nice game" and similar stuff at the start of every game and "gg" at the end of every game.  in 1 out of 10 games I get a positive response  at the start of a game, 1 negative (or maybe simply troll) respond, but most of the games people simply ignore it.
---
but well at the end of a game people get really upset if they feel like they got totally destroyed and tend to flame gg-sayers, maybe because they think you want to make a joke on them. I dont know, but honestly I dont care. I will continue trying to be nice all the time.
---
Oh, and one game was real strange, I started the game with "enjoy your game guys", and then suddenly one of my teammate hit me up when the game was around 200/200 and told me to stop being toxic and stuff, dont know what was going on inside of him :D
---
I actually currently don't use Touhou music with my custom playlists, but went to youtube due to the boss music breaking.
---
Also Idolatrize World is so good.
---
Veteran? Really 2 week old reddit account a veteran? Yeah right.
---
What's up with the wow fan boys spreading hate in this subreddit through new accounts. Are you so desperate to get more people that you have to do this?
---
All you did in this last two weeks was  starting drama and spreading misinfo...aaand claiming wow classic will kill gw2. Woops seems like someone from the wow community forgot to switch accounts back...
---
Negativ karma didn't think that's possible.
---
everyone needs to read this thx
---
Of course I enjoyed stomping the other team and winning by a landslide.
---
Hm. Thanks for the information :D
---
Ah. I thought there are some timers, well will try to check it:)
---
I never see any flashes,  me and my gf focusing each on one side and none of us has seen any flash in 25 runs, by now.
---
the only thing that appears, is that the platform are loading, so I see them spawning
---
EXACTLY!!
---
I have had that, but years ago. Do not remember how I managed to fix it, or if it just went away on its own.
---
Also it only happened while in guild wars.
---
&gt; The GW2 raiding community demands min-maxing harder than any other  gaming community I've played, and I think part of that is because it has  horizontal progression.
---
GW2 is more aimed towards casual play. To increase the chance of succeeding, people need to overcome a bigger gap which some players will see as min-maxing. If you look at the hardcore community in any game there will be min-maxing big time, but the gap between what people are used to and what is min-maxed isn't as big for most of the other games.  
---
Most people don't really demand min-maxed gear(not one pug I joined in EU ever demanded infusions for example)...if you're 6-8k under the numbers to aim for most groups won't even bother saying anything about it (depending on the boss) even though that can be 33% of the damage that is done in an optimal situation (loads of raiders say if you're at 80% of the benchmarks you're more then fine, being fine with missing 20% isn't min-maxing). So the min-maxing isn't as bad as you state in my experience. Altough I don't know how it is in NA.   
---
&gt; but there's this constant notion of "Be full ascended and be a  MetaBattle build and have the best food ready to go, ye old fucking  scrub" 
---
Using builds that are proven to do their part of the job isn't a bad idea...as people come up with horrible stuff where their contribution ends up being neglectable, or them being there even having a negative influence on the fight.  
---
I barely ever see a group asking for gear ping. Having the best food ready is part of preperation. If people can't be bothered to spend 1 gold on food people are most likely not gonna bother preparing for a raid in general which reduces the chance of succeeding.
---
&gt;cries in Weaver main
---
Same casual PvP player here.  I think I understand what you're looking for because I've considered the same, but I don't think there is a suitable data-based method.  In ranked play, you're only as good or better than the people you're playing against (and often with, too).  So, you can't *really* win 18 out of 20 matches and claim with confidence that you're a great player.  Same with losses, as I'm sure everyone can attest to.
---
Instead, I think the answer may be more subjective.  Some of the things that make a player skillful don't always result in wins or even points on the board.  Reading enemy team compositions, observing skill use, recognizing patterns, NOT tunnel-visioning, and the like are the things that separate me from really good players.  I suck at these things big time, and it shows when I play against players that don't.
---
Keeping those things in mind help me in evaluating my skill level.  No one likes to admit to sucking or getting owned publicly, but it's important to admit that to oneself.  If you think you're the best, then you'll credit all your losses to opponent hacks or teammate inadequacy - both of which are accusations you can see in chat after pretty much any game.
---
A useful technique might be to make a similar list of things that you find yourself unable to do, and then strive to do those things.
---
But it's much better then eso pvp/campagins, believe me
---
Welcome to internet.
---
Only 500x more clicks in Inventory Wars!
---
I don't understand this argument at all. There are *tons* of skins in game to get that require no gems or lootboxes whatsoever. They release new ones pretty regularly. Yet people keep acting like these skins don't exist -- like the only skins you can *ever* get are through the gemstore.
---
Why are people so bothered about gemstore stuff? I am not a fan of lootboxes, but the Knife Tail thing is pretty nice, IMO. You're guaranteed to get something that you don't already have, which already makes it a step better than a regular lootbox. As for gemstore stuff in general... If you don't want it, don't buy it. If you *do* want it, then buy it. If you want it but you don't want to buy it, well... I'm sorry you can't have your cake and eat it, too? What do you do when you want something from a real store but don't want to buy it? Do you also throw a tantrum because it's not free, or because stealing it is illegal?
---
How do people function in the real world if they get so upset over *items actually having the gall to exist*?
---
I keep thinking of traffic lights when I see the colour combination lmao.
---
just bring a boon firebrand + ele/rev heal + 3 not terrible dps and it's a breeze
---
As for the rework, people just have to get good. Currently almost nobody has underwater gear, knows what skills do and has any idea of support underwater. Fix it and this fractal is fast and easy aswell.
---
An enterprise undertaken with risk of loss.  You cannot lose with this.  It's designed to give a high value item every time, it doesn't even contain a single piece of trash like the BLC.  You won't get a repair canister or an extractor or a revive orb.  You WILL get a skin and it WILL be one you don't have yet.  Just because you might not like that you pulled out a green gumball instead of a red one doesn't mean you didn't get a gumball out of the machine you put the quarter in.
---
And there isn't a single thing in that box that I wouldn't mind getting for the El cheapo price it is.  It's a win all the way around.  Maybe that makes me "nobody" as you put it.  But really, it's all nice shit with surprisingly good uses for way cheaper than you'd expect.  No soft wood crap, no basic blue-tier dyes. It's the nice shit.

ikr? If only you could right click your salvage kit and choose "salvage all masterwork and lower", that would be a real gamechanger.

Man, stole the thoughts right out of my noggin

Ha! Because it's a Volkswagen!
---
They aren't available yet. Sometimes they will take a few days before putting the "returning" items back into the shop
---
Fair point.
---
It wasn't my first character nor my most played character, it seems to be addressed randomly.
---
Yes and decided to do a reddit account two weeks ago. Yes that makes totally sense.
---
If we're talking strictly from a financial point... the smart thing to do would be keep playing GW2 and not dump any money at all. You don't have to buy cosmetics *or* sub to anything.
---
If you really enjoy FF14, of course, that's cool -- different strokes for different folks, after all -- I just don't understand the logic of "spend money here or money there" when you don't even have to make the choice to spend a dime if you don't want to. (Personally I tried FF14 and found it wasn't  to my tastes, and as such wasn't worth having to subscribe to play. If it was free I might tool around on it a while, but forcing me to pay money regularly just to play is, IMO, a *lot* worse than charging me nothing to keep playing while giving me the *option* of spending money on cosmetics if I want to.)

Let me know when you find it.
---
This is awesome. I want to know what my little Asura Warrior would look like I'm this art style.
---
The fractal is not hard anyway, as i said it is how it interacts with instabilities which doesn't make it harder just painful unless you do x or y for this reset. The instability don't make you require so heavily anywhere else.
---
Title drew me in. I stopped reading at "just kidding", shame, it looked interesting.
---
I know I'll get downvoted a lot for this, but anyway...
---
I wouldn't say PvP is as much about skill as it is about builds. Obviously you go super high rank skill is going to matter, but builds are just so important in this game that it's ridiculous. 
---
I'm pretty much a button smasher in PvP. I just click whatever I feel like at the time and don't really take into consideration what's actually going on around me. When I played my druid build I got something like high-silver/low gold division. The next season I decided I'd try out scrapper engineer. Having never played an engineer before - in PvE or PvP - I placed low-platinum and managed to get only 60 points from being on the leaderboard before seasons end. It just became so easy to beat others all of a sudden.
---
What I'm trying to say is that PvP is horribly unbalanced. There are few viable specs and professions. It's pretty much all about whether you have ways to clear CC and debuffs as otherwise you'll be thrown around and stunned constantly until death.
---
Incorrect, higher level fractals give more loot in exchange for increased health values, further mechanics and more incoming damage from enemies. 
---
You make it sound as if instabilities are the only thing people have to worry about in higher levels.
---
I actually learned about it when I tried changing skills underwater around a week or two ago.
---
A lot of pretty colors. Good job.
---
Better ground targeting options are a must before uw combat can ever be viable. It's fine that offensive abilities are automatically locked to your target, but AoE support abilities like Druid CA skills -need- an option to be targeted on allies quickly and efficiently in combat scenarios.  
---
Honestly, even having an artificial "ground" you could target these skills onto would work wonders. You wouldn't be able to utilize the 3d space and easily hit targets above or below your own depth, but that could be remedied with non-spherical aoe's making these skills hit targets above and below at slightly greater distances.
---
This is almost as rare as the threads asking how to make AP in WvW.
---
hard content is fine. most everyone i know loves 99 and 100 CM. this and siren's/deepstone and the molten boss/furnace rework are just fucking annoying and tedious.
---
A berserker/assassin/diviner mix for a dps/boon hybrid tempest would be fine in t4 fracs but definitely not optimal by any stretch of the imagination.
---
&gt; Tempest has the best Might/Fury granting skill in the whole game. 
---
Better than Druid? I mean it's literally one skill for 25 might and one skill for fury. 
---
Haven't played heal tempest yet, but when I saw the build on snowcrows, it's a longer rotation than any other ele builds.
---
If it worked on greens
---
Wouldn't the engi just kill itself every time?
---
they are too few and too booring to make anything interesting + they often repeat for same fractal.
---
If you're fighting champs you might be better off going condi tbh
---
Omitting the fact that the primary increase in difficulty is the increase in health pools, number of mechanics and damage does make the statement incorrect.
---
And of course instabilities can be ignored. Boon Overload feels non-existent if you rarely ever get hit and keep on protection. The duration increase does nothing if people actually play around having high uptimes to begin with. 
---
Same goes for Afflicted if you simply evade sources of damage.
---
Frailty is irrelevant if you have Swiftness to overwrite the speed increase and are capable of sustaining protection so your light armor wearers with full berserker's don't get one shot by 9k hits. 
---
Fractal Vindicators get deleted before they can even finish their spawn animation if people focus their damage and stack with one another.
---
Stick Together is a non-issue as long as somebody doesn't decide to start soloing an enemy.
---
Outflanked is negated by keeping your ass to the wall.
---
Toxic Trail may give you Poison but you barely notice that anyway.
---
Adrenaline Rush is inconsequential if you keep avoiding clear attacks from a boss and particularly if you outrace the last 10%.
---
Mist Convergence might possibly be the worst of them all in that regard, lol. At worst you damage the tentacle similarly to the vindicator or dodge the huge tell. The worst may be the abomination but even that one you can bully by just stunning and knocking it back. Super fun to watch by the way because that one just got added haphazardly. It clearly has no knockback/launch animation.
---
Condi would be stronger imo. More so curses scourge with heal on condi damage. Only power dps i can think of would be the heal on crit trait for thief
---
Sure, but 99% of the breaks that are still in game are incredibly convoluted, are class dependant, gliding is as much to blame as warclaw and/or require abusing the not intended dismount jump, most often in guarded area meaning that when breaking into structure you are bound to generate contest swords (otherwise you can't mount up) and take roughly the same time as regular taking down wall/gate, even if you practiced the break before. I would very openly say that impact of existance of exploit breaks into objectives is very small, and I've seen more flyhacks than situation where structure was obviously broken into with Warclaw.
---
Power Reaper and Revenant (both herald and renegade) are good at soloing champions.
---
Spellbreaker too, but you need to be good at using f2.
---
It does not require a rework if the addition of Challenge Modes to existing fractals would do the trick. Let people ease themselves into the content and then give them the opportunity to try a more difficult version of it with more rewards tied to it.
---
People who have been playing this stuff for months or even years are of course more likely to ask for a rework to be more difficult. But they need to keep in mind people who are new to the game. These people will hit a way bigger road bump than veterans did when they first learnt to play this content.
---
New rewards for playing the same old content is not new content, that's all these "weekly events" are. And on top of that all the festivals have become the exact same copy/paste rinse repeat boring bullshit.
---
Ahhhh I see ! I hadn't noticed the amount of mats needed were lower too for off-hand weapon shards, thanks a lot for clarifying ! :D
---
No specific build but probably a core warrior or spellbreaker. It also depends on exactly what you are looking for.
---
Something with a bit of defense that aims to take down the champ quickly is very different from one that will slowly chip away at it. I personally feel like the chipping away route doesn't count but that is a personal preference thing.
---
You can probably get through everything without a time limit using a soulbeast and one or two bears ...
---
My guild used to have serious issues with Siren's Reef until we realised one thing:
---
Literally ignore the boss until the map is clear. Always focus on adss and SOFT DPS only! Don't go all out until she reaches about 40%. After we figured this out, Siren's Reef became one of the easiest Fractal boss fights.
---
As for this one - I appreciate what they tried to do, I really do. But they literally broke their own mechanic for the boss. The mechanic was to kite it into one of those cages around it as they lit up with electricity. Obviously no one really did it because the boss was super easy. But now? It doesn't even follow you, it uses ranged attacks. Which sucks cause it could have been a cool fight if you had to drag it around the map while cleaving adds instead of watching it absorb all damage for 10 minutes.
---
Eh that's a mess tbh which was probably the point you were trying to make lol.
---
I could be wrong, but I think the jellyfish doesn't move at all now.
---
(not like we ever used the cages anyway)
---
The hardcore raiders already did.
---
Usually things come out on the gem store tuesdays and fridays, so I'm hoping it comes out tomorrow (friday)
---
Imo Tempest is far better than power Weaver in open world pve.  Better mob tagging, boon stacking, vulnerability duration, ranged options, better cleanse, more stun breaks, soothing mists, aura spam, tons of group and self healing.
---
I agree with that notion. Fire is definitely really strong in open world (downed state lava font OP), but i would like to stress again, im not asling ppl to swap off any specific traitline. Which traitline they choose to swap off is completely up to them as I'm just giving suggestions. But again that is IF they're struggling to survive but dwna change to marauder and what not. Ideal case would be the raid build is good enough since u literally melt everything and barely die if u know what to look out for.
---
Many many GW2 players have said they will be playing WoW Classic.
---
No it isn't.
---
Was it worth it?
---
This is why I always had a few packets of salt in my inventory whenever I played PvP. I would just mail it to them with a GG message after they messaged me like this lmao
---
And people say Anet doesn't add jumping puzzles anymore.

Still love your songs, but I admit I still remember the comment of someone pointing that you should have just watch porn in place of.. Well everything that started that drama.
